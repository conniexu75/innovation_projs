https://openalex.org/W2025492476,"Turbulence is one of the most fascinating phenomena in nature and one of the biggest challenges for modern physics. It is common knowledge that a flow of a simple, Newtonian fluid is likely to be turbulent, when velocity is high, viscosity is low and size of the tank is large\cite{Landau,Tritt}. Solutions of flexible long-chain polymers are known as visco-elastic fluids\cite{bird}. In our experiments we show, that flow of a polymer solution with large enough elasticity can become quite irregular even at low velocity, high viscosity and in a small tank. The fluid motion is excited in a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. The flow resistance increases by a factor of about twenty. So, while the Reynolds number, $\boldmath{Re}$, may be arbitrary low, the observed flow has all main features of developed turbulence, and can be compared to turbulent flow in a pipe at $\bf {Re\simeq 10^5}$\cite{Landau,Tritt}. This {\it elastic turbulence} is accompanied by significant stretching of the polymer molecules, and the resulting increase of the elastic stresses can reach two orders of magnitude."

Upon T cell activation, LAT becomes highly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, and Grb2, Gads, and phospholipase C (PLC)-γ1 bind LAT via Src homology-2 domains. In LAT-deficient mutant Jurkat cells, TCR engagement fails to induce ERK activation, Ca2+ flux, and activation of AP-1 and NF-AT. We mapped the tyrosine residues in LAT responsible for interaction with these specific signaling molecules by expressing LAT mutants with tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations in LAT-deficient cells. Our results showed that three distal tyrosines, Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226, are responsible for Grb2-binding; Tyr171, and Tyr191, but not Tyr226, are necessary for Gads binding. Mutation of Tyr132 alone abolished PLC-γ1 binding. Mutation of all three distal tyrosines also abolished PLC-γ1 binding, suggesting there might be multiple binding sites for PLC-γ1. Mutation of Tyr132 affected calcium flux and blocked Erk and NF-AT activation. Since Grb2 binding is not affected by this mutation, these results strongly suggest that PLC-γ activation regulates Ras activation in these cells. Mutation of individual Grb2 binding sites had no functional effect, but mutation of two or three of these sites, in combination, also affected Erk and NF-AT activation.

Upon LAT tyrosine phosphorylation, multiple adaptor molecules and enzymes critical to T cell activation bind to LAT directly by virtue of the SH2 domains that these proteins contain. These proteins can also bring other associated molecules to these LAT-nucleated complexes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that following TCR binding, phosphorylated LAT associates with Grb2, Gads, SOS, PLC-γ1, Vav, SLP-76, Cbl, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The enzymes recruited by LAT can themselves be activated in these complexes by tyrosine phosphorylation and find higher concentrations of their substrates in the plasma membrane. In particular, phospholipase-Cγ is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation to cleave phosphoinositides into diacylglycerol, an activator of protein kinase C, and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which induces intracellular calcium elevation (3Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small G proteins Rac, Rho, and cdc42, also activates its enzymatic activity (4Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and SOS, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, are not activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells but are recruited to the membrane following receptor engagement via interaction with adaptor proteins (5Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar,6Buday L. Egan S.E. Rodriguez Viciana P. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The central role of LAT in T cell activation has also been demonstrated in several other experiments. The LAT gene has been disrupted by gene targeting experiments, and intrathymic development in the resulting mice is completely blocked at an early stage (7Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Burshtyn D.N. Stebbins C.C. DeJarnette J.B. Trible R.P. Grinberg A. Tsay H.C. Jacobs H.M. Kessler C.M. Long E.O. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Thus receptor-mediated events in immature T cells are dependent on the presence of LAT, and presumably, the molecules LAT recruits in these cells. In Jurkat T cells, overexpression of a mutant form of LAT lacking two tyrosine residues predicted to bind Grb2 had a dominant negative effect on T cell signaling (1Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Following TCR activation of cells expressing this mutant, a number of signaling molecules failed to bind to the mutant LAT molecule, and TCR-coupled transcriptional events, AP-1 and NF-AT activation, were partially disrupted. The functional significance of the LAT molecule in signaling events coupled to the TCR was clearly demonstrated in the study of two independently derived Jurkat T cell variants (8Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 9Zhang W. Irvin B.J. Trible R.P. Abraham R.T. Samelson L.E. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Both of these lines were shown to be deficient in LAT expression. TCR engagement in these two lines failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, calcium elevation, Ras and Erk activation, or transcriptional activation of AP-1 and NF-AT. These defects were corrected by expression of wild-type LAT. The importance of this molecule in regulating both intrathymic T cell development and activation of mature T cells, as modeled by the Jurkat cell line, led us to investigate the specificity of binding to LAT. Can the interaction of multiple signaling molecules be mapped to particular LAT tyrosine residues? The existence of the LAT-deficient cell lines enabled us to perform such a structure-function analysis of the LAT protein. In this study we stably express LAT tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants to test the role of individual tyrosines and combinations of tyrosine residues in the cytosolic tail of LAT. We demonstrate that specific tyrosine residues do bind distinct signaling molecules, showing that one particular tyrosine residue (Tyr132) is critical for LAT function and thus for T cell activation. Other individual tyrosines when mutated alone have no effect on LAT binding and signaling, but combinations of these mutations have a deleterious effect on signaling initiated through the TCR. The antibodies used in our studies are: rabbit polyclonal anti-LAT (1Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), the C305 monoclonal antibody binding the Jurkat TCR (10Weiss A. Wiskocil R.L. Stobo J.D. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 123-128PubMed Google Scholar), anti-Gads (11Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and anti-Erk2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-SLP-76 (Transduction Laboratory), anti-CD3ε (OKT3), anti-Myc (9E10), and monoclonal anti-PLC-γ1 and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) from Upstate Biotechnology. Mutant LAT constructs in the mammalian expression vector pCEFL were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing. This vector contains the EF promoter and the neo gene. Jurkat cells (E6.1) and LAT-deficient cells (J.CaM2.5) (8Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To establish stable cell lines expressing different LAT mutants, J.CaM2.5 cells were electroporated with 10 μg of plasmid under conditions described previously (1Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Stable clones were selected in the presence of 1.2 mg/ml G418. All of the transfectants were screened for TCR expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and for LAT expression by anti-LAT immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation, Jurkat cells (108 cells/ml) were either stimulated with C305 (1:50 tissue culture supernatant) for 1.5 min or left untreated. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Brij, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4) with protease inhibitors. Protein samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibody or rabbit polyclonal antisera. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by detection with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The measurement for intracellular free Ca2+ was done using Fluo-3-AM (6 μg/ml) and Fura-Red (10 μg/ml) (Molecular Probes). Cells were preloaded with the dyes for 30 min at 37 °C and then kept at room temperature for 20 min. Cells preloaded with dyes were washed with RPMI without fetal bovine serum once and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson). OKT3 ascites (1:100) were used to induce Ca2+ flux in those stable transfectants. Ca2+ levels were indicated by Fluo-3/Fura-Red fluorescence intensity ratio determined using FCSAssistant software. For the luciferase assay, 1.6 × 106 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of pNFAT-luciferase plasmid and 0.5 μg of pCEFL-LAT plasmid. 24 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with OKT3 coated on microtiter plates and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (1.5 μm) or left untreated for 6 h. Luciferase activity was assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). For the Erk kinase assay, Jurkat cells were stimulated with C305 for 10 min or left untreated. Anti-Erk2 immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 13 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA). The kinase reaction was performed using 10 μg myelin basic protein as a substrate and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per reaction. The LAT-deficient Jurkat cell line, J.CaM2.5, is defective in Ras-MAPK activation and Ca2+ flux in response to anti-TCR or anti-CD3 antibody stimulation (8Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). We used this cell line to establish stable transfectants expressing different LAT mutants containing substitutions of critical tyrosines with phenylalanines. Based on the extensive characterization of SH2 binding preferences, one can determine that sequences around tyrosines 171 (YVNV), 191 (YVNV), and 226 (YENL) form classical Grb2-binding motifs (YXN), whereas Tyr132 (YLVV) is in a potential PLC-γ1-binding motif (12Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). To make constructs expressing mutant forms of LAT, each of these tyrosines was mutated to phenylalanine either separately or in different combinations. LAT 2YF, with mutations at Tyr171and Tyr191, was previously shown to inhibit NF-AT- and AP-1-mediated transcription when overexpressed in wild-type Jurkat cells (1Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). 3YF, with mutations at Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226, was made to remove these three potential Grb2-binding motifs to test the effect of these mutations on the LAT-Grb2 interaction. We also made a mutant, 4YF, with mutations at Tyr132, Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226. These constructs were introduced into J.CaM2.5 cells by electroporation. Stable clones were selected with G418. All clones were screened for LAT expression, as well as for CD3 surface expression as determined by flow cytometry using an anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3). Multiple clones for each mutant were obtained and analyzed biochemically and functionally. Although we did extensive screening of many clones for each mutant, it was very difficult to match TCR and LAT expression exactly among different stable transfectants. In these experiments, we show that all but one of the cell lines expressing mutant LAT are well matched for expression of the transfected cDNA (Fig. 1). The conclusions that we draw about LAT function in TCR signaling take these clonal variations into consideration. To test whether mutant LAT molecules from these stable transfectants could be tyrosine phosphorylated upon TCR ligation, we activated these transfectants with an anti-TCR antibody (C305), immunoprecipitated the Myc-tagged LAT with anti-Myc antibody, and detected LAT phosphorylation by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting. As shown in Fig.2, all of the mutant LAT molecules were tyrosine phosphorylated following activation. The tyrosine phosphorylation of the Y226F protein appeared to be low compared with other mutant LAT molecules, but this was probably due to the low level of expression of this mutant, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Surprisingly, the LAT 4YF mutant, which had mutations at four tyrosines, was still tyrosine phosphorylated after TCR stimulation, suggesting that tyrosines other than Tyr132, Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226 are also phosphorylated. Endogenous LAT in E6.1 Jurkat cells was not detected in these anti-Myc immunoprecipitates. LAT has several potential Grb2-binding sites. To see whether the association of LAT with Grb2 was affected by mutations at the distal three, Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226 or at the Tyr132 site, we immunoprecipitated Grb2 from activated Jurkat cells and detected the presence of LAT with an anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot. As shown in Fig.3, Grb2 could associate with most LAT mutants except 3YF and 4YF. The amount of LAT association with Grb2 correlated with the amount of LAT expression (as shown in Fig. 1) for WT, Y132F, Y171F, Y191F, and Y226F. The fact that mutation of these tyrosines individually did not abolish Grb2-binding indicates that there are multiple binding sites for Grb2. The amount of 2YF mutant associated with Grb2 was significantly reduced compared with Y191F (Y191F and 2YF had similar amounts of LAT expression), suggesting that Tyr171 is one of the Grb2-binding sites. There was no LAT-Grb2 association in 3YF, indicating that Tyr226 is also involved in LAT-Grb2 association. We can conclude that at least Tyr171 and Tyr226 bind Grb2 upon phosphorylation. Since Tyr191 has the same binding motif as Tyr171, YVNV, Tyr191 might also be a Grb2-binding site. Other potential Grb2-binding sites seem not to be involved in Grb2 binding. Gads is a newly identified Grb2-like adaptor protein exclusively expressed in hematopoietic tissues. It has been isolated independently by a number of investigators (13Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3073-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Bourette R.P. Arnaud S. Myles G.M. Blanchet J.P. Rohrschneider L.R. Mouchiroud G.

Commun. 1998; 253: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Asada H. Ishii N. Sasaki Y. Endo K. Kasai H. Tanaka N. Takeshita T. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Sugamura K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Law C. Ewings M.K. Chaudhary P.M. Solow S.A. Yun T.J. Marshall A.J. Hood L. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain of Gads was shown to have a similar binding specificity as that of the Grb2 SH2 domain (13Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3073-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It was reported that the SH2 domain of Gads binds LAT and its C-terminal SH3 domain binds the proline-rich region of SLP-76. It was thought that Gads bridges the association of SLP-76 with LAT. We immunoprecipitated Gads from lysates of C305-stimulated transfectants. The association of Gads with LAT was detected using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 4, this antibody precipitated similar amounts of Gads detected by anti-Gads blotting and of SLP-76 detected by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting. LAT was present in Gads immunoprecipitates from C305-stimulated Jurkat cells (E6.1) and not from unstimulated cells as previously reported. The amount of LAT associated with Gads was comparable in WT, Y132F, and Y171F. The amount of Y191F associated with Gads was reduced significantly compared with Y132F and WT LAT (Y191F had an expression level similar to WT and Y132F), suggesting that Tyr191 is a binding site for Gads SH2 domain upon phosphorylation. It appeared that the association of Y226F LAT with Gads was also reduced, although this may be due to the low expression of Y226F. Thus, Y226F might not mediate a LAT-Gads interaction. This conclusion was supported by the data from the 2YF and 3YF transfectants. In 2YF, Tyr171 and Tyr191were both mutated to phenylalanines. These two mutations abolished the binding of Gads with LAT, suggesting that Tyr171 and Tyr191, and not Tyr226, are the binding sites for Gads. Because it is thought that Gads mediates the interaction between SLP-76 and LAT, we also examined the association of LAT with SLP-76 (Fig. 2). SLP-76 is present in anti-LAT immunoprecipitates from WT transfectants. The amount of SLP-76 associated with LAT was reduced slightly in Y191F and was abolished in the 2YF, 3YF, and 4YF mutants. Y226F had a similar amount of SLP-76 associated as WT LAT even though its expression was relatively low. It appeared that more SLP-76 was associated with Y171F compared with WT. However, since the expression level of Y171F was the highest among all these stable clones, the mutation of Tyr171 alone might not have any effect on LAT association with SLP-76. These results confirm the above conclusion that Tyr171 and Tyr191 are the only two sites involved in Gads and thus in SLP-76 binding. We also examined the association of LAT with PLC-γ1. Previous studies showed that LAT was required for PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent Ca2+ flux (18Stoica B. DeBell K.E. Graham L. Rellahan B.L. Alava M.A. Laborda J. Bonvini E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar). LAT has one predicted PLC-γ1-binding site at Tyr132 (YLVV). PLC-γ1 was immunoprecipitated from the wild-type and mutant LAT transfectants activated with C305. As shown in Fig. 5, mutation of this tyrosine completely abolished the association of LAT with PLC-γ1, indicating that Tyr132 is involved in the binding of PLC-γ1. However, mutations at other tyrosines also affected the LAT-PLC-γ1 association. Compared with WT, the associations of the Y171F and Y226F mutants with PLC-γ1 were not affected. In Y191F, this association was obviously reduced. When both Tyr171 and Tyr191were mutated as in 2YF, a similar amount of 2YF LAT was associated with PLC-γ1 as was bound in the Y191 F mutant, suggesting that Tyr171 might not be involved in LAT-PLC-γ1 interaction. Furthermore, when Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226 were all mutated (3YF), the LAT-PLC-γ1 association was abolished, suggesting that phosphorylation at Tyr226might also contribute to LAT-PLC-γ1 interaction. We also examined whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 is affected by these mutations. The tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 was restored in WT and in those mutants (Y171F, Y191F, Y226F, and 2YF) in which LAT interacted with PLC-γ1. Phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 in Y132F and 3YF transfectants was only slightly increased compared with that in J.CaM2.5. In the 4YF transfectant, PLC-γ1 was not tyrosine phosphorylated at all after TCR ligation as in JCaM2.5. It has been proposed that phosphorylated LAT recruits the Grb2·Sos complex to the plasma membrane where Sos activates Ras followed by activation of the MAPK pathway (1Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). In LAT-deficient cells, Erk activation after TCR ligation was defective, and transfection of LAT into these cells reconstituted Erk activation. We next tested Erk kinase activation in the LAT stable transfectants using myelin basic protein as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 6, the activation of Erk extracted from J.CaM2.5 was greatly reduced compared with E6.1 cells. Expression of WT, Y171F, Y191F, and Y226F forms of LAT reconstituted the TCR-mediated Erk activation. This could be explained by the observation that mutation at Tyr171, Tyr191, or Tyr226 did not result in a significant loss of Grb2 association. However, Y132F, 2YF, 3YF, and 4YF all failed to restore Erk activation. The failure of Erk activation in these transfectants was not due to a kinetic difference in Erk activation (data not shown). The failure of these mutants to restore Ras-MAPK activation could be due to two different mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 3, the binding of LAT to Grb2 was not affected by the Y132F mutation, suggesting that the recruitment of the Grb2·Sos complex to other sites was not sufficient for Erk activation. Activation of PLC-γ1 following interaction at the Tyr132 site and subsequent activation of PKC could be necessary for Erk activation mediated via the TCR. The effect of Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226mutations as shown in 2YF and 3YF could be due to reduced Grb2 binding to LAT and thus less recruitment of the Grb2·Sos complex to the plasma membrane. In this model, the recruitment of Grb2·Sos and the activation of PLC-γ1 and PKC are required for activation of Erk after T cell activation. Additionally, the decrease in Erk activation in these mutants could also reflect, to some extent, decreases in PLC-γ1 activation as discussed above. LAT is required for Ca2+ flux following T cell activation as demonstrated in LAT-deficient cells (8Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 9Zhang W. Irvin B.J. Trible R.P. Abraham R.T. Samelson L.E. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We further analyzed the LAT transfectants to see whether the LAT mutations affected Ca2+ flux initiated via the TCR. Mutation at either Tyr171, Tyr191, or Tyr226had no effect on Ca2+ flux after addition of OKT3 (data not shown). Mutations at both Tyr171 and Tyr191 or at Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226 also had no obvious effect on Ca2+ mobilization (Fig.7 A). Mutation of all four tyrosines, 4YF (Tyr132, Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226) led to defective Ca2+ flux in this transfectant. Mutation of Tyr132 alone had a marked effect on Ca2+ flux compared with WT transfectants. In this particular transfectant, Ca2+ flux in the initial phase was normal or elevated, whereas in the sustained phase calcium levels were much reduced (Fig.7 B). To confirm this result, we also tested several different clones of Y132F with different levels of LAT expression. All of these clones showed a similar phenotype (data not shown). A number of conclusions follow from these data. The results suggest that the association of LAT with PLC-γ1 is not essential for the initial Ca2+ flux. In both Y132F and 3YF, the interaction of PLC-γ1 and LAT was abolished by these mutations. However, both of these transfectants flux Ca2+, although the interaction of PLC-γ1 with Y132 appears necessary for normal calcium dynamics. In addition, optimal phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 might not be necessary for Ca2+ flux initiated via the TCR. The tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 in Y132F and 3YF was much less than in WT (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, the observation that 4YF fails to flux Ca2+ like LAT deficient-J.CaM2.5 demonstrates that interactions mediated by some combination of these residues is critical to the calcium response. Since many of the tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations affected Erk activation and Ca2+ flux, we next tested whether these mutations affected NF-AT-mediated transcription following T cell activation. We transiently transfected the NFAT/luciferase reporter construct with different LAT mutant constructs separately. The luciferase expression is driven by a promoter consisting of tandem AP-1 and NF-AT binding sites. As shown in Fig. 8, cotransfection of WT LAT into the J.CaM2 cells restored the NF-AT-mediated transcription following OKT3 stimulation, whereas cotransfection of the empty vector (pCEFL) had no effect. Transfection with the Y132F LAT mutant failed to reconstitute NF-AT transcription. In contrast, expression of the other single tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants restored NF-AT activation. Compared with WT, NF-AT activation in Y226F was reduced even though Erk activation and Ca2+ flux appeared to be normal. This assay may be sensitive to the lower levels of LAT protein seen in this clone (as above). NF-AT activation in 2YF was not restored to normal levels. No NF-AT activation over base-line levels was observed following activation of the 3YF or 4YF mutants. The NF-AT reporter construct contains a composite binding site for both NF-AT and AP-1. Thus, a defect in either AP-1 or NF-AT activation would lead to failure of transcriptional activation as indicated by the luciferase reporter. The failure of Erk activation demonstrated in the Y132F and the 3YF mutants as well as Ca2+ flux abnormalities in Tyr132 and 4YF explain the failure of NF-AT activation detected in this assay. The importance of LAT for T cell signaling has been documented using various experimental approaches. Extensive co-immunoprecipitation studies before and after the cloning of LAT demonstrated that this molecule, after phosphorylation on its multiple tyrosines, interacts with several critical signaling proteins including both enzymes and adaptor proteins (1Zhang W.

Gene-targeting experiments demonstrated that the absence of LAT expression had a profound effect on T cell development (7Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Burshtyn D.N. Stebbins C.C. DeJarnette J.B. Trible R.P. Grinberg A. Tsay H.C. Jacobs H.M. Kessler C.M. Long E.O. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). No mature T cells were observed in mice without LAT. The block in thymocyte development occurred at a stage at which cells bear the pre-TCR and require intact signaling pathways to induce TCR α-chain rearrangement and expression of CD4 and CD8 co-receptor molecules. In the absence of normal T cells lacking LAT, the study of the role of LAT in mature T cells has depended on the Jurkat tumor line model. Two independently derived LAT-deficient Jurkat cell lines have been shown to be defective in many signaling events dependent on TCR cross-linking, including Ras-MAPK activation, Ca2+ flux, and NF-AT transcription, although the activation of the protein tyrosine kinases that function in TCR signaling was normal in these cells (8Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 9Zhang W. Irvin B.J. Trible R.P. Abraham R.T. Samelson L.E. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). All of these defects were corrected by re-expression of LAT following transfection. These cells have been successfully used to study the importance of two cysteine residues for LAT palmitoylation, intracellular localization, and signaling (9Zhang W. Irvin B.J. Trible R.P. Abraham R.T. Samelson L.E. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 21Lin J. Weiss A. Finco T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28861-28864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We used LAT-deficient Jurkat T cells in this study to probe the contribution to the TCR signaling pathway of individual and sets of tyrosine residues in the cytosolic tail of LAT (Fig.9). The three most distal tyrosine residues (residues 171, 191, and 226) are in the sequence context YXNX, which is a perfect motif for Grb2 SH2 binding after phosphorylation. Independent mutation of each of these YXNX sites showed only slight quantitative effects in biochemical and functional studies. However, because of the difficulty of exactly matching LAT and TCR-CD3 levels among those transfectants, and because of other unexplained clonal variations, it is difficult to be certain of the significance of these subtle defects. The significance of at least two of these tyrosine residues, Tyr171 and Tyr191, was shown in our previous study in which overexpression of mutant LAT with the double Y171F/Y191F mutation resulted in inhibition of LAT association with other signaling molecules and reduced activation of AP-1 and NF-AT following TCR cross-linking (1Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). In the current study, the double Y171F/Y191F mutation had a significant effect on molecular binding and function. A decrease in Grb2 and PLC-γ1 and a loss of Gads binding were observed. The interaction of SLP-76 with LAT was also affected in these mutants. The loss of SLP-76 binding that occurred with the 2YF could be explained by previous studies showing that Gads mediates the association of SLP-76 with LAT (11Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 16Asada H. Ishii N. Sasaki Y. Endo K. Kasai H. Tanaka N. Takeshita T. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Sugamura K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Law C. Ewings M.K. Chaudhary P.M. Solow S.A. Yun T.J. Marshall A.J. Hood L. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The defects observed with the 2YF mutant might explain the functional inhibition caused by overexpression of this mutant in WT Jurkat cells. The triple 3YF failed to bind Grb2 or Gads. From these data, we conclude that there is a subtle difference in the binding of the Grb2 and Gads SH2 domains. Grb2 can bind Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226when they are phosphorylated, and Gads can only bind Tyr171and Tyr191 but not Tyr226. An unexpected result was the loss of binding of PLC-γ1 in the 3YF (Y171F/Y191F/Y226F) mutant. Neither of the PLC-γ1 SH2 domains would be predicted to bind these three sites with high affinity, although it is possible that once one of these SH2 domains binds a more favorable site (see below), the other would tolerate a lower affinity interaction. Alternatively, the interaction of PLC-γ1 with the 171, 191, and 226 sites could be indirect and mediated, for example, via Grb2 or Gads. Whatever the explanation of this binding data, the functional effect of these three mutations was considerable, although not complete. The loss of Grb2 binding correlated with a loss of Erk and NF-AT activation. It is surprising that this mutant still mediated TCR-induced Ca2+ flux, although the binding of PLC-γ1 with LAT was abolished and there was no significant increase of PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation. More extensive studies need to be performed to explain this result. The single mutation at Y132 had a profound and unexpected effect on signaling. The phosphorylated sequence YLVV was predicted to bind either PLC-γ1 SH2 domain, although in the original characterization the PLC-γ1 N-SH2 domain favors leucine in the +1 position (12Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). It was showed previously, prior to the cloning of the LAT, that the N-SH2 domain of PLC-γ1 binds to LAT and that this interaction is critical for TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 (18Stoica B. DeBell K.E. Graham L. Rellahan B.L. Alava M.A. Laborda J. Bonvini E. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1059-1066PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, the C-SH2 domain might interact with one of the sites deleted in 3YF, as discussed above. Our studies on the Y132F mutant support and extend this result. Tyr132 is required for both PLC-γ1 binding and tyrosine phosphorylation. The Y132F mutant demonstrated abnormal calcium flux in response to TCR cross-linking. The initial peak of calcium elevation was present, but persistent elevation of calcium was not observed. This result also cannot be completely reconciled with the current understanding of intracellular calcium regulation (22Putney Jr., J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14669-14671Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In current models, the initial spike is attributed to PLC activation leading to IP3production. IP3 binds to intracellular IP3receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, causing rapid calcium release from intraorganellar stores. How this happens in the absence of PLCγ binding to LAT or PLC phosphorylation in cells expressing Y132F is not clear. The second phase of calcium entry is thought to be induced by the depletion of intraorganellar stores of calcium, which when sensed by the cell results in the opening of membrane calcium channels leading to calcium influx. In lymphocytes this latter pathway has been shown to be dependent on the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases. In B cells lacking Btk and in T cells lacking Itk, calcium flux is limited to the initial rapid elevation as was seen with the Y132F mutation (23Fluckiger A.C. Li Z. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 24Liu K.Q. Bunnell S.C. Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Itk has been found to bind to tyrosine phosphorylated SLP-76, which, as described above, is recruited to LAT via Gads binding (25Bunnell S.C. Diehn M. Yaffe M.B. Findell P.R. Cantley L.C. Berg L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2219-2230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The loss of SLP-76 in Jurkat cells is associated with abnormal calcium flux (26Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The Y132F mutation does not inhibit Gads binding, but a slight decrease in SLP-76 associated with the Tyr132 mutant LAT was detected (Fig. 2), perhaps because PLC binding normally stabilizes SLP-76 at LAT. Itk might bind LAT by multiple mechanisms (27Shan X. Wange R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29323-29330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but both a loss of PLC and a decrease in SLP-76 binding to LAT would likely result in a deleterious effect on Itk binding and function. The lack of PLC-γ1 binding in the Y132F mutant is also likely to contribute to the failure of Erk activation in cells expressing this mutant. A similar finding has been observed in B cells lacking PLCγ (28Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The authors of this study attribute the failure of Erk activation not to a failure of calcium flux but to a lack of PKC activation, caused by the PLCγ deficiency. In addition, the absence of the Tec kinases in T cells with the consequent lack of PLC activation led in another study to failure of Erk activation (29Schaeffer E.M. Debnath J. Yap G. McVicar D. Liao X.C. Littman D.R. Sher A. Varmus H.E. Lenardo M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Science. 1999; 284: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The effect of the Y132F mutant on NF-AT activation in view of the failure of Erk activation is expected. The standard model for activation of Erk depends on the SOS-dependent activation of Ras, which is independent of PKC. Our results suggest that an alternative, PKC-dependent activation of Ras and thus ERK exists, as suggested prior to the characterization of SOS (30Izquierdo M. Downward J. Graves J.D. Cantrell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3305-3312Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, the 4YF mutation fails to interact with any of the proteins we tested, and in cells expressing only this mutant no reconstitution of the LAT null phenotype is observed in calcium, ERK, or NF-AT assays. Nonetheless, some level of TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is detected on this protein. In this study, we have shown that the four distal tyrosine residues of LAT are important for association with critical signaling molecules and thus for LAT function. An important question that remains is whether these four tyrosines are indeed phosphorylated in vivo. In our initial purification of LAT from activated Jurkat cells, mass spectroscopy revealed phosphorylation at Tyr191 (1Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). In ongoing studies, a set of mutants has been made in which all tyrosines in LAT have been mutated to phenylalanine except for, individually, Tyr132, Tyr171, Tyr191, or Tyr226. 2M. Zhu and W. Zhang, unpublished data. Upon expression of each of these individual mutants in LAT-deficient cells, TCR cross-linking results in phosphorylation in LAT mutants containing tyrosine only at position 171, 191, or 226. The mutant containing only Tyr132 is not phosphorylated, although all of the results of the mutation at this site presented in this study strongly suggest that phosphorylation occurs on this tyrosine. Additional studies are directed at uncovering the requirements for phosphorylation at this site. Future studies will need to define further all of the sites of phosphorylation. Characterization of other, as yet undetermined interactions and of the role of all of these sites on normal T cell activation and development are in progress. We thank Dr. A.

https://openalex.org/W2084901974,"Living systems exhibit form and function on multiple length scales and at multiple locations. In order to mimic such natural structures, it is necessary to develop efficient strategies for assembling hierarchical materials. Conventional photolithography, although ubiquitous in the fabrication of microelectronics and microelectromechanical systems, is impractical for defining feature sizes below 0.1 micrometres and poorly suited to pattern chemical functionality. Recently, so-called 'soft' lithographic approaches have been combined with surfactant and particulate templating procedures to create materials with multiple levels of structural order. But the materials thus formed have been limited primarily to oxides with no specific functionality, and the associated processing times have ranged from hours to days. Here, using a self-assembling 'ink' we combine silica-surfactant self-assembly with three rapid printing procedures--pen lithography, ink-jet printing, and dip-coating of patterned self-assembled monolayers--to form functional, hierarchically organized structures in seconds. The rapid-prototyping procedures we describe are simple, employ readily available equipment, and provide a link between computer-aided design and self-assembled nanostructures. We expect that the ability to form arbitrary functional designs on arbitrary surfaces will be of practical importance for directly writing sensor arrays and fluidic or photonic systems."
https://openalex.org/W1510237891,"Osteopontin protects endothelial cells from apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal. This interaction is mediated by the αvβ3 integrin and is NF-κB-dependent (Scatena, M., Almeida, M., Chaisson, M. L., Fausto, N., Nicosia, R. F., and Giachelli, C. M. (1998) J. Cell Biol. 141, 1083–1093). In the present study we used differential cloning to identify osteopontin-induced, NF-κB-dependent genes in endothelial cells. One of the genes identified in this screen was osteoprotegerin, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. By Northern and Western blot analysis, osteoprotegerin mRNA and protein levels were very low in endothelial cells plated on the non-integrin cell attachment factor, poly-d-lysine. In contrast, osteoprotegerin mRNA and protein levels were induced 5–7-fold following αvβ3 ligation by osteopontin. Osteoprotegerin induction by osteopontin was time-dependent and observed as early as 3 h following treatment. NF-κB inactivation achieved by over expression of an IκB super repressor in endothelial cells completely inhibited osteoprotegerin induction by osteopontin. Finally, purified osteoprotegerin protected endothelial cells with inactive NF-κB from apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation. These data suggest that αvβ3-mediated endothelial survival depends on osteoprotegerin induction by NF-κB and indicate a new function for osteoprotegerin in endothelial cells. Osteopontin protects endothelial cells from apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal. This interaction is mediated by the αvβ3 integrin and is NF-κB-dependent (Scatena, M., Almeida, M., Chaisson, M. L., Fausto, N., Nicosia, R. F., and Giachelli, C. M. (1998) J.

The angiogenic process requires endothelial cells to acquire an altered phenotype, modify cell-cell contacts, migrate, proliferate, and re-establish cell-cell contacts to form patent tubes or endothelial sheets. Finally, mechanisms that control microvessel regression balance pro-angiogenic processes to regulate the extent, magnitude, and duration of angiogenesis. It has become apparent that up-regulation of mechanisms that promote endothelial survival are essential during angiogenesis. This requirement was underscored by studies showing that inhibitors of αvβ3 integrin (but not β1 integrins) block angiogenesis by inducing apoptosis of migrating endothelial cells (1.Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar). While the precise mechanism by which blockade of αvβ3 induces apoptosis of endothelial cells is not clear, previous studies suggest that αvβ3 ligation modulates expression of apoptosis-regulatory genes (2.Stromblad S. Becker J.C. Yebra M. Brooks P.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 3.Zhang Z. Vuori K. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). For example, αvβ3 blockade caused activation of p53 and down-regulation of bcl-2 in endothelial cells isolated from CAM (2.Stromblad S. Becker J.C. Yebra M. Brooks P.C. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies implicate αvβ3-mediated activation of NF-κB as an important endothelial cell survival pathway (4.Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The transcription factor NF-κB is a pleiotropic regulator of many genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. The NF-κB family of proteins consists of homo- or heterodimeric subunits of the Rel family. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is localized in the cytoplasm in complex with an inhibitory protein, IκB (5.Baldwin A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5553) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, the inhibitory IκB becomes phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and subsequently degraded by the proteosome machinery (6.Palombella V. Rando O. Goldberg A. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). This allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, bind DNA, and transactivate transcription of specific genes. In endothelial cells, apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation was blocked by osteopontin, an αvβ3 ligand (4.Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The protective effect of osteopontin required nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, NF-κB, since overexpression of a nondegradable form of IκB (super repressor) blocked the effect. Several recent studies have implicated NF-κB as an important cell survival factor (4.Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 7.Beg A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 8.Liu Z.G. Hsu H.

In support of this, NF-κB has been shown to up-regulate transcription of antiapoptotic molecules such as A1, A20, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP, TRAF2, and MnSOD (10.Bertrand F. Desbois-Mouthon C. Cadoret A.

To determine whether these or unique factors might be responsible for the protective effects of NF-κB in endothelial cells, we used suppressive subtraction hybridization to isolate endothelial genes that required active NF-κB for induction by osteopontin. Here we report that one of the clones isolated in this screen was osteoprotegerin, a soluble member of the TNF1 receptor superfamily and the recently discovered osteoclast differentiation inhibitory factor. We show that adding recombinant osteoprotegerin to endothelial cells prevents apoptosis due to serum withdrawal and NF-κB blockade. These studies are the first to describe endothelial cell expression of osteoprotegerin and its potential role in endothelial cell survival mediated by integrin ligation. Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) and RAECΔN2 were passaged in MCDB 131 and RPMI 1640 medium, respectively, as described previously (4.Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). RAECΔN2 cells express a nondegradable form of IκB (IκB super repressor) under the control of the zinc-inducible metallothionein promoter. We previously determined that translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus in RAECΔN2 cells was inhibited when these cells were treated with 50 μmZnSO4 (4.Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N.

A subtracted library of cDNAs overexpressed by endothelial cells plated on osteopontin and dependent on NF-κB activation was made using the PCR-Select kit from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). In brief, poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from RAECΔN2 cells that were plated on osteopontin in the presence or absence of 50 μmZnSO4 for 4 h using the Invitrogen FAStrac poly(A)+ prep kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). In the presence of zinc, NF-κB activity is blocked due to activation of the metallothionein promoter that drives expression of the dominant IκB super repressor (4.Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). One μg of RNA from each of the samples was used to prepare a population of subtracted cDNA clones from the cells grown on osteopontin in the absence of ZnSO4 (NF-κB active) using the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Osteopontin-induced, NF-κB-dependent clones were subcloned into pCR2.1 using the T-A cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The ligation mixture was transfected into SURE cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Single colonies were picked and screened for inserts using PCR. Randomly picked clones were sequenced using the T7 primer in pCR2.1 and sequences submitted for BLAST analysis using public domain NCBI data bases for nonredundant sequences and expressed sequence tags. Total RNA was isolated from confluent RAEC and RAECΔN2 cells and analyzed as described previously (14.Malyankar U.M. Hanson R. Schwartz S.M. Ridall A.L. Giachelli C.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was carried out by electrophoretic separation of 10 μg of total RNA using formaldehyde-agarose gels and subsequent transfer. Equal loading of RNA in the lanes was confirmed by examination of the membrane after staining with methylene blue. Relative levels of RNA were determined using the phosphorimager analysis facility in the Department of Pathology at the University of Washington. For Northern blot analyses, cDNA inserts were labeled using the Multiprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-32P]dCTP. RNA levels were normalized using a radiolabeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe as described previously (14.Malyankar U.M. Hanson R. Schwartz S.M. Ridall A.L. Giachelli C.M. Exp.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 dye (Molecular Bioprobes, Eugene, OR). Condensed and fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic. In the studies involving inhibition of apoptosis recombinant osteoprotegerin (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to the cells. RAECΔN2 cells were plated on osteopontin for 16 h in the presence and absence of ZnSO4 as described earlier. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, removed mechanically, incubated in FACS medium (RPMI 1640 containing 2% FCS and 0.1% sodium azide) and treated with a FDCR-1 antiserum or preimmune serum at a dilution of 1:1000 at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed, fixed using 1% paraformaldehyde, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti rabbit antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 30 min and analyzed by flow cytometry (15.Yun T.J. Chaudhary P.M. Shu G.L. Frazer J.K. Ewings M.K. Schwartz S.M. Pascual V. Hood L.E. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6113-6121PubMed Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that growth factor-deprived endothelial cells undergo apoptosis when integrin-mediated adhesion is blocked. We have also shown that in cells plated on osteopontin, cell survival is mediated by αvβ3 integrin and dependent on translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (4.Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). We have, as part of our previous studies, prepared a cell line RAECΔN2 that overexpresses a nondegradable form of IκB (super repressor) and is regulated by the metallothionein promoter. Using these cells, we showed that translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and activity in RAECΔN2 cells was inhibited following treatment with 50 μmZnSO4 (4.Scatena M. Almeida M. Chaisson M.L. Fausto N. Nicosia R.F. Giachelli C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), because the super repressor IκB cannot be phosphorylated and thus is not proteolytically degraded. To find genes that play a role in endothelial cell survival, we created a subtraction library of clones from RAECΔN2 cells that were plated on osteopontin in serum-free medium and had active NF-κB. These cells undergo apoptosis when ZnSO4 is added to the media, thereby inactivating NF-κB (Fig.1 A). cDNAs were prepared from cells subjected to these two different conditions and used in a suppressive subtraction hybridization technique (Fig. 1 B). The subtracted inserts from the population of cells containing active NF-κB were cloned into a plasmid vector, pCR2.1. Random clones were picked from the subtracted library, sequenced, and used for BLAST analysis using the NCBI data bases to identify the clones. The clones were tabulated depending on function (TableI), and their expression levels in apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells were analyzed by Northern blotting. As seen from this table, a number of the genes isolated (VCAM-1, iNOS, etc.) have been shown previously to be regulated by NF-κB and involved in endothelial inflammatory processes (16.Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Of interest, one of the genes that we isolated in this screen was osteoprotegerin, which is required for osteoclast differentiation and blocks TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (17.Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L.

Expression of osteoprotegerin in endothelial cell has not been previously demonstrated therefore expression and function of osteoprotegerin in endothelial cells was investigated.Table Iαvβ3-induced, NF-κB-dependent endothelial cell genes Open table in a new tab We isolated total RNA from RAECΔN2 cells that were plated in serum-free medium on osteopontin for 20 h in the presence or absence of ZnSO4 and used this RNA in a Northern blot. As shown in Fig. 2 A, cells plated on osteopontin in the absence of zinc (NF-κB active) express a high level of osteoprotegerin mRNA, while cells plated in the presence of zinc (NF-κB-inactive) do not express osteoprotegerin (Fig.2 A). Expression of osteoprotegerin mRNA was time-dependent following attachment of cells to osteopontin (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether osteoprotegerin was secreted by these cells, we performed Western blot analysis on culture supernatants. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the level of osteoprotegerin protein in conditioned medium from cells plated in serum free medium on osteopontin for 20 h was much greater than that seen in medium from cells plated in the presence of zinc. In contrast, very little osteoprotegerin protein was observed in RAECΔN2 cells plated on PDL. Thus, osteoprotegerin appears to be secreted in response to osteopontin treatment in RAEC. Osteoprotegerin does not contain a transmembrane domain (17.Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.S. Luthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T. Shimamoto G. DeRose M.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1329-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar); however, it has been reported to be associated with the cell surface in some cell types (15.Yun T.J. Chaudhary P.M. Shu G.L. Frazer J.K. Ewings M.K. Schwartz S.M. Pascual V. Hood L.E. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6113-6121PubMed Google Scholar). We performed flow cytometry to examine if osteoprotegerin is associated with the cell surface. RAECΔN2 cells were plated on osteopontin and used for flow cytometry (Fig.2 D). The antiserum directed against osteoprotegerin showed a distinct increase in fluorescence compared with normal rabbit serum. Thus, at least some of the osteoprotegerin synthesized by endothelial cells may be associated with the surface of endothelial cells, possibly bound to some extracellular matrix protein expressed by RAECΔN2 cells. The expression pattern of osteoprotegerin suggested that it might mediate the NF-κB-dependent protective effects of αvβ3 ligation in endothelial cells. To examine this directly, we carried out cell survival studies with purified osteoprotegerin. As demonstrated previously, RAECΔN2 cells plated on osteopontin in the absence of ZnSO4 (active NF-κB) showed a low percentage of apoptotic nuclei. However, upon addition of 50 μm ZnSO4, NF-κB is inactivated, and serum deprivation now stimulates apoptosis (Fig.1 A). Addition of osteoprotegerin to the cell culture medium did not affect cells with active NF-κB but almost completely blocked apoptosis of cells with inactive NF-κB (Fig.3). Osteoprotegerin promoted a dose-dependent decrease in the percentage of apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 3), with half-maximal effects between 1 and 2 μg/ml osteoprotegerin. Addition of 5 μg/ml of exogenous osteoprotegerin decreased the level of apoptotic nuclei about 5-fold and almost to control levels. These data implicate osteoprotegerin as a potent survival factor for endothelial cells in response to serum deprivation. Osteoprotegerin is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. Osteoprotegerin contains a cysteine-rich amino-terminal domain, a putative death domain, and a COOH-terminal heparin-binding domain, but unlike other members of the TNF receptor family, does not contain a transmembrane domain. Therefore, it is thought to act as a soluble receptor (17.Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.S. Luthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L. Boone T. Shimamoto G. DeRose M.

Studies in mutant mice have validated the idea that osteoprotegerin is identical to the osteoblast-derived osteoclast inhibitory factor. Transgenic mice overexpressing osteoprotegerin exhibit increased bone density and increased mineralization due to a decrease in osteoclasts terminal differentiation (17.Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L.

Further studies have shown that osteoprotegerin inhibits osteoclastogenesis by binding osteoclast differentiation factor (RANKL/OPGL/TRANCE) and blocking its interaction with its receptor, RANK, on osteoclasts (TRANCE-R) (20.Yasuda H.

In addition, a role for osteoprotegerin in development of germinal centers in secondary lymphoid tissues has been postulated (15.Yun T.J. Chaudhary P.M. Shu G.L. Frazer J.K. Ewings M.K. Schwartz S.M. Pascual V. Hood L.E. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6113-6121PubMed Google Scholar). Most relevant to the present report, osteoprotegerin has also been implicated as a cell survival factor. Osteoprotegerin was found to interact with TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (18.Emery J.G. McDonnell P. Burke M.B. Deen K.C. Lyn S. Silverman C. Dul E. Appelbaum E.R. Eichman C. DiPrinzio R. Dodds R.A. James I.E. Rosenberg M. Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14363-14367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Osteoprotegerin was shown to bind to TRAIL with high affinity, and inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells (18.Emery J.G. McDonnell P. Burke M.B. Deen K.C. Lyn S. Silverman C. Dul E. Appelbaum E.R. Eichman C. DiPrinzio R. Dodds R.A. James I.E. Rosenberg M. Lee J.C. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14363-14367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Our studies further support a role for osteoprotegerin in cell survival. We have shown that osteoprotegerin protects endothelial cells from apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal and NF-κB inactivation. While the mechanism whereby osteoprotegerin protects endothelial cells is not yet clear, it is tempting to speculate that the effect of osteoprotegerin may be at the level of blocking a TRAIL or TRAIL-like death factor released under conditions of serum withdrawal. Our studies are the first to identify the expression and survival function of osteoprotegerin in endothelial cells. The fact that osteoprotegerin induction is dependent on αvβ3 ligation suggests that osteoprotegerin may be involved in endothelial cell morphogenesis. Recently, αvβ3 has been implicated in angiogenesis, and blockade of αvβ3 blocks capillary formation by inducing endothelial cell death (1.Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar). Alternatively, regulation by NF-κB suggests that osteoprotegerin may be involved in inflammatory functions of endothelial cells, since NF-κB activation by various stimuli leads to up-regulation of inflammatory mediators and leukocyte adhesion molecules. These possibilities are underscored by the phenotype of the osteoprotegerin null mice that, in addition to severe osteoporosis, showed extensive inflammation and calcification of aorta and renal artery (23.Bucay N. Sarosi I. Dunstan C.R. Morony S. Tarpley J. Capparelli C. Scully S. Tan H.L. Xu W. Lacey D.L. Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1260-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar). Combined with our findings, these studies implicate osteoprotegerin as a potential regulator of vascular homeostasis, in addition to bone remodeling."

https://openalex.org/W2053296976,"Although insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 and IGFBP-5 are known to modulate cell growth by reversibly sequestering extracellular insulin-like growth factors, several reports have suggested that IGFBP-3, and possibly also IGFBP-5, have important insulin-like growth factor-independent effects on cell growth. These effects may be related to the putative nuclear actions of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5, which we have recently shown are transported to the nuclei of T47D breast cancer cells. We now describe the mechanism for nuclear import of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5. In digitonin-permeabilized cells, where the nuclear envelope remained intact, nuclear translocation of wild-type IGFBP-3 appears to occur by a nuclear localization sequence (NLS)-dependent pathway mediated principally by the importin β nuclear transport factor and requiring both ATP and GTP hydrolysis. Under identical conditions, an NLS mutant form of IGFBP-3, IGFBP-3[228KGRKR → MDGEA], was unable to translocate to the nucleus. In cells where both the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope were permeabilized, wild-type IGFBP-3, but not the mutant form, accumulated in the nucleus, implying that the NLS was also involved in mediating binding to nuclear components. By fusing wild-type and mutant forms of NLS sequences (IGFBP-3 [215–232] and IGFBP-5 [201–218]) to the green fluorescent protein, we identified the critical residues of the NLS necessary and sufficient for nuclear accumulation. Using a Western ligand binding assay, wild-type IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5, but not an NLS mutant form of IGFBP-3, were shown to be recognized by importin β and the α/β heterodimer but only poorly by importin α. Together these results suggest that the NLSs within the C-terminal domain of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 are required for importin-β-dependent nuclear uptake and probably also accumulation through mediating binding to nuclear components.

Following their secretion into the extracellular environment, the IGFBPs inhibit or stimulate cell growth by regulating access of the extracellular IGFs to the type I IGF receptor (1De Mellow J.S. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). However, some IGFBPs, including IGFBP-3, also have effects on cell growth that are type I receptor-independent (2Cohen P. Lamson G. Okajima T. Rosenfeld R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 3Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol.

Expression of recombinant human IGFBP-3, for example, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of murine fibroblasts with a targeted disruption to the type I receptor (4Valentinis B. Bhala A. DeAngelis T. Baserga R. Cohen P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 361-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This growth inhibitory effect was directly related to the induction of apoptosis by IGFBP-3 (5Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of potent growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing agents such as transforming growth factor β1, retinoic acid, tumor necrosis factor-α, and anti-estrogens also induce IGFBP-3 gene expression (6Martin J.L. Ballesteros M. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 1703-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Martin J.L. Coverley J.A. Pattison S.T. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects on cell growth may be mediated by IGFBP-3 in an IGF-independent manner. There are fewer reports of IGF-independent effects of IGFBP-5; these include its ability to stimulate bone cell growth in the absence of increased IGF-I binding to its receptor (8Mohan S. Nakao Y. Honda Y. Landale E. Leser U. Dony C. Lang K. Baylink D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20424-20431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) for the IGF-independent effects of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 are currently unknown but may involve a direct nuclear action.Although some proteins appear to be constitutively nuclear, others enter the nucleus only under defined conditions (9Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Thus, cells are able to control the activity of nuclear proteins by regulating their nuclear uptake during differentiation and changes in the metabolic state of the cell. The central pore of the nuclear pore complex allows molecules up to 45 kDa to move freely between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (10Dingwall C. Laskey R. Science. 1992; 258: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For proteins larger than 45 kDa, nuclear transport is generally an active, nuclear localization sequence (NLS)-dependent process that requires specific targeting sequences contained within the primary sequence of the transported protein or a cotransported protein (11Miller M. Park M.K. Hanover J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 909-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).The cell contains multiple signal-dependent pathways for nuclear transport, of which the best characterized requires the cytosolic receptors, importin α and β (12Gorlich D.

Conventionally, the importin α subunit acts as an adapter, binding to the NLS of cytosolic proteins as well as to importin β, which together with Ran effects translocation through the nuclear pore complex.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This basic domain is highly conserved in IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 from different species, suggesting that it has functional significance. Similar basic sequences have been identified in a number of other secreted proteins and shown to be important for their respective signaling roles. These include platelet-derived growth factor A (30Bejcek B.E. Li D.Y. Deuel T.F. Science. 1989; 245: 1496-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), acidic fibroblast growth factor (31Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D. Jackson A. Maier J.A. Hla T.

We report that previously identified NLS-like sequences within IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 are necessary and sufficient for their nuclear accumulation. IGFBP-3 nuclear import is an energy-dependent process requiring ATP and GTP hydrolysis and mediated by importin β. In addition, IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 are both recognized specifically by importin β and the importin α/β heterodimer but not by importin α. Thus, nuclear import of IGFBP-3, and by analogy IGFBP-5, appears to occur by a signal-dependent importin β-mediated pathway. In addition, we show that, possibly mediated by its NLS, IGFBP-3 is capable of interaction with nuclear binding sites, which may play an important role in its nuclear accumulation.DISCUSSIONThis study identifies an 18-amino acid region of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 that is necessary and sufficient for nuclear transport and accumulation. Our results suggest that nuclear import of IGFBP-3, and probably by analogy IGFBP-5, is an energy-dependent process mediated by importin β and following nuclear entry, IGFBP-3 can actively accumulate through binding to detergent-insoluble nuclear components. Mutation of the basic regions within the C-terminal domain of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 attenuates nuclear import and/or accumulation and, as shown for IGFBP-3, reduces importin binding.We have studied nuclear transport of IGFBP-3 using an in vitro nuclear transport assay that allows the role of individual components of the transport system to be examined. As a control, we examined the nuclear uptake of β-galactosidase fused to the N1N2 bipartite NLS (46Hu W. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15820-15827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the presence of cytosolic factors and an ATP-regeneration system, full-length wild-type IGFBP-3 was capable of nuclear uptake in all cells where the plasma membrane had been permeabilized, but the nuclear envelope remained intact. Previous studies in intact cells have shown that nuclear transport of IGFBP-3 is detected only in a low percentage of cells in the monolayer (33Jaques G. Noll K. Wegmann B. Witten S. Kogan E. Radulescu R.T. Havemann K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1767-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 34Li W. Fawcett J. Widmer H.R. Fielder P.J. Rabkin R. Keller G.A.

Dermatol. 1998; 111: 239-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, these data suggest that the plasma membrane is an important regulator of nuclear uptake of IGFBP-3 and consequently also of its subsequent function in the nucleus.Nuclear protein import directed by bipartite NLSs conventionally requires cytosolic factors such as importin α/β, Ran, and nuclear transport factor 2 (44Yoneda Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, we show here that nuclear transport of IGFBP-3 can occur efficiently in the absence of added soluble transport factors. Analogous observations have been reported for nuclear transport conferred by the HIV-I Tat NLS (26Efthymiadis A. Briggs L.J. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1623-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K sequence KNS (28Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The Wnt signal transduction pathway component β-catenin (27Fagotto F. Gluck U. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which appears to be able to bind directly to nucleoporins, similarly appears not to require soluble factors for nuclear import; interestingly, nuclear transport of β-catenin appears to occur through a Ran-independent pathway (51Yokoya F. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, unlike IGFBP-3, the targeting signals of Tat and hnRNP K represent novel nuclear targeting signals not resembling the T-ag or bipartite NLSs and, furthermore, do not appear to be recognized by importin α/β. Previous studies have found that sufficient importin β, but not importin α, may remain associated with the nuclear pore complex to support a basal level of nuclear import subsequent to digitonin permeabilization (12Gorlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 47Chi N.C. Adam E.J. Adam S.A. J.

Cell. 1994; 79: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Therefore, nuclear import in the absence of added cytosol suggests that the adapter, importin α, is not required for nuclear transport but does not rule out the possibility that importin β alone is mediating uptake. Our findings that inclusion of an antibody specific to importin β, both in the presence and absence of added cytosol, inhibited nuclear import of IGFBP-3, suggests that importin β, but not importin α, is required to sustain basal nuclear import. Similarly, addition of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTPγS, to the transport assay significantly reduced nuclear import of IGFBP-3. Together these results suggest that both importin β alone, and GTP hydrolysis are required for efficient transport. Importin β appears to be the sole nuclear targeting signal receptor used by parathyroid hormone-related protein (24Lam M.H. Briggs L.J. Hu W. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7391-7398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (25Tiganis T. Flint A.J. Adam S.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol.

Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1204-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that the cytosolic-independent nature of IGFBP-3 nuclear import is effected by other factors that, like importin β, may not be completely solubilized during digitonin permeabilization.Nuclear import mediated by conventional NLSs such as those found in T-ag and retinoblastoma (42Efthymiadis A. Shao H. Hubner S. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22134-22139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), as well as by novel NLSs of HIV-I Tat (26Efthymiadis A. Briggs L.J. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1623-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and the hnRNP K (28Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and hnRNP A1 M9 sequences (52Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), has been shown to be ATP-dependent; cytosolic factor-independent nuclear import of β-catenin has also been shown to require ATP (27Fagotto F. Gluck U. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of HIV-I Tat, ATP hydrolysis is believed to effect its release from cytoplasmic retention factors and enhance binding to nuclear components. Because nuclear import of IGFBP-3 was not observed in the absence of an ATP-regenerating system, IGFBP-3 may also require ATP for cytoplasmic release and/or enhanced nuclear binding. Alternatively, as is the case for many proteins transported to the nucleus, ATP may be involved in other, unknown actions that augment nuclear uptake.In the presence of a permeabilized nuclear envelope, proteins are free to diffuse between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments and are only able to accumulate in the nucleus through binding to insoluble nuclear components such as chromatin and lamin (42Efthymiadis A. Shao H. Hubner S. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22134-22139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Under conditions where the nuclear envelope was permeabilized, IGFBP-3, but not the mutant, IGFBP-3[228KGRKR → MDGEA], was capable of nuclear accumulation. These results support the proposal that, upon entry into the nucleus, IGFBP-3 accumulates through nuclear binding and suggest that residues 228–232 are required for these nuclear interactions. The ability of IGFBP-3 to bind to structures within the nucleus supports the hypothesis that it may have a role in the nucleus, possibly in direct regulation of gene transcription (33Jaques G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7391-7398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which can also accumulate in the nucleus even in the absence of an intact nuclear envelope.Fusion of EGFP to isolated motifs has been used to study changes in subcellular distribution directed by these sequences (50Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we investigated the role of the basic motifs of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 in their nuclear transport. As the fusion proteins are expressed in living CHO cells, the proteins, factors and metabolic pathways present and active in living cells are able to exert their effects on nuclear transport, thus representing an in vivonuclear transport assay. EGFP is small enough to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion, and as expected, the fluorescent signal derived from recombinant EGFP expressed in CHO cells was evenly distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Fusion of the basic region within the C-terminal domain of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 to EGFP caused nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein in greater than 90% of transfected cells, indicating that the basic regions are sufficient for nuclear import. However, these results do not distinguish between active nuclear transport and nuclear binding. Thus, there may be passive diffusion into the nucleus followed by accumulation resulting from interaction between these basic sequences and nuclear binding sites, as well as interaction of the basic residues with importins, leading to active nuclear import.Mutation of the three basic clusters within the putative NLS of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 caused different degrees of attenuation of nuclear transport of the EGFP fusion proteins. As was observed for the mutant form of full-length IGFBP-3, 228KGRKR → MDGEA, the same mutation of both the IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 NLS when fused to EGFP, abolished nuclear uptake of EGFP. Mutation of both amino acids within the N-terminal basic cluster had a significant effect on nuclear transport of the EGFP fusion proteins, suggesting that the basic region may represent a classical bipartite NLS similar to that described for other proteins (9Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 21Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). However, mutation of the central basic cluster reduced nuclear transport of the fusion proteins by approximately 60%, implying that these basic clusters also influence nuclear accumulation and that the NLS is more complex than a classical bipartite NLS. As discussed above, the ability of the fusion protein to diffuse freely into the nucleus means that a distinction cannot be drawn between enhancement of nuclear import and accumulation because of nuclear binding. Therefore, mutations affecting nuclear transport may relate to either or both effects. However, in vitro studies on the mutant, IGFBP-3[228KGRKR → MDGEA], suggest these sequences are involved in both effects. In this assay the basic sequences derived from IGFBP-5 behaved identically to those derived from IGFBP-3, suggesting that IGFBP-5, which is small enough to diffusion through the nuclear pore complex (molecular mass, 30 kDa), accumulates in the nucleus by a similar mechanism.We found that the importin β subunit recognized both wild-type IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 but recognized only to a limited extent the mutant form of IGFBP-3. This suggests that transport of these binding proteins occurs by a signal-mediated pathway, consistent with the observation that importin β is required to effect in vitro nuclear transport of IGFBP-3. Interestingly, all the importin α/β binding to IGFBP-5 could be accounted for by importin β binding, whereas for IGFBP-3 importin β binding appeared significantly lower compared with its binding to the heterodimer. This was not compensated for by an appropriate increase in importin α binding. The explanation for this is unclear but may relate to differing affinities or accessibility of the binding proteins for the importin subunits. Alternatively, importin α may be binding to importin β in this assay and increasing the strength of its interactions with IGFBP-3. However, an essential role for importin α in IGFBP-3 nuclear transport is not supported by our findings that nuclear import occurs in the absence of exogenous cytosol.An interesting question raised by this study is why IGFBP-5, and to a lesser extent IGFBP-3, possess functional NLSs when, because of their size, they have the potential to diffuse from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. There are several reasons why smaller proteins possess NLS-dependent mechanisms for nuclear import. As has been described for interleukin-5 (55Jans D.A. Briggs L.J. Gustin S.E. Jans P. Ford S. Young I.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a functional NLS enables the cotransport of larger non-NLS containing proteins to the nucleus. In analogous fashion, IGFBP-3 or IGFBP-5 may possess functional NLSs to facilitate entry when part of a high molecular mass complex. Thus, they may require an NLS-dependent mechanism when cotransporting IGFs or other signaling molecules to the nucleus. Interestingly, a preliminary report suggests that IGFBP-3 interacts specifically with the retinoic acid X receptor-α (56Cohen P. Liu B. Ferry R. Jansen-Duerr P. Mannhardt B. Clifford J. Lee H. Kurie J. Growth Hormone IGF Res. 1999; 9: 317Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 may thereby modulate the activity of nuclear transcription factors or have a specific signal transduction role in the nucleus. It may also regulate gene expression directly by binding to chromatin as has been reported for basic fibroblast growth factor (57Gualandris A. Coltrini D. Bergonzoni L. Isacchi A. Tenca S. Ginelli B. Presta M. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the growth hormone receptor (58Lobie P.E. Wood T.J. Chen C.M. Waters M.J. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31735-31746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the selective use of an NLS-dependent mechanism for the transport of high molecular mass complexes, the kinetics of nuclear import of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 may be enhanced by their ability to interact effectively with importin. A major focus of future work in this laboratory is to distinguish between these possibilities. Understanding of the mechanisms of nuclear import of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-5 should greatly assist in defining their nuclear functions. The mitogenic"

Using the human promonocytic THP-1 cell line, we demonstrated that the endogenous IRAK is quickly activated in response to bacterial LPS stimulation, as measured by its in vitro kinase activity toward myelin basic protein. LPS also triggers the association of IRAK with MyD88, the adaptor protein linking IRAK to the Toll-like receptor/interleukin-1β receptor intracellular domain. Macrophage cells with prolonged LPS treatment become tolerant to additional dose of LPS and no longer express inflammatory cytokines. Endotoxin tolerance is a common phenomenon observed in blood from sepsis patients. We observed for the first time that the quantity of IRAK is greatly reduced in LPS-tolerant THP-1 cells, and its activity no longer responds to further LPS challenge. In addition, IRAK does not associate with MyD88 in the tolerant cells. Furthermore, application of AG126, a putative tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can substantially alleviate the LPS-induced cytokine gene expression and can also decrease IRAK level and activity. Our study indicates that IRAK is essential for LPS-mediated signaling and that cells may develop endotoxin tolerance by down-regulating IRAK.

Grodzin C.J. Balk R.A. Chest. 1997; 112: 235-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). Although appropriate amounts of these mediators may be essential for augmenting microcidal activities of macrophages, excessive production caused by acute bacterial infection during sepsis results in severe systematic inflammatory complications (2Bone R.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1996; 276: 565-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps developed as a self-protective adaptive response, human neutrophils and monocytes isolated from sepsis patients become refractory to further LPS challenge and no longer produce inflammatory cytokines (3McCall C.E. Grosso-Wilmoth L.M. LaRue K. Guzman R.N. Cousart S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This phenomenon, referred to as endotoxin tolerance, has also been demonstrated in animal models of endotoxemia (4Beeson P.B. J. Exp. Med. 1947; 86: 29-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and can be induced in a variety of primary monocyte/macrophage cells and cell lines. Upon LPS treatment, the human promonocytic THP-1 cells mimic all the responses exhibited by human whole blood and blood neutrophils from sepsis patients (5LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Both human leukocytes obtained from sepsis patients, and the THP-1 cells treated with LPS show an adaptation of innate immune response as reflected by the suppression of steady-state mRNAs of proinflammatory genes (5LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism underlying endotoxin tolerance is not known. Recently, a family of Toll-like transmembrane receptor (TLR) proteins were identified in humans and mice that respond to LPS and other microbial products, thereby modulating the innate immune response (6Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The TLR proteins possess leucine-rich extracellular repeats that may recognize the LPS-lipid-binding protein-CD14 complex (7Poltorak A. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Citterio S. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2163-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the TLR proteins possess intracellular domains resembling the IL-1β receptor-like intracellular domain and may utilize IL-1β signaling components including adaptor protein MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), and TNF receptor-activated factor 6 (TRAF6) (6Medzhitov R.

Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). IRAK subsequently undergoes phosphorylation and relays the signal downstream by interacting with TRAF6 (9Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X.

Overexpression of a dominant negative IRAK in human THP-1 cells inhibits the LPS-induced NFkB activation (6Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol.

Furthermore, overexpression of wild type IRAK in an IRAK-deficient 293 cell line renders the cell responsive to LPS stimulation as measured by NFkB promoter reporter assay (12Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). However, there has been no study regarding the endogenous IRAK response upon LPS stimulation. The inability of cells to express inflammatory genes in response to LPS in endotoxin-tolerant cells reflects a state of altered innate immunity. Disruption of the molecular signaling events linking from LPS stimulation to inflammatory gene activation could contribute to the altered innate immune response. C3H/HeJ mice, which have defects in the gene encoding the TLR4 protein, are unresponsive to LPS stimulation (13Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6421) Google Scholar, 14Qureshi S.T. Gros P. Malo D.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MyD88 knock-out mice are also unable to induce LPS-dependent gene expression (16Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). In addition, both the C3H/HeJ and MyD88 knock-out mice exhibit high resistance to LPS-induced shock. However, it is not known what molecular alterations are responsible for the development of endotoxin tolerance in wild type human macrophage. Examination of the molecular alteration(s) in endotoxin-tolerant cells may shed light on the mechanism of the innate adaptation developed in human septic blood cells. In this study, we examined the endogenous IRAK protein level and kinase activity in fresh and endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells. We observed that endogenous IRAK in fresh THP-1 cells is activated upon LPS stimulation. In contrast, IRAK level is consistently low in endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells and is no longer responsive to further LPS treatment. Furthermore, IRAK interacts with MyD88 upon LPS treatment, whereas such interaction is abolished in tolerant cells. Application of AG126, a putative kinase inhibitor, causes IRAK level decrease and inactivation and also decreases the cellular IL-1β expression upon LPS treatment. Our results suggest that defective IRAK may be responsible for the development of endotoxin tolerance during sepsis. LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4) was obtained from Sigma. AG-126 was purchased from Biomol. IRAK antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. MyD88 and TRAF6 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. We employed the undifferentiated human promonocytic THP-1 cells for our study. The advantages of that are 2-fold. First, our lab has previously completed extensive studies characterizing the tolerant phenotype of THP-1 cells (5LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is similar to the tolerant phenotype seen in leukocytes from humans with sepsis. Second, undifferentiated THP-1 cells do not express IL-1 type I receptor and therefore do not respond to IL-1 stimulation (17Spriggs M.K. Lioubin P.J. Slack J. Dower S.K. Jonas U. Cosman D. Sims J.E. Bauer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IRAK response we observed is solely due to LPS stimulation rather than IL-1 effect. We have found that the model of LPS tolerance in undifferentiated THP-1 cells is similar to that of vitamin D3 differentiated THP-1 cells (5LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 2L. Li, S. Cousart, J. Hu, and C. E. McCall, unpublished observations. The LPS responses of both undifferentiated and differentiated THP-1 cells are CD14-dependent. Endotoxin tolerance in undifferentiated THP-1 cells can be induced by treating the cells with LPS ranging from 10 ng/ml to 1 μg/ml (5LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). THP-1 cells are rendered tolerant within 6 h of LPS treatment and remain tolerant up to 96 h after the initial dose of LPS (5LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In our hands, intracellular events modulating LPS tolerance are optimally studied using higher concentrations of LPS and stimulating the cells with a second dose of LPS at 12–24 h after the initial dose of LPS. In this investigation, undifferentiated THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Tolerant THP-1 cells were obtained by treating the cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) with 500 ng/ml endotoxin (E. coli0111:B4; Sigma) for 16 h (5LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fresh as well as endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells were washed with serum free RPMI medium, resuspended in fresh culture medium at a final concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml, and treated with 500 ng/ml endotoxin for various times as indicated in the figure legends. Total RNA was isolated using the RNazol B method (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Routinely, 5 × 106 THP-1 cells/condition were used. Total RNA (10 mg/lane) was fractionated on a 1% agarose, 6.6% formaldehyde gel in 1× MOPS buffer (0.02 m MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA), and capillary blotted onto nylon membrane filters. UV cross-linking was performed using a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Northern analysis was performed as described (5LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 normal and endotoxin-tolerant cells were collected at each time point, pelleted at 1000 ×g for 10 min, and lysed on ice for 10 min in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm para-nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Extracts with equal amount of proteins were used for the immunoprecipitation. 5 μl of polyclonal anti-IRAK antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to 800 μl each of the isolated cell extracts and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h on a rotator. 50 μl of a 50% slurry of prewashed protein G-agarose beads were then added to each sample, followed by incubation for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were spun briefly in a microcentrifuge and washed four times in lysis buffer. Each sample was divided into two equal portions. One portion of each sample was solubilized by SDS sample buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.2 mdithiothreitol), separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), Western blotted with anti-IRAK antibody, and detected with ECL. The other portion of samples were washed twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm para-nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmbenzamidine). 50 μl of kinase buffer was then added to each sample, supplemented with 5 μm ATP, 1 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma), 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. SDS sample buffer was added after incubation, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. The intensity of the radioactive signal was quantified using a PhosphorImager plate (Molecular Dynamics). Human promonocytic THP-1 cells produce inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β in response to LPS challenge. THP-1 cells pretreated with LPS are tolerant to additional dose of LPS. As shown in Fig. 1, RNAs from THP-1 cells after 3 h of LPS treatment were extracted and analyzed for expression of TNFα and IL-1β by Northern blotting. In response to LPS, fresh THP-1 cells express IL-1β and TNFα mRNAs. However, pretreatment with LPS greatly decreases the IL-lβ and TNFα expression upon second dose of LPS treatment (Fig. 1). Genetic analyses indicate that TLRs mediate the LPS response by utilizing the IL-1β signaling components MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6. IRAK exists as two forms, hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated, migrating around 100 and 80 kDa, respectively, on a SDS-PAGE gel (9Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Within 10 min of IL-1β stimulation, IRAK undergoes phosphorylation, activation, and almost complete degradation (9Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 10Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although the response of IRAK upon IL-1β stimulation has been studied extensively, there has been no detailed study regarding the endogenous IRAK upon LPS treatment. To understand the LPS-TLR-mediated signaling in THP-1 cells, we examined the endogenous IRAK response to LPS stimulation in fresh THP-1 cells. Fresh undifferentiated THP-1 cells were subjected to LPS treatment for various amount of time. IRAK protein was subsequently immunoprecipitated and subjected to Western analysis. In contrast to its IL-1β response, where the level of IRAK rapidly decreases as a result of protein degradation, there is no appreciable loss of IRAK within the first 20 min of LPS stimulation (Fig.2 A). However, the ratio of upper IRAK form increases after 5 min of LPS treatment, suggesting that endogenous IRAK undergoes rapid phosphorylation upon LPS stimulation. After 60–90 min of LPS stimulation, IRAK levels markedly decrease and remain at a low level. We performed four independent experiments and obtained consistent results. Next, we analyzed the IRAK kinase activity using in vitrokinase assay against artificial substrate MBP. As shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), IRAK exhibits a gradual, yet marked elevation in its kinase activity within 1 h of LPS stimulation of normal THP-1 cells, in contrast to the reported abrupt IRAK activation caused by IL-1β (9Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 10Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). IRAK kinase activity decreases to basal level after 90 min of LPS treatment, coinciding with the decrease in IRAK level. Because undifferentiated THP-1 cells do not express IL-1 type 1 receptor (17Spriggs M.K. Lioubin P.J. Slack J. Dower S.K. Jonas U. Cosman D. Sims J.E. Bauer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and do not respond to IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 3 A) (17Spriggs M.K. Lioubin P.J. Slack J. Dower S.K. Jonas U. Cosman D. Sims J.E. Bauer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Inoue M. Fujii H. Kaseyama H. Yamashina I. Nakada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we conclude that the observed IRAK response is caused directly by LPS rather than by the subsequent IL-1 production. Control experiments where THP-1 cells treated with recombinant IL-1β showed that IRAK protein levels and kinase activities are not affected (Fig. 3,B and C). Furthermore, IL-1β pretreated THP-1 cells can still respond to LPS stimulation, as measured by IL-1β message induction and IRAK kinase activation (Fig. 3, B and C). Consistent with previous genetic analysis, our observation provides biochemical evidence indicating that LPS signals through endogenous IRAK in normal human monocyte-like cells. Our results also indicate that LPS induces a distinct IRAK response compared with IL-1β. IL-1β causes rapid IRAK phosphorylation/activation and degradation (10Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 19Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), whereas LPS causes a gradual activation of IRAK. We then examined the IRAK protein and its kinase activity in the endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cells. IRAK was immunoprecipitated from tolerant THP-1 cells and analyzed by Western blot. Strikingly, IRAK protein level is low but constant in the tolerant cells. In addition, the ratio of hyperphosphorylated versus hypophosphorylated IRAK remains unchanged upon second dose of LPS treatment (Fig.4 A). We also noticed that the residue hypophosphorylated IRAK runs as a doublet on the gel, and this pattern persists upon second dose of LPS treatment. The cause of the doublet is unknown. Furthermore, although IRAK protein level in tolerant cells persists at ∼20% compared with the level in normal cells, no IRAK kinase activation is observed in the tolerant THP-1 cells upon second dose of LPS treatment (Fig. 4 B). We performed four independent experiments and obtained consistent results. Our results indicate that there is a disruption of IRAK response in tolerant cells. More interestingly, It was shown that THP-1 cells develop endotoxin tolerance as early as 2–3 h after LPS treatment (5LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), coinciding with our observation that IRAK level and activity decrease in normal THP-1 cells after 90 min of LPS stimulation. The tolerant THP-1 cells remain tolerant even 9 h after the removal of LPS (5LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Examination of IRAK showed that, 9 h after removal of LPS by washing the cells with endotoxin-free medium, the endotoxin-tolerant cells still maintain a low level of IRAK protein and low kinase activity (data not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that the inability of tolerant cells to express inflammatory cytokine is at least in part contributed by the disruption of IRAK. MyD88 is the adaptor molecule that links both TLR and IL-1 receptor intracellular domain with IRAK (6Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). IRAK then relays the signal to TRAF6 and subsequently activates downstream kinases and transcription factors (20Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). We next examined the interaction of endogenous IRAK with MyD88 and TRAF6 in normal as well as tolerant THP-1 cells. Upon LPS stimulation, MyD88 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed through SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Unlike IRAK, we observed that there is a steady level of MyD88 protein in both the normal and tolerant cells (Fig.5 A). Upon reprobing the blot with anti-IRAK antibody, we found that IRAK forms an immunocomplex with MyD88 after 5 min of LPS stimulation (Fig. 5 A). Such interaction persists about 1 h and disappears afterward. Strikingly, we could not detect any association of IRAK with MyD88 in the tolerant THP-1 cells (Fig. 5 A). To examine the IRAK-TRAF6 interaction, TRAF6 protein was similarly immunoprecipitated using anti-TRAF6 antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Like MyD88, we observed that TRAF6 is also a constitutively expressed protein with a steady level in both normal and tolerant cells (Fig. 5 B). Upon reprobing the membrane with anti-IRAK antibody, we can only detect the upper phosphorylated form of IRAK (Fig. 5 B). This is in consistent with the previous observation that IL-1β-activated IRAK undergoes phosphorylation and subsequent association with TRAF6 protein. Interestingly, the amount of phosphorylated IRAK that co-immunoprecipitated with TRAF6 remains constant in normal and tolerant THP-1 cells. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that TRAF6-bound IRAK may undergo turnover during LPS stimulation in normal and tolerant cells. It has been reported that administration of tyrphostin AG126, a putative tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can decrease the IL-1β and TNFα production in mice macrophages upon subsequent LPS stimulation (21Novogrodsky A. Vanichkin A. Patya M. Gazit A. Osherov N. Levitzki A. Science. 1994; 264: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). AG-126 can also protect the mice from LPS-induced septic shock (21Novogrodsky A. Vanichkin A. Patya M. Gazit A. Osherov N. Levitzki A. Science. 1994; 264: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Because TLR-MyD88-IRAK-mediated signaling is critical for cellular LPS response, we examined whether AG-126 can interfere with this signaling process. Consistent with the previous report, we find that pretreating the THP-1 cells with AG126 for 1 h can dramatically decrease the IL-1β production upon subsequent LPS stimulation (Fig. 6 A). We next examined the effect of AG126 on IRAK protein level and kinase activity. Interestingly, treatment of THP-1 cells with AG126 for 1 h consistently causes a dramatic decrease in the IRAK protein level (Fig.6 B). In addition, there is no induction of IRAK kinase activity upon subsequent LPS treatment (Fig. 6 B). The correlation between IRAK level as well as activity decrease and subsequent inhibition of LPS-induced cytokine gene expression further indicates that disruption of TLR-mediated signaling at the point of IRAK contributes to endotoxin tolerance (Fig.7).Figure 7A model of the role of IRAK in LPS-TLR-mediated signaling in normal and tolerant cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because IRAK is a putative serine/threonine kinase, it is unlikely that AG-126 directly inhibits IRAK activation. AG126 may actually target some other kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) that in turn cause IRAK level decrease and inactivation. Further biochemical analysis of IRAK phosphorylation site(s) and identification of other critical modifying enzymes of IRAK will provide insight into the regulation of IRAK function during TLR-mediated signaling pathway in normal and tolerant cells. Genetic analyses indicate that LPS signaling utilizes Toll-like-receptors and shares IL-1 signaling components, namely MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6 (6Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Using the undifferentiated human promonocytic THP-1 cells, which do not respond to IL-1 stimulation, we provided biochemical evidence confirming that LPS stimulation leads to the activation of endogenous IRAK kinase and its subsequent interaction with MyD88. Our study showed that LPS induces a distinct IRAK response compared with IL-1β. Previous studies using IL-1 responsive cell lines (such as MRC-5 fibroblast cells) showed that IL-1β causes rapid IRAK phosphorylation/activation and degradation (10Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 19Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). In this report, we observed that LPS causes a gradual IRAK activation and no apparent decrease in IRAK level within the first 20 min of LPS stimulation (10Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported that the association of MyD88 and IRAK occurs within 5 min after IL-1β stimulation and quickly dissociates within 20 min of IL-1β treatment (19Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that LPS-induced MyD88-IRAK interaction persists until 1 h after LPS stimulation. Undifferentiated THP-1 cells express relatively low levels of CD14 and are therefore less responsive to LPS. The delayed IRAK response we observed might be caused by its low surface CD14 level. It might also result from unique phosphorylation/modification events incurred on IRAK by LPS/TLR-mediated signaling. So far, however, there is no study regarding the phosphorylation/modification status of IRAK. Further examination of the phosphorylation status of IRAK upon LPS and IL-1β stimulation will provide clues regarding the delicate regulation of IRAK activity and its involvement in these two distinct yet related signaling pathways. Gene disruption(s) of the TLR-mediated signaling components can lead to endotoxin tolerance. C3H/HeJ mice, which carry a point mutation in TLR4 gene, are unresponsive to LPS stimulation (13Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6421) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice with MyD88 gene deletion also fail to respond to LPS challenge (16Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). However, it is not known how wild type human monocytes and promonocytic cell lines acquire endotoxin tolerance upon pretreatment with LPS. Our study indicates that tolerant THP-1 cells maintain normal levels of MyD88 as well as TRAF6 proteins. Strikingly, IRAK protein level is only ∼20% compared with that in normal THP-1 cells. Furthermore, additional LPS challenge no longer induces IRAK kinase activity increase in tolerant cells. We also showed that IRAK no longer associates with MyD88 in the tolerant cells upon further LPS stimulation. These results indicate that among the LPS-TLR-mediated proximal signaling components MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6, only alterations in IRAK coincide with THP-1 cells acquiring endotoxin tolerance. Three further observations support the role of IRAK disruption in cells acquiring endotoxin tolerance. First, THP-1 cells develop endotoxin tolerance as early as 2–3 h after LPS treatment (5LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), coinciding with our observation that IRAK level and activity are decreased in normal THP-1 cells after 1–1.5 h of LPS stimulation. Second, the tolerant THP-1 cells remain tolerant even 9 h after the removal of LPS (5LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Examination of IRAK showed that the endotoxin-tolerant cells still maintain low level of IRAK protein and low kinase activity 9 h after removal of LPS. Third, application of AG-126, a putative tyrosine kinase inhibitor, can protect animals against LPS lethality. Examination of IRAK showed that AG126 causes dramatic decrease in IRAK signal and also prevents IRAK kinase activation upon subsequent LPS treatment. Taken together, we suggest that the inability of tolerant cells to express inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS may be partly contributed by the disruption of IRAK (Fig. 7). The exact role IRAK kinase activation plays in LPS-TLR-mediated signaling is not clear. It has been reported that during IL-1-induced signaling IRAK kinase activity may not be essential (22Knop J. Martin M.U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). By overexpressing a kinase-dead IRAK mutant in HEK293 cells, it was shown that mutant IRAK could still activate NFκB (23Maschera B. Ray K. Burns K. Volpe F. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has been therefore suggested that IRAK might serve as an essential adaptor protein during IL-1-mediated signaling. The kinase activity of IRAK may actually facilitate its own degradation and subsequent down-regulation of IL-1 signaling (10Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The decrease in IRAK level after 1–3 h of LPS stimulation observed in this study may also be caused by a similar effect. IRAK may not be the only component that is disrupted and responsible for acquiring endotoxin tolerance. There are two other IRAK-related kinases, namely IRAK-2 and IRAK-M. Although their physiological functions are still unknown, overexpression of either of these two kinases can reconstitute the IL-1 and LPS response in a 293 mutant cell line lacking IRAK (12Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In agreement with the above study, transgenic mice with IRAK gene deletion was shown to still retain some response to IL-1, although with a drastic decrease (24Thomas J.A. Allen J.L. Tsen M. Dubnicoff T. Danao J. Liao X.C. Cao Z. Wasserman S.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 978-984PubMed Google Scholar). Those studies suggest that either IRAK-2 or IRAK-M may play some compensatory roles in IL-1- and/or LPS-mediated signaling. However, under physiological condition, it is also possible that certain endogenous form(s) can only respond specifically to certain stimulus (IL-1 or LPS). Because there are no antibodies available for IRAK-2 and IRAK-M, there has yet been no study regarding these endogenous proteins. Once the antibodies are available, it would be necessary to examine the exact roles of these related kinases in IL-1- and LPS-mediated signaling. It would be also interesting to study whether cells have to alter IRAK-2 and/or IRAK-M to acquire endotoxin tolerance. Disruption of components upstream of IRAK may also be needed and necessary for development of LPS tolerance. Recently, it was reported that the surface level of TLR4 receptor was reduced in LPS-tolerant murine macrophages (25Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kwai T. Matsumoto M. Miyake K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of TLR4 down-regulation is not known. Because there is no significant change in TLR4 message level between normal and tolerant cells (25Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kwai T. Matsumoto M. Miyake K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), receptor internalization and degradation might account for the decrease. Surprisingly, the mutated TLR4 receptor in macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice was also internalized upon LPS challenge (25Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kwai T. Matsumoto M. Miyake K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). This suggests that other LPS recognition events are necessary for TLR4 down-regulation and development of endotoxin tolerance. In addition, The TLR4 level gradually decreases upon LPS challenge and was dramatically reduced after 24 h of LPS pretreatment (25Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kwai T. Matsumoto M. Miyake K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The fact that endotoxin tolerance can be induced with a minimum of 2–3 h of LPS pretreatment suggests that LPS tolerance does not solely occur because of suppression of the surface TLR4. It would not be surprising to find out in the future that a series of changes including LPS receptors and intracellular components jointly contribute to the development of endotoxin tolerance. In summary, LPS stimulation of human promonocytic THP-1 cells leads to the activation of endogenous IRAK kinase and its interaction with MyD88. The decrease of IRAK level and its unresponsiveness to further LPS stimulation coincide with the THP-1 cells acquiring endotoxin tolerance. These data support the concepts that endogenous IRAK is involved in the LPS-TLR-mediated signaling and that disruption of IRAK is one mechanism by which cells may acquire endotoxin tolerance."

In an earlier step in the biosynthetic pathway to reticuline, anotherO-methyltransferase,S-adenosyl-l-methionine:norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase (6-OMT), catalyzes methylation of the 6-hydroxyl group of norcoclaurine. We isolated two kinds of cDNA clones that correspond to the internal amino acid sequences of a 6-OMT/4′-OMT preparation from cultured Coptis japonicacells. Heterologously expressed proteins had 6-OMT or 4′-OMT activities, indicative that each cDNA encodes a different enzyme. 4′-OMT was purified using recombinant protein, and its enzymological properties were characterized. It had enzymological characteristics similar to those of 6-OMT; the active enzyme was the dimer of the subunit, no divalent cations were required for activity, and there was inhibition by Fe2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Zn2+, or Ni2+, but none by the SH reagent. 4′-OMT clearly had different substrate specificity. It methylated (R,S)-6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline, as well as (R,S)-laudanosoline and (R,S)-norlaudanosoline. Laudanosoline, anN-methylated substrate, was a much better substrate for 4′-OMT than norlaudanosoline. 6-OMT methylated norlaudanosoline and laudanosoline equally. Further characterization of the substrate saturation and product inhibition kinetics indicated that 4′-OMT follows an ordered Bi Bi mechanism, whereas 6-OMT follows a Ping-Pong Bi Bi mechanism.

The biosynthetic pathway to reticuline has been clarified, and nine enzymes that are involved in stepwise conversion of two molecules of the primary metabolite l-tyrosine to one molecule of reticuline have been identified (Fig. 1) (Ref. 1Stadler R. Zenk M.H. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1990; 6: 555-562Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholarand references therein). Of the nine steps, three are methyl transfer reactions on the OH or NH group that are catalyzed by S-adenosyl-l-methionine:norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase (6-OMT)1 (2Ruffer M. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1983; 49: 131-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Müller M.J. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1992; 58: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Sato F. Tsujita T. Katagiri Y.

Naturforsch. 1986; 41c: 126-134Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Frenzel T. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3491-3497Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Methyltransferases are essential for directing intermediates to specific biosynthetic pathways (8Poulton J.E. Conn E.E. The Biochemistry of Plants. 7. Academic Press, New York1981: 667-723Google Scholar). 6-OMT catalyzes the transfer of the S-methyl group of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to the 6-hydroxyl group of norcoclaurine to form coclaurine. This is the firstO-methylation step in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. NMT catalyzes the N-methylation of coclaurine to form N-methylcoclaurine, and 4′-OMT transfers the methyl group to the 4′-hydroxyl group of 3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine to form reticuline. In addition S-adenosyl-l-methionine:scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase (SMT) (9Muemmler S. Ruffer M. Zenk M.H. Plant Cell Rep. 1985; 4: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Sato F.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 29-36PubMed Google Scholar) catalyzes the crucial step in the conversion of scoulerine, which is derived from reticuline, to tetrahydrocolumbamine in the berberine biosynthetic pathway (Fig.1). Each O-methyltransferase (OMT) in the biosynthesis of reticuline or berberine has strict substrate specificity, despite structural similarities of the various substrates. Because of their importance for the production of these pharmaceutically important alkaloids and their strict substrate recognition, these methyltransferases, especially OMTs, have been well characterized (2Ruffer M. Nagakura N. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1983; 49: 131-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Müller M.J. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1992; 58: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 4Sato F. Tsujita T.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 29-36PubMed Google Scholar). Characterizations, except for SMT, which has been purified to homogeneity, were done, however, with highly but incompletely purified enzymes, because of the high similarity of 4′- and 6-OMT. In our previous attempt to purify 6-OMT from cultured Coptis japonica cells, two homologous 41- and 40-kDa polypeptides were isolated. Because the highly purified fraction showed both 6- and 4′-OMT activities, we speculated that these 41- and 40-kDa polypeptides encode 6- or 4′-OMT by themselves or with the aid of a heterodimer. To confirm whether this is so, we isolated the cDNAs corresponding to the internal amino acids of each polypeptide then characterized the enzyme activities using recombinant proteins heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein expressed from the cDNA of the 41-kDa polypeptide had 4′-OMT activity and that of the 40-kDa one 6-OMT activity. Enzymological properties of 4′-OMT purified without 6-OMT contamination were determined from its recombinant protein. The original cultured cells were induced from rootlets of C. japonica Makino var. dissecta (Yatabe) Nakai. A cell line (156-1) that produces large amounts of alkaloids was subcultured as described elsewhere (12Sato F. Yamada Y. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 281-285Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Fourteen-day-old cultured cells were harvested and used for the extraction of mRNA. Berberine was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). (R,S)-Norlaudanosoline and (R,S)-laudanosoline were from Aldrich. (R)- and (S)-Coclaurine were the gift of Dr. N. Nagakura of Kobe Women's College of Pharmacy. The other alkaloids used were gifts from Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, Ltd. 6-OMT was purified from cultured Coptis cells, after which two 41- and 40-kDa polypeptides were isolated by reverse phase HPLC as described previously (4Sato F. Tsujita T. Katagiri Y. Yoshida S. Yamada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The 41-kDa polypeptide was digested with trypsin, the 40-kDa one with the lysyl endopeptidase from Achromobacteror Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease using a Residue-specific Protease Kit (TaKaRa). The amino acid sequences of the peptides were determined with a protein sequencer (model 477A/120A; Applied Biosystems). A cDNA library of cultured Coptis cells was prepared with a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit and Gigapack II Gold packaging extract (Stratagene) as described elsewhere (11Takeshita N. Fujiwara H. Mimura H. Fitchen J.H. Yamada Y. Sato F. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 29-36PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide probes used to screen the cDNA library were based on the internal amino acid sequences of the 41- and 40-kDa polypeptides. The 41-kDa probe 1, 5′-ATGGTICCIATGATHYTIGGIATGACICARAA-3′, corresponded to MVPMILGMTQK and the 41-kDa probe 2, 5′-ATHYTICAYGAYTGGAAYGA-3′, to ILHDWND. The 40-kDa probe 1, 5′-GGIACIAATATTTGGGGITATATGGC-3′, corresponded to GTNIWGYMA and the 40 kDa probe 2, 5′-TTTAATGAAGCIATGGCIAATAA-3′, to FNEAMAND (in which probes I = inosine, H = A or C or T, Y = C or T, R = A or G). The first screening with the 41-kDa probe 1 yielded 18 positive signals, and the third screening yielded 9 independent phages. Similarly, 70 positive signals were obtained by the first screening with 40-kDa probe 1 and 18 independent phages by the third screening. The cDNA inserts of the plasmid vector (pBluescript II SK−) were excised in vivo with a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit and used for transformation to E. coliXL1-Blue. The cDNA clones (designated pBS41 for the 41-kDa polypeptide and pBS40 for the 40-kDa polypeptide) were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using both probes and by digestion with the restriction enzyme. cDNA sequences were determined with deletion clones prepared with ExoIII and an ALF DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and an ABI 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled primers. Expression vectors for these polypeptides were constructed without the fused peptides derived from vector sequence in a pET-21d vector (Novagen). The 5′-fragment of the 41-kDa polypeptide cDNA (pBS41) was amplified by PCR by use of the following primers: the forward primer (5′-GAGAATTAACATGTCTTTCCATGG-3′) was designed to introduce an AflIII site (ACPuPyGT) at the ATG start codon and the reverse primer (5′-TCCACCGACGTCAACAAGTGAGTC-3′) to introduce an AatII site (GACGTC) with no modification of the conserved amino acid sequence in motif A of the AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase (13Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The 3′-fragment of the 41-kDa polypeptide cDNA was amplified by use of the M13 primer and the forward primer 5′-TCACTTGTTGACGTCGGTGGAGG-3′ to introduce anAatII site with no change in the amino acid sequence of motif A. The full-length cDNA that encoded the 40-kDa polypeptide (pBS40) was amplified by PCR with the M13 primer and the forward primer 5′-CAGAATCATAGACATGTTAGTGAAGAAGAAGG-3′ to introduce an AflIII site at the start codon. Restriction sites were introduced by changing the underlined bases. pET-21d was digested with NcoI and XhoI, and the PCR products were ligated into the vector. The expression vectors were designated pE41 for the 41-kDa polypeptide and pE40 for the 40-kDa one. These constructs were completely sequenced to confirm that no changes were introduced by the subcloning process. The expression vector for the 41- or 40-kDa polypeptide was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were induced with 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside, incubated at 16 °C for 24 h, then harvested and sonicated in extraction buffer (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm ascorbate and 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The supernatant was desalted through an NAP-5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to assay both 4′-OMT and 6-OMT activities. 4′-OMT and 6-OMT activities were detected by HPLC and liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). Whereas (S)-3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine and (S)-norcoclaurine are the true intermediates in reticuline biosynthesis (3Müller M.J. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1992; 58: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), (R,S)-6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline (6-OMe-NLS) and (R,S)-norlaudanosoline (NLS) were used as the substrates for the routine assays of 4′-OMT and 6-OMT, respectively, due to the availability of these compounds and similar product formation in the reaction (Fig. 1) (4Sato F. Tsujita T. Katagiri Y. Yoshida S. Yamada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Frenzel T. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3505-3511Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The standard 4′-OMT reaction mixture consisted of 0.3 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 25 mm sodium ascorbate, 1 mm 6-OMe-NLS, 1 mm AdoMet, and the enzyme preparation. The standard 6-OMT reaction mixture consisted of 0.3 m CHES-NaOH (pH 9.0), 25 mm sodium ascorbate, 1 mm NLS, 1 mmAdoMet, and the enzyme preparation. The assay mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, after which the reaction was terminated by the addition of methanol. After protein precipitation, the reaction product was detected by reverse phase HPLC (mobile phase, 22% acetonitrile/H2O for the 4′-OMT assay and 18% for the 6-OMT assay containing 1% acetic acid; column, LiChrospher 100 RP-18(e) (4 × 250 mm; Cica-Merck); flow rate, 0.8 ml/min; detection, absorbance measurement at 280 nm). Mass spectra were obtained with an API165 (Perkin-Elmer). To quantify the enzymatic activity of 4′-OMT, the transfer of the3H-labeled methyl group of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) to the product was measured. Reaction conditions have been described elsewhere (4Sato F. Tsujita T. Katagiri Y. Yoshida S. Yamada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Large scale production of 4′-OMT was obtained with 600-ml cultures of E. coli. Purification was done at 4 °C. All the buffers used contained 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol. The crude bacterial lysate was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (2.5 × 10 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient of 0–1 m in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (total volume: 100 ml). Active fractions were applied to a Bio-Gel HTP column (2.5 × 10 cm; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Proteins were eluted with a linear potassium phosphate gradient of 10–500 mm (total volume: 160 ml). Major enzyme activity-containing fractions were pooled and kept at −20 °C in the presence of approximately 40% glycerol, with no detectable activity loss over 5 months. The subunit molecular mass of the enzyme was ascertained by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide), and the molecular mass of the native enzyme by gel filtration chromatography through a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in fast protein liquid chromatography. Protein was determined according to Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. A cDNA library prepared from C. japonica cells was screened with oligonucleotide probes designed for the internal amino acid sequences of the purified 41- and 40-kDa polypeptides. After approximately 200,000 plaque-forming units had been screened, 9 positive plaques were identified for the 41-kDa polypeptide and 18 for the 40-kDa one. cDNAs isolated in pBluescript SK−(designated pBS41s and pBS40s) had inserts of 1.0–1.4 kilobase pairs. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA inserts of pBS41 and pBS40, which encoded the longest polypeptide, and of other cDNA inserts were determined (GenBankTM accession numbers:D29812 for 41 kDa and D29811 for 40 kDa). Sequences respectively corresponding to the 41- and 40-kDa polypeptides carried 1,280 and 1,267 nucleotides, with open reading frames that encoded for 350 and 347 amino acids (Fig. 2). The calculated molecular masses of the pBS41 (38,731 Da) and pBS40 (38,655 Da) inserts were less than the observed molecular masses of the 41- and 40-kDa polypeptides from Coptis cells, but the deduced amino acid sequences had almost all the internal amino acid sequences determined from the purified polypeptides. Both polypeptide sequences had conserved putative AdoMet binding domains at the C-terminal end (Fig. 2, motif A-C) (13Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and both had 52 amino acids between motifs A and B and 30 amino acids between motifs B and C. This spatial relationship is identical to that of the caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferases. The 41- and 40-kDa polypeptides therefore belong to the Pl (plant)-OMT II group (13Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Their deduced amino acid sequences have a high degree of similarity (52% identity); whereas SMT, which also functions in berberine biosynthesis, showed much lower homology when its amino acid sequence was compared with that of the 41- or 40-kDa polypeptide (about 30% identity, see Fig. 2). Both polypeptides had a high degree of similarity (about 40% identity) to the isoflavone 7-O-methyltransferase of alfalfa (15He X.Z. Reddy J.T. Dixon R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), 6a-hydroxymaackiain 3-O-methyltransferase of pea (16Wu Q. Perisig C.L. VanEtten H.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and hydroxycinnamic acids/hydroxycinnamoyl CoA estersO-methyltransferase of lobolly pine (17Li L. Popko J.L. Zhang X.H. Osakabe K. Tsai C.J. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5461-5477Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). SMT had greater similarity to the caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferases and catechol O-methyltransferases of several plant species. Both the 41- and 40-kDa polypeptides had a somewhat low identity (24 and 35%, respectively) to catechol OMTs from Thalictrum tuberosum (Thatu 1 and 2, respective GenBankTMaccession numbers AF064693 and AF064694), even though these catechol OMTs from cultured T. tuberosum cells could methylate the 6-hydroxyl group of norcoclaurine (18Frick S. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Phylogenic analysis clearly indicated that both the polypeptides belong to a different branch than the catechol OMT from Thalictrum (Thatu 2) (Fig.3). Expression vectors (pE41 and pE40, respectively) to produce recombinant proteins in E. coli were constructed to identify the enzymological activities of the 41- and 40-kDa polypeptides. We modified the first methionine codons of both cDNA inserts to fit the NcoI-XhoI sites of the E. coliexpression vector pET-21d to obtain expression of nontagged polypeptides. These constructs then were introduced into E. coli cells, and recombinant protein production was induced. The crude E. coli lysate was used to identify the enzymatic activities of both 4′- and 6-OMT. HPLC analysis clearly showed that the cell lysate that expresses pE41 had methylation activity for 3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine, but not for norcoclaurine, whereas the lysate containing pE40 had methylation activity for norcoclaurine but not for 3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine (data not shown). The crude E. coli lysate carrying the pET-21d vector showed no enzymatic activity. LC-MS analysis confirmed that the respective reaction products of 41 kDa with 6-OMe-NLS and of 40 kDa with NLS were norreticuline and 6-OMe-NLS (Fig.4), indicative that the 41-kDa polypeptide corresponds to 4′-OMT and the 40-kDa one to 6-OMT. Because preparation of 4′-OMT without 6-OMT contamination is now possible, we tried to prepare highly purified 4′-OMT from E. coli. The final purification was 9.8-fold and the yield 35.9% (TableI and Fig.5). SDS-PAGE analysis showed clearly that the purified fraction was almost homogeneous. The molecular mass of active 4′-OMT was estimated to be about 80 kDa by gel filtration chromatography, evidence that active 4′-OMT is a dimer of the 41-kDa subunit. Enzyme assays at various pH values indicated that the optimum pH for the methylation of 6-OMe-NLS was about 8.0. Half-maximal activity was found at pH 6.6 or 8.6.Table IPurification of recombinant 4′-OMT from E. coli lysatePurification stepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationRecoverymgnkatpkat/mg-fold%Crude extract1637.546.11.0100Q-Sepharose65.83.958.71.351.3Bio-Gel HTP6.02.74539.835.9 Open table in a new tab 4′-OMT, like Coptis 6-OMT, did not require divalent cations for activity. The addition of Fe2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Zn2+, or Ni2+ at 5 mm inhibited 4′-OMT activity, respectively, by 87%, 100%, 86%, 48%, or 96%. These cations also inhibited 6-OMT activity (4Sato F. Tsujita T. Katagiri Y. Yoshida S. Yamada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Other cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+) had no effect on 4′-OMT activity. The enzymatic activity of 4′-OMT, like that of 6-OMT, was negligibly inhibited by SH reagents (p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate and iodacetamide) or EDTA at 1 mm. When, however, berberine (the end product of isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis in Coptis cells) was added to the assay mixture at 2.5 mm, 4′-OMT activity was not inhibited, whereas 1 mm berberine inhibited 6-OMT activity by 30% (4Sato F. Tsujita T. Katagiri Y. Yoshida S. Yamada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Purified 4′-OMT was used as the antigen to prepare anti-4′-OMT polyclonal antibody. In a Western blot analysis with this antibody, both the crude extract of E. coli-expressing 4′-OMT and the Coptis proteins had a major immunoreactive band of the same molecular mass (data not shown). This suggests that 4′-OMT is produced in mature form in E. coli, whereas the SMT expressed in E. coli apparently is longer than that purified fromCoptis cells (10Sato F. Takeshita N. Fitchen J.H. Fujiwara H. Yamada Y. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 659-664Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis of full-length 4′-OMT, 6-OMT, and SMT showed a difference in the hydrophobicity of their N termini. There was no evidence that 4′- or 6-OMT is located in specific vesicles, whereas SMT had a hydrophobic signal sequence of 10 amino acids at its N terminus (10Sato F. Takeshita N. Fitchen J.H. Fujiwara H. Yamada Y. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 659-664Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The incorporation of radioactivity fromS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine to the products was used as a marker of substrate specificity (Fig.6). When (R,S)-6-OMe-NLS was the control substrate (i.e. relative incorporation 100%), the respective relative activities with (R,S)-laudanosoline and (R,S)-norlaudanosoline were 767 and 118%, whereas no significant methylation was found for the other substrates. The preferential methylation of laudanosoline rather than norlaudanosoline suggests that N-methylation proceeds before 4′-O-methylation, as suggested by Stadler and Zenk (1Stadler R. Zenk M.H. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1990; 6: 555-562Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Whereas (S)-3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine is the true intermediate in reticuline biosynthesis (3Müller M.J. Zenk M.H. Planta Med. 1992; 58: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), 6-OMe-NLS was used as the substrate for the kinetic assay of 4′-OMT due to the availability of this compound and similar product formation in the reaction (5Frenzel T. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3505-3511Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Substrate-saturation kinetics of the purified 4′-OMT for 6-OMe-NLS and AdoMet were the typical Michaelis-Menten type. Kinetic parameters therefore were estimated from double-reciprocal plots of the initial velocity versus the substrate concentration. By varying the concentration of 6-OMe-NLS and [3H]AdoMet in the range of 8–125 μm, a set of apparent Km and V max values could be calculated and replotted to determine the real Km and V max. The respective Kmvalues of 4′-OMT for (R,S)-6-OMe-NLS and AdoMet were 42 and 68 μm, with a V max of 1.8 nkat/mg protein. The pattern of primary reciprocal plots was representative of a sequential substrate binding mechanism (data not shown). Product inhibition analysis was used to determine the reaction mechanism. 4′-O-methylated 6-OMe-NLS (norreticuline) was used for inhibition by the methylated alkaloid. Double-reciprocal plots of the initial velocity versus the concentrations of 6-OMe-NLS, with respect to different fixed concentrations of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy), gave a series of lines intersecting to the left of the y axis (Fig.7 A). AdoHcy inhibition therefore was noncompetitive with respect to variations in 6-OMe-NLS as the substrate, and the Ki value was 43 μm. The inhibition constants were obtained as described elsewhere (19Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Longman Group Ltd., London1979Google Scholar). AdoHcy inhibition with respect to varying AdoMet gave a series of lines that intersected at the y axis, indicative that the inhibition was competitive (Fig. 7 B). The Ki value for AdoHcy versus AdoMet was 27 μm. Norreticuline inhibition with respect to varying the 6-OMe-NLS and AdoMet concentrations gave a series of lines intersecting to the left of the y axis (Fig. 7, C and D). Norreticuline inhibition with respect to 6-OMe-NLS and AdoMet therefore was noncompetitive. The respectiveKi values for norreticuline versus6-OMe-NLS and AdoMet were 103 and 115 μm. These findings indicate that 4′-OMT followed an ordered Bi Bi mechanism, in which AdoMet binds to the enzyme before the alkaloid substrate binds to the enzyme, after which the methylated alkaloid and AdoHcy are released sequentially. We isolated full-length cDNA clones that encodes 3′-hydroxy-N-methylcoclaurine 4′-OMT and 6-OMT from culturedC. japonica cells. Clone identity was confirmed by the catalytic activities of the heterologously expressed polypeptides. Because these enzymes had very similar physical properties, it was not possible to separate them in the active form (4Sato F. Tsujita T. Katagiri Y. Yoshida S. Yamada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Frenzel T. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3505-3511Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our study provides the first evidence that 4′-OMT and 6-OMT are encoded by different polypeptides. Characterization of the recombinant 4′-OMT indicated that previous data obtained for partially purified Berberis 4′-OMT was reliable. Coptis 4′-OMT has a substrate specificity similar to that of the Berberis enzyme; an adjacent 3′-hydroxyl group is essential for the 4′-O-methylation reaction, and N-methylation of the substrate enhances the reaction rate. Previous reports suggested that 4′- and 6-OMT have similar physical properties (4Sato F. Tsujita T. Katagiri Y. Yoshida S. Yamada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Frenzel T. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3505-3511Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Indeed, they have similar enzymological properties that are distinct from those of SMT: active 4′- and 6-OMT are dimers of the subunit, whereas SMT is a trimer. 4′- and 6-OMT activities are negligibly inhibited by SH reagents, whereas SMT activity is inhibited by the SH reagent, p-chloromercuribenzonate, evidence that the SH group(s) is involved in SMT activities. Effects of cations on the 4′- and 6-OMT activities were very similar, but each polypeptide has distinctive properties in terms of Km values, substrate specificity, and the proposed reaction mechanism. Interestingly, 4′-OMT activity was not sensitive to berberine, the end product of alkaloid biosynthesis in Coptis, whereas the inhibitory effect of alkaloids on Berberis 4′-OMT (5Frenzel T. Zenk M.H. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3505-3511Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and Coptis 6-OMT and SMT has been reported (4Sato F. Tsujita T. Katagiri Y. Yoshida S. Yamada Y. Eur. J.

OMT characteristics are summarized in TableII. The deduced amino acid sequences of 4′- and 6-OMT have 52% identity, and SMT has 30% identity to both 4′- and 6-OMT. The enzymological similarities and differences are interesting in terms of molecular evolution and sequence similarities and diversities, in particular the aspects of substrate recognition.Table IIO-Methyltransferases in berberine biosynthesisEnzyme (origin)Molecular masspH optimumKmforKi for AdoHcyversusInhibitorsReaction mechanismGel filtrationSDS-PAGEMethyl acceptorAdoMetMethyl acceptorAdoMetkDaμmμm4′-OMT (Coptis, this study)80418.042 for (R,S)-6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline6843 for (R,S)-6-O-methylnorlaudanosoline27Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Fe2+Ordered Bi Bi4′-OMT (Berberis) (4)51407.54.530ND2.5NDND6-OMT (Coptis) (3)95409.02.2 × 103 for (R,S)-norlaudanosoline3.95 × 1030.18 × 103 for (R,S)-norlaudanosoline2.1 × 103Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Mn2+Ping Pong Bi Bi6-OMT (Argemone) (1)47ND8.3–8.50.2 × 103for (R,S)-norlaudanosoline20NDNDNi2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Fe2+,p-chloromercuribenzonateNDSMT (Coptis) (6)120–140419.0–9.50.1 × 103 for (R,S)-scoulerine0.17 × 103ND0.17 × 103Ca2+, Cu2+, Mn2+,p-chloromercuribenzonateRandom-order equilibriumCharacteristics of the five OMTs in berberine biosynthesis are given.

Plant J. 1998; 13: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) utilize benzylisoquinoline alkaloids as substrate. The multiple sequence alignments of Coptis OMTs and these enzymes did not, however, show any sequence homology (data not shown). As with many proteins, the three-dimensional structure, rather than the primary sequence, is more important for substrate recognition. The C-terminal ends of 4′-OMT and 6-OMT are highly conserved (58% identity) for the putative AdoMet binding, but the N-terminal ends are more divergent even among these related OMTs (47% identity) (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that the N-terminal end constitutes the alkaloid-binding pocket and that these sequence diversities reflect the substrate specificities of the enzymes. X-ray diffraction studies of Coptis OMTs, characterization of the chimeric enzymes among the CoptisOMTs, or both, should prove useful for understanding the importance of the N-terminal end of OMT in substrate recognition. Frick and Kutchan (19Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Longman Group Ltd., London1979Google Scholar) reported that catechol OMTs (Thatu 1 and 2) isolated from T. tuberosum cells have very broad substrate specificity and catalyze the 6-hydroxyl methylation of norcoclaurine. These enzymes catalyzed the same reaction for 6-OMT, but showed fairly low identity with 6-OMT (35% identity). They obtained another catechol OMT (Thatu 4), which could not catalyze the methylation of isoquinoline alkaloid. Thatu 1 and Thatu 4 differ by only one amino acid; Thatu 1 has tyrosine, and Thatu 4 has cysteine at position 21. As shown in Fig.3, the alkaloid and phenylpropanoid OMTs may be related evolutionarily, whereas the 4′- and 6-OMT obviously belong to a different branch of the phylogenic tree. OMTs provide us useful information on the molecular evolution of secondary plant metabolism. We thank Dr. N. Nagakura and Mitsui Petrochemical Industries Ltd. for their generous gifts of the alkaloids, and we are grateful to Dr. A. Ishihara of Kyoto University for his technical assistance in the LC-MS analysis."

The biological mechanism of action of neuromedin U remains unknown, despite the fact that the peptide was first isolated in 1985. Here we show that neuromedin U potently activates the orphan G protein-coupled receptor FM3, with subnanomolar potency, when FM3 is transiently expressed in human HEK-293 cells. Neuromedins B, C, K, and N are all inactive at this receptor. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of neuromedin U expression in a range of human tissues showed that the peptide is highly expressed in the intestine, pituitary, and bone marrow, with lower levels of expression seen in stomach, adipose tissue, lymphocytes, spleen, and the cortex. Similar analysis of FM3 expression showed that the receptor is widely expressed in human tissue with highest levels seen in adipose tissue, intestine, spleen, and lymphocytes, suggesting that neuromedin U may have a wide range of presently undetermined physiological effects. The discovery that neuromedin U is an endogenous agonist for FM3 will significantly aid the study of the full physiological role of this peptide.

The current explosion in the availability of human genomic sequence data is allowing many more members of this family to be identified in man. Most if not all of these newly identified GPCRs fall into the category of orphan receptors, for which the endogenous ligand(s) remain to be identified. Typically these orphan receptors show only low levels of similarity (less than 35% identity) with known GPCRs, too low to classify them with any confidence into a specific receptor subfamily, although one can often predict the likely class of ligand for these receptors,e.g. peptide, nucleotide, lipid, etc., by using phylogenetic analysis. Recently, naturally occurring ligands have been identified for a number of these orphan GPCRs using a “reverse-pharmacological” approach (1.Stadel J.M. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 430-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), that is using the recombinant orphan receptor as a specific sensor component of a bioassay. Tissue extracts have often been the source of these natural ligands (2.Meunier J.C. Mollereau C. Toll L. Suaudeau C. Moisand C. Alvinerie P. Butour J.L. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Monsarrat B.

Here, we describe how this latter approach has been used to identify neuromedin U (NmU) as a naturally occurring ligand for the orphan receptor FM3. Neuromedin U was first isolated over 15 years ago from extracts of porcine spinal cord, using a uterine smooth muscle contraction bioassay to monitor purification (7.Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Two molecular forms were isolated; neuromedin U-8 (NmU-8) and neuromedin U-25 (NmU-25). NmU-like immunoreactivity has since been detected in neurones in the mammalian brain and gastrointestinal tracts of various species (8.Domin J. Ghatei M.A. Chohan P. Bloom S.R.

Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), can regulate local blood flow in the intestine (12.Sumi S. Inoue K. Kogire M. Doi R.

Pharmacol. 1991; 193: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, complex effects on steroid secretion from the adrenal cortex have also been reported (18.Malendowicz L.K. Nussdorfer G.G. Markowska A. Tortorella C. Nowak M. Warchol J.B. Neuropeptides. 1994; 26: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19.Malendowicz L.K. Andreis P.G. Markowska A. Nowak M. Warchol J.B. Neri G. Nussdorfer G.G. Res. Exp. Med. 1994; 194: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Despite this large body of literature strongly suggesting an extracellular transmitter role for NmU, a receptor for this neuropeptide has not been discovered, until now. The human orphan GPCR FM3 was originally identified (20.Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Liu Q. Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Genomics. 1998; 52: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) by similarity to the mouse orthologue. The mouse gene was identified from a mouse T-cell expressed sequence tag library by similarity screening of GenBankTM using the human GHS-R sequence as a query sequence (GHS-R was an orphan subsequently characterized as a receptor for the naturally occurring peptide ghrelin (21.Kojima M. Hosoda H. Date Y. Nakazato M. Matsuo H. Kangawa K. Nature. 1999; 402: 656-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (7105) Google Scholar)). The FM3 sequence has many of the characteristics of Family 1 GPCRs, including the ERY variant of the DRY motif at the boundary of transmembrane domain 3 and the second intracellular loop, and consensus sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation and phosphorylation on amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences, respectively. Phylogenetic comparison with other GPCR sequences (data not shown) suggests that the natural ligand for FM3 is likely to be a peptide, as the closest relatives to FM3 are receptors for neuropeptides. To investigate putative physiological roles of this newly discovered ligand/receptor pairing, we also describe the first quantitative comparison of both NmU precursor and receptor mRNA expression in a wide variety of human tissues using the technique of RT-PCR. We cloned FM3 from a human placenta library using gene-specific primers. A 403-amino acid protein was obtained that was 100% identical to the originally published sequence for this receptor (20.Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Liu Q. Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Genomics. 1998; 52: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number NP_006047). Receptors were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDN (22.Aiyar N. Baker E. Wu H.L. Nambi P. Edwards R.M. Trill J.J. Ellis C. Bergsma D.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells using LipofectAMINE plus (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Intracellular calcium assays were carried out as follows. HEK-293 cells transiently expressing FM3 were seeded (50,000 cells/well) into poly-d-lysine coated 96-well black-wall, clear-bottom microtiter plates (Becton Dickinson) 24 h prior to assay. Cells were loaded for 1 h with 1 μm Fluo-4-AM fluorescent indicator dye (Molecular Probes) in assay buffer (Hanks' balanced salts solution, 10 mmHEPES, 200 μm Ca2+, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm probenecid), washed three times with assay buffer, then returned to the incubator for 10 min before assay on a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices). Maximum change in fluorescence over base line was used to determine agonist response. Cells were screened against a large library of over 1500 known and putative GPCR agonists, including all known mammalian neuropeptides (tachykinins, neuromedins, etc.), bioactive lipids (leukotrienes, prostaglandins, etc.), steroids (aldosterone, testosterone, etc.), amines (catacholamines, etc.), cannabinoids (anandamide, etc.), nucleotides (ATP, ADP, UTP, etc.), and sugar nucleotides (UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, etc.). Peptides were tested at a final concentration of >100 nm, and other ligands at >1 μm. Concentration response curve data were fitted to a four parameter logistic equation using GraFit (Erithacus Software Limited). Assays for intracellular cAMP were carried out as described previously (4.Chambers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G. Dytko G.M. Foley J.J. Martin J. Liu W.S. Park J. Ellis C. Ganguly S. Konchar S. Cluderay J. Leslie R. Wilson S. Sarau H.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Inositol phosphate accumulation assays were performed as described previously (23.Yue T.L. Nambi P. Wu H.L. Feuerstein G. Neuroscience. 1991; 44: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with FM3 were loaded overnight with myo[3H]inositol. Cells were treated for 30 min at 37 °C with NmU-25. The reaction was stopped with trichloroacetic acid. Samples were purified using columns containing AG 1 × 8 anion exchange resin. Total inositol phosphates were eluted using 1m ammonium formate containing 0.1 m formic acid. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was carried out as described previously (5.Sarau H.M. Ames R.S. Chambers J. Ellis C. Elshourbagy N. Foley J.J. Schmidt D.B. Muccitelli R.M. Jenkins O. Murdock P.R. Herrity N.C. Halsey W. Sathe G. Muir A.I. Nuthulaganti P. Dytko G.M. Buckley P.T. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J.

Porcine neuromedin U-8 (NmU-8) and human neuromedin K were obtained from Sigma. Porcine neuromedin U-25 (NmU-25), rat neuromedin U-23 (NmU-23), and human neurotensin, motilin, and neuromedins B, C, and N were obtained from Bachem. Ghrelin was obtained from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals. As part of a large program to identify natural ligands for orphan GPCRs, we transiently expressed FM3 in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells and functionally screened these cells on a FLIPR to measure mobilization of intracellular calcium in response to a large library of over 1500 putative GPCR ligands rich in potential peptide ligands for FM3. NmU-8, NmU-25, and NmU-23 were the only peptides that produced orphan-mediated calcium mobilization in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing FM3. Responses to NmU in these cells were large, transient, and robust (Fig.1 A). Mock-transfected HEK-293 cells did not respond to any isoform of NmU (Fig. 1 A), nor did cells that had been transiently transfected with a number of other orphan GPCRs (data not shown). We investigated the concentration dependence of FM3 activation by porcine and rat NmU isoforms (Fig. 1 B). In a FLIPR assay, all 3 NmU isoforms tested caused the same maximal activation of FM3 with EC50 values of 0.21 ± 0.02 nm(n = 6), 0.38 ± 0.03 nm(n = 6), and 0.17 ± 0.02 nm(n = 6) for NmU-8, NmU-25, and NmU-23, respectively. Thus all three peptides cause potent activation of FM3, suggesting that NmU is the natural agonist for this receptor. Neuromedins B, C, K, and N were all inactive at FM3 (Fig. 1 B) in this assay, as were neurotensin, ghrelin, motilin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and pancreatic polypeptide, when tested at concentrations up to 1 μm (data not shown). The calcium mobilization response seen following activation of FM3 by NmU suggests that this receptor is coupled to G proteins of the Gq/11 subfamily. In agreement with this hypothesis, NmU-8 and NmU-25 caused identical mobilization of intracellular calcium in both control and pertussis toxin-treated HEK-293 cells transiently expressing FM3 (data not shown), suggesting that activation of G proteins from the Gi/o subfamily and subsequent Gβγ-mediated activation of phospholipase Cβ does not contribute to the functional response observed. In addition, neither basal nor forskolin-elevated levels of intracellular cAMP were modulated by any form of NmU (data not shown) in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing FM3, suggesting that this receptor does not couple strongly to G proteins of the Gs or Gi/o subfamilies. To provide further proof that NmU is an agonist at FM3, we studied changes in total inositol phosphates in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing FM3 following challenge with NmU (Fig. 1 C). NmU-25 produced a potent, dose-dependent increase in total inositol phosphates with an EC50 of 0.28 ± 0.02 nm (n = 3). No response was observed in mock-transfected cells. This strongly supports the calcium mobilization data and provides further evidence that stimulation of FM3 causes activation of phospholipase C. To further investigate the physiological role of FM3 we carried out studies to localize the expression of this receptor in human tissues. We performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis using FM3 specific primers to determine the relative levels of FM3 mRNA in a variety of tissues from multiple individuals. We observed a widespread human tissue distribution (Fig.2), in good agreement with results previously published for the mouse receptor (20.Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Liu Q. Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Genomics. 1998; 52: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the highest levels of expression of FM3 mRNA were seen in adipose tissue, with moderate levels observed in the intestine, lymphocytes, stomach, pancreas, bone marrow, and spleen. Low levels of expression were seen in most other tissues studied, including a widespread, low level distribution throughout central nervous system tissues (Fig.3). No expression was detected in cartilage or bone.Figure 3Human central nervous system tissue distribution of FM3 and neuromedin U, as demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR. The cDNA from the reverse transcription of 1 ng of poly(A)+ RNA from multiple tissues for four different nondiseased individuals was assessed by TaqMan PCR for FM3 and neuromedin U precursor mRNA and, as a control, mRNA for the housekeeper gene GAPDH. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of four individual's mRNA level for each tissue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To compare and contrast the localization of FM3 with its cognate ligand, NmU, we went on to study the expression pattern of the mRNA encoding the NmU precursor in the same set of human tissues (Figs. 2and 3). The highest levels of expression were observed in intestine, bone marrow, pituitary, and fetal liver (Fig. 2), although interestingly the expression in liver appears to be developmentally regulated, since no expression was observed in adult liver samples. Lower levels of expression were observed in many tissues, including adipose, stomach, lymphocytes, placenta, and spleen. A more detailed study of the central nervous system distribution of human NmU (Fig. 3) showed that in addition to the pituitary, several cortical areas of the brain such as the cingulate gyrus and medial frontal gyrus also express moderate levels of NmU precursor. Low to moderate levels of expression were also observed in many other brain regions, including the hypothalamus, locus coruleus, thalamus, medulla oblongata, and substantia nigra (Fig. 3). For many years a receptor for NmU has remained elusive; this has hampered the full elucidation of its physiological roles. In this report we identify FM3 as a specific receptor for NmU and show that NmU causes potent activation of this receptor. This finding will stimulate research into the fundamental physiological effects of NmU. NmU was first isolated in two molecular forms from extracts of porcine spinal cord and was so called because of its ability to stimulate contraction of uterine smooth muscle (7.Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The longer COOH-terminally amidated porcine peptide (NmU-25) contains 25 amino acids, while the shorter peptide (NmU-8) is a result of proteolytic processing of NmU-25 at the Arg16-Arg17 site and represents the amidated COOH-terminal 8 amino acids of the longer form. NmU was subsequently identified in many mammals, including humans (24.Domin J. Ghatei M.A. Chohan P. Bloom S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the human gene encoding the NmU precursor peptide has been cloned (25.Austin C. Lo G. Nandha K.A. Meleagros L. Bloom S.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 14: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The sequence of the biologically active COOH-terminal region of the peptide is almost completely conserved across all species studied (26.Salmon A.L. Johnsen A.H. Bienert M. McMurray G. Nandha K.A. Bloom S.R. Shaw C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4549-4554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), indicating the strong degree of selection to retain this physiologically important region of sequence. Interestingly, the dibasic cleavage site is not conserved in many species, e.g.rat, rabbit, and humans, and only the long form of NmU has been isolated from these species. Despite the fact that NmU has been known for more than 15 years, the broader physiological role of this peptide has not been extensively studied and is still not well understood. This is due in part to the fact that a receptor for NmU has, until now, been unknown. Nandhaet al. (27.Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Smith D.M. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have shown that a high affinity, specific binding site for NmU exists in rat uterus. Furthermore, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP, GTPγS, reduced NmU binding in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that this uterine receptor was indeed a member of the GPCR superfamily. The subnanomolar potencies of NmU, which we report here, are typical of many neuropeptides at their cognate receptors and are also consistent with the potent binding affinities reported with rat NmU binding to rat tissues (27.Nandha K.A. Benito-Orfila M.A. Smith D.M. Bloom S.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity of the response to NmU we re-tested, at higher concentrations, a number of peptides that were inactive in the original screen, but which might conceivably exhibit cross-reactivity with FM3 for various reasons. Thus all known neuromedins were re-tested over a range of concentrations up to 1 μm, in view of the similarity of reported functions of these peptides. Likewise, ghrelin, motilin, and neurotensin were similarly re-tested, since the corresponding receptors for these peptides show significant sequence similarity to FM3 (20.Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Liu Q. Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Genomics. 1998; 52: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Last, pancreatic polypeptide and vasoactive intestinal peptide were also tested in this way in view of their reported sequence similarity to neuromedin U at the COOH terminus (12.Sumi S. Inoue K. Kogire M. Doi R. Takaori K. Suzuki T. Yajima H. Tobe T. Life Sci. 1987; 41: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The absence of detectable activity from any of these peptides confirms the specificity of the interaction of neuromedin U with FM3. The physiological role of neuromedin U is not fully understood. The smooth muscle contracting activity of NmU has been well documented, but the complex effects on steroid secretion from the adrenal cortex suggest that there may be much to learn about the physiological role of NmU. Important clues that can suggest novel functions for NmU could be obtained most simply by measuring the expression levels of both peptide and cognate receptor throughout the body. Obviously, this has not been possible until now. In the present study we have described for the first time a quantitative, side-by-side comparison of both NmU precursor and receptor mRNA expression across a wide variety of human tissues. The low receptor expression levels seen in the brain are broadly consistent with similar Northern blot data available for mouse tissue (20.Tan C.P. McKee K.K. Liu Q. Palyha O.C. Feighner S.D. Hreniuk D.L. Smith R.G. Howard A.D. Genomics. 1998; 52: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), although the low levels previously observed in mouse spleen contrast with the relatively high levels of FM3 expression in human spleen observed in this study. Relatively high levels of FM3 expression were observed by us in both intestine and stomach, and these data are entirely consistent with NmU's well characterized effects on these tissues (12.Sumi S.

Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 193: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the high levels of receptor expression observed in other previously unreported human tissues, such as adipose tissue, suggest there may be additional functions for NmU, perhaps involving modulation of energy expenditure. The distribution of NmU mRNA is widespread, including relatively high levels in intestine and pituitary. In addition, NmU message is also expressed in many other brain regions, especially the cortex (Figs. 2 and 3). This is concordant with early immunological studies that characterized NmU as a gut-brain peptide and is also in agreement with Northern blot studies showing mRNA expression throughout the rat (28.Austin C. Oka M. Nandha K.A. Legon S. Khandan-Nia N. Lo G. Bloom S.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 12: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and human (25.Austin C. Lo G. Nandha K.A. Meleagros L. Bloom S.R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 14: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) intestine and in rat pituitary (29.Lo G. Legon S. Austin C. Wallis S. Wang Z. Bloom S.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1538-1544PubMed Google Scholar). NmU mRNA was also observed in several regions which had previously not been studied, such as adipose tissue, again supporting a putative role of this ligand/receptor pair in modulation of energy expenditure. Likewise, high levels of NmU mRNA expression in bone marrow suggests a potential role in hematopoietic function. In conclusion, these data demonstrate the discovery of a specific receptor for NmU. The widespread tissue distribution of both FM3 and NmU suggest that this peptide, in addition to its well characterized role in smooth muscle contraction, may be involved in a number of additional, but as yet undefined, physiological roles.

The cDNA obtained by immunoscreening a human pancreatic cDNA library using the recently described murine monoclonal antibody D24 contains an open reading frame of 828 base pairs. This codes for a cytoplasmic protein with six putative EF finger hand calcium-binding motifs. The gene could be localized to chromosome 6 by alignment with GenBank genomic sequence data. Northern blot analysis demonstrated abundant expression of this protein in the pancreas and to a lesser extent in the thyroid, adrenal medulla, and cortex. In addition it was expressed in scant quantity in the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, small intestine, and colon). Thyroid tissue expression of secretagogin was restricted to C-cells. Using a sandwich capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a detection limit of 6.5 pg/ml, considerable amounts of constitutively secreted protein could be measured in tissue culture supernatants of stably transfected RIN-5F and dog insulinoma (INS-H1) cell clones; however, in stably transfected Jurkat cells, the protein was only secreted upon CD3 stimulation. Functional analysis of transfected cell lines expressing secretagogin revealed an influence on calcium flux and cell proliferation. In RIN-5F cells, the antiproliferative effect is possibly due to secretagogin-triggered down-regulation of substance P transcription.

Pauls T. Schwaller B. Guidebook to the Calcium-binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, New York1996Google Scholar). Several subfamilies are found in different tissue types. The tissue distribution of individual Ca2+-binding proteins is often specific; the anatomic localization of calbindin d-28k is restricted to various loci within the nervous system (2Andressen C. Blumcke I. Celio M.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 271: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 3Baimbridge K.G. Celio M.R. Rogers J.H. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 303-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar), and the closely related calretinin is localized to central and peripheral neurons (4Resibois A. Rogers J.H. Neuroscience. 1992; 46: 101-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 5Winsky L. Kuznicki J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The biological role of these cytoplasmic Ca2+-binding proteins is poorly understood (6Heizmann C.W. Hunziker W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). These proteins share a unique tandem repeat of a Ca2+-binding loop flanked by two α helices known as the “EF-hand” Ca2+-binding site (1Celio R.C. Pauls T. Schwaller B. Guidebook to the Calcium-binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, New York1996Google Scholar). Calbindin d-28k (7Hunziker W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and calretinin (8Parmentier M. Lefort A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) possess six such EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites, which vary somewhat in Ca2+ binding affinity (9Gross M.D. Gosnell M. Tsarbopoulos A. Hunziker W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20917-20922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, calbindin d-28k and calretinin have been localized to chromosomes 8 and 16, respectively (10Parmentier M. Passage E. Vassart G. Mattei M.G. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1991; 57: 41-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The genomic structures of both proteins, which are highly evolutionarily conserved, have been elucidated and comprise 11 exons interrupted by 10 introns (11Celio R.C. Pauls T. Schwaller B.

A variety of cellular functions is triggered by cell surface receptor-ligand interactions followed by Ca2+ mobilization from Ca2+ storage pools within the endoplasmic reticulum. Cytosolic free Ca2+ binds to cytosolic molecules, as exemplified by calmodulin (14Means A.R. Dedman J.R. Nature. 1980; 285: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), which undergoes a conformational alteration in response to Ca2+ chelation (15Weinstein H. Mehler E.L. Annu. Rev.

Using a polyclonal antiserum to calbindin, this protein has been localized within the chicken pancreatic islet of Langerhans (31Roth J. Bonner Weir S. Norman A.W. Orci L. Meier T.J. Ho D.Y. Park T.S. Sapolsky R.M. Endocrinology. 1982; 110: 2216-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When stable transfectants of RIN-5F insulinoma cells were generated with neuronald-28k calbindin, a higher rate of insulin transcription and insulin secretion could be measured (32Reddy D. Pollock A.S. Clark S.A. Sooy K. Vasavada R.C. Stewart A.F. Honeyman T. Christakos S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, granins (granular packaging proteins) interact with adaptin in immature granules in a Ca2+-dependent fashion and thus calcium-binding proteins might play a more general role in secretory granule formation (33Ozawa H. Takata K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1995; 20: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have generated a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb)1 D24 against a human insulinoma (34Wagner L. Templ E. Reining G. Base W. Weissel M. Nowotny P. Kaserer K. Waldhäusl W. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 156: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which binds to virtually all cells present in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans and to all insulinomas tested. In addition, mAb D24 stains tumors originating from the gastrointestinal neuroendocrine system including vipomas, gastrinomas, and carcinoid tumors. In contrast, this mAb does not stain the exocrine pancreatic tissue (34Wagner L. Templ E. Reining G. Base W. Weissel M. Nowotny P. Kaserer K. Waldhäusl W. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 156: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Using this mAb we have screened a human pancreatic beta cell cDNA library and found three plaques reacting specifically with this antibody. Sequencing of all three gene inserts has revealed a unique mRNA sequence encoding a new Ca2+-binding protein related to calbindin d-28k and calretinin. In this study we also demonstrate that this protein is rather specifically expressed in the pancreas (islet of Langerhans) and to a very minor degree in the small intestine, colon, stomach, and (only very faintly) in thyroid and adrenal gland, organs known to contain neuroendocrine elements. In addition, we demonstrate certain functional properties of secretagogin including its influence on KCl-stimulated calcium flux in transfected RIN-5F cell clones, influence on gene expression in RIN-5F cell clones, and an inhibitory influence on the growth rate of Jurkat and RIN-5F transfectants. The human pancreatic beta cell library was generously provided by Dr. M. Alan Permutt (Islet Transplantation Center, Washington University, St. Louis, MO). A murine mAb (D24) was generated by using a human insulinoma as immunogen and selected by immunohistochemical staining of post mortem human pancreatic tissue (34Wagner L. Templ E. Reining G. Base W. Weissel M. Nowotny P. Kaserer K. Waldhäusl W. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 156: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This mAb was then used to immunoscreen the pancreatic beta cell library. Approximately 106 λgt11 phage were plated and incubated until the plaques were nearly confluent. The lawn was then treated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-soaked nitrocellulose (Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose membranes; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Amersham, United Kingdom) for 3.5 h. The filters were blocked with 10% skim milk, stained with mAb D24 (tissue culture supernatant), and developed with monospecific biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (45 min) and avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Three specifically recognized plaques were identified and plaque-purified. The inserts were PCR-amplified using a set of λgt11 flanking primers (4 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 cycles at 94 °C denaturation for 60 s, annealing at 55 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s). The PCR product was subcloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced by an automated sequencing system. All three plaques contained the same insert. The resultant sequence was compared with the GenBank™ nucleic acid data base. The DNA sequence and predicted protein sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTAW and MAXHOM Multiple sequence alignment and the SeqVu protein alignment programs, respectively. Multiple human tissue Northern blots were obtained fromCLONTECH. Hybridization was performed using the32P-labeled cDNA insert according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were washed and exposed to x-ray film at −70 °C for 12 h. The entire coding region of the human secretagogin gene was amplified by PCR using primers containing a BamHI site at the 5′-terminus and an EcoRI site at the 3′-terminus. Amplified cDNA was subsequently cut with EcoRI andBamHI and cloned into the pGEX-1λT (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) expression vector, which confers glutathioneS-transferase (GST) and a thrombin cleavage site at the N terminus of the inserted protein. The plasmid containing the PCR-generated insert was sequenced by an automated sequencing system to confirm the desired sequence of the fusion protein coding sequence. Recombinant Escherichia coli BL21 containing pGEX-1λT with the desired protein gene was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (100 mm final concentration) for 2 h. The bacteria were pelleted, suspended in ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sonicated until the cell suspension became translucent. After pelleting insoluble material, glutathione-Sepharose 4B slurry was added to the supernatant and mixed at room temperature for 5 min. The glutathione-Sepharose 4B was then pelleted and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Thrombin was added to the washed, loaded glutathione-Sepharose. The suspension was rotated at room temperature for 3 h, centrifuged, and the supernatant containing the cleaved secretagogin protein was harvested and frozen for further use. The secretagogin cDNA coding sequence was cloned into theBamHI-EcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pZeoSV2(+), which confers resistance to the antibiotic Zeocin. The ligated plasmid was used to transform E. coli INVαF′ to obtain adequate plasmid DNA for transfection. The plasmid was sequenced through the region of the cloning site to confirm its primary structure. COS cells were transiently transfected using a Lipofectin PerFectTM transfection kit (Invitrogen). DNA (10 μg) and Lipofectin (12 μl) were diluted to a combined volume of 2 ml and added to a monolayer of nearly confluent COS cells. The cells were incubated for 4 h with the transfection solution, which was then replaced with complete medium. After 24 h, the cells were washed in protein-free RPMI and incubated briefly with trypsin (0.25%) and EDTA (0.03%), and washed nonadherent cells were replated. At 72 h, the transfected cells were harvested by vigorous pipetting and loaded onto glass slides by cytocentrifuge for immunostaining. Logarithmically growing Jurkat cells were pelleted and resuspended in an electroporation cuvette (Gene Pulser Cuvettes; Bio-Rad) containing 800 μl of transfection buffer (21 mm Hepes, pH 7.05, 137 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm KCl, 6 mm glucose) and the engineered vector pZeoSV2 or a sham-engineered control vector. Cells were transfected using the Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) (280V, 960 μF) and then incubated for an additional 10 min at room temperature. The transfected cells were diluted and plated in 2-ml cultures and selected with Zeocin (500 μg/ml) after 24 h. RIN-5F cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-2058) and cultured in RPMI 1640 (10 mm glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, and 5% CO2. RIN-5F is a secondary clone of the rat islet tumor cell line RIN-m (ATCC CRL-2057). RIN-5F cells (1.5 × 106) were seeded into 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks and fed every 3 days. Cells were subcultured every 5–6 days using trypsin (0.25%) and EDTA (0.03%) in Hanks' buffered saline solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+. The insulinoma cell line INS-H1 was established from a dog pancreatic insulinoma (35Wagner L. Gartner W. Kaserer K. Waldhaeusl W. Diabetes Stoffwechsel. 1999; 8 Suppl. 1: 97Google Scholar) and cultured as indicated above for the rat insulinoma cell line RIN-5F. RIN-5F and INS-H1 cells were transfected using a Lipofectin PerFectTM transfection kit (Invitrogen). DNA (10 μg) and Lipofectin (12 μl) were diluted to a combined volume of 2 ml and added to a monolayer of nearly confluent cells. The cells were incubated for 4 h with the transfection solution, which was then replaced with complete medium. After a 30-h incubation, selection was started with 170 μg/ml Zeocin. After 14 days of selection, colonies were hand-picked under microscopic observation using sterile conditions and propagated in 24-well dishes. Highly expressing clones were identified by performing a secretagogin ELISA of the RIN-5F cell supernatant as well as cell lysate and by immunocytochemistry of the cells using mAb D24. RIN-5F cells (3 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into 12-well cluster culture plates; after a 48-h period for cell adherence, the supernatant was replaced by 1 ml of fresh prewarmed culture medium with and without 20 mmol/L KCl. After a 60-min incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a 98% humidified incubator, the supernatant was harvested and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to pellet cells and cell fragments, and the resultant supernatant was then stored in Minisorb tubes at −20 °C for insulin and secretagogin analysis. Similar experiments were carried out over a 10-h period in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks containing 2.5 × 106 cells and 5 ml of culture medium. All experiments were carried out in duplicate or triplicate samples. Briefly, air-dried, acetone-fixed cytospin slides (see below) were sequentially incubated with mAb D24, rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin, alkaline phosphatase murine anti-alkaline phosphatase complex, and finally with Fast Red/naphthol ASBI phosphate as the chromogenic substrate. In the PAP method, horseradish peroxidase murine anti-peroxidase (PAP) was used for detection of the antigen. The cell layer was then counterstained in hematoxylin and a coverslip was applied using Glycergel as mountant (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Aliquots of approximately 2 × 104 cells were loaded by cytocentrifuge onto glass slides. Air-dried (2 h), acetone-fixed (5 min) cytospin slides were blocked with 3% bovine serum in PBS and then incubated with mAb D24 (tissue culture supernatant) and rabbit polyclonal anti-insulin IgG (Cappel 11187; reactive with human, pig, and rat insulin) (final concentration 1:150) for 60 min. After two washes in PBS for 10 min, slides were incubated for 60 min in fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (both diluted 1:200) (Jackson Immunoresearch). Control slides containing nontransfected RIN-5F cells were incubated with nonimmune rabbit serum, mAb D24, and secondary antibodies as above. After staining, slides were washed in PBS and a drop of 1% n-propyl gallate (Sigma) was used to reduce photobleaching. All specimens were examined by confocal imaging using a Leica DM IRBE microscope and the Leica TCS 4D confocal system. Gentle homogenization conditions were chosen to limit possible breakage of endosomes and other granular compartments such as neuroendocrine secretory granules. A 75% confluent cell layer was washed with PBS twice and then scraped into 2.5 ml of PBS containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.8 mm Pefabloc). The scraped cell suspension was then centrifuged at 1000 rpm at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors as above). The cells were centrifuged again at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then resuspended in homogenization buffer as above containing 1 mm EDTA and doubled concentration of the protease inhibitors. The cell suspension was then drawn through a 22-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe five times, then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The post-nuclear supernatant was then centrifuged for 30 min at 55,000 rpm at 4 °C in a table-top Beckman centrifuge using the TL-100 rotor. The supernatant was collected as cytosol, and the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer. The protein content was determined in each fraction with a protein assay reagent (Pierce). Endogenous and transfected secretagogin were analyzed by loading aliquots of each cell suspension or cell fraction derived from RIN-5F cells and transfected derivatives onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoretically transferring the protein to nitrocellulose. The blotted filter was blocked with 10% skim milk and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-secretagogin serum, followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin, and further developed by BM chemiluminescent reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Vienna, Austria). To detect recombinant secretagogin, aliquots of whole cell extract of transformed E. coli BL21, and purified protein cleaved by thrombin from loaded glutathione-Sepharose were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels, run under reducing conditions, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Filters were incubated in mAb D24 supernatant and developed as described above (see immunoscreening). Fresh-frozen tissue samples stored in liquid nitrogen obtained from patients with pheochromocytoma (n = 1), adrenal adenoma (n = 1), carcinoid tumor (n = 4), neuroendocrine carcinoma (n = 2), insulinoma (n = 1), gastrinoma (n = 2), pancreatic tissue and Graves' disease (n = 1) were homogenized and mRNA was extracted according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar) using RNAzol (Cinna Biotecx, Houston, TX). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using AdvantageTM RT-for-PCR kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). cDNA (10 μl) was used as PCR template, and thermal cycling parameters were set to 30 cycles 94 °C (60 s) for denaturation, 55 °C (60 s) for annealing and 72 °C (60 s) for synthesis using gene-specific primers. The products were separated on a 1% agarose gel, and positive samples were cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by an automated sequencing system. Total RNA was isolated from homogenized tissue or in vitro grown cells with or without using RNAzol (Cinna Biotecx). RNA was size-fractionated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.7% formaldehyde, transferred to Hybond-Nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 10× SSC, and hybridized with a [32P]dCTP Klenow-labeled random primed probe and the GAPDH probe as a control for RNA loading. RNA was fixed to the membrane by UV cross-linking (Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The membrane was hybridized and washed under conditions of high stringency (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA, and 20 mm Tris at 42 °C). In some experiments, the 28 S ribosomal RNA oligonucleotide probe was used as a control for RNA loading (CLONTECH). The probe was labeled by the kinase reaction, and hybridization was conducted at 41 °C in 900 mmol/L NaCl, 180 mmol/L Tris-HCl, and 12 mmol/L EDTA overnight, followed by five washing steps (20 min each) at room temperature with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS (w/v). Recombinant secretagogin was prepared by expressing a secretagogin-GST fusion protein in E. coli. The recombinant secretagogin was purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography and thrombin cleavage to yield a single species of 32 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Purified recombinant secretagogin (540 μg) was emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into a 5-month-old male rabbit. Additional immunizations with 260 μg were administered on days 44 and 70 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Serum collected 1 month after the third immunization contained high titer antibody activity against the recombinant protein when tested by ELISA. Aliquots of D24 culture supernatant (100 μl) were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C in flat-bottomed 96-well Reacti-BindTM goat anti-mouse coated plates (Pierce). After a brief wash with PBS, 100 μl of biological fluid was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature under constant shaking. Serial dilutions of human recombinant secretagogin were included as standards in each experiment. The plate was washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 in an ELISA wash station (Dynatech, Denkendorf, Germany). Rabbit anti-human secretagogin antiserum (dilution 1:300) was then incubated for 1.5 h under constant shaking with a Behring shaker (Behring AG, Marburg, Germany) at room temperature. After four washes, the plate was incubated with polyclonal horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin diluted 1:10000 (Kirkegaard & Perry) in tissue culture medium and goat serum (3% v/v final concentration) for 1.5 h at room temperature under constant shaking. Wells were washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and developed using the TMB two-component peroxidase substrate solution (Kirkegaard & Perry). The reaction was stopped by adding 1m H3PO4 and quantitated by absorbance at 450 nm using a Dynatech ELISA reader. The insulin content was determined by a sensitive rat insulin RIA kit (Linco Research, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions or in some experiments by using the Pharmacia insulin RIA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a rat insulin standard. Insulin secretion experiments were carried out in triplicate at least five times using multiple passages (passages 3–7) of 10 different clones. Total RNA was extracted from clone RIN-5FB23, a stably secretagogin-transfected clone and clone RIN-5Ftr6, a sham transfectant. In brief, RNA isolation was performed using an Atlas pure total RNA isolation kit (CLONTECH). After DNase I treatment, RNA was further purified and precipitated and then the probe was prepared essentially as described in the manufacturer's instruction manual. cDNA synthesis was performed at 48 °C including [α-32P]dATP reaction buffer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. A column chromatography step was included to eliminate nonincorporated radioactivity. Hybridization of the atlas array was performed overnight at 68 °C. After stringent washes with 2× SSC, 1% SDS followed by 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS, membranes were exposed for autoradiography to Kodak XAR5-Omat films at −80 °C. RIN-5F cell clones were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/Petri dish in triplicate. Cells were harvested by trypsin-EDTA treatment and viable cells counted by hemocytometer using trypan blue after 72 and 120 h of incubation. Jurkat cells growing in suspension were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml in Falcon culture flasks in triplicate. Stably expressing secretagogin-transfected RIN-5F cells or wild type and sham transfectant controls (106/ml) were suspended in RPMI containing 1% fetal calf serum and 5.0 μm acetoxymethyl ester of Fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The tissue culture flask adherent cells were detached using trypsin-EDTA as indicated above. Detached Fura-2-loaded cells were washed with fresh culture medium in order to stop trypsin activity. Two further washes and all subsequent experiments were carried out in test buffer containing 145 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 25 mm Hepes, and 22 mmglucose. Cell aliquots (1.5 ml, 1 × 106/ml) were placed in a continuously stirring cuvette at 37 °C in a fluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Cytosolic calcium changes were determined after addition of the agonist KCl (20 mm final concentration) by monitoring the excitation fluorescence intensity emitted at 510 nm in response to sequential excitation at 340 and 380 nm (37Garcia Zepeda E.A. Combadiere C. Rothenberg M.E. Sarafi M.N. Lavigne F. Hamid Q. Murphy P.M. Luster A.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5613-5626PubMed Google Scholar). Data are presented as the increase of intracellular calcium [Ca]i after addition of the agonist. [Ca]i was calculated according to the formula [Ca]i=Kd[(R −R min)/(R max −R)], assuming a K d of 224 nm, and R represents the fluorescence ratio at 340 and 380 nm after adding the agonist. R maxindicates the amount of calcium increase after detergent lysis, andR min reflects the fluorescence ratio F340/F380 nm after calcium chelation using EDTA. RIN-5F cells (3 × 105/ml, 1 ml) or stably expressing RIN-5F transfectants were seeded onto round (r = 1.2 cm) glass coverslips in six-well cluster tissue culture dishes, fed with 1 ml of culture medium after 24 h, and incubated in total for 48 h prior to use"

GCN5 is a member of a large family of histone acetyltransferases that are conserved between yeast and humans. To understand the molecular mechanisms of histone/protein acetylation, a detailed kinetic analysis was performed. Bi-substrate kinetic analysis using acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) and an H3 histone synthetic peptide indicated that both substrates must bind to form a ternary complex before catalysis. Product inhibition studies revealed that the product CoA was a competitive inhibitor versus AcCoA. Desulfo-CoA, a dead-end inhibitor, also demonstrated simple competitive inhibition versus AcCoA. Acetylated (Lys14Ac) H3 peptide displayed noncompetitive inhibition against both H3 peptide and AcCoA. These results support a sequential ternary complex (ordered Bi-Bi) kinetic mechanism, where AcCoA binds first, followed by H3 histone. Acetylated (Lys14Ac) H3 product is released first, and CoA is the last product to leave. Also, two methods were developed to measure the binding affinities of AcCoA/CoA for GCN5. Employing the fluorescent CoA analog etheno-CoA (εCoA, 1-N 6-etheno-CoA), aK d for εCoA of 5.1 ± 1.1 μmwas determined by fluorescence anisotropy. This value was similar to the K d value of 8.5 ± 2.6 μmfor AcCoA obtained using equilibrium dialysis and to theK i (inhibition constant) of 6.7 μmfor CoA obtained from steady-state kinetic assays. Together, these data suggest that the acetyl moiety of AcCoA contributes little to the binding energy.

GCN5 was originally identified as a transcriptional activator that was necessary to promote maximal levels of GCN4-dependent transcription (1.Georgakopoulos T. Thireos G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4145-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). AcCoA+histone H3 ⇄yGCN5 CoA+acetylated histone H3 SCHEME 1Recent reports have demonstrated that the acetylation of specific lysine side chains in the amino termini of core histones plays a crucial role in the transcriptional activation of specific target genes (2.Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 3.Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem.

The yeast GCN5 (yGCN5) HAT shows a strong preference for acetylation of lysine 14 of histone H3 in vitro with reported broader specificity in vivo. In vivo yGCN5 has been reported to acetylate lysine 9 and 18 of histone H3, residues 8 and 16 of histone H4, and lysine residues in the amino-terminal tail of histone H2B, albeit to a much lesser degree than lysine 14 of histone H3 (5.Grant P.A.

Turner B.M. Roth S.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3155-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Models have been proposed in which these site-specific acetylations in the amino termini of histones lead to altered nucleosomal chromatin structure by disrupting histone-DNA contacts and histone-histone contacts (7.Hansen J.C. Tse C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Enrichment of acetylation on specific lysine residues suggests that differential acetylation within distinct chromatin loci may play a key role in transcriptional regulation (2.Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 3.Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem.

Several classes of HATs have been identified: p300/CBP (8.Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar) cytosolic HAT 1 (9.Dutnall R.N.

Among HAT enzymes, yGCN5, which is a P/CAF family member, has been the most thoroughly characterized. yGCN5 is typically found in two high molecular mass complexes, SAGA (1.8 MDa) and Ada (0.8 MDa). The SAGA complex activates transcription by association with acidic activation domains of various transcription factors and results in the acetylation of nucleosomal histones H3 and H2B (13.Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). The Ada complex has also been shown to acetylate nucleosomal histone H3 and histone H2B (14.Eberharter A. Sterner D.E. Schieltz D. Hassan A. Yates J.R.R. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6621-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Recently, several crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) molecular models have been solved for the catalytic domains of yGCN5, P/CAF, and a Tetrahymena homologue (p55) of yGCN5 (15.Clements A. Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Wang L. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3521-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16.Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Zhou J. Mo Y. Li X. Berger S.L.

Nature. 1999; 400: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These structures demonstrated that the high degree of sequence homology between these enzymes is manifested by a similar overall structure. The binary complex of P/CAF·CoA and the ternary complex ofTetrahymena p55·CoA·H3 peptide revealed that residues contacting CoA in the active site are highly conserved. In addition, a biochemical study (18.Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.H. Howard R.M. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) of yGCN5 enzymatic activity implicated the conserved glutamic acid 173 as a general base catalyst in the GCN5 HAT reaction, deprotonating the ε-amino group of lysine 14 in histone H3. Elucidating the mechanism of HAT catalysis will provide a basis for understanding the link between histone acetylation and gene activation. In this study we have systematically determined the overall kinetic mechanism, developed methods for measuring substrate/product binding affinities (fluorescence anisotropy and equilibrium dialysis), and determined the order of substrate binding and the order of product release by employing the product inhibitors CoA and acetylated (Lys14Ac) H3 peptide and the dead-end inhibitor desulfo-CoA. The results are consistent with a fully ordered Bi-Bi kinetic mechanism, where AcCoA is the first substrate to bind, and CoA is the last product released. All chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Histone H3 peptide, ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPPKQLC, and the corresponding acetylated H3 peptide (Lys14Ac), corresponding to the 20 amino-terminal residues of human histone H3 and an additional carboxyl-terminal cysteine, were synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Core Lab at The Baylor College of Medicine. Acetyl-CoA was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Calf thymus histones were purchased from Calbiochem. [3H]Acetyl-CoA (1.88 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Sciences Products. P81 phosphocellulose disks were from Life Technologies, Inc. Dispo-Equilibrium Dialyzers were from Amika Corp. εCoA, 1-N 6-etheno-CoA was from Sigma. All other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher. The catalytic domain (amino acids 99–262) of yGCN5 was recombinantly expressed by isopropyl-B- d-thiogalactopyranoside induction for 12 h at 25 °C and purified from BL21-DE3 bacteria as described previously (18.Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.H. Howard R.M. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 19.Kim Y. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After cation exchange chromatography on S-Sepharose, fractions (assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were pooled and concentrated and then subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on G-75 Sephadex. Purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and fractions were concentrated and stored at −20 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (20.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). yGCN5 histone acetyltransferase activity was monitored continuously using a Multiskan Ascent microplate reader (LabSystems, Franklin, MA) as described previously (19.Kim Y. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, the CoASH generated in the HAT reactions was continuously measured by using a coupled enzyme system with pyruvate dehydrogenase. The CoASH-dependent oxidation of pyruvate was accompanied by the reduction of NAD to NADH, which was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (ε340NADH = 6220m−1cm−1). The HAT assay reaction mixtures (70 μl) contained 0.2 mm NAD, 0.2 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2.4 mm pyruvate, and 0.03 units of pyruvate dehydrogenase (1 unit of dehydrogenase is defined by the manufacturer (Sigma) to be the conversion of 1.0 μmol of β-NAD to β-NADH/min at pH 7.4 at 30 °C). The assay buffer was 100 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm Bis-Tris, and 50 mm Tris and pH 7.5. All assays were performed at 25 °C and were initiated by the addition of yGCN5. The rates were analyzed continuously for up to 5 min, and background rates resulting from the spontaneous formation of CoA were subtracted from the initial velocities derived from the yGCN5-catalyzed reactions. Under these conditions, the coupled enzyme reaction does not limit the observed initial velocities (19.Kim Y. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Also, only the linear portion of the kinetic traces were used to determine the initial rates. These were typically linear for up to 5 min. Stock solutions of the H3 peptide or acetylated (Lys14Ac) H3 peptide were prepared fresh daily in the presence of 5 mmdithiothreitol. Alternatively, yGCN5 activity was measured using [3H]AcCoA, the P81-filter binding assay as described previously (18.Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.H. Howard R.M. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The Bi-substrate kinetic analysis was performed at AcCoA concentrations spanning 1–20 μm and H3 peptide or calf thymus histone concentrations spanning 25–730 μm. The yGCN5 HAT activity was monitored via the coupled-enzyme spectrophotometric assay using either pyruvate dehydrogenase or α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The data were fitted to three possible kinetic mechanisms: the sequential (ternary complex) mechanism equation (Equation 1), the ping-pong (covalent intermediate) mechanism equation (Equation 2), and the equilibrium-ordered equation (Equation 3), using the algorithms of Cleland (21.Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 273-387PubMed Google Scholar) and the computer program KinetAsyst (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA) and a nonlinear least squares analysis. v=Vm×[A]×[B]/((Kia×Kb)+(Kma×[B])Equation 1 +(Kmb×[A])+([A]×[B])) v=Vm×[A]×[B]/((Ka×[B])+(Kb×[A])+([A]×[B]))Equation 2 v=Vm×[A]×[B]/((Ka×Kb)+(Kb×[A])+([A]×[B]))Equation 3 The product inhibitors CoA and acetylated (Lys14Ac) H3 peptide, as well as the substrate analog desulfo-CoA (lacking only the terminal sulfhydryl of CoA) were used in steady-state inhibition studies. To investigate whether competitive (Equation 4), noncompetitive (Equation 5), or uncompetitive (Equation6) inhibition was observed, the data were fitted to the respective inhibition equations based on the algorithms defined by Cleland (21.Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 273-387PubMed Google Scholar) using a nonlinear least squares analysis. v=Vm×[S]/[Km(1+I/[Kis)+[S]]Equation 4 v=Vm×[S]/[Km(1+I/Kis)+[S](1+I/Kii)]Equation 5 v=Vm×[S]/[Km+[S](1+I/Kii)]Equation 6 Equilibration was performed using Dispo-Equilibrium Dialyzers (Amika Corp.), which contains two 75-μl chambers separated by a 5-kDa cut-off dialysis membrane. Equilibration conditions were 50 mm Tris, 50 mm Bis-Tris, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.5, and 32.5 μm yGCN5. The K d value for AcCoA in the presence of yGCN5 was determined by transferring 10–400 μm AcCoA (20–40 cpm 3H/pmol) into the buffer chamber and yGCN5 into the sample chamber. After 48 h of equilibration on a level shaker, samples were recovered from each chamber and counted by liquid scintillation to determine the amount of radioactivity in the buffer chamber ([AcCoA]free) and the sample chamber ([AcCoA]free + [AcCoA·yGCN5]). The calculated [AcCoA]free was subsequently subtracted from the calculated concentration [AcCoA]free + [AcCoA·yGCN5] to determine the concentration of bound AcCoA. The data were presented in hyperbolic form (Equation 7). [AcCoA·yGCN5]=([yGCN5] tot·[AcCoA] free)/(Kd+[AcCoA] free)Equation 7 εCoA was titrated with increasing [yGCN5]. [εCoA] was determined spectrophotometrically by using a molar extinction coefficient of 5.6 mm−1cm−1 at 275 nm. The anisotropy measurements were performed on a Photon Technologies QM-1 steady-state fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostat. εCoA was excited at 305 nm (3-nm slits), and emission was monitored at 405 nm with 20-nm slits for both the parallel and perpendicular components. Measurements were performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 °C, using a 200-μl quartz cuvette. A concentrated solution of yGCN5 (in 1-μl increments) was added to the cuvette containing 0.5 μm εCoA and mixed using a small magnetic stirring bar. Anisotropy increases were measured after 1–2 min. The anisotropy r of εCoA was calculated from the parallel Ivv and perpendicularIvh polarized fluorescence intensities measured upon parallel excitation according to Equation 8, r=(Ivv−G·Ivh)/(Ivv+2·G·Ivh)Equation 8 where G is the ratio of the parallel Ivhand perpendicular Ivh polarized fluorescence intensity measured upon parallel excitation to correct for the different efficiencies of the parallel and perpendicular polarization fluorescence detectors. Data were fitted to Equation 9 described in Richards et al. (22.Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), A=((Abound−Afree)·[yGCN5]/Kd+[yGCN5])+AfreeEquation 9 where A is the anisotropy measured at a given concentration of yGCN5, and A free andA bound are the anisotropies of free and bound εCoA, respectively. This simplified equation can be used when the dissociation constant is ≥10-fold higher than the fluorescent ligand concentration, since the concentration of yGCN5 bound to εCoA becomes negligible in comparison to the total yGCN5 concentration (22.Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Given the highly charged characteristic of the nucleosomal complex, it is likely that ionic strength will greatly influence the catalytic activity of these enzymes. Therefore, the effect of ionic strength on the yGCN5 HAT reaction was examined by varying NaCl concentrations between 0 and 1 m, and the resulting HAT activity was monitored in the radioactive P81-filter binding assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resulting yGCN5 activity was plotted versus the log of the ionic strength and fitted to a line using least squares analysis (Fig.1). A direct linear relationship between the log of the ionic strength and inactivation of yGCN5 HAT activity was observed. There was an approximate 7-fold decrease of yGCN5 HAT activity between 0.15 m NaCl and 1 m NaCl. Yeast GCN5 catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl moiety from AcCoA to the ε-amino side chain of Lys 14 of histone H3 (Scheme 1). It was first necessary to determine the basic kinetic mechanism (sequential or ping-pong) utilized by yGCN5 before a detailed investigation into the order of substrate binding and the order of product release could be performed. CoA-dependent transferases are known to utilize one of two distinct mechanisms to catalyze acetyl group transfer. One mechanism involves acetyl transfer from CoA to an enzyme side chain nucleophile before transfer to the amine substrate (23.Thompson S. Mayerl F. Peoples O.P. Masamune S. Sinskey A.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5735-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a subsequent step, the enzyme then transfers this acetyl group to the acceptor amine substrate. The alternative mechanism involves direct acetyl transfer from AcCoA to the amine substrate acceptor without the formation of a covalent enzyme intermediate (24.Lewendon A. Murray I.A. Shaw W.V. Gibbs M.R. Leslie A.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The latter mechanism requires that both substrates and enzyme must form a ternary complex before catalysis can occur. In a previous study (18.Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.H. Howard R.M. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) we performed a Bi-substrate kinetic analysis with core histone proteins (H3, H2A, H2B, and H4) derived from calf thymus and demonstrated that yGCN5 utilizes a sequential (ternary complex) mechanism. Here, a synthetic H3 peptide (ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPPKQLC) was employed as a substrate in lieu of calf thymus histones since this substrate provides a better defined system to analyze the steady-state kinetic parameters. To distinguish between a ternary complex (sequential) mechanism and a ping-pong (covalent-intermediate) mechanism, initial velocity steady-state kinetic parameters were obtained for AcCoA and H3 peptide using AcCoA concentrations spanning 1–20 μm and H3 peptide concentrations spanning 25–730 μm. Analysis of these data by plotting 1/velocity against 1/[H3 peptide] at different fixed concentrations of AcCoA resulted in an intersecting line pattern (Fig. 2) that is characteristic of a ternary complex (sequential) mechanism. In contrast, a ping-pong (covalent intermediate) mechanism is typically characterized by a parallel line pattern. The identification of a ternary complex was consistent with our previously published report (18.Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.H. Howard R.M. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) using a histone preparation derived from calf thymus, thus validating the use of H3 peptide as an excellent analog of histone protein. The basic steady-state parameters derived from this Bi-substrate analysis are summarized in Table I. Employing acetylated (Lys14Ac) synthetic H3 peptide as a substrate for yGCN5, it was determined that lysine 14 of H3 peptide is the only residue of H3 peptide acetylated. No other Lysine (Lys-4, Lys-9, or Lys-18) of H3 peptide was found to be acetylated above background levels when using either the radioactive P81-filter binding assay or the coupled enzyme spectrophotometric assay (data not shown). This is an important result since acetylation at a secondary site to lysine 14 of H3 peptide would significantly complicate the initial velocity kinetic analysis.Table ISummary of kinetic and equilibrium constants for yeast GCN5 HATSubstratesK mk cat/K mk catAcCoA2.5 ± 1.4 μm aExperiments were performed in triplicate.

Our previous study (18.Tanner K.G. Trievel R.C. Kuo M.H. Howard R.M. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) combined with the Bi-substrate analysis described above have strongly argued against a ping-pong (covalent intermediate) type mechanism and demonstrated that yGCN5 followed a sequential Bi-Bi mechanism. The binding of substrates and release of products can be random, fully ordered, or a combination of both. Product inhibition studies can easily distinguish among the various possibilities. To distinguish among the various possible kinetic models for substrate binding and product release, the products of the yGCN5-catalyzed HAT reaction were used to inhibit the yGCN5-catalyzed HAT reaction. To correctly analyze product inhibition data, the reversibility of the yGCN5-catalyzed reaction was examined. This was accomplished by a high performance liquid chromatography assay using reversed phase chromatography to directly monitor the formation of deacetylated H3 peptide from a reaction of yGCN5, CoA, and acetylated (Lys14Ac) H3 peptide. Analysis of the time points from a reaction carried out at pH 7.5 and 25 °C with high concentrations of acetylated (Lys14Ac) H3 peptide and CoA with a corresponding non-enzyme control were subjected to reversed phase chromatography. The estimated turnover number under this set of conditions (1.0 mm CoA, 1.0 mm acetylated (Lys14Ac) H3 peptide) was 0.00002 s−1, ∼100,000-fold lower than thek cat value (1.7 s−1) determined for the forward reaction under saturating substrates. Thus, yGCN5 is capable of being a histone deacetylase as is predicted from thermodynamics, albeit much less efficiently. Products of the yGCN5-catalyzed HAT reaction are classified as competitive inhibitors if increasing concentrations of product decrease the apparent k cat/K m for the varied substrate, uncompetitive if they decrease the apparentk cat, and noncompetitive if they decrease both. Evaluation of the patterns are obtained by observing increases in the slopes (apparent K m/k cat), the intercepts (apparent 1/k cat), or both, respectively, for lines in double-reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/[S] obtained at increasing concentrations of product (and a constant concentration of the second substrate). CoA was evaluated as a product inhibitor against both AcCoA and H3 peptide. The experiment was performed using the radioactive P81-filter binding assay since CoA itself is a substrate for the coupled enzyme in the spectrophotometric assay (19.Kim Y. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Initial velocities were determined, and the data were plotted in double-reciprocal form with 1/velocity versus1/[AcCoA] at several fixed concentrations of CoA. A series of double-reciprocal straight line plots intersected on the 1/velocity ordinate, indicating a competitive inhibition mechanism. This indicates that at high concentrations of AcCoA, the inhibition by CoA is overcome, and the V max values approach identical levels. CoA was found to be a linear competitive inhibitor (Fig.3) versus AcCoA at 100 μm H3 peptide, with a K is of 6.7 ± 5.1 μm, similar to the value obtained for (Fig. 2) theK m for AcCoA (4.5 ± 3.6 μm). The replot of the slopes from the double-reciprocal plot as a function of [CoA] was linear and yielded similar inhibition constants (analysis not shown). These data indicated that AcCoA and CoA compete for the same form of yGCN5 and the same mutually exclusive binding site. In a sequential mechanism involving two substrates and two products, this requires that AcCoA and CoA bind to free enzyme; thus, AcCoA is the first substrate to add, and CoA is the last product to leave. In a complimentary experiment, CoA did not inhibit against H3 peptide when AcCoA was present at saturating levels (data not shown). These results are consistent with CoA and H3 peptide binding to different forms of yGCN5 and are consistent with the kinetic mechanism in which AcCoA binds first, followed by binding of H3 peptide and subsequent transfer of the acetyl group from AcCoA to H3 and an ordered release of products with acetylated (Lys14Ac) H3 peptide releasing before the release of CoA (Scheme FS2).Figure FS2Proposed kinetic mechanism of yGCN5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further demonstrate that H3 peptide and core histones operate through the same kinetic mechanism, CoA inhibition studies were carried out using calf thymus core histones as the amine nucleophile substrate (Fig. 4). As with H3 peptide (Fig. 3), CoA is a pure competitive inhibitor against AcCoA when calf thymus core histones are used. Again, this indicated that AcCoA is the first substrate to add, and CoA is the last product to be released. By default, H3 peptide binds second and acetylated (Lys14Ac) H3 peptide is the first to leave. The inhibition constants for CoA are summarized in Table I. Taken together with the fact that k catvalues are similar between the two sources of substrate (k cat(H3) = 1.7 s−1,k cat(histones) = 0.74 s−1) and that both substrates (H3 peptide and calf thymus histones) generate intersecting line patterns in Bi-substrate kinetics, this strongly suggests that H3 peptide and core histones follow the same kinetic mechanism. To further establish that CoA acts as a pure competitive inhibitor, we utilized the CoA derivative desulfo-CoA in steady-state inhibition studies. Desulfo-CoA (which lacks only the terminal sulfhydryl of CoA) is a dead-end inhibitor since it forms a non-productive complex with yGCN5 and H3 peptide. Initial velocities were obtained, and the data were plotted in double-reciprocal form with 1/velocity versus 1/[AcCoA] at several fixed concentrations of desulfo-CoA. Desulfo-CoA was found to be a linear competitive inhibitor"
https://openalex.org/W2041578875,"p23 is a co-chaperone for the heat shock protein, hsp90. This protein binds hsp90 and participates in the folding of a number of cell regulatory proteins, but its activities are still unclear. We have solved a crystal structure of human p23 lacking 35 residues at the COOH terminus. The structure reveals a disulfide-linked dimer with each subunit containing eight β-strands in a compact antiparallel β-sandwich fold. In solution, however, p23 is primarily monomeric and the dimer appears to be a minor component. Conserved residues are clustered on one face of the monomer and define a putative surface region and binding pocket for interaction(s) with hsp90 or protein substrates. p23 contains a COOH-terminal tail that is apparently less structured and is unresolved in the crystal structure. This tail is not needed for the binding of p23 to hsp90 or to complexes with the progesterone receptor. However, the tail is necessary for optimum active chaperoning of the progesterone receptor, as well as the passive chaperoning activity of p23 in assays measuring inhibition of heat-induced protein aggregation."

Three mutations at these two sites (D98N, H255D, and H255N) result in large reductions in activity relative to native NIR, suggesting that both residues are involved intimately in the reaction mechanism. Crystal structures of these mutants have been determined using data collected to better than 1.9-Å resolution. In the native structure, His-255 Nε2 forms a hydrogen bond through a bridging water molecule to the side chain of Asp-98, which also forms a hydrogen bond to a water or nitrite oxygen ligated to the active site copper. In the D98N mutant, reorientation of the Asn-98 side chain results in the loss of the hydrogen bond to the copper ligand water, consistent with a negatively charged Asp-98 directing the binding and protonation of nitrite in the native enzyme. An additional solvent molecule is situated between residues 255 and the bridging water in the H255N and H255D mutants and likely inhibits nitrite binding.

Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). NIR is a key enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in this pathway (2Averill B.A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2951-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The catalytic function of NIR is to catalyze the one electron reduction of nitrite (NO2−) to nitric oxide (NO) under anaerobic conditions (3Kakutani T. Watanabe H. Arima K. Beppu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 89: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In vitro, N2O is also produced from the close homologue Achromobacter cycloclastesNIR (AcNIR), if NO is not removed from the reaction (4Jackson M.A. Tiedje J.M. Averill B.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The in vivo electron donor to A. faecalis S-6 NIR (AfNIR) is pseudoazurin, a small blue copper protein that belongs to the cupredoxin family of electron transfer proteins (3Kakutani T. Watanabe H.

Crystallographic analysis of NIR has revealed a structure of three identical 37-kDa subunits, each of which contains 343 amino acids folded into two β barrel domains (6Godden J.W. Turley S.

Beppu T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5246-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Each NIR monomer contains one type I and one type II copper site that are differentiated by their respective spectroscopic signatures. The type I blue copper atoms are buried within the N-terminal domains, and each one is coordinated by four amino acid residues (His-95, 2The amino acid numbering is that of AcNIR based on the sequence alignment by Nishiyama et al. (21Nishiyama M. Suzuki J. Kukimoto M. Ohnuki T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cys-136, His-145, and Met-150). The histidine and cysteine residues coordinate the type I copper in a distorted trigonal planar geometry with the methionine forming a weaker interaction at the axial position. Three mononuclear type II coppers are located at the interface between the subunits and are ligated by a water and three histidines (His-100, His-135, and His-306). His-100 and His-135 are provided by the N-terminal domain of one subunit, whereas His-306 is derived from the C-terminal domain of an adjacent subunit. The type I and II copper centers are approximately 12 Å apart and are connected covalently through Cys-136, a type I ligand, and His-135, a type II ligand. Crystallographic, spectroscopic, and functional studies of NIR from several species have revealed that the type I copper center is the site of electron transfer and the type II copper is the site of nitrite reduction (7Kukimoto M.

Analysis of the crystal structure of AcNIR suggested that two residues, Asp-98 and His-255, which are observed to be close but not ligating to the type II copper, participate in the reaction mechanism (6Godden J.W. Turley S. Teller D.C. Adman E.T. Liu M.Y. Payne W.J. LeGall J. Science. 1991; 253: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Structures derived from nitrite-soaked oxidized crystals of both native AcNIR and AfNIR reveal that nitrite bound asymmetrically via the oxygen atoms (10Adman E.T. Godden J.W. Turley S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28455-28460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Structures using ascorbate-reduced crystals of native AfNIR revealed a loss of the ligand water, and the subsequent addition of nitrite at low temperature showed weaker nitrite binding (11Murphy M.E.P. Turley S. Adman E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28455-28460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These crystallographic observations are consistent with nitrite binding preferably to the oxidized enzyme. In the nitrite-bound structures, the side-chain carboxylate of Asp-98 is observed to form a direct hydrogen bond to the oxygen atom of the nitrite ligand, suggesting a direct role in protonation of intermediates in the reaction pathway. The role of His-255 in the reaction is more controversial. Early modeling by Strange et al. (15Strange R.W. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H.L. Grossman J.G. Brüser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) suggested that bound nitrite may be hydrogen-bonded to His-255, enabling a direct proton transfer by this residue during catalysis. His-255 has been suggested to also donate a proton indirectly to reaction intermediates via a proton shuttling pathway using the bridging water to Asp-98 (10Adman E.T. Godden J.W. Turley S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27458-27474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A mutation to glutamate of the residue equivalent to His-255 in RsNIR suggested that this residue may be important in electrostatic stabilization of nitrite binding (16Olesen K. Veselov A. Zhao Y. Wang Y. Danner B. Scholes C.P. Shapleigh J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6086-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Additional insight into the mechanism has come from structural comparisons of the active sites of copper-containingA. xylosoxidans NIR (AxNIR) and AfNIR to the zinc sites in superoxide dismutase (SOD), thermolysin, astacin, and carbonic anhydrase (11Murphy M.E.P.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12107-12117Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The common structural motif of carbonic anhydrase, astacin, and NIR is a metal site with three protein ligands, a fourth distal ligand water, and a proton-abstracting group (a carboxyl or hydroxyl group) forming a hydrogen bond to the ligand water (15Strange R.W. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H.L. Grossman J.G. Brüser T. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Asp-98 in AfNIR is structurally analogous to the proton-abstracting residues found in the zinc-containing enzymes, suggesting a related role for this residue. A catalytic role for His-255 has been suggested from a comparison to the SOD copper center that is ligated by four histidine ligands in a plane and a water molecule in the apical position (18Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Beem B.K. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of the reduced yeast SOD (19Ogihara N.L. Parge H.E. Hart P.J. Weiss M.S. Goto J.J. Crane B.R. Tsang J. Slater K. Roe J.A. Valentine J.S. Eisenberg D. Tainer J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2316-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) demonstrates a structural rearrangement following protonation of a histidine ligand (His-63) resulting in a more tetrahedral coordination of the copper similar to that found in AxNIR (14Strange R.W. Murphy L.M. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As a result, His-63 adopts a position structurally analogous to His-249 in AxNIR and His-255 in AfNIR. Interestingly, SOD activity has been observed previously in NIR fromRhodopseudomonas sphaeroides (20Michalski W.P. Nicholas D.J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 828: 130-137Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and is localized at the type II copper center in AxNIR (14Strange R.W. Murphy L.M. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Together, these findings show an important catalytic role for His-63 in SOD and are suggestive of a similar role for the His-255 analogue in AfNIR. Here we report the crystallographic, spectroscopic, and functional characterization of mutants of two key residues, Asp-98 and His-255, in the active site of NIR from A. faecalis S-6. Nitrite reduction activity assays of these mutants show that both Asp-98 and His-255 are essential for high level NIR activity. Furthermore, analysis of the high resolution crystal structures of these mutants demonstrates a direct proton donation role for Asp-98, whereas His-255 is likely responsible for indirectly providing a proton during catalysis and directing the binding of nitrite to the active site. The new information gained from investigation of these mutants has led to a revision of the mechanistic model of NIR catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis of the AfNIR gene (21Nishiyama M. Suzuki J. Kukimoto M. Ohnuki T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was carried out using synthetic oligonucleotides as described by Kukimoto et al. (7Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Murphy M.E.P. Turley S. Adman E.T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5246-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The mutagenic primer used for the D98N mutant was 5′ CTG ATG CAT AAT ATC AAT TTC CAT GCG 3′ and incorporates an EcoT22I restriction endonuclease site. The primer for the H255D mutant was 5′ CGC GAT ACG CGT CCA GAT CTG ATC GGG 3′ and encodes an internal MluI cleavage site. A similar primer was used for the H255N mutant with the exception that the GAT codon for His-255 was changed to AAT. Mutations were confirmed with M13 dideoxy nucleotide sequencing (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). To increase expression levels, mutants were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned downstream of a T7 promoter in-frame with a C-terminal His tag. Nickel affinity chromatography was used to isolate the protein to a purity of >95% as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The histidine tag was removed with a Factor Xa digest overnight followed by passing the digested sample over a High Q anion exchange column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). A final dialysis step against Tris buffer, pH 7.0, supplemented with 10–50 mm copper resulted in full occupation of the copper sites as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Yields of purified AfNIR mutants were approximately 35–45 mg/liter of culture. The recombinant AfNIR produced by this procedure begins at residue Ala-4 and includes an extra four residues at the C terminus (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) that are part of the Factor Xa cleavage sequence. Samples of native AfNIR and the D98N, H255N, and H255D mutants in 10 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, were prepared to a concentration of 2 μm, prior to injection onto a reverse-phase column interfaced to an electrospray mass spectrometer. The protein was eluted with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile, pH 2.0, and injected directly into the carrier stream (90% acetonitrile/water) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min into a PE-Sciex API 300 quadrupole mass spectrometer. The copper content of native AfNIR and the three mutant forms was measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy with a copper detection lamp at a wavelength of 327.4 nm. A standard curve was generated using 12.5, 25, and 50 parts per billion copper standards made up in 2% nitric acid. AfNIR samples were diluted in 2% nitric acid, and duplicate 15-μl samples were injected into the furnace via an autosampler. The concentration of copper in the AfNIR samples was interpolated from the standard curve, and the molar ratio of copper was calculated using protein concentration values determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using a bovine serum albumin standard. Optical scanning spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Cary 3E UV-visible spectrophotometer fitted with a thermostated circulating water bath. Protein samples were analyzed in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0. EPR spectra were recorded at X-band frequencies on a Bruker ESP 300E electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer equipped with a Hewlett-Packard Model 532B frequency counter. For liquid helium spectra (19.5 K) the EPR instrument was fitted with an Oxford Instruments Model 900 continuous flow helium cryostat and an ITC4 temperature controller. Liquid nitrogen spectra were collected at 87 K. AfNIR samples were concentrated to approximately 1 mm, and buffer was exchanged with 10 mm MES and 40 mmKPO4, pH 7.2. Parameters used for data collection at 19.5 K were: modulation frequency 100,000 kHz, modulation amplitude 6.428 G, microwave frequency 9.450 GHz, and microwave power 0.3975 milliwatt (mW). A modulation amplitude of 0.708 G and a microwave power of 1.992 mW were used for data collected at 87 K. Nitrite reductase activity was measured at 30 °C as described by Kakutani et al. (5Kakutani T. Watanabe H. Arima K. Beppu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 89: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Methylviologen reduced with an excess of dithionite buffered in 100 mm sodium bicarbonate was used as the electron donor to NIR, which in turn catalyzes the one-electron reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide. The starting solution contains 2 mm sodium nitrite, 0.1 mm methylviologen, 5 mmdithionite, and 20 mm KPO4 buffer (pH 7.0). NIR was added such that the final nitrite concentration was between 0.5 and 1.4 mm after 20 min. Residual nitrite was determined using the Griess reagents, and for the control, 1.8 mm nitrite remained. Units are defined as the amount of NIR required to reduce 1 μmol of NO2− per minute. All three mutants crystallized in similar conditions; 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, 10–15% polyethylene glycol 4000, 6000, or 8000, and either zinc salt (D98N, H255N: 50–75 mm) or cadmium salt (H255D: 50 mm) at pH 4.7. The protein concentration used was 10–15 mg/ml. X-ray diffraction data from the mutants were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS IIc image plate system using CuKα radiation generated by a Rigaku RU 300 rotating anode generator and a graphite monochromator. Data sets were collected at a temperature of 15–20 °C. The diffraction data frames were exposed for 35–40 min with a crystal oscillation angle of 0.75° and were processed with the program DENZO (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The starting model used in refinement of the D98N mutant was chain A of the 1.8-Å resolution nitrite-soaked native AfNIR structure (11Murphy M.E.P. Turley S. Adman E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28455-28460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) after removal of the solvent atoms, nitrite, and the side chain of residue 98. The D98N mutant structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE (25Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and refined to a resolution of 1.9-Å by the maximum likelihood method using the program CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P., R.W., G.-K. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Rice L.M. Simonson T. G. L., W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The D98N structure was then used as the starting model for the H255D structure that was subsequently used to solve the H255N structure. Initially, refinement of the H255N and H255D structures did not yield a free R-factor below 30%. A self-rotation function showed that 2-fold symmetry was present perpendicular to the crystallographic 3-fold axis. Submission of the reflection data to the Merohedral Crystal Twinning web server (27Yeates T.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) confirmed that these crystals are indeed twinned. The H255N and H255D data sets were corrected using the program DETWIN from the CCP4 suite (28Collaborative Computational Project, NActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), and subsequent refinement reduced the free R-factor to below 22%. Manual intervention was accomplished using the visualization program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and the program PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) was used to identify regions of the structure requiring manual fitting. Refinement statistics for the final coordinate sets are presented in Table I. Amplification of the genes carrying native and mutant forms of AfNIR followed by cloning into a T7 promoter expression vector produced stable genetic constructs. Recombinant native AfNIR isolated from this expression construct is within 5 Da of the calculated mass following cleavage of the N-terminal methionine residue as measured by mass spectrometry (Table II). The observed mass difference for each mutant from native NIR is within 3 Da of the expected mass difference.Table IICharacterization of native and mutant AfNIRsParameterNativeD98NH255DH255NMass (Da)36,843 (36,838)2-aThe absolute mass of the native form is given along with the theoretical mass in parentheses.

Open table in a new tab Copper content was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy to ensure that the mutations did not affect occupation of copper. The copper content of the samples was found to be 1.8 ± 0.1 atoms of copper per AfNIR monomer except for the H255N mutant, which had a lower copper occupation of 1.5 atoms of copper per monomer (Table II). The variation in the copper content is likely due to small differences in copper occupation between preparations and errors involved in the determination of protein concentrations using the Bradford assay. UV-visible spectroscopy was used to probe changes in the electronic structure of the type I copper site. The visible absorbance maxima of native AfNIR and the three mutants are at the same three characteristic wavelengths of 458, 585, and 680 nm as seen in previous preparations of native AfNIR (3Kakutani T. Watanabe H. Arima K. Beppu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 89: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Murphy M.E.P. Turley S. Adman E.T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5246-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Also, the ratio of the 458- and 585-nm bands (1.3 ± 0.05) is well conserved among the three mutants and native AfNIR (Table II). Extinction coefficients for the mutants were calculated to be 3.0 × 103m−1 cm−1 for the trimer using absorbance at 458 nm and protein concentrations determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). A more rigorous analysis of both the type I and type II copper sites was performed with EPR spectroscopy, which showed a slight perturbation in the type II copper sites in the D98N and H255N mutants, but not in the H255D mutant (Fig. 1). Overall, the EPR parameters are similar to previously published values (7Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Murphy M.E.P. Turley S. Adman E.T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T.

These perturbations may be the result of small shifts in the positions of the ligand waters observed in the crystal structures.Table IIIEPR parameters of native and mutant NIRsNIRType IType IIg■A■ (G)g■A■(G)Native2.1972 ± 102.33135 ± 5D98N2.2170 ± 52.36100 ± 5H255N2.2182 ± 102.53160 ± 10H255D2.1970 ± 52.33140 ± 15 Open table in a new tab The specific activity measured for native AfNIR is within experimental error of that reported for native AfNIR from a previous periplasmic recombinant expression system (7Kukimoto M.

The specific activities of the mutants are much lower than the native enzyme (Table II). Of the three mutants, D98N AfNIR is the most active with a specific activity 94-fold less than that of the native AfNIR. The H255D and H255N mutants are a further 5- and 18-fold less active, respectively. All three mutants crystallized in space group R3 with one monomer in the asymmetric unit resulting in the functional trimer being generated by the crystallographic 3-fold. These crystals are isomorphous with those obtained previously for M150E AfNIR; however, previous crystals of the native protein are of space group P212121 and contain the complete trimer in the asymmetric unit (11Murphy M.E.P.

The residues modeled begin at Ala-4 and end at Gly-339 (D98N structure) or Glu-342 (H255N and H255D structures). Ramachandran plots of the mutant structures shows that over 90% of the residues are in the most favored conformation with the remaining residues occupying allowed conformations. In each of the mutants there is a short region of poor density that correlates to a surface-exposed disordered loop starting at residue 187 and ending at residue 192.

https://openalex.org/W2004340067,"Activated Ras has been shown to provide powerful antiapoptotic signals to cells through well defined transcriptional and post- translational pathways, whereas translational control as a mechanism of Ras survival signaling remains unexplored. Here we show a direct relationship between assembly of the cap-dependent translation initiation apparatus and suppression of apoptosis by oncogenic Ras in vitro and in vivo. Decreasing protein synthesis with rapamycin, which is known to inhibit cap-dependent translation, increases the susceptibility of Ras-transformed fibroblasts to cytostatic drug-induced apoptosis. In contrast, suppressing global protein synthesis with equipotent concentrations of cycloheximide actually prevents apoptosis. Enforced expression of the cap-dependent translational repressor, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein (4E-BPI), sensitizes fibroblasts to apoptosis in a manner strictly dependent on its ability to sequester eIF4E from a translationally active complex with eIF4GI and the co-expression of oncogenic Ras. Ectopic expression of 4E-BP1 also promotes apoptosis of Ras-transformed cells injected into immunodeficient mice and markedly diminishes their tumorigenicity. These results establish that eIF4E-dependent protein synthesis is essential for survival of fibroblasts bearing oncogenic Ras and support the concept that activation of cap-dependent translation by extracellular ligands or intrinsic survival signaling molecules suppresses apoptosis, whereas synthesis of proteins mediating apoptosis can occur independently of the cap."
https://openalex.org/W2074122713,"Uracil uptake by Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by the FUR4-encoded uracil permease. The modification of uracil permease by phosphorylation at the plasma membrane is a key mechanism for regulating endocytosis of this protein. This modification in turn facilitates its ubiquitination and internalization. Following endocytosis, the permease is targeted to the lysosome/vacuole for proteolysis. We have previously shown that uracil permease is phosphorylated at several serine residues within a well characterized N-terminal PEST sequence. In this report, we provide evidence that lysine residues 38 and 41, adjacent to the PEST sequence, are the target sites for ubiquitination of the permease. Conservative substitutions at both Lys38 and Lys41 give variant permeases that are phosphorylated but fail to internalize. The PEST sequence contains potential phosphorylation sites conforming to the consensus sequences for casein kinase 1. Casein kinase 1 (CK1) protein kinases, encoded by the redundant YCKI and YCK2 genes, are located at the plasma membrane. Either alone supports growth, but loss of function of both is lethal. Here, we show that in CK1-deficient cells, the permease is poorly phosphorylated and poorly ubiquitinated. Moreover, CK1 overproduction rescued the defective endocytosis of a mutant permease in which the serine phosphoacceptors were replaced by threonine (a less effective phosphoacceptor), which suggests that Yck activity may play a direct role in phosphorylating the permease. Permease internalization was not greatly affected in CK1-deficient cells, despite the low level of ubiquitination of the protein. This may be due to CK1 having a second counteracting role in endocytosis as shown by the higher turnover of variant permeases with unphosphorylatable versions of the PEST sequence.

The completion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequencing project made it possible to determine that there are 113 conventional protein kinase genes, corresponding to 2% of the total number of genes. Casein kinase 1 (CK1)1 protein kinases are ubiquitous and abundant Ser/Thr-specific protein kinases. The activity of this protein kinase family relies upon upstream acidic and/or phosphorylated amino acids for substrate recognition (1Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 123-164PubMed Google Scholar). The members of each subfamily differ in substrate selectivity and subcellular location. There are four CK1 proteins in S. cerevisiae, forming two essential gene pairs (2Hoekstra M.F. Liskay R.M. Ou A.C. DeMaggio A.J. Burbee D.G. Heffron F.

Cells with only one of these genes are able to grow, but the loss of function of both is lethal. The similar and functionally interchangeable kinases encoded by these two genes are peripheral plasma membrane proteins and are most probably anchored to the plasma membrane by a carboxyl-terminal isoprenyl modification (6Vancura A. Sessler A. Leichus B. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19271-19278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The location of the Yck2p isoform at the membrane is dynamic, with this protein showing cell cycle-specific localization to sites of polarized growth (7Robinson L.C. Bradley C. Bryan J.D. Jerome A. Kweon Y. Panek H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1077-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Wild-type levels of Yck activity are required for efficient constitutive endocytosis of the pheromone receptor Ste3p (8Panek H.R. Stepp J.D. Engle H.M. Marks K.M. Tan P.K. Lemmon S.K. Robinson L.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4194-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Casein kinase I activity has also been shown to be required for efficient phosphorylation, which allows ubiquitination and the subsequent internalization of the other yeast pheromone receptor, Ste2p, in response to α-factor binding (9Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It is still unknown whether casein kinase 1 directly phosphorylates these proteins. The degradation of a growing number of permeases has been reported to require endocytosis and subsequent transport of the permeases to the vacuole, the site of degradation (10Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Many permeases are internalized constitutively from the plasma membrane, and increasing the rate of internalization is a major mechanism in yeast cells for controlling the transport of nutrients in response to stress or nutritional changes (see Ref. 11Séron K. Blondel M.-O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Volland C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein).

The turnover of uracil permease is constitutive, and the rate of turnover is increased by stress conditions such as nutrient starvation, heat shock, excess of uracil, and the inhibition of protein synthesis (11Séron K. Blondel M.-O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Volland C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Géraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol.

A crucial step in plasma membrane protein targeting for internalization involves the initial recognition of endocytic cargo proteins by the ubiquitination machinery. Phosphorylation of uracil permease regulates its cell surface ubiquitination (18Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), a process that is required for subsequent internalization (21Galan J.M. Moreau V. André B. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). After internalization, the permease is targeted to the vacuole for proteolysis (20Volland C.

Permease ubiquitination is mediated by the essential Npi1p/Rsp5p ubiquitin-protein ligase, which is also required for the ubiquitination of other yeast transporters: Gap1p, the maltose permease, Tat2p, and Zrt1p (22Hein C.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), revealed a similar situation, with in each case a small number of target lysines accepting short chains of ubiquitin. We have shown that Fur4p internalization is dependent upon the permease being phosphorylated at several serine residues within a proline/glutamic acid/serine/threonine-rich stretch of amino acids known as the PEST sequence (18Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We report in this paper the critical role of lysines 38 and 41, N-terminal to the PEST sequence, in ubiquitin-mediated internalization of the permease. The ubiquitination of Fur4p and Ste2p is regulated by their prior phosphorylation (9Hicke L. Zanolari B. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 18Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The kinases that phosphorylate Fur4p have yet to be identified. In this study, we report that CK1 activity affects the phosphorylation status of the permease, which is important for its subsequent ubiquitination and internalization. The wild type strain 27061b (MAT a ura3 trp1) was derived from strain Σ1278b (31Béchet J. Grenson M. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 12: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar); the congenic wild-type strain LRB341 (MATahis3 leu2 ura3–52) and CK1-defective strains LRB343 (MATahis3 leu2 ura3–52 yck2–1::HIS3) and LRB346 (MATα his3 leu2 ura3–52 Δyck1 yck2–1ts) have been described elsewhere (32Robinson L.C. Menold M.M. Garrett S. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2870-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The chromosome-encoded uracil permease is produced in very small amounts, and cells that produce the permease from multicopy plasmids were used for accurate measurement of permease activity and for the immunodetection of the protein (16Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The multicopy plasmid, p195gF (2μ URA3 GAL-FUR4) (20Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Géraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), carries the FUR4 gene under the control of the GAL10 promoter. The multicopy plasmid, p1034 (2μ TRP1 p-,t-PGK), and its derivative, p1164, containing the YCK2 gene under the control of the PGK promoter, were kindly provided by Sanofi Recherche (Labège, France). Yeast strains were transformed as described by Gietz et al. (33Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2898) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 30 °C (or 24 °C for thermosensitive strains) in minimal medium (YNB) containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) and supplemented with appropriate nutrients. The carbon source was 2% glucose, or 4% galactose plus 0.05% glucose. One A 600 unit corresponds to approximately 2 × 107 cells/ml. Site-directed mutagenesis of FUR4was performed either using the Stratagene Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit as recommended by the supplier (K38R and K38R/K41R)) or by overlap extension using the polymerase chain reaction for the other mutations (34Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6849) Google Scholar). Mutated constructs were identified by testing for restriction site polymorphism introduced by the mutagenic primers and by sequencing. For each mutagenesis, two independent mutant plasmids were used to transform yeast, and two yeast transformants were analyzed for each mutant plasmid. Uracil uptake was measured in exponentially growing cells as described previously (16Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast culture (1 ml) was incubated with 5 μm [14C]uracil (ICN) for 20 s at 30 °C and then quickly filtered through Whatman GF/C filters, which were then washed twice with ice-cold water and counted for radioactivity. Cell extracts were prepared, and proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (20Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Géraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an antiserum directed against the last 10 residues of Fur4p (gift from R. Jund and M. R. Chevallier, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Strasbourg, France). Primary antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody detected by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Yeast cells (80A 600 units) in the exponential growth phase were harvested by centrifugation in the presence of 10 mm sodium azide and used to prepare plasma membrane-enriched fractions as described previously (21Galan J.M. Moreau V. André B. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (20Volland C. Urban-Grimal D. Géraud G. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using thermosensitive secretory mutants, it has been shown that uracil permease (Fur4p) is phosphorylated after its arrival at the cell surface (16Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The permease is phosphorylated mostly at a PEST-like sequence extending from position 42 to 59 at the hydrophilic N terminus of Fur4p (Fig. 1 A). This sequence has been shown to be essential for uracil permease turnover (18Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The permease-PEST sequence contains potential phosphorylation sites conforming to consensus sequences for various kinases including CK1 (Ser45 if the preceding serines, Ser42and/or Ser43, are phosphorylated and Ser55 and Ser56) (Fig. 1 A). Two other potential sites for casein kinase 1 phosphorylation are present in the hydrophilic extremities of the permease. One is located in the extreme N terminus of the protein (Ser25), and the other is in the extreme C-terminal domain (Ser622). Both termini of the permease extend into the cytoplasm (35Garnier C. Blondel M.O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Point mutation analysis has been used to investigate the role of several serines in both extremities of the permease, including those belonging to all the potential casein kinase 1 phosphorylation sites (18Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). By replacement of the corresponding serines with alanines, it was shown that only serines located in a PEST region extending from position 42 to 59 in the permease were phosphoacceptors for turnover of the protein. We used a mutant lacking the YCK1 gene and carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of the YCK2 gene,yck2–2 (hereafter referred to asyck ts), to investigate the role of Yck activity in controlling the phosphorylation status of the permease. First, we followed the cell surface delivery of uracil permease in wild-type and yck ts cells. Permease was produced under control of the inducible GAL10 promoter by adding galactose to the medium of cells grown on lactate at 24 °C and shifted for 30 min to 37 °C. Uracil uptake was monitored for 2 h. The level and kinetics of permease activity were similar in wild-type and mutant cells (data not shown). Thus, CK1 deficiency did not delay the delivery of uracil permease to the plasma membrane. We then compared the phosphorylation status of Fur4p produced in wild-type (YCK), and yck ts cells after incubation at restrictive temperature (Fig. 1 B). Phosphorylation of the permease produced in wild-type cells gave bands that migrated more slowly on immunoblots and which down-shifted upon alkaline phosphatase treatment (16Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We compared the electrophoretic mobilities of the wild type (YCK) and mutant (yck) cells. The loss of Yck1p and Yck2p activities altered the banding pattern of Fur4p, with the loss of slower migrating bands and the appearance of faster migrating bands. A significant change in phosphorylation pattern was also observed (but to a lesser extent) if either of the kinase isoforms were altered independently (i.e. if the Fur4p banding pattern was analyzed in either yck2Δ cells oryck ts cells incubated at 24 °C) (data not shown). Changing all five serine residues of the PEST region to alanines (5SA variant permease) resulted in a much lower level of phosphorylation of the permease in wild-type cells (Ref. 18Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar and Fig. 1B). The banding pattern of the 5SA variant was more affected than that of Fur4p produced in yck ts cells, and it was not affected further by production in yck tscells. These results show that Yck activity plays a direct or indirect role in phosphorylating the Fur4p-PEST sequence and that Yck1p and Yck2p contribute equally to the phosphorylation of the protein. Other kinases may also phosphorylate the permease because the level of phosphorylation of Fur4p in yck ts cells was intermediate between those observed in wild-type and 5SA permeases. Ubiquitination of the permease is a cell surface event required for internalization (21Galan J.M. Moreau V. André B. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of the permease is dependent upon the protein being phosphorylated in its PEST region (18Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We investigated whether a lack of Yck kinase activity reduced the level of permease ubiquitination. The ubiquitin-permease conjugates from membrane extracts of wild-type cells grown at 24 °C were detected as a ladder of four minor bands of lower mobility than the main permease band (Fig. 1 C). It has previously been demonstrated immunologically that these bands correspond to mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraubiquitin-permease conjugates (21Galan J.M. Moreau V. André B. Volland C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10946-10952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 27Galan J.-M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The amount of ubiquitinated wild-type permease was relatively small according to the distribution of immunoreactive material, but ubiquitin conjugates accumulated if the cells were subjected to stressful conditions such as a shift to high temperature. Membrane extracts were prepared from wild-type and yck ts cells grown at 24 °C and shifted to 37 °C for 30 min. Wild-type cells producing Fur4p had a higher proportion of ubiquitin-permease conjugates (relative to the main permease signal) than did wild-type cells incubated at 24 °C. No ubiquitin-permease conjugates were detected in wild-type cells producing 5SA or ΔPEST variant at 24 °C (data not shown; Ref. 18Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Upon shift to 37 °C, cells producing the 5SA (but not cells producing ΔPEST) had some ubiquitin-permease conjugates but in smaller amounts, indicating that the addition of ubiquitin to the permease is not entirely precluded by preventing the phosphorylation of the PEST sequence. yck ts cells incubated at restrictive temperature and producing either wild-type or 5SA variant permeases had very little ubiquitin-permease conjugate, with similar amounts present in each case (mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraubiquitin-permease conjugates were all detectable on an overexposed film). There were similar levels in ubiquitin-5SA conjugates in YCK and yck tscells, as expected for this unphosphorylatable Fur4p mutant. These data indicate that Fur4p was ubiquitinated in yck tscells, but less efficiently than in wild-type cells. This suggests that the phosphorylation of specific serine residues by Yck activity within the PEST region is required for the correct ubiquitination of the permease. To determine whether mutations in the YCK1and YCK2 genes affected Fur4p internalization, we studied permease activity after the inhibition of protein synthesis in wild-type and yck ts cells grown at 24 °C and shifted to 37 °C for 30 min (Fig.2 A). The addition of cycloheximide caused a sharp decrease in uracil uptake in wild-type cells incubated at 37 °C. The decrease in uracil uptake was less severe in yck ts cells shifted to the restrictive temperature. The relative protection (1.5 times) against loss of permease activity indicated that the defect in Yck activity stabilized the transporter at the plasma membrane. Extracts from cells withdrawn at various times after the addition of cycloheximide were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 B). Significant protection against degradation was observed in yck ts cells. Therefore, internalization and the subsequent degradation of the permease depend directly or indirectly on Yck kinase activity. The defective phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Fur4p in yck ts cells is reminiscent of the profile of modifications observed for a variant permease with three alanine for serine substitutions in the PEST sequence (18Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Internalization of this variant was strongly inhibited (relative protection, 2.7 times). Conversely, Fur4p internalization was slightly affected in yck ts cells (relative protection, 1.5 times) (Fig. 2 A) despite being severely underphosphorylated and underubiquitinated (Fig. 1, B and C). This suggests that Yck proteins may also be required for the regulation of some components of the endocytosis machinery. This possibility was investigated by examining the fate in yck tscells of variant permeases insensitive to phosphorylation within the PEST sequence (Fig. 2 C). We first investigated the fate of the 5SE variant, in which all of the serines in the PEST sequence are replaced by glutamic acids, mimicking the negatively charged phosphoserines (18Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although the pattern of ubiquitination (data not shown) and internalization (Fig. 2 C) of the 5SE variant was identical to that of Fur4p in wild-type cells shifted to 37 °C, this protein was internalized faster in yck ts cells shifted to the restrictive temperature (1.4 times faster). We then assessed the turnover of the 5SA variant permease. Due to the lack of phosphoacceptors in the PEST sequence, the 5SA variant is very poorly ubiquitinated (Fig. 1 C). Consequently, if protein synthesis was inhibited, almost no decrease in uracil uptake was detected throughout the experiment in wild-type cells. Upon the addition of cycloheximide to yck ts cells, a significant decrease in uracil uptake was observed, such that the half-life of the 5SA variant could be measured within the duration of the experiment. With the first step of phosphorylation bypassed (5SE) or irrelevant (5SA), the accelerated decay of permease activity became evident. This indicates that Yck activity may negatively regulate a trans-acting component involved in the internalization process and suggests that the limited stabilization of Fur4p at the plasma membrane observed in yck ts cells may be due to the counteracting effect of this possible second mode of regulation by YCK. We investigated whether some of the serine residues within the PEST sequence are the true phosphoacceptors for casein kinase 1, using a 5ST variant in which all the serines in the PEST sequence had been replaced by threonines (5ST variant). Serine kinases can also use threonine, but somewhat less efficiently, and we have previously observed that the 5ST variant protein is indeed poorly phosphorylated (18Marchal C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Urban-Grimal D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). First, we compared the phosphorylation status of Fur4p and 5ST variant proteins in wild-type cells with and without overexpression of the YCK2 gene encoding one of the two homologous casein kinase 1 proteins (Fig.3 A).

Basal [Ca2+]cyt was about 50 nm; thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) or other agonists increased [Ca2+]cyt to 1 μm or higher. Basal [Ca2+]er averaged 500 μmand fell to 50–100 μm over 10 min in the presence of thapsigargin. TRH consistently decreased [Ca2+]er to 100 μm, independent of extracellular Ca2+, whereas agonists for endogenous receptors generally caused a smaller decline. When added with thapsigargin, all agonists rapidly decreased [Ca2+]er to 5–10 μm, indicating that there is substantial store refilling during signaling. TRH increased [Ca2+]cyt and decreased [Ca2+]er if applied after other agonists, whereas other agonists did not alter [Ca2+]cyt or [Ca2+]er if added after TRH. When Ca2+ was added back to cells that had been incubated with TRH in Ca2+-free medium, [Ca2+]cyt and [Ca2+]er increased rapidly.

The Ca2+ store is refilled by the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), a Ca2+ pump.

Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). TotalCa2+ in the ER is usually estimated indirectly by adding a Ca2+ ionophore to cells loaded with a cytoplasmic Ca2+ reporter under conditions where ER Ca2+ is preferentially released. The resultant increase in Ca2+ in the cytoplasm provides an estimate of the amount of Ca2+released from the ER.Using Fura-2, we previously characterized the Ca2+responses of a HEK 293 cell line expressing receptors for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and found that the refilling of the total intracellular Ca2+ store, measured indirectly, appeared to be the limiting step in TRH regulation of [Ca2+]cyt (21Yu R. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28301-28307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Yu R. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Endocr. 1998; 12: 737-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used the cameleons to measure directly the free Ca2+concentration in the ER and have followed the depletion and refilling of the intracellular Ca2+ store in response to agonists, SERCA pump inhibitors, and ionomycin. We show that free Ca2+ in the ER is around 500 μm and that during signaling, ER Ca2+ is continually replenished by the SERCA pump with cytoplasmic Ca2+ that has entered the cell from the extracellular space.DISCUSSIONWe have used the novel cameleon Ca2+ indicators (14Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar) to obtain new information about the concentration of free Ca2+ in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum during hormonal signaling in a well characterized model system (21Yu R. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28301-28307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Shupnik M.A. Weck J. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Endocr. 1996; 10: 90-99PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic cameleon YC2 offers several advantages. WithKd values of 4.3 μm and 100 nm, it is able to detect changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ in both the micromolar and low nanomolar ranges, where conventional Ca2+ indicators are of limited usefulness. The dual affinity cameleons report changes in free Ca2+ over a broad range, but the absolute changes in fluorescence ratio are small and their sensitivity is fairly low, and calibration is problematic. YC2, YC3er, and YC4er are also sensitive to pH (14Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar, 20Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). This should not have been a problem with TRH, which has almost no effect on cytoplasmic pH unless cells are artificially acidified (27Hallam T.J. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but was a concern with ionomycin, which is a Ca2+/proton ionophore. Several lines of evidence, however, suggest that the changes in fluorescence ratio reported here were primarily due to changes in Ca2+. First, moderate changes in pH affect the 535 nm but not the 485 nm fluorescence emission of the cameleons; in our experiments, fluorescence changed in the expected directions at both wavelengths. Second, Ca2+ changes were in opposite directions for the cytoplasmic YC2 and the ER-targeted dyes. There is reportedly no pH gradient between the cytoplasm and the ER (28Kim J.H. Johannes L. Goud B. Antony C. Lingwood C.A. Daneman R. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Third, ionomycin did not affect the fluorescence of YC3er or YC4er when added to cells with already depleted intracellular pools. For these reasons, pH effects must have been minor contributors to the overall changes in fluorescence ratio. A newer version of the cytoplasmic reporter has greatly reduced pH sensitivity (20Miyawaki A. Griesbeck O. Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2135-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar).Dynamics of [Ca2+]erAlthough we found a range of [Ca2+]er values in different cells, most were between 200 and 700 μm, averaging 500 μm, in good agreement with values obtained by Miyawakiet al. (14Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar) for [Ca2+]er in HeLa cells. Previous studies using various means of measurements have led to estimates of basal [Ca2+]er between 100 μm and several millimolar (15Bygrave F.L. Benedetti A. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).It is necessary to postulate that much of the Ca2+ released by both the agonist mixture and TRH was re-sequestered to account for the dramatically greater decline in [Ca2+]erseen when SERCA inhibitors were added with hormones. In fact, refilling is expected to accelerate as [Ca2+]er drops, because the activity of the SERCA pump is inhibited by high Ca2+ in the ER lumen (9Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7238-7242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mogami H. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and the rate of Ca2+ transport increases as [Ca2+]cyt rises (30Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Verboomen H. Wuytack F. De Smedt H. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). An apparent equilibrium is reached when [Ca2+]er is around 100 μm, at which point the rates of Ca2+ release through the IP3 receptor and Ca2+ refilling by the SERCA pump become similar. It may be that [Ca2+]er is not normally permitted to fall much below 100 μm, even when agonists are present, to preserve other functions of the ER. Our results differ from the situation in HeLa cells, where SERCA inhibitors do not potentiate the agonist-promoted decline in [Ca2+]er (32Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the HEK293 cells studied here, the balance between Ca2+reuptake and Ca2+ efflux appears to preserve Ca2+ in the ER better when cells are treated with a mixture of agonists for endogenous receptors than when cells are treated with TRH. It is not clear if this difference is the result of intrinsic differences in signaling through different receptors, or the high level of expression of the transfected TRH receptor. Overall, the results point to a very rapid turnover of Ca2+ following activation of Ca2+ mobilizing, G protein-coupled receptors. In contrast, the rate of turnover of ER Ca2+ appeared to be low in resting cells, since [Ca2+]er was quite stable following simple removal of extracellular Ca2+.Our conclusions regarding the rapid turnover of Ca2+ in HEK293 cells are in agreement with those of Hofer et al.(33Hofer A.M. Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) who used magfura to monitor [Ca2+]er in BHK cells and found that uptake of Ca2+ into the ER takes place during agonist stimulation, even under conditions where cytoplasmic Ca2+ is low. Our results, however, differ from those reached by Barrero et al. (32Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) studying HeLa cells, where agonists seem to release the minimal amount of ER Ca2+ sufficient to produce a cytoplasmic Ca2+increase. In HeLa cells, the release of ER Ca2+ in response to agonists is halted by the inhibitory effects of high cytoplasmic Ca2+ and low luminal Ca2+ on the IP3 receptor. In HEK293 cells, agonists still cause a strong decline in [Ca2+]er in the face of high cytoplasmic and low luminal Ca2+ and refilling continues during signaling. Differences in IP3 generation and metabolism, IP3 receptor subtypes and abundance, and SERCA activity could all contribute to these observed differences between cell types.Ca2+ Store RefillingOur data show that extracellular Ca2+ is not critical for the maintenance of the ER Ca2+ store over at least 10 min if no agonists or SERCA inhibitors are present. In the presence of IP3, however, the intracellular Ca2+ store is continuously refilled. If stores were allowed to become depleted, then increasing cytoplasmic Ca2+ resulted in increased ER Ca2+; this was evident, for example, in the Ca2+ re-addition paradigm. This increase was expected, since Kmvalues for the SERCA pumps are high enough, 0.2–0.4 μm(30Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Verboomen H. Wuytack F. De Smedt H. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), that an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ would be expected to lead to an increase in the amount of Ca2+pumped. We found that refilling was completely eliminated with BAPTA-AM, indicating that the Ca2+ for pool refilling entered from the cytoplasm. These results are consistent with recent data showing that even though ER-plasma membrane communication and the IP3 receptor are critical for store operated Ca2+ influx, stores are replenished with Ca2+from the cytoplasm (33Hofer A.M. Landolfi B. Debellis L. Pozzan T. Curci S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Bian J.H. Ghosh T.K. Wang J.C. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8801-8806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our results suggest that the intracellular Ca2+ store is refilled with Ca2+ from the cytosol by the SERCA pump and perhaps by an additional, thapsigargin-insensitive mechanism. [Ca2+]er increased significantly when extracellular Ca2+ was reintroduced to cells that had been treated with thapsigargin or cyclopiazonic acid in Ca2+-free medium, although the increase in [Ca2+]er was always much greater when SERCA pumps were active. A thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+ pump has been postulated previously (35Hussain A. Garnett C. Klein M.G. Tsai-Wu J.J. Schneider M.F. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12140-12146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Nori A. Fulceri R. Gamberucci A. Benedetti A. Volpe P. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Alternatively, residual SERCA activity in thapsigargin- and cyclopiazonic acid-treated cells may have been enough to increase [Ca2+]er in the range detected by the high affinity YC3er, or in this paradigm Ca2+ may have been moving down a gradient into the ER.By using the cameleons to monitor changes in free Ca2+ in the ER and cytoplasm directly, we have shown that there is a very high rate of turnover of ER Ca2+ during hormonally stimulated Ca2+ signaling. During signaling, the intracellular Ca2+ store is continuously refilled by the SERCA pump using Ca2+ from the cytoplasm. Future studies will be directed toward identifying the subcellular localization of the sites in the ER involved in this rapid release and reuptake of Ca2+. The cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt)1is a dynamic signal regulating a variety of important cellular functions such as secretion, contraction, metabolism, and gene transcription (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). Ca2+-mobilizing hormones release inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) which acts on the IP3 receptor to release Ca2+ from intracellular sites in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is not certain whether the entire ER or specialized compartments within the ER form the IP3-releasable Ca2+ store (2Bode H.P. Netter K.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 3Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem.

Ohnishi H. Wojcikiewicz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). IP3 receptors are Ca2+ channels that open as the IP3 concentration increases sufficiently. The cytoplasmic and possibly ER Ca2+ concentrations also regulate the sensitivity of the IP3 receptor to IP3 (7Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E.

The Ca2+ store is refilled by the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), a Ca2+ pump. Like Ca2+ in the cytosol, Ca2+ in intracellular stores is largely bound to Ca2+-binding proteins; only free Ca2+ is believed to participate directly in Ca2+ signaling (7Hagar R.E. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1998; 396: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 10Taylor C.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, W122F and W122A completely lost their catalase activity but retained their peroxidase activity. Bimolecular rate constants of compound I formation of the wild-type enzyme and the mutants have been determined. The Trp-122 mutants for the first time made it possible to follow the transition of the ferric enzyme to compound I by hydrogen peroxide spectroscopically underlining the important role of Trp-122 in catalase activity. The results demonstrate that the role of the distal His-Arg pair in catalase-peroxidases is important in the heterolytic cleavage of hydrogen peroxide (i.e. compound I formation), whereas the distal tryptophan is essential for compound I reduction by hydrogen peroxide. Catalase-peroxidases have a predominant catalase activity but differ from monofunctional catalases in exhibiting a substantial peroxidase activity and in having different residues in the heme cavity. We present a kinetic study of the formation of the key intermediate compound I by probing the role of the conserved distal amino acid triad Arg-Trp-His of a recombinant catalase-peroxidase in its reaction with hydrogen peroxide, peroxoacetic acid, and m-chloroperbenzoic acid.

They are components of the oxidative defense system of bacterial (1Loewen P.C. Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 273-308Google Scholar) and fungal (2Fraaije M.W. Roubroeks H.P. Hagen W.R. Van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J.

They are different from classical monofunctional catalases. On the basis of sequence similarities with fungal cytochromec peroxidase (CCP) and plant ascorbate peroxidases (APX), KatGs have been shown to be members of class I of the superfamily of plant, fungal, and bacterial peroxidases (4Welinder K.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 388-393Crossref Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Despite striking sequence homologies between class I enzymes, there are dramatic differences in the catalytic activity and substrate specificity (5Obinger C. Regelsberger G. Strasser G. Burner U. Peschek G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Regelsberger G. Obinger C. Zoder R. Altmann F. Peschek G.A. FEMS Microbiol.

The most interesting feature of bifunctional catalase-peroxidases is the overwhelming catalase activity with overall rate constants comparable with those of monofunctional catalases. In both CCP and APX, the catalase activity can be neglected. KatGs also function as broad specificity peroxidases, oxidizing various electron donors, including NAD(P)H (8Marcinkeviciene J.A.

Chem. 1984; 259: 13027-13036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Patterson W.R. Poulos T.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4331-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and exhibit highly conserved amino acid residues at the active site. They indicate the presence of a proximal histidine as well as the triad Arg-Trp-His at the distal side. Both physical characterization as well as sequence analysis suggest the presence of these residues also in catalase-peroxidases (6Regelsberger G. Obinger C. Zoder R. Altmann F. Peschek G.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 170: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1987Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At the moment there is no structural basis to understand the catalytic features of catalase-peroxidases. Thus, in developing ideas how protein structure modifies heme reactivity, class I peroxidases are an extremely exciting field of research, with KatGs being the least understood type of peroxidase. The initial step in the catalytic mechanism of a peroxidase or catalase is heterolysis of the oxygen-oxygen bond of hydrogen peroxide. This reaction causes the release of one water molecule (15Schonbaum G.R. Lo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3353-3360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and coordination of the second oxygen atom to the iron center (16Hager L.P. Doubek D.L. Silverstein R.M. Harges J.H. Martin J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 4364-4366Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Two electrons are transferred from the enzyme to the coordinated oxygen atom, one from the iron and one from a second donor. In pea cytosolic APX, the porphyrin serves as the second donor (17Patterson W.R. Poulos T.L. Goodin D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4342-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), whereas, in CCP, the second donor is Trp-191 (18Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Mauro J.M. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7992-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 19Scholes C.P. Liu Y. Fishel L.A. Farnum M.A. Mauro J.M. Kraut J. Isr. J.

Recently, we have shown that the spectrum of KatG compound I is reminiscent to APX compound I (7Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Engleder M. Rüker F. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10480-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with the important difference (and this is caused by the overwhelming catalase activity) that compound I formation of KatG could never be monitored with hydrogen peroxide. Instead of H2O2, it was necessary to use peroxoacetic acid (7Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Engleder M. Rüker F. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10480-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The triad Arg-Trp-His is located near the peroxide binding site. Histidine is suggested to function as a general acid/base catalyst that assists in deprotonating the hydroperoxide and protonating the departing water (18Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Mauro J.M. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7992-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), whereas distal arginine is proposed to stabilize the transition state for compound I formation by interacting with the developing negative charge on the oxygen atom being reduced during the heterolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond and to stabilize the resulting oxy-ferryl center of compound I (21Vitello L.B. Erman J.E. Miller M.A. Wang J. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9807-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The role of distal tryptophan is least clear. In CCP the mutant W51F has been shown to be hyperactive (22Roe J.A. Goodin D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20037-20045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work we undertook a detailed analysis of compound I formation of recombinant catalase-peroxidase from the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis PCC 6803. Our goal was to elucidate the role of the distal triad Arg-Trp-His in peroxide binding and cleavage of KatG and to ascertain similarities or differences to both APX and CCP. The wild-type enzyme and six mutants (R119A, R119N, W122F, W122A, H123Q, H123E) have been investigated by both steady-state and presteady-state kinetic analysis. The most exciting finding of this work is the role of tryptophan in catalase activity of KatG. The Trp-122 mutants lost their catalase activity completely but retained their peroxidase activity. The consequence was that, for the first time, in these two proteins compound I formation could be followed spectroscopically also with hydrogen peroxide. Mutation of distal arginine and histidine gave 10- to 102-fold and 104-fold decreases in catalase activity, indicating a role in O-O heterolysis of hydrogen peroxide. In contrast, their role in compound I formation with peroxy acids was much less pronounced. Materials were from the following sources: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, hemin, pepstatin A, leupeptin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin from Sigma; GFX PCR DNA and gel band purification kit, chelating Sepharose Fast Flow, and HiPrep® Sephacryl S-300 HR 16/60 gels from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; the Centriprep-30 concentrators from Amicon; KpnI from Stratagene;BamHI and PstI restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and alkaline phosphatase from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; and Pfu polymerases from Promega and Stratagene, respectively. All other chemicals were of the highest purity grade available. Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was performed using PCR-mediated introduction of silent mutations as described (23Kohli R.M. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A pET-3a expression vector that contained the cloned catalase-peroxidase gene from the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis PCC 6803 (7Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Engleder M. Rüker F. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10480-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1987Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was used as the template for PCR. At first unique restriction sites were selected flanking the region to be mutated. The flanking primers were 5′-AAT GAT CAG GTA CCG GCC AGT AAA TG-3′ containing a KpnI restriction site and 5′-TGC ATA AAG GAT CCG GGT GC-3′ containing a BamHI restriction site. The internal 5′-primer was 5′-GCA CGC TGC AGG CAC TTA TCG CAT TG-3′ and possessed a PstI restriction site. The following mutant primers with the desired mutation and a silent mutation introducing a restriction site were constructed (point mutations italicized and restriction sites underlined): 5′-AGT GCC TGCAGC GTG CCA GGC CAT AGC AAT CAT TAA TC-3′ changed Arg-119 to Ala, 5′-AGT GCC TGCAGC GTG CCA GGC CAT GTT GAT CAG CCC ACC ATA ATG ACC-3′ changed Arg-119 to Asn, 5′-AGT GCC TGCAGC GTG GAA GGC CAT AC-3′ changed Trp-122 to Phe, 5′-AGT GCC TGCAGC GTG CGC GGC CAT AC-3′ changed Trp-122 to Ala, 5′-AGT GCC TGCAGC CTCCCA GGC CAT AC-3′ changed His-123 to Glu, and 5′-AGT GCC TGCAGC CTG CCA GGC CAT AC-3′ changed His-123 to Gln. The fragment defined by the KpnI and BamHI restriction sites was replaced by the new construct containing the point mutation. All constructs were sequenced to verify DNA changes using thermal cycle sequencing. The mutant recombinant catalase-peroxidases were expressed in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3)pLysS and purified as described previously by Regelsbergeret al. (7Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Engleder M. Rüker F. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10480-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and Jakopitsch et al. (14Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1987Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using the same conditions as for the wild-type enzyme. Catalase activity was determined in 50 mm citrate/phosphate or phosphate buffer adjusted to the corresponding pH in the range 3–9, both polarographically using a Clark-type electrode (YSI 5331 Oxygen Probe) inserted into a stirred water bath (YSI 5301B) at 25 °C and spectrophotometrically (24Beers R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 195: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an extinction coefficient for hydrogen peroxide at 240 nm of 39.4m−1 cm−1(25Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). One unit of catalase is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of H2O2/min at pH 7 and 25 °C. Peroxidase activity was monitored spectrophotometrically using 1 mmH2O2 and either 1 mm o-dianisidine (ε460 = 11.3 mm−1cm−1) or 20 mm pyrogallol (ε430 = 2.47 mm−1cm−1) following the oxidation rate in 67 mm phosphate buffer, pH. 7.0. One unit of peroxidase is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of electron donor/min at pH 7 and 25 °C. CD spectra were recorded on a Jobin Yvon CD6 dichrograph equipped with a thermostated cell holder, and data were recorded on-line using a personal computer. Spectra are averages of four accumulated scans with subtraction of the base line. The quartz cuvette used had a path length of 1 mm. All samples were measured at 20 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Protein concentrations were 1 μm in all experiments. Transient-state measurements were performed using an Applied Photophysics instrument (Model SX-18MV) equipped with a 1-cm observation cell thermostated at 15 °C. Rate constants from experimental traces were calculated by the SpectraKinetic workstation version 4.38 interfaced to the apparatus. Conventional stopped-flow analysis was used to investigate the oxidation of ferric enzyme by peroxides and formation of compound I. At least three determinations of the pseudo-first-order rate constants,k obs, were measured for each substrate concentration, and the mean value was used to calculate the second-order rate constants. To allow calculation of pseudo-first-order rates, the concentrations of substrates were at least 5 times that of the enzyme. The slope of the linear plot of the pseudo-first-order rate constant versus substrate concentration was used to obtain the second-order rate constant for the reaction. All stopped-flow experiments were performed in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with the exception of pH dependence studies on reaction rates for which the experimental traces were recorded in 50 mmcitrate/phosphate buffers at different pH values between 4.0 and 8.0. Reactions were also studied with a diode-array detector (model PD.1 from Applied Photophysics) as part of the stopped-flow machine, as well as in conventional steady-state spectroscopy using a Zeiss Specord S-10 diode-array spectrophotometer. Recently, we reported a high level expression in E. coli of a recombinant form of a homodimeric catalase-peroxidase from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. Both physical and preliminary kinetic characterization revealed its identity with the wild-type protein (7Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Engleder M. Rüker F. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10480-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 14Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1987Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig. 1depicts CD spectra of ferric native recombinant KatG and of all six mutants investigated in this study. The far-UV CD spectra give a measure of the protein secondary structure. The signal observed for catalase-peroxidase was characteristic of a protein composed primarily of α helices. Very little difference was observed between the CD spectra of wild-type and the six mutant proteins, indicating that there was no large scale conformational change in the structure. If conformational changes did occur, they must have been very localized and minimal and thus went undetected by CD. Since the α-helical content seemed to be insensitive to the amino acid substitution at the distal Arg, Trp, or His, we assumed that the mutants were folded properly, as is the wild-type enzyme. The absorption spectrum of the recombinant enzyme in the resting state exhibited the typical bands of a heme b-containing ferric peroxidase in the visible and near ultraviolet region. Fig.2 A shows the Soret peak to be at 406 nm and the two charge-transfer bands at 500 (CT2) and 631 nm (CT1). Both the Soret and the CT1 band suggested the presence of a five-coordinate high spin heme coexisting with a six-coordinate high spin heme. The A 406/A 280ratio (i.e. Reinheitszahl) varied between 0.63 and 0.65 and was similar to that of wild-type KatG (6Regelsberger G. Obinger C. Zoder R. Altmann F. Peschek G.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 170: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The spectral parameters of the mutants are summarized in Table I. Mutations of Arg, Trp, and His caused shifts of 1–4 nm at the Soret region and more pronounced shifts at both CT1 and CT2. Mutation of distal histidine led to a marked red-shift observed for the CT1 band, which (together with an increase of the shoulder at 380 nm) indicated an increase of the five-coordinate high spin heme at the expense of six-coordinate high spin heme. A similar but less pronounced transition was observed for R119A and R119N.Table IAbsorption maxima (ASoret, Aβ, Aα), Reinheitszahl (ASoret/A280 nm), apparent Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values (with H2O2) for wild-type (WT) and mutants (R119A, R119N, W122F, W122A, H123Q, H123E) of recombinant catalase-peroxidase from Synechocystis PCC 6803WTR119AR119NW122FW122AH123QH123EA Soret(nm)406410408409409404409Aβ(nm)500527505511521508515Aα(nm)631639637634628645640RZ (ASoret/A280 nm)0.640.680.630.600.640.460.48Km(mm)4.97.160NDND15.56.2k cat(s−1)350051317.3NDND0.831.17k cat/Km (s−1m−1)7.1 × 1057.2 × 1042.9 × 102NDND5.4 × 1011.9 × 102ND, not detectable; RZ, Reinheitzahl. Open table in a new tab ND, not detectable; RZ, Reinheitzahl. With the exception of His-123 mutants, both the protein yield (40–60 mg of recombinant KatG from 1 liter of E. coli culture) and the Reinheitszahl of the mutants were comparable with those of the wild-type enzyme. The lower heme content of H123Q and H123E could reflect that heme binding in these variants was disrupted. Recombinant KatG exhibited an overwhelming catalase activity. The polarographically measured specific catalase activity in the presence of 1 mm hydrogen peroxide was 553–624 units/mg of protein. The presence of classical peroxidase substrates influenced the oxygen release from hydrogen peroxide only to a small extent. With 1 mmH2O2 and either 5 mm o-dianisidine or 20 mm pyrogallol, the peroxidase activity was determined to be 2.0–2.8 units/mg and 5.4–6.1 units/mg, respectively. Although it is incorrect to treat catalase kinetics in a Michaelis-Menten way (and therefore the definition of Km and k cat should be avoided), we have calculated apparent Km and k cat values as has been done in the literature in recent years (5Obinger C. Regelsberger G. Strasser G. Burner U. Peschek G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Regelsberger G. Obinger C. Zoder R. Altmann F.

Chem. 1999; 380: 1987Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). With wild-type KatG (1 nm heme), there was a linear correlation in a Lineweaver-Burk plot between 50 μm and 10 mmhydrogen peroxide allowing determination of both apparentKm and v max. At H2O2 concentrations higher than 10 mm, a progressive inhibition of enzyme activity was seen. For the wild-type protein, the corresponding apparentk cat value with H2O2 as the sole substrate was determined to be 3500 s−1 and the apparent Km was 4.9 mm. The k cat/Km ratio was 7.1 × 105m−1s−1. Table I contains some of the kinetic constants for KatG and the investigated mutants. It shows how the mutations decrease the affinity for hydrogen peroxide as well as the turnover rates and thus confirms that the changed residues are involved in catalase activity of KatG. Interestingly, both Trp-122 mutants lost their catalase activity completely. Mutation of Arg-119 and His-123 gave partially active forms. Mutation of histidine decreased the k catvalue by a factor of 3000–4000, whereas the k cat value of catalase activity was 14.6% for R119A and 0.5% for R119N compared with the wild-type protein. The catalase activity of the variants was measured polarographically and was proportional to hydrogen peroxide concentrations in the range 2–20 mm. Corresponding to the effect of mutation on catalytic activity, the concentration of the mutants in the assays had to be 30–300 nm (per heme). At higher peroxide levels (>20 mm), the reaction rate again lost proportionality to H2O2 concentration. Generally, inactivation of mutants at high H2O2 concentration was more dramatic than inactivation of the wild-type protein. Both the wild-type protein and the Arg-119 and His-123 variants exhibited only a small decrease in absorbance (hypochromicity) of ∼0–2% at the Soret region. Assuming that compound I would give a Soret absorbance ∼60% that of the ferric enzyme (7Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Engleder M. Rüker F. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10480-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), these hypochromicities fitted a steady-state compound I concentration between 0% and 4%. This calculation was based on a hypothetical catalase reaction mechanism involving Reactions 1 (a and b) and 2 (a and b) in Fig. 6. During catalase activity the ratio of free enzyme to compound I is a constant determined by the rate constants of compound I formation,k 1(app), and compound I reduction,k 2(app). From [KatG]/[compound I] =k 2(app)/k 1(app) follows that during catalase activity k 2(app) ≫k 1(app). Our experiments demonstrated that mutation of distal Arg and His did not alter this ratio. On the contrary, mutation of distal Trp dramatically shifted this ratio. Addition of hydrogen peroxide to both catalatically inactive mutants W122F and W122A led to compound I accumulation. Apparently, in the Trp-122 variants, Reaction 2 (a and b) was blocked. The peroxidatic activity of the Arg-119 and His-123 mutants was reduced proportionally to the catalase activity. In contrast, in both Trp-122 variants, the peroxidatic to catalatic ratio dramatically increased. Although having lost the catalase activity, the specific peroxidase activity of W122F was still 0.5 units/mg (1 mmH2O2, 5 mm o-dianisidine) and 0.83 units/mg (1 mmH2O2, 20 mm pyrogallol). The initial event in the catalytic mechanism of a peroxidase or catalase is a two-electron oxidation of the enzyme by hydrogen peroxide to an intermediate called compound I (Reaction 1, a and b). Compound I of peroxidases normally exhibits the same Soret band maximum as the corresponding native peroxidase but a hypochromicity of about 40–50%. We have recently demonstrated that bifunctional catalase-peroxidases exhibit similar spectral changes upon addition of peroxides (7Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Engleder M. Rüker F. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10480-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast to its homologous members of class I peroxidases, APX and CCP, monitoring of compound I in KatGs is impossible because of its high catalase activity (k 2(app) ≫ k 1(app)). Consequently, peroxy acids had to be used to form a stable KatG compound I. From the single-mixing stopped-flow experiments on rates of compound I formation using excess peroxy acids, the following results were obtained. Reaction of wild-type KatG with both peroxoacetic acid (PA) and m-chloroperbenzoic acid (CPB) exhibited single exponential curves, indicating pseudo-first-order kinetics (Fig.2 B, inset). Plots of the first-order rate constants, k obs, versus peroxide concentration were linear with very small intercepts (<0.5 s−1) (Fig. 2 B). These small intercepts fitted well with the observation that wild-type compound I was stable for more than 30 s, even in the presence of excess PA. With PA and CPB the rate constants for compound I formation,k 1(app), were (3.9 ± 0.4) × 104m−1s−1 and (5.3 ± 0.2) × 104m−1s−1, respectively (pH 7.0, 15 °C). Fig.2 A shows the spectrum of KatG compound I produced by mixing 20 μm recombinant enzyme with 200 μmperoxoacetic acid. Its spectrum was distinguished from the resting state by a 40% hypochromicity at 406 nm and two distinct peaks at 604 and 643 nm. Isosbestic points between compound I and the resting enzyme were determined to be at 357, 430, and 516 nm. When PA or CPB was added to R119A and R119N, a similar exponential decrease of absorbance at the Soret maximum was observed. However, the exponential phase (representing ∼90% of total hypochromicity) was followed by a relatively slow decrease in absorbance of this mutant, and this decrease could be attributed to a decay of compound I. The pseudo-first-order rate constants, k obs, were calculated from the first exponential phase. The k 1(app) values determined from plots of these first-order rate constants, k obs,versus peroxide concentration are summarized in TableII. There was a distinct influence of mutations of Arg-119 on the reaction with PA, whereas the reactivity toward CPB seemed to be unaffected. With PA the intercepts were relatively small (0.2 s−1 with R119A and 1.1 s−1 with R119N), whereas with CPB the corresponding values were 3.6 and 4.5 s−1, respectively. This fitted well with the observation that CPB always caused a faster decrease in absorbance during the second (linear) phase than PA.Table IIApparent bimolecular rate constants, kapp, of the reaction of ferric catalase-peroxidase with various hydroperoxideskappWTR119AR119NW122FW122AH123QH123Em−1 s−1Hydrogen peroxideNDNDND8.2 × 1048.8 × 104NDNDPeroxoacetic acid3.9 × 1041.9 × 1034.5 × 1021.8 × 1052.1 × 105ND1.1 × 105m-Chloroperbenzoic acid5.3 × 1045.0 × 1041.4 × 1047.3 × 1049.0 × 1067.3 × 1047.5 × 106Wild-type (WT) and six mutants (R119A, R119N, W122F, W122A, H123Q, H123E) of recombinant enzyme from Synechocystis PCC 6803 were measured at 15 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0.

Mutation of His-123 and Trp-122 resulted also in a biphasic reactivity toward both PA and CPB and calculation of k 1(app) was performed by fitting the first exponential phase of reaction.

However, the factors controlling sPLA2-IIA production in human vascular cells are unknown. We investigated regulation of sPLA2-IIA expression and secretion by human arterial smooth muscle cells in culture (HASMC). SPLA2-IIA was induced after 3–14 days of culture in non-proliferating conditions. SPLA2-IIA was co-expressed with heavy caldesmon, a cytoskeleton protein, and p27, a G1 cyclin inhibitor, proteins characteristically expressed by differentiated cells. Further incubation with 50–500 units/ml of interferon (IFN)-γ significantly increased sPLA2-IIA mRNA and secretion. IFN-γ-induced sPLA2-IIA was found to be active in cell media and associated with cell membrane proteoglycans. IFN-γ induced sPLA2-IIA expression was antagonized by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-10. TNF-α added individually induced a significant but transient (4 h) increase in sPLA2-IIA secretion. IL-10 by itself did not affect sPLA2-IIA expression and secretion. IFN-γ-stimulated sPLA2-IIA transcription involved STAT-3 protein. Interestingly, IL-6 but not IFN-γ up-regulated the sPLA2-IIA expression in HepG2 cells, thus sPLA2-IIA induction by IFN-γ response appears to be cell specific. In summary, conditions leading to cell differentiation induced sPLA2-IIA expression in HASMC and further exposure to IFN-γ can up-regulate sPLA2-IIA transcription and secretion. This IFN-γ stimulatory effect can be modulated by other cytokines.

These products may either act as intracellular second messengers or can be further metabolized into proinflammatory and mitogenic lipid mediators including eicosanoids, platelet activating factor, and lysophosphatidic acid (1Dennis E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Lysophosphatidylcholine is a mediator of a broad range of cellular processes on vascular and inflammatory cells (2Durante W. Liao L. Peyon K.J. Schafer A.I. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 6931-6936Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). SPLA2-IIA appears to be involved in several physiological and pathological processes. It contributes to membrane remodeling and removal of oxidized phospholipids (7Eckey R. Menschikowski M. Lattke P. Jaross W. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 132: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, sPLA2-IIA has bactericidal and anti-tumorigenic properties, participates in TNFα-induced activation of nuclear transcription factor and expression of cell-adhesion molecules (8Weinrauch Y. Abad C. Liang N.-S. Lowry S.F. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 9Cormier R.T. Hong K.H. Halberg R.B. Hawkins T.L. Richardson P. Mulherkar R.

Pruzanski W. Kim J. Fornasier V. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 134: 807-811PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is a correlation between elevated levels of sPLA2-IIA and inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and coronary artery disease (12Nevalainen T.J.

Atherosclerosis has characteristics of an inflammatory process (14Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a high incidence of atherosclerosis and high mortality from cardiovascular diseases have been reported in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases that have prolonged periods of high extracellular sPLA2-IIA activity (15Wållberg-Jonsson M. Öhman M.-L. Dahlqvist S.R. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 445-451PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, transgenic mice overexpressing human sPLA2-IIA with high levels of the enzyme in plasma and in the aortic intima/media develop more aortic atherosclerosis than non-transgenic littermates (16Ivandic B. Castellini L.W. Wang X.-P. Qiao J.-H. Mehrabian M. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Grass D.S. Swanson M.E. de Beer M.C. de Beer F. Lusis A.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1284-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In humans it was recently reported that in patients with coronary artery disease the plasma level of sPLA2-IIA was an independent risk factor. Furthermore, a high level of sPLA2-IIA was also a significant predictor of new coronary events during a 2-year follow up period (13Kugiyama K. Ota Y. Takazoe K. Moriyama Y. Kawano H. Miyao Y. Sakamoto T. Soejima H. Ogawa H. Doi H. Sugiyama S. Yasue H. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Earlier immunohistochemistry studies from our group and others indicate that smooth muscle cells are the main source of sPLA2-IIA in human arteries (17Hurt-Camejo E. Anderssen S. Standal R. Rosengren B. Sartipy P. Stadberg E. Johansen B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Elinder L.S. Dumitrescu A. Larsson P. Hedin U.

Atherosclerosis. 1999; 144: 73-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our data from electron microscopy-immunogold examination revealed that the majority of sPLA2-IIA in human atherosclerotic lesions is localized extracellularly associated with collagen fibers and in close contact with extracellular lipid droplets. Intracellular sPLA2-IIA was observed in electron-dense vesicles in the cytosol (20Romano M. Romano E. Björkerud S. Hurt-Camejo E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that sPLA2-IIA may be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. One mechanism by which sPLA2-IIA may be atherogenic is by modifying lipoproteins and releasing inflammatory lipid mediators at places of lipoprotein retention in the arterial wall (21Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 132: 1-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To evaluate the possible biological and pathological function(s) of sPLA2-IIA in the arterial wall it is necessary to clarify the mechanisms regulating its expression and secretion by vascular cells. Inflammatory cytokines that are present in atherosclerotic lesions can regulate genes in cells of the vascular wall cells and macrophages (22Libby P. Galis Z.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 748: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Several in vitro studies indicate that cytokines, such as IL-1-β, IL-6, and TNF-α, can stimulate different cell systems to release sPLA2-IIA (23Pfeilschifter J. Walker G. Kunz D. Pignat W. Bosch H.v.d. Uhl W. Nevalainen T.J. Büchler M.W. Phospholipase A2 Basic and Clinical Aspects in Inflammatory Diseases. 24. Karger, Basel1997: 31-37Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding the effect of IFN-γ on sPLA2-IIA expression. IFN-γ is a potent activator of smooth muscle cells modulating different cell functions related with pathological conditions of the arterial wall (24Hansson G. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 8: 301-311Google Scholar). Furthermore, mRNA transcripts of sPLA2-IIA, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IFN-γ are present in human atherosclerotic lesions together with microbial agents (25Menschikowski M. Rosner-Schiering A. Eckey R. Mueller E. Koch R. Jaross W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Arterial vascular smooth muscle cells can change their phenotype between contractile/non-proliferating and synthetic/proliferating forms. These phenotypic changes are accompanied by changes in gene pattern expression and are associated with the pathological arteriosclerotic process (26Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Curr. Opin. Lipid. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The aims of the present study were two. First, to study the expression of sPLA2-IIA at mRNA and protein level in an in vitro model of phenotypic modulation of HASMC. Second, to investigate the effect of IFN-γ and other pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the transcription and secretion of sPLA2-IIA by HASMC.

Chondroitinase ABC and heparitinase I were purchased from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan. Salts, buffer substances, and detergents used in this work were of analytical grade and were purchased from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, and Bio-Rad. HASMC were isolated from inner media of human uterine arteries and cultured in Waymouth's medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 untis/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 4 mm glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. The medium was changed every 3 days, and cells were detached by treatment with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA solutions. Studies were conducted on HASMC between passage 4 and 9. HASMC were seeded at 5 × 103cells/cm2 in 25- and 80-cm2 cell culture bottles coated with collagen-I in growing medium (27Hurt-Camejo E. Rosengren B. Camejo G. Sartipy P. Fager G. Bondjers G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1456-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After 2 days the medium was removed, cells washed 3 times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and then cultured in Waymouth's medium containing the supplements indicated above but with only 0.5% FBS (serum-poor medium) in order to synchronize the cells by arresting proliferation. After 3 days the medium was removed, cells washed 3 times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and cultured in growing medium for 3–4 days until the cells were confluent. At confluence, cells were stimulated to differentiate in serum-free Waymouth's medium containing the other supplements indicated above (serum-free medium). HASMC were cultured in this medium up to 21 days. Human aortic and pulmonary cells (Clonetics Corp.) were cultured under similar conditions as HASMC. HepG2 liver tumor cells (ATTC, Manassas, VA) were culture in Eagle's modified essential medium containing 10% FBS and supplemented as the growing medium described above. Cells were free of mycoplasma. Endotoxin levels were regularly tested in cell culture medium and cell culture reagents with Coatest/endotoxin, Chromogenix AB (Molndal, Sweden). Levels detected were below 0.01 units/ml. Most experiments were performed after the cells were 7 days in serum-free medium in order to guaranty the expression of both mRNA and protein for sPLA2-IIA. Some experiments with IFN-γ were performed with HASMC preincubated 1 or 3 days in serum-free conditions. HASMC were incubated with cytokines for 4 or 24 h in serum-free medium. The following cytokines concentrations were used: IFN-γ, 50–500 units/ml (1.7–17 ng/ml); IL-6, 10 ng/ml; IL-1β, 10 ng/ml; TNF-α, 500 ng/ml; IL-10 (10 ng/ml). HASMC were extracted with 1 ml/25-cm2 bottle of electrophoresis sample buffer, 0.325m Tris, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, containing 0.1% bromphenol blue, 5 μm AEBSF, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 5 μm aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot were performed as described (17Hurt-Camejo E. Anderssen S. Standal R. Rosengren B. Sartipy P. Stadberg E. Johansen B. Arterioscler. Thromb.

Membranes were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against p27 or p21 from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY (1:2500 and 1:500 dilutions, respectively), and then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000). Immunoreactive bands were detected via chemiluminescence, ECL Western blotting system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Western blot detection of STAT-3 phosphorylation was performed using the PhosphoPlus Stat3 (Tyr705) Antibody Kit from New England BioLabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Total cellular RNA was isolated from HASMC and CHO-cell line expressing human sPLA2-IIA (28Sartipy P. Johansen B. Camejo G. Rosengren B. Bondjers G. Hurt-Camejo E. J. Biol.

Herrera-Sosa H. Gonzalez G. Lee R. Bryan J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). All incubations were done in a Biometra, TRIO-Thermoblock. The PCR products were then separated on a 4% Nusieve GTG-agarose gel, FMC Bioproducts Corp., Rockland, ME. Fluorescent labeled PCR-amplified products. PCR products were subjected to a semiquantitative analysis following the fluorescent labeling method described in ABI PRISM 377, DNA Sequencer GeneScanTMChemistry Guide, Perkin-Elmer. PCR products were labeled on one strand using fluorescent 5′-FAM-labeled sense primers. The labeled strand from the PCR product was separated and detected by running the gel in the ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer, Perkin-Elmer essentially as described by the manufacturer. The relative quantity of the amplified fragments was determined by dividing the peak areas corresponding to the fluorescence of the sPLA2-IIA fragment against the peak area of the GAPDH fragment. GAPDH and sPLA2-IIA fragments were amplified simultaneously in separate PCR reaction tubes. The results presented represent average and standard deviation of three separate GeneScan analyses. Cell-associated and -secreted sPLA2 IIA were measured by enzyme-linked capture antibody immunoassay (32Crowther, J. R. (1995) Methods Mol. Biol.42, pp. 161–175, Human Press, TotowaGoogle Scholar). The antibodies used were: monoclonal antibody against human sPLA2-IIA (1 μg/μl); polyclonal antibody (IgG fraction) against human recombinant sPLA2-IIA developed at the lab with demonstrated no cross-reactivity with PLA2 type V 2Edward A. Dennis, personal communication. or actin; and biotin-Sp-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L). Microtiter plates (Sero-Wel, Bibby Sterilin Ltd. Stone, Staffs, United Kingdom) were coated with the monoclonal antibody against sPLA2-IIA (50 μl/well, 5 μg/ml) in 15 mmsodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, for 18 h in a humid chamber at room temperature. The plates were washed 3 times with 50 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl pH 7.6 (TBS buffer), containing 0.05% Tween 20 (washing buffer). HASMC in a 25-cm2 flask were extracted with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 μm AEBSF, 0.1 mmleupeptin, 5 μm aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. For the ELISA, 50 μl of cell medium or 50 μl of cell extract were added to the wells by quadruplicate and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. This step was repeated once. In total 100 μl of cell extract or media were applied in each well. The plates were washed 3 times with washing buffer, followed by the addition of 1:5000 dilution of polyclonal antibody (IgG fraction) against human recombinant sPLA2-IIA, and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were then washed 3 times and incubated with 1:5000 dilution of biotin-SP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at 37 °C. All the antibodies were diluted in TBS buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 (incubation buffer). The plates were washed 3 times with washing buffer followed by the addition of 50 μl/well of the peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin diluted 1:2000 in incubation buffer and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. Then the plates were washed again, followed by the addition of 50 μl/well of substrate azino diethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (22 mg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C after which the plates were read at 405 nm (Spectra MAX Plus Microplate Spectrophotometer System, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Purified human recombinant sPLA2-IIA (28Sartipy P. Johansen B. Camejo G. Rosengren B. Bondjers G. Hurt-Camejo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26307-26314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was used to generate a standard curve (62.5–2000 pg/50 μl/well). HASMC cell media were concentrated 10 times with Centricon-10 concentrates (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) and incubated 4 h withl-3-phosphatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]lineoyl as substrate (50–62 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). PLA2 activity was assayed essentially as described (33Wu T. Levine S.J. Lawrence M.G. Logun C. Angus C.W. Shelhamer J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A calibration curve with different concentrations of human recombinant sPLA2-IIA was performed in parallel. Based in this curve, PLA2 activity from HASMC was expressed as the concentration of sPLA2-IIA (ng/ml) in non-concentrated cell media responsible for the release of14C-labeled nonesterified fatty acids NEFA. HASMC were incubated with or without cytokines as described above. After 4 and 24 h incubation cell nuclear extract were prepared. Nuclear extract preparation, annealing, and purification of oligonucleotides and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were performed as described (34Ohlsson B.G. Englund M.C.O. Karlsson A.-L.K. Knutsen E. Erixon C. Skribeck H. Liu Y. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 78-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Life Technology, Ltd., Paisley, UK. Double-stranded oligonucleotides identical to the sequences from −563 to −535 and −240 to −208 in the human sPLA2-IIA promoter, containing a NF-κB and STAT-binding site, respectively, were used. In some experiments for identification of nuclear transcription factors in the EMSA assay, rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) against the p65 subunit of NF-κB and against STAT 1, 3, 5, and 6 proteins were added to the EMSA binding reactions. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein analysis kits (Bio-Rad). Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Each experiment was performed at least 3 times. The results obtained were reproducible between experiments. Variation in the total levels of sPLA2-IIA expression, mRNA, secretion, and cell associated, could be observed sometimes between batches of HASMC. Each data point represent n = 3 or 4. Individual statistical comparisons of paired data were evaluated by Student's ttest with p ≤ 0.05 representing significance. Standard curves and statistical analysis of the results were performed using GraphPad Prism, v2.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To investigate the regulation of sPLA2-IIA expression in HASMC, we used an in vitro model of phenotypic modulation or differentiation in culture shown in Fig. 1 and described under “Experimental Procedures.” We studied the following parameters: 1) growth of the cells by determination of cell number and DNA synthesis; 2) cell morphology; 3) expression of the cell differentiation markers, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors of mammalian cell cycle p27 and p21 and heavy caldesmon, a marker of human smooth muscle cell differentiation. As shown in Fig.2 A after 3 days of cell synchronization in 0.5% FBS (serum-poor medium) there was a marked reduction in DNA synthesis with little change in cells numbers. These results reflect the expected reduction in proliferation rate of confluent cells cultured in the absence of serum. Phase-contrast microscopy showed no morphological changes between HASMC maintained 1, 3, 7, and 14 days in serum-free medium (Fig. 2 B). These HASMC cultures were judged as normal dense cultures of fully confluent spindle shaped cells.Figure 2Proliferation and DNA synthesis curves. A, HASMC were cultured following the protocol schematized in Fig. 1 and described under “Experimental Procedures.” The number of cells (left) and the synthesis of DNA (right) by bromodeoxyuridine ELISA were determined after different times during cell culture.

Representative photographs taken with phase-contrast microscopy of HASMC cultures as in Fig. 1 after 1 day (1D), 3 days (3D), 7 days (7D), and 14 days (14D) of continual incubation in serum-free or serum-poor medium to stop proliferation and stimulate cell differentiation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression of p27 and p21 cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk2) inhibitors, as markers of cell differentiation, was evaluated by Western blot analysis of cell extracts. As shown in Fig.3 A p27 protein was not detected in HASMC after 2 days in 10% FBS when proliferation was as highest, whereas the same cells after 1 or 14 days in defined serum-free medium (non-proliferating conditions) showed as expected a markedly increase in the expression of p27. The p21 protein was detected under proliferating and non-proliferating conditions, however, its expression was increased after 1-day culture in serum-free medium. We also analyzed the mRNA level for heavy caldesmon, a marker of smooth muscle cell differentiation found in the vascular wall, in parallel to analysis of mRNA for sPLA2-IIA and GAPDH. PCR-amplified fragments showed the corresponding size of the different fragments and only one well defined band was amplified (Fig.3 B). These results shown that post-confluent HASMC expression of sPLA2-IIA and heavy caldesmon mRNA increased significantly after 7 and 14 days in culture in serum-free medium. In contrast, the levels of GAPDH mRNA remained constant during culture. These observations indicate that the in vitro protocol used for culture of HASMC lead the cells to a quiescent, differentiated state that promotes expression of sPLA2-IIA. Similar results were observed with human smooth muscle cells from aorta and pulmonary artery (data not shown). Analysis of mRNA content by semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that subconfluent proliferating cells cultured in growing medium (3-day 10% FBS) and confluent cells after 1 day in defined serum-free medium (1-day 0% FBS), exhibited a low constitutive expression of sPLA2-IIA (Fig.4 A). When these cells were switched to defined serum-free medium, we observed a time-dependent increase in the mRNA content of sPLA2-IIA after 3 days that remained constant up to 14 days in culture. The results of sPLA2-IIA protein levels presented in Fig. 4, B and C, indicate that similar to the mRNA levels, culture of confluent cells in defined serum-free medium induced a time-dependent increase in the cell-secreted and cell-associated protein content of sPLA2-IIA. Despite an increase in sPLA2-IIA mRNA levels no sPLA2-IIA protein could be detected in cell media or associated to the cells after 3 days in serum-free media (3-day 0%). A significant increase in sPLA2-IIA cell-associated protein was observed after 7 days (2–2.5-fold) that continued up to 14 days of culture in serum-free medium, where after, sPLA2-IIA protein levels started to decrease. The amount and period of sPLA2-IIA secretion varied between different batches of HASMC. In some cultures, secretion was highest after 7 days in serum-free medium. To further investigate if this increase in sPLA2-IIA mRNA and cell-associated protein levels in culture was due to the absence of serum, cells expressing sPLA2-IIA after 5 or 7 days in defined serum-free medium were switched to 10% FBS growing medium. In these cells sPLA2-IIA mRNA, secreted and cell-associated sPLA2-IIA protein levels decreased (Fig. 4, A,B, and C). In contrast, an i"

Recently, some groups reported in vitro reconstitution of telomerase and demonstrated the essential role of hTERT and human telomere RNA, hTR, as an RNA template (17.Beattie T.L. Zhou W.

Another group reported that the production of active recombinant telomerase of Tetrahymena requires a factor in rabbit reticulocyte extract that promotes ribonucleoprotein assembly (21.Licht J.D.

In these systems, certain factor(s) carried over with rabbit reticulocytes may influence the native telomerase activity. Therefore, it remains unclear whether these two components, hTERT and hTR, are sufficient for in vitro telomerase reconstitution. The production of purified hTERT and hTR is necessary to answer this question and to provide an experimental system in which to identify factors that are essential for or that stimulate telomerase activityin vitro. Here, we report a method of expression and purification that allows recovery of a large amount of the soluble form of FLAG-tagged hTERT from insect cells infected with hTERT expression recombinant baculovirus. We demonstrated that the partially purified FLAG-hTERT and hTR retained the authentic catalytic activity of telomerase that was further stimulated by some factors in telomerase-negative cell extracts. Sf9 cells and the BaculoGold Starter Package including BaculoGold linear baculovirus DNA were purchased from PharMingen Co. Ltd. High5 cells were purchased from Invitrogen Co. Ltd. Sf9 cells were grown in suspension in TNM-FH insect medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. High5 cells were also grown in suspension in High5 serum-free medium (Invitrogen Co. Ltd.). The EcoRI-SalI fragment containing the hTERT cDNA was subcloned from pCI-Neo-hTERT, which was kindly provided by Dr. Robert A. Weinberg (Whitehead Institute, MIT). This fragment was subcloned into theEcoRI-SalI sites of the plasmid pNKZ-FLAG (23.Yamashita T. Kaneko S. Shirota Y. Qin W. Nomura T. Kobayashi K. Murakami S. J. Biol.

Other components for co-transfection were as recommended by the manufacturer (PharMingen Co. Ltd.). The cells were incubated for 5 days at 27 °C, and the supernatant was used for amplification of the FLAG-hTERT expression recombinant virus, BVKM-FLAG-hTERT, on Sf9 cells. The recombinant viruses amplified on Sf9 cells were titered by plaque assay as according to the manufacturer's protocol. High titer suspensions of BVKM-FLAG-hTERT (>1.0 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml) were used for infection of High5 cells. For expression of FLAG-hTERT protein, aliquots of 1.0 × 107 High5 cells were seeded onto 5 × 25-cm2 dishes before infection. The cells were infected with BVKM-FLAG-hTERT at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of about 0.2. These infected High5 cells were incubated for 5 days at 27 °C and then scraped off the plates and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C, and all buffers contained 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10 μg/ml phenanthrorin (Sigma), 16 μg/ml benzamidine (Sigma), and 1 mm DTT (Nakalai Tesque Co.

The collected cells were resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), and the suspension was sonicated three times for 10 s each time (26.Acker J. de Graaff M.

The suspension was sonicated three times for 10 s each time, and after a 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g, the supernatant (S3) was collected together with S2. These fractions were diluted with buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol, 0.5% MEGA-9, 1 mm DTT) to adjust NaCl concentration to 100 mm(S4). S4 was passed through a DEAE-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol, 0.5% MEGA-9, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT). One ml of 50% heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer E was added to each flow-through fraction. This mixture was rotated for 3–4 h at 4 °C. Protein bound to heparin-Sepharose was washed with buffer E and then eluted with 2 ml of buffer B. To quantify the purified FLAG-tagged hTERT protein, protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (8% polyacrylamide gel), and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The sample eluted from heparin-Sepharose was used for all telomerase assays. Western blotting was performed by the standard method with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) (23.Yamashita T.

Telomerase-negative TIG3 cells (purchased from the Health Science Research Resources Bank, Japan) were cultured by the standard method in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. These cells were treated with lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% MEGA-9, 25% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm KCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmDTT, and 10 units/μl RNasin, and aliquots of the cell extracts were stored at −80 °C (6.Nakayama J.

Shionoya S. Sato H. Omine M. Ishikawa F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2265-2274PubMed Google Scholar). The TIG3 cell extract and FLAG-hTERT were mixed with or without hTR in a total volume of 20 μl and incubated at 33 °C for 1 h for telomerase reaction. Telomerase activity was detected using the two methods described above. Complementation assay of telomerase activity with TIG3 extract and in vitro reconstitution of human telomerase were performed with the benzoquinone ansamysin, GA (Calbiochem). Increasing amounts of GA were added after the assembly step (preincubation), and telomerase reactions were carried out. Plasmids pGRN164 and pSG5UTPL-p53 linearized withFspI and with BalI, respectively, were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase using the RiboMAX RNA Production System (Promega Co. Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's protocol except reaction mixtures contained 1 μl of 10 μCi/μl [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding reactions were performed at 33 °C for 1 h by incubation of various amounts of FLG-hTERT and 2 ng of labeled RNA in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25% glycerol, 4 mmMgCl2, 3 mm KCl, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 10 units/μl RNasin). Competition analyses were performed with excess unlabeled probe. We were unable to express and purify hTERT by several methods using bacterial expression systems (data not shown). A baculovirus system was therefore applied to express hTERT in insect cells. We compared the expression level of FLAG-hTERT in Sf9 cells with that in High5 cells infected with the recombinant virus BVKM-FLAG-hTERT. The expression level of FLAG-hTERT was much higher in High5 than in Sf9 cells, and therefore we chose the High5 cells to express FLAG-hTERT. The amount of expressed FLAG-hTERT in High5 cells infected with BVKM-FLAG-hTERT at a m.o.i. of 0.2 was similar to or slightly higher than those in cultures infected with the virus at m.o.i. of 5–10 (Fig.1, A and B). Lesser amounts of the recombinant protein were recovered at lower m.o.i. values such as 0.1 and 0.02 (data not shown); thus, the optimal m.o.i. seemed to be around 0.2. The time course of changes in expression level of FLAG-hTERT in High5 cells infected with BVKM-FLAG-hTERT at m.o.i. 0.2 was determined. The expression levels of the protein were almost similar during day 4–6 after infection and were higher than those at day 2 and 3 (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, the conditions used for efficient expression of FLAG-hTERT using High5 cells had an m.o.i. of around 0.2 and a harvest time around 5 days after infection. These optimum conditions were different from the recommended conditions, m.o.i. of around 5–10, and harvest time from 48 to 72 h after infection, which may have been because of the slow doubling time of the infected cells (data not shown) (28.O'Reilly D. Millar L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). The recombinant virus, BVKM-FLAG-hTERT, was stable for more than 6 months at 4 °C without significant reduction of its titer. Recombinant FLAG-hTERT expressed by insect cells was poorly solubilized in buffers containing several kinds of detergents including Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, and CHAPS, and low or moderate concentrations of salt. However, we found that FLAG-hTERT could be solubilized in buffer containing a high salt concentration and the nonionic detergent MEGA-9 (29.Hildreth J.E. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30.Hanatani M. Nishifuji K. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We exploited this property to partially purify the FLAG-hTERT proteins first using buffers in which most cellular protein could be solubilized (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1, 3, and 5). Under these conditions, the majority of FLAG-hTERT protein remained in the pellet but could be eluted by a subsequent step using high stringency buffer (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 6). As shown in Fig. 2 A, most of the cellular proteins were eluted from the cell pellet with buffers containing low concentrations of Nonidet P-40, glycerol, and NaCl (Fig. 2 A, S1, S2, and see “Experimental Procedures”). In contrast, FLAG-hTERT was eluted efficiently only with the buffer containing MEGA-9 and high salt (Fig. 2 A, S2 and S3). Therefore, FLAG-hTERT was enriched in S2 and S3. We attempted to purify the protein from these supernatants (S4 also see “Experimental Procedures”) with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2-bound Sepharose (Kodak Bioscientific Imaging Systems Co. Ltd.), but the recombinant FLAG-hTERT protein could not be immunoprecipitated by this procedure (data not shown). The FLAG-hTERT fractionated by SDS-PAGE was successfully detected by Western blotting using M2 antibody (Figs. 1 B and 2 C). These results strongly suggested that the FLAG tag at the N terminus is not exposed in native FLAG-hTERT but is exposed under denaturing conditions. Therefore we attempted to partially purify the FLAG-hTERT (see “Experimental Procedures”) by heparin column chromatography based on the properties of hTERT (3.Morin G.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 521-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 18.Weinrich S.L. Pruzan R. Ma L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E. Bodnar A.G. Lichtsteiner S. Kim N.W. Trager J.B.

FLAG-hTERT was found to bind heparin-Sepharose and was eluted from the resin with high concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 2, B, lane 10, andC). Similarly, FLAG-hTERT can bind poly(U)-Sepharose 4B with a similar efficiency to heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (data not shown). We attempted to detect telomerase activity of the purified FLAG-hTERT (heparin-Sepharose fraction) and in vitrotranscribed hTR (see “Experimental Procedures”) reconstitutedin vitro. Telomerase activity was detected by TRAP assay only when FLAG-hTERT and hTR were present although FLAG-hTERT alone exhibited no activity (Fig.3 A). This result indicates that the reconstituted components in vitro exhibited telomerase activity. The telomere synthesis was observed after a lag time of 10 min and continued for at least 1 h in an apparently linear fashion at 33 °C as determined by TRAP assay (Fig.3 C). Maximum catalytic activity of FLAG-hTERT occurs at a reaction temperature between 30 °C and 37 °C, and the activity requires the presence of magnesium ions at 4 mm (data not shown). The telomerase activity of the reconstituted componentsin vitro was examined by another in vitro assay, TRAP ELISA (see “Experimental Procedures”), to measure telomerase activity quantitatively in the presence of varying molar ratios of the recombinant FLAG-hTERT and hTR (Fig. 3 B). Maximum telomerase activity was observed when the two components, FLAG-hTERT and hTR, were present at approximately equimolar ratio in the reaction. Judging from the results obtained by these two methods, reconstitution of equimolar amounts of FLAG-hTERT and hTR seemed to occur resulting in the optimal telomerase activity, suggesting efficient complex formation of the two components in vitro. TERT has been reported to be a rate-limiting factor for telomerase activity in cultured cell lines (6.Nakayama J. Tahara H. Tahara E. Saito M. Ito K. Nakamura H. Nakanishi T. Ide T. Ishikawa F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). We examined whether the catalytic activity of FLAG-hTERT could complement that missing in telomerase-negative cell extracts. We constructed a mutant FLAG-hTERT baculovirus expression plasmid (see “Experimental Procedures”), in which the VDV motif was replaced by VAV. FLAG-hTERT and FLAG-hTERT(D712A) were expressed in insect cells and purified (Fig. 4 A), and total cell extracts were prepared from the telomerase-negative normal human fibroblast cell line (TIG3). Neither TIG3 cell extract nor the purified FLAG-hTERT alone showed any telomerase activity (Figs.4 B, lane 3, and 3 A, lane 2). The wild-type FLAG-hTERT exhibited telomerase activity only when the TIG3 cell extract was added, whereas the mutant protein, FLAG-hTERT(D712A), showed no telomerase activity even in the presence of the cell extract (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and5). The catalytic activity of FLAG-hTERT was necessary to complement the telomerase-negative cell extracts because the wild-type FLAG-hTERT and not the mutant FLAG-hTERT (D712A), complemented the telomerase-negative TIG3 cell extract. FLAG-hTERT(D712A) showed no catalytic activity in the reconstitution assay (data not shown).Figure 5Effects of GA on telomerase activity.Telomerase activity was measured by TRAP assay (A) and TRAP ELISA (B, see “Experimental Procedures”). FLAG-hTERT (5 ng), hTR (9 ng), and TIG3 extract from 104cells were added (A, lanes 1–3, andB, columns 1–3) in the absence or the presence of increasing concentrations of GA as shown in A. In vitro reconstituted telomerase activity was measured with FLAG-hTERT (90 ng) and hTR (150 ng) (A, lanes 4–6, and B, columns 4–6) in the absence or the presence of increasing concentrations of GA as shown inA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If hTR is the only factor supplied by TIG3 extract for telomerase activity, telomerase activity reconstituted in vitro may not be affected in the presence of TIG3 extract. Interestingly, TIG3 extract strongly augmented telomerase activity reconstituted with FLAG-hTERT and hTR in vitro as determined by two assays (Fig. 4, C and D). The TIG3 extract augmented telomerase activity of a small amount of reconstituted FLAG-hTERT and hTR (5 ng each) by more than 30-fold in a dose-dependent manner. This suggested that there are some factors in TIG3 extract that stimulate the activity of telomerase reconstituted in vitro. Hsp90 and p23 have been reported to be essential for telomerase activity with recombinant hTERT synthesized in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte extract (20.Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The effects of a specific inhibitor of Hsp90, GA, on the activity of the reconstituted telomerase were examined in the absence or presence of TIG3 cell extract. GA inhibited the telomerase activity stimulated by the TIG3 extract only at higher concentrations (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–3, by TRAP assay, and Fig. 5 B, columns 1–3, by TRAP ELISA). In contrast, the telomerase activity was not inhibited by geldanamycin at higher concentrations (up to 100 μg/ml) when added before (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–6, by TRAP assay, and Fig. 5 B, columns 4–6, by TRAP ELISA) or after (data not shown) reconstitution of FLAG-hTERT and hTR in vitro. Consistent with this result, Hsp90 was not detected in the purified preparation of FLAG-hTERT by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining (Fig. 2 B, lane 10, and Fig.4 A) and anti-Hsp90 antibody (data not shown). The complex formation of FLAG-hTERT and hTR in vitro was directly examined by EMSA. 32P-Labeled probes for hTR (483 nucleotide) and a control RNA, SG-RNA (560 nucleotide), were prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. The hTR probe made multimeric forms in the absence of protein in native gels probably because of intermolecular interaction of hTR (Fig.6, A and B). These free bands of hTR were diminished by FLAG-hTERT in a dose-dependent manner, and instead the specific complex formation of the labeled hTR probe was observed correlated with an increasing portion of the probe not entered in gel. These complexes were eliminated by an excess amount of nonlabeled hTR but not by the control RNA (indicated by the arrowhead and arrowin Fig. 6 B). Neither complex formation nor the portion not entering the gel was observed with the control RNA probe and FLAG-hTERT or with the hTR probe and glutathione S-transferase (Fig.6 B, lanes 11–16). These results strongly suggested that FLAG-hTERT and hTR formed a specific complex and that the complex may consist of equimolar amounts of the two components because almost no free probe was observed when equimolar amounts of FLAG-hTERT and hTR were present (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). Telomerase is present in germ cells but is repressed in most human somatic cells during development (1.Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3109-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Induction of hTERT overcame senescence and extended the lifespan of normal human primary cells, and ectopic expression of hTERT in combination with two oncogenes results in direct tumorigenic conversion of normal human epithelial and fibroblast cells (8.Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar, 16.Hahn W.C. Counter C.M. Lundberg A.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Brooks M.W. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1999; 400: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar). These results suggested an important role of hTERT in preventing cell senescence and in carcinogenesis. Thus, hTERT is therefore a likely target for methods to prevent cell senescence or carcinogenesis. Here, we established a method to express and purify a large amount of soluble recombinant hTERT. Attempts to express and purify bacterial recombinant hTERT were not successful, and therefore the baculovirus expression system was applied. The expression level of FLAG-hTERT was very low in Sf9 cells, but we found efficient expression in High5 cells (37.Davis T.R. Wickham T.J. McKenna K.A. Granados R.R. Shuler M.L. Wood H.A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1993; 29: 388-390Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The reason for the efficient expression of FLAG-hTERT in High5 cells is not clear at present; however, we chose optimal m.o.i. and better harvesting time that were different from those recommended in the standard protocol (28.O'Reilly D. Millar L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). This efficiency of expression may have been because of the slow growth rate of the cells infected with BVKM-FLAG-hTERT. The recombinant FLAG-hTERT protein was recovered at 2.0 mg/108 infected cells, a level not much different from those of other recombinant proteins. hTERT could be solubilized only with the nonionic detergent MEGA-9 in the presence of high salt concentrations (29.Hildreth J.E. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30.Hanatani M. Nishifuji K. Futai M. Tsuchiya T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We constructed hTERT tagged at the N terminus with FLAG because C-terminal tagging with the hemagglutinin epitope tag prevents the biological activity of telomerase (9.Counter C.M. Hahn W.C. Wei W. Caddle S.D. Beijersbergen R.L. Lansdorp P.M. Sedivy J.M. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14723-14728Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The FLAG epitope seemed to not be exposed under native conditions because the soluble recombinant FLAG-hTERT was not recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody M2, but FLAG-hTERT fractionated by SDS-PAGE was successfully recognized by Western blotting using the same antibody. Although the other FLAG-tagged hTERT was successfully immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody in a previous study, the latter recombinant hTERT was tagged at the C terminus (7.Harrington L. Zhou W. McPhail T. Oulton R. Yeung D.S. Mar V. Bass M.B. Robinson M.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3109-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Here, we clearly showed that the purified recombinant FLAG-hTERT retained the catalytic activity of human telomerase detected in different assays. Our results are the first indicating that hTERT and hTR are the minimal essential components for telomerase activityin vitro. Efficient complex formation was detected by EMSA assay when equimolar amounts of hTR and FLAG-hTERT were mixed, and the maximum telomerase activity was observed with the reconstituted components. However, for detection by TRAP assay, higher amounts of the reconstituted telomerase were required. The active form of telomerase may require proper folding or multimerization of the complex, which can be facilitated by auxiliary factors or complexes. The telomerase activity of the reconstituted components was augmented by more than 30-fold in the presence of telomerase-negative TIG3 cell extract. A similar stimulatory effect of cell extract was also observed with another telomerase-negative cell line, IMR-90, and in the complementation assay in vitro (data not shown). The telomerase-negative extract might contain some component(s) capable of stimulating telomerase activity reconstituted in vitro. Holtet al. (20.Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) proposed that Hsp90 and p23 are essential components for telomerase activity reconstituted in vitrousing hTR and hTERT synthesized with rabbit reticulocyte extract. Our results showed that GA partially inhibited the stimulated telomerase activity in the presence of the cell extract but did not affect the telomerase activity of the two components reconstituted in vitro. The partial inhibition of GA on the stimulated telomerase activity was consistent with their results, although we demonstrated that purified hTERT and hTR exhibited telomerase activity. Active telomerase may be detected only when hTERT and hTR are present at higher concentrations. The GA resistant stimulatory effect of the TIG3 extract implied the presence of some component(s) in addition to Hsp90 and p23 required for the reconstituted telomerase. TERT and TR have been reported to interact with other components to form a ribonucleoprotein complex. The component(s) in ribonucleoprotein are different in different organisms, e.g. p43 inEuplotes (38.Hammond P.W. Lively T.N. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell.

The assay using reconstituted telomerase may serve as an experimental tool to identify factors with stimulatory effects on telomerase. The baculovirus expression system and the purification method reported here will be useful not only for studies to determine the molecular functions and structure of telomerase but also for development of strategies of drug design targeting hTERT, which is a good strong candidate to prevent cell senescence and carcinogenesis.

We have previously solved the structures of domains II and III, which stimulate arrested polymerase II elongation complexes in order to resume transcription. Domain I is conserved in evolution from yeast to human species and is homologous to the transcription factors elongin A and CRSP70. Domain I also interacts with the transcriptionally active RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and therefore, may have a function unrelated to the previously described transcription elongation activity of TFIIS. We have solved the structure of domain I of yeast TFIIS using NMR spectroscopy. Domain I is a compact four-helix bundle that is structurally independent of domains II and III of the TFIIS. Using the yeast structure as a template, we have modeled the homologous domains from elongin A and CRSP70 and identified a conserved positively charged patch on the surface of all three proteins, which may be involved in conserved functional interactions with the transcriptional machinery.

TFIIS is conserved from yeast to man, and homologs are found in Archaea and in some viral genomes. TFIIS comprises three structural domains termed I, II, and III. A fragment consisting of domains II and III is sufficient for elongation activity in vitro and is able to rescue the phenotype of a TFIIS gene disruption in yeast cells. Domain II (residues 131–240) mediates the interaction with the largest subunit of RNA polymerase. Domain III (residues 264–309), a small zinc-ribbon motif, is implicated in the stimulation of transcript cleavage and resumption of transcription by RNA polymerase II (2Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N.

Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and CRSP70 (6Ryu S. Zhou S. Ladurner A.G. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 397: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), both of which are involved in transcription. Elongin is a transcription elongation factor that increases the rate of transcription by suppressing transient pausing of the elongation complex (7Shilatifard A. FASEB. 1998; 12: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). CRSP70 is an essential subunit of the CRSP complex, which is required for the activity of the enhancer-binding protein Sp1 (4Pan G. Aso T. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24563-24571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Third, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TFIIS lacking domain I is synthetically lethal with a disruption of theTFG3 gene. Domains II and III, which are sufficient to reactivate arrested transcription complexes, are not able to complement the synthetic lethality with TFG3. 2J. Davie and C. M. Kane, personal communication. TFG3 is a component of the general transcription factors TFIIF and TFIID and swi/SNF, a complex required for full activity of several transcription activators (8Kadonaga J. Cell. 1998; 92: 307-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Thus, biochemical and genetic studies of the N terminus of TFIIS suggest a role in transcription. As yet, the functions of the N-terminal domain of TFIIS, elongin, or CRSP70 are not known. To help elucidate the function of this domain and to provide a structural framework for the design and interpretation of additional studies, we determined the solution structure of domain I of S. cerevisiae TFIIS and used this structure to model the N-terminal domains of elongin A, and CRSP70. Sequences coding for residues 1 to 111 of yeast (S. cerevisiae) TFIIS were cloned into the T7 polymerase expression vector pET15b (Novagen), as described in Morin et al. (9Morin P. Awrey D. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10604-10608Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and expressed as C-terminal fusions to an N-terminal His6 tag and a thrombin protease site. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells expressing the TFIIS fragment were grown in M9 minimal medium (3Olmsted V.K. Awrey D.E. Koth C. Shan X. Morin P.E. Kazanis S. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22589-22594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) containing15N-labeled NH4Cl and for13C-labeled samples, 13C-labeled glucose. Cells were grown at 30 °C to an absorbance of 0.4 at 600 nm, and protein expression was induced with 1.0 mmisopropyl-6-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Three hours after induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in Buffer A (30 mm Hepes, 600 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl, 1.0 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5) with 5 mm imidazole and frozen at −70 °C. The cells were lysed using a French pressure cell, and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The supernatant solution was loaded onto a (5 × 5)-cm DE52 (Whatman, Maidstone, UK) column, and equilibrated in Buffer A. The flow-through was loaded onto a (1 × 4)-cm Ni2+ column and washed extensively with Buffer A with 30 mm imidazole, and then the TFIIS was eluted with Buffer A and 500 mm imidazole. The histidine tag was removed by incubation with thrombin (1:1000, w/w) in 2.5 mm CaCl2, and the sample was dialyzed into NMR buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm EDTA, 10 μm ZnSO4, pH 7.5). TFIIS was then further purified using gel filtration (Superdex-75 preparation grade column) and concentrated to 2 mm by ultrafiltration. For NMR experiments requiring a D2O sample, the protein was lyophilized and redissolved in 99.9% D2O. All NMR spectra were collected at 25 °C on either a Varian 500-MHz or 600-MHz Inova spectrometer equipped with pulse field gradient units and actively shielded z-gradient triple-resonance probes. NMR experiments involving correlations of amide protons were acquired with gradient enhanced versions (10Kay L.E. Keifer P. Sarrinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2433) Google Scholar) of the originally published pulse sequences. NMR data were processed using nmrPipe software (11Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar). Spectral analysis was assisted using the programs Pipp and Capp (12Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar) and NMRView (13Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific assignment of 1HN, 15N,13Cα and 13Cβresonances for all non-proline residues of TFIIS was achieved through correlations from CBCA(CO)NH (14Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), CBCANH (15Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Yamazaki T. J. Magn. Reson. Ser.

Lyons B.A. Emerson S.D. Tashiro M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10974Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and an 15N TOCSY-HSQC (20Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar) (mixing time, 81 ms). Homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY (21Jeener J. Meier B.H. Backmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4838) Google Scholar) and TOCSY (22Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3108) Google Scholar) spectra in D20 were used to assign side chain1H resonances of aromatic residues. H–H nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) were identified from the following spectra:13C, 15N-edited NOESY in H20 (16Pascal S. Muhandiram R.D. Yamazaki T., J.D., F.-K. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 101: 197-201Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar) (both mixing times are 150 ms) and homonuclear NOESY in D2O. An HNHA was used to measure3JNH-Hα coupling (23Kay L.E. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 86: 110Google Scholar). Structure calculations were performed using version 3.851 of XPLOR with ambiguous restraints for iterative assignment (ARIA) (24Nilges M. Macias M. O'Donoghue S. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The initial input for ARIA consisted of the eight lowest energy structures calculated by XPLOR using 276 unambiguous manually assigned NOEs, dihedral angle restraints, and hydrogen bond restraints. The dihedral restraints were based on the predictions of TALOS (25Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biolmol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). All TALOS-derived restraints were consistent with the secondary structure as determined from3JNH-Hα measurements, NOE patterns, and Hα and Cα chemical shifts. These indicated an α-helical conformation for residues 3–16, 20–31, 41–53, and 60–75. Hydrogen bond restraints (H···O, 2.5 Å; N···O, 3.5 Å) were added for residues which were clearly α-helical as judged by NOE patterns, chemical shift values, and lower rates of amide hydrogen exchange. The CN-NOESY, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and homonuclear two-dimensional NOESY were automatically peak picked using NMRView (13Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar) followed by manual removal of obvious artifacts. The resulting NOE peak lists were used as input for ARIA calculations. The frequency window tolerance for assigning NOEs with ARIA was ±0.03 ppm for all proton dimensions and ±0.5 ppm in the nitrogen and carbon dimensions. The ARIA parameters p, T v andN v were as in Nilges et al. (24Nilges M. Macias M. O'Donoghue S. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In each iteration, 20 structures were refined, and the 7 lowest energy structures were used for the purposes of NOE assignments. In the final (eighth) ARIA iteration, 20 structures were refined, and the 10 lowest energy structures were retained for analysis. A total of 1199 unambiguous and 542 ambiguous NOE-based distance restraints were used for the final set of structures. Homology modeling of human TFIIS, elongin A, and CRSP70 using the yeast structure as a template was performed using the “optimize” option of SWISS-MODEL Version 3.5 (26Peitsh M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment was generated using the multiple sequence alignment program Clustal W1.8 (27Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar) and edited slightly by hand to optimize the alignment over the helices in favor of aligning over the loops. Surface charge plots were produced using GRASP (28Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar). Partial proteolysis studies revealed that the N-terminal region of yeast TFIIS consists of a stable structural domain. This domain extended from the N terminus of TFIIS to the region between residues 105 and 124 (9Morin P. Awrey D. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10604-10608Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To identify the fragment of domain I most suitable for structural studies, three TFIIS constructs containing residues 1–93, 1–111, and 1–124 were prepared, and the resulting15N-labeled proteins tested for feasibility by NMR. The TFIIS-(1–111) construct containing the conserved residues was expressed well, was stable for several weeks, and had all the dispersed HSQC peaks (characteristic of residues in structured parts of the protein) that were observed in the longer TFIIS-(1–124) construct. The TFIIS-(1–111) construct was selected for structure determination. Domain I of TFIIS formed a four-helix bundle (Fig.1). The helices are each 12 to 13 residues long and are connected by structured loops of length 4, 9, and 6 residues. Residues 78–111 are unstructured. The structure of domain I is likely to be conserved in elongin and CRSP70. The hydrophobic core residues of helices 2, 3, and 4 are well conserved among TFIIS, elongin, and CRSP70, although helix 1 is less conserved (Fig.2). The DALI data base (29Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar) revealed that the closest structural homolog is the A chain of cytochromec oxidase (Z-score = 4.1, root mean squared deviation (RMSD) = 2.7), which is also a four-helix bundle although its helices are much longer than those of TFIIS.Figure 2Sequence alignment of TFIIS domain I. Dark gray indicates identical residues and light gray, homologous residues. The positions of the helices are shown above the sequence and asterisks indicate the residues that form the hydrophobic core.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The surfaces of the proteins were examined to identify regions that might participate in functional interactions. The structures of proteins were modeled with SWISS-MODEL Version 3.5 (26Peitsh M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) using the yeast TFIIS structure as a template. The reliability of the models depends on the degree of sequence identity between the template and model sequences. The models are expected to be accurate for human TFIIS and helices 2, 3, and 4 of elongin A and CRSP70 because these helices share high sequence homology with the TFIIS structure. The modeled structures are likely to be poorer in helix 1 because the sequence homology in this region is lower.

Open table in a new tab TFIIS and human elongin A both bind the transcription holoenzyme. To indicate what part of the proteins might be responsible for binding, we looked for surface features conserved between these two proteins (Fig.3). Several surface residues are conserved in TFIIS and elongin: Leu-7, Asn-12, Glu-14, Asn-19, Leu-24, Thr-37, Leu-41, Val-46, Lys-54, Lys-55, Lys-66, Met-68, Ile-76, and Lys-73. All of these residues with the exception of Lys-73 are also conserved in CRSP70. Several of these residues localize to the top of the helix bundle and the face of the protein formed by helices 1 and 3. These form a basic patch, which is most extensive in human TFIIS. The charged nature of this conserved patch makes it a likely candidate for the location of an interaction common to TFIIS, elongin, and CRSP70. Other than this basic patch, the surface charge properties vary considerably between the proteins. This may reflect binding of different targets or may indicate that the remainder of the surface is not functionally important. Helix 2 and 4 of CRSP70 and elongin A have basic patches that are not found in TFIIS. In vertebrates, TFIIS is expressed in several distinct isoforms where one seems to be a general form and one is testes-specific (30Labhart P. Morgan G.T. Genomics. 1998; 52: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One main difference between the isoforms is the length of the region linking domains I and II. Perhaps changing the length of this linker may modify the function of TFIIS by changing the configuration and orientation of proteins within TFIIS-containing complexes. In conclusion, we have solved the structure of yeast TFIIS and shown that the overall fold of this domain is conserved among TFIIS, elongin A, and CRSP70. We modeled the homologous proteins using the yeast structure as a template and identified a conserved patch of charge, which may be involved in functional interactions common to all three proteins."

Herein we describe the cloning and characterization of a peroxisomal NADPH-specifictrans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, the key enzyme for a proposed peroxisomal chain elongation pathway. The reductase was solubilized and partially purified from guinea pig liver peroxisomes by affinity chromatography. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a 40-kDa band was identified as the enzyme, and its partial amino acid sequence (27 amino acids) was determined. A full-length cDNA for the reductase was cloned from a guinea pig liver cDNA library. The open reading frame of this nucleotide sequence encodes a 302-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 32.5 kDa. Full-length mouse and human cDNA clones encoding homologous proteins have also been isolated. All of these translated polypeptides have the type I peroxisomal targeting signal, AKL, at the carboxyl terminus. The identity of the cloned enoyl-CoA reductase cDNAs was confirmed by expressing the guinea pig and human cDNAs in Escherichia coli. The His-tagged recombinant enzymes were found to have very high NADPH-specific 2-enoyl-CoA reductase activity with similar properties and specificity as the liver peroxisomal reductase. Both the natural and the recombinant enzyme catalyze the reduction oftrans-2-enoyl-CoAs of varying chain lengths from 6:1 to 16:1, having maximum activity with 10:1 CoA. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that a single transcript of 1.3 kilobases is present in most mouse tissues, with particularly high concentrations in liver and kidney.

Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The ER pathway is similar to the fatty acid synthesis system. In this multistep process, malonyl-CoA first condenses with acyl-CoA to form a β-keto acyl-CoA with two additional carbons with the release of CO2. The β-keto acyl-CoA then undergoes reduction of the ketone group followed by dehydration to form a 2-enoyl-CoA, which is then reduced by NADH or NADPH to form the longer (+2C) acyl-CoA. Chain elongation and other biotransformation of fatty acids have been shown to occur primarily in the ER (1Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 2Sprecher H. Luthria D.L. Mohammed B.S. Baykousheva S.P. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2471-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial chain elongation system is a reversal of the fatty acid β-oxidation system; thus, acetyl-CoA, instead of malonyl-CoA, is used for the condensation reaction, and the resulting β-keto acyl-CoA undergoes the same series of reactions as described above (3Seubert W. Podack E.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The physiological function of the mitochondrial chain elongation system is not clear (4Cvetanovic M. Moreno de la Garza M. Dommes V. Kunau W.H. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 9-56Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Contradictory findings have been reported regarding the presence of another cellular fatty acid chain elongation system in mammalian peroxisomes. Nagi et al. (5Nagi M.N. Cook L. Ghesquier D. Cinti D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) initially reported the absence of an elongation system in rat liver peroxisomes. However, Horieet al. (6Horie S. Suzuki T. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) later provided good evidence for the presence of an active peroxisomal chain elongation system in rat liver. This peroxisomal system was shown to be similar to the mitochondrial system in that acetyl-CoA is used as the carbon donor for chain elongation. In both, all of the chain elongation reactions are apparently catalyzed by the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway enzymes in the reverse directions except for the last step (i.e. the reduction of the 2-enoyl-CoA). This is because in the β-oxidation pathway the initial oxidation of acyl-CoAs to 2-enoyl-CoAs is an irreversible step catalyzed by either acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (mitochondria) or oxidase (peroxisomes). Therefore, a separate 2-enoyl-CoA reductase is necessary for the reduction of the double bond at C-2 at the last step of elongation. Mitochondria have been shown to contain such a specific 2-enoyl-CoA reductase, which has been purified to homogeneity as a 35.5-kDa protein (4Cvetanovic M. Moreno de la Garza M. Dommes V. Kunau W.H. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 9-56Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This purified enzyme only utilized NADPH as the coenzyme. Horie et al. (6Horie S. Suzuki T. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) provided good evidence for the presence of a similar NADPH-linked enoyl-CoA reductase in rat liver peroxisomes, although the enzyme was not solubilized or purified.During the course of purification of guinea pig liver peroxisomal acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) reductase (7Datta S.C. Ghosh M.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8268-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a contaminating 40-kDa protein was found to be associated with the reductase. This protein was found to bind to the NADPH affinity column along with the acyl-DHAP reductase. We report here that this protein is a 2-enoyl-CoA reductase. From its partial amino acid sequence information, we have cloned the cDNA of this guinea pig liver protein and also the corresponding mouse and human cDNAs. The guinea pig cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein has been found to have high trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase activity with NADPH as the reductant.DISCUSSIONThe induction of the active 2-enoyl-CoA reductase when the cDNAs were expressed in E. coli and the similarity of the properties and specificity of the purified recombinant enzyme with those of the peroxisomal enzyme, but not with the microsomal reductase, show that the cloned cDNAs encode a peroxisomaltrans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase. The presence of the PTS-1 in the protein sequences and Western analysis of its subcellular distribution (Fig. 6) corroborate the peroxisomal location of the reductase. These results also confirm the report by Horie et al. (6Horie S. Suzuki T. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which provided good evidence for the presence of an enoyl-CoA reductase in rat liver peroxisomes. The reaction catalyzed by this reductase is shown below (Scheme 1).R–CH2–3CH=2CH–1C∥O∼SCoA+NADPH+H+SCHEME 1 →R–CH2–3CH2–2CH2–1C∥O∼SCoA+NADP+As indicated above, the putative amino acid sequences of the reductase (Fig. 3) have high homology to a large number of pyridine nucleotide-linked dehydrogenases. These polypeptide sequences seem to belong to the recently described “short chain acyl dehydrogenase/reductase” family (27Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). For example, the N-terminal part of the consensus sequence of the reductase has the same NAD(P)H-binding motif, GXXXGXG, at amino acid residues 25–31 (Fig. 3). Similarly, the YX 3–7K motif shown to be present in the catalytic center of such dehydrogenases is also present in the enoyl-CoA reductase at residues 179–183 (178–182 for the guinea pig enzyme). The amino acid sequences of the enoyl-CoA reductase (Fig. 3) have hydrophobic stretches (e.g. from residue 153 to 162 and from 242 to 251), but none of them meet the criteria for a membrane-spanning α-helical structure. Interestingly, there are two conservedN-glycosylation motifs (NLT) at positions 131 and 180 (179 for the guinea pig) of the amino acid sequences. Although to date no peroxisomal proteins have been shown to beN-glycosylated (28Volkl A. Lazarow P.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 504-505Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), recently Elgersma et al.provided evidence that Pex 15P, an S. cerevisiaeperoxisomal membrane protein, is O-glycosylated (29Elgersma Y. Kwast L. van den Berg M. Snyder W.B. Distel B. Subramani S. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7326-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).Among the mammalian dehydrogenases, the enoyl-CoA reductase has high homology to both mitochondrial (31% identity, 51% similarity) and peroxisomal (31% identity, 49% similarity) 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (30Fransen M. Van Veldhoven P.P. Subramani S. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Geisbrecht B.V. Liang X. Morrell J.C. Schulz H. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25814-25820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The peroxisomal enoyl-CoA reductases also have homology to the bacterial enoyl-ACP reductases that catalyze the same reaction (22% identity and 50% similarity extending throughout the protein sequence of the E. coli enzyme). Surprisingly, the reductase sequences (Fig. 3) have only very limited homology to the enoyl reductase domain of the multifunctional mammalian fatty acid synthase (32Witkowski A. Rangan V.S. Randhawa Z.I. Amy C.M. Smith S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Chirala S.S. Huang W.Y. Jayakumar A. Sakai K. Wakil SJ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5588-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This indicates that the enoyl reductases described here belong to a new family of enzymes and may have counterparts in the ER and mitochondria of mammalian cells. Therefore, the availability of these cDNA clones will aid in the discovery of other cellular isoenzymes, and the active recombinant enzyme will facilitate studies into the structure of the enzyme and the molecular details of the catalytic mechanism for the reduction of the double bond.As discussed above, one rat cDNA recently submitted to GenBankTM (AF021854 and AF099742) from two different laboratories has very high homology to the cloned cDNAs reported here, indicating that it is most probably the rat counterpart of peroxisomal enoyl-CoA reductase. Although AF021854 was tentatively designated as coding for 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, we did not find any such activity in the recombinant guinea pig enzyme. While this manuscript was in preparation, the details of cloning of the AF099742were described by Zhang and Underwood (34Zhang J. Underwood L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These authors isolated the clone from fasted rat liver cDNA library prepared by “suppression subtractive hybridization.” Although the enzyme it coded was not identified, they also pointed out the homology of the sequence to short chain acyl dehydrogenase/reductase family and the presence of PTS-1 in the putative polypeptide. Consistent with our results, transcript levels were found to be highest in rat liver and kidney, and it has been also shown that the liver transcript level is increased when the rats are fasted for 48 h. Sequence homology, as shown in Fig. 3, strongly suggests that this cDNA encodes the rat peroxisomal 2-enoyl-CoA reductase.Although the partially purified peroxisomal enzyme seemed to be about 40–60% pure, it had a much lower specific activity (75 milliunits/mg of protein by radiometric assay) than the purified recombinant enzyme (600–750 milliunits/mg of protein). This is probably because the enzyme became very labile after the detergent solubilization but a significant fraction of the partially denatured enzyme still was capable of binding to the NADP+ affinity matrix. The purified recombinant enzyme had up to 2.0 units/mg of protein activity by the spectrophotometric assay, which is ∼200 times the specific activity of the liver peroxisomal reductase. The expression of an active recombinant enzyme in E. coli shows that post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation) are not necessary for enzyme activity.The substrate specificity of the enzyme shows that it may be termed a medium chain enoyl-CoA reductase, with specificity similar to that of mitochondrial and microsomal reductases. However, the longer chain enoyl-CoAs (14:1 and 16:1) are also good substrates for both the microsomal and the peroxisomal enzymes (Fig. 7), indicating that this enzyme may have a similar function in both of these organelles. Horieet al. (6Horie S. Suzuki T. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) showed that in peroxisomes, octanoyl-CoA is chain-elongated to form dodecanoyl-CoA, and recently, Hayashi and Sato (35Hayashi H. Sato A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in rat liver peroxisomes dodecanoyl-CoA was chain-elongated to form palmitoyl-CoA, which was reduced to hexadecanol by the NADPH-linked peroxisomal acyl-CoA reductase (36Burdett K. Larkins L.K. Das A.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12201-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results show that fatty acid chain elongation in peroxisomes can be demonstrated in vitro. The physiological importance of the peroxisomal chain elongation system, however, is not clear. Although the specific activity of the peroxisomal enoyl-CoA reductase, the key enzyme for the fatty acid chain elongation system, is similar to that of the ER enzyme, the total activity of cellular ER reductase is much more than the peroxisomal enzyme, because the ER contains about 10 times more protein than peroxisomes per cell (37De Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 20d-55dCrossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that the ER is the main cellular site for chain elongation of fatty acids.There is also a dilemma concerning the peroxisomal and also mitochondrial elongation systems because a highly active fatty acid β-oxidation system is also present in the these organelles. It is not clear how these two opposing metabolic pathways could be regulated without compartmentalization. It is possible that the peroxisomal enoyl-CoA reductase may have some functions other than participating in the fatty acid chain elongation system. For example, this reductase may be involved in the reduction of cis-double bonds at even-numbered carbons of unsaturated fatty acids. It has been shown that in mitochondria these fatty acids are mainly metabolized via their conversion to 2,4-dienoyl-CoA followed by reduction (NADPH) to 3-enoyl-CoA, which is then isomerized to trans-2-enoyl-CoA (38Kunau W.H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). trans-2-Enoyl-CoA is either further metabolized by β-oxidation or is reduced by NADPH-linked 2-enoyl-CoA reductase. The presence of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (38Kunau W.H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and also, as shown here, enoyl-CoA reductase in peroxisomes indicates that a similar conversion of cis-double bonds may occur in peroxisomes. Recent findings show that unsaturated fatty acids having double bond(s) at the odd-numbered carbon atoms are also not oxidized directly in the β-oxidation pathway but are converted to medium chain 2-enoyl-CoAs via a reductive pathway (39Tserng K.Y. Jin S.J. Chen L.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 40Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The key enzyme for such conversion, i.e.Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase, has been shown to be present in both liver mitochondria and peroxisomes (41He X.Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because medium chain acyl-CoAs are not the substrates for peroxisomal β-oxidation, the peroxisomal enoyl-CoA reductase could catalyze the reduction of the medium chain enoyl-CoAs formed via these reductive pathways to the saturated acyl-CoAs, which may then be converted to the carnitine derivatives and exported to mitochondria for oxidation and energy production. This pathway is probably physiologically important for the complete oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in liver, especially when the metabolism is switched from utilizing glucose to utilizing fatty acids in conditions such as starvation or an acute diabetic state (42Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 43Kroetz D.L. Yook P. Costet P. Bianchi P. Pineau T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31581-31589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present report of cloning the enoyl-CoA reductase cDNAs will not only facilitate cloning of the cDNAs of other cellular isoforms of this key enzyme of fatty acid metabolism and study of the structure-function relationship of the enzyme but also will be useful for understanding the mechanism of regulation of fatty acid metabolism in different physiological and pathological conditions. In mammalian cells, the fatty acid chain elongation system has been shown to be present in both endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 and mitochondria (1Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The ER pathway is similar to the fatty acid synthesis system. In this multistep process, malonyl-CoA first condenses with acyl-CoA to form a β-keto acyl-CoA with two additional carbons with the release of CO2. The β-keto acyl-CoA then undergoes reduction of the ketone group followed by dehydration to form a 2-enoyl-CoA, which is then reduced by NADH or NADPH to form the longer (+2C) acyl-CoA. Chain elongation and other biotransformation of fatty acids have been shown to occur primarily in the ER (1Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.N. Suneja S.K. Progr. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 2Sprecher H. Luthria D.L. Mohammed B.S. Baykousheva S.P. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2471-2477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial chain elongation system is a reversal of the fatty acid β-oxidation system; thus, acetyl-CoA, instead of malonyl-CoA, is used for the condensation reaction, and the resulting β-keto acyl-CoA undergoes the same series of reactions as described above (3Seubert W. Podack E.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The physiological function of the mitochondrial chain elongation system is not clear (4Cvetanovic M. Moreno de la Garza M. Dommes V. Kunau W.H. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 9-56Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Contradictory findings have been reported regarding the presence of another cellular fatty acid chain elongation system in mammalian peroxisomes. Nagi et al. (5Nagi M.N. Cook L. Ghesquier D. Cinti D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) initially reported the absence of an elongation system in rat liver peroxisomes. However, Horieet al. (6Horie S. Suzuki T. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) later provided good evidence for the presence of an active peroxisomal chain elongation system in rat liver. This peroxisomal system was shown to be similar to the mitochondrial system in that acetyl-CoA is used as the carbon donor for chain elongation. In both, all of the chain elongation reactions are apparently catalyzed by the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway enzymes in the reverse directions except for the last step (i.e. the reduction of the 2-enoyl-CoA). This is because in the β-oxidation pathway the initial oxidation of acyl-CoAs to 2-enoyl-CoAs is an irreversible step catalyzed by either acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (mitochondria) or oxidase (peroxisomes). Therefore, a separate 2-enoyl-CoA reductase is necessary for the reduction of the double bond at C-2 at the last step of elongation. Mitochondria have been shown to contain such a specific 2-enoyl-CoA reductase, which has been purified to homogeneity as a 35.5-kDa protein (4Cvetanovic M. Moreno de la Garza M. Dommes V. Kunau W.H. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 9-56Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This purified enzyme only utilized NADPH as the coenzyme. Horie et al. (6Horie S. Suzuki T. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) provided good evidence for the presence of a similar NADPH-linked enoyl-CoA reductase in rat liver peroxisomes, although the enzyme was not solubilized or purified. During the course of purification of guinea pig liver peroxisomal acyldihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) reductase (7Datta S.C. Ghosh M.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8268-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a contaminating 40-kDa protein was found to be associated with the reductase. This protein was found to bind to the NADPH affinity column along with the acyl-DHAP reductase. We report here that this protein is a 2-enoyl-CoA reductase. From its partial amino acid sequence information, we have cloned the cDNA of this guinea pig liver protein and also the corresponding mouse and human cDNAs. The guinea pig cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein has been found to have high trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase activity with NADPH as the reductant. DISCUSSIONThe induction of the active 2-enoyl-CoA reductase when the cDNAs were expressed in E. coli and the similarity of the properties and specificity of the purified recombinant enzyme with those of the peroxisomal enzyme, but not with the microsomal reductase, show that the cloned cDNAs encode a peroxisomaltrans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase. The presence of the PTS-1 in the protein sequences and Western analysis of its subcellular distribution (Fig. 6) corroborate the peroxisomal location of the reductase. These results also confirm the report by Horie et al. (6Horie S. Suzuki T. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which provided good evidence for the presence of an enoyl-CoA reductase in rat liver peroxisomes. The reaction catalyzed by this reductase is shown below (Scheme 1).R–CH2–3CH=2CH–1C∥O∼SCoA+NADPH+H+SCHEME 1 →R–CH2–3CH2–2CH2–1C∥O∼SCoA+NADP+As indicated above, the putative amino acid sequences of the reductase (Fig. 3) have high homology to a large number of pyridine nucleotide-linked dehydrogenases. These polypeptide sequences seem to belong to the recently described “short chain acyl dehydrogenase/reductase” family (27Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). For example, the N-terminal part of the consensus sequence of the reductase has the same NAD(P)H-binding motif, GXXXGXG, at amino acid residues 25–31 (Fig. 3). Similarly, the YX 3–7K motif shown to be present in the catalytic center of such dehydrogenases is also present in the enoyl-CoA reductase at residues 179–183 (178–182 for the guinea pig enzyme). The amino acid sequences of the enoyl-CoA reductase (Fig. 3) have hydrophobic stretches (e.g. from residue 153 to 162 and from 242 to 251), but none of them meet the criteria for a membrane-spanning α-helical structure. Interestingly, there are two conservedN-glycosylation motifs (NLT) at positions 131 and 180 (179 for the guinea pig) of the amino acid sequences. Although to date no peroxisomal proteins have been shown to beN-glycosylated (28Volkl A. Lazarow P.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 504-505Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), recently Elgersma et al.provided evidence that Pex 15P, an S. cerevisiaeperoxisomal membrane protein, is O-glycosylated (29Elgersma Y. Kwast L. van den Berg M. Snyder W.B. Distel B. Subramani S. Tabak H.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7326-7341Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).Among the mammalian dehydrogenases, the enoyl-CoA reductase has high homology to both mitochondrial (31% identity, 51% similarity) and peroxisomal (31% identity, 49% similarity) 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (30Fransen M. Van Veldhoven P.P. Subramani S. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Geisbrecht B.V. Liang X. Morrell J.C. Schulz H. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25814-25820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The peroxisomal enoyl-CoA reductases also have homology to the bacterial enoyl-ACP reductases that catalyze the same reaction (22% identity and 50% similarity extending throughout the protein sequence of the E. coli enzyme). Surprisingly, the reductase sequences (Fig. 3) have only very limited homology to the enoyl reductase domain of the multifunctional mammalian fatty acid synthase (32Witkowski A. Rangan V.S. Randhawa Z.I. Amy C.M. Smith S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Chirala S.S. Huang W.Y. Jayakumar A. Sakai K. Wakil SJ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The presence of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (38Kunau W.H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and also, as shown here, enoyl-CoA reductase in peroxisomes indicates that a similar conversion of cis-double bonds may occur in peroxisomes. Recent findings show that unsaturated fatty acids having double bond(s) at the odd-numbered carbon atoms are also not oxidized directly in the β-oxidation pathway but are converted to medium chain 2-enoyl-CoAs via a reductive pathway (39Tserng K.Y.

The key enzyme for such conversion, i.e.Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase, has been shown to be present in both liver mitochondria and peroxisomes (41He X.Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H.

The presence of the PTS-1 in the protein sequences and Western analysis of its subcellular distribution (Fig. 6) corroborate the peroxisomal location of the reductase. These results also confirm the report by Horie et al. (6Horie S. Suzuki T. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which provided good evidence for the presence of an enoyl-CoA reductase in rat liver peroxisomes. The reaction catalyzed by this reductase is shown below (Scheme 1).R–CH2–3CH=2CH–1C∥O∼SCoA+NADPH+H+SCHEME 1 →R–CH2–3CH2–2CH2–1C∥O∼SCoA+NADP+As indicated above, the putative amino acid sequences of the reductase (Fig. 3) have high homology to a large number of pyridine nucleotide-linked dehydrogenases. These polypeptide sequences seem to belong to the recently described “short chain acyl dehydrogenase/reductase” family (27Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). For example, the N-terminal part of the consensus sequence of the reductase has the same NAD(P)H-binding motif, GXXXGXG, at amino acid residues 25–31 (Fig. 3). Similarly, the YX 3–7K motif shown to be present in the catalytic center of such dehydrogenases is also present in the enoyl-CoA reductase at residues 179–183 (178–182 for the guinea pig enzyme). The amino acid sequences of the enoyl-CoA reductase (Fig. 3) have hydrophobic stretches (e.g. from residue 153 to 162 and from 242 to 251), but none of them meet the criteria for a membrane-spanning α-helical structure.

Although AF021854 was tentatively designated as coding for 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, we did not find any such activity in the recombinant guinea pig enzyme. While this manuscript was in preparation, the details of cloning of the AF099742were described by Zhang and Underwood (34Zhang J. Underwood L.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These authors isolated the clone from fasted rat liver cDNA library prepared by “suppression subtractive hybridization.” Although the enzyme it coded was not identified, they also pointed out the homology of the sequence to short chain acyl dehydrogenase/reductase family and the presence of PTS-1 in the putative polypeptide. Consistent with our results, transcript levels were found to be highest in rat liver and kidney, and it has been also shown that the liver transcript level is increased when the rats are fasted for 48 h. Sequence homology, as shown in Fig. 3, strongly suggests that this cDNA encodes the rat peroxisomal 2-enoyl-CoA reductase. Although the partially purified peroxisomal enzyme seemed to be about 40–60% pure, it had a much lower specific activity (75 milliunits/mg of protein by radiometric assay) than the purified recombinant enzyme (600–750 milliunits/mg of protein). This is probably because the enzyme became very labile after the detergent solubilization but a significant fraction of the partially denatured enzyme still was capable of binding to the NADP+ affinity matrix. The purified recombinant enzyme had up to 2.0 units/mg of protein activity by the spectrophotometric assay, which is ∼200 times the specific activity of the liver peroxisomal reductase. The expression of an active recombinant enzyme in E. coli shows that post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation) are not necessary for enzyme activity. The substrate specificity of the enzyme shows that it may be termed a medium chain enoyl-CoA reductase, with specificity similar to that of mitochondrial and microsomal reductases. However, the longer chain enoyl-CoAs (14:1 and 16:1) are also good substrates for both the microsomal and the peroxisomal enzymes (Fig. 7), indicating that this enzyme may have a similar function in both of these organelles. Horieet al. (6Horie S. Suzuki T. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) showed that in peroxisomes, octanoyl-CoA is chain-elongated to form dodecanoyl-CoA, and recently, Hayashi and Sato (35Hayashi H. Sato A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in rat liver peroxisomes dodecanoyl-CoA was chain-elongated to form palmitoyl-CoA, which was reduced to hexadecanol by the NADPH-linked peroxisomal acyl-CoA reductase (36Burdett K. Larkins L.K. Das A.K. Hajra A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12201-12206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results show that fatty acid chain elongation in peroxisomes can be demonstrated in vitro. The physiological importance of the peroxisomal chain elongation system, however, is not clear. Although the specific activity of the peroxisomal enoyl-CoA reductase, the key enzyme for the fatty acid chain elongation system, is similar to that of the ER enzyme, the total activity of cellular ER reductase is much more than the peroxisomal enzyme, because the ER contains about 10 times more protein than peroxisomes per cell (37De Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 50: 20d-55dCrossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that the ER is the main cellular site for chain elongation of fatty acids. There is also a dilemma concerning the peroxisomal and also mitochondrial elongation systems because a highly active fatty acid β-oxidation system is also present in the these organelles. It is not clear how these two opposing metabolic pathways could be regulated without compartmentalization. It is possible that the peroxisomal enoyl-CoA reductase may have some functions other than participating in the fatty acid chain elongation system. For example, this reductase may be involved in the reduction of cis-double bonds at even-numbered carbons of unsaturated fatty acids. It has been shown that in mitochondria these fatty acids are mainly metabolized via their conversion to 2,4-dienoyl-CoA followed by reduction (NADPH) to 3-enoyl-CoA, which is then isomerized to trans-2-enoyl-CoA (38Kunau W.H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). trans-2-Enoyl-CoA is either further metabolized by β-oxidation or is reduced by NADPH-linked 2-enoyl-CoA reductase. The presence of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (38Kunau W.H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Progr. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and also, as shown here, enoyl-CoA reductase in peroxisomes indicates that a similar conversion of cis-double bonds may occur in peroxisomes. Recent findings show that unsaturated fatty acids having double bond(s) at the odd-numbered carbon atoms are also not oxidized directly in the β-oxidation pathway but are converted to medium chain 2-enoyl-CoAs via a reductive pathway (39Tserng K.Y. Jin S.J. Chen L.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 40Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The key enzyme for such conversion, i.e.Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase, has been shown to be present in both liver mitochondria and peroxisomes (41He X.Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because medium chain acyl-CoAs are not the substrates for peroxisomal β-oxidation, the peroxisomal enoyl-CoA reductase could catalyze the reduction of the medium chain enoyl-CoAs formed via these reductive pathways to the saturated acyl-CoAs, which may then be converted to the carnitine derivatives and exported to mitochondria for oxidation and energy production. This pathway is probably physiologically important for the complete oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in liver, especially when the metabolism is switched from utilizing glucose to utilizing fatty acids in conditions such as starvation or an acute diabetic state (42Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar, 43Kroetz D.L. Yook P. Costet P. Bianchi P. Pineau T. J.

Therefore, the present report of cloning the enoyl-CoA reductase cDNAs will not only facilitate cloning of the cDNAs of other cellular isoforms of this key enzyme of fatty acid metabolism and study of the structure-function relationship of the enzyme but also will be useful for understanding the mechanism of regulation of fatty acid metabolism in different physiological and pathological conditions. We thank Dr. Shuichi Horie for the generous gift of different 2-enoic acids and Karen Hajra for invaluable assistance and editorial advice in the preparation of the manuscript."

Studies in our and other laboratories indicate that a dramatic increase in TfR levels during erythroid differentiation occurs at the transcriptional level. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the TfR in terms of its promoter activity and DNA-protein binding in murine erythroleukemia cells.

Oncol.-Hematol. 1993; 4: 241-276Google Scholar) is to mediate cellular uptake of iron from a plasma glycoprotein, transferrin. Iron uptake from transferrin involves the binding of transferrin to TfR, internalization of transferrin within an endocytic vesicle by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and the release of iron from the protein by a decrease in the endosomal pH. After iron release from transferrin within endosomes, iron passes through the endosomal membrane via the endosomal Fe2+transporter, Nramp2, also known as the divalent cation transporter (3Fleming M.D. Andrews N.C. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1998; 32: 464-468Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Virtually all the iron taken up by immature erythroid cells appears in heme, whose rate of synthesis is at least one order of magnitude higher than that in the liver, the second most active heme producer in the organism (4Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of mature erythrocytes and some other terminally differentiated cells, TfR are probably expressed on all cells, but their levels vary greatly with immature erythroid cells showing very high densities of TfR. Erythroid heme synthesis, which uses more than 80% of iron leaving plasma, is critically dependent on iron uptake mediated by high levels of TfR in erythroid cells (4Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is not only exemplified by numerous in vitro and in vivomodels demonstrating that up-regulation of TfR levels during erythroid differentiation (5Schmidt J.A. Marshall J. Hayman M.J. Ponka P.

Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Transgenic animals with no functional receptors diein utero, and mice containing only one functional copy of the TfR develop hypochromic microcytic anemia (10Levy J.E. Jin O. Fujiwara Y. Kuo F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Recently, a homologue of TfR, designated as TfR2, has been identified (11Kawabata H. Yang R. Hirama T. Vuong P.T. Kawano S. Gombart A. Koeffler H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20826-20832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Apparently, TfR2 is unable to compensate the loss of the “classical” TfR, which is highly likely indispensable for hemoglobinization. During differentiation of erythroid cells, TfR mRNA and protein levels increase dramatically (4Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chan L.N.L. Gerhardt E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8254-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chan R.Y.Y. Seiser C. Schulman H.M. Kυhn L.C. Ponka P. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In most cell types, TfR mRNA expression can be enhanced by decreased cellular iron by a mechanism involving binding of iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) to the iron-responsive elements (IREs) of the 3′-untranslated region of the TfR, an interaction that stabilizes the receptor mRNA (reviewed in Refs. 4Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 12Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). However, TfR mRNA levels are only slightly affected by changes in iron levels in hemoglobin-synthesizing cells (6Chan L.N.L. Gerhardt E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8254-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and IRP activities remain virtually unchanged during erythroid differentiation (7Chan R.Y.Y. Seiser C. Schulman H.M. Kυhn L.C. Ponka P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that TfR expression is regulated differently in erythroid and nonerythroid cells. In fact, high levels of receptor expression are associated with transcriptional up-regulation of the mRNA levels in almost all erythroid systems examined (6Chan L.N.L. Gerhardt E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8254-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chan R.Y.Y. Seiser C. Schulman H.M. Kυhn L.C. Ponka P. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that developing erythroid cells evolved a transcriptional mechanism that can override the ubiquitous IRE/IRP control of TfR expression. The mechanisms involved in the basal and cell proliferation-dependent transcription of TfR expression have been partially characterized (12Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 13Owen D. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 14Ouyang Q. Bommakanti M. Miskimins W.K.

About 100 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site is required for driving the transcription. Regulatory elements involved include the AP-1/cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE)-like, SP-1/GC-rich sequences, and the recently identified hypoxia-response element (17Lok C.N. Ponka P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24147-24152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 18Tacchini L. Bianchi L. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Cairo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24142-24146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However little is known about the transcriptional mechanism of the receptor expression in developing erythroid cells. The rate of transcription of TfR correlates well with that of erythroid heme synthesis and remains elevated in nonproliferating erythroid cells such as differentiating murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL) (7Chan R.Y.Y. Seiser C. Schulman H.M. Kυhn L.C. Ponka P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and chicken embryonic erythroblasts (6Chan L.N.L. Gerhardt E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8254-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore the transcriptional regulation of TfR in differentiating erythroid cells seems to be distinct from that in proliferating nonerythroid cells. The active transcription of TfR appears to be one of the essential molecular mechanisms required for efficient hemoglobin synthesis in the course of erythroid development. We have analyzed the regulation of TfR promoter activity in MEL cells that can be induced to undergo erythroid differentiation, including the up-regulation of TfR expression. We report here that a promoter region containing a linked Ets-binding site (EBS) and CRE-like motif is critical for the transcriptional activation of TfR expression. These data indicate that the TfR promoter is erythroid active and mediates inducible transcription upon induction of hemoglobinization. The fusion gene construct of the TfR promoter-luciferase reporter was prepared by subcloning a polymerase chain reaction fragment of the human TfR promoter region (−282 to +14) (13Owen D. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) into the pGL2 Basic vector (15Casey J.L., D Jeso B. Rao K.K. Rouault A. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 629-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The deletion construct (−118 to +14) was made by removing aSmaI fragment of the (−282 to +14) plasmid. Mutations of the putative regulatory elements were generated by a unique site elimination mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mutagenesis primers and the sense strands of the oligonucleotides used in EMSAs were as follows.

MEL cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. To induce erythroid differentiation, cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml in medium containing 1.5% Me2SO or 5 mm HMBA for 60 h. The hemoglobin content was checked with benzidine staining. The nuclei were prepared as described previously (7Chan R.Y.Y. Seiser C. Schulman H.M. Kυhn L.C. Ponka P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), except that cells are lysed in hypotonic buffer without Nonidet P-40 (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2). Nuclear run-on reaction mixtures were 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 units of ribonuclease inhibitor, 1 mm each ATP, GTP, and CTP, 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), and 2 × 107 nuclei. The incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min. Following DNase I and proteinase K digestion, the newly synthesized RNA was isolated by the acid-guanidium-isothiocynate-chloroform method. Radiolabeled RNA of 107 trichloroacetic acid precipitable counts were allowed to hybridize with immobilized cDNA probes for TfR, β-globin erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase, and β-actin as described (7Chan R.Y.Y. Seiser C. Schulman H.M. Kυhn L.C. Ponka P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For each transfection, 107 cells were transfected with 20 μg of the reporter plasmid by electroporation (250 V, 960 microfarad) divided into equal aliquots and diluted with complete medium to 105cells/ml. Cells were then allowed to recover for 5 h. Erythroid differentiation was induced by addition of either Me2SO (1.5%) or HMBA (5 mm). After 60 h, the cell extracts were prepared for reporter gene assays. Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfection of 5 μg of SV40-β-galactosidase reporter. The luciferase and β-galactosidase activities in the cell extracts were determined by chemiluminescence assay kits (Promega and Tropix) with a luminometer (Bio-Orbit). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (19Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar), and all samples were diluted to the same protein concentration, which was measured by the Bradford assay. The binding reactions were pre-assembled in a volume of 18 μl with a final concentration of 5 μg of nuclear proteins, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 80 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% Ficoll and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes (20 fmol, 100,000 cpm in 2 μl) were then added, and the incubation was continued at room temperature for 30 min further. For competition or supershift EMSA, 100-fold excess of the cold oligonucleotides or 1 μg of antibodies were added during preincubation, and the preincubation was extended to 30 min before radiolabeled probe was added. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved by nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 300 V for 3 h in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. The oligonucleotides harboring the consensus regulatory sequence were obtained from Promega or Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against CREB/ATF (sc-270 X), c-Jun/AP-1 (sc-44 X), and Ets-1 (sc-112 X, sc-350 X) were from Santa Cruz Biotecnology. Nuclear run-on assays were employed to detect the amounts of initiated TfR transcripts in uninduced and Me2SO-induced MEL cells. MEL cells were induced to differentiate into hemoglobin-synthesizing cells in the presence of 1.5% Me2SO for 60 h. Control cells were untreated for the same period. Equal amounts of labeled nascent transcripts purified from the nuclei were hybridized with immobilized cDNA probes for TfR, β-globin, erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase, and β-actin. Fig. 1 shows that the rate of transcription of TfR, as well as the erythroid-specific genes, β-globin and erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase, markedly increased in Me2SO-induced cells, whereas that of β-actin increased only slightly. These results indicate that the transcription of TfR is significantly activated upon induction of differentiation. It should be pointed out that after 60 h of incubation, proliferation has already stopped in both induced and uninduced cells. Therefore, the activation of TfR transcription in induced cells is associated with the erythroid differentiation program rather than with proliferation status. To identify the regulatory gene elements involved in TfR up-regulation in MEL cells, a fusion gene construct linking the TfR promoter region (−282 to +14) (Fig. 2) and a luciferase reporter gene were prepared and transiently transfected into MEL cells. Luciferase assays were performed with cell extracts from uninduced and induced MEL cells. As shown in Table I, TfR promoter activity was enhanced 6–8-fold in cells induced to differentiate either by Me2SO or HMBA. This stimulation is well correlated with the degree of induction as observed from nuclear run-on assays. As the stimulation of TfR promoter activity can be observed with two structurally unrelated differentiation inducers, which act through different mechanisms (20Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 419-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), this effect is erythroid differentiation-dependent rather than being caused by nonspecific perturbation because of these agents. The activities of several viral transcription units including SV40, Rous sarcoma virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, type I were also tested but these did not exhibit any increase in activities upon Me2SO induction (Table I). These results indicate that the stimulation of TfR promoter activity is likely a specific event during Me2SO-induced differentiation. We have also transfected the TfR promoter into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and no induction of promoter activity was observed when Me2SO was added (data not shown), suggesting that the stimulation of TfR promoter activity in differentiating MEL cells is an erythroid-specific event.Table IStimulation of TfR promoter activity upon induction of differentiation of MEL cellsMe2SOHMBATR [−282]7.0 (1.5)6.8 (1.2)SV-401.0 (0.2)1.1 (0.2)Rous sarcoma virus1.5 (0.2)N.D.Human immunodeficiency virus1.3 (0.3)N.D.A reporter gene construct, TR [−282], containing the TfR promoter region (−282 to +14) (13Owen D.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) linked to a promoterless luciferase gene was transiently transfected into MEL cells, which were then induced to differentiate into hemoglobin-synthesizing cells by the indicated agents for 60 h. Luciferase activities of the cell extracts were measured. Activities of various viral promoter were also tested for comparison. The data represent mean fold induction of luciferase activities relative to untreated cells of at least three independent transfections. S.E. are in parentheses. N.D., not determined. Several deletions and mutations were introduced into the TfR promoter to identify the regulatory elements involved in the transcriptional activation in induced MEL cells (Figs. 2 and3). Deletion from −282 to −119 did not appreciably affect TfR promoter activity (Fig. 3). In the region from −118 onwards, there are several putative regulatory elements (Figs. 2and 3). A sequence AGGAA matches perfectly with the consensus EBS (21Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Adjacent to the EBS is a sequence TGACGCA that is similar to both AP-1 (TGACTCA) and CRE (TGACGTCA) (22Lee K.A. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, a long GC stretch, which contains a consensus SP-1 sequence, is located between the AP-1/CRE-like site and the TATA box. Elimination of the EBS (TR [EBSm]) significantly inhibited the inducible promoter activity (Fig. 3). Likewise, mutation of the AP-1/CRE site (TR [CREm]) or simultaneous disruption of both EBS and AP-1/CRE site (TR [EBS CREm]) abolished almost all inducible promoter activity (Fig.3). As retaining either the EBS or the AP-1/CRE-like sequence is not sufficient to confer the normal inducible promoter activity, it seems that both EBS and AP-1/CRE site may cooperate in the stimulation of TfR promoter activity in MEL cells. Alternatively, because simultaneous mutation of the EBS and AP-1/CRE sequences leaves the GC-rich/SP-1 sequence intact, this also indicates that the GC-rich/SP-1 sequence alone is not sufficient to mediate the inducible transcription. In fact, extensive disruption of the GC-rich/SP-1 sequence (TR [GCm]) adjacent to the CRE-like sequence did not appreciably affect the inducibility of promoter activity (Fig. 3). In parallel with the reporter gene assays, EMSA was performed to identify the potential DNA-binding factors that interact with the critical elements. Using an oligonucleotide harboring the TfR promoter sequence (TR [−87 to −56], which contains the EBS, AP-1/CRE-like element, and part of the GC stretch) as the probe, at least five major DNA-binding factors (A–E) were identified in uninduced and induced MEL nuclear extracts (Fig.4). Several reproducible changes in the pattern of the DNA-protein complexes were observed. 1) A distinct complex C was more apparent in the nuclear extracts prepared from induced cells. 2) A decrease in complex E was observed in nuclear extracts obtained from induced cells. 3) Careful resolution of these complexes revealed that complex B in nuclear extracts prepared from induced cells had a faster mobility than that from uninduced cells. Importantly, these patterns are reproducible using two differentiation inducers, Me2SO and HMBA. To characterize the DNA-binding factors at the TfR promoter region, a panel of oligonucleotides harboring consensus recognition sequence for transcription factors was used for competition EMSA (Fig.5, A and B). These oligonucleotides were capable of binding to putative transcription factors that regulate the TfR promoter (Fig. 5 B). Stimulation of binding activity of the erythroid-specific transcription factor, NF-E2 (23Andrews N.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), in induced cells serves as a marker of induction of differentiation (Fig. 5 B). The pattern of DNA-protein complexes identified using the TfR promoter oligonucleotide probe (Figs. 4 and 5 A) was very similar to that using the consensus CRE oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 B). In fact, formation of the majority of DNA-protein complexes (A–E) can be effectively prevented by a 100-fold excess of the CRE oligonucleotide (Fig.5 A, lanes 3). However, the same excess concentration of two highly related oligonucleotides, AP-1 and NF-E2, did not appreciably affect the DNA-protein binding (Fig. 5 A,lanes 4 and 5). These results suggest that the AP-1/CRE-like sequence in the TfR promoter behaves more like a CRE in MEL cells in terms of protein binding. Furthermore, the addition of an antibody against the DNA-binding and dimerization domain common to both ATF-1 and CREB-1 resulted in supershifting of most of the DNA-binding factors to the TfR promoter oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, an anti-AP-1 (Jun) antibody has no effect on the DNA-protein complexes. These results indicate that ATF/CREB-like factors, rather than AP-1 (Jun), can bind to the AP-1/CRE-like sequence in the TfR promoter. Previous studies have indicated that in inducible MEL cell clones, the AP-1 (Jun) expression is hardly detected during the course of induced differentiation (24Francastel C. Groisman R. Pfarr C.M. Robert-Lezenes J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar). When excess consensus EBS oligonucleotide was incubated with the binding mixtures, complexes A and E were clearly abolished (Fig.5 A, lanes 2 and 9). Because formation of these complexes can be prevented by both consensus EBS and CRE oligonucleotides, they are likely comprised of both EBS- and CRE-binding factors. Interestingly, a new complex (F) appeared when consensus CRE oligonucleotide was used as a competitor to remove the CRE-binding factors from the binding reaction (Fig. 5 A,lanes 3 and 10). The mobility of complex F was identical to the one that appears when consensus EBS oligonucleotide was used as the probe (Fig. 5 B). The further addition of excess cold consensus EBS oligonucleotide eliminated complex F (Fig.5 A, lane 11), suggesting that this complex is an EBS-binding factor. Therefore, it seems that the EBS-binding factor and CRE-binding factors (ATF/CREB) are capable of binding simultaneously to the bipartite EBS-CRE region (i.e. complexes A and E). To confirm that the mutated constructs employed in the transfection experiments were defective in recognizing the EBS-binding factor and CREB/ATF factors, EMSAs were performed using the corresponding mutated oligonucleotides (Fig. 5 D). Mutation of the EBS of the TfR promoter specifically abolished the formation of complex A (Fig.5 D, lane 2), whereas mutation of the CRE-like site prevented the appearance of all DNA-protein complexes except for a complex with mobility similar to that of complex F (Fig. 5 D,lane 3), the EBS-binding factor as mentioned above. Simultaneous disruption of both EBS and CRE-like sites resulted in the loss of all binding activities (Fig. 5 D, lane 4). Taken together, our results confirmed that the linked EBS and AP-1/CRE-like motif of the TfR promoter is capable of protein binding and is functional in driving the inducible transcription in MEL cells. The TfR is a cell membrane-associated glycoprotein that serves as a gatekeeper in mediating and regulating cellular uptake of iron from transferrin (1Ponka P. Lok C.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1111-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). It is now well established that in proliferating nonerythroid cells, TfR expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by intracellular iron through IREs localized in the 3′-untranslated region of TfR mRNA (reviewed in Refs. 1Ponka P. Lok C.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1111-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 4Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and 12Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). IREs are recognized by IRPs, which when intracellular iron levels are scarce, bind to the IREs of TfR mRNA preventing its degradation. On the other hand, the expansion of the labile iron pool inactivates IRP-1 binding to the IREs (1Ponka P. Lok C.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1111-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 12Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar) and leads to a degradation of IRP-2 via a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (25Guo B., Yu, Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Rouault T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

However, erythroid cells, which are the most avid iron consuming cells, evolved mechanisms that can override the IRE/IRP control of TfR expression (4Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data obtained from several laboratories indicate that during erythroid differentiation TfR is regulated at the transcriptional level (6Chan L.N.L. Gerhardt E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8254-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chan R.Y.Y. Seiser C. Schulman H.M. Kυhn L.C. Ponka P. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and that the IRE/IRP system is probably not involved in receptor up-regulation (6Chan L.N.L. Gerhardt E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8254-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrated that the TfR promoter activity is specifically activated during induced MEL cell differentiation, in agreement with in vitro nuclear transcription studies using run-on assays. Previous studies have pointed to the involvement of a promoter region of ∼100 base pairs in TfR transcription in proliferating nonerythroid cells (12Hentze M.W. Kuhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 13Owen D. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 14Ouyang Q. Bommakanti M. Miskimins W.K.

Here, we demonstrated that the same region can also confer a significant enhancement of promoter activity in nonproliferating, hemoglobin-synthesizing MEL cells. Our study clearly demonstrates that the composite EBS and AP-1/CRE-like region is critical for the induction of TfR promoter activity in differentiating MEL cells. Previous studies have showed that the Ets may be involved in the transcription of TfR. For instance, retroviral expression of Ets-1 was shown to enhance TfR protein expression and stimulate hemoglobinization in K562 and HEL cells (28Clausen P.A. Athanasiou M. Chen Z. Dunn K.J. Zhang Q. Lautenberger J.A. Mavrothalassitis G. Blair D.G. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1997; 11: 1224-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, Sieweke et al. (9Sieweke M.H. Hildegrad T. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) demonstrated that transfection of Ets-1 is able to induce 2–3-fold increase in TfR promoter activity in fibroblasts. Here, our data indicate that the EBS of the TfR promoter is essential for stimulation of transcription in an inducible erythroid cell line. Although we were unable to detect Ets-1 in supershift assays using commercially available Ets-1 antibodies (data not shown), this does not exclude the possibility that the EBS-binding factor identified in our gel shift assays is one of the Ets family of transcription factors that has a function similar to Ets-1 (21Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Most EBS are usually found to be linked with othercis-acting elements, and the Ets family of transcription factors often appears to require cooperation with other factors for their activities (21Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Further to identification of EBS as an essential element for the induced TfR transcription in erythroid cells, our data also pointed to the involvement of an AP-1/CRE-like site, which is just one base pair adjacent to the EBS. Supershift EMSA demonstrated that the AP-1/CRE-like site recognizes CREB/ATF-like factors. Mutation of this site significantly inhibited the erythroid differentiation-induced TfR promoter activity. The binding of the CREB/ATF-like factors to the AP-1/CRE-like site is constitutive in both uninduced and induced MEL cells. However, a shift in the pattern of DNA-protein binding exists following MEL cell induction. Hence, changes in the binding activities of selected CREB/ATF family members or post-transcriptional modification of these factors (22Lee K.A. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) are attributable to the inducible TfR promoter activity. It is possible that these CREB/ATF family members, presumably with different transactivation activities, may compete for the CRE-like site and elicit the resulting promoter activity in a tissue- or stage-specific manner. Previous reports have indicated that the AP-1/CRE-like sequence of the TfR promoter may also be important in cell growth-dependent TfR gene transcription (13Owen D. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 14Ouyang Q. Bommakanti M. Miskimins W.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1796-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Casey J.L., D Jeso B. Rao K.K. Rouault A. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 629-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Lok C.N. Chan K.F.J. Loh T.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The identities of the trans-acting factors on the AP-1/CRE-like sequence are largely unknown, but they appear to be distinct from the CREB/ATF-like factors we have demonstrated in this report. A large number of AP-1/CRE sites of various genes have been identified to mediate gene transcription in cell growth and differentiation (22Lee K.A. Masson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1174: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the AP-1/CRE-like sequence (TGACGCA) of the TfR promoter is the same as a regulatory element of the c-fos promoter termed the fos-AP-1 site (29Velcich A. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6273-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of the isolatedfos-AP-1 site revealed cell type-specific transcriptional properties (29Velcich A. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6273-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the AP-1/CRE-like sequence of the TfR promoter may also possess similar properties in mediating a wide range of transcriptional regulation of TfR in response to cell growth in general, and also during differentiation of some cell types, particularly the developing erythroid cells. Although additional regulatory elements may be present elsewhere in the 5′-region, our study clearly demonstrates that the composite EBS and AP-1/CRE-like region is critical for the induction of TfR promoter activity in differentiating MEL cells. It is likely that apart from its role in the transcriptional regulation of TfR in erythroid cells, the Ets and CREB/ATF factors may also play a role in erythroid differentiation-dependent expression of other genes harboring EBS and/or AP-1/CRE elements. The first identified member of the Ets family of transcription factors was the v-Ets, the causative component for erythroblastosis of avian erythroblastosis virus E26 (21Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The cellular homologue, Ets-1, is able to stimulate erythroid differentiation, presumably by mediating the transcription of the heme synthesis enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (9Sieweke M.H. Hildegrad T. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 (30Seth A. Robinson L. Thompson D.M. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1783-1790PubMed Google Scholar), and TfR (this report and Ref. 9Sieweke M.H. Hildegrad T. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some studies have implicated the possible participation of AP-1/CRE sites in erythroid differentiation-dependent gene expression. For example, AP-1-like elements, including the NF-E2 binding sites, have been identified in enhancers of various globin genes (31Ney P.A. Sorrentino B.P. McDonagh K.T. Nienhuis A.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 32Iler N. Goodwin A.J. Mclnerney J. Nemeth M.J. Pomerantz O. Layon M.E. Lowery C.H . Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 1999; 25: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Moreover, the promoter of the adult form of the transcription factor NF-E2, which controls the expression of a number of erythroid genes such as globin and porphobilinogen deaminase, has been shown to contain a putative CRE (33Pischedda C. Cocco S. Melis A. Marini M.G. Kan Y.W. Cao A. Moi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ferritin-H subunit gene transcription is enhanced during erythroid differentiation of MEL cells, and this is mediated at least in part by an AP-1-like sequence (34Beaumont C. Seyhan A. Yachou A.K. Grandchamp B. Jones R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20281-20288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may be recognized by the abundant CREB/ATF factors in MEL cells. The up-regulation of TfR in hemoglobin-synthesizing cells via a specific transcriptional mechanism may reflect a tight coordination between expression of TfR and most erythroid-specific genes, which are transcriptionally regulated during erythroid differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2069784708,"Abstract The enzymes 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid-8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS) and 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) catalyze analogous condensation reactions between phosphoenolpyruvate and d-arabinose 5-phosphate ord-erythrose 4-phosphate, respectively. While several similarities exist between the two enzymatic reactions, classic studies on the Escherichia coli enzymes have established that DAHPS is a metalloenzyme, whereas KDO8PS has no metal requirement. Here, we demonstrate that KDO8PS from Aquifex aeolicus, representing only the second member of the KDO8PS family to be characterized in detail, is a metalloenzyme. The recombinant KDO8PS, as isolated, displays an absorption band at 505 nm and contains approximately 0.4 and 0.2–0.3 eq of zinc and iron, respectively, per enzyme subunit. EDTA inactivates the enzyme in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and eliminates the absorption at 505 nm. The addition of Cu2+ to KDO8PS produces an intense absorption at 375 nm, while neither Co2+ nor Ni2+ produce such an effect. The EDTA-treated enzyme is reactivated by a wide range of divalent metal ions including Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ and is reversibly inhibited by higher concentrations (>1 mm) of certain metals. Analysis of several metal forms of the enzyme by plasma mass spectrometry suggests that the enzyme preferentially binds one, two, or four metal ions per tetramer. These observations strongly suggest that A. aeolicus KDO8PS is a metalloenzyme in vivo and point to a previously unrecognized relationship between the KDO8PS and DAHPS families."

Ran plays a central role in nuclear import and export pathways by promoting assembly and disassembly reactions of transport receptors and cargo. Proteins destined for the nucleus contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS), whereas proteins destined for the cytoplasm contain a nuclear export signal (NES). These transport signals are recognized by members of the importin/karyopherin superfamily of transport receptors, which escort NLS or NES cargo proteins through the NPC. Import receptors bind NLS cargo in the cytoplasm, and the import complex translocates to the nucleus, where RanGTP stimulates release of NLS cargo. In contrast, export receptors bind NES cargo in the nucleus together with RanGTP. Translocation of the receptor-NES cargo-RanGTP export complex to the cytoplasm is succeeded by GTP hydrolysis, which triggers disassembly of the complex and release of NES cargo. The nucleotide state and subcellular distribution of Ran, both of which are critical for its ability to coordinate transport, are controlled by regulatory proteins (6Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Seino H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 551-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The appropriate nucleocytoplasmic distribution of Ran is maintained by a balance between nuclear export of RanGTP, in association with transport receptors, and nuclear import of RanGDP mediated by NTF2 (9Steggerda S.M. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 703-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Gorlich D.

The high concentration of Ran in the nucleus and the mutually exclusive subcellular distribution of RanGAP and RanGEF have led to the hypothesis that a gradient of RanGTP exists across the nuclear envelope (7Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 8Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This gradient is thought to confer compartment identity to the nucleus and the cytoplasm by specifying the Ran-dependent assembly and disassembly of transport complexes in the appropriate subcellular location. Therefore, the high concentration of RanGTP in the nucleus should favor assembly of export complexes and disassembly of import complexes (1Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar, 2Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is analogous to, for example, the compartment identity of the endosome, where a proton-rich environment favors disassembly of receptor-ligand complexes. Although the proteins that modulate the nucleotide state and subcellular distribution of Ran (RanGAP, RanGEF, and NTF2) have provided a basis for understanding Ran function in nuclear transport, the recent identification of the Saccharomyces cerevisiaeprotein Mog1p suggests that the regulation of Ran is more complex. Mog1p was identified as a suppressor of certain temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles of Ran and was shown to bind specifically to RanGTP (23Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Analysis of a Δmog1 strain demonstrated that Mog1p is required for nuclear protein import in vivo. Mog1 displays a genetic interaction with the Ran import receptor, NTF2, based on the suppression of ts growth of a Δmog1 strain by overexpression of NTF2 (23Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although the function of Mog1p in nuclear transport is unknown, the multiple genetic and biochemical interactions between Mog1, NTF2, and Ran suggest that Mog1 may regulate the subcellular distribution or GTPase cycle of Ran. Here, we report the identification and biochemical characterization of the murine orthologue of Mog1. Murine Mog1 has a calculated molecular mass of 20,414 Da and, like its yeast orthologue, localizes to the nucleus and binds directly to RanGTP. We found that Mog1 binding to Ran stimulates release of GTP. This unexpected finding identifies Mog1 as a second guanine nucleotide release factor for Ran in the cell. Release of GTP from Ran and inhibition of the release activity by the RanGTP-binding protein RanBP1 are biochemical properties shared by Mog1 and RanGEF. Unlike RanGEF, however, Mog1 remains bound to nucleotide-free Ran in a complex that prevents nucleotide binding to Ran. Mog1 may provide a mechanism for regulating the concentration of RanGTP in the nucleus. The plasmid encoding murine Mog1 was obtained from the IMAGE consortium (clone I.D. no. 736209) and sequenced using T7 and T3 primers to define the complete open reading frame (ORF). The DNA and protein sequences of murine Mog1 were deposited in GenBankTM (accession no. AF243512). The ORF was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into bacterial and eukaryotic expression vectors. Recombinant Mog1 was expressed as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli with an N-terminal GST (pGEX vector, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or T7 tag (pET vector, Novagen) and purified by glutathione bead or column chromatography, respectively. For expression of Flag-Mog1 in BHK21 cells, the Mog1 ORF was cloned into the plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) modified with an N-terminal Flag epitope tag. Cell culture, transfection, and immunofluorescence microscopy were performed as described (9Steggerda S.M. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 703-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). GST proteins (5 μg) were mixed with glutathione beads (20 μl) and either 300 μg of BHK21 cell lysate or 0.3 μg of [α-32P]GTP-Ran on an end-over-end rotator overnight at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed, and the proteins were eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a Ran monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or by scintillation counting. Recombinant Ran was loaded with radiolabeled or non-radiolabeled guanine nucleotides by incubation with [α-32P]GTP, [γ-32P]GTP, or cold GTP in the presence of 10 mm EDTA for 20 min at 30 °C followed by stabilization with 20 mmMgCl2. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed by gel filtration (PD-10 column, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or spin filtration (Centricon-10, Amicon; for preparation of Ran for FPLC analysis). The nucleotide loading efficiency of Ran was ∼30%. Plate binding assays were performed at 4 °C, essentially as described (9Steggerda S.M. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 703-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Black B.E. Levesque L. Holaska J.M. Wood T.C. Paschal B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8616-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, target proteins (5 μg each) were added to 96-well microtiter plates for 24 h. Approximately 100 ng of target protein was adsorbed to each well, as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Wells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 24 h. To assay binding, 0.45 μg of [α-32P]GTP-Ran (in the absence or presence of 1 μg of GST-RanBP1) or 0.45 μg of unlabeled GTP-Ran (total volume, 100 μl) was added to the wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then washed five times with transport buffer (TB; 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA), and the bound proteins were eluted with SDS. Ran was measured by scintillation counting or by immunoblotting of the eluted proteins. For nucleotide release assays, 0.03 μg of gel-filtered [γ-32P]GTP-Ran (final concentration 125 nm) was incubated with recombinant Mog1 (final concentrations ranged from 0.25 to 2 μm, corresponding to a 2–15-fold molar excess of Mog1 to Ran) in TB dilution buffer (TB containing 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by dilution into 5 ml of TB containing 5 mm MgCl2. The radiolabeled nucleotide that remained bound to Ran (release assay) or that became associated with Ran (exchange assay) was measured by filter binding to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm, Millipore). GST-RanBP1 (wild type or E37K mutant) was used at 25 μg/ml (0.5 μm). For nucleotide exchange assays, 0.03 μg of gel-filtered cold GTP-loaded Ran (final concentration 125 nm) was incubated with 10 mm EDTA, 30 nm GST-RCC1, or T7-Mog1 (0.25, 1, or 2 μm) in TB dilution buffer containing 100 μm[3H]GDP for 10 min or for the indicated times at 30 °C. Chromatography of Mog1 (T7-tagged), GTP-loaded Ran (His-tagged), RanBP1 (untagged), and NTF2 (untagged) was performed as described (25Paschal B.M. Delphin C. Gerace L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7679-7683Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in 2× TB using a Superdex 75 FPLC column and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Elution profiles were examined by immunoblotting using affinity-purified Mog1 polyclonal antibody produced against recombinant Mog1, NTF2 monoclonal antibody 5A3 (9Steggerda S.M. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 703-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), RanBP1 polyclonal antibody (clone M-19, Santa Cruz), and Ran monoclonal antibody (clone 20, Transduction Laboratories). We used the protein sequence of S. cerevisiae Mog1p (GenBankTM accession no. BAA28825) in BLAST searches of GenBank to identify potential homologues in other species. We identified ORFs in mouse and Schizosaccharomyces pombe with expectation values (10−7-10−10) indicating that these proteins are evolutionarily related to S. cerevisiae Mog1p. We determined the complete ORF of murine Mog1 by sequencing EST clone AA270237 and aligned it with the fungal orthologues (Fig. 1 A). The MOG1 genes from S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, and Mus musculus encode proteins of 24, 22, and 20 kDa, respectively, and share 24–29% amino acid identity. Murine Mog1 is 24% identical to S. cerevisiae Mog1p and 29% identical to S. pombe Mog1p, whereas S. pombeMog1p is 28% identical to S. cerevisiae Mog1p. An alignment of the three Mog1 proteins reveals that the S. cerevisiaeprotein contains an N-terminal extension of 29 residues that is not found in the mouse or fission yeast protein (Fig. 1 A). Yeast contain a single MOG1 gene, and Mog1 proteins do not display significant sequence similarity with proteins other than Mog1 orthologues. To determine the cellular distribution of Mog1, we expressed epitope-tagged murine Mog1 protein in BHK21 cells and examined its localization by immunofluorescence microscopy. We found that Mog1 is highly concentrated in the nucleus but is excluded from nucleoli and shows no localization at the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1 B). S. cerevisiae Mog1p has been shown to be a nuclear protein as well (23Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As a first step in our biochemical characterization of murine Mog1, we expressed and purified a recombinant version of the protein and tested it for Ran binding using GST pull-down assays. S. cerevisiae Mog1 has been shown to bind to RanGTP in vitro (23Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). GST-Mog1 and GST were immobilized on glutathione beads and incubated with whole cell lysate from BHK21 cells. The bound fractions were examined by immunoblotting using anti-Ran antibody. GST-Mog1, but not GST, precipitated Ran from cell lysate, implying that Mog1 is a Ran-binding protein. To determine whether the Mog1-Ran interaction reflects direct binding, we performed the GST pull-down assay using recombinant Ran in place of cell lysate. Ran was preloaded with radiolabeled GTP to quantitate the interaction, and a GST fusion of the RanGTP-binding protein RanBP1 was included as a positive control. RanGTP binding to GST-Mog1 was similar to the level of binding to GST alone (Fig.2 B), whereas 3.7-fold more RanGTP bound to GST-RanBP1 than GST. One interpretation of these results is that Mog1 binding to Ran requires the presence of a factor present in cell lysate. We found, however, that recombinant Ran could bind stably to Mog1 as well as to another Ran-binding protein, RCC1, included as a positive control (Fig. 2 C). As demonstrated below, the apparent discrepancy in Ran binding in these two experiments can be explained by the readout. That is, the Ran binding assay that relies on measuring radiolabeled GTP fails to register a positive interaction because the nucleotide bound to Ran is released into solution by Mog1. The ability of Mog1 to bind to RanGTP was further examined using a mutant form of Ran that binds stably to GTP (Ran Q69L (15Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar)). Mog1 displayed a very low level of binding to Ran Q69L as compared with the control RanGTP-binding protein, RanBP1 (Fig. 2 D). GST and NTF2, the latter of which interacts with the GDP form of Ran, did not bind detectable levels of Ran Q69L. This result indicates that Mog1 and RanBP1 bind to distinct domains of Ran. The fact that Mog1 binding is reduced by the Q69L mutation implicates the switch II region of Ran in the Mog1-Ran interaction. Our observation that Ran is recovered in a complex with Mog1 under conditions in which the [α-32P]GTP label is not recovered suggested a protein-protein interaction that alters the guanine nucleotide-bound state of Ran. The possibility that Mog1 functions as a RanGAP was ruled out by thin layer chromatography, which showed no specific conversion of GTP to GDP). 2S. M. Steggerda and B. M. Paschal, unpublished observations. The possibility that Mog1 stimulates GTP release from Ran was examined in a filter binding assay. We found that Mog1 assayed at 10 μg/ml (0.5 μm) could stimulate the release of ∼80% of the radiolabeled GTP from Ran in a 10-min reaction (Fig. 3 A, lower curve). Nucleotide release measured in this assay is specific for GTP, since radiolabel is on the terminal phosphate. The only known protein that can catalyze nucleotide release from RanGTP is RCC1. Because nucleotide release by RCC1 is inhibited by the RanGTP-binding protein RanBP1 (16Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), we used recombinant RanBP1 to assess whether nucleotide release by RCC1 and Mog1 may be mechanistically similar. Indeed, we found that RanBP1 can protect RanGTP from nucleotide release mediated by Mog1 (Fig. 3 A, upper curve). Moreover, we determined that a RanBP1 mutant (E37K) that binds Ran with reduced affinity (26Plafker K. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3510-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) also has a reduced capacity to protect Ran from Mog1-stimulated nucleotide release (Fig. 3 A, middle curve). The basis of RanBP1-mediated protection of RanGTP from Mog1-stimulated nucleotide release could be explained by competition between Mog1 and RanBP1 for a common binding site on Ran. Alternatively, RanBP1 could stabilize Ran in a conformation that is unfavorable to nucleotide release. To address this question, we performed binding assays in the absence and presence of RanBP1 and measured the capture of RanGTP by Mog1 and control proteins. We found that the addition of RanBP1 to the assays facilitated RanGTP capture by Mog1 (Fig. 3, B and C). In the absence of RanBP1, RanGTP binding to Mog1 was similar to background levels. In contrast, the addition of RanBP1 stimulated RanGTP binding to Mog1. RanBP1 did not affect Ran binding activity of NTF2 or NXT1, proteins that bind the GDP and GTP forms of the GTPase. Note that the Ran binding by NTF2 is likely due to a low level of [32P]GDP-Ran in the preparation. Because RanBP1 facilitates RanGTP capture by Mog1, we infer that the three proteins form a complex in the solid phase binding assay and that Mog1 and RanBP1 bind to different sites on Ran. All known exchange factors for small GTPases stimulate both nucleotide release and nucleotide binding in vitro (27Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 306-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The biochemical similarities of Mog1 and RCC1 involving nucleotide release and protection by RanBP1 prompted us to examine whether Mog1 also can mediate nucleotide exchange on Ran. We loaded Ran with unlabeled GTP, and measured the incorporation (exchange) of radiolabeled GDP as a function of time in a filter binding assay. Nucleotide exchange promoted by EDTA in this assay is linear during the 30 min reaction (Fig. 3 D, upper curve). In contrast, nucleotide exchange was not observed in the presence of Mog1 (Fig. 3 D, lower curve). The addition of an excess of Mog1 (40 μg/ml; 2 μm) failed to stimulate nucleotide exchange under conditions in which RCC1 (2 μg/ml; 0.03 μm) catalyzed the GTP-GDP exchange on Ran (Fig. 3 E). Taken together, our results indicate that GTP release is stimulated by Mog1, but subsequent binding of GDP is inhibited by Mog1. Thus, under the assay conditions described in this study, Mog1 is a guanine nucleotide release factor but not a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. We used gel filtration chromatography to analyze the size and composition of complexes formed by recombinant Mog1, RanGTP, and RanBP1 in solution. The proteins (5 μm each) were incubated for 60 min on ice to allow binding and fractionated by FPLC using a Superdex 75 gel filtration column. The elution positions were determined by immunoblotting and by comparison with protein standards. Mog1 chromatographed alone eluted in a single peak in fraction 24, indicating that the ∼20-kDa protein is a monomer in solution (Fig.4 A). Ran, which is an ∼24-kDa monomer in solution, eluted at a position similar to Mog1 (fractions 23 and 24). Incubation of Mog1 and RanGTP prior to chromatographic separation resulted in the formation of a complex of the two proteins that eluted in fraction 20 (Fig. 4 C). This elution position corresponds to ∼50 kDa, indicating that the stoichiometry of the Mog1-Ran complex is 1:1. We also examined whether Mog1, Ran, and RanBP1 can form a complex in solution. We found that RanBP1 assembles into a complex with Mog1 and Ran that eluted in fractions 18 and 19 (Fig. 4 D). These fractions correspond to a molecular mass of 59–67 kDa, indicating that the stoichiometry of the Mog1-RanGTP-RanBP1 complex is 1:1:1. To examine whether the complex containing Mog1, RanGTP, and RanBP1 may involve a direct interaction between Mog1 and RanBP1, the elution of the latter proteins was analyzed in the absence of Ran. RanBP1 (23 kDa) when chromatographed alone elutes with a peak in fractions 20–21, indicating that it behaves as a dimer. This observation has been reported by other laboratories (16Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The size of the Mog1-RanGTP-RanBP1 complex indicates, however, that only a single RanBP1 is incorporated into the complex. Thus, although RanBP1 behaves as a dimer when chromatographed alone, we find that RanBP1 interacts with Ran and Mog1 as a monomer. We also found that Mog1 and RanBP1 do not directly interact (Fig. 4 E), indicating that RanGTP bridges the complex of these proteins both in solution (Fig. 4D) and in the solid phase binding assay (Fig. 3 C). We extended our chromatographic analysis to include NTF2, which displays a genetic interaction with Mog1. High copy expression of NTF2 can suppress ts growth in a Δmog1 strain (23Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible physical interaction between NTF2 and Mog1in vivo. Mog1, Ran, and NTF2 were combined and analyzed by chromatography. We observed the formation of a Mog1-Ran complex (fractions 19 and 20) and an NTF2-Ran complex (fraction 22) but not the formation of a trimeric complex (Fig. 4 F). The formation of complexes containing RanGTP and Mog1 and RanGDP and NTF2 reflects the presence of both nucleotide forms of Ran in the sample. In summary, our analysis using recombinant proteins reveals the formation of two distinct Mog1 complexes: Mog1 that is stably bound to nucleotide-free Ran and Mog1 that is stably bound to RanGTP and RanBP1. Because Ran plays an essential role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, defining the function and location of its regulatory proteins is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of nuclear import and export. The key regulatory proteins for Ran include RanGAP (also called Rna1p (13Hopper A.K. Traglia H.M. Dunst R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 14Coutavas E.

The cytoplasmic localization of RanGAP, RanBP1, and RanBP2 ensures that Ran in the cytoplasm is predominantly GDP-bound, whereas the nuclear localization of RanGEF ensures that Ran in the nucleus is predominantly GTP-bound. Our identification of a release factor for RanGTP indicates, however, that the GTPase cycle involves an additional regulatory protein, Mog1. Our results have demonstrated that murine Mog1 is a guanine nucleotide release factor that is highly concentrated in the nucleus. Mog1 binds specifically to RanGTP, an interaction that results in release of GTP and formation of a stable complex with the nucleotide-free form of Ran. Surprisingly, the Mog1-Ran complex fails to bind GDP, suggesting that the heterodimer of these proteins constrains Ran in a conformation highly unfavorable for rebinding nucleotide. The present data indicate, therefore, that Mog1 is a nucleotide release factor but not a nucleotide exchange factor. To our knowledge, Mog1 is the first example of a GTPase regulatory protein with these properties. We also note that the specificity for binding RanGTP and the stabilization of the nucleotide-free form of Ran are features that distinguish Mog1 from RanGEF, the factor that catalyzes nucleotide exchange on Ran in the nucleus. Mog1 was discovered by the Nishimoto laboratory (23Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as a suppressor of ts alleles of Gsp1p, the S. cerevisiae orthologue of Ran. The Δmog1 strain is ts for growth and shows defects in nuclear protein import, with no obvious defect in poly(A)+ RNA export. S. cerevisiae Mog1p was found to bind specifically to RanGTP, however, the nucleotide release activity was not detected because the interaction was measured by protein binding. The observation that the nuclear import receptor for Ran (NTF2) can suppress the growth defect of the Δmog1strain suggests that Mog1 could be linked to regulating nuclear levels of Ran. Thus, NTF2 and Mog1 may provide alternative mechanisms for increasing the concentration of RanGDP in the nucleus that involve nuclear import and nucleotide release, respectively. A Mog1-based mechanism for generating nuclear RanGDP would probably require an additional activity to facilitate nucleotide loading. RanGEF could fulfill this role; however, the ability of RanGEF to catalyze both GDP and GTP loading onto Ran in vitro (11Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 12Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10830-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and the higher relative level of GTP to GDP in the cell makes this unlikely. We speculate that despite the lack of sequence relatedness, Mog1 and RanGEF probably bind to a similar surface on Ran. This inference is based on the fact that both Mog1 and RanGEF stimulate nucleotide release from Ran, and both proteins can form a complex with Ran bound to RanBP1 (16Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Smirnova E. Dong W. Ponstingl H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Indeed, RanBP1 protects Ran from nucleotide release induced by Mog1 and RanGEF. The physical basis of this protection almost certainly involves the ability of RanBP1 to stabilize the structure of the switch-I effector loop of Ran (30Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1999; 398: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 31Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R436-R439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The switch-I effector loop in Ran, and in other Ras-like GTPases, displays a major conformational change depending on whether the bound nucleotide is GDP or GTP (30Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1999; 398: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 31Macara I.G. Curr.

We envision that, in the absence of RanBP1, Mog1 binding to Ran induces a structural change that impacts on the conformation of the switch-I effector loop, which alters the P-loop and destabilizes nucleotide binding. We note that the exchange factor Sos induces a major conformational change in the switch-I region of Ras as part of the mechanism of nucleotide release (34Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Does the ternary complex of Mog1, RanGTP, and RanBP1 identified in this study play a role in nuclear transport? RanBP1 and Ran both shuttle through the nucleus in vivo (22Smith A. Brownawell A. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Plafker K. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3510-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), indicating that the three proteins could, in principle, form a complex in the nucleus. Because of the presence of a functional NES on RanBP1, the ternary complex would then be exported rapidly to the cytoplasm. In this manner, Mog1 could negatively regulate the concentration of RanGTP in the nucleus by an export-based mechanism. Further analysis of Mog1 should provide additional information about how the nucleotide cycle of Ran is coupled to nuclear transport and provide new insights into the regulation of small GTPases in general.

The cut domain is required for DNA binding. The homeodomain is required either for DNA binding or for transcriptional stimulation, depending on the target gene. Transcriptional stimulation by the homeodomain involves the F48M50 dyad. We investigate here how HNF-6 stimulates transcription. We identify transcriptionally active domains of HNF-6 that are conserved among members of the ONECUT class and show that the cut domain of HNF-6 participates to DNA binding and, via a LXXLL motif, to transcriptional stimulation. We also demonstrate that, on a target gene to which HNF-6 binds without requirement for the homeodomain, transcriptional stimulation involves an interaction of HNF-6 with the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP). This interaction depends both on the LXXLL motif of the cut domain and on the F48M50 dyad of the homeodomain. On a target gene for which the homeodomain is required for DNA binding, but not for transcriptional stimulation, HNF-6 interacts with the coactivator p300/CBP-associated factor but not with CBP. These data show that a transcription factor can act via different, sequence-specific, mechanisms that combine distinct modes of DNA binding with the use of different coactivators.

A number of other genes expressed in the liver contain HNF-6 binding sites, but their actual control by HNF-6 has yet to be demonstrated (16.Samadani U. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6273-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). HNF-6 is also a mediator of growth hormone action (18.Lahuna O. Fernandez L. Karlsson H. Maiter D. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G.

During embryonic life, HNF-6 is expressed starting at the onset of pancreas development (19.Landry C. Clotman F. Hioki T. Oda H. Picard J.J. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21.Rausa F. Samadani U. Ye H. Lim L. Fletcher C.F. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Costa R.H. Dev.

Durviaux S.M. Jensen J. Godfraind C. Gradwohl G. Guillemot F. Madsen O.D. Carmeliet P. Dewerchin M. Collen D. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4445-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The ONECUT proteins contain a bipartite DNA-binding domain composed of a single cut domain and a divergent homeodomain. Homeodomains are 60 residues long and are organized into three α-helices. Within the DNA recognition helix, amino acid 48 of the homeodomain is part of the hydrophobic core, and amino acid 50 is essential for sequence-specific DNA binding (23.Laughon A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11357-11367Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 24.Ades S.E. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9187-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the ONECUT proteins, residue 48 is a phenylalanine, not a tryptophan as in all of the other homeoproteins; residue 50 is a methionine, an amino acid never found at this position in the other homeodomains. The F48M50 dyad is therefore characteristic of the homeodomain of ONECUT proteins. Our studies on the DNA binding properties of HNF-6 (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) showed that the cut domain is required for binding to all HNF-6 sites, while the homeodomain is required for binding to only a subset of sites. Mutation of the F48M50 dyad into tryptophan and histidine (W48H50), which converts the divergent homeodomain into a classical homeodomain, does not affect DNA binding. However, this mutation reduces the transcriptional stimulation of those target genes to which HNF-6 binds without requirement for the homeodomain. These observations indicate that the homeodomain of HNF-6 has a dual role; it is involved either in DNA binding or in transcriptional stimulation, depending on the target gene. Based on sequence alignments of their cut domains and of their homeodomains, the ONECUT proteins, which have been found in mammals and in Caenorhabditis elegans, appear as a separate class of cut homeoproteins (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A further comparison of their amino acid sequence (15.Jacquemin P. Lannoy V.J. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2665-2671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of conserved regions outside the cut domain and the homeodomain, namely a serine/threonine/proline-rich region, which we call the STP box, and a C-terminal serine-rich region. In addition, the two known mammalian ONECUT proteins, HNF-6 and OC-2, contain a polyhistidine tract located downstream of the STP box. How the HNF-6 homeodomain stimulates transcription and how the HNF-6 regions conserved among the ONECUT proteins are involved in transcriptional control is unknown. We characterize here the function of the STP box, of the C-terminal serine-rich region and of the polyhistidine tract of HNF-6. Moreover, we show that HNF-6 recruits either the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) or p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), depending on the type of target sequence bound by HNF-6. The interaction of CBP with HNF-6 involves the F48M50 dyad of the homeodomain and an LXXLL motif in the cut domain. Taken together, our data identify two target-specific modes of action of HNF-6 in transcriptional stimulation. pECE-HNF6α and pECE-HNF6αF48W+M50H have been described (13.Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M.

After 4 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and further incubated for 45 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium plus 10% fetal calf serum before measuring luciferase activities with the Dual-Luciferase kit and TD-20/20 Luminometer of Promega. Luciferase activities were expressed as the ratio of reporter activity (firefly luciferase) to internal control activity (Renilla luciferase). COS-7 cells (3 × 105 cells/6-cm dish) were transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum by lipofection usingN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N, N,N-triethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 5 μg of expression vector. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of 40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in 60 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 500 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet-P40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. After three freeze-thaw cycles, the lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected. COS-7 cells lysates (5 μl) were incubated on ice for 20 min in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEGTA, 50 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 4 μg of poly(dI-dC), and the 32P-labeled probe (30,000 cpm). The samples were loaded on a 7% acrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio was 29:1) in 0.25× TBE buffer and electrophoresed at 200 V. The double-stranded oligonucleotide probes used in EMSA were as follows (the HNF-6 binding site is underlined): HNF-3β, 5′-AGCTTAAGGCCCGATATTGATTTTTTTTTCTCC-3′ (−150 to −118 of the rat hnf-3β gene promoter); TTR, 5′-GTCTGCTAAGTCAATAATCAGAAT- 3′ (−110 to −87 of the mouse transthyretin gene promoter). Full-length HNF-6α and the CBP fragments (1–1098, 1098–1620, 1620–1897, and 1897–2441) were produced in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins by the addition of 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside either at 30 °C for 3 h (HNF-6α) or at room temperature overnight (CBP fragments). The bacteria were lysed with a French press in a solution containing 50 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (w/v) aprotinin, 10 mmdithiothreitol (pH 7.4) and cleared by centrifugation at 9000 ×g for 10 min. Cleared lysates were incubated at 4 °C on a rocking platform for 2 h with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 14C-Labeled full-length recombinant HNF-6α, HNF-6αL350A, HNF-6αF48W+M50H, and p/CAF were synthesized in vitro by using the corresponding pSP72 vectors with the TNT-coupled wheat germ extract (Promega). They were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with the immobilized GST fusion proteins in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl (or 100 mm KCl in Fig. 3 C), 1 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% (w/v) aprotinin. After extensive washing in the same buffer, the beads were boiled, and the eluate was loaded on a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was dried and subjected to autoradiography. The plasmids used for this assay were pSP72-HNF6α (13.Lemaigre F.P. Durviaux S.M. Truong O. Lannoy V.J. Hsuan J.J. Rousseau G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The sequence alignment of the proteins of the ONECUT class, to which HNF-6 belongs, had revealed the presence of three conserved regions outside the cut domain and the homeodomain. These are a 24-residue-long serine/threonine/proline-rich region (STP box) corresponding to amino acids 99–122 of HNF-6, a polyhistidine tract (amino acids 123–138), and a C-terminal serine-rich region (amino acids 449–465) (15.Jacquemin P. Lannoy V.J. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2665-2671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To identify the role of these domains, we constructed expression vectors for HNF-6 mutants devoid of these domains and tested their activity on two different reporter constructs in transfected rat hepatoma FTO-2B cells. One reporter contains the luciferase gene under the control of a TATA box and six copies of the HNF-6 site found in the hnf3β gene. The other reporter is identical, except that the HNF-6 sites are derived from the transthyretin (ttr) gene. These two reporters were chosen because we had found (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that binding of HNF-6 to the HNF-3β-type reporter requires only the cut domain, while binding of HNF-6 to the TTR-type reporter requires both the cut domain and the homeodomain. Moreover, the homeodomain is required for transcriptional stimulation via the HNF-3β site but not via the TTR site (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We first verified by EMSA that the various HNF-6α mutants bound at least as well as wild-type HNF-6α to the HNF-6 binding sites derived from the ttr and hnf3β genes. This was the case (Fig. 1 A). We then tested their transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig. 1 B, deletion of the C-terminal serine-rich domain (HNF-6αΔSer) or of the polyhistidine tract (HNF-6αΔPH) increased slightly the transcriptional activity of HNF-6α on both types of target sequences, suggesting that these regions are inhibitory. In contrast, deletion of the STP box (HNF-6αΔSTP) decreased by about half the activity of HNF-6α on the two reporter constructs, indicating that this box plays an important role in the stimulatory activity of HNF-6 on both types of target sequences. When the deletion of the STP box was combined with the mutation of the F48M50 dyad in the homeodomain (HNF-6αΔSTP + FM), a further decrease in transcriptional activity was observed on the HNF-3β-type reporter, consistent with the role of the F48M50 dyad in transactivation of this reporter (14.Lannoy V.J.

In contrast, HNF-6αΔSTP + FM was not less active than HNF-6αΔSTP on the TTR-type reporter, again consistent with the lack of activation function of the F48M50 dyad on this reporter (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, both the STP box and the homeodomain participate in the stimulatory activity of HNF-6 on the HNF-3β-type reporter. Possible slight differences in the amount of HNF-6 proteins produced are not responsible for these differences in transcriptional activation. Indeed, the transfection experiments were performed under conditions in which the reporter is saturated by HNF-6. These conditions had been optimized in preliminary experiments in which the saturating amounts of HNF-6 were determined by transfecting a constant amount of reporter construct with increasing amounts of HNF-6 expression vectors (data not shown). The cut domain of HNF-6 and of all of the other ONECUT class proteins contains a LSDLL sequence that matches the LXXLL helical motif. This motif has been identified as being involved in transcription factor/coactivator interactions (25.Gu W. Shi X.-L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 26.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether the LSDLL sequence in the cut domain of HNF-6 plays a role in transcriptional activation. To do so, we constructed an expression vector coding for HNF6αL350A in which the LSDLL sequence has been mutated into LSDAL (Fig. 1 B). This mutation abolishes the functionality of the LXXLL motif in terms of interaction with proteins (26.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). The activity of the L350A mutant on the TTR- or HNF-3β-type reporter constructs was tested by transfection in FTO-2B cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, mutation of the LSDLL sequence present in the cut domain reduced the transcriptional activity of HNF-6α on the two reporter plasmids. This effect was more severe on the HNF-3β-type reporter (75% of reduction) than on the TTR-type reporter (50% of reduction). The reduced transcriptional activity of the L350A mutant was not a consequence of decreased DNA binding, as could have been suspected from the known role of the cut domain in binding to the TTR and HNF-3β sites (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Indeed, EMSA showed that HNF-6α and HNF-6αL350A bound equally well to the two probes tested (Fig. 1 C). We conclude that the cut domain of HNF-6 is required not only for DNA binding, but also for transcriptional stimulation via the two types of HNF-6 binding sites, and that it is therefore bifunctional. LXXLL motifs are known to interact with CBP. This protein, which is present in limiting amounts, does not bind DNA but instead acts as a bridge between transcription factors and the transcriptional machinery (25.Gu W. Shi X.-L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 27.Facchinetti V. Loffarelli L. Schreek S. Oelgeschläger M. Lüscher B. Introna M. Golay J. Biochem.

To test the hypothesis that HNF-6 uses CBP as a coactivator, we transfected FTO-2B cells with the HNF-6α or HNF-6αL350A expression vector in the presence of increasing amounts of a CBP expression vector and with the HNF-3β-type reporter construct. Consistent with our hypothesis, CBP increased the activity of wild-type HNF-6α in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). Coactivation by CBP was abolished when transcription of the reporter was stimulated by HNF-6αL350A instead of HNF-6α (Fig. 2 B). This indicated that the LSDLL sequence of HNF-6 is required for coactivation by CBP and suggested that CBP interacts with HNF-6α via this sequence. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed in vitro GST pull-down experiments (Fig.3 A). Bacterially expressed fusion proteins consisting of portions of CBP linked to GST were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and tested for their ability to retain radioactively labeled recombinant HNF-6α. These experiments showed that the N-terminal third (amino acids 1–1098) of CBP specifically interacts with HNF-6α. In contrast, this fragment of CBP did not interact with HNF-6αL350A (Fig. 3 B). These results confirm the cotransfection data described above in which HNF-6α, but not HNF-6αL350A, is coactivated by CBP. We conclude that the LSDLL sequence of the HNF-6 cut domain is required for interacting with CBP. Our earlier experiments (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) had shown that stimulation of the HNF-3β-type reporter by HNF-6 requires an intact F48M50 dyad in the HNF-6 homeodomain. We therefore verified if the F48M50 dyad is involved in coactivation with CBP. This was done by transfecting an HNF-6α mutant in which the F48M50 dyad has been changed to W48H50 (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This not only reduced transcriptional stimulation, consistent with earlier work (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but also abolished coactivation by CBP (Fig. 2 C). These effects of the F48W+M50H mutation were not due to decreased HNF-6 binding to the reporter gene, since we have shown earlier that this mutation does not reduce DNA binding (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the fact that the homeodomain is not involved in HNF-6 binding to the HNF-3β-type reporter (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To test whether the F48M50 dyad is also required for the interaction of HNF-6 with CBP, we repeated the GST pull-down of CBP-(1–1098) with the HNF-6αF48W+M50H mutant. As shown in Fig. 3B, the amount of HNF-6α·CBP complex relative to the input was 5 times less with the F48W+M50H mutant than with wild-type HNF-6α. This indicates that HNF-6αF48W+M50H bound much less well to CBP than wild-type HNF-6α. We conclude that, on an HNF-3β-type of target, CBP is a coactivator of HNF-6 and that coactivation occurs via an interaction of HNF-6 with CBP that involves the LSDLL sequence of the cut domain and the F48M50 dyad of the homeodomain. The mutation of the LSDLL sequence in the HNF-6 cut domain reduced transcriptional stimulation not only of the HNF-3β-type reporter but also of the TTR-type reporter (Fig. 1 B). We therefore verified whether the stimulatory effect of HNF-6 on the TTR target also involves coactivation with CBP. This was not the case. In contrast to the results obtained with the HNF-3β-type reporter, cotransfection of the TTR-type reporter with the CBP expression vector failed to amplify the effect of wild-type HNF-6α (Fig. 2 D). To investigate whether a coactivator other than CBP is involved in the stimulation of the TTR-type reporter by HNF-6, we tested steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1/nuclear receptor coactivator-1), receptor-associated coactivator-3 (RAC-3/p300/CBP cointegrator-associated protein/activator of the thyroid and retinoic acid receptor/amplified in breast cancer 1/TR activator molecule), and p/CAF. FTO-2B cells were cotransfected with the HNF-6α expression vector and an expression vector coding for the coactivator tested. None of these coactivators affected transcription when tested alone (Fig.4 A). In the presence of HNF-6, however, p/CAF doubled the transcriptional stimulation of the TTR-type reporter construct by HNF-6α. The other coactivators tested did not amplify the effect of HNF-6 (Fig. 4 A). We repeated these experiments with the HNF-3β reporter construct. Here, p/CAF did not enhance the transcriptional stimulation mediated by HNF-6α. SRC-1 had no effect, and RAC-3 amplified the effect of HNF-6 only modestly (Fig.4 B). To confirm the interaction between p/CAF and HNF-6α, we performedin vitro GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 3 C). These showed that matrix-immobilized HNF-6α specifically interacts with labeled p/CAF. Our attempts to delineate functionally the domain of HNF-6 that interacts with p/CAF were unsuccessful. Indeed, Fig.1 B shows that the polyserine and polyhistidine tracts are not involved in transcriptional stimulation of a TTR site-driven reporter and are therefore not candidates for interaction with p/CAF. Deletion of the STP box, mutation of the LSDLL sequence in the cut domain, or deletion of amino acids 1–98 did not prevent coactivation with p/CAF (data not shown). Deletion of the cut domain and/or of the homeodomain prevents DNA binding to the TTR target sequence (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This makes it impossible to test functionally on the TTR site the possible interaction of the latter two domains with p/CAF. Finally, deletion of amino acids 139–347 generated a mutant that was not expressed (data not shown). We conclude from this set of experiments that, on a TTR type of target, p/CAF is a coactivator of HNF-6 and interacts with it in an LSDLL-independent way. The data presented here show that HNF-6 displays two modes of transcriptional stimulation, which are determined by the way in which it interacts with DNA, this in turn depending on the sequence of target DNA. On one type of target, whose prototype is the HNF-6 binding sequence present in the hnf3β promoter, DNA binding of HNF-6 only requires its cut domain. In this case, transcriptional stimulation involves the LSDLL sequence of the cut domain and the F48M50 dyad of the homeodomain; HNF-6 interacts with CBP and uses it as a coactivator. On another type of target, whose prototype is the HNF-6 binding sequence present in the ttr gene promoter, DNA binding of HNF-6 requires both the cut domain and the homeodomain. In this case, transcriptional stimulation involves the cut domain but not the homeodomain. On this type of target, HNF-6 does not interact with CBP but rather with p/CAF. Thus, HNF-6 recruits either CBP or p/CAF in a target-specific way. Coactivation of a TTR-type target by p/CAF does not depend on the HNF-6 LSDLL sequence, although the integrity of the latter is required for full activation of such a target. Work by others has provided examples of a single DNA-binding protein recruiting different transcriptional activators, depending on the context. However, none of them uses the same discriminatory mechanism as HNF-6. The T cell factor LEF-1, which contains a high mobility group DNA-binding domain but lacks an activation domain, needs a partner to stimulate transcription. This partner is β-catenin on the c-fos promoter or ALY (ally of LEF-1) on the TCRα enhancer. In contrast to HNF-6, the LEF-1 binding sequence is the same in the two targets, and the mechanism of partner discrimination probably depends on the interaction of LEF-1 with different factors that bind in the vicinity (30.Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). For nuclear hormone receptors, the sequence of the DNA target can be mechanistically discriminatory, as is the case for HNF-6. Here, however, binding of the same receptor to different sequences determines whether the hormonal ligand will trigger transcriptional stimulation via a coactivator or transcriptional inhibition via a corepressor. Another difference with HNF-6 is that nuclear receptors have a single DNA-binding domain, and it is via their homo- or heterodimerization that the sequence-dependent transcriptional specificity is achieved (31.Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). For HNF-6, it is thanks to the combinatorial use of two separate, bifunctional, domains that distinct target sequences impose distinct modes of DNA binding, which, in turn, determine different mechanisms of transcriptional stimulation. The LSDLL sequence in HNF-6 is required for transcriptional stimulation of the two types of target sequences studied here. On the HNF-3β-type target, our data show that the LSDLL sequence is required for the interaction with CBP and that this interaction is involved in transcriptional stimulation. On the TTR-type target, p/CAF interacts with HNF-6, but this does not require the HNF-6 LSDLL sequence. This suggests that, on a TTR-type target, HNF-6 may interact with p/CAF and with an additional coactivator that would bind to the LSDLL sequence. In the present work, we demonstrate that the cut domain of HNF-6 is involved not only in DNA binding but also in transcriptional stimulation. The cut domain occurs in three copies in the homeoproteins of the Cux class, which includes the Drosophila cut protein and its mammalian homologs (14.Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, there is no evidence that the cut domain of these proteins has a function(s) other than DNA binding. One of the three cut domains of the CUX class proteins contains a VSDLL sequence. Such a sequence in the receptor interacting protein-140 retains the ability to bind CBP and is therefore compatible with the LXXLL motif (26.Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). If the CUX class proteins recruit CBP, it is unlikely that they do so by the same mechanism as HNF-6. Indeed, we have shown here that recruitment of CBP by HNF-6 involves not only the cut domain but also the homeodomain and that changing the F48M50 dyad of HNF-6 to the W48H50 dyad of the CUX class proteins prevents coactivation by CBP. This may explain the evolutionary conservation of these critical residues within the ONECUT class. Interestingly, recruitment of p300, a homolog of CBP, by the homeoprotein NK-4 has been reported recently (32.Choi C.Y. Lee Y.M. Kim Y.H. Park T. Jeon B.H. Schulz R.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31543-31552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast to HNF-6, which binds the N-terminal moiety of CBP, NK-4 binds the C-terminal moiety of p300, and this involves mainly the N-terminal portion (activation domain) of NK-4. CBP serves as a docking platform for several nuclear proteins that are end points of transduction cascades triggered by cell surface signaling (33.Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Since CBP is present in rate-limiting amounts in cells, its concomitant recruitment by different transcription factors on the same gene can promote synergistic stimulation of transcription, whereas competitive recruitment on different promoters may lead to antagonistic interactions (34.Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). This may be relevant to the functioning of the liver-specific transcription factors. Indeed, D-binding protein (35.Lamprecht C. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17643-17648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), HNF-4 (36.Yoshida E. Aratani S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9013-9021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and HNF-6 (this paper) interact with CBP and are members of a network of liver-specific transcription factor that is regulated by extracellular signals such as insulin (39.Duncan S.A. Navas M.A. Dufort D. Rossant J. Stoffel M. Science. 1998; 281: 692-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and growth hormone (40.Lahuna O. Rastegar M. Maiter D. Thissen J.-P. Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our identification of HNF-6 as a partner of CBP broadens our understanding of this integrative mechanism. First, this hints at a possible modulation of HNF-6 activity by extracellular signals. Second, insofar as HNF-6 is a tissue-restricted transcription factor that recruits CBP to only a subset of its target genes, our model provides a new mechanism for the tissue-specific and gene-specific transcriptional effects of such signals.

In addition, analysis with the rgpA kgp hagA and rgpA rgpB kgp triple mutants that failed to express HbR on their cell surfaces revealed that HbR was indispensable for P. gingivalis cells to bind hemoglobin (16Shi Y.

Second, it has been found that a peptide named lactoferricin, which is liberated from lactoferrin by degradation with gastric pepsin, has a bactericidal action. This looped peptide of the N-lobe of the exposed surface of a lactoferrin molecule is distinct from the iron binding region (24Bellamy W. Takase M. Yamauchi K. Wakabayashi H. Kawase K. Tomita M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 25Yamauchi K. Tomita M. Giehl T.J. Ellison III, R.T. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 719-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Odell E.W. Sarra R. Foxworthy M. Chapple D.S. Evans R.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The mechanism of bactericidal action of this cationic peptide may be elucidated to be, as in other antimicrobial peptides such as cecropins and magainins, that the peptide interacts with negatively charged divalent cation binding sites on bacterial cell surfaces such as LPS, disrupts these sites, and leads to the uptake of peptides across the outer membrane. The affected membrane forms a channel, resulting in leakage of cytoplasmic molecules and cell death (27Marion D. Zasloff D.M. Bax A. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 28Varra M. Varra T. Antimicrob. Agent Chemother. 1994; 38: 2498-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Third, it has been demonstrated recently that lactoferrin specifically inactivates colonization factors of Hemophilus influenzae and attenuates the pathogenic potential of this bacterium (29Qiu J. Hendrixson D.R. Baker E.N. Murphy T.F. St. Geme III., J.W. Plaut A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12641-12646Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).The concentration of lactoferrin rises to as high as 20 μm in the gingival crevicular fluids of patients with localized juvenile periodontitis, gingivitis, and adult periodontitis (30Friedman S.A. Mandel I.D. Herrera M.S. J. Periodontol. 1983; 54: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Adonogianaki E. Moughal N.A. Kiane D.F. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1993; 20: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). P. gingivalis cells have the ability to adsorb lactoferrin (32Kalfas S. Andersson M. Edwardsson S. Forsgren A. Naidu A.S. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 6: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but it is not yet known what molecule(s) on the cell surface is(are) responsible for this adsorption. In addition, it has not been determined whether P. gingivalis cells utilize iron from lactoferrin or whether lactoferrin attenuates their growth as an antimicrobial agent.In the present study, We found that human lactoferrin bound to HbR and removed it from the cell surface of P. gingivalis and that the lactoferricin region of lactoferrin and the N-terminal anion-rich region of HbR might be responsible for the interaction of lactoferrin with HbR. We also found that lactoferrin could not support the growth of P. gingivalis as an iron source. In contrast, the growth of P. gingivalis was inhibited by lactoferrin when it was grown in a rich medium containing hemoglobin as the sole iron source.DISCUSSIONAlthough P. gingivalis grows well in a medium containing hemin or hemoglobin as an iron source, the concentration of hemoglobin required to support its growth is much lower than that of hemin. The concentrations of hemin and hemoglobin to support 50% of the maximal growth rates are 1–5 μm and 1.7 nm, respectively (37Shizukuishi S. Tazaki K. Inoshita E. Kataoka K. Hanioka T. Amano A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 131: 313-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which implies that the iron uptake/utilization systems from hemin and hemoglobin may have, at least in part, different pathways. In a previous study (11Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we presented a hypothetical mechanism of the iron uptake/utilization from erythrocytes. We showed that P. gingivalis cells may adhere to erythrocytes by the HA domain proteins intragenically encoded by rgpA, kgp and hagA. After this adherence, the RGP and/or KGP proteinases may extensively digest surface proteins of erythrocytes, resulting in the release of hemoglobin. Released hemoglobin may then be captured by the HbR proteins and proteolytically degraded to release heme. The heme may then be stored on the surfaces of P. gingivalis cells and utilized by the bacterium. By genetic analysis, HbR was found to be the major hemoglobin receptor protein in P. gingivalis (16Shi Y. Ratnayake D.B. Okamoto K. Abe N. Yamamoto K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17955-17960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We found that haptoglobin, a natural hemoglobin-binding protein, had the ability to inhibit the interaction of hemoglobin with HbR by forming a haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex, revealed by surface plasmon resonance analysis with an HbR-immobilized chip. It was reported that haptoglobin suppresses the growth of P. gingivalis in a medium containing hemoglobin (37Shizukuishi S. Tazaki K. Inoshita E. Kataoka K. Hanioka T. Amano A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 131: 313-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that HbR may play a crucial role in the acquisition of iron from hemoglobin in a natural niche for P. gingivalis.In this study, we found that lactoferrin, as well as hemoglobin, bound HbR. Lactoferrin is thought to play a pivotal role in the prevention of infection in the host and its ability to sequester iron from potential pathogens has been regarded as an antimicrobial function (23Reiter B. Int. J. Tissue React. 1983; 5: 87-96PubMed Google Scholar). The antimicrobial function of lactoferrin may not simply be because of the removal of free iron ions from the environment but may involve the interaction between lactoferrin and cell surfaces of microorganisms (38Valenti P. Antonini G. Fanelli R. Orsi N. Antonini E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 840-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, lactoferrin effectively bound to the cell surface of P. gingivalis. The results with the various mutants used, except the rgpA kgp mutant, suggest that lactoferrin binding to the cell surface is attributable to the presence of HbR. The rgpA kgp mutant has HbR on the cell surface. However, the reactivity of the mutant cells to anti-HbR antiserum is significantly weaker than that of the wild type (16Shi Y. Ratnayake D.B. Okamoto K. Abe N. Yamamoto K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17955-17960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). No lactoferrin binding of the rgpA kgp mutant may be explained by the possibility that the circumstances around HbR on the cell surface of the mutant are different from those of HbR derived from the rgpA and kgp genes, and this difference changes the accessibility of lactoferrin to HbR because all HbR in the mutant should come from the hagA gene. HbR shares no similarities with the known lactoferrin-binding proteins of prokaryotes such as LbpA and LbpB of Neisseria meningitidis (39Schryvers A.B. Bonnah R., Yu, R. Wong H. Retzer M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 443: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).We also found that lactoferrin suppressed the growth of P. gingivalis in the medium containing hemoglobin as the sole iron source but not in the medium containing hemin. In several Gram-negative bacteria, lactoferrin damages their outer membranes and releases LPS from the cells (40Reiter B. Perraudin J.P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 443: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In P. gingivalis, no significant release of LPS, fimbriae/fimbrillin, or the HA proteins was found after lactoferrin treatment. In addition, the treatment produced no change in the viability of P. gingivalis. In contrast, lactoferrin removed HbR from P. gingivalis cells. Recently, Qiu et al. (29Qiu J. Hendrixson D.R. Baker E.N. Murphy T.F. St. Geme III., J.W. Plaut A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12641-12646Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) found that human milk lactoferrin efficiently extracted IgA1 proteinase preprotein from the cell surface of H. influenzae and degraded Hap adhesin and that PMSF completely suppressed the IgA1 extraction and the Hap degradation. IgA1 proteinase and Hap are produced as large polyproteins comprising four and three domains, respectively (41Poulsen K. Brandt J. Hjorth J.P. Thogersen H.C. Kilian M. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Pohlner J. Halter R. Beyreuther K. Meyer T.F. Nature. 1987; 325: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 43Hendrixson D.R. de la Morena M.L. Stathopoulos C. St. Geme III, J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because the rgpA and kgp gene products were polyproteins consisting of the proteolytic domain proteins (RGP and KGP), HbR, and HA, we investigated whether the potential proteolytic activity of lactoferrin was involved in the release of HbR from the cell surface. The results showed that PMSF did not affect the lactoferrin-mediated HbR release, but interestingly, iodoacetamide and a mixture of leupeptin and TLCK that had the potential to inhibit RGP and KGP proteinases did inhibit the HbR release. HbR makes a complex with proteinase domains and HA domains, and these domains are covalently bound to one another in the early period of growth phase (44DeCarlo A.A. Harber G.J. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 12: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After this period, these domains are separated by RGP and KGP proteinases although the domain proteins remain non-covalently associated (12Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C. Travis J. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 44DeCarlo A.A. Harber G.J. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 12: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 45Bhogal P.S. Slakeski N. Reynolds E.C. Microbiol. 1997; 143: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of the proteinase inhibitors on the lactoferrin-mediated HbR release may be due to the inactivation of RGP and KGP proteinase activity that results in inhibition of processing of the polyproteins. However, this explanation seems unlikely because the HbR released into the supernatant appeared to be directly derived from the 19-kDa HbR already processed from the polyprotein, as judged by the finding that the cell-bound HbR before lactoferrin treatment also migrated at a molecular mass of 19 kDa on SDS-PAGE; after treatment the cell-bound 19-kDa HbR decreased in a concentration-dependent fashion. What interaction between lactoferrin and HbR causes the HbR release? We found that lactoferrin did not bind the truncated HbR in which the first 27 amino acid residues, including 8 anionic residues, were deleted and that the growth retardation and HbR release occurred by treatment of lactoferricin B as well as lactoferrin. These results suggest that the cationic lactoferricin region of lactoferrin may interact with the N-terminal anion-rich region of HbR in an electrostatic action, loosen the non-covalent bond between HbR and other components of the complex, and release HbR from the cell surface (Fig.8). The inhibitory effect of the proteinase inhibitors on the HbR release suggests that a conformational change of the proteinase domain proteins, which can be hindered by the inhibitors, is required in the process of HbR release, although we should reserve the possibility that lactoferrin directly interacts with the proteolytic domain proteins or other components of the complex in addition to HbR. In this context, it is noteworthy that proteinase inhibitors such as TLCK and leupeptin suppress hemagglutination of P. gingivalis cells, which appears to be attributable to the HA proteins of the complex (46Nishikata M. Yoshimura F. Nodasaka Y. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 33: 75-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Curtis M.A. Ramakrishnan M. Slaney J.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 48Pike R.N. Potempa J. McGraw W. Coetzer T.H.T. Travis J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2876-2882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Growth retardation of P. gingivalis by lactoferrin depended on the concentration of lactoferrin. However, after prolonged incubation, P. gingivalis cells grew up to a maximal level even in the medium supplemented with large amounts of lactoferrin, probably because lactoferrin was gradually degraded by proteinases secreted from P. gingivalis and lost its bacteriostatic action. The lactoferrin-mediated growth suppression was not observed in the medium containing hemin instead of hemoglobin. Therefore, the retardation in growth of P. gingivalis may be a consequence of the specific interaction of lactoferrin with HbR, which is the major hemoglobin receptor of the bacterium. These results suggest that lactoferrin may attenuate the infection of P. gingivalis by selectively removing HbR from the cell surface and disrupting the iron acquisition system essential for the in vivo survival of the bacterium and that secreted and cell-bound RGP and KGP proteinases may function as “interceptor missiles” against lactoferrin attack. Pathogenic bacteria have developed various strategies for acquiring iron from their hosts to support their growth, including production of siderophores to chelate iron ions from their environment and presentation of receptors to acquire iron and heme from iron- and heme-containing proteins such as transferrin, lactoferrin, and hemoglobin (1Bagg A. Neilands J.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 509-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 3Schryvers A.B. Stojiljkovic I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Porphyromonas gingivalis is a highly proteolytic Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that is implicated as one of the major causative pathogens for advanced adult periodontitis (4Haffajee A.D. Socransky S.S. Periodontol. 2000. 1994; 5: 78-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Heme is required for its growth (5Gibbons R.J. MacDonald J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1960; 80: 164-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shah H.N. Bonnett R. Mateen B. Williams R.A.D. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Smalley J.W. Silver J. Marsh P.D. Birss A.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). So far it has not been reported that P. gingivalis produces siderophore (8Bramanti T.E. Holt S.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 1146-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); rather, this bacterium elaborates a hemoglobin receptor (HbR)1 for acquisition of iron from hemoglobin (9Fujimura S. Shibata Y. Hirai K. Nakamura T. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1995; 10: 109-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fujimura S. Shibata Y. Hirai K. Nakamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HbR, a 19-kilodalton protein, was intragenically encoded by an arginine-specific cysteine proteinase (Arg-gingipain, RGP)-encoding gene (rgpA), a lysine-specific cysteine proteinase (Lys-gingipain, KGP)-encoding gene (kgp), and a hemagglutinin (HA)-encoding gene (hagA) (11Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Several pieces of evidence show that HbR forms a large proteinase-adhesin complex with RGP, KGP, and HA proteins that are encoded intragenically by these genes (12Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C. Travis J. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Slakeski N. Bhogal P.S. O'Brien-Simpson N.M. Reynolds E.C. Microbiol. 1998; 144: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and appears to be associated with a lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (14Sharp L. Poole S. Reddi K. Fletcher J. Nair S. Wilson M. Curtis M. Henderson B. Tabona P. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3019-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).P. gingivalis has another RGP-encoding gene (rgpB); however, it does not encode HbR or HA (15Nakayama K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 41: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We found in a previous study (11Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that a purified HbR protein has the ability to bind hemoglobin. In addition, analysis with the rgpA kgp hagA and rgpA rgpB kgp triple mutants that failed to express HbR on their cell surfaces revealed that HbR was indispensable for P. gingivalis cells to bind hemoglobin (16Shi Y. Ratnayake D.B. Okamoto K. Abe N. Yamamoto K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17955-17960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that HbR is a major component for the iron acquisition/utilization system from hemoglobin in P. gingivalis. Lactoferrin is an iron-binding, acute-phase protein found in saliva, milk, and other exocrine secretions (17Masson P.L. Heremans J.F. Dive C. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1966; 13: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Lactoferrin is secreted from activated neutrophiles and may mediate the amplification of the inflammatory response, phagocytosis, and regulation of myelopoiesis (18van Snick J.L. Masson P.L. Heremans J.F. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 140: 1068-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19Oseas R. Yang H.H. Baehner R.L. Boxer L.A.

First, lactoferrin has the ability to chelate iron, which results in inhibition of bacterial growth (23Reiter B. Int. J. Tissue React. 1983; 5: 87-96PubMed Google Scholar).

Third, it has been demonstrated recently that lactoferrin specifically inactivates colonization factors of Hemophilus influenzae and attenuates the pathogenic potential of this bacterium (29Qiu J. Hendrixson D.R. Baker E.N. Murphy T.F. St. Geme III., J.W. Plaut A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12641-12646Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The concentration of lactoferrin rises to as high as 20 μm in the gingival crevicular fluids of patients with localized juvenile periodontitis, gingivitis, and adult periodontitis (30Friedman S.A. Mandel I.D. Herrera M.S. J. Periodontol. 1983; 54: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Adonogianaki E. Moughal N.A. Kiane D.F. J. Clin. Periodontol. 1993; 20: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). P. gingivalis cells have the ability to adsorb lactoferrin (32Kalfas S. Andersson M. Edwardsson S. Forsgren A. Naidu A.S. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 6: 350-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but it is not yet known what molecule(s) on the cell surface is(are) responsible for this adsorption. In addition, it has not been determined whether P. gingivalis cells utilize iron from lactoferrin or whether lactoferrin attenuates their growth as an antimicrobial agent. In the present study, We found that human lactoferrin bound to HbR and removed it from the cell surface of P. gingivalis and that the lactoferricin region of lactoferrin and the N-terminal anion-rich region of HbR might be responsible for the interaction of lactoferrin with HbR.

IgA1 proteinase and Hap are produced as large polyproteins comprising four and three domains, respectively (41Poulsen K. Brandt J. Hjorth J.P. Thogersen H.C. Kilian M. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Pohlner J. Halter R. Beyreuther K. Meyer T.F.

Microbiol. 1997; 26: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Because the rgpA and kgp gene products were polyproteins consisting of the proteolytic domain proteins (RGP and KGP), HbR, and HA, we investigated whether the potential proteolytic activity of lactoferrin was involved in the release of HbR from the cell surface. The results showed that PMSF did not affect the lactoferrin-mediated HbR release, but interestingly, iodoacetamide and a mixture of leupeptin and TLCK that had the potential to inhibit RGP and KGP proteinases did inhibit the HbR release. HbR makes a complex with proteinase domains and HA domains, and these domains are covalently bound to one another in the early period of growth phase (44DeCarlo A.A. Harber G.J. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 12: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After this period, these domains are separated by RGP and KGP proteinases although the domain proteins remain non-covalently associated (12Pavloff N. Potempa J. Pike R.N. Prochazka V. Kiefer M.C.

Therefore, the inhibitory effect of the proteinase inhibitors on the lactoferrin-mediated HbR release may be due to the inactivation of RGP and KGP proteinase activity that results in inhibition of processing of the polyproteins. However, this explanation seems unlikely because the HbR released into the supernatant appeared to be directly derived from the 19-kDa HbR already processed from the polyprotein, as judged by the finding that the cell-bound HbR before lactoferrin treatment also migrated at a molecular mass of 19 kDa on SDS-PAGE; after treatment the cell-bound 19-kDa HbR decreased in a concentration-dependent fashion. What interaction between lactoferrin and HbR causes the HbR release? We found that lactoferrin did not bind the truncated HbR in which the first 27 amino acid residues, including 8 anionic residues, were deleted and that the growth retardation and HbR release occurred by treatment of lactoferricin B as well as lactoferrin. These results suggest that the cationic lactoferricin region of lactoferrin may interact with the N-terminal anion-rich region of HbR in an electrostatic action, loosen the non-covalent bond between HbR and other components of the complex, and release HbR from the cell surface (Fig.8). The inhibitory effect of the proteinase inhibitors on the HbR release suggests that a conformational change of the proteinase domain proteins, which can be hindered by the inhibitors, is required in the process of HbR release, although we should reserve the possibility that lactoferrin directly interacts with the proteolytic domain proteins or other components of the complex in addition to HbR. In this context, it is noteworthy that proteinase inhibitors such as TLCK and leupeptin suppress hemagglutination of P. gingivalis cells, which appears to be attributable to the HA proteins of the complex (46Nishikata M. Yoshimura F. Nodasaka Y. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 33: 75-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Curtis M.A. Ramakrishnan M. Slaney J.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 48Pike R.N. Potempa J. McGraw W. Coetzer T.H.T. Travis J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2876-2882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Growth retardation of P. gingivalis by lactoferrin depended on the concentration of lactoferrin. However, after prolonged incubation, P. gingivalis cells grew up to a maximal level even in the medium supplemented with large amounts of lactoferrin, probably because lactoferrin was gradually degraded by proteinases secreted from P. gingivalis and lost its bacteriostatic action. The lactoferrin-mediated growth suppression was not observed in the medium containing hemin instead of hemoglobin. Therefore, the retardation in growth of P. gingivalis may be a consequence of the specific interaction of lactoferrin with HbR, which is the major hemoglobin receptor of the bacterium. These results suggest that lactoferrin may attenuate the infection of P. gingivalis by selectively removing HbR from the cell surface and disrupting the iron acquisition system essential for the in vivo survival of the bacterium and that secreted and cell-bound RGP and KGP proteinases may function as “interceptor missiles” against lactoferrin attack. Although P. gingivalis grows well in a medium containing hemin or hemoglobin as an iron source, the concentration of hemoglobin required to support its growth is much lower than that of hemin. The concentrations of hemin and hemoglobin to support 50% of the maximal growth rates are 1–5 μm and 1.7 nm, respectively (37Shizukuishi S. Tazaki K. Inoshita E. Kataoka K. Hanioka T. Amano A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 131: 313-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which implies that the iron uptake/utilization systems from hemin and hemoglobin may have, at least in part, different pathways. In a previous study (11Nakayama K. Ratnayake D.B. Tsukuba T. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto K. Fujimura S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we presented a hypothetical mechanism of the iron uptake/utilization from erythrocytes. We showed that P. gingivalis cells may adhere to erythrocytes by the HA domain proteins intragenically encoded by rgpA, kgp and hagA. After this adherence, the RGP and/or KGP proteinases may extensively digest surface proteins of erythrocytes, resulting in the release of hemoglobin. Released hemoglobin may then be captured by the HbR proteins and proteolytically degraded to release heme. The heme may then be stored on the surfaces of P. gingivalis cells and utilized by the bacterium. By genetic analysis, HbR was found to be the major hemoglobin receptor protein in P. gingivalis (16Shi Y. Ratnayake D.B. Okamoto K. Abe N. Yamamoto K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17955-17960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We found that haptoglobin, a natural hemoglobin-binding protein, had the ability to inhibit the interaction of hemoglobin with HbR by forming a haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex, revealed by surface plasmon resonance analysis with an HbR-immobilized chip. It was reported that haptoglobin suppresses the growth of P. gingivalis in a medium containing hemoglobin (37Shizukuishi S. Tazaki K. Inoshita E. Kataoka K. Hanioka T. Amano A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 131: 313-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that HbR may play a crucial role in the acquisition of iron from hemoglobin in a natural niche for P. gingivalis. In this study, we found that lactoferrin, as well as hemoglobin, bound HbR. Lactoferrin is thought to play a pivotal role in the prevention of infection in the host and its ability to sequester iron from potential pathogens has been regarded as an antimicrobial function (23Reiter B. Int. J. Tissue React. 1983; 5: 87-96PubMed Google Scholar). The antimicrobial function of lactoferrin may not simply be because of the removal of free iron ions from the environment but may involve the interaction between lactoferrin and cell surfaces of microorganisms (38Valenti P. Antonini G. Fanelli R. Orsi N. Antonini E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 840-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, lactoferrin effectively bound to the cell surface of P. gingivalis. The results with the various mutants used, except the rgpA kgp mutant, suggest that lactoferrin binding to the cell surface is attributable to the presence of HbR. The rgpA kgp mutant has HbR on the cell surface. However, the reactivity of the mutant cells to anti-HbR antiserum is significantly weaker than that of the wild type (16Shi Y. Ratnayake D.B. Okamoto K. Abe N. Yamamoto K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17955-17960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). No lactoferrin binding of the rgpA kgp mutant may be explained by the possibility that the circumstances around HbR on the cell surface of the mutant are different from those of HbR derived from the rgpA and kgp genes, and this difference changes the accessibility of lactoferrin to HbR because all HbR in the mutant should come from the hagA gene. HbR shares no similarities with the known lactoferrin-binding proteins of prokaryotes such as LbpA and LbpB of Neisseria meningitidis (39Schryvers A.B. Bonnah R., Yu, R. Wong H. Retzer M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 443: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We also found that lactoferrin suppressed the growth of P. gingivalis in the medium containing hemoglobin as the sole iron source but not in the medium containing hemin. In several Gram-negative bacteria, lactoferrin damages their outer membranes and releases LPS from the cells (40Reiter B. Perraudin J.P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 443: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In P. gingivalis, no significant release of LPS, fimbriae/fimbrillin, or the HA proteins was found after lactoferrin treatment. In addition, the treatment produced no change in the viability of P. gingivalis. In contrast, lactoferrin removed HbR from P. gingivalis cells. Recently, Qiu et al. (29Qiu J. Hendrixson D.R.

For instance, stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors activates protein kinase A (PKA)1, whereas stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors activates protein kinase C (PKC). Though the end result of these kinases on cellular physiology can be very different, they share at least one membrane substrate, a 72-amino acid peptide with a single transmembrane domain called phospholemman (PLM) (1Palmer C.J.

Several lines of evidence suggest a role for PLM in ion transport and regulation of cell volume. In particular, expression of PLM in Xenopus oocytes leads to the appearance of a hyperpolarization-activated noninactivating Cl current (ICl(PLM)) (2Moorman J.R. Palmer C.J. John III, J.E.

Little is known, however, of other substrates, especially those involving transmembrane ion fluxes and membrane excitability. We have tested the hypothesis that PLM is a substrate for DMPK because 1) PLM is a major substrate for other protein kinases and 2) PLM forms or regulates Cl channels in Xenopus oocytes. To test our hypothesis, we first assessed whether PLM was a substrate for DMPKin vitro. We subsequently measured the amplitudes and biophysical characteristics of Xenopus oocyte-expressed ICl(PLM) in the presence and absence of the mRNA-encoding DMPK.

Full-length recombinant GST-DMPK protein was poorly expressed in a variety of Escherichia coli strains (data not shown), possibly because of toxicity caused by the hydrophobic transmembrane domain. A carboxyl-terminal DMPK deletion clone (GST-ΔtDMPK) lacking amino acids 545–629, including the transmembrane domain, was derived from the full-length construct and could be expressed in TOP10F′ cells (Invitrogen). Cultures of E. colitransformed with GST-ΔtDMPK were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma), grown at 30o for 4 h, and harvested by pelleting. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mNaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm AEBSF, 0.1 mm leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (all from Sigma) and lysed by the addition of 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) for 20 min on ice followed by the addition of 1% TX100 (Pierce, Surfact-Amps X-100) for 10 min on ice. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was incubated overnight with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed four times with cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA. GST-ΔtDMPK was eluted from the beads by the addition of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm glutathione (Sigma), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm AEBSF, 0.1 mmleupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, analyzed on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels, and used directly in kinase assays.

Purified phospholemman was used at 10 μm final concentration (3.4 μg in 40 μl). The PKC substrates used were the glycogen synthase residue 1–8 peptide analog, PLSRTLSVAAKK, referred to as the glycogen synthase peptide, and the epidermal growth factor receptor residues 650–658 peptide, VRKRTLRRL, referred to as the epidermal growth factor receptor peptide (18House C.

Samples were heated to 100 °C for 5 min, cooled, loaded onto precast 10–20% acrylamide Tris-Tricine gels (Bio-Rad), and electrophoresed for 3 h at 75 V. Resolution of substrates on Tris-Tricine gels permits the unambiguous determination of protein phosphorylation as opposed to filter binding assays in which spurious counts can be introduced from autophosphorylated kinases and contaminants. Gels were treated for 30 min with 10% glutaraldehyde (Fisher, reagent grade) to fix the proteins and extensively washed to remove [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, and the loading equivalency was verified by Coomassie Blue staining. Coomassie Blue-stained phosphoproteins were excised from the gels and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Specific phosphorylation activities were calculated after subtracting the background counts found in the substrates incubated in the absence of GST-ΔtDMPK from the total counts found in the presence of GST-ΔtDMPK. Wild-type and mutant PLM and DMPK mRNAs were prepared as described previously (19Durieux M.E. Salafranca M.N. Lynch K.R. Moorman J.R. Am. J.

Briefly, stages IV and V Xenopus oocytes were isolated manually in modified Barth's solution containing penicillin and streptomycin, immediately after excision from the frog. The oocytes were not exposed to collagenase. Injection of RNA (4–8 ng of wild type or phos(−) PLM, and 50 ng of wild type DMPK mRNA, in 100 mm KCl) was accomplished using a graduated, mechanical 10-ml micropipettor (Drummond, Broomall, PA). Within each batch of oocytes, the amounts of wild type and phos(−) mRNA were the same. Injected oocytes were incubated in plastic Petri dishes and continuously rotated in an incubator at 19 °C. The oocytes were defolliculated manually the day of the electrophysiologic experiments, 2–5 days after injection. Whole cell recordings were obtained 1–8 days after injection using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp (oocyte clamp OC-725, Warner Instruments, New Haven, CT) at room temperature as described previously (4Kowdley G.C. Ackerman S.J. John J.E. Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Durieux M.E. Salafranca M.N. Lynch K.R. Moorman J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C896-C900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Current and voltage electrodes were filled with 3m KCl and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.35). The bath solution contained 147 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH); the flow rate was 3–4 ml/min, and the bath chamber volume was 2 ml. Voltage protocols were delivered, and currents were digitized using pCLAMP (Axon Instruments) hardware and software. Oocytes were held at −10 mV. Two-second hyperpolarizing clamp pulses from −40 to −170 mV were applied in 10 mV increments; tail currents were recorded at 40 mV. Current amplitudes were measured as the difference in current levels from the beginning to the end of the hyperpolarizing pulses and were normalized for each batch of oocytes by dividing by the mean current amplitude in oocytes expressing wild type (or phos(−)) PLM alone at a test potential of −170 mV (for the current-voltage relationships) or −150 mV (for the box plots of current amplitudes). Tail current amplitudes were normalized by subtracting the linear component of leak current and then dividing by the tail current amplitude after a hyperpolarizing step to −170 mV. Data were fit using a nonlinear least squares method (NFIT, Island). Statistical tests were performed with SigmaStat (Jandel). The data in Fig. 3 did not pass a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality, and nonparametric statistical tests were employed. Plots were prepared with Origin (Microcal) and SigmaPlot (Jandel). GST-ΔtDMPK phosphorylated PLM (Fig. 1). The specific activity for the phosphorylation of PLM was high at 78 pmol/min/mg. Other substrates phosphorylated by GST-ΔtDMPK included phospholamban, the glycogen synthase peptide, the epidermal growth factor receptor peptide, and myelin basic protein (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows examples of families of ion currents elicited by stepwise hyperpolarization of oocytes isolated from the same frog. Each record shows the effect of hyperpolarization from a holding potential of −10 mV to between −30 and −170 mV for 2 s followed by repolarization to 40 mV. Expression of PLM alone (Fig. 2 A) induced large hyperpolarization-activated currents, which we have previously shown to be carried by Cl and called ICl(PLM) (23Levesque P.C. Hart P.J. Hume J.R. Kenyon J.L. Horowitz B. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The important finding was that co-injection of DMPK mRNA led consistently to a reduction in the amplitude of ICl(PLM) (Fig.2 B). In these oocytes, the endogenous hyperpolarization-activated Cl current, which we have called ICl(endo) (4Kowdley G.C. Ackerman S.J. John J.E. Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), was small (Fig. 2 C), and the injection of DMPK mRNA alone did not affect ICl(endo)amplitude (not shown). The results of a series of these experiments are shown in the first two box plots of Fig. 3. To facilitate comparison of oocytes isolated from different frogs, with different levels of PLM expression, currents have been normalized so that oocytes expressing PLM alone have a current of 1.0. In 122 oocytes (15 batches) co-expressing DMPK, the mean normalized currents were reduced to 0.54 compared with 136 oocytes expressing PLM alone (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney rank sum test). There are four potential phosphorylation sites in PLM, Ser62, Ser63, and Ser68, and Thr69. To determine whether the effect of DMPK mRNA expression required phosphorylation of PLM, we measured the amplitude of Cl currents induced by expression of a mutated PLM molecule in which these phosphorylation sites had been disabled by Ser or Thr mutation to Ala (S62A/S63A/S68A/T69A; phos (-)). We reasoned that any nonspecific effect of DMPK to reduce oocyte translation of heterologous mRNAs would be preserved in these oocytes but that PLM-specific phosphorylation would be prevented. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the mutated phos(−) PLM mRNA induced ICl(PLM) of amplitude equivalent to wild type after the injection of the same amount of mRNA and the same incubation period. The important finding was that the effect of co-injecting DMPK mRNA was lost on the phos(−) mutated PLM (Fig. 2 E). This demonstrates that phosphorylation of PLM is necessary for DMPK to exert an effect on ICl(PLM). As shown in Fig. 3, the results of experiments in 12 batches of oocytes showed the mean normalized phos(−) ICl(PLM) was not significantly changed by co-expression of DMPK (n = 120 and 103; p = not significant, Mann-Whitney rank sum test). The amplitude of ICl(PLM) in oocytes injected with mutated phos(−) mRNA did not differ significantly from control. One mechanism by which phosphorylation might have reduced currents at a given test potential is by altering the voltage sensitivity of channel opening. This has been shown to be the case for neuronal Ca2+ currents in the presence of adrenergic agents, where currents elicited by large depolarizations were less reduced than those at smaller depolarizations (24Bean B.P. Nature. 1994; 340: 153-156Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The current-voltage relationship in Fig.4 A argues that DMPK does not have such an effect on PLM channels over the voltage range measured. Interestingly, the current-voltage relationship of currents induced by expression of phos(−) PLM did not differ from those induced by wild type PLM. This suggests that any PLM sites phosphorylated by the oocyte play no detectable role in the voltage dependence of ICl(PLM). To resolve the voltage sensitivity of the currents further, we estimated the gating valence (4Kowdley G.C. Ackerman S.J. John J.E. Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Loo D.D.F. McLarnon J.G. Vaughan P.C. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1981; 59: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fig.4 C is a plot of the log of the normalized tail current amplitude at a potential of 40 mV as a function of the conditioning 2-s hyperpolarizing step. The ordinate is interpreted as the probability of channel opening (Po) during the hyperpolarizing step. The gating valence z, the minimum number of charges traversing the full thickness of the membrane during channel opening, is related to the slope of the line, logPo/V. The straight line is of the form,z=2.303RTFlogPoVEquation 1 where R, T, and F have their usual meanings. The estimated gating valences are also given in TableI and do not differ significantly from each other.Table IBiophysical characteristics of ICl(PLM)PLMPLM plus DMPKphos(−) PLM mutantz (charges)2.42.42.3t 1/2 (msec)449531449A−0.80−0.77−0.79B−0.0024−0.0028−0.0021N1.21.21.1C0.000150.000180.00017R0.0700.0900.092z was derived from Equation 1. t 1/2 is the time to half-activation of ICl(PLM). A, B, N, C, and R are the coefficients from Equation 2. Open table in a new tab z was derived from Equation 1. t 1/2 is the time to half-activation of ICl(PLM). A, B, N, C, and R are the coefficients from Equation 2. Another mechanism by which phosphorylation might reduce current amplitude is by slowing activation kinetics. Fig. 2 F shows examples of averaged, normalized currents from oocytes expressing PLM alone and from oocytes co-expressing DMPK at a test potential of −150 mV. Each is derived from 10 to 15 traces from two or more frogs. The time courses of activation appear much the same, suggesting that phosphorylation did not affect activation kinetics significantly. These traces, and others from phos(−) PLM were fit to the expression,I(t)=A(1−exp Bt)nexp Ct+REquation 2 where I is current at time t, and A, B, N, C, and R are constants. The coefficients are given in Table I, as are the times to half-maximal activation, a model-independent measure of activation. None are significantly different from one another. Thus we find no effect on the voltage dependence of wild type PLM Cl current activation by co-expression of DMPK. Fig. 5 shows an immunoblot probed with affinity purified polyclonal antibodies to PLM 58–72, the 15-carboxyl-terminal amino acids of PLM. Each lane contains membranes from five oocytes previously used for measurement of current amplitude. The first lane shows oocytes expressing wild-type PLM alone and the second lane shows oocytes co-expressing DMPK. Consistent with the reduction in current amplitude the amount of immunoreactive PLM was greater in the oocytes expressing PLM alone compared with the oocytes co-expressing DMPK. The result was confirmed in one other immunoblot and was the same using affinity purified antibodies to PLM 1–15, the 15-amino-terminal amino acids. These data indicate that the reduction of ICl(PLM) was accompanied by a decrease in PLM expression in the oocyte membrane. To assess whether PLM is a substrate for DMPK, we have measured phosphorylation of PLM by DMPK in vitro. To assess the potential functional effects of PLM phosphorylation, we measured Cl currents induced by PLM expression in Xenopus oocytes and oocyte membrane PLM expression. Our most important findings are 1) PLM is a good substrate for DMPK in vitro; 2) co-expression of the normal DMPK with wild type PLM reduces ICl(PLM) by about half; 3) this effect is because of PLM phosphorylation, because the effect is lost if the phosphorylation sites of PLM are disabled by site-directed mutations; and 4) the reduction in current amplitude results from a reduction in oocyte membrane PLM expression. The functional effect of DMPK co-expression in Xenopusoocytes was a reduction in ICl(PLM). This reduction was abolished in a PLM mutant in which all the potential phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic domain of the molecule had been disabled by site-directed mutagenesis. This observation, taken with the results of in vitro phosphorylation experiments, suggests strongly that the effects of DMPK on ICl(PLM) were the result of PLM phosphorylation. Co-expression of PKC also causes a reduction of ICl(PLM), but dissimilar to the effects of DMPK, disabling the PLM phosphorylation sites had no effect on the response to PKC (5Mounsey J.P. Lu K.P. Patel M.K. Chen Z. Horne L.T. John E.J. Means A.R. Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PKA co-expression causes an increase in ICl(PLM) sites, which is dependent on the presence of intact PLM phosphorylation (5Mounsey J.P. Lu K.P. Patel M.K. Chen Z. Horne L.T. John E.J. Means A.R. Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This increase in ICl(PLM)is accompanied by an increase in PLM expression in the Xenopus oocyte membrane. Similar to the mechanism of PKA, the mechanism of the reduction in ICl(PLM) induced by DMPK co-expression appeared to be a reduction in PLM expression. The biophysical properties of the current were unaffected by DMPK. Patients with myotonic muscular dystrophy have abnormalities of Na2+ currents (26Franke C. Hatt H. Iaizzo P.A. Lehmann-Horn F. J. Physiol. 1990; 425: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that might lead to myotonia (27Cannon S.C. Brown R.H. Corey D.P. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 270-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and mice with DMPK deficiency have similarly abnormal Na2+channel gating. 2J. P. Mounsey, D. Mistry, S. Reddy, and J. R. Moorman, submitted for publication. A defect of Na2+ conductance may not be the only membrane electrophysiological abnormality in skeletal muscle in DM, however. Myotonia can be induced in normal skeletal muscle preparations by maneuvers that would reduce membrane Cl conductance, e.g. Cl transport blockers (29Bryant S.H. Morales-Aguilera A. J. Physiol. 1971; 219: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) or removal of external Cl (30Furman R.E. Barchi R.L. Ann. Neurology. 1978; 4: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Patients with dominant and recessive human myotonia and myotonic goats have reduced sarcolemmal Cl conductance (31Fahlke C.

Klocke R. Ortland C. Gronemeier M. Jockusch H. Gründer S. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) are linked to abnormalities of a Cl channel gene. Because Cl is the most permeant anion in skeletal muscle membranes, Cl conductance serves to oppose excitability; reduced Cl conductance results in myotonia. In patients with myotonic dystrophy, Cl conductance may be either normal or reduced, and membrane potential may be normal or depolarized (37Lipicky R.J. Rowland L.P. Pathogenesis of Human Muscular Dystrophy. Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam1977: 729-738Google Scholar, 38Gruener R. Stern L.Z. Markovitz D. Gerdes C. Muscle Nerve. 1979; 2: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The heterogeneity of the clinical syndrome may relate in part to this variability. Frankeet al. (26Franke C. Hatt H. Iaizzo P.A. Lehmann-Horn F. J. Physiol. 1990; 425: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) noted that the patients with myotonia had reduced Cl conductance and normal membrane potentials, whereas patients with predominantly dystrophic manifestations had normal Cl conductance and depolarized membrane potentials. Cl channels play important roles not only in regulation of excitability but also in regulation of cell water transport and cell division. Homologues of PLM also have roles in these physiological processes. The γ-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase co-precipitates with the a and b subunits and modulates pump activity (39Therien A.G.

A role in transmembrane ion and water movement has been suggested, as it is required for murine blastocyst cavitation (40Jones D.H. Davies T.C. Kidder G.M. J.

Mammary-associated tumor 8 is expressed in mouse breast cancers initiated by the transgenic oncogenes (41Morrison B.W. Leder P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3417-3426PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, mammary-associated tumor 8 induces hyperpolarization-activated currents similar to those induced by PLM (42Morrison B.W. Moorman J.R. Kowdley G.C. Kobayashi Y.M.

We have found that related ion channel expression induces hyperpolarization-activated currents in RNA-injected Xenopusoocytes. 3J. P. Mounsey and J. R. Moorman, unpublished observations. Channel-inducing factor was isolated from colons of rats after mineralocorticoid treatment (44Attali B. Latter H. Rachamim N. Garty H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and is constitutively expressed in kidney, where it is up-regulated by aldosterone (45Wald H. Goldstein O. Asher C. Yagil Y. Garty H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F322-F329PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, its expression in Xenopus oocytes leads to depolarization-activated K2+ currents (44Attali B. Latter H. Rachamim N. Garty H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Whereas the function of each family member may differ, they appear to share a common mechanism of action in regulation of transmembrane ion, osmolyte, and water flux. Interestingly, DMPK belongs to a new family of kinases, including the DBF2 (46Toyn J.H. Araki H. Sugino A. Johnston L.H.

https://openalex.org/W2005530515,"The receptor for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) consists of two polypeptides, the LIF receptor and gp130. Agonist stimulation has been shown previously to cause phosphorylation of gp130 on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. We found that gp130 fusion proteins were phosphorylated exclusively on Ser-782 by LIF- and growth factor-stimulated 3T3-L1 cell extracts. Ser-780 was required for phosphorylation of Ser-782 but was not itself phosphorylated. Ser-782 is located immediately N-terminal to the di-leucine motif of gp130, which regulates internalization of the receptor. Transient expression of chimeric granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR)-gp130(S782A) receptors resulted in increased cell surface expression in COS-7 cells and increased ability to induce vasoactive intestinal peptide gene expression in IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells when compared with expression of chimeric receptors containing wild-type gp130 cytoplasmic domains. These results identify Ser-782 as the major phosphorylated serine residue in human gp130 and indicate that this site regulates cell surface expression of the receptor polypeptide."

Ubiquitin content of IRS-1 is increased in the presence of IGF-I, and inhibitors of the proteasome prevented the reduction of IRS-1 levels seen following IGF-I exposure. These results imply that IRS-1 is targeted to the proteasome upon exposure to IGF-I.

The biologic responses of both IGF-I and IGF-II are mediated by the insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-IR), which shows 80% homology to the insulin receptor (IR) (6.Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kathuria S. Chen E. Jacobs S. Franke U. Ramachandran J. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). The IGF-IR is a heterotetrameric transmembrane glycoprotein composed of two extracellular α subunits and two transmembrane β subunits. The α and β subunits of the IGF-IR are synthesized as a single polypeptide that undergoes proteolytic cleavage at amino acid 710. The α and β subunits are linked in the mature IGF-IR by disulfide bonds (7.LeRoith D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 692: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The β subunits of the IGF-IR possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that is activated upon ligand binding to the α subunits. This tyrosine kinase activity is essential for the biologic activity of the IGF-IR, and mutation of the conserved ATP binding site at lysine 1003 abolishes kinase activity and mitogenic response to IGF-I. The activated IGF-IR associates with several intracellular targets in addition to the β subunit itself. These intracellular targets include the proteins Shc, Grb 2, and the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) (8.Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A.

The IRS-1 protein is part of a family of related proteins that includes at least four members, IRS-1, IRS-2 IRS-3, and IRS-4 (8.Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A.

The phosphotyrosine binding domain of IRS-1 interacts with phosphorylated NPEY motifs including tyrosine 950 in the β subunit of the IGF-IR, a site that is phosphorylated following ligand binding (14.Craparo A. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15639-15643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). IRS-1 contains 18 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites that may be phosphorylated following activation of the IGF-IR. These phosphotyrosine motifs serve as binding sites for the Src homology 2 domain containing proteins such as Nck, Grb2, Grb 10, Shc, and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (15.White M.F. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 Suppl. 2: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). These protein-protein interactions subsequently activate a series of protein-serine kinase cascades characterized by the activation of MAP kinases and PI 3-kinase that ultimately affect cellular processes such as protein synthesis, glycogen metabolism, and transcription of specific gene targets. Signals generated by IRS-1 phosphorylation are regulated through a variety of mechanisms. For example, serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 decreases tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (16.Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11222-11227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and association of IRS-1 with 14–3-3 decreases IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity (17.Ogihara T. Isobe T. Ichimura T. Taoka M. Funaki M. Sakoda H. Onishi Y. Inukai K. Anai M. Fukushima Y. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol.

Treatment of cells with okadaic acid results in an increase in serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 concomitant with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and decreased association with the insulin receptor (16.Mothe I.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6051-6057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least one specific residue, serine 612, is phosphorylated by both protein kinase C (20.De Fea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12939-12947Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (21.De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is dependent upon multiple intracellular kinases. As mentioned above, both protein kinase C and the MAP kinase cascade phosphorylate IRS-1. In addition, PI 3-kinase-dependent signals including AKT-1/PKB (protein kinase B) and PI 3-kinase itself also phosphorylate IRS-1 (22.Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y.

Phosphorylation of IRS-1 is not the only mechanism of regulation for this protein, the levels of IRS-1 are also subject to regulation. For example, chronic insulin treatment leads to decreased IRS-1 levels in 3T3 L1 adipocytes (26.Rice K.M. Turnbow M.A. Garner C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and attenuation of insulin response (26.Rice K.M. Turnbow M.A. Garner C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In this system, IRS-1 is ubiquitinated and degraded via the proteasome pathway (29.Sun X.J. Goldberg J.L. Qiao L.Y. Mitchell J.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). IGF-I also down-regulates IRS-1 in a proteasome-dependent manner in human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells. We have examined the possibility that IRS-1 levels are regulated by exposure to IGF-I. Using prostate epithelial cells, we find that IGF-I treatment targets IRS-1 for degradation via the proteasome. Interestingly, the addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) prevents the IGF-I-mediated degradation of IRS-1. Thus, we have identified a previously unidentified mechanism of IRS-1 regulation in response to IGF-I in epithelial cells, and our results indicate that cross-talk between the IGF-I R and the epidermal growth factor receptor serve to regulate IRS-1 protein levels. CPTX 1532 and NPTX 1532 cells (30.Bright R.K. Vocke C.D. Emmert-Buck M.R. Duray P.H. Solomon D. Fetsch P. Rhim J.S. Linehan W.M. Topalian S.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Keratinocyte-SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with supplements supplied by the vendor (bovine pituitary extract and EGF) and additionally supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). IGF and EGF were purchased from Intergen (Purchase, NY). RPMI and methionine-free RPMI were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cycloheximide, PD98059, LY294002, chloroquine, lactocystin, and MG132 were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The anti-IRS-1 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-β-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. The anti-ubiquitin antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). CPTX 1532 and NPTX 1532 cells were maintained in keratinocyte medium with supplements and passaged every 3–4 days using a seeding density of 1 × 104cells/cm2. All experiments followed the same protocol to transfer the cells from the growth factor-rich, undefined Keratinocyte medium into a defined medium containing only IGF-I and/or EGF. The cultures were grown to 70% confluence and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Serum-free RPMI medium was then added to the cultures with the indicated concentrations of IGF-I or EGF. The cultures were viable in the RPMI medium for a period of 2–3 days, but this medium did not support sustained proliferation. For the purposes of these experiments, the cells were incubated in the serum-free RPMI medium for up to 24 h. During this period, the cells are completely viable with no loss of cell number, and the cultures will proliferate normally if placed into complete keratinocyte medium. CPTX cell extracts were prepared by scraping cells into a lysis solution consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 160 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF. For Western analysis, equal amounts of protein (assayed using a protein assay based upon the Bradford method (31.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar) purchased from Bio-Rad) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The IRS-1 was analyzed using a standard Western blot protocol. For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts were prepared as described above. The lysates were incubated with IRS-1 antibody, collected with protein A-Sepharose beads, washed with PBS, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto membranes. IRS-1-conjugated ubiquitin was analyzed using standard Western blot procedures. Antibodies were removed from nitrocellulose filters by incubating the filters in a solution of 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, at 50 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation. The membranes were then washed twice with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 prior to Western blot analysis. Ubiquitinated IRS-1 was visualized by transfecting CPTX cells with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin cDNA in an expression construct (BSSK) provided by Dr. Dirk Bohmann (49.Lee A.V. Gooch J.L. Oesterreich S. Guler R.L. Lee D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1489-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 for 4 h in serum-free medium, a protocol that provided a transfection efficiency of ∼5% (determined using a β-galactosidase reporter construct). 24 h following transfection, cultures were washed with PBS three times and placed into RPMI medium containing IGF-I (40 ng/ml), EGF (40 ng/ml), and MG132 (10 μm) in various combinations as described in the individual experiments. Total cellular proteins were isolated after a 3-h exposure to individual growth factors, and the IRS-1 protein was immunoprecipitated as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and ubiquitinated IRS-1 was visualized using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The IRS-1 protein was visualized by Western blot analysis on the same blot following removal of the anti-HA antibody. CPTX 1532 cells were seeded in tissue culture flasks in complete keratinocyte SFM as described above. For measurements of IRS-1 degradation, cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 4 h. At this time, the cells were washed three times with PBS and placed into RPMI medium containing either EGF (40 ng/ml) or IGF-I (40 ng/ml). Total cellular proteins were isolated at time intervals, and equal amounts of protein were used to immunoprecipitate the IRS-1 protein using an anti-IRS-1 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Saranac Lake, NY). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. 35S-labeled IRS-1 was visualized by autoradiography. Measurements of the synthesis of IRS-1 involved placing CPTX cells into RPMI medium containing either EGF or IGF-I for 4 h. At this time, [32S]methionine (1 μCi/ml) was added for 1 h. Total cellular proteins were then isolated, and the IRS-1 protein was immunoprecipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography following transfer to nitrocellulose filters. The IRS-1 protein was positively identified on the autoradiograms by comparison with a Western blot of the same filter. The relative amount of 35S-labeled IRS-1 was quantitated by densitometry of the autoradiograms using a Bio-Rad Flour S system equipped with the Quantity One software, which is designed to provide quantitative measurements of densitometric scans using background subtraction algorithms. We examined whether IGF-I exposure alters IRS-1 levels in a prostate epithelial cell line, CPTX 1532, which is derived from a primary carcinoma of the prostate (30.Bright R.K. Vocke C.D. Emmert-Buck M.R. Duray P.H. Solomon D. Fetsch P. Rhim J.S. Linehan W.M. Topalian S.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar). When these cells are placed into serum-free RPMI medium, the levels of the IRS-1 protein are relatively constant, whereas the addition of IGF-I to the medium causes a decline in IRS-1 protein levels (Fig.1). The levels of IRS-1 are dramatically reduced following exposure to IGF-I for 24 h (Fig. 1). The decline in IRS-1 protein levels in response to IGF-I is dose-dependent with a maximal decrease in IRS-1 at 40–60 ng/ml of IGF-I (Fig. 2). This range of IGF-I is similar to the optimal concentration required for proliferation, which is 20–40 ng/ml (32.Pietrzkowski Z. Lammers R. Carpenter G. Soderquist A.M. Limardo M. Phillips P.D. Ullrich A. Baserga R. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 199-205PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is an increase in IRS-1 protein in cultures that are exposed to low levels (2 ng/ml) of IGF-I. This observation was consistent in several experiments but has not been investigated further at this time. A second prostate epithelial cell line derived from normal prostate epithelial tissue, NPTX 1532 (30.Bright R.K. Vocke C.D. Emmert-Buck M.R. Duray P.H. Solomon D. Fetsch P. Rhim J.S. Linehan W.M. Topalian S.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 995-1002PubMed Google Scholar), also responded to IGF-I treatment with a decline in IRS-1 protein levels (Fig. 1).Figure 2Dose dependence of IGF-I-mediated decline in IRS-1 protein. CPTX 1532 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of IGF-I in serum-free RPMI medium. As described in Fig.1, the cells were first grown to 70% confluence and then washed with PBS. Subsequently, the cells were exposed to serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing the indicated concentrations of IGF-I. IRS-1 levels were determined by Western blot analysis of total cellular protein following 16 h. As a control for protein loading, the levels of β-actin were measured on the same blot following removal of the anti-IRS-1 antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”). The experiment shown is representative of three independent experiments, which all gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The decrease in IRS-1 is specific to IGF-I, because treatment of CPTX 1532 cells with EGF over the same time period did not cause a decrease in IRS-1 levels (Fig. 1). In CPTX 1532 cells the addition of EGF or IGF-I alone will support modest proliferation (10–50% increase in cell number) for 24–48 h, and the addition of EGF plus IGF-I enhances proliferation (100–200% increase in cell number). Because EGF and IGF-I cooperate to stimulate proliferation of CPTX 1532 cells, it was of interest to determine whether the addition of EGF would mitigate the reduction in IRS-1 levels observed following IGF-I treatment. The addition of EGF simultaneously with IGF-I prevents the decrease in IRS-1 levels (Fig. 3), and this effect is dependent upon the relative ratio of IGF-I to EGF. The simultaneous addition of EGF and IGF-I prevented the IGF-I-mediated decline in IRS-1 protein levels even when EGF was present at a 3-fold lower molar ratio (Fig. 3). The addition of increasing amounts of EGF lead to a progressive increase in the level of IRS-1 in the face of an amount of IGF-I that normally induced a reduction in IRS-1 protein levels. Thus, treatment of these prostate epithelial cell lines with either EGF or IGF-I had opposing effects on the levels of IRS-1, a critical component of the IGF-IR signaling complex. It has been suggested that IRS-1 degradation may be mediated by the proteasome (29.Sun X.J. Goldberg J.L. Qiao L.Y. Mitchell J.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 50.Kornitzer D. Ciechanover A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). A specific inhibitor of the proteasome, lactocystin, has been described (34.Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). The addition of lactocystin to CPTX 1532 cells simultaneously with IGF-I prevented the IGF-I-mediated decline in IRS-1 protein levels (Fig. 4), implying that the proteasome may be involved in this process. A second inhibitor of the proteasome, MG132, also prevented the IGF-I-mediated decline in IRS-1 levels (not shown). The addition of a drug that inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis, chloroquine (35.Baldwin Jr., D. Prince M. Marshall S. Davies P. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5975-5978Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), had no effect on IGF-I-mediated IRS-1 decline. Similarly, the addition of PD98059, which inhibits the MAP kinase pathway (36.Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar), has no effect on IGF-I-mediated decreases in IRS-1 protein levels (Fig. 4). However, inhibition of the PI 3-kinase enzyme using LY294002 (37.Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4) prevented the IGF-I-mediated decline in IRS-1 levels. These results are consistent with those obtained following insulin treatment of adipocytes. In that system, inhibition of PI 3-kinase prevented the insulin-mediated decline in IRS-1 levels (38.Smith L.K. Vlahos C.J. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Garner C.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 113: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The fact that inhibition of the proteasome prevented the IGF-I-mediated decline in IRS-1 protein levels suggests that IGF-I stimulation targets IRS-1 to the proteasome. A common mechanism for the targeting of proteins to the proteasome is the covalent attachment of ubiquitin (50.Kornitzer D. Ciechanover A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Because ubiquitinated proteins are labile and anti-ubiquitin antibodies are of low affinity, we used an experimental protocol designed to enhance our ability to visualize IRS-1-associated ubiquitin. First, the time period of the exposure to growth factors was relatively short (3 h compared to 16–24 h used in Figs. 1 and 2). Second, parallel cultures were treated with inhibitors of the proteasome such as lactocystin or MG132, and finally, the CPTX 1532 cells were transiently transfected with an HA-tagged ubiquitin cDNA in a mammalian expression vector (51.Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) to allow the use of a high affinity anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5). Following immunoprecipitation with an anti-IRS-1 antibody, the ubiquitin content of IRS-1 was examined by Western blot using the anti-HA antibody (Fig.5). The ubiquitin content of the IRS-1 protein increased when CPTX 1532 cells were exposed to IGF-I, and the addition of an inhibitor of the proteasome, MG132, caused a dramatic increase in IRS-1-associated ubiquitin. The addition of fetal bovine serum or EGF does not cause any increase in the ubiquitin content of IRS-1, and the addition of equimolar amounts of EGF decreased the ubiquitin content of IRS-1. This effect is most evident in samples treated with IGF-I, MG 132, and EGF (Fig. 5). These results indicate that increased ubiquitin content of the IRS-1 protein is specific for IGF-I treatment, and the presence of EGF prevented this IGF-I-mediated ubiquitination. To determine whether the rate of IRS-1 synthesis is affected by either IGF-I or EGF, CPTX 1532 cells were exposed to IGF-I or EGF alone for 4 h and then were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h, and the amount of labeled IRS-1 was examined. This provides a quantitative measure of the rate of IRS-1 synthesis in the presence of IGF-I or EGF. The rate of IRS-1 synthesis was similar whether the cells were exposed to IGF-I or to EGF (Fig.6 A). Thus, the rate of IRS-1 synthesis does not seem to be influenced by either IGF-I or EGF. To directly measure the rate of degradation of IRS-1 in the presence of IGF-I or EGF, CPTX 1532 cells were again labeled with [35S]methionine. In this case, the cells were exposed to the [35S]methionine in the presence of normal growth medium (keratinocytes SFM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum). Following the labeling period, the cells were exposed to either IGF-1 alone (40 ng/ml) or EGF alone (40 ng/ml), and the labeled IRS-1 was examined. Over a 14-h period the level of labeled IRS-1 decreased in the presence of IGF-I, whereas the level of labeled IRS-1 was relatively constant in the presence of EGF (Fig. 6 B). Thus, IRS-1 degradation proceeds more rapidly when CPTX 1532 cells are exposed to IGF-I than when the cells are exposed to EGF. This study identifies a novel level of regulation for the IRS-1 protein in response to IGF-I stimulation in prostate epithelial cells. The results presented here indicate that IRS-1 levels fluctuate following exposure to either IGF-I or EGF. It seems that, similar to adipocytes exposed to insulin, IGF-I negatively regulates IRS-1 levels in prostate epithelial cells. Surprisingly this effect is counterbalanced by the effects of EGF, which decreases and serves to maintain IRS-1 levels in the presence of IGF-I. This is the first demonstration that an extracellular factor (EGF) can positively influence IRS-1 levels. The fact that EGF is able to modulate the levels of a signaling molecule critical to IGF-I-dependent responses implies a novel level of cross-talk between the EGF and IGF-I systems. These two growth factors cooperate to stimulate progression of fibroblast cells through G1 and into S phase (39.Scher C.D. Shepard R.C. Antoniades H.N. Stiles C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 560: 217-241PubMed Google Scholar). In BALB 3T3 cells, there is a temporal requirement for the addition of EGF and IGF-I. EGF must be present prior to IGF-I treatment. If IGF-I is added prior to EGF, and subsequently removed, BALB 3T3 cells do not proceed into S phase (39.Scher C.D. Shepard R.C. Antoniades H.N. Stiles C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 560: 217-241PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Leof E.B. Wharton W. van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 141: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 41.Pardee A.B.

Sci. 1992; 663: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This information, combined with the results presented here, suggests that one mechanism underlying this cooperation between EGF and IGF-I in prostate epithelial cells is the maintenance of IRS-1 levels. Addition of EGF antagonizes the IGF-I-dependent, proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-1 by preventing ubiquitination of IRS-1. Because IRS-1 phosphorylation regulates the activity of several critical intracellular enzymes activated by the IGF-IR, a change in the level of IRS-1 may have a profound effect on the ability of the cell to respond to mitogenic stimulation by IGF-I. In this regard, recent results using 32 D cells indicate that the levels of IRS-1 dictate the degree of mitogenic response to IGF-I (44.Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We should note that the effect of IGF-I on IRS-1 seems to be restricted to epithelial cells as the levels of IRS-1 were not altered by IGF-I treatment of WI-38 fibroblasts (data not shown). This implies that the molecular mechanisms responsible for the cooperation of growth factors in terms of mitogenic responses may vary in different cell types. In terms of cellular responses, IGF-I can stimulate proliferation or differentiation in several experimental settings. For example differentiation of muscle cell cultures is dependent upon IGF-I (45.Florini J.R. Magri K.A. Ewton D.Z. James P.L. Grindstaff K. Rotwein P.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11330-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), yet IGF-I is also mitogenic for muscle cells (47.Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, differentiation of 32 D cells in response to IGF-I is dependent upon IRS-1 (44.Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, modulation of IRS-1 levels may play a role in the type of response generated by IGF-I in prostate epithelial cells. In this light it is interesting that low levels of IGF-I actually increase IRS-1 levels in the prostate epithelial cells used in this study (see Fig. 2). Although the present study has not examined this effect in detail, the response was consistent in several experiments. Degradation of IRS-1 via the proteasome has been reported to occur in adipocytes (29.Sun X.J. Goldberg J.L. Qiao L.Y. Mitchell J.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and in human breast carcinoma cells (49.Lee A.V. Gooch J.L. Oesterreich S. Guler R.L. Lee D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1489-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, a proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-1 may have relevance in a number of cell types in addition to the prostate epithelial cells reported here. However, a modulating effect by a physiologically relevant factor such as EGF has not been reported in any other cell type, and it remains to be seen if this is a general phenomenon. The inhibitor studies presented here indicate that neither receptor endocytosis (inhibited by addition of chloroquine) nor inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway (see effects of PD98059 in Fig. 4) prevents the IGF-I-mediated decline in IRS-1 levels. It seems that ubiquitination of IRS-1 may occur prior to receptor endocytosis. Consistent with this, it has been reported that IRS-1 phosphorylation by the insulin receptor is not linked to receptor endocytosis, whereas Shc phosphorylation is linked to receptor endocytosis (48.Chow J.C. Condorelli G. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4672-4680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activation of PI 3-kinase is required for the down-regulation of IRS-1 in response to IGF-I (see effect of LY294002 in Fig. 4). Because PI 3-kinase activation is also required for insulin-mediated down-regulation of IRS-1 (38.Smith L.K. Vlahos C.J. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Garner C.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 113: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the signal transduction pathways, which trigger IRS-1 decreases in response to IGF-I and insulin, may be similar. In summary, our results indicate that the targeted degradation of IRS-1 via the proteasome occurs in response to IGF-I in prostate epithelial cells. In addition, EGF, a physiologically relevant growth factor known to act synergistically with IGF-I, prevents the degradation of IRS-1 and may enhance the mitogenic response to IGF-I. This information provides insight into a novel level of interaction between the EGF and IGF-I receptor signaling pathways that may be of particular importance in tumors harboring activating mutations in the EGF receptor."

Here we report that the testicular orphan receptor-2 (TR2) expression, which modulates many signal pathways, was completely repressed in the surgery-induced cryptorchidism of the rhesus monkey. Further studies link TR2 repression to the induction of p53 and results suggest that induced p53 could repress TR2 expression via the p53→p21→CDK→Rb→E2F signal pathway. In return, TR2 could also control the expression of p53 and Rb through the regulation of human papillomavirus 16 E6/E7 genes. Together, our data suggest a feedback control mechanism between TR2 and p53/Rb tumor suppressors, which might play important roles in male infertility associated with cryptorchidism.

Harsh B. Paz G. Yogev A. Jaffa A.J. Lessing J.B. Homonnai Z.T. Andrologia. 1992; 24: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This decrease of a few degrees in the scrotum is believed to contribute to an optimal environment for testes function. Cryptorchidism, the failure of the testes to descend into the scrotum at birth, affects 1% of newborn boys in the United States (2Villumsen A.L. Zachau-Christiansen B. Arch. Dis. Child. 1966; 41: 198-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and reports suggest that the worldwide incidence is rising (3Jensen T.K. Toppari J. Keiding N. Skakkebaek N.E. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The subsequent infertility associated with cryptorchidism is attributed to testicular suprascrotal temperature, because in situ cooling of abdominal testes in dogs and pigs results in normal spermatogenesis (4Fukui N. Jpn. Med. World. 1923; 3: 160Google Scholar, 5Frankenhuis M.T. Wensing C.J. Fertil. Steril. 1979; 31: 428-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In mice, spermatogenesis ceased when the testis was displaced surgically into the abdominal cavity and then was restored when the testis was surgically returned back into the scrotum (6Nishimune Y. Maekawa M. Sakamaki K. Haneji T. Arch. Androl. 1986; 16: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Other clinical conditions that raise scrotal temperature, such as varicocele and fever (7Sigman M. Howards S.S. Walsh P.C. Retik A.B. Stamey T.A. Vaughan J. Campbell's Urology. WB Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1992: 681-683Google Scholar) or even high ambient temperature (8Levine A.J. Mathew R.M. Chenault C.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), can also reduce sperm production. Early reports suggested that cryptorchidism could induce apoptosis in testes (9Shikone T. Billig H. Hsueh A.J.W. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, the detailed molecular mechanism of infertility associated with cryptorchidism remains unclear. Nuclear receptors constitute a superfamily of transcription factors that regulate gene expression in a wide variety of biological processes, such as growth, differentiation, and development (10Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6002) Google Scholar, 11O'Malley B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The orphan receptors belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily, although their biological significance has been debated because of the lack of known ligands for these receptors (12Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). The testicular orphan receptor-2 (TR2)1 was isolated from testes and prostate cDNA libraries and its cDNA encodes a protein of 603 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 67 kilodaltons (13Chang C. Kokontis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Chang C. Kokontis J. Acakpo-Satchivi L. Liao S. Takeda H. Chang Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The expression of TR2 has been detected in testes, ventral prostate, seminal vesicles, and many other tissues. Among these tissues and organs, the TR2 is most highly expressed in testes. Immunohistochemical staining has shown that the TR2 was localized specifically in advanced germ cells in mice (15Lee C.-H. Chang L.-M. Wei L.-N. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 44: 305-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p53 protein is a tumor suppressor that arrests the cell cycle in response to DNA damage. The p53 expression in testis is high and thought to be confined to the tetraploid (4N) pachytene spermatocytes (16Schwartz D. Goldfinger N. Rotter V. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1487-1494PubMed Google Scholar). Primary spermatocytes may be particularly sensitive to DNA damage because of the active DNA rearrangement events that occur with meiosis (17Chowdhury A.K. Steinberger A. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1970; 22: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The p53 plays a role in normal differentiation and development, and this role is strongly supported by the observation that p53 expression at midgestation is confined to the differentiation region (18Schmid P. Lorenz A. Hameister H. Montenarh M. Development. 1991; 113: 857-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in situ hybridization analyses of testes sections of the p53 promoter-CAT mice, with either a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or p53 probe, demonstrated a predominant CAT activity, indicating a cyclical pattern of p53 expression in the testes of adult mice (19Almon E. Goldfinger N. Kapon A. Schwartz D. Levine A.J. Rotter V. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The retinoblastoma gene product (Rb) is a phosphoprotein, which can both regulate cell cycle progression and inhibit apoptosis (20Herwig S. Strauss M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 581-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 21Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Weintraub R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Rb can be regulated through phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and when hyperphosphorylated Rb loses its ability to block cell-cycle progression. Upon dephosphorylation, Rb is activated and induces growth arrest at the G1 phase of the cycle. Interestingly, the Rb activity can be regulated by p53 through the induction of p21 (23El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Veleculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kunzier K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar), which is a p53 target gene and a CDK inhibitor. Increased levels of p21 result in an active, hypophosphorylated Rb that can mediate G1 arrest. Overexpression of p21 can inhibit apoptosis (24Poluha W. Poluha D.K. Chang B.C. Crosbie N.E.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), presumably through blocking Rb phosphorylation. Hence, the functional status of Rb has some potential correlation to the cellular outcome of p53-mediated events (27Cordon-Cardo C. Zhang Z.F. Dalbagni G. Dorbniak M. Charytonowicz E. Hu S.X. Xu H.J. Reuter V.E. Benedit W.F. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1217-1221PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, like the p53, Rb is also highly expressed in tetraploid pachytene spermatocytes (28Bernards R. Schackleford G.M. Gerber M.R. Horowitz J.M. Friend S.H. Schartl M. Bogenmann E. Rapaport J.M. McGee T. Dryja T.P. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6474-6478Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although cryptorchidism is known to cause infertility in man because of disruption of spermatogenesis, the exact cellular and molecular mechanism is unclear. Because the biological mechanisms of reproduction of the rhesus monkey are very similar to those of the human, surgically induced cryptorchidism is a reproducible model in which to study spermatogenesis. To investigate the molecular mechanism of male infertility caused by cryptorchidism, a model of unilateral surgical cryptorchidism in the rhesus monkey was employed. In this model, one testis was restored to its predescended position in the abdomen, whereas the other testis remained in the scrotum as an euthermic model. We report here, for the first time, that the high temperature created by the cryptorchidism repressed the TR2 and that this repressive effect may proceed through a p53→p21→CDK→E2F signal pathway. p2709TR2CAT, which links the CAT reporter gene to the TR2 5′-promoter encompassing −2709 to +22 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking region of the TR2 gene, was previously reported (29Lin D.-L. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14649-14652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The wild type p53 expression plasmid pC53-SN3 and the mutant p53 expression plasmid pC53-SCX-3, gifts of Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD) were described previously (30Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K.V. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). The plasmids full-length pGEX-Rb, pGEX-Rb large A/B pocket, and pGEX-Rb C-pocket were gifts of Dr. John Ludow (University of Rochester, Medical Center, Rochester, NY). The plasmids pBluescript-p21 and pDC-E2F1 were generous gifts from Dr. Xiao-Fan Wang (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) and Dr. David M. Livingston (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), respectively. The plasmids full-length pCDNA-Rb, pCDNA-Rb large A/B pocket, and pCDNA-Rb C pocket were generated by digesting with BamHI and EcoRI, and the BamHI-EcoRI fragments of each plasmid were then cloned separately into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the vector pCDNA3. All plasmids were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. The TR2 probe was a 423-base pair fragment upstream of the AatII site in the N-terminal of the human TR2 cDNA. The TR3 probe was a 485-base pair XcmI fragment in the N-terminal of the human TR3 cDNA. The p53 probe was a 557-base pair fragment upstream of PvuII site in the N-terminal of the human p53 cDNA. The p21 probe was a 218-base pair PstI fragment in the N-terminal of human p21 cDNA. Each probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the RediprimeTMII Random Primer Labeling System (RPN 1633, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified using Probe QuantTM G-50 Micro Columns (27–5335-01, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Adult male rhesus monkeys were raised in the Kunming Primate Center, Kunming, China. To induce unilateral cryptorchidism, monkeys were anesthetized and a small incision was made in the abdomen. The gubernaculum was cut on the right side to displace the testis into the abdomen. Suturing the inguinal canal on right side prevented the testis decent. The left testis was manipulated into the abdomen and then placed back into the scrotum to serve as an euthermic control. Both the surgically induced cryptorchid and contral-lateral sham-operated scrotal tests were removed either 1, 1.5, or 2 months after surgery. The testes were decapsulated, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C for later RNA and protein analysis. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol and then purified by guanidine-isothiocyanate CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation as described by Davis et al. (31Davis L.G. Kuehl W.M. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT1986: 322-328Google Scholar). Each RNA sample (30 μg) was size-fractionated on 1% agarose, 30% formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell, Inc.). Hybridization was carried out for 24 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSPE (1× SSPE is 0.15m NaCl, 0.01 m NaH2PO4, 0.001 m EDTA (pH 7.4)), 5× Denhardt's solution (1× Denhardt's solution is 0.02% ficoll, 0.02% polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 20 μg/ml of salmon sperm DNA, and the appropriate32P-labeled probes at 2 × 106 cpm/ml. The filters were then washed sequentially with 0.1% SDS 1× SSC, then 0.1% SDS 0.5× SSC both at room temperature, and then 0.1% SDS 0.25× SSC at 55 °C (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.3m sodium citrate), followed by exposure to PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). For the immunoprecipitation of p21 and Rb, testes samples were homogenized with polytron (SPT 10–35, Kinematica, Switzerland), lysed in cold homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20 mm KCl, 1% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing proteinase inhibitor (0.4 mg/ml pefablocSC, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstain, (Roche, 1206893) and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant was evaluated with the Bio-Rad reagent kit. The supernatant containing 500 μg of protein was incubated with primary antibody, either 65951A (Pharmingin) for p21 or 14001A (Pharmingin) for Rb, at 4 °C for 2 h before the addition of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz). The beads were collected after another 2-h incubation at 4 °C. After being washed four times with lysis buffer, the bound antigens were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.003% bromphenol blue), separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immunobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and detected by Western blotting. For the Western blot analysis, 100 μg of protein obtained from each indicated monkey testis tissue was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane to be probed with antibody sc-6243 (Santa Cruz) to detect the p53 probe. The membranes containing protein from the p21 and Rb immunoprecipitation procedures were also subjected to Western blot analysis and probed with antibodies to either p21 or Rb as appropriate. The membranes were blocked in TBST (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 137 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk) for 2 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight. Primary antibodies in TBST were added for binding at room temperature for 2 h, and then the appropriate alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz) in TBST were added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Again, the membranes were washed three times in TBST (10–15 min at room temperature), and immunoblots were developed with an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad, 170–6342) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Testis samples were fixed in Bouins's solution and embedded in paraffin. Six-micrometer sections were then mounted on gelatin-coated slides. The sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, treated with 0.2 m HCl for 25 min, 0.3% Triton for 15 min, and pretreated with proteinase K (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Sections were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and acetylated for 10 min in 0.1 m triethanolamine containing 0.25% acetic anhydride. Subsequently, the sections were prehybridized at 42 °C for 2 h in prehybridization buffer (4× SSC, 50% formamide, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 2× Denhardt's, 10% dextran sulfate). Then the sections were incubated with antisense and sense Dig-cRNA probes in prehybridization buffer at 48 °C for 18 h and then washed sequentially with 2× SSC, 1× SSC, 0.1× SSC (2× 15 min in each concentration). The detection of Dig-labeled probes was carried out using alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-Dig Fab (Roche, 1093274), as well as a mixture of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT, Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin (0.25 μg/ml) (Sigma) at 37 °C in 5% CO2, for 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with a total of 11-μg plasmid DNA (plasmid types and amounts are described in the figure legends) using the calcium phosphate method (32Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25655-25659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase expression plasmids (1 μg) were co-transfected as an internal control by which to normalize the transfection efficiency. After 24 h of transfection, the medium was changed once, and cells were cultured for another 24 h before harvesting. Cells were then lysed in 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) by subjection to three freeze-thaw cycles, and the resulting supernatants were assayed for CAT activity. The reaction product was extracted with ethyl acetate (Mallinckrodt Specialty Chemicals Co.), then applied to a thin-layer chromatography plate (TLC, Sigma), and developed in a 95% chloroform, 5% methanol solvent. The CAT activity was quantitated by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). To study the potential physiological roles of the TR2 in its major target, the testis, the total RNA from the surgery-induced cryptorchid testisversus sham-operated contralateral scrotal testis, within the same rhesus monkey, was isolated and assayed for TR2 expression. Northern blot analysis showed unexpected results with the TR2 highly expressed in sham-operated contralateral scrotal testis but completely repressed in the undescended testis (Fig.1, upper panel). In contrast, the expression of another testicular orphan receptor, TR3, isolated from the prostate and testes (33Chang C. Kokontis J. Liao S. Chang Y. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Uemura H. Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol.

Endocrine. 1998; 9: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was not significantly different between the cryptorchid and sham-operated contralateral scrotal testis (Fig. 1, middle panel). The contrasting expression patterns between TR2 and TR3 suggest that the suppression of TR2 in cryptorchidism is specific to this orphan receptor. We also examined the expression of androgen receptor and orphan receptor TR4. The expression level of androgen receptor did not change significantly or slightly increased, and the expression level of TR4 decreased but was not completely inhibited in cryptorchid testis compared with contralateral sham-operated testis (data not shown). No change or a slight increase of androgen receptor expression level in cryptorchid testis rules out the possibility of any androgen inactivation in the model. Because TR4 is closely related to TR2, the decrease of TR4 expression level is expectant. We then analyzed the p53 expression in cryptorchid testis. Northern blot and Western blot analyses showed that the expression of p53 was induced significantly, at both the mRNA (Fig. 2 A, upper panel) and protein levels (Fig. 2 B, upper panel) in cryptorchid testis, as compared with the sham-operated contralateral scrotal testis.Figure 2Induction of p53 and p21 and hypophosphorylation of Rb in the context of surgery-induced cryptorchidism in the rhesus monkey. Testis total RNA was prepared as described in Fig. 1. A, the total RNA samples obtained from the indicated rhesus monkey testes were subjected to Northern blot analysis using α-32P-labeled human p53 or p21 cDNA fragments. The same hybridization membrane was stripped and rehybridized with a β-actin gene cDNA probe to serve as an internal control for the normalization of RNA. Molecular weight markers shown on the gel are 18 and 28 S rRNAs. B, protein extracts obtained from the indicated rhesus monkey testes were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon P membrane. The membrane represented in the upper panel was first incubated with blocking buffer and then incubated with an anti-human p53 polycolonal antibody followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. The protein extracts were also immunoprecipitated with either 5 μl of anti-human p21 (middle panel) monoclonal antibody or 5 μl of anti-human Rb (lower panel) monoclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitates were separated and transferred to membranes, and Western blot analysis was performed using the same method described for p53.pp-Rb, hyperphosphorylated (inactive) form of Rb.p-Rb, hypophosphorylated (active) form of Rb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One possible mechanism to explain repression of TR2 following p53 induction in cryptorchid testis is that p53 can repress TR2 expression. To test this hypothesis, a plasmid with the TR2 promoter linked to a CAT reporter, p2709TR2CAT, was co-transfected with wild-type p53 expression plasmid pC53SN3 in various cell lines. The results showed that coexpression of wild-type p53 can repress TR2 expression in both of the p53 null cell lines, H1299 (Fig.3 A) and MCF-7 (Fig.3 B), as well as in the Rb-positive prostate cancer PC-3 cells (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, transfection of mutant p53 expression plasmid (pC53-SCX3) enhances the p2709TR2CAT activity (Fig.3 E). Coexpression of wild-type p53 in the Rb-defective SAOS-2 cells, however, causes only marginal repression of TR2 (Fig.3 D), suggesting the p53 may repress TR2 expression via the Rb signal pathway. As there is a lack of p53 response elements in the TR2 promoter (p2709TR2CAT) preventing direct p53 binding (36Lin D.-L. Wu S. Chang C. Endocrine. 1998; 8: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), indirect suppression of TR2 via a p53-related signaling pathway is likely. We then tested the potential linkage of TR2 repression in cryptorchid testis to the p53→p21→CDK→Rb signaling pathway. The same Northern blot membrane that showed the p53 induction and repression of TR2 in cryptorchid testis was reprobed with a p21 cDNA fragment. As shown in Fig. 2 A, middle panel, the p21 mRNA was induced in cryptorchid testis as compared with the sham-operated contralateral scrotal testis. Western blot analysis further confirmed that the p21 protein expression was also induced in cryptorchid testis as compared with the sham-operated contralateral scrotal testis (Fig.2 B, middle panel). The immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis showed that the active hypophosphorylated Rb form was significantly increased in cryptorchid testis as compared with the sham-operated contralateral scrotal testis (Fig. 2 B,lower panel). Together, data in Fig. 2 are consistent with the hypothesis that p53 may proceed through the p53→p21→CDK→Rb signaling pathway to repress TR2 expression in cryptorchidism. We then used the CDK inhibitor, olomoucin, to support our hypothesis that the TR2 repression in cryptorchid testis may involve the p53→p21→CDK→Rb signaling pathway. As shown in Fig.4 A, the expression of TR2 in p53 null H1299 cells was repressed by the addition of 150–250 μm olomoucin in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that CDK activity, and thus Rb phosphorylation (37Ezhevsky S.A. Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Gius D.R. Wei M.C. Dowdy S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10699-10704Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), is necessary for derepression of TR2. To further strengthen our hypothesis that the repression of TR2 expression may function through the p53→p21→CDK→Rb signaling pathway, we co-transfected Rb and p2709TR2CAT into COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 B, Rb repressed TR2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results also occurred when we replaced COS-1 cells with PC-3 cells (Fig. 4 C). It has been well documented that Rb contains several distinct domains that are able to bind to different proteins for various functions. For example, 1) the A/B pocket binds to other proteins with a LXCXE motif, 2) the C pocket binds to the C-Abl tyrosine kinase, and 3) the large A/B pocket binds to the E2F family of transcription factors (for detailed map, see Fig. 4 D). These three domains, as well as the full-length Rb, were ligated into pCDNA3 expression vectors and then separately co-transfected with p2709TR2CAT into COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 E, both the full-length Rb and Rb with large A/B domain can repress the TR2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the A/B pocket and C pocket of Rb showed only marginal effects on the repression of TR2 expression, suggesting that the large A/B domain, which binds to the E2F transcriptional factor, is required for Rb to repress TR2 expression. Co-transfection of E2F1 expression plasmid pDC-E2F1 with the p2709TR2CAT into COS-1 cells demonstrated that E2F1 could induce TR2 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 A). The addition of Rb repressed this dose-dependent induction, suggesting that the interaction of E2F and Rb is involved in the regulation of TR2 expression. It is possible that free E2F can induce TR2 expression, but the presence of Rb may titrate out this free E2F and therefore repress the induction of E2F-mediated TR2 expression. It is known that the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) gene products E6 and E7 can alter the cell cycle, and the TR2 has been shown to induce the HPV-16 expression via binding to a TR2 response element (HPV-direct repeat 4) in the long control region of HPV-16. 2C. Chang, D. L. Lin, L. Collins, and X.-M. Mu, manuscript in preparation. We also demonstrated that the HPV-16 gene products E6/E7 could regulate TR2 expression presumably through modulation of p53 and Rb expression or function. E6 functions to bind and degrade p53, whereas E7 can bind and inactivate Rb (39Moran E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine if p53- and Rb-mediated repression of TR2 expression could be reversed by the addition of E6 or E7, three E6/E7 expression plasmids were utilized. The plasmid p1304 effectively expresses E7 (40Phelps W.C. Yee C.L. Münger K. Howley P.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 539-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar); the plasmid p1321 effectively expresses E6 and E7. The plasmid p1434 is identical to p1321 except that it contains a translation termination linker in the middle of E6 and therefore only effectively expresses E7 (41Münger K. Phelps W.C. Bubb V. Howley P.M. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B, co-transfection of p1304 can completely reverse the Rb repression effect on TR2 expression in COS-1 cells. In H1299 cells and MCF-7 cells, we demonstrated that both p1321 and p1434 repress TR2 expression (Fig. 5, C and D, lanes 8 and 12, respectively). When these E6/E7 expression plasmids were co-transfected with wild type p53 expression plasmid pC53-SCN3, E6 and E7 together (Fig. 5, C and D, lanes 5–7 versus lanes 2–4) or E7 alone (Fig. 5, Cand D, lanes 9–11 versus lanes 2–4) could significantly reverse the p53 repression effect on TR2 expression. Therefore, our data demonstrate a feedback control mechanism that can further strengthen our hypothesis that the repression of TR2 expression is influenced by actions of p53 and Rb (Fig. 7). As p53 expression was confined to the tetraploid (4N) spermatocytes at the pachytene phase of meiosis (16Schwartz D. Goldfinger N. Rotter V. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1487-1494PubMed Google Scholar), the TR2 localization in the same area would provide further evidence that the TR2 repression in cryptorchid testis could be mediated through the p53 signal pathway. Using the Dig-labeled antisense TR2 cRNA probe, our in situhybridization data showed that TR2 mRNA is significantly expressed in primary spermatocytes (Fig.6 C), the cell type of testes cells most sensitive to high temperature (17Chowdhury A.K. Steinberger A. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1970; 22: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Within the primary spermatocytes, the pachytene primary spermatocytes showed the highest TR2 mRNA expression (Fig. 6, A and B). Similar TR2 and p53 expression"

Heretofore, a missing link in the fly has been the absence of any Bcl-2/Bax family members, proteins that function in mammals as regulators of mitochondrial cytochrome c release. ADrosophila homologue of the human killer protein Bok (DBok) was identified. The predicted structure of DBok is similar to pore-forming Bcl-2/Bax family members. DBok induces apoptosis in insect and human cells, which is suppressible by anti-apoptotic human Bcl-2 family proteins. A caspase inhibitor suppressed DBok-induced apoptosis but did not prevent DBok-induced cell death. Moreover, DBok targets mitochondria and triggers cytochrome c release through a caspase-independent mechanism. These characteristics of DBok reveal evolutionary conservation of cell death mechanisms in flies and humans."

S-adenosylmethionine dithiothreitol S-nitrosoglutathione methionine adenosyltransferase III orthophosphate pyrophosphate tripolyphosphate S-adenosylethionine Synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)1 plays an essential role in cellular metabolism. AdoMet is the major methyl donor in the cell and is a precursor of polyamine synthesis (1Cantoni G.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Along with ATP, AdoMet is one of the metabolites most frequently used in intermediary metabolism. Synthesis of AdoMet is the first reaction of the methylation cycle (activated methyl cycle). In its last step, methionine and tetrahydrofolate, an essential cofactor for RNA and DNA synthesis, are regenerated. In the liver, due to its central metabolic processing and distributing role, the methylation cycle has additional functions (2Mudd S.H. Poole J.R. Metabolism. 1975; 29: 707-720Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Finkelstein J.D. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1990; 1: 228-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). It is used to clear most of the excess of blood methionine after a protein-rich meal. It uses the homocysteine produced in the cycle to synthesize cysteine and glutathione, which can then be exported to other organs. Thus, synthesis of AdoMet is a key reaction to regulate and control all these important metabolic pathways. AdoMet is synthesized by the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT; ATP:l-methionine S-adenosyltransferase, EC2.5.1.6) in two consecutive reactions. The first reaction (Reaction 1) involves the synthesis of AdoMet and tripolyphosphate (PPPi) from ATP and methionine. In Reaction 2, tripolyphosphate is hydrolyzed to orthophosphate (Pi) and pyrophosphate (PPi) before the release of the products. MAT is also able to hydrolyze exogenously added tripolyphosphate.E+ATP+Met↔EMetATP→synthesisEAdoMetPPPiREACTION1EAdoMetPPPi→hydrolysisEAdoMetPPi·Pi↔E+AdoMet+PPi+PiREACTION2Although divergent sequences have been recently reported for archaea, MAT has been extremely well conserved through evolution, with 59% sequence identity being found between the human and Escherichia coli isozymes (4Graham D.E. Bock C.L. Schalk-Hihi C. Lu Z.J. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4055-4059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are three isoforms of MAT that are encoded by two genes (5Kotb M. Mudd S.H. Mato J.M. Geller A.M. Kredich N.M. Chou J.Y. Cantoni G.L. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 51-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). MATI and MATIII are tetrameric and dimeric forms, respectively, of the same gene product, which is expressed in adult liver. The MATII isoform is encoded by a different gene and is expressed in extrahepatic tissues as well as in fetal liver. MATII is a heterotetramer consisting of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits. It is an intriguing and yet unsolved question why there are two different MAT isoforms in liver. They might be an adaptation to cope with the special metabolic requirements of the liver. However, despite the importance of hepatic MAT isoforms to understand their role in liver function, they are poorly characterized. A great variability in kinetic parameters, depending on the laboratory and experimental conditions used to purify and measure MAT activity, has been reported (6Mato J.M. Avila M.A. Alvarez L. Corrales F.J. Carmel R. Jacobsen D. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the predominant liver form, MATIII, seems to have lower affinity toward its substrates and a cooperative behavior, contrasting with the other mammalian enzymes. Based on the differential properties of hepatic MAT isoforms, it has been postulated that MATIII is the truly liver-specific isoform. MATI would, as MATII outside the liver, maintain the basal AdoMet levels required by cells, whereas MATIII would be responsible for other tasks such as methionine clearance. A detailed kinetic characterization of enzymes is necessary to understand both their catalytic mechanism and their function in the cell. Here we report the partial characterization of the kinetic properties of MATIII. A hysteretic behavior has been found that could explain how the enzyme is regulated to accomplish its function in the liver. Columns and chromatography media were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech except for the HPLC column, which was from Waters. Tissue culture media was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. MATIII isozyme was purified as described previously by Cabrero et al. (7Cabrero C. Puerta J. Alemany S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. The livers of 20 male rats of about 250 g were removed and placed in 300 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 0.3m sucrose, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4. Just before homogenization, benzamidine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2-mercaptoethanol were added to final concentrations of 1 mm, 0.1 mm, and 0.1% (v/v), respectively. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column, equilibrated in buffer A (10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of KCl in the same buffer. A single peak of AdoMet synthetase activity eluted at about 220 mm KCl. Fractions containing activity were pooled and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated in buffer A containing 200 mm KCl. After washing the column first with equilibration buffer and then with buffer A, MATIII was eluted with buffer A containing 50% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The eluate was dialyzed against buffer A and loaded onto a Blue-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated in the same buffer. MATIII eluted in the flow-through. Fractions containing AdoMet synthetase activity were pooled and concentrated under nitrogen using an Amicon Ultrafiltration cell fitted with a YM30 membrane. The concentrated MATIII solution was cleared from particles and aggregates with a 0.22-μm filter, and then KCl and dithiothreitol (DTT) were added to final concentrations of 10 and 5 mm, respectively. The final MATIII solution was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Microassay, with bovine serum albumin as the standard, based on the method of Bradford (8Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzyme, estimated by an overloaded SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was over 95%. About 12 mg of protein were obtained in a typical purification. All assays were done at 37 °C. Enzyme assays were carried out in 100 μl containing 4 mmMgCl2, 250 mm KCl, 3.6 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8), and 1.6 μg of MATIII. The assay was started by addition of the substrates to a final concentration of 2 mm, unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends. The substrates were ATP/MgCl2 and methionine (2 mmeach) to measure AdoMet synthetase activity, or tripolyphosphate/MgCl2 to measure tripolyphosphatase activity. Both activities were monitored by measuring the release of Pi by the method of Lanzetta et al. (9Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar). DTT was omitted in S-nitrosylation experiments. Stimulation was carried out in 25 μl containing the same buffer composition as in the activity assays, 16 μg of MATIII, ATP/MgCl2, and methionine. At the indicated times at 37 °C, the mixture was diluted to 1 ml with the same buffer composition as before but containing tripolyphosphate as substrate. Aliquots of 100 μl were removed at different times to measure the released Pi. The final assay conditions were the same as in the regular tripolyphosphatase activity assay, except that it contained some ATP/MgCl2 and methionine but never more than 50 μm each. Hepatocytes were isolated from male rats as described previously (10Avila M.A. Carretero M.V. Rodriguez E.N. Mato J.M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Isolated hepatocytes were suspended (2 million cells/ml) in minimal essential media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10 or 500 μmmethionine, and incubated at 37 °C with a gas phase of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. After 20 min, cells were washed and fresh media containing 2 mm ethionine was added. Aliquots of 1 ml were removed at the indicated times and added to tubes containing 72 μl of 6 m perchloric acid to disrupt the cells. Cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. The amount of S-adenosylethionine (SAE) was determined by HPLC as described elsewhere (11Pérez-Mato I. Castro C. Ruiz F.A. Corrales F.J. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Identification and quantification of the SAE peak was done by comparison with standard solutions containing different amounts of SAE. The data was corrected by the percentage of viable hepatocytes, which was not altered by methionine. MAT content was assumed to be the same in both groups of cells, because it has been shown that it does not change significantly in hepatocytes cultured up to 8 h (10Avila M.A. Carretero M.V. Rodriguez E.N. Mato J.M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similarly, MAT content is not affected by the presence of methionine in the media (up to 1 mm) during this period of time. 2M. A. Avila J. M. Mato, unpublished results. The NO donor used was S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), which was prepared as described previously (12Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). S-Nitrosylation of the enzyme was carried out by incubation in the presence of the indicated concentrations of GSNO for 15 min at room temperature. The data of the substrate dependence of tripolyphosphatase activity were fitted to the Hill equation, and its stimulation was fitted to a hyperbola. A lag phase in product appearance can be described byv(t)=dPidt=vf+(vi−vf)e−ktEquation 1 where v(t) is the velocity at any given time, v i is the initial velocity,v f is the final velocity (after the lag phase), and k is the apparent rate constant for the transition. The product accumulation data were fitted to the integrated form of the above equation. Because the best fit was usually obtained with near-zero values of v i, this parameter was set to zero to have more robust fit parameters. Thus, the final linear velocity, v f, and the apparent rate constant for the transition were obtained by fitting the accumulation of Pi over time to the following expression.Pi(t)=vft−1k(1−e−kt)Equation 2 To measure MAT activity in vivo, we set two groups of cells that were incubated in the presence of low or high methionine concentration (see above). We propose a model where only MAT from cells incubated in low methionine shows a lag phase in product accumulation (see below). Thus, MAT activity in both groups of cells, expressed in terms of k cat and substrate concentration (ethionine), will be described as follows. For low methionine,dPidt=Sin[kf+(ki−kf)e−kt]Equation 3 and for high methionine,dPidt=SinkfEquation 4 where k i and k fare the initial or final k cat values, respectively, for the catalyzed global reaction, and S in is the substrate concentration inside the cell. However, the intracellular substrate concentration is not constant over time. It increases gradually until it reaches the extracellular concentration. This transport process is given by the expressiondSindt=(Sout−Sin)kTEquation 5 where S out is the extracellular substrate concentration and k T is the rate constant for the transport process. The extracellular concentration of substrate can be considered constant, because the intracellular volume is negligible. The expression for the progress of product accumulation in cells incubated in low and high methionine is obtained by integration of Equations 3 and 5 or 4 and 5, respectively. The data from measurements of MAT activity in vivo were simultaneously fitted to the following equations. For low methionine,Pi(t)=Soutkft+(ki−kf)k(1−e−kt)−kfkT(1−e−kTt)Equation 6 −(ki−kf)(k+kT)(1−e−(k+kT)t)and for high methionine,Pi(t)=Soutkft−kfkT(1−e−kTt)Equation 7 where only four parameters are needed to described the behavior of cells incubated in low and high methionine. Tripolyphosphatase activity was linear in time and with protein concentration, and no Pi release was observed in the absence of MAT or in the presence of EDTA (not shown). The enzyme showed a slightly sigmoidal behavior with substrate concentration (Hill coefficient of 1.6) and an affinity in the low micromolar range (S0.5, 23 μm) (Fig.1). The maximum velocity is around 170 nmol mg−1 min−1(kcat 7.5 min−1). The presence of methionine or ATP in the incubation media had no effect on tripolyphosphatase activity (not shown). However, AdoMet seemed to decrease cooperativity (Fig. 1), Hill coefficient from 1.6 to 0.8, without affecting significantly the affinity or the maximal activity. The time course of the AdoMet synthetase activity showed a lag phase with a half time of about 2 min (Fig.2). The steady-state activity, at 2 mm of each substrate, is about 800 nmol mg−1min−1 (k cat, 35 min−1). This lag phase was not altered by preincubation of the enzyme with any of the substrates before addition of the other one (not shown). Similarly, the presence of AdoMet, at a concentration in the range of that present at the end of the lag phase (30 μm), had no effect on latency (Fig. 2). To check the possibility of a change in the oligomeric state, a time course experiment was performed using different MAT concentrations. No change in the lag phase or activity was observed (not shown). On the contrary, the lag phase depends on substrate concentration. The higher the substrate concentration, the shorter the lag phase (Fig.3). Due to the lag phase, the kinetic characterization of the AdoMet synthetase activity is not trivial. Nevertheless, we estimated the S0.5 for ATP and methionine to be about 1 mm and 120 μm, respectively (not shown).Figure 3Effect of ATP and methionine concentrations on lag phase. Accumulation of Pi was measured at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm (○), 1.5 mm (●), and 2 mm (▵) ATP/MgCl2 plus methionine (each). The solid lines represent the non-linear regression fit to Equation 2 under “Experimental Procedures.” The parameters in the presence of 1, 1.5, and 2 mm substrate, respectively, are: v f, 414 ± 24 nmol mg−1 min−1; k, 0.13 ± 0.02 min−1; v f, 563 ± 10 nmol mg−1 min−1; k, 0.34 ± 0.02 min−1; and v f, 687 ± 7 nmol mg−1 min−1; k, 0.50 ± 0.03 min−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Tripolyphosphatase activity was slower than AdoMet synthetase activity after the lag phase. Because the measured AdoMet synthetase activity is the combination of two consecutive reactions, AdoMet synthesis and hydrolysis of tripolyphosphate, one would expect equal or faster tripolyphosphatase activity than AdoMet synthetase activity. Comparison of the time course of both activities (Fig.4) indicated that they were very similar initially. However, tripolyphosphatase activity remained the same, whereas AdoMet synthetase activity increased with time (lag phase). This result suggests that ATP and/or methionine induces a stimulation of MAT that does not take place with tripolyphosphate alone. To test this hypothesis, MAT was incubated in the presence of ATP and methionine prior to the measurement of tripolyphosphatase activity. This is equivalent to the measurement of tripolyphosphatase activity along different stages of the lag phase. It can be seen in Fig. 4 that tripolyphosphatase activity was higher after preincubation. Under these experimental conditions, a 4-fold stimulation process, with a half time of 1.5 min, was observed (not shown). The increase in activity, similar to the ratio of steady-state AdoMet synthetase to non-stimulated tripolyphosphatase activities as well as the half time suggest that the stimulation of tripolyphosphatase activity and the lag phase of AdoMet synthetase activity are the same process. To stimulate the enzyme, both ATP and methionine were necessary, but ADP and methionine or AdoMet were unable to produce any significant effect (not shown). The stimulation of MAT depended on the substrate concentration. The S0.5 for ATP and methionine were ∼760 and 120 μm, respectively (Fig. 5). The value for ATP, however, is not accurate because no saturation was achieved. The S0.5 values for MAT stimulation are very similar to those estimated for AdoMet synthetase activity. No significant cooperativity was observed. The stimulation of MAT could be due to the binding of substrates or to a subsequent step after it. The stimulation process could be considered as a regulatory mechanism of MAT to control methionine concentration. Thus, we were interested in knowing if MAT stimulation takes place also in vivo. MAT was stimulated by incubating hepatocytes in high concentration of methionine. Non-stimulated cells were incubated in low methionine media. Then, MAT activity was monitored adding fresh media containing ethionine and measuring the intracellular S-adenosylethionine (SAE). Ethionine was used to measure MAT activity in vivo instead of methionine, because SAE synthesized by MAT is not metabolized (13Lombardini J.B. Coulter A.W. Talalay P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1970; 6: 481-499PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the amount of SAE is proportional to MAT activity, without contribution by AdoMet-consuming reactions. Although both groups of cells showed a lag phase to achieve a steady-state activity (Fig.6), there was a longer delay in the cells incubated in low methionine. The time needed to equilibrate the intracellular ethionine concentration with the extracellular one should produce a lag phase. Three different processes could account for the data obtained: amino acid transport, steady-state activity, and, in the cells incubated in low methionine, stimulation of MAT. Four parameters describing these three processes were used to fit the data (Equations 6and 7 under “Experimental Procedures”): amino acid transport rate constant (0.85 min−1), initial activity (0.015 fmol cell−1 min−1), final activity (0.035 fmol cell−1 min−1), and MAT activation rate constant (0.07 min−1). The activity of MAT has been recently shown to be regulated by S-nitrosylation. Incorporation of a single NO molecule in the residue of cysteine 121 results in a decrease in AdoMet synthetase activity (11Pérez-Mato I. Castro C. Ruiz F.A. Corrales F.J. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Ruiz F. Corrales F.J. Miqueo C. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 7,S-nitrosylation of the enzyme did not have any significant effect on basal tripolyphosphatase activity. As expected, GSNO inhibited AdoMet synthetase activity (Fig. 7). Stimulation of tripolyphosphatase activity, however, was lower in the presence of a NO donor than in its absence (Fig. 8). The half time of the lag phase of the residual AdoMet synthetase activity after S-nitrosylation was not significantly different to that in the absence of NO (not shown), suggesting that stimulation of tripolyphosphatase activity was not affected by NO. To test whether NO affects directly the stimulated tripolyphosphatase activity rather than the stimulation process, a series of experiments with different sequences of stimulation/S-nitrosylation were performed. Stimulation of tripolyphosphatase activity was the same regardless the order in which S-nitrosylation was carried out (Fig. 8), indicating that NO has a direct effect on the stimulated activity.Figure 8Effect of NO on stimulation of tripolyphosphatase activity. Tripolyphosphatase activity was measured at 37 °C after different stimulation/nitrosylation protocols. Stimulation was done by incubating MATIII in the presence of 2 mm ATP plus methionine (each) for 5 min at 37 °C.S-Nitrosylation was achieved by exposing MATIII to 250 μm GSNO for 15 min at room temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The possibility of measuring independently one of the two consecutive reactions catalyzed by MAT allows us to obtain information about the rate-determining reaction. Comparison of both activities can be done by plotting AdoMet synthetase activity as a function of tripolyphosphatase activity. If the synthesis reaction would be the rate-determining step, tripolyphosphatase activity would be expected to be faster than the overall activity (AdoMet synthetase activity). Thus, a line of slope smaller than one should be obtained. On the contrary, if tripolyphosphate hydrolysis were the rate-determining step, both activities should be the same, and a line of slope one should be obtained. A line of slope greater than unity would indicate that tripolyphosphatase activity measured with exogenous tripolyphosphate is slower than the hydrolysis reaction within the overall reaction and, thus, both activities would not be comparable. Such a plot is shown in Fig. 9. Under two different conditions,S-nitrosylated and non-S-nitrosylated MAT, lines with slopes close to unity were obtained, indicating that the rate-determining reaction is tripolyphosphate hydrolysis. Our results indicate the presence of two MATIII isoforms, one with low tripolyphosphatase activity that is insensitive to NO, and another with high tripolyphosphatase activity that is inhibited by NO. Hydrolysis of tripolyphosphate is the rate-determining step in the AdoMet synthetase reaction catalyzed by both MATIII isoforms. Interconversion of the two conformations is a slow process that originates a lag phase in AdoMet synthetase activity measurements. High methionine concentration triggers formation of the high activity form both in vitro and in vivo. Although several laboratories have reported kinetic data for AdoMet synthetase activity, the properties and reaction mechanism of liver enzymes are far from clear or established. There is great variability in the reported kinetic parameters by different groups. For instance, the MATIII Km value for methionine ranges from 215 μm (14Sullivan D.M. Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1636-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) to 1–7 mm (7Cabrero C. Puerta J. Alemany S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, to our knowledge, no information about tripolyphosphatase activity of liver enzymes has been published. Our results with MATIII differ from those previously reported (7Cabrero C. Puerta J. Alemany S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Sullivan D.M. Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1636-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Pajares M.A. Durán C. Corrales F.J. Pliego M.M. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17598-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), even though the estimated kinetic parameters for AdoMet synthetase activity are in the same range. Contrary to what has been reported (7Cabrero C. Puerta J. Alemany S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Sullivan D.M. Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1636-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), in the presence of high ATP and methionine concentrations, AdoMet synthetase activity is not affected by low concentrations of AdoMet. However, tripolyphosphatase activity showed a decrease in the Hill coefficient in the presence of high AdoMet concentrations as it has been reported for AdoMet synthetase activity in previous studies (14Sullivan D.M. Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1636-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The lag phase in AdoMet synthetase activity shown here has not been mentioned before, probably because it can be easily missed if not enough data are collected at incubation times shorter than 1 or 2 min. In our hands, the specific activity of MATIII, measured in 2 mm ATP and methionine, is similar to that of E. coli MAT (16Markham G.D. Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9082-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but about an order of magnitude higher than previously reported values for MATIII (7Cabrero C. Puerta J. Alemany S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Sullivan D.M. Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1636-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,15Pajares M.A. Durán C. Corrales F.J. Pliego M.M. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17598-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This higher specific activity suggests that the enzyme we have purified is better preserved than are those with previous liver MAT preparations, probably due to the faster and better quality chromatographic equipment and media available nowadays. There is a lag phase in the rate of AdoMet synthesis. When AdoMet synthetase activity is measured over time, there is a delay to reach the steady-state activity. If tripolyphosphatase activity is measured along this lag phase, a parallel increase or stimulation of the activity is observed. The change in activity only occurs when both MAT natural substrates are present. ATP or methionine by themselves do not have any effect, and the same is true for a combination of ADP and methionine. Tripolyphosphate alone does not stimulate its hydrolysis, because no lag phase in tripolyphosphatase activity can be detected. A lag phase in yeast MAT was also reported (17Chou T.-C. Talalay P. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was shown that the AdoMet produced by the enzyme caused a stimulation of its own activity. However, in the case of the rat liver MATIII, AdoMet has no effect on either AdoMet synthetase or stimulation of tripolyphosphatase activity. Thus, the lag phase in both enzymes is probably due to different mechanisms. The presence of the lag phase complicates the kinetic studies of MAT activity, making it difficult to do measurements under initial velocity conditions. This is, probably, one of the reasons for the large variability of kinetic parameters found in the literature (reviewed in Ref. 6Mato J.M. Avila M.A. Alvarez L. Corrales F.J. Carmel R. Jacobsen D. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). ATP and methionine act as a switch between two different MATIII isoforms. There are two possible explanations for the lag phase, accumulation of an intermediate in the catalytic pathway before the release of Pi or a change in activity during the time course of the experiment. Because the time needed to achieve the steady-state is longer than the time needed to complete one catalytic cycle, accumulation of an intermediate can be ruled out as the origin of the lag phase. Thus, latency should be explained by a slow transition between two states with different specific activities. These stable states with low and high activity, before and after the lag phase, were directly monitored by their tripolyphosphatase activity, which remained linear in time in all experiments. The existence of these two different MAT isoforms is also supported by their different sensitivity to NO. Only the high tripolyphosphatase activity form is inhibited by NO. The fact that the transition is speeded up by increasing substrate concentration favors a process in which binding induces a slow conformational change versus another in which a slow equilibrium between two species is shifted because of substrate binding to one of them (18Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1999Google Scholar). Because ADP can not substitute ATP eliciting the transition, it is probable that the slow step involves some catalytic step, not just binding, presumably the synthesis of the first AdoMet molecule. The rate-determining reaction is hydrolysis of tripolyphosphate. AdoMet synthetase activity is the combination of two consecutive reactions, AdoMet synthesis and hydrolysis of tripolyphosphate. Thus, if the rate-determining step would be the synthetic reaction, the tripolyphosphatase activity measured with exogenous tripolyphosphate should be higher than AdoMet synthetase activity. At short incubation times, AdoMet synthetase activity is similar to tripolyphosphatase activity of non-stimulated MAT, whereas at longer incubation times AdoMet synthetase activity matches tripolyphosphatase activity of stimulated MAT. It seems that AdoMet synthetase activity parallels or follows the increase in tripolyphosphatase activity. Under our experimental conditions, maximal tripolyphosphatase and AdoMet synthetase activities were the same, within experimental error, indicating that the rate-determining reaction is tripolyphosphate hydrolysis. Moreover, the identical velocity of the two activities suggests that tripolyphosphatase activity measured with exogenous tripolyphosphate is equivalent to the reaction that takes place during the whole catalytic cycle. NO inhibits the tripolyphosphatase activity of the more active MAT isoform but not its induction. AdoMet synthetase and tripolyphosphatase activities show different sensitivities toward NO, with the later apparently being resistant to inhibition. However, NO inhibits tripolyphosphatase activity when measured after the lag phase. There are two possible NO actions to explain this pattern of inhibition: blocking or reducing the transition between isoforms or directly inhibiting the high tripolyphosphatase activity isoform. Our results support the later possibility, because the same tripolyphosphatase activity is measured when stimulation is carried out before or after S-nitrosylation. Moreover, the time course of the lag phase of the residual AdoMet synthetase activity is not altered by NO. Because MAT stimulation is induced by binding of ATP and methionine (although a subsequent step may be the slow process),S-nitrosylation does not appear to block the binding of these substrates, as we previously proposed (11Pérez-Mato I. Castro C. Ruiz F.A. Corrales F.J. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We can not rule out, though, the possibility of a decrease in affinity. The hysteretic behavior may function as a regulatory mechanism of MAT activity in vivo. Availability of methionine is probably the determining factor in MAT activity. Its concentration in a liver cell is approximately 50–80 μm (6Mato J.M. Avila M.A. Alvarez L. Corrales F.J. Carmel R. Jacobsen D. Homocysteine in Health and Disease. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, the low activity isoform would be the predominant MATIII species, and most of AdoMet synthesis would be carried out by MATI. However, after an increase in methionine concentration, i.e. after a protein-rich meal, conversion to the high activity MATIII would occur and methionine excess would be eliminated. The S0.5 for the stimulatory effect of methionine is 120 μm, which is in the range of methionine concentration fluctuations. Such a mechanism would be very sensitive to changes in methionine concentration. This model predicts that a lag phase in MAT activity should be observed only at low methionine concentrations, because at higher concentrations the active isoform should already be present. Experiments carried out with hepatocytes showed a longer lag phase at low methionine concentration in the incubation media. Taking into account that transport of ethionine into the cytoplasm is expected to introduce a delay, which could explain the short lag phase in high methionine, our results agree with the above model. Hysteretic behavior, defined as a slow response to changes in ligand binding, has been described for many important enzymes in metabolic regulation for a long time (reviewed in Ref. 19Frieden C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 471-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We proposed that liver MATIII should be included among these enzymes and that this behavior is an important feature for its function as the key enzyme regulating the methionine cycle in the liver. In conclusion, our results allow us to propose the mechanism depicted in Fig. 10. The key features of this mechanism are the following. There are two isoforms of rat liver MATIII. A form with low tripolyphosphatase activity that is not inhibited by NO and is present at low, physiological, methionine concentrations. Higher concentrations of methionine, in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP, induce a slow transition to a conformation with high tripolyphosphatase activity that is inhibited by NO. The transition is not affected by NO. The rate-determining reaction in the synthesis of AdoMet is hydrolysis of tripolyphosphate. The same regulation of MAT activity by methionine occurs in vivo and in vitro."

For GATA-1, attenuated expression in chimeric mice deregulates megakaryocytic progenitor cell proliferation and impairs platelet production (17Shivdasani R.A. Fujiwara Y. McDevitt M.A. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3965-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), while gene disruption blocks erythroid development at a penultimate stage (1Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3278-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), incrementally increased expression of GATA-1 has been shown to activate megakaryocytic and erythroid gene transcription in a developmentally stepwise fashion. Less well defined are regulators of GATA gene expression. The GATA-1 gene is best studied and first, a 900-bp1 proximal promoter region 5′ to exon 1a has been described which in isolation directs transcription in erythroleukemic murine erythrolukemic cells (but not 3T3 fibroblasts) in part via two inverted GATA-1 elements (20Tsai S.F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5285-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Unlike a yeast artificial chromosome construct containing the GATA-1 gene locus, however, this proximal promoter failed to support the expression of a linked GATA-1 cDNA at levels sufficient to rescue the erythroid differentiation of GATA1-deficient embryonic stem cells (22Simon M.C. Pevny L. Wiles M.V. Keller G. Costantini F. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Second, extended GATA-1 gene β-galactosidase reporter constructs recently have been testedin vivo, and an upsteam activatingelement (UAE) positioned approximately 2600 bp upstream of exon 1 was discovered to be required for efficient expression in erythroid and megakaryocytic cells (23McDevitt M.A. Fujiwara Y.

Interestingly, expression in definitive erythroid cells also was inhibited by the deletion of a downstream 3900-bp region (including intron 1 and exon 1b) (22Simon M.C. Pevny L. Wiles M.V. Keller G. Costantini F. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and within this general region an erythroid-specific hypersensitive site previously has been mapped (26Ronchi A. Ciro M. Cairns L. Cross M. Ghysdael J. Ottolenghi S. Genes Funct. 1997; 1: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Presently, possible contributions of intron 1 subdomains to high-level erythroid-restrictedGATA-1 gene transcription have been investigated further. For transiently as well as stably transfected reporter constructs, a central subdomain of intron 1 is shown to be necessary (as well as sufficient) for high-level transcription in erythroid cells, and to contain repeat consensus GATA and Ap1 elements which footprint in vivo. Also examined are rates of transcriptional initiation from exon 1a versus exon 1b in primary hematopoietic cells. These novel regulatory features of the GATA-1 gene likely exert important effects on its differential levels of expression among developmental stages, and hematopoietic lineages.

Constructs G4.5, ESI 3700, and ESI 1800 were prepared by exonuclease III deletion as follows. A parent construct (G6.8 within pGL2-Basic) (Promega, Madison, WI) was linearized with KpnI, blunted, and incubated at 32 °C with exonuclease III (50 units/μl). At defined intervals, products were blunted with S1 nuclease and self-ligated. Promoter domains then were excised using NotI (engineered site at exon 2 start codon), were cloned to pGL2-BSBasic (i.e. pGL2-Basic modified to contain the polylinker region of pBS-SK+) at SmaI and NotI sites, and sized and sequenced. G2.5 was prepared by excising a 4200-bpKpnI-NheI fragment from G6.8, and blunt ending (and self-ligating) this parent plasmid. ESI 900 was prepared by PCR using G6.8 as a template and the primers 5′-CAAACTCCTATGGGAGCTGTC-3′ and 5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA-3′. This PCR product was cloned stepwise to pCR-Script SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and to pGL2-BSBasic as aKpnI-NotI fragment. G6.8 ESIΔ 900 was prepared by replacing a 3400-bp XbaI-ClaI fragment of G6.8 with a 2450-bp SmaI-ClaI fragment from ESI 900. GFP-linked GATA-1 reporter plasmids were constructed as follow. G6.8-Luc, ESI 1800-Luc, and G6.8Δ[GATA]7Δ[Ap1]4-Luc were restricted with NotI, blunt-ended with Klenow, restricted with KpnI and ligated as a KpnI-SmaI (blunt) fragment into pEGFP1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). G6.8Δ[GATA]7-EGFP and G6.8Δ[Ap1]4-EGFP were constructed by PCR amplification using G6.8-EGFP as template and pairs of primers (containing engineeredBglII sites) that excluded either the GATA repeats or Ap1 repeats (Δ[GATA]7 pairs as 5′-GAGATATCCAGGAATACATAGTCTAGAAGAAATTAGTCTAG-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTTCGGAGGTCAGTGGACAAACATGGGTGT-3′, 5′-GAAGATCTTCACAGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGA-3′ and 5′-GATCTAGAGTCGCGGCCGCTTTACTTG-3′; Δ[Ap1]4 pairs as 5′-GAAGATCTTCGCAGAAGCACATAAAGATAAAATCTTTGTTTTCAAAGG-3′ and 5′-GATCTAGAGTCGCGGCCGCTTTACTTG-3′, 5′-GGAATACATAGTCTAGAAATACATAGTCTAG-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTTCGTCTGTCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATCTATC-3′). Products were cloned (in 3-way XbaI/BglII/NotI ligations) to pEGFP-1 and were confirmed by sequencing. In transient transfections, exponentially growing cells were adjusted to 3 × 105 c/ml in 6-well plates (3 ml per well). For SKT6-EE372 and B6SUt.Ep cells, plasmids (6.5 μg of GATA-1 reporter construct and 1.5 μg of pCMV-SEAP) (Tropix, Bedford, MA) then were diluted in Opti-MEM I medium (150 μl), incubated SuperFect reagent (60 μg) (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 15 min at 23 °C, and added to cells. At 48 h of culture, transfected cells were washed and lysed in reporter buffer (Promega, Madison WI). Cleared samples (10,000 × g for 10 min) were assayed for protein concentration (to account for a less than 2-fold variability in cell growth, recovery, and/or lysis), for SEAP activity (CSPD chemiluminescent substrate, Tropix, Bedford, MA), and for luciferase activity. In transfections of FDCER and FDCER-GATA1 cells, 12 μl of FuGENE-6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was incubated for 5 min in Opti-MEM I (100 μl), combined with plasmid DNAs (1.8 μg of GATA-1 reporter constructs plus 0.2 μg of pCMV-SEAP), and added to cells. At 24 h of culture, protein, luciferase, and SEAP were assayed. 293 cell lines (30% confluent, 100-mm dishes) were transfected using calcium phosphate, 4.5 μg of GATA-1 reporter plasmids, and 0.2 μg of pCMV-βgal. At 48 h of culture, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed. In stable transfections, GFP reporter constructs in pEGFP1 were linearized with XhoI and were electrotransfected into SKT6 cells using conditions described previously (27Gregory R.C. Jiang N. Todokoro K. Crouse J. Pacifici R.E. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 1998; 92: 1104-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FOG and GATA-1 were expressed stably in 293 cells from pEFNeo-FOG (30Tsang A.P.

Cell. 1997; 90: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) and pREP4-GATA1 vectors. pREP4-GATA1 was prepared by cloning a 1.6-kb XbaI-NotI murine GATA-1 cDNA from pCINeo-GATA1 (319 to pREP4 (Invitrogen, Palo Alto, CA). Vectors (15 μg) plus carrier DNA (5 μg) were transfected using calcium phosphate and stably transfected sublines were selected using G418 (1 mg/ml) and/or hygromycin B (75 μg/ml). Clonal lines (293-GATA1, 293-FOG, and 293-FOG-GATA1) were isolated by limiting dilution. GATA-1 and FOG expression was assayed as described below. RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies), and electrophoresed in formaldehyde-agarose gels, blotted to Nytran membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH), and fixed. 32P-Labeled probes were prepared by random priming using DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment), 50 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 25 ng of the following cDNA fragments: 1.8-kb KpnI-NotI fragment of pXMGATA-1 (murine GATA-1) (9Martin D.I. Zon L.I. Mutter G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1990; 344: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), 3.2-kb EcoRI fragment of pEFneo-FOG (murine FOG) (30Tsang A.P. Visvader J.E. Turner C.A.

Hybridizations were in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In Western blotting, cells were lysed in 7.5% glycerol, 2.5% SDS, 0.1 mdithiothreitol, 8.75 mm Tris, pH 6.8 (100 μl/106 cells), and soluble proteins were electrophoresed and blotted to nitrocellulose. The N6 antibody to GATA-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Exponentially growing SKT6 cells (4 × 108) were collected and resuspended in 4 ml of 7% fetal bovine serum in Opti-MEM I media. Methylation was achieved by incubation for 4 min at 20 °C with either 7 or 21 μl of (10.57m) DMS (Sigma) per 2 ml of cells, and was terminated by washing cells twice with 0 °C phosphate-buffered saline. Genomic DNA was extracted, and methylated guanine (G) residues were hydrolyzed by incubating 20 μg of DMS-treated genomic DNA with 0.1 mpiperidine for 10 min at 90 °C (31Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. Methods: A Companion.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 11: 164-170Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Control genomic DNA was extracted, and exposed to DMS and piperidine. 1 μg of DNA was used as a template for ligation-mediated PCR (34Muro-Pastor M.I. Gonzalez R. Strauss J. Narendja F. Scazzocchio C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1584-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Complementary strand synthesis was with primer 1A (5′-GTCTCTCCCTCCATTTCC-3′,Tm = 60 °C). Linker ligation was as described using a modified Mueller and Wold linker (32Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). PCR amplification of the double-stranded population was with primer 2A (5′-ACTGTGTTTCTGTGTTTTTCCTACC-3′, Tm = 63 °C). A third primer (3A: 5′-CTGTGTTTCTCCTACCTTTCTGTGCTTTACC-3′,Tm = 67 °C) was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The radiolabeled primer was elongated via five PCR cycles. Products were resolved in 5% gels and exposed to film. The sequencing ladder was created using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH) and pCRScript-G (7Pedone P.V. Omichinski J.G. Nony P. Trainor C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G.

Erythroid splenocytes were obtained from mice treated subcutaneously with thiamphenicol as described previously (33Miller C.P. Liu Z.Y. Noguchi C.T. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 3381-3387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stem Span medium (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) (1 × 106 cells/ml initial density) containing murine interleukin-3 (10 μg/ml) and -6 (10 ng/ml) and mSCF (50 ng/ml) (granulocyte/macrophage, 7-day culture); hEpo (1 unit/ml), mSCF (100 ng/ml), human insulin-like growth factor-1 (40 ng/ml), 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1 μm β-estradiol (erythroid cells, 3-day culture); murine interleukin-3 (10 ng/ml) and hTpo (50 ng/ml) (megakaryocytic cells, 4-day culture). cDNA was synthesized using an oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II RNase H−reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). Products derived from exon 1a versus 1b of endogenous GATA-1gene were amplified using the following primers: 5′−GAACTCGTCATACCAGTAA−3′ (exon 1a); 5′−AAAAAGAGGAAATGGAGGAGGC−3′ (exon 1b); and 5′−GTGGAATCTGATGGTGAGG−3′ (exon 2, used to amplify each product). 1 μCi of [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was included in each reaction, and thermal cycles were 1 min at 92 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, 2 min at 72 °C for 32 cycles. Products were electrophoresed in 5% acrylamide gels and analyzed by autoradiography. Cycle sequencing reactions were performed using 3′ BigDye-labeled dideoxynucleotide triphosphates and an ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer ABI, Foster City, CA). Putative elements for transcription factor binding were defined using Sequence Interpretation Tools software. In primary analyses of GATA-1 gene subdomains that affect erythroid-specific transcription, the deletion constructs illustrated in Fig. 1 were prepared from a parent construct, G6.8-Luc, and assayed for activity in erythroid SKT6 cells. Within G6.8-Luc, 6800 bp 5′ to exon 1a are retained, including the UAE and additional upstream sequences. In G4.5-Luc and G2.5-Luc, upstream sequences of 2300 and 4300 bp are deleted, respectively. In G6.8-ESIΔ900, upstream regions are intact but a central 900-bp subdomain of intron 1 (bounded by exons 1a and 1b and designated ESI, erythroid-specificintron) is deleted. Finally, in ESI 3700-Luc, ESI 1800-Luc, and ESI 900-Luc, subdomains of intron 1 alone are represented, and are fused to a luciferase cassette immediately upstream from a unique translational start codon in exon 2 of the GATA-1 gene (as are all luciferase and GFP reporter constructs). Activities of the above constructs in transiently transfected SKT6 cells are illustrated in Fig. 2, upper panel. For G4.5-Luc, activity reproducibly was observed to be increased 2-fold over G6.8-Luc upon the deletion of an apparently repressing 2300-bp region upstream of the UAE. Consistent with the results of in vivo studies (21Nicolis S. Bertini C. Ronchi A. Crotta S. Lanfranco L. Moroni E. Giglioni E.B. Ottolenghi S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5285-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Simon M.C. Pevny L. Wiles M.V. Keller G. Costantini F. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) deletion (from G6.8-Luc) of the UAE in construct G2.5-Luc inhibited transcription in SKT6 cells by approximately 10-fold (as compared with G4.5). More remarkably, in G6.8ESIΔ900 the deletion of a central subdomain of intron 1 inhibited transcription as severely as the deletion of the UAE (i.e.≥10-fold inhibition). In addition, when fused directly to a luciferase reporter cassette, a proximal 1800-bp region of this intron (construct ESI 1800-Luc) promoted transcription in transiently transfected SKT6 cells at rates as high as ≥10-fold above those observed for G6.8-Luc and G4.5. Within ESI 1800-Luc, the deletion of a distal 900-bp region (yielding the construct ESI 900) abrogated activity, further delineating strong positively acting elements within intron 1 to a central subdomain. Finally, in the construct ESI 3700 inclusion of a further 5′ region of intron decreased activity in SKT6 cells, indicating the possible presence of inhibitory elements within the far upstream region of intron 1.Figure 2Deletion of an intron 1 central subdomain inhibits high level, erythroid-specific GATA-1 gene transcription. Erythroid SKT6 cells, erythroid FDCER-GATA-1 cells, and myeloid FDCER cells were transfected in triplicate with the GATA-1 gene luciferase reporter deletion constructs G6.8, G4.5, G2.5, G6.8ESIΔ900 (left panels), or with the intron 1-derived constructs ESI-3700, -1800, -900 (right panels). Through co-transfection, pSEAP was used to account for limited variability in transfections. Graphed for each construct are transcriptional activities (luciferase units) as mean values ± S.D. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments (note the differences in ordinate scales for deletion versusintron-derived constructs).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the extent to which the above delineated GATA-1gene subdomains might regulate transcription selectively in erythroid cells, reporter constructs also were assayed in a uniquely advantageous pair of cell lines, i.e. FDCW2ER and FDCW2ER-GATA-1 cells. FDCW2ER cells are a well characterized myeloid progenitor cell line in which no expression of GATA-1, EKLF, Epo receptor, or globin gene transcripts is detectable, while FDCW2ER-GATA-1 cells are a derived subline in which the stable expression of exogenous GATA-1 activates endogenous erythroid gene expression, including GATA-1, EKLF, and βmaj globin (19Seshasayee D. Gaines P. Wojchowski D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3278-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In erythroid FDCW2ER-GATA-1 cells, those GATA-1 gene constructs which possessed high transcriptional activities in erythroid SKT6 cells (i.e.G6.8-, G4.5-, and ESI 1800-Luc) likewise were transcribed at high rates (Fig. 2, center panels). In myeloid FDCW2ER cells, however, transcription of these constructs was uniformly low (Fig. 2,lower panels) while activities of constructs G2.5 and ESI 900 were elevated. These results reinforced the above findings in SKT6 cells, and indicate that a central 900-bp domain of intron 1 contains elements that strongly promote erythroid-restricted GATA-1gene transcription. In addition, the elevated activities of constructs G2.5 and ESI 900 in myeloid FDCERW2ER cells at least suggest that domains −4500 to −2500 and +1800 to +900, while activating in red cells, might also repress transcription in other lineages. Activities of the above GATA-1 promoter constructs also were assayed in erythroid B6SUt.Ep cells (28Quelle F.W. Wojchowski D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 609-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and activity profiles were observed to sharply parallel those observed in SKT6 and FDCW2ER-GATA-1 cells. 2D. Seshasayee, unpublished data. Based on the above characterized role for a central subdomain of intron 1 in erythroid-specific transcriptional activity, this region of the murine GATA-1gene next was sequenced (Fig.3). Sequencing revealed first the occurrence of several GATA elements as well as a CACC element within a proximal 900-bp region. In addition, positioned in an immediately upstream region were clusters of seven contiguous consensus GATA elements (bold and underlined) and four adjacent Ap1 elements (italicized and underlined). The functional significance of these latter repeated elements next was tested in three ways. The ability of GATA-1, FOG, or GATA-1 plus FOG to activate the above described transcriptional reporter constructs in 293 fibroblasts was assessed; repeat domains were assessed for trans-factor occupancy in erythroid SKT6 cells by in vivo footprinting; and relative rates of transcription from promoters positioned upstream of exon 1a versus 1b were assayed. For investigations in 293 fibroblasts, GATA-1 and/or FOG were expressed stably and in the derived cell lines 293-GATA-1, 293-FOG-GATA-1, and 293-FOG, transcription from select transiently transfected GATA-1 reporter constructs was assayed (Fig.4 A). In 293-GATA-1 cells, GATA-1 per se had little effect on the activities of either G6.8 or G6.8-ESIΔ900 constructs (the latter of which is designated G6.8Δ [GATA]7Δ[Ap]4 based on sequencing). For the intron 1 construct ESI 1800-Luc, however, rates of transcription due to GATA-1 expression were increased by approximately 6-fold (see Fig. 4 A, second panel and lower summary panel). Also, in ESI 900-Luc this effect was limited (to approximately a 2-fold induction) due to the deletion of this intron 1 central subdomain. In 293-GATA-1-FOG cells, the co-expression of FOG with GATA-1 did not significantly affect the transcription of the intron 1 constructs ESI 3700, 1800, or 900, but did reproducibly increase transcription from the GATA-1 gene constructs G6.8-Luc and G4.5-Luc approximately 2-fold (in 293-FOG cells, FOG alone did not exert this effect). As a further positive control, 293 sublines also were transiently transfected with a reporter that contains a 545-bp promoter region of the mu"

We studied the chaperonin GroEL and its interaction with the enzyme human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II), which induces unfolding of the enzyme. We focused on conformational changes that occur in GroEL during formation of the GroEL-HCA II complex. We measured the rate of GroEL cysteine reactivity toward iodo[2-14C]acetic acid and found that the cysteines become more accessible during binding of a cysteine free mutant of HCA II. Spin labeling of GroEL with N-(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrrolidinyl)iodoacetamide revealed that this additional binding occurred because buried cysteine residues become accessible during HCA II binding. In addition, a GroEL variant labeled with 6-iodoacetamidofluorescein exhibited decreased fluorescence anisotropy upon HCA II binding, which resembles the effect of GroES/ATP binding. Furthermore, by producing cysteine-modified GroEL with the spin labelN-(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrrolidinyl)iodoacetamide and the fluorescent label 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, we detected increases in spin-label mobility and fluorescence intensity in GroEL upon HCA II binding. Together, these results show that conformational changes occur in the chaperonin as a consequence of protein substrate binding. Together with previous results on the unfoldase activity of GroEL, we suggest that the chaperonin opens up as the substrate protein binds. This opening mechanism may induce stretching of the protein, which would account for reported unfoldase activity of GroEL and might explain how GroEL can actively chaperone proteins larger than HCA II.

However, it has been found that under many circumstances productive protein folding is not achieved as easily as previously postulated (1Anfinsen C.B. Haber E. Sela M. White Jr., H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1309-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 2Anfinsen C.H. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5217) Google Scholar). In living cells, molecular chaperones facilitate protein folding by preventing misfolding and aggregation. We have previously shown that renaturing of fully GdnHCl1-unfolded human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II) yields approximately 70% native protein under optimal refolding conditions. However, the Escherichia coli chaperonin GroEL can assist HCA II during refolding, increasing the yield to 100%, and it can also protect thermally denatured HCA II from irreversible aggregation. This process does not require ATP or GroES binding (3Persson M. Aronsson G Bergenhem N. Freskgård P.-O. Jonsson B.-H. Surin B.P. Spangfort M.D. Carlsson U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Previous investigations have shown that GroEL possesses unfoldase activity (4Zahn R. Spitzfaden C. Ottiger M. Wüthrich K. Plückthun A. Nature. 1994; 368: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 5Zahn R. Perret S. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Zahn R.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that GroEL can, in a passive mass action manner, bind to partially unfolded proteins as they are populated (9Walter S. Lorimer G.H. Schmid F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9425-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). During the GroEL-HCA II interaction, GroEL not only passively binds to a population of partially unfolded proteins but causes further unfolding of the substrate upon binding (8Persson M. Hammarström P. Lindgren M. Jonsson B.-H. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This action is achieved by GroEL alone and does not require the complete GroEL/ES/ATP system, as, for example, is seen for ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (10Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Thirumalai D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4030-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar,11Shtilerman M. Lorimer G.H. Englander S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Recently, a chaperone-percolator model has been suggested, in which the chaperones do not generally unfold their targets, but by a multidirectional expansion preferentially loosen the core structure and during expansion water molecules enter the hydrophobic core of the protein substrate (12Csermely P. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is possible that the energy of binding of the chaperone to the substrate protein is used to unfold the substrate and thereby give it a new chance to refold correctly (5Zahn R. Perret S. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); however, the detailed mechanism is not known. Furthermore, this unfoldase activity could require a substantial conformational change in GroEL enabling unfolding of the protein substrate. It was recently shown that binding of peptides to GroEL induces conformational changes in the substrate binding region in the apical domain. This structural plasticity was suggested to account for the promiscuous recognition of protein substrates (13Chen L. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The present study focuses on how GroEL-assisted refolding of HCA II is achieved. In previous folding studies of HCA II (14Freskgård P.-O. Carlsson U. Mårtensson L.-G. Jonsson B.-H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Mårtensson L.-G.

Lindgren M. Mårtensson L.-G. Gentile M. Borén K. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8606-8620Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we used carboxymethylation of cysteine residues to probe side chain accessibility/compactness of surrounding structure. Here, a similar approach is used to probe accessibility of cysteines in GroEL as a means of monitoring conformational changes. Each subunit of GroEL contains three cysteine residues, Cys-138, Cys-458, and Cys-519, which are all situated in the equatorial and intermediate domains (Fig.1). We found an increased rate of carboxymethylation of cysteine residues in the intermediate/equatorial domain of GroEL, indicating conformational changes in the chaperonin upon binding of partially unfolded HCA II. According to spin-labeling experiments, this increase in cysteine accessibility could be attributed to buried cysteine residues. We also analyzed fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence resonance energy homotransfer from fluorescein-labeled GroEL, as well as the spectroscopic characteristics of IAEDANS- and IPSL-labeled GroEL, to investigate the conformational changes in GroEL upon binding of HCA II. The results of these measurements taken together with the reactivity data show that the accessibility of GroEL cysteines and the dynamics at these sites increase when the protein substrate is bound. By these and previous results (8Persson M. Hammarström P. Lindgren M. Jonsson B.-H. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we suggest that the mechanism of the GroEL machinery is as follows. The chaperonin expands upon binding to a substrate protein, which further unfolds the substrate protein in a process similar to the stretching of an elastic sticker attached to a balloon during inflation; this action smoothes out the surface of the folding energy landscape and thereby allows the protein to fold correctly.

Acta. 1996; 1298: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). HCA IIpwt, a C206S mutant of cloned HCA II, was produced as described previously (15Mårtensson L.-G. Jonsson B.-H. Freskgård P.-O Kihlgren A. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The GroEL concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad Bradford bovine serum albumin assay. HCA IIpwt concentration was determined by absorbance measurements using ε280 nm = 54,800m−1 cm−1(18Nyman P.-O. Lindskog S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 85: 141-151PubMed Google Scholar). In all measurements concerning the interaction between HCA IIpwt and GroEL, an incubation buffer was used containing 200 mm GdnHCl and 100 mm Tris-H2SO4, pH 7.5. 0.1 nmol of GroEL was incubated in a final volume of 100 μl of incubation buffer at 20 °C and 50 °C in the presence and absence of HCA IIpwt for 1 h with a 41 molar excess of iodo[2-14C]acetic acid over GroEL tetradecamer. The reaction was quenched by addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 1.3 m; the proteins were precipitated with 100 μl of 50% (w/w) trichloroacetic acid, 0.2% (w/w) deoxycholate, and 300 μl of ice cold distilled water, and were left on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation. The precipitate was washed four times with 200 μl of ice-cold distilled water and was thereafter dissolved in 200 μl of 5.9 m GdnHCl. The protein solution was incubated in 15 ml of scintillation mixture (Aqua Safe 300 Plus), and the cpm value from each sample was measured in a Beckman LS-6500 scintillator. This procedure was repeated for three different samples both in the presence and absence of equimolar concentrations of HCA IIpwt. Incorporation of iodo[2-14C]acetic acid was also measured on HCA IIpwt (three samples) at 50 °C as a control. This value was then subtracted from that obtained from GroEL-HCAIIpwt labeling. An additional control experiment was made on extensively unfolded HCA IIpwt to probe for nonspecific modification by iodo[2-14C]acetic acid, by unfolding HCA IIpwt in 5.0 m GdnHCl at 50 °C. This cpm h−1 value (104 cpm h−1) was lower than that obtained in 0.2m GdnHCl (molten globule state of HCA IIpwt, which was 337 cpm h−1). Labeling with 6-IAF was done by adding 0.75 μm GroEL to a 1400-μl solution of 90 mmTris-H2SO4, pH 7.5, containing a 400-fold molar excess of label. The reaction was quenched by addition of a 2-fold molar excess of 2-mercaptoethanol over reagent and IAF-GroEL was purified by gel filtration on a PD-10 column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-H2SO4, pH 7.5. The degree of labeling was obtained by absorbance measurements at 495 nm for 6-IAF using ε495 = 81,000m−1 cm−1(19Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 6th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1996Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter equipped with a thermostatted sample cell connected to a circulating water bath. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were conduced with excitation in the range 460–505 nm and recording of the emission spectra in the range 510–600 nm using 5- and 2.5-nm slits for excitation and emission, respectively. Fluorescence polarization spectra were recorded by the use of sheet polarizers, and the spectra were corrected for unequal transmission efficiencies of vertically and horizontally polarized light. Measurements were conducted on samples containing 18 nm tetradecameric IAF-GroEL. To some of the samples a 1:1 molar ratio of HCA IIpwt or a 2:1 molar ratio of GroES and 1 mm Mg-ATP were added to the IAF-GroEL solution. Spectra were recorded after incubation at the temperature of interest for 1 h. IAF-GroEL and unlabeled GroEL were subjected to gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-100 HR gel filtration column (of length 28 cm and diameter 2 cm). Fluorophores, such as fluorescein, with small Stokes shifts can undergo fluorescence self-transfer, also known as homo-FRET, which is detected by depolarization of the emission light (20Weber G. Biochem. J. 1960; 75: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer is sensitive to the distance between donor and acceptor sites, and therefore homo-FRET can be used to estimate the distance between fluorescein molecules. A thorough description of the background of fluorescein-fluorescein homo-FRET, was reported by Hamman et al. (21Hamman B.D. Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Traut R.R. Jameson D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16672-16679Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and we briefly summarize some of the useful equations below. A steady state expression for the efficiency of energy transfer (E) as a function of fluorescence anisotropy is described by Equation 1.E=2(r01−〈r〉)/r01Equation 1 〈r〉 is the observed anisotropy and r 01 is the anisotropy in the absence of energy transfer. E is dependent on the distance, R, between the fluorophores as described by Equation 2.E=R06/(R06+R6)Equation 2 R 0 is the Förster radius,i.e. the distance between the probes for 50% energy transfer. R 0 was determined by Hamman et al. (21Hamman B.D. Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Traut R.R. Jameson D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16672-16679Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to be 40 Å for the fluorescein-fluorescein pair. 1 μm GroEL was added to 500 μl of 100 mm Tris-H2SO4, pH 7.5 containing a 420-fold molar excess of 1,5-IAEDANS. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight in the dark, and excess reagent was removed by five rounds of dialysis versus 10 mmTris-H2SO4, pH 7.5, for 3 days. The degree of labeling was obtained by absorbance measurements at 337 nm for AEDANS using ε337 = 6100m−1cm−1. Samples containing 80 nm tetradecameric AEDANS-GroEL in incubation buffer was measured under various conditions. Fluorescence spectra were recorded between 380–600 nm after 1 h of incubation at the temperature of interest by excitation at 350 nm, using 5-nm slits for both excitation and emission light. Cysteine modification experiments were as follows; 1.2 μm GroEL was mixed in a total volume of 500 μl of 100 mmTris-H2SO4, pH 7.5, containing 200 mm GdnHCl. In one experiment a 1:1 molar ratio of HCA IIpwt was added. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 50 °C in the presence of a 400-fold molar excess of IPSL. The reaction was then quenched by addition of a 2-fold molar excess of 2-mercaptoethanol over IPSL and the samples were then dialyzed for 3 days with four changes versus 300 ml of 10 mmTris-H2SO4, pH 7.5. Before the EPR measurements were conducted, a 1:1 molar ratio of HCA IIpwt was added to GroEL labeled in the absence of HCA IIpwt in order have identical protein mixtures. The EPR measurements were conducted at 20 °C. In another experiment, 3.5 μm GroEL was mixed in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-H2SO4, pH 7.5, containing a 400-fold molar excess of IPSL. The reaction was allowed to proceed over night at 20 °C in the dark, and excess reagent was removed by five rounds of dialysis versus 10 mmTris-H2SO4, pH 7.5, for 3 days. Samples for EPR measurements were prepared with 0.66 μm IPSL-GroEL in incubation buffer, and the degree of labeling was estimated from the EPR signal. Spectra were recorded after 1 h of incubation at the temperature of interest. The EPR spectrometer, measurements, and temperature control were set up as described previously (8Persson M. Hammarström P. Lindgren M. Jonsson B.-H. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We also evaluated the chaperone activity of IAF-GroEL, AEDANS-GroEL, and IPSL-GroEL on HCA IIpwt under the equivalent conditions as the corresponding fluorescence and EPR measurements. The enzyme was heat-denatured at 50 °C in incubation buffer for 1 h in the absence and presence of equimolar concentrations of GroEL variants and was subsequently cooled down to 20 °C to refold. This procedure has previously been described by Persson et al. (17Persson M. Bergenhem N. Carlsson U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); however, a 2-fold molar excess of GroEL was used in those experiments. By heating, it was impossible to induce the molten-globule conformation of HCA II at a temperature that GroEL will withstand without being heat-denatured, because a temperature of 60–65 °C was required to complete the transition to the molten globule from the native state of HCA II (8Persson M. Hammarström P. Lindgren M. Jonsson B.-H. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, all experiments on GroEL in this study were performed in buffers containing 0.2 m GdnHCl as in the cited study. By this GdnHCl inclusion, the molten-globule state was reached at 50 °C, and at this temperature HCA II was chaperoned by GroEL, whereas at 60 °C no chaperone activity was detected (8Persson M. Hammarström P. Lindgren M. Jonsson B.-H. Svensson M. Carlsson U. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Another reason for performing the experiments in low concentrations of GdnHCl is that previous cited GroEL-mediated refolding studies on HCA II have been performed in this medium (3Persson M. Aronsson G Bergenhem N. Freskgård P.-O. Jonsson B.-H. Surin B.P. Spangfort M.D. Carlsson U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Persson M. Bergenhem N. Carlsson U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Persson M. Carlsson U. Bergenhem N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), permitting us to make comparisons under similar conditions. It has previously been demonstrated that the function of GroEL can be influenced by GdnHCl (23Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In that study it was shown that low concentrations of GdnHCl decreased the ATPase activity of GroEL and destabilized the GroEL/ES complex, thus relieving the inhibition of GroEL ATPase by GroES. However, the refolding of HCA II can be efficiently assisted by GroEL without GroES and ATP (3Persson M. Aronsson G Bergenhem N. Freskgård P.-O. Jonsson B.-H. Surin B.P. Spangfort M.D. Carlsson U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Since GroEL alone is used in this study, the known effects by GdnHCl on the chaperonin should be offset. In a control experiment, both the spontaneous and the GroEL-mediated refolding behavior of HCA II were also shown to be very similar in urea (0.6 m) and GdnHCl (0.2 m) (data not shown). In our GroES binding studies (Fig. 3 A), we do not include GdnHCl, because of the reported effect by GdnHCl on the GroEL/ES complex (23Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5388-5394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig.2 summarizes the results of iodo[2-14C]acetic acid labeling experiments. At 20 °C, only minor modification of GroEL was achieved and there was no significant difference between results obtained with GroEL alone or in the presence of HCA IIpwt. However, at 50 °C in the presence of HCA IIpwt, as compared with GroEL alone, there was a 45% increase in the rate of incorporation of radioactivity, which indicates increased cysteine modification in GroEL in the presence of protein substrate. This can be attributed only to GroEL, since the small rate of nonspecific incorporation of iodo[2-14C]acetic acid to the cysteine-free (C206S) HCA IIpwt was subtracted from that of the GroEL-HCA IIpwt complex. GroEL incorporated 5.5 6-IAF labels/GroEL tetradecamer. Furthermore, on average, GroEL was modified with 14 IPSL spin labels. Using 1,5-IAEDANS, the degree of labeling was 12 AEDANS labels/GroEL tetradecamer. From the stoichiometry of the labeling, one single cysteine per subunit of GroEL might have been modified; however, a distribution of labeled sites cannot be excluded. These findings are very similar to the results previously presented by Hansen and Gafni (24Hansen J.E. Gafni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6286-6289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both AEDANS-GroEL and IPSL- GroEL actively protect HCA IIpwtfrom thermal aggregation, as shown in TableI, which agrees with earlier results obtained with unlabeled GroEL (17Persson M. Bergenhem N. Carlsson U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). IAF-GroEL had the same effect as unlabeled GroEL on binding and inhibition of thermally unfolded HCA IIpwt. However, the release mechanism seemed to be impaired, because only a minute amount of HCA IIpwt was recovered (Table I). Furthermore, the yield of active HCA II was lower in the presence of IAF-GroEL than in the spontaneous reaction, which has also been reported for fluorescein-maleimide-labeled GroEL (25Jai E.A. Horowitz P.M. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 3: 387-396Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Addition of GroES and ATP did not induce further release of HCA IIpwt (data not shown).Table IReactivation of heat-denatured HCA IIpwt in presence and absence of equimolar amounts of AEDANS-GroEL, IAF-GroEL, and IPSL-GroELProteinsDenaturation/reactivation1-aDenaturation (d) for 1 h in 50 °C followed by refolding (r) by lowering the temperature to 20 °C.Yield after 3 h of reactivation%HCA IIpwtd, 50 °C for 1 h/r, 20 °C30HCA IIpwt, AEDANS-GroELd, 50 °C for 1 h/r, 20 °C77HCA IIpwt, IAF-GroELd, 50 °C for 1 h/r, 20 °C16HCA IIpwt, IPSL-GroELd, 50 °C for 1 h/r, 20 °C771-a Denaturation (d) for 1 h in 50 °C followed by refolding (r) by lowering the temperature to 20 °C. Open table in a new tab In light of the impaired chaperone activity of IAF-GroEL, we subjected the chaperonin to gel filtration to determine whether its oligomeric structure had undergone dissociation as a result of the fluorescein labeling, as was recently reported for GroEL with extensively labeled cysteines (25Jai E.A. Horowitz P.M. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 3: 387-396Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26Bochareva E. Safro M. Girshovich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20756-20758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The oligomeric structure was found to be intact, because no monomeric GroEL could be detected (data not shown). The same results have been reported for GroEL labeled with 7 fluorescein-maleimide labels/tetradecamer (25Jai E.A. Horowitz P.M. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 3: 387-396Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It was possible to use fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein-labeled GroEL to detect conformational changes in GroEL due to the short lifetime of the fluorophore (approximately 4 ns; Ref. 27Thevenin B.J. Periasamy N. Shohet S.B. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1741-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the binding studies of HCA IIpwt, we added 200 mm GdnHCl to the samples (incubation buffer; see above). As can be seen in Fig.3 (compare the solid line curve with filled circles in A with the upper solid line curve with the same symbols in B), the anisotropy decreased. Thus, that amount of denaturant apparently increased the mobility of the fluorescein labels attached to GroEL. However, most importantly, at 50 °C the anisotropy was smaller in the presence (Fig. 3 B,lower curve, open circles,dotted line) than in the absence (Fig.3 B, lower curve, filled circles, solid line) of HCA IIpwt, indicating that a conformational change occurs in GroEL upon binding of the protein substrate. Fluorescein has a very small Stokes shift; thus, its absorption and emission spectra overlap, and it can therefore display fluorescence resonance energy homotransfer if two fluorophores are within 20–70 Å of each other (21Hamman B.D. Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Traut R.R. Jameson D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16672-16679Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fluorescence anisotropy of IAF-GroEL plotted versus the excitation wavelength is shown in Fig. 3 A (filled circles,solid line). The red-edge excitation anisotropy dependence of IAF-GroEL indicates homo-FRET in the protein. This is evident, because the anisotropy increases at longer wavelengths (at the red-edge of the excitation spectra), where homo-FRET fails at low energy excitation (20Weber G. Biochem. J. 1960; 75: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 28Weber G. Shinitzky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 65: 823-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Förster radius is 40 Å for the fluorescein-fluorescein pair (21Hamman B.D. Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Traut R.R. Jameson D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16672-16679Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The dependence on excitation wavelength was not detected for unfolded GroEL in 6 mGdnHCl (Fig. 3 A, filled triangles,solid line), which demonstrates that the homo-FRET requires intact GroEL structure. The fluorescence anisotropy in the absence of energy transfer, r 01, must be known in order to determine the interprobe distances in IAF-GroEL (see Equation 1 under “Experimental Procedures”). The red-edge excitation increase in anisotropy will end at this value (20Weber G. Biochem. J. 1960; 75: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar); hence, we used fluorescence anisotropy in the interval 495–505 nm for linear curve fitting and, after extrapolation, to estimate the r 01 value in the interval 522–528 nm (21Hamman B.D. Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Traut R.R. Jameson D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16672-16679Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the r 01 estimated values could be used together with the measured fluorescence anisotropy in the interval 460–480 nm to estimate the interprobe distances within the IAF-GroEL protein. This gave values of about 37 Å, which shows that IAF-GroEL is oligomeric; otherwise, homo-FRET would not be possible. Fig.3 A also illustrates the detected fluorescence anisotropy of IAF-GroEL alone at 23 °C (filled circles,solid line) and IAF-GroEL in complex with GroES and ATP (open circles, dotted line). The fluorescence anisotropy decreased uniformly over the entire excitation region upon binding of GroES at 23 °C (Fig.3 A, compare the upper two curves); thus, no major changes in interprobe distance were expected. Almost identical curves were noted for the fluorescence anisotropy of IAF-GroEL, with or without the presence of HCA IIpwt at 20 °C (Fig. 3 B, upper curves). Notably, the fluorescence anisotropy here changes, upon an increase in temperature: lower for the sample containing HCA IIpwt. Thermally unfolded HCA II is known to interact more strongly with GroEL than the conformation it takes at 20 °C, and it can be concluded that the change in fluorescence anisotropy is a result of the GroEL-HCA"

Our previous data showed that exposure of cardiac myocytes to low K+ increased the steady-state abundance of Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit mRNA.

Orlowski J. Shull M.M. Price E.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 38: 37-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). By its continuous function coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP, Na,K-ATPase is directly responsible for maintaining transmembrane gradients of Na+ and K+, resting membrane potentials, control of cell volume, and a significant portion of basal energy utilization. By virtue of its predominant role in the regulation of intracellular Na+, Na,K-ATPase is also of vital importance in the control of the intracellular concentrations of calcium and hydrogen ions whose transport are coupled to Na+. Na,K-ATPase consists of two noncovalently linked, dissimilar subunits, α and β, present in equimolar amounts (2Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 694: 27-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar).

A pretranslational mechanism has been implicated in the up-regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity based on the finding of either low K+- or ouabain-mediated augmentation of Na,K-ATPase subunit mRNA contents in established cell lines such as Madin-Darby canine kidney and ARL-15 (18Bowen J.W. McDonough A. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C179-C189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pressley T.A. Ismail-Beigi F. Gick G.G. Edelman I.S. Am. J.

Physiol. 1992; 263: C436-C442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and neonatal rat ventricle (21Qin X. Liu B. Gick G. Am. J. Hypertens. 1994; 7: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our previous transient transfection studies demonstrated that the region between −102 to +151 base pairs of the rat Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit gene is necessary for up-regulation of β1 mRNA content in response to incubation of primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in low extracellular K+ (21Qin X. Liu B. Gick G. Am. J. Hypertens. 1994; 7: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that neither the DNA sequence element(s) nor the trans-acting factor(s) responsible for control of Na,K-ATPase subunit gene expression in response to either low K+ or ouabain have been defined. In the present studies, we have further delineated the molecular mechanism underlying regulation of Na,K-ATPase β1 gene expression in response to low extracellular K+ in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Our results indicate that low K+ mediates an increase in β1 subunit gene transcription that is dependent on extracellular Ca2+. Transient transfection studies with 5′ deletion and mutant constructs revealed that two GC box elements in the proximal β1 gene promoter between nucleotides −102 and −42 are necessary for transcriptional up-regulation mediated by low K+. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift and transient transfection assays show that increased binding of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to these GC box sequences are required to elicit the low K+response. Neonatal rats (1-day-old) of the Harlan Sprague-Dawley strain were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, K+-free and K+- and Ca2+-free Williams' E medium, serum, Lipofectin, oligonucleotides, and nick-translation kits were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Luciferase assay systems and Taq polymerase were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Protein assay kits were from Bio-Rad. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products, Inc. (Boston, MA) and BA-85 nitrocellulose filters from Schleicher & Schuell (Keene, NH). Site-directed mutagenesis kits were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Ultraspec RNA isolation systems were from Biotecx Laboratories (Houston, TX). Sp1, Sp3, and USF-1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma and were analytical grade or better. Construction of luciferase plasmids containing the −102 to +151 and −41 to +151 base pair regions of the rat Na,K-ATPase β1 gene was described previously (21Qin X. Liu B. Gick G. Am. J. Hypertens. 1994; 7: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Wendt C.H. Towle H. Sharma R. Duvick S. Kawakami K. Gick G. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C356-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter plasmids containing the promoter regions of the chicken myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2) (−222 to +158) and rat angiotensinogen (−688 to +39) genes were provided by M. A. Q. Siddiqui and A. Brasier, respectively. The generation of a luciferase plasmid harboring the −157 to −38 base pair region of the β1 gene upstream of the minimal promoter of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) has been reported (22Wendt C.H. Towle H. Sharma R. Duvick S. Kawakami K. Gick G. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C356-C364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase constructs that contain β1 promoter sequences from −84 to +151 and −62 to +151 base pairs were synthesized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Oligonucleotides from −84 to +151 and −62 to +151 base pairs were generated by PCR using the −102/+151 β1 region as a template. The reactions were performed in a total volume of 100 μl containing 1 μg of template, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2 μm of each primer (5′ primers, GCGGATCCGATTGGCCTGCGGT and GCGGATCCTAGGCGGAGCTAC; 3′ primer, GCAAGCTTGCATGCAGG) 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm K+Cl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. 25 cycles were run, each cycle included 94 °C for 15 s (denaturation), 70 °C for 15 s (annealing), and 72 °C for 1 min and 15 s (elongation). The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of the luciferase vector pXP1. The PCR to synthesize the −55 to +151 oligonucleotide was performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 30 ng of template, 0.1 mm dNTPs, 0.1 nm of each primer (5′ primer, AAAGAATCCGAGCTACGGATGGTGGAGGC; 3′ primer, CTTGAATCCCCTGCTGCTTCAAG), 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 10 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The run included 28 cycles, each cycle included: denaturation for 1 min and 30 s (96 °C), annealing for 40 s (60 °C) and elongation for 1 min and 30 s (68 °C). The PCR fragment was ligated into pXP1. Each 5′ deletion clone was sequenced to confirm the appropriate sequence. A single GC box mutant that changed GCG to TTT in the −58/−56 region of the β1 promoter was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The luciferase plasmid containing the β1 gene −102 to +151 region was used as a template with two synthetic oligonucleotides containing the GC box mutation (forward primer, CGGTGCCGCCGGTAGTTTGAGCTACGGATGGTGGAG; reverse primer, CTCCACCATCCGTAGCTCAAACTACCGGCGGCACCG). A double mutant that changed the −58/−56 and −67/−65 sequences from GCG and CGC to AGA and TCT, respectively, was produced using the Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and mutant primers (forward primer, CGATTGGCCTGCGGTGCTCTCGGTAGAGAGAGCTACGGATGG; reverse primer, CCATCCGTAGCTCTCTCTACCGAGAGCACCGCAGGCCAATCG). PCR amplification was carried as detailed in the manufacturer's protocol with 10 ng of luciferase plasmid containing the β1 gene −102 to +151 region as a template and 125 ng of each primer. This double mutant was used as a template to generate a triple GC box mutant with the additional change of nucleotides at −101/−99 from CGC to TCT using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and mutant primers (forward primer, GCTCAGATCTCGAGGCCCTCTCTTCTCGGCACCGGC; reverse primer, GCCGGTGCCGAGAAGAGAGGGCCTCGAGATCTGAGC). All site-directed mutants were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were prepared and incubated as described previously (21Qin X. Liu B. Gick G. Am. J. Hypertens. 1994; 7: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricles from 1 to 3-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were minced and subjected to consecutive digestion with trypsin and DNase I. Cells were preplated for 30 min at 37 °C and myocytes (2826/mm2) remaining in suspension were added to plates coated with 1% gelatin. Cardiac myocytes were incubated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum, 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine, and antibiotics at 37 °C in humidified air with 7% CO2. In the majority of experiments, cells were transfected by an overnight incubation at 3% CO2 with calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitates. To minimize the potential effect of increased intracellular Ca2+ on transfection analysis, in one set of experiments cardiac myocytes were transfected overnight with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In experiments designed to evaluate the effect of contraction on transfected gene expression, cells were washed with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 24 h in serum-free, K+-free Willliams' E medium supplemented to a final concentration of 5.4 mmK+ with either 54 mm K+, 10 μm verapamil, or 7.5 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM). In all other transfection experiments, cardiac myocytes were preincubated for 24 h in serum-free, K+-free Willliams' E medium supplemented to a final concentration of 5.4 mm K+ and then exposed to reduced concentrations of K+ for 1 day. Cells were lysed and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured in cell extracts as described previously (21Qin X. Liu B. Gick G. Am. J. Hypertens. 1994; 7: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was quantitated using a Bio-Rad assay system. It was determined that the expression of a co-transfected CMV/β-galactosidase vector was significantly regulated by exposure to low K+, high K+, verapamil or BDM. In three experiments in which four plates were transfected with the −102/+151 β1/luciferase plasmid, we found that the variation of luciferase activity expressed relative to total protein was 7 ± 0.7% (p < 0.05). Luciferase activities were therefore normalized to total cellular protein. Neonatal rat heart cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum for 2 days and then preincubated for 24 h in serum-free, K+-free Willliams' E medium supplemented to a final concentration of 5.4 mm K+. Cells were washed with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in K+-free Williams' E medium supplemented with either 5.4 or 0.3 mm K+ for 6 h. In parallel, cardiac myocytes were incubated with 0.1 mm EGTA in the presence and absence of 2.1 mm Ca2+ for 6 h and the effect of low K+ was assessed. Cells were lysed with 5 ml of Ultraspec RNA isolation reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.) containing guanidinium thiocyanate and phenol and Northern blot analysis was conducted as previously detailed (21Qin X. Liu B. Gick G. Am. J. Hypertens. 1994; 7: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (10 μg) was resolved on 1% agarose gels containing 5% formaldehyde and RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were prehybridized overnight at 42 °C in 5 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5 × Denhardts, 50% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.9), 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml sonicated, sperm DNA. A Na,K-ATPase β1 cDNA was labeled with 32P by nick-translation and blots were hybridized in a solution containing 5 × SSC, 1 × Denhardts, 50% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 6.9), 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml sperm DNA. After a 3-day incubation at 42 °C, membranes were washed with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS twice at 55 °C for 15 min. Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit mRNA was detected and quantitated by PhosphorImaging analysis. The method used for preparing nuclear extracts was a modified Dignam protocol (23Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Cells (25 × 106) were washed twice with ice-cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 1.5 ml of ice-cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 s at room temperature. To rupture cell membranes, pellets were resuspended in 5 volumes of an ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, incubated on ice for 10 min and vortexed vigorously for 20 s. The homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 s. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of a buffer comprised of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin and incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C, the supernatant containing nuclear proteins was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad kit. Double-stranded oligonucleotides spanning three potential GC box elements in the rat Na,K-ATPase β1 gene promoter were commercially synthesized. In addition, corresponding oligonucleotides were prepared with the core GCG sequences mutated to either TTT or AGA. Wild type and mutant oligonucleotides were labeled using the Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and used as probes. Nuclear extract isolated from cardiac myocytes cultured in either 5.4 or 0.3 mm K+ for 1 day was incubated in a 15-μl reaction with 1 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (2 to 5 × 105 cpm) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 15 min at room temperature. For oligonucleotide competition experiments, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 15 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of labeled probe and incubation for 15 min at room temperature. For supershift experiments, antibodies were preincubated with nuclear extracts for 15 min at 4 °C and then incubated with probe at 4 °C for an additional 15 min. Reaction mixtures were applied to a 6% polyacrylamide gel and DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis under low ionic strength conditions (0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer) at 15 mA at 4 °C. The gel was dried under vacuum and analyzed by PhosphorImaging. Student's t tests and ANOVA were utilized to determine the significance of results. Our previous study (21Qin X. Liu B. Gick G. Am. J. Hypertens. 1994; 7: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) showed that incubation of primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes with low extracellular K+ increased the steady-state level of Na,K-ATPase β1 mRNA and enhanced luciferase activity driven by the −102 to +151-base pair region of the rat β1 gene. To further delineate the molecular mechanism which underlies the low K+ effect on Na,K-ATPase β1 gene expression, neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing portions of the rat β1 promoter between −102 to +151 or −41 to +151 base pairs. Exposure of cells to 0.3 mm K+ for 1 day resulted in a 2.6 ± 0.3-fold increase in luciferase activity by the −102 to +151-base pair region, whereas the −41 to +151 portion of the β1 promoter was unresponsive to low K+ (Fig.1 A). These data indicate that the low K+ response is transcriptional and is mediated by a DNA element between nucleotides −102 to −42 of the rat Na,K-ATPase β1 gene. To begin to assess the selectivity of the low K+response, we examined the effect of low K+ on MLC-2 and angiotensinogen transcription in transient transfection experiments (Fig. 1 B). In cells treated with 0.3 mmK+ for 1 day, luciferase activity directed by the rat angiotensinogen gene promoter was unaffected by low K+. By contrast, luciferase expression was augmented 4.8 ± 0.5-fold by low K+ in cells transfected with a reporter plasmid containing the proximal promoter region of the chicken MLC-2 gene. To examine whether the −102 to −42 region of the β1 gene functions as a promoter-independent enhancer in mediating the low K+effect, we subcloned the −157 to −38-base pair region of the β1 gene into a luciferase vector driven by the proximal promoter of MMTV and evaluated its response to low K+ (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, low K+ treatment had no stimulatory effect on this heterologous promoter suggesting that the low K+ response element requires the native β1 gene promoter to function. A physiological reduction in serum K+ in the range of 2 to 3 mm has been shown to regulate Na,K-ATPase subunit gene expression in a tissue-dependent manner (24Azuma K.K. Hensley C.B. Putnam D.S. McDonough A.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 29: C958-C964Crossref Google Scholar). By contrast, incubation of cardiac myocytes in a medium containing a K+ concentration of 1 mm or lower leads to Na,K-ATPase inhibition (10Kim S.D. Smith T.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit gene transcription was regulated by either a physiological decrease in K+concentration or a prolonged inhibition of Na,K-ATPase function, the effect of several concentrations of K+ on β1 gene activity was assessed in transient transfection experiments in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (Fig.2). Relative to control cells incubated with 5.4 mm K+, treatment with 2 mmK+ had no effect on luciferase activity of the −102 to +151 base pair construct while exposure to 1, 0.6, or 0.3 mm K+ for 1 day resulted in stimulation of chimeric gene expression. Thus, a physiological concentration of K+, 2 mm, did not stimulate Na,K-ATPase β1 expression, suggesting that partial inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity due to a limiting concentration of K+ was a necessary first step in the signal transduction pathway which ultimately up-regulates β1 gene transcription. Partial inhibition of Na,K-ATPase function by low external K+ yields an increase in the intracellular concentration of Na+ and a subsequent elevation in cytoplasmic Ca2+ as a consequence of reduced Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity (10Kim S.D. Smith T.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Given the central role that Ca2+ plays in a myriad of signal transduction systems, we evaluated the effect of the absence of extracellular Ca2+ on the low K+-mediated enhancement of Na,K-ATPase β1 gene expression. We first incubated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in the absence and presence of Ca2+ and assessed the effect of low K+ on β1 mRNA content (Fig. 3, Aand B). In the presence of a normal concentration of Ca2+ (2.1 mm), incubation of cells for 6 h with 0.3 mm K+ yielded a 1.3 ± 0.1-fold increase in Na,K-ATPase β1 mRNA abundance. The low K+effect was abrogated, however, when cardiac myocytes were cultured in Ca2+-free medium containing 0.1 mm EGTA and then challenged with 0.3 mm K+ for 6 h. Thus, low K+ stimulation of β1 mRNA levels requires extracellular Ca2+. It is also important to note the withdrawal of Ca2+ was associated with a significant decrease in the content of β1 mRNA, suggesting that Ca2+ by itself is capable of regulating Na,K-ATPase β1 gene expression. To further investigate the role of Ca2+ in the low K+ effect on β1 gene transcription, we compared the effect of low K+ in the absence and presence of extracellular Ca2+ on the expression of the −102 to +151 β1 gene construct (Fig. 3 C). Treatment of cardiac myocytes with 0.3 mm K+ for 6 h had no effect on luciferase activity, either in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+, when cells were transfected with a standard calcium phosphate method. An extracellular Ca2+-dependent 1.5 ± 0.1-fold increase in luciferase activity was produced in response to a 6-h exposure to low K+, however, when cells were transfected with Lipofectin. This result is consistent with the finding that the low K+effect on β1 mRNA requires extracellular Ca2+. The reason for the discrepancy in the transient transfection results with calcium phosphate versus Lipofectin transfection is not known. We speculate that the influx of Ca2+ that occurs with the calcium phosphate transfection procedure and the early time point of analysis may be involved, since we have demonstrated in transient transfection experiments utilizing either calcium phosphate coprecipitation or Lipofectin that exposure to 0.3 mmK+ for 24 h augments β1 chimeric gene expression to the same extent (data not shown). To initiate an investigation of the DNA sequence motif involved in low K+-induced activation of Na,K-ATPase β1 gene expression, we carried out a computer-assisted examination of the −102 to −42 base pair low K+ response region for the presence of potential transcription factor binding elements (Fig.4 A). Putative CAAT and AP-2 motifs were identified at positions −84 and −78, respectively, relative to the transcription start site of the β1 gene. In addition, a potential GC box and E box were located at positions −61 and −49, respectively. E box elements are binding sites for members of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors (25Dang C.V. Dolde C. Gillison M.L. Kato G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding of a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein to an E box motif has been shown to be necessary for contractile-mediated up-regulation of the rat α-myosin heavy chain promoter (26Ojamaa K. Samarel A.M. Klein I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 31276-31281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since low K+ treatment of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes leads to enhanced contractile activity and the low K+ response region contains a potential E box element, we evaluated the effect of contraction on Na,K-ATPase β1 gene transcription in transient transfection studies (Fig. 4 B). Cultures of spontaneously contracting neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were transfected with the −102 to +151 β1 promoter construct and treated for 24 h with 54 mm K+, 10 μm verapamil, or 7.5 mm BDM in serum-free medium. All three interventions inhibit contractile activity of cultured cardiac myocytes; however, they exert distinct effects on intracellular Ca2+ (27Eble D.M. Cadre B.M. Qi M. Bers D.M. Samarel A.M. J. Cell. Mol. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 55-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). High K+ causes membrane depolarization and elevates intracellular Ca2+whereas verapamil and BDM decrease the intracellular concen"
https://openalex.org/W2000163935,"Previous studies using chemical modification approach have shown the importance of arginine residues in bile salt activation of carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) activity. However, the x-ray crystal structure of CEL failed to show the involvement of arginine residues in CEL-bile salt interaction. The current study used a site-specific mutagenesis approach to determine the role of arginine residues 63 and 423 in bile salt-dependent and bile salt-independent hydrolytic activities of rat CEL. Mutations of Arg63 to Ala63 (R63A) and Arg423 to Gly423 (R423G) resulted in enzymes with increased bile salt-independent hydrolytic activity against lysophosphatidylcholine, having 6.5- and 2-fold higherk cat values, respectively, in comparison to wild type CEL. In contrast, the R63A and R423A mutant enzymes displayed 5- and 11-fold decreases in k cat, in comparison with wild type CEL, for bile salt-dependent cholesteryl ester hydrolysis. Although taurocholate induced similar changes in circular dichroism spectra for wild type, R63A, and R423G proteins, this bile salt was less efficient in protecting the mutant enzymes against thermal inactivation in comparison with control CEL. Lipid binding studies revealed less R63A and R423G mutant CEL were bound to 1,2-diolein monolayer at saturation compared with wild type CEL. These results, along with computer modeling of the CEL protein, indicated that Arg63 and Arg423 are not involved directly with monomeric bile salt binding. However, these residues participate in micellar bile salt modulation of CEL enzymatic activity through intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the C-terminal domain. These residues are also important, probably through similar intramolecular hydrogen bond formation, in stabilizing the enzyme in solution and at the lipid-water interface.

Hydrolysis of water-insoluble substrates such as cholesteryl esters and triglycerides by CEL is dependent on its activation by trihydroxylated bile salts; dihydroxylated bile salts are ineffective in CEL activation. In contrast, CEL hydrolysis of water-soluble substrates such as lysophospholipids can proceed in the absence of bile salt. Although bile salt activation of CEL activity has been shown to be a direct consequence of bile salt binding to the enzyme, the mechanism by which bile salt-CEL interaction modulates substrate reactivity has not been established.

Fontaine R.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16801-16806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19DiPersio L.P. Fontaine R.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol.

One unique feature of CEL is a series of proline-rich repeating units immediately preceding a well-conserved 6-amino acid sequence at the C terminus of the protein. The number of these proline-rich repeats differs among CEL from various species, ranging from 3 repeats in the bovine CEL to 16 repeats in the human enzyme. Truncation mutagenesis studies revealed that deletion of these proline-rich repeating units resulted in a protein with lowerKm and higher V max for cholesteryl oleate hydrolysis at reduced bile salt concentrations when compared with the native CEL (21DiPersio L.P. Carter C.P. Hui D.Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3442-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results suggested the potential role of the proline-rich repeats and the C-terminal domain in bile salt modulation of CEL enzymatic activity. Recent x-ray crystal structure analysis of the bovine CEL provided further support to this hypothesis (22Wang X. Wang C.S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Chen J.C.H. Miercke L.J.W. Krucinski J. Starr J.R. Saenz G. Wang X. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Ellsworth J.L. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5107-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These latter studies revealed that CEL is different from other triglyceride lipases with the absence of an amphipathic helical lid covering the active site domain. In contrast, the C-terminal peptide was found to be lodged in the active site domain diverting the oxyanion hole away from the productive binding site and the catalytic Ser194 (23Chen J.C.H. Miercke L.J.W. Krucinski J. Starr J.R. Saenz G. Wang X. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Ellsworth J.L. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5107-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The authors of the latter study suggested that bile salt binding to a site proximal to the catalytic triad will move the C-terminal peptide away from the active site, thus allowing easier access of the substrate. Crystal structure data of bovine CEL-taurocholate complex are consistent with bile salt interaction with a hairpin loop near the active site domain (22Wang X. Wang C.S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Early studies using chemical modification approaches have identified the importance of tyrosine and arginine residues for CEL interaction with bile salts (24Campese D. Lombardo D. Multigner L. Lafont H. deCaro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 784: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25Lombardo D. Campese D. Multigner L. LaFont H. DeCaro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Computer modeling of CEL structure has led to the suggestion of the involvement of Tyr123 and Arg63 in this process (26Gjellesvik D.R. Lorens J.B. Male R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although Tyr123 is within the hairpin loop structure near the active site domain, thus consistent with its participation in bile salt activation of the enzyme, the involvement of Arg63 in this process is not immediately obvious from the crystal structure data of the protein. In contrast, Arg63 was shown to be part of a positively-charged cluster located on the CEL surface (22Wang X. Wang C.S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This cluster, along with a second positive-charged cluster consisting of seven residues, including Arg423 (22Wang X. Wang C.S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), has also been proposed to facilitate the binding of micelles to CEL (22Wang X. Wang C.S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of Arg63 and Arg423 in modulating CEL enzymatic activities remains speculative. The goal of the current study is to use a site-specific mutagenesis approach to determine the functional significance of these two well-conserved residues in CEL activities. Mutagenesis was performed using the oligonucleotide-directed method described of Zoller and Smith (27Zoller M.J. Smith M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 468-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) with Kunkel's modifications (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar), as described previously (18DiPersio L.P. Fontaine R.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol.

The design and exact sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used in this study are shown in Table I. The resultant clones were screened initially by restriction digestion. Potential positive clones were further analyzed by complete nucleotide sequencing of the CEL cDNA insert to verify that no additional mutations were made.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for site-directed mutagenesisI.R63A mutationAmino acids 58–68Thr Asp Phe Lys Lys Arg Cys Leu Gln Ala ThrDNA sequence5′-ACA GAC TTC AAG AAA CGA TGT CTA CAA GCC ACCComplementary DNA3′-TGT CTG AAG TTC TTT GCT ACA GAT GTT CGG TGGPrimer3′-TGT CTG AAG TTC TTT CGTACG GAT GTT CGG TGGComplementary DNA5′-ACA GAC TTC AAG AAA GCA TGC CTA CAA GCC ACCAmino acidsThr Asp Phe Lys LysAla Cys Leu Gln Ala ThrII.R423G mutationAmino acids 417–427Leu Phe Ser His Pro Ser Arg Met Pro Ile TyrDNA sequence5′-CTG TTT TCC CAC CCT TCA CGA ATG CCT ATC TACComplementary DNA3′-GAC AAA AGG GTG GGA AGT GCT TAC GGA TAG ATGPrimer3′-GAC AAA AGG GTG GGAAGGCCT TAC GGA TAG ATGComplementary DNA5′-CTG TTT TCC CAC CCT TCC GGA ATG CCT ATC TACAmino acidsLeu Phe Ser His Pro Ser Gly Met Pro Ile TyrThe DNA codons and the resulting amino acid substitutions areunderlined.

The double underlined codons were designed to introduce a new restriction site to each sequence without modification of the amino acid sequence. A 2-kilobase cDNA fragment containing the entire coding region of either the wild type rat CEL, R63A mutant CEL, or R423G mutant CEL was isolated and then subcloned into the adenoviral transfer vector pQBI-AdBM5-PAG (Quantum Biotechnologies, Inc.), which has previously been linearized by PmeI digestion and dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase. This subcloning procedure effectively placed the CEL expression under the control of the adenoviral major late promoter 5. A transcription termination signal was provided by the human β-globin polyadenylation signal included in the transfer vector. Positive clones with vectors containing the wild type rat CEL, the R63A mutant, or the R423G mutant form of rat CEL were purified, linearized by digestion with EcoRI, and then used for transfection into human 293a kidney cells in the presence of the transfection reagent SuperFect (Qiagen). Recombinant adenoviruses that had undergone homologous recombination were identified by screening of isolated plaques. An aliquot of each culture medium was isolated for screening of CEL secretion by Western blot analysis using a rabbit anti-rat CEL antibody (29DiPersio L.P. Kissel J.A. Hui D.Y. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The medium in wells with the highest CEL titer was collected and stored at −80 °C. Another aliquot of 50 μl of the medium was used for further viral expansion in 293a cells maintained in T75 tissue culture flasks. Conditioned medium from recombinant adenovirus-infected 293a cells were collected and centrifuged at 3000 × rpm for 15 min to precipitate insoluble material. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter, and 400 ml of the filtered medium was then applied to a 20-ml heparin-Sepharose column for affinity purification using the procedure as described (29DiPersio L.P. Kissel J.A. Hui D.Y. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The elution profile was monitored for protein concentration by absorbance at 280 nm and by CEL immunoreactivity with anti-rat CEL on Western blot (29DiPersio L.P. Kissel J.A. Hui D.Y. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fractions from the heparin-Sepharose column containing the CEL peak were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration on a fast performance liquid chromatography Sephacryl-200 column equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.6, 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.5% glycerol. Samples were collected in 2-ml fractions. The elution profile was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm and by CEL immunoreactivity with anti-CEL on Western blot. Fractions containing CEL-immunoreactive proteins were pooled and concentrated. Protein concentration of the pooled fraction was determined by Lowry's method (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purity was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Enzymatic activities of the purified recombinant CEL were characterized by cholesteryl [14C]oleate hydrolysis in the presence of 14.5 mm taurocholate and the hydrolysis of [1-14C]palmitoyll-lyso-3-phosphatidylcholine in the absence of bile salt, using the exact procedures as described previously (18DiPersio L.P. Fontaine R.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16801-16806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments to measure bile salt protection of the enzyme against thermal denaturation, aliquots of 10 ng of wild type and mutant CEL were incubated with or without 5 mm taurocholate or deoxycholate at 50 °C. The taurocholate concentration of each sample was then adjusted to 14.5 mm before measuring residual cholesteryl [14C]oleate hydrolytic activity at 37 °C. Circular dichroism spectra of purified recombinant CEL were obtained by placing 0.1 mg/ml purified CEL in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, with or without bile salt into a crystal cuvette with a 0.1-cm path length. The sample was then scanned at wavelengths from 250 to 185 nm using a Jasco J710 spectropolarimeter operating at room temperature as described (31Jacobson P.W. Wiesenfeld P.W. Gallo L.L. Tate R.L. Osborne Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 515-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the serine-reactive reagent diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) reacts with a 1:1 stoichiometry with CEL (18DiPersio L.P. Fontaine R.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16801-16806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Rudd E.A. Mizuno N.K. Brockman H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 918: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although DFP modification results in enzyme inactivation (32Rudd E.A. Mizuno N.K. Brockman H.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 918: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), DFP-labeled CEL retains its ability to bind lipid surfaces and can be absorbed onto the lipid surface at the water-lipid interface (33Tsujita T. Brockman H.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8423-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, [3H]DFP-labeled recombinant CEL was used to directly assess the lipid-interfacial binding properties of wild type and mutant CEL. The radiolabeled catalytically inactive wild type and mutant CEL were prepared by treating the enzymes with [3H]DFP as described previously (18DiPersio L.P. Fontaine R.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16801-16806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Tsujita T. Brockman H.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8423-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Tsujita T. Smaby J.M. Brockman H.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8430-8434Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of each protein was calculated as dpm/μg of protein. Binding of [3H]DFP-labeled recombinant CEL to lipid films was performed according to the modified procedure of Tsujita et al. (33Tsujita T. Brockman H.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8423-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). During the adsorption assay, the surface tension was measured by the Wilhelmy method using a Cahn Model 27 microbalance from which was suspended a 24-gauge diameter nichrome wire (35Momsen W.E. Smaby J.M. Brockman H.L. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1990; 135: 547-552Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The aqueous subphase (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.6, 0.1m NaCl) was contained in a circular Teflon trough 5.6 cm in diameter. Temperature control was achieved by mounting the trough on a thermostated base plate. Positioning of the microbalance and the Wilhelmy wire were controlled by a microprocessor-controlled stepper motor. Stirring of the circular aqueous compartment was precisely controlled at 60 rpm to minimize surface disturbance. Lipid dissolution and protein adsorption measurements were performed at 24 °C in an atmosphere of humidified argon. The argon-buffer interface was cleaned by compression and aspiration, reducing the volume of the subphase to 24.4 ml. Sixteen μl of 1,2-diolein dissolved in petroleum ether was spread slowly over the cleaned aqueous surface to give a final surface pressure reading of 25 mN/m. The solvent was allowed to evaporate, and 12 μl of subphase buffer containing 3–4 μCi of [32P]phosphate was introduced into the subphase by a microsyringe. An aliquot of [3H]DFP-labeled enzyme was added to the subphase after 1 min. When the surface pressure increase reached the maximum, the Wilhelmy wire was removed, and the lipid film was collected by a hydrophobic filter paper (36Momsen W.E. Brockman H.L. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 292-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The filter paper was air-dried and cut into pieces for liquid scintillation counting. A 1-ml aliquot of the subphase was also collected to determine the amount of the subphase carried over onto the filter. The amount of enzyme adsorbed was determined by subtracting the amount of subphase carryover from the amount of enzyme bound on the filter paper. The wild type and the R63A- and R423G-mutagenized CEL expressed by recombinant adenovirus-infected 293a cells were isolated by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography using the procedure previously established for the isolation of CEL from recombinant Baculovirus-infected insect cells (29DiPersio L.P. Kissel J.A. Hui D.Y. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A notable difference was that this procedure did not result in purified CEL from the adenovirus expression system (Fig.1). However, purified protein with >90% homogeneity could be obtained by an additional gel filtration step with a Sephacryl 200 fast performance liquid chromatography column (Fig. 2). No difference in column elution profile was observed between the wild type and either mutant forms of CEL (data not shown).Figure 2Gel filtration chromatography of recombinant CEL. Fractions eluted from the heparin-Sepharose column that contained CEL immunoreactivity were pooled, concentrated, and then applied to a Sephacryl 200 fast performance liquid chromatography column that had previously been equilibrated with buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.6, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.5% glycerol. The sample was eluted in the same buffer and collected in 1-ml fractions. The protein profile was monitored based on absorbance at 280 nm (●). An aliquot of each fraction was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with anti-rat CEL. The inset shows the Coomassie Blue staining of the gel. Fractions 25–31 contained a single protein band and displayed significant anti-CEL immunoreactivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The purified wild type and mutagenized recombinant CEL were characterized based on the bile salt-dependent hydrolysis of cholesteryl [14C]oleate and the bile salt-independent hydrolysis of [14C]palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine. The results showed that mutations of either Arg63 or Arg423abolished most of the cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity of CEL (Fig. 3). Analysis of the enzyme kinetics data revealed that the major difference between the mutants and the wild type enzyme was the k cat value for cholesteryl oleate hydrolysis, with the R63A and R423G CEL displaying 5- and 11-fold lower k cat than that of the native wild type enzyme, respectively (TableII). No significant difference in the Km value for cholesteryl ester hydrolysis was observed between the wild type and the R63A and R423G mutant enzymes (Table II).Table IIEnzyme kinetics of wild type and mutagenized CELCholesteryl ester hydrolysisLysophospholipid hydrolysisKmkcatKmkcatμmpmol/min-ngμmpmol/min-ngWild type10.68 ± 2.476.78 ± 0.7667.3 ± 17.30.031 ± 0.002R63A8.35 ± 1.291.32 ± 0.092-aSignificant difference from wild type control CEL atp < 0.05.213.0 ± 69.72-aSignificant difference from wild type control CEL atp < 0.05.0.199 ± 0.0272-aSignificant difference from wild type control CEL atp < 0.05.R423G8.88 ± 4.310.53 ± 0.122-aSignificant difference from wild type control CEL atp < 0.05.19.2 ± 3.22-aSignificant difference from wild type control CEL atp < 0.05.0.068 ± 0.0022-aSignificant difference from wild type control CEL atp < 0.05.Cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity of purified recombinant CEL, the R63A mutant, or R423G mutant enzymes was measured based on the hydrolysis of cholesteryl [14C]oleate to [14C]oleate in the presence of 14.5 mmtaurocholate. Lysophospholipase activity was determined based on the hydrolysis of 1-[14C]palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine to [14C]palmitate. The results represent triplicate determinations from five different experiments.2-a Significant difference from wild type control CEL atp < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity of purified recombinant CEL, the R63A mutant, or R423G mutant enzymes was measured based on the hydrolysis of cholesteryl [14C]oleate to [14C]oleate in the presence of 14.5 mmtaurocholate. Lysophospholipase activity was determined based on the hydrolysis of 1-[14C]palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine to [14C]palmitate. The results represent triplicate determinations from five different experiments. In contrast to the results of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis, the bile salt-independent lysophospholipase activity of CEL was found to be enhanced by mutagenesis of the arginine residues in positions 63 and 423 to alanine and glycine, respectively (Fig.4). The R63A mutant CEL displayed a 6.5-fold increase in k cat value for lysophosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, whereas the k cat value for the R423G mutant was 2-fold higher than that for the wild type recombinant CEL (Table II). The two mutant CEL also differed from wild type CEL in Kmvalues for their lysophospholipase activity with the R63A mutant displaying a 6-fold increase, whereas the R423G mutant had a 3-fold decrease in Km (Table II). A well established characteristic of bile salt-CEL interaction is bile salt protection of the enzyme against thermal inactivation. Therefore, this unique property was evaluated with the R63A- and R423G-mutagenized CEL to assess the possible involvement of these residues in bile salt interaction. The results revealed that the cholesteryl oleate hydrolytic activity of wild type CEL as well as the residual enzyme activity of the R63A and R423G mutant enzymes were abolished after 10–20 min of incubation at 50 °C in the absence of bile salt. The presence of 14.5 mm taurocholate in the incubation mixture significantly reduced thermal inactivation of the wild type CEL, with 80% of the cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity remaining after 1 h of incubation at 50 °C (Fig. 5). Taurocholate also protected the R63A mutant CEL against thermal inactivation, albeit not to the same extent as that for the wild type enzyme, with approximately 50% of the original enzyme activity remaining after 1 h of incubation at 50 °C (Fig. 5). In contrast, the presence of bile salt did not confer protection on the R423G mutant CEL against thermal inactivation, with total loss of enzyme activity after 20 min of incubation at 50 °C (Fig. 5). In addition to stimulation of cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity, primary bile salt has also been shown to induce conformational changes in CEL (31Jacobson P.W. Wiesenfeld P.W. Gallo L.L. Tate R.L. Osborne Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 515-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in bile salt protection against thermal inactivation of the R63A and R423G mutant CEL suggested that these mutations may have altered the conformation of CEL in the presence and/or the absence of bile salt. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was performed to test these possibilities. The results showed that the mutagenized CEL displayed similar spectra as the wild type CEL when measurements were made in the absence of bile salt (Fig.6 A). Consistent with the circular dichroism data of CEL purified from rat pancreas (31Jacobson P.W. Wiesenfeld P.W. Gallo L.L. Tate R.L. Osborne Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 515-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all three recombinant proteins showed negative transitions at 220 and 210 nm and positive maximum at 200 nm (Fig. 6 A). These results indicated the high α-helical content of all three proteins. When the circular dichroism spectra were measured in the presence of 10 μm taurocholate, increases in the mean residue ellipticity values were observed for wild type and R63A- and R423G-mutagenized CEL (Fig. 6, B–D). The impact of R63A and R423G mutations on CEL binding to lipid substrates was evaluated by comparing their adsorption to monolayers of 1,2-diolein at the argon-buffer interface. For these experiments, the enzymes were inactivated by radiolabeling with [3H]diisofluorophosphate to prevent hydrolysis of the lipid film. The amount of enzyme adsorbed to the lipid monolayer was quantitated based on the amount of radiolabeled enzyme bound to the monolayer when surface pressure of the lipid film reached equilibrium. The results showed that the surface pressure changes were similar with wild type and both mutant forms of CEL (data not shown). However, mutations in either Arg63 or Arg423 significantly reduced the maximum amount of CEL adsorbed to the lipid interface by 5- to 8-fold (Fig.7). Results of two separate binding isotherm data showed that wild type CEL and the R63A and R423G mutant proteins bound to 1,2-diolein films with averageB max values of 7.87, 1.28, and 1.46 pmol/cm2, respectively. Previous studies using a chemical modification approach have shown that the modification of arginine residues in CEL abolished its interaction with bile salt (25Lombardo D. Campese D. Multigner L. LaFont H. DeCaro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Blackberg L. Hernell O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Computer modeling analysis of the CEL structure, based on the structure of Salmon carboxylester lipase, suggested the possible participation of Arg63 and Arg423 in this process (26Gjellesvik D.R. Lorens J.B. Male R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the x-ray crystal structure of bovine CEL-taurocholate complex failed to show the involvement of arginine residues in CEL-bile salt interaction (22Wang X. Wang C.S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, this study was undertaken to further examine the role of Arg63 and Arg423 in the structure and function of CEL. Our results showed that mutagenesis of arginine residues 63 and 423 to alanine and glycine, respectively, significantly reduced the bile salt-stimulated cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity in CEL. The R63A and R423G mutant enzymes not only retained bile salt-independent lysophospholipid hydrolytic activity, but their activity against this substrate was actually higher than that observed for the wild type CEL. These data indicated that the mutations did not result in alteration of the active site domain. More importantly, the results suggested that the arginine residues at positions 63 and 423 are important in modulating bile salt-activated cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity of CEL. The precise mechanism by which Arg63 and Arg423participate in modulating the bile salt-activated enzyme activity in CEL is unknown at this time. However, our current data indicate that they do not participate directly in interaction with monomeric bile salt. This conclusion is based on the observation of similar circular dichroism spectra for wild type, R63A, and R423G CEL, and that all three proteins displayed similar spectral changes upon the addition of 10 μm taurocholate. This bile salt-induced change in circular dichroism spectra is a characteristic of monomeric bile salt binding to specific sites on CEL (31Jacobson P.W. Wiesenfeld P.W. Gallo L.L. Tate R.L. Osborne Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 515-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is more likely that the decrease in hydrolytic activity against cholesteryl esters in bile salt micelles is due to alterations in the positive-charged domain(s) necessary for CEL interaction with negatively charged micelles carrying the cholesteryl ester substrate. This hypothesis is consistent with the crystal structure data obtained by Wang et al. (22Wang X. Wang C.S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which showed that Arg63 and Arg423 are key residues forming the two parallel rows of positive-charged residues near the active site domain of CEL. Our data also showed that, despite significant reduction in cholesteryl ester hydrolytic activity, the R63A and R423G mutant CEL actually displayed increased hydrolytic activity against water-soluble substrates such as lysophosphatidylcholine. A possible explanation for this observation is that the mutations induced subtle changes in protein conformation near the active site groove and that this conformational change favors active site accessibility by water-soluble substrates such as lysophosphatidylcholine. A close examination of the location of these residues in the architecture of CEL is consistent with this hypothesis. Coordinates of the bovine CEL have shown a closed structure for CEL in the absence of bile salt, with the C terminus (residues 575–579) lodged in the active site of the protein (23Chen J.C.H. Miercke L.J.W. Krucinski J. Starr J.R. Saenz G. Wang X. Spilburg C.A. Lange L.G. Ellsworth J.L. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5107-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although the electron density of the lid (residues 113–119) was not apparent in the crystal structure, the missing amino acids could be built into the closed structure by isolating them from the open crystal structure with bile salt (22Wang X. Wang C.S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and then attaching them to the corresponding amino acids in the closed structure. The modeled lid was then energy-minimized as a subset using the SYBYL program. This model revealed that Arg63 is hydrogen-bonded to Ser121 (Lys121 in the rat sequence) and the neighboring Met111 forms a hydrogen bond with the C terminus holding the lid in place and covering the C terminus (Fig.8). Bile salt binding to the loop domain of CEL would disrupt the hydrogen bonding interaction between Arg63 and Ser121 (Lys121 in the rat sequence), causing the loop to peel back and the C terminus to be freed from the active site (Fig. 8). This allows substrate accessibility to the hydrophobic pocket erstwhile occupied by the C terminus. The mutation of Arg63 to Ala63 would cause similar changes in the CEL structure, disrupting hydrogen bonding between residues 63 and 121, and freeing the C terminus from the active site domain. Likewise, Arg423 is also located in close proximity to the active site groove, and its mutation to a neutral amino acid residue would abolish hydrogen bonding patterns resulting in peeling back of the loop domain and freeing the C terminus from the active site domain. The participation of Arg63 and Arg423 in intramolecular hydrogen bonding of CEL is supported indirectly by additional experimental evidence presented in the current study. First, both R63A and R423G mutant enzymes were more susceptible to heat inactivation in comparison with the native wild type CEL. Second, less R63A and R423G mutant proteins than wild type CEL were found to be adsorbed to the diolein monolayer even though comparable changes in surface pressure were observed at equilibrium. The first set of results suggested that less energy is required for denaturation of the R63A and R423G mutants compared with the wild type CEL. The latter results further indicated that both mutant enzymes assumed a more relaxed conformation in the lipid film, suggestive of increased surface denaturation of the mutant enzymes. The increased sensitivity to interfacial inactivation of the R63A and R423G mutant enzymes in comparison with the wild type CEL may also explain their inefficiency in cholesteryl ester hydrolysis. In summary, the current study resolves some of the discrepancies in the literature regarding the involvement of arginine residues in bile salt binding to CEL. Our results are consistent with the x-ray crystallography data, which showed no arginine residues near the bile salt binding site (22Wang X. Wang C.S. Tang J. Dyda F. Zhang X.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1209-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The data are also consistent with chemical modification results (25Lombardo D. Campese D. Multigner L. LaFont H. DeCaro A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37Blackberg L. Hernell O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), showing that modifications of arginines, particularly those at residues 63 and 423, indirectly inhibited bile salt activation of the enzyme toward cholesteryl ester hydrolysis. This inhibition is related to the decrease of positive charges necessary for CEL interaction with the negatively charged micelles and/or the increased sensitivity of enzyme denaturation at the lipid surface. Surprisingly, these mutations actually increased lysophospholipase activity of CEL, probably due to disruption of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and increasing the accessibility of the active site domain to this water-soluble substrate."

Although a variety of naturally occurring mutations have been identified in patient alleles, few have been well characterized. We have explored the functional significance of a common patient mutation, F171S, using a strategy of conservative substitution at the defined residue followed by expression of the wild-type and, alternatively, substituted proteins in a null-background strain of yeast. As expected from patient studies, the F171S-hGALT protein demonstrated <0.1% wild-type levels of activity, although two of three conservatively substituted moieties, F171L- and F171Y-hGALT, demonstrated ∼10% and ∼4% activity, respectively. The third protein, F171W, demonstrated severely reduced abundance, precluding further study. Detailed kinetic analyses of purified wild-type, F171L- and F171Y-hGALT enzymes, coupled with homology modeling of these proteins, enabled us to suggest that the effects of these substitutions resulted largely from altering the position of a catalytically important residue, Gln-188, and secondarily, by altering the subunit interface and perturbing hexose binding to the uridylylated enzyme. These results not only provide insight into the functional impact of a single common patient allele and offer a paradigm for similar studies of other clinically or biochemically important residues, but they further help to elucidate activity of the wild-type human GALT enzyme.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Impairment of human GALT (hGALT) results in the potentially lethal disorder galactosemia (2Segal S. Berry G. Scriver C. Beaudet A. Sly W. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. 1. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 967-1000Google Scholar). Studies of hGALT alleles derived from patients with galactosemia have revealed extraordinary allelic heterogeneity in this disorder; the number of candidate mutations identified now exceeds 150, the majority of which are missense point mutations (3Tyfield L. Reichardt J. Fridovich-Keil J. Croke D.T. Elsas L.J. Strobl W. Kozak L. Coskun T. Novelli G. Okano Y. Zekanowski C. Shion Y. Boleda M.D. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Indeed, many if not most galactosemia patients studied are compound heterozygotes. Unfortunately, although many patient alleles have now been sequenced, few of the substitutions identified are well understood in terms of their impact on hGALT structure and/or function. Considering the marked variability of clinical outcome for patients with galactosemia (4Waggoner D.D. Buist N.R.M. Donnell G.N. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1990; 13: 802-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and the possibility that allelic heterogeneity may account for at least some fraction of this phenotypic variability, understanding the functional consequence of specific patient mutations is an issue of clinical as well as basic importance. One of the most significant challenges to understanding the functional impact of patient mutations is not determining whether a given substitution in hGALT impairs activity, but why? No structure of the human enzyme is currently available, but extensive studies have been done with the highly homologous Escherichia coli enzyme (5Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11049-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I.

Both the bacterial and human enzymes catalyze a double displacement reaction following classical ping-pong kinetics. The E. coli enzyme is uridylylated on the His-166 (His-186 in human), and this intermediate is catalytically competent (24Geeganage S. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14500-14507Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A step other than uridyl transfer is rate-limiting, possibly product release. In addition to these mechanistic studies, structural work has demonstrated that the substrate binding site is composed of residues from both subunits in the active dimer (7Thoden J.B. Ruzicka F.J. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Homology modeling of the human GALT sequence onto the availableE. coli GALT crystal structure (5Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11049-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) should allow some predictions to be made regarding patient alleles, but if activity of a mutant protein is fully impaired, the possibilities for testing these predictions are limited. One approach to address experimentally the impact of a “severe” naturally occurring substitution on hGALT function is to make and characterize more conservative substitutions at the same position. By carefully selecting the amino acids to be substituted, the importance of side chain properties such as charge, shape, aromaticity, or polarity can be tested. By studying the residual activity associated with these conservatively substituted hGALT proteins, a clearer image of the functional requirements of the natural residue may be inferred. By extension, the functional impact of the non-conservative patient mutation at that site also may be deduced. Thus, this approach is expected to yield insights into the specific role(s) of individual residues in the enzyme. We have utilized this approach of directed conservative substitutions to investigate the functional significance of the patient-derived F171S allele of human GALT. F171S was selected for study for three reasons. First, like many patient alleles, F171S-hGALT has been associated with a complete loss of activity in patient hemolysates (8Wang B.T. Xu Y.K. Ng W.G. Wong L.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 63: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Wang B.T. Xu Y.K. Wong L.J. Kaufman F.R. Williams J.I. Ng W.G. Am. J. Hum. Gen. 1996; 59 (suppl.) (abstr.): 292Google Scholar) and with little if any activity in a COS cell expression system (10Reichardt J.K.V. Levy H.L. Woo S.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5430-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Second, Phe-171 in hGALT is predicted by homology modeling with the E. coli GALT crystal structure to participate in interactions with at least one and possibly both substrates of the enzyme (5Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11049-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6Wedekind J.E. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11560-11569Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 7Thoden J.B. Ruzicka F.J. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This prediction raises the intriguing possibility that F171S-hGALT may not function in patient cells because the substitution impairs interaction of the enzyme with UDP-glu and/or with gal-1-P. Finally, the F171S substitution accounts for approximately 4% of the African-American galactosemia patient alleles studied (8Wang B.T. Xu Y.K. Ng W.G. Wong L.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1998; 63: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 9Wang B.T. Xu Y.K. Wong L.J. Kaufman F.R. Williams J.I. Ng W.G. Am. J. Hum. Gen. 1996; 59 (suppl.) (abstr.): 292Google Scholar), making it one of the more common naturally occurring mutations detected in a given ethnic group. By probing the functional requirements of Phe-171 in the experiments described here, we have attempted both to define further the nature of substrate binding and catalysis in wild-type human GALT and to shed light on the functional consequence of one important patient mutation. We report here the construction, expression, and kinetic analyses of wild-type and F171S human GALT as well as three alternatively substituted alleles: F171L-, F171Y-, and F171W-hGALT. All five human proteins were expressed and studied using a previously described yeast expression system (11Fridovich-Keil J.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that position 171 is important in determining both catalytic efficiency and the ratio of Km/Kia for UDP-glu. Homology modeling suggests that the effects are modulated by interactions with Gln-188, another important active site residue that is often mutated in classic galactosemia (3Tyfield L. Reichardt J. Fridovich-Keil J. Croke D.T. Elsas L.J. Strobl W. Kozak L. Coskun T. Novelli G. Okano Y. Zekanowski C. Shion Y. Boleda M.D. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 13: 417-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and/or with two loops on the other subunit involved in binding UDP-hexose. Each substitution at position 171 can result in a repositioning of the side chain of Gln-188 and the binding loops containing residues 50–60 and 335–340 from the other subunit in the dimer. These putative rearrangements fully explain the effects of the substitutions tested. All substitutions at codon 171 in human GALT were created by site-directed mutagenesis of the otherwise wild-type sequence in an M13mp19 vector using a mutagenic oligonucleotide degenerate at the last 2 positions of codon 171 (12Quimby B.B. Wells L. Wilkinson K.D. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26835-26842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Specific substitutions were determined by sequence analysis of individual clones resulting from the mutagenesis procedure. The clones selected for further study carried the following sequences at codon 171: TCG (Ser, S), TTG (Leu, L), TAT (Tyr, Y), and TGG (Trp, W). Fragments of hGALT sequence containing these substitutions were then subcloned using BglII and NcoI into the corresponding sites in a vector encoding wild-type hGALT. To facilitate isolation of these proteins, we also constructed plasmids encoding proteins with hexahistidine tags at their amino termini (12Quimby B.B. Wells L. Wilkinson K.D. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26835-26842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All experiments described here involved expression of either tagged or untagged GALT proteins, as indicated, from the strong constitutive yeast GAP promoter in the context of the 2-μm (high copy number) plasmid YEP-GAP (generous gift of Dr. Warren Kruger, Fox Chase Cancer Center). All yeast manipulations were performed according to standard techniques, as described previously (13Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology.in: Guthrie C. Fink G. Methods in Enzymology. 194. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). All YEP-GAP-derivative plasmids were transformed into yJFK1, a haploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficient in GAL7, the endogenous yeast GALT (11Fridovich-Keil J.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected and maintained on the basis of tryptophan prototrophy, conferred by the plasmid. Before harvest, cells were cultured in medium containing dextrose as the sole carbon source rather than galactose to prevent any selective pressure on the cells caused by the expressed human transferase protein. Before lysis, cultures were harvested atA 600 ∼ 2. Extracts were prepared from 30-ml (small) and 6-liter (large) cultures essentially as described previously (11Fridovich-Keil J.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Quimby B.B. Wells L. Wilkinson K.D. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26835-26842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from small cultures were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and transferred to 2-ml tubes. Acid-washed glass beads (500 μl of 0.5 mm) were then added to each tube, and the cells were disrupted by 6 cycles of agitation (45 s on high speed followed by 45 s on ice) in a multihead Vortex mixer at 4 °C. Each disrupted cell suspension was then transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet insoluble material. Finally, the clarified supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube, and the protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent and bovine serum albumin as a standard as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells from 6-liter cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 × g (4 °C) for 10 min and were resuspended in 150 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.88 μg/ml E-64, 0.44 μg/ml phosphoramidon, 0.2 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.625 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The cell suspension was then transferred to a Biospec products bead beater with about 150 ml of pre-chilled, acid-washed 0.5-mm glass beads. The suspension was agitated at 4 °C for four cycles of 1 min at high speed alternating with 4 min on ice. The disrupted cell suspension was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Finally, the clarified supernatant was stored until use at −85 °C. Protein concentration was determined as described above. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (14Fridovich-Keil J.L. Quimby B.B. Wells L. Mazur L.A. Elsevier J.P. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1995; 56: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In all cases, 1 μg of total protein was loaded onto each lane of the gel. Both wild-type and mutant forms of human GALT protein were detected using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (EU70) raised against hexahistidine-tagged human GALT at a dilution of 1:100,000. Parallel blots probed with a mouse polyclonal antiserum also directed against hGALT produced indistinguishable results (data not shown). As a control for comparable loading of lanes, all blots also were probed simultaneously with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (at 1:20,000 dilution) directed against endogenous yeast cyclophilin (15Zydowsky L.D. Ho S.I. Baker C.H. McIntyre K. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Signals were visualized using secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1:5000 dilution) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the ECL system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, as recommended by the manufacturer. GALT activity was determined in lysates of yeast expressing native and hexahistidine-tagged forms of the hGALT protein (11Fridovich-Keil J.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Quimby B.B. Wells L. Wilkinson K.D. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26835-26842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in quadruplicate (or greater) under initial rate conditions. For extracts containing wild-type hGALT, 0.1 μg and 0.5 μg of total protein were used per assay. Assays of extracts containing the substituted F171L and F171Y-hGALT proteins were performed using 3 μg and 6 μg of protein per assay to compensate for the impaired activities of these enzymes. Similarly, assays of extracts containing the substituted F171W- and F171S-hGALT proteins were performed using between 100 to 300 μg of protein per assay. Hexahistidine-tagged forms of wild-type and F171L- and F171Y-hGALT were purified to near homogeneity for further kinetic analysis. Purifications were performed using Hi-Trap-chelating columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), essentially as recommended by the manufacturer. In brief, each column was rinsed with water, charged with Ni2+, and then washed with a start buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5m NaCl) containing 25 mm imidazole. For each 1 ml of Hi-Trap chelating column, 10 ml of crude lysate were filtered using a 0.2-μm syringe filter and then passed over the column. The column was then washed in a stepwise manner with 2 × 2 ml each of (a) 25 mm imidazole in phosphate buffer, (b) 50 mm imidazole in phosphate buffer, (c) 75 mm imidazole in phosphate buffer, and (d) 100 mm imidazole in phosphate buffer. The bound hGALT protein was then eluted using 250 mm imidazole in phosphate buffer. When 5-ml columns were used, all volumes were increased by a factor of five. Following isolation, each purified protein preparation was then passed over a Hi-Trap desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove the imidazole. Protease inhibitors (0.625 μg/ml leupeptin, 3.6 μg/ml E-64, 0.55 μg/ml phosphoramidon, 0.5 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.625 μg/ml pepstatin, 1.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 0.5 μmβ-mercaptoethanol were added to each sample, and the protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein reagent. Purified wild-type hGALT was stable to freezing and so was often stored in 50% glycerol in liquid nitrogen until needed. Unfortunately, neither substituted hGALT protein (F171Y and F171L) was stable under these conditions, so both were always used fresh the same day that they were purified. SDS-PAGE gels were fixed in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 10 min, rinsed with water, and then stained with gentle rocking overnight in 40 ml of staining stock (1.17 mm Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 0.8 mammonium sulfate, 0.1 m phosphoric acid) plus 10 ml methanol (16Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar). After staining, gels were washed repeatedly with water until the background was clear and then fixed for 10 min in a solution of 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 1% glycerol. Finally, gels were air-dried between sheets of cellulose acetate and stored at room temperature. Kinetic assays were carried out using a coupled, spectrophotometric assay as described previously (12Quimby B.B. Wells L. Wilkinson K.D. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26835-26842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7166-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The assay buffer contained 100 mm glycyl-glycine, pH 8.7, 6 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μmglucose-1,6-diphosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm NADP, 0.1 μg of phosphoglucomutase, and 0.06 μg of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in a total reaction volume of 400 μl. For assays of wild-type hGALT activity, 300 ng of protein were used per reaction. Thirty assays were then performed in triplicate, with UDP-glu varying from 0.025 mm to 1.6 mmand with gal-1-P varying from 0.075 mm to 1.2 mm. For assays of F171Y-hGALT, 3000 ng of purified protein were used per reaction, and activity was determined in triplicate with UDP-glu varying from 0.2 mm to 6.4 mm and gal-1-P varying from 0.3 mm to 4.8 mm. Finally, for F171L-hGALT, 3000 ng of purified protein were used per reaction, with UDP-glu varying from 0.0625 mm to 5 mm and gal-1-P varying from 0.6 mm to 9.6 mm. Negative control assays were routinely performed, leaving out one or both substrates or leaving out the enzyme. The expected negative result always was obtained. Values of Km of UDP-glu,Km of gal-1-P, V max,Kia of UDP-glu and KIb of gal-1-P were determined for each hGALT enzyme tested. Briefly, the data for each enzyme were fitted to Equation 1 using a Microsoft Excel® spreadsheet programmed to perform a non-linear least squares fit.v=VmKa[A]1+[B]Kib+Kb[A]Kia[B]+1+Kb[B]Equation 1 The estimates were further refined by fixing the invariant constants determined above and allowing the others to vary using the program MacCurve Fit (Kevin Ranier Software, Victoria, Australia). The goodness-of-fit was evaluated by calculating the correlation coefficient r 2 for each concentration of gal-1-P. In all cases, suitable fits were obtained using this model, and the kinetic constants did not vary significantly upon refinement. These constants are shown in Table I.Table IKinetic constants for the wild-type and mutant enzymesWild typeF171LF171YKa (mmUDP-glu)0.60.90.3Kia(mm UDP-glu)0.20.1>20Kb (mmgal-1-P)0.40.40.8Kib(mm gal-1-P)>20>20>20k cat (s−1)989.33.6r 2 (average ± S.D.)0.92 ± 0.030.95 ± 0.020.79 ± 0.03Data were fit to Equation 1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The correlation coefficient (r 2) was calculated for the fits to each concentration of gal-1-P, and the average of the five fits is given here.

The effects of mutation were examined by homology modeling the human sequence onto the published structure of the uridylylated E. coli enzyme (7Thoden J.B. Ruzicka F.J. Frey P.A. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The human sequence was submitted to the Swiss-Model automated protein modeler server. The resultant model showed that all the residues that make contact with the uridyl group were identical in the human and E. coliprotein, and the human residues could be accommodated in positions similar to those observed in the E. coli crystal structure. Therefore, the coordinates of the E. coli enzyme were used with the program SwissPDBViewer. The desired mutations were modeled using the MUTATE module of the program, and the optimal rotamers were selected such that steric clashes were minimized, and hydrogen bonds were maximized. The “best” rotomer was that with the lowest score = (4 × number of clashes with backbone N, Cα, and C atoms) + (3 × number of clashes with backbone O atoms) + (2 × number of clashes with side-chain atoms) − (number of hydrogen bonds) − (4 × number of disulfide bonds). In all cases, the rotamer selected had the β carbon of the mutated residue in the same position as the β carbon of Phe-171. Next, the side chain of Gln-188 was allowed to adopt all the common rotamer conformations, and the optimal rotamer was again selected. Finally, the side chain of each residue was manually rotated to allow any hydrogen bonds to form without introducing any steric clashes. The final adjustments leading to the structures shown in Fig. 4 were obtained with less than 20°s of rotation in all cases. The details of the algorithms used are further described at the SwissProt web site. Hydrogen bonds are automatically indicated and are shown in Fig. 4. We have used site-directed mutagenesis of the otherwise wild-type hGALT sequence to recreate the naturally occurring substitution F171S as well as each of three more conservative substitutions at the same position: F171L, F171Y, and F171W. The substitution F171L was selected to preserve hydrophobicity while changing size and aromaticity, F171Y was selected to preserve aromaticity and size while changing hydrophobicity, and F171W was selected to preserve hydrophobicity and aromaticity while changing size. To facilitate the eventual rapid purification of each protein, all five sequences also were engineered to carry a hexahistidine tag at the amino terminus. We have utilized this tag previously on the amino terminus of hGALT and demonstrated that it does not impair either expression or activity of the fusion protein (17Elsevier J.P. Wells L. Quimby B.B. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7166-7171Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All five hGALT sequences, with and without hexahistidine tags, were introduced into a previously described null-background strain of S. cerevisiae, yJFK1 (11Fridovich-Keil J.L. Jinks-Robertson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), in the context of the yeast expression plasmid, YEP-GAP, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cultures were maintained in glucose-containing medium to avoid possible complications from growth under selective pressure for GALT (i.e. medium containing galactose). Crude soluble extracts from each culture were analyzed to determine both abundance and activity of each substituted hGALT protein. As illustrated in Fig. 1, both tagged and untagged (native) forms of wild-type and F171S, F171L, and F171Y-hGALT proteins were abundant in these lysates; F171W-hGALT, in both tagged and native forms, was greatly decreased relative to the others. To control for comparable loading of lanes, filters were probed simultaneously with rabbit polyclonal antisera against both human GALT and the endogenous yeast protein, cyclophilin (15Zydowsky L.D. Ho S.I. Baker C.H. McIntyre K. Walsh C.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because only soluble proteins were included in the preparations subjected to Western blot analysis in Fig. 1, the formal possibility remained that F171W-hGALT might be expressed at levels comparable with the other hGALT proteins, but that unlike the others, it preferentially partitioned to the insoluble fraction. To test this possibility, fresh cultures of yeast expressing each of the relevant hGALT proteins were grown, harvested, and prepared as before, except that both supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Although some variability was seen from sample to sample, likely reflecting differential cell lysis efficiencies, the ratio of hGALT signals observed in supernatants and their corresponding pellets was not substantially different for any of the cultures tested (data not shown). Differential solubility of the various substituted hGALT proteins in yeast is therefore an unlikely explanation for the differential expression levels observed. As expected, the wild-type protein was highly active under standard assay conditions, and the patient-derived F171S-hGALT was completely inactive (<0.1% wild-type activity). Of the three more conservative substitutions, F171L and F171Y demonstrated partial activity above background (Fig. 1). Whether the lack of detectable hGALT activity in extracts of cells expressing the F171W allele reflected catalytic impairment or diminished abundance of that substituted protein, or both, remains unclear. Nonetheless, substantial residual activity was retained by at least two conservative substitutions at the Phe-171 position, enabling further studies of those substituted enzymes and their catalytic properties relative to wild-type hGALT. To facilitate comparative kinetic studies of the wild-type and F171L- and F171Y-hGALT enzymes, all three proteins were purified to near homogeneity by nickel affinity chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.2 presents colloidal Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles of representative samples of all three proteins, both as crude (C) and purified (P) fractions. Kinetic studies involving each purified protein were conducted at several concentrations of each substrate. The wild-type enzyme is subject to inhibition by excess substrate"
