https://openalex.org/W3114428384,"Objective We determined the effectiveness of a multi-strain probiotic (Hexbio ® ) containing microbial cell preparation MCP ® BCMC ® on constipation symptoms and gut motility in PD patients with constipation. Methods PD patients with constipation (ROME III criteria) were randomized to receive a multi-strain probiotic ( Lactobacillus sp and Bifidobacterium sp at 30 X 10 9 CFU) with fructo-oligosaccaride or placebo (fermented milk) twice daily for 8 weeks. Primary outcomes were changes in the presence of constipation symptoms using 9 items of Garrigues Questionnaire (GQ), which included an item on bowel opening frequency. Secondary outcomes were gut transit time (GTT), quality of life (PDQ39-SI), motor (MDS-UPDRS) and non-motor symptoms (NMSS). Results Of 55 recruited, 48 patients completed the study: 22 received probiotic and 26 received placebo. At 8 weeks, there was a significantly higher mean weekly BOF in the probiotic group compared to placebo [SD 4.18 (1.44) vs SD 2.81(1.06); (mean difference 1.37, 95% CI 0.68, 2.07, uncorrected p &lt;0.001)]. Patients in the probiotic group reported five times higher odds (odds ratio = 5.48, 95% CI 1.57, 19.12, uncorrected p = 0.008) for having higher BOF (&lt; 3 to 3–5 to &gt;5 times/week) compared to the placebo group. The GTT in the probiotic group [77.32 (SD55.35) hours] reduced significantly compared to placebo [113.54 (SD 61.54) hours]; mean difference -36.22, 95% CI -68.90, -3.54, uncorrected p = 0.030). The mean change in GTT was 58.04 (SD59.04) hour vs 20.73 (SD60.48) hours respectively (mean difference 37.32, 95% CI 4.00, 70.63, uncorrected p = 0.028). No between-groups differences were observed in the NMSS, PDQ39-SI, MDS-UPDRS II and MDS-UPDRS III scores. Four patients in the probiotics group experienced mild reversible side effects. Conclusion This study showed that consumption of a multi-strain probiotic (Hexbio ® ) over 8 weeks improved bowel opening frequency and whole gut transit time in PD patients with constipation."
https://openalex.org/W3116919906,"Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in China in December 2019 and has spread around the world. High Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in COVID-19 patients suggest that a cytokine storm may play a major role in the pathophysiology and are considered as a relevant parameter in predicting most severe course of disease. The aim of this study was to assess repeated IL-6 levels in critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and to evaluate their relationship with patient’s severity and outcome. Methods We conducted a retrospective study on patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 10 (i.e. the date of the first admitted patients) and April 30, 2020. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected at admission. On the day of IL-6 blood concentration measurement, we also collected results of D-Dimers, C-Reactive Protein, white blood cells and lymphocytes count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin as well as microbiological samples, whenever present. Results Of a total of 65 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our ICU we included 41 patients with repeated measure of IL-6. There was a significant difference in IL-6 levels between survivors and non-survivors over time (p = 0.001); moreover, non survivors had a significantly higher IL-6 maximal value when compared to survivors (720 [349–2116] vs. 336 [195–646] pg/mL, p = 0.01). The IL-6 maximal value had a significant predictive value of ICU mortality (AUROC 0.73 [95% CI 0.57–0.89]; p = 0.01). Conclusions Repeated measurements of IL-6 can help clinicians in identifying critically ill COVID-19 patients with the highest risk of poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3113778354,"We conducted a rapid, mixed-methods assessment to understand how COVID-19 affected Latinx sexual minority men (LSMM) and transgender women (LTGW). Using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing software, one interviewer called 52 participants (randomly sampled from a larger HIV prevention pilot study aiming to increase HIV knowledge and testing frequency; n = 36 LSMM and n = 16 LTGW) between 04/27/20-05/18/20. We quantified core domains using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory scale and provided important context through open-ended qualitative questions assessing: 1) COVID-19 infection history and experiences with quarantine; 2) Health and healthcare access; 3) Employment and economic impact of COVID-19. Participants reported increases in physical conflict or verbal arguments with a partner (13.5%) or other adult(s) (19.2%) due to stressors associated with the safer-at-home order. Participants also reported increased alcohol consumption (23.1%), problems with sleep (67.3%) and mental health (78.4%). Further, disruptions in access to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis or PrEP-a daily pill to prevent HIV-occurred (33.3% of 18 participants who reported being on PrEP). Many said they received less medical attention than usual (34.6%), and LTGW reported delays in critical gender-affirming hormones/procedures. Half of the participants lost their jobs (50.0%); many undocumented participants relayed additional financial concerns because they did not qualify for financial assistance. Though no COVID-19 infections were noted, COVID-19 dramatically impacted other aspects of health and overall wellbeing of LSMM and LTGW. Public health responses should address the stressors faced by LSMM and LTGW during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W3116377789,"The Chinese citrus fly, Bactrocera minax , is a notorious univoltine pest that causes damage to citrus. B . minax enters obligatory pupal diapause in each generation to resist harsh environmental conditions in winter. Despite the enormous efforts that have been made in the past decade, the understanding of pupal diapause of B . minax is currently still fragmentary. In this study, the 20-hydroxyecdysone solution and ethanol solvent was injected into newly-formed pupae to obtain non-diapause- (ND) and diapause-destined (D) pupae, respectively, and a comparative proteomics analysis between ND and D pupae was performed 1 and 15 d after injection. A total of 3,255 proteins were identified, of which 190 and 463 were found to be differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in ND1 vs D1 and ND15 vs D15 comparisons, respectively. The reliability and accuracy of LFQ method was validated by qRT-PCR. Functional analyses of DAPs, including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, were conducted. The results revealed that the diapause program of B . minax is closely associated with several physiological activities, such as phosphorylation, chitin biosynthesis, autophagy, signaling pathways, endocytosis, skeletal muscle formation, protein metabolism, and core metabolic pathways of carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid conversion. The findings of this study provide insights into diapause program of B . minax and lay a basis for further investigation into its underlying molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3116678444,"Background Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation may be used as a potential bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), or as a ceiling-of-care for persistent hypoxaemia despite standard oxygen therapy, according to UK guidelines. We examined the association of mode of respiratory support and ceiling-of-care on mortality. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of routinely collected de-identified data of adults with nasal/throat SARs-CoV-2 swab-positive results, at the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust between 10th March-19th April 2020 (outcomes determined on 22nd May). Findings Of 347 patients with SARs-CoV-2 swab-positive results, 294 (84.7%) patients admitted for Covid-19 were included in the study. Sixty-nine patients were trialled on CPAP, mostly delivered by face mask, either as an early ceiling of care instituted within 24 hours of admission (N = 19), or as a potential bridge to IMV (N = 44). Patients receiving a ceiling of care more than 24 hours after admission (N = 6) were excluded from the analysis. Two hundred and fifteen patients (73.1%) maximally received air/standard oxygen therapy, and 45 (15.3%) patients maximally received CPAP. Thirty-four patients (11.6%) required IMV, of which 24 had received prior CPAP. There were 138 patients with an early ceiling-of-care plan (pre-admission/within 24h). Overall, 103(35.0%) patients died and 191(65.0%) were alive at study end. Among all patients trialled on CPAP either as a potential bridge to IMV (N = 44) or as a ceiling-of-care (N = 19) mortality was 25% and 84%, respectively. Overall, there was strong evidence for higher mortality among patients who required CPAP or IMV, compared to those who required only air/oxygen (aOR 5.24 95%CI: 1.38, 19.81 and aOR 46.47 95%CI: 7.52, 287.08, respectively; p&lt;0.001), and among patients with early ceiling-of-care compared to those without a ceiling (aOR 41.81 95%CI: 8.28, 211.17; p&lt;0.001). Among patients without a ceiling of care (N = 137), 10 patients required prompt intubation following failed oxygen therapy, but 44 patients received CPAP. CPAP failure, defined as death (N = 1) or intubation (N = 24), occurred in 57% (N = 25) of patients. But in total, 75% (N = 33) of those started on CPAP with no ceiling of care recovered to discharge—19 without the need for IMV, and 14 following IMV. Conclusion Our data suggest that among patients with no ceiling-of-care, an initial trial of CPAP as a potential bridge to IMV offers a favourable therapeutic alternative to early intubation. In contrast, among patients with a ceiling-of care, CPAP seems to offer little additional survival benefit beyond oxygen therapy alone. Information on ceilings of respiratory support is vital to interpreting mortality from Covid-19. Strengths and limitations of this study Sample size relatively small. Study sample representative of hospitalised Covid-19 patients in UK. Previously unreported data on role of ceilings-of-care in hospitalised Covid-19 patients. Novel data on use of CPAP separated by indication."
https://openalex.org/W3114789349,"The COVID-19 pandemic is currently spreading widely around the world, causing huge threats to public safety and global society. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, reveals China’s epicenters of the pandemic through spatial clustering, and delineates the substantial effect of distance to Wuhan on the pandemic spread. The results show that the daily new COVID-19 cases mostly occurred in and around Wuhan before March 6, and then moved to the Grand Bay Area (Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Macau). The total COVID-19 cases in China were mainly distributed in the east of the Huhuanyong Line, where the epicenters accounted for more than 60% of the country’s total in/on 24 January and 7 February, half in/on 31 January, and more than 70% from 14 February. The total cases finally stabilized at approximately 84,000, and the inflection point for Wuhan was on 14 February, one week later than those of Hubei (outside Wuhan) and China (outside Hubei). The generalized additive model-based analysis shows that population density and distance to provincial cities were significantly associated with the total number of the cases, while distances to prefecture cities and intercity traffic stations, and population inflow from Wuhan after 24 January, had no strong relationships with the total number of cases. The results and findings should provide valuable insights for understanding the changes in the COVID-19 transmission as well as implications for controlling the global COVID-19 pandemic spread."
https://openalex.org/W3117245402,"Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) Krast, commonly known as “Lingzhi” in Chinese, is a medicinal mushroom that is rich in biologically active substances. Polysaccharides and triterpenoids are the two major components responsible for the bioactivity of this fungus. In the present study, the ultrasonic-assisted co-extraction (UACE) of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from G . lucidum was optimized using response surface methodology with a desirability function, with the equal importance for the two components. Following single factor experiments, the optimal conditions were determine as ultrasonic power of 210 W, extraction temperature of 80C, ratio of liquid to solid of 50 mL/g, and 100 min extraction time, using aqueous ethanol (50%, v/v) as the extracting solvent. Under the optimal conditions, the extraction yields of polysaccharides and triterpenoids reached 0.63% and 0.38%, respectively. On the basis of the scavenging capacity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and evaluation of reducing power, the antioxidant capacities of the polysaccharides obtained by optimal UACE process were higher than those of polysaccharides extracted using traditional hot water extraction, whereas the triterpenoid-rich extracts showed antioxidant activities similar to those obtained using the ethanol maceration method. The present study is the first report on the simultaneous extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from G . lucidum . The developed UACE process could be useful in preparation of a polysaccharide- and triterpenoid-rich ingredient that holds great promise for application in the Ganoderma industry."
https://openalex.org/W3114303552,"It is believed that the approximate estimation of large sets and the exact quantification of small sets (subitizing) are supported by two different systems, the Approximate Number System (ANS) and Object Tracking System (OTS), respectively. It is a current matter of debate whether they are both impaired in developmental dyscalculia (DD), a specific learning disability in symbolic number processing and calculation. Here we tackled this question by asking 32 DD children and 32 controls to perform a series of tasks on visually presented sets, including exact enumeration of small sets as well as comparison of large, uncountable sets. In children with DD, we found poor sensitivity in processing large numerosities, but we failed to find impairments in the exact enumeration of sets within the subitizing range. We also observed deficits in visual short-term memory skills in children with dyscalculia that, however, did not account for their low ANS acuity. Taken together, these results point to a dissociation between quantification skills in dyscalculia, they highlight a link between DD and low ANS acuity and provide support for the notion that DD is a multifaceted disability that covers multiple cognitive skills."
https://openalex.org/W3114965763,"Dendritic cells are sentinels of the immune system and represent a key cell in the activation of the adaptive immune response. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α)–a crucial oxygen sensor stabilized during hypoxic conditions–has been shown to have both activating and inhibitory effects in immune cells in a context- and cell-dependent manner. Previous studies have demonstrated that in some immune cell types, HIF-1α serves a pro-inflammatory role. Genetic deletion of HIF-1α in macrophages has been reported to reduce their pro-inflammatory function. In contrast, loss of HIF-1α enhanced the pro-inflammatory activity of dendritic cells in a bacterial infection model. In this study, we aimed to further clarify the effects of HIF-1α in dendritic cells. Constitutive expression of HIF-1α resulted in diminished immunostimulatory capacity of dendritic cells in vivo , while conditional deletion of HIF-1α in dendritic cells enhanced their ability to induce a cytotoxic T cell response. HIF-1α-expressing dendritic cells demonstrated increased production of inhibitory mediators including IL-10, iNOS and VEGF, which correlated with their reduced capacity to drive effector CD8 + T cell function. Altogether, these data reveal that HIF-1α can promote the anti-inflammatory functions of dendritic cells and provides insight into dysfunctional immune responses in the context of HIF-1α activation."
https://openalex.org/W3115208038,"This study explored familiarity with, attitudes toward, uptake and discontinuation of PrEP (Pre-exposure prophylaxis) among a national probability sample of gay and bisexual men. PrEP is one of the most effective biomedical HIV prevention strategies; however, use among gay and bisexual men remains low within the United States. This study used a national probability sample of gay and bisexual men from three age cohorts of men (18–25, 34–41, and 52–59 years at wave 1) who completed three annual surveys between March 2016 and March 2018 (N at wave 1 = 624). Recruitment occurred through a Gallup dual-frame sampling procedure; results for this study came from eligible individuals who consented to be part of the self-administered online or mailed survey questionnaire. We used descriptive data with sampling weights to understand trends in PrEP familiarity, PrEP attitudes and PrEP use across all three time points. Next, PrEP uptake and discontinuation were assessed among men completing all three surveys and who remained eligible for PrEP at all three time points (N = 181). PrEP familiarity increased considerably between 2016 and 2018 among those eligible for PrEP (from 59.8% from wave 1 to 92.0% at wave 3). Favorable attitudes toward PrEP increased more modestly (from 68.3% at wave 1 to 72.7% at wave 3). While PrEP use increased by 90% between the two time points (from 4.1% in 2016 to 7.8% in 2018), this represented a small percentage of overall uptake among eligible participants across time (6.6%). Among respondents who reported PrEP use at wave 1 or wave 2, 33.3% subsequently discontinued PrEP use at a later wave. Findings indicate modest increases in PrEP use between 2016 and 2018 in a national probability sample of sexually-active gay and bisexual men. PrEP discontinuation was high and suggests the need for further research into gay and bisexual men’s PrEP discontinuation and persistence."
https://openalex.org/W3116462324,"Background Fish oil supplements that are rich in omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs). PUFAs are among the most widely-used dietary supplements globally, and millions of people consume them regularly. There have always been public concerns that these products should be guaranteed to be safe and of good quality, especially as these types of fish oil supplements are extremely susceptible to oxidative degradation. Objectives The aim of the current study is to investigate and examine the oxidation status of dietary supplements containing fish oils and to identify important factors related to the oxidation status of such supplements available in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods A total of 44 fish oil supplements were analysed in this study. For each product, the oxidative parameters peroxide value (PV), anisidine value (AV), and total oxidation (TOTOX) were calculated, and comparisons were made with the guidelines supplied by the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s (GOED). Median values for each of the above oxidative parameters were tested using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. P values &lt; 0.05 were chosen as the statistically significant boundary. Results The estimate for the average PV value was 6.4 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) [4.2–8.7] compared to the maximum allowable limit of 5 meq/kg. The estimate for the average P-AV was 11 with a 95% CI [7.8–14.2] compared to the maximum allowable limit of 20. The estimate for the average TOTOX value was 23.8 meq/kg with a 95% CI [17.4–30.3] compared to the maximum allowable limit of 26 according to the GOED standards. Conclusion This research shows that most, although not all, of the fish oil supplements tested are compliant with the GOED oxidative quality standards. Nevertheless, it is clear that there should be a high level of inspection and control regarding authenticity, purity, quality, and safety in the processes of production and supply of dietary supplements containing fish oils."
https://openalex.org/W3117204056,"Diabetes is one of the most common comorbidities in adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to analyze the mortality risk factors of diabetic patients with COVID-19. A total of 167 patients with severe COVID-19, including 55 diabetic patients and 112 nondiabetic patients at Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China from January 28, 2020, to March 10, 2020, were collected. The laboratory, radiological, management information, and medical history was retrospectively reviewed. Potential mortality risk factors in diabetic patients with COVID-19 were evaluated by the proportional hazard Cox model. The clinical information of 167 patients with severe COVID-19 was analyzed. The median age was 65.0 years. Approximately 32.9% of patients had diabetes. In total patients, older age, diabetes, and lymphocyte count were associated with increased risk of death. In diabetic patients, increased mortality was associated with decreased lymphocyte count (≤0.45×10⁹/L, HR 0.196, 95% CI 0.049–0.781, P = 0.021), lactate dehydrogenase &gt;600 U/L (HR 8.010, 95% CI 1.540–41.670, P = 0.013), hsCRP &gt;90 mg/L (HR 4.551, 95% CI 1.472–14.070, P = 0.009) and interleukin-10 &gt;10 U/mL (HR 5.362, 95% CI 1.239–23.199, P = 0.025). COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a poor prognosis, especially when they had two or more of the following abnormalities (χ2 = 58.62, P &lt;0.001): lymphocyte count was ≤0.45×10⁹/L, lactate dehydrogenase was &gt;600 U/L, hsCRP was &gt;90 mg/L and IL-10 was &gt;10 U/mL. For diabetic patients with COVID-19, more attention should be paid to the dynamic monitoring of cytokine levels, and the control of hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W3114597212,"Introduction Little is known about the outcomes of subjects with a history of severe acute malnutrition (SAM). We therefore sought to explore the long-term effects of SAM during childhood on human capital in adulthood in terms of education, cognition, self-esteem and health-related disabilities in daily living. Methodology We traced 524 adults (median age of 22) in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, who were treated for SAM during childhood at Lwiro hospital between 1988 and 2007 (median age 41 months). We compared them with 407 community controls of comparable age and sex. Our outcomes of interest were education, cognitive function [assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) for literate participants, or its modified version created by Ertan et al. (MMSE-I) for uneducated participants], self-esteem (measured using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale) and health-related social and functional disabilities measured using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS). For comparison, we used the Chi-squared test along with the Student’s t-test for the proportions and means respectively. Results Compared with the community controls, malnutrition survivors had a lower probability of attaining a high level of education (p &lt; 0.001), of reporting a high academic performance (p = 0.014) or of having high self-esteem (p = 0.003). In addition, malnutrition survivors had an overall mean score in the cognitive test that was lower compared with the community controls [25.6 compared with 27.8, p = 0.001 (MMSE) and 22.8 compared with 26.3, p &lt; 0.001(MMSE-I)] and a lower proportion of subjects with a normal result in this test (78.0% compared with 90.1%, p &lt; 0.001). Lastly, in terms of health-related disabilities, unlike the community controls, malnutrition survivors had less social disability (p = 0.034), but no difference was observed as regards activities of daily living (p = 0.322). Conclusion SAM during childhood exposes survivors to low human capital as regards education, cognition and behaviour in adulthood. Policy-deciders seeking to promote economic growth and to address various psychological and medico-social disorders must take into consideration the fact that appropriate investment in child health as regards SAM is an essential means to achieve this."
https://openalex.org/W3116547201,"Mental health literacy (MHL) is key for mental health development, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC) where mental health resources are limited. MHL development can be thought of as occurring at two levels: the individual person level (via direct contact, with specifically-targeted individuals), and the public health level (via indirect contact through public media, targeting the general public). Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.The present mixed methods study assessed the status of and best approaches for development of mental health literacy in the Southeast Asian LMIC Vietnam. Because there has been relatively little discussion of MHL development at the public health level, this assessment focused on the public health level, although not exclusively. Because mental health professionals generally have the most in-depth understanding of their mental health system, study participants were 82 Vietnamese mental health professionals who completed a quantitative survey, with 48 participating in focus groups.Most of the professionals viewed MHL in Vietnam as low or very low, and that it was difficult or very difficult for the general public to find effective mental health services. Main barriers underlying these problems and more generally for developing MHL in Vietnam identified in the focus groups were: (a) misinformation in the media regarding mental health and mental illness; (b) lack of licensure for non-medical mental health professionals (e.g., psychologists; social workers); (c) lack of interest in mental health from upper-level leadership.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing professionals' perceptions regarding mental health literacy at both the public health and individual-person levels. Although sampling was restricted to Vietnamese professionals, results may provide initial preliminary guidance for other LMIC considering mental health literacy development at multiple levels."
https://openalex.org/W3118094932,"Accurate determination of physical/mass and electron densities are critical to accurate spatial and dosimetric delivery of radiotherapy for photon and charged particles. In this manuscript, the biology, chemistry, and physics that underly the relationship between computed tomography (CT) Hounsfield Unit (HU), mass density, and electron density was explored. In standard radiation physics practice, quantities such as mass and electron density are typically calculated based off a single kilovoltage CT (kVCT) scan assuming a one-to-one relationship between HU and density. It is shown that, in absence of mass density assumptions on tissues, the relationship between HU and density is not one-to-one with uncertainties as large as 7%. To mitigate this uncertainty, a novel multi-dimensional theoretical approach is defined between molecular (water, lipid, protein, and mineral) composition, HU, mass density, and electron density. Empirical parameters defining this relationship are x-ray beam energy/spectrum dependent and, in this study, two methods are proposed to solve for them including through a tissue mimicking phantom calibration process. As a proof of concept, this methodology was implemented in a separate in-house created tissue mimicking phantom and it is shown that sub 1% accuracy is possible for both mass and electron density. As molecular composition is not always known, the sensitivity of this model to uncertainties in molecular composition was investigated and it was found that, for soft tissue, sub 1% accuracy is achievable assuming nominal organ/tissue compositions. For boney tissues, the uncertainty in mineral content may lead to larger errors in mass and electron density compared with soft tissue. In this manuscript, a novel methodology to directly determine mass and electron density based off CT HU and knowledge of molecular compositions is presented. If used in conjunction with a methodology to determine molecular compositions, mass and electron density can be accurately calculated from CT HU."
https://openalex.org/W3117649377,"The HIV treatment cascade is an effective tool to track progress and gaps in the HIV response among key populations. People who inject drugs (PWID) remain the most affected key population in Ukraine with HIV prevalence of 22% in 2015. We performed secondary analysis of the 2017 Integrated Bio-Behavioral Surveillance (IBBS) survey data to construct the HIV treatment cascade for PWID and identify correlates of each indicator achievement. The biggest gap in the cascade was found in the first “90”, HIV status awareness: only 58% [95% CI: 56%-61%] of HIV-positive PWID reported being aware of their HIV-positive status. Almost 70% [67%-72%] of all HIV-infected PWID who were aware of their status reported that they currently received antiretroviral therapy (ART). Almost three quarters (74% [71%-77%]) of all HIV-infected PWID on ART were virally suppressed. Access to harm reduction services in the past 12 months and lifetime receipt of opioid agonist treatment (OAT) had the strongest association with HIV status awareness. Additionally, OAT patients who were aware of HIV-positive status had 1.7 [1.2–2.3] times the odds of receiving ART. Being on ART for the last 6 months or longer increased odds to be virally suppressed; in contrast, missed recent doses of ART significantly decreased the odds of suppression. The HIV treatment cascade analysis for PWID in Ukraine revealed substantial gaps at each step and identified factors contributing to achievement of the outcomes. More intensive harm reduction outreach along with targeted case finding could help to fill the HIV awareness gap among PWID in Ukraine. Scale up of OAT and community-level linkage to care and ART adherence interventions are viable strategies to improve ART coverage and viral suppression among PWID."

The prevalence of STEC in heifers (45%) was significantly higher than in lactating cows (16%) ( p &lt;0.05, Fisher exact test statistic value is &lt;0.00001). A total of 133 STEC were isolated, 24 (13.8%) carried Shiga-toxin 1 ( stx1 ) genes, 69 (39.7%) carried Shiga-toxin 2 ( stx2 ) genes, and 40 (23%) carried both stx1 and stx2 . Intimin ( eae ) virulence gene was detected in 29 (21.8%) of the isolates. STEC isolates belonged to 72 different O:H serotypes, comprising 40 O serogroups and 23 H types. The most frequent serotypes were O29:H12 (15%) and O113:H21 (5.2%), found in a large number of farms. Two isolates belonged to the highly virulent serotypes associated with human disease O157:H7 and O26:H11. Many other bovine STEC serotypes founded in this work belonged to serotypes previously described as pathogenic to humans. Thus, this study highlights the need for control strategies that can reduce STEC prevalence at the farm level and, thus, prevent food and environmental contamination."
https://openalex.org/W3117038099,"Background Nut consumption has been associated with reduced inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. However, the influence on the prevalence and severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has yet to be evaluated. Methods 4655 subjects were included as part of a colorectal carcinoma screening program (SAKKOPI) between 07/2010 and 07/2019 and analyzed 2020. Patients were characterized using biochemical and metabolic parameters, as well as a detailed questionnaire on dietary habits. The diagnosis of NAFLD was established using abdominal ultrasound. Consumption of nuts was graded as: no consumption or &lt;1 time/week, 1–6 times/week, 1 time/day and ≥2 times/day. Results Mean age was 58.5±9.8years with a mean BMI of 26.5±4.7kg/m 2 . 2058 (44.2%) patients suffered from the metabolic syndrome, 2407 (51.6%) had arterial hypertension, 2287 (49.1%) showed prediabetes/diabetes, 1854 (39.4%) had dyslipidemia and 1984 patients (43.5%) were diagnosed with NAFLD. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome (1219 [48.7%] vs. 605 [40.2%] vs. 189 [37.4%] vs. 45 [31.7%], p&lt;0.001) and NALFD (1184 [48.1%] vs. 594 [40.7%] vs. 158 [31.7%] vs. 48 [34.0%], p&lt;0.001). On multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders and dietary patterns, nut consumption ≥1time/day was inversely associated with NAFLD in the overall cohort (adjusted Odds ratio[aOR]: 0.719 [95%CI:0.558–0.926], p = 0.011). However, following subgroup analysis, this inverse association was only confirmed in male patients (aOR: 0.589 [95%CI: 0.411–0.844], p = 0.004) but not in females (aOR: 0.886 [95%CI: 0.616–1.275], p = 0.515). Moreover, patients who consumed nuts 1–6 times/week had a significantly lower prevalence of advanced fibrosis (Fib-4 score &gt;2.67: aOR: 0.551 [95%CI: 0.338–0.898], p = 0.017; Forns-Index &gt;6.9: aOR: 0.585 [95%CI: 0.402–0.850], p = 0.005). Conclusions Nut consumption might exert beneficial effects on the prevalence of NAFLD in males. The negative association with advanced fibrosis warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3117359262,"The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of time of day (TD) on two types of exercise protocols [continuous (CP) versus alternated (AP)]. Eleven physical education students (mean ± SD: age = 24.4 ± 1.2 years, aerobic peak power (APP) = 290 ± 31.9 W) underwent four sessions. These sessions were performed at 08:00 (AM) and 18:00 (PM) and consisted of cycling exercises until voluntary exhaustion at 90% APP (CP) or 70%-105% APP (AP) with the order of testing randomly assigned. Time to exhaustion (time limit = Tlim) was measured from the start of the test to when voluntary exhaustion occurred. Heart rate (HR) was recorded at baseline (HRbaseline) and throughout the protocols to determine HR at exhaustion (HRpeak). Blood lactate ([La]) was measured at rest, immediately after exhaustion and at 2min30 post-exercise to determine [La]peak. A significantly higher means of Tlim (334 ± 57 s; 272 ± 59 s; p&lt; 0.05), HRbaseline (72 ± 5 beats/min; 67 ± 5 beats/min; p&lt; 0.01), HRpeak (186 ± 8 beats/min; 178 ± 9 beats/min; p&lt; 0.01) and [La]peak (16.2 ± 2.1 mmol/l; 13.9 ± 1.9 mmol/l; p&lt; 0.05) were observed in CP at the PM compared to the AM. In addition, a significant higher means of Tlim (380 ± 54 s; 312 ± 82 s; p&lt; 0.05), HRbaseline (73.1 ± 5.5 beats/min; 67 ± 5.4 beats/min; p&lt; 0.01), HRpeak (186 ± 8 beats/min; 180 ± 9 beats/min; p&lt; 0.05) and [La]peak (17.9 ± 1.8 mmol/l; 14.7 ± 2.1 mmol/l; p&lt; 0.01) were observed in AP at the PM compared to the AM. It is concluded that AP and CP are more appropriate in the late afternoon than in the morning for performing long-lasting exercises. The AP could be a novel strategy for increasing the engagement in physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W3117736128,"Research on face sensitivity is of particular relevance during the rapidly evolving Covid-19 pandemic leading to social isolation, but also calling for intact interaction and sharing. Humans possess high sensitivity even to a coarse face scheme, seeing faces in non-face images where real faces do not exist. The advantage of non-face images is that single components do not trigger face processing. Here by implementing a novel set of Face-n-Thing images, we examined (i) how face tuning alters with changing display orientation, and (ii) whether it is affected by observers’ gender. Young females and males were presented with a set of Face-n-Thing images either with canonical upright orientation or inverted 180° in the image plane. Face impression was substantially impeded by display inversion. Furthermore, whereas with upright display orientation, no gender differences were found, with inversion, Face-n-Thing images elicited face impression in females significantly more often. The outcome sheds light on the origins of the face inversion effect in general. Moreover, the findings open a way for examination of face sensitivity and underwriting brain networks in neuropsychiatric conditions related to the current pandemic (such as depression and anxiety), most of which are gender/sex-specific."
https://openalex.org/W3116101990,"Background Appropriate complementary feeding has the potential to prevent 6 percent of all under five deaths particularly in developing countries. However, infant and young child feeding practices in Ethiopia are suboptimal. Data on complementary feeding practices in Horro district are also lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to determine magnitude and determinants of appropriate complementary feeding practice among mothers of children age 6–23 months in Horro district, Western Ethiopia. Methods Community based cross sectional study was conducted from February to March 2016 in six kebeles of Horro district, Western Ethiopia. A total of 325 mothers of children age 6–23 months were included in the study. Data were collected using pre-tested interviewer administered structured questionnaire; entered into EPI-INFO version 3.5.4 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Odds ratio was calculated with 95% CI to identify determinants of appropriate complementary feeding practice. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Results The magnitude of appropriate complementary feeding practice in the study area was 9.91%. Lower age of child (6-11months) [AOR: 0.195, 95% CI: (0.045–0.846)], having no formal education [AOR = 0.115:95% CI: (0.002, 0.290)] and giving birth for the first time [AOR = 0.271:95% CI: (0.011, 0.463)] were factors negatively associated with appropriate complementary feeding practice. Conclusion Only one tenth of mothers practiced appropriate complementary feeding. This strongly calls for sustained nutrition education targeting uneducated mothers, mothers who gave birth for the first time and those with very young children to improve the practice."
https://openalex.org/W3117076345,"Diacerein (DCN), a potent anti-inflammatory API used to treat osteoarthritis yet, it suffers from poor water solubility which affects its oral absorption. Unabsorbed colonic DCN is converted into rhein, which is responsible for laxation as a main side effect of DCN treatment. Therefore, in this study orally disintegrating tablets (ODTs) loaded with optimized DCN solid dispersion system were prepared using different co-processed excipients (Prosolv ® ODT, Pharmaburst ® 500 and F-melt ® ), aiming to achieve improved solubility, rapid absorption and consequently limited amount of rhein reaching the colon. Prepared ODTs were evaluated for physical characteristics, in - vitro drug release, disintegration and wetting times. Dissolution parameters; dissolution efficiency percent at 10 (DE (10 min) %) and 30 (DE (30 min) %) min and mean dissolution time (MDT) were determined. The optimized ODT showed 1.50 and 1.12 fold increase in DE (10 min) % and DE (30 min) %, respectively and 2 fold decrease in MDT, compared to Diacerein ® capsules. In - vivo anti-inflammatory effect of optimized ODT, using rat paw edema revealed significant increase in edema inhibition (p &lt; 0.0465) and promoted onset of action compared to Diacerein ® capsules at 0.5 hr. It could be concluded that optimized ODT could be promising for enhanced dissolution and rapid absorption of DCN from the oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W3116692193,"Although emotion regulation has been proposed to be crucial for empathy, investigations on emotion regulation have been primarily limited to intrapersonal processes, leaving the interpersonal processes of self-regulation rather unexplored. Moreover, studies showed that emotion regulation and empathy are related with increased autonomic activation. How emotion regulation and empathy are related at the autonomic level, and more specifically during differently valenced social situations remains an open question. Healthy adults viewed a series of short videos illustrating a target who was expressing positive, negative, or no emotions during a social situation (Positive, Negative, or Neutral Social Scenes). Prior to each video, participants were instructed to reappraise their own emotions (Up-regulation, Down-regulation, or No-regulation). To assess autonomic activation, RR intervals (RRI), high frequency (HF) components of heart rate variability (HRV), and electrodermal activity phasic responses (EDRs) were calculated. Situational empathy was measured through a visual analogue scale. Participants rated how empathic they felt for a specific target. Up- and Down-regulation were related to an increase and a decrease in situational empathy and an increase in RRI and HF, respectively, compared to the control condition (No-regulation). This suggests increased activity of the parasympathetic branch during emotion regulation of situational empathic responses. Positive compared to Negative Social Scenes were associated with decreased situational empathy, in addition to a slightly but non-significantly increased HF. Altogether, this study demonstrates that emotion regulation may be associated with changes in situational empathy and autonomic responses, preferentially dominated by the parasympathetic branch and possibly reflecting an increase of regulatory processes. Furthermore, the current study provides evidence that empathy for different emotional valences is associated with distinct changes in situational empathy and autonomic responses."
https://openalex.org/W3116783035,"The respiratory system is a central part of voice production as it contributes to the generation of subglottic pressure, which has an impact on voice parameters including fundamental frequency and sound pressure level. Both parameters need to be adjusted precisely during complex phonation tasks such as singing. In particular, the underlying functions of the diaphragm and rib cage in relation to the phonation of pitch jumps are not yet understood in detail. This study aims to analyse respiratory movements during phonation of pitch jumps using dynamic MRI of the lungs. Dynamic images of the breathing apparatus of 7 professional singers were acquired in the supine position during phonation of upwards and downwards pitch jumps in a high, medium, and low range of the singer’s tessitura. Distances between characteristic anatomical landmarks in the lung were measured from the series of images obtained. During sustained phonation, the diaphragm elevates, and the rib cage is lowered in a monotonic manner. During downward pitch jumps the diaphragm suddenly changed its movement direction and presented with a short inspiratory activation which was predominant in the posterior part and was associated with a shift of the cupola in an anterior direction. The magnitude of this inspiratory movement was greater for jumps that started at higher compared to lower fundamental frequency. In contrast, expiratory movement of the rib cage and anterior diaphragm were simultaneous and continued constantly during the jump. The data underline the theory of a regulation of subglottic pressure via a sudden diaphragm contraction during phonation of pitch jumps downwards, while the rib cage is not involved in short term adaptations. This strengthens the idea of a differentiated control of rib cage and diaphragm as different functional units during singing phonation."
https://openalex.org/W3113837602,"Objectives To compare virologic and immunologic outcomes of integrase inhibitor (INSTI)-containing, contemporary boosted protease inhibitor (PI/b)-containing and non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-containing regimens in a real-life setting. Methods Using logistic regression, virologic and immunologic outcomes of INSTI use were compared to outcomes of PI/b or NNRTI treatment 12 months after treatment start or switch, for participants in the RESPOND cohort consortium. A composite treatment outcome (cTO) was used, defining success as viral load (VL) &lt;200 copies/mL and failure as at least one of: VL ≥200 copies/mL, unknown VL in the time window, any changes of antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, AIDS, or death. In addition, on-treatment analysis including only individuals with known VL and no regimen changes was performed. Favorable immunologic response was defined as a 25% increase in CD4 count or as reaching ≥750 CD4 cells/μL. Results Between January 2012 and January 2019, 13,703 (33.0% ART-naïve) individuals were included, of whom 7,147 started/switched to a regimen with an INSTI, 3,102 to a PI/b and 3,454 to an NNRTI-containing regimen. The main reason for cTO failure in all treatment groups were changes in ART regimen. Compared to INSTIs, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of cTO success was significantly lower for PI/b (0.74 [95% confidence interval, CI 0.67–0.82], p &lt;0.001), but similar for NNRTIs (1.07 [CI 0.97–1.17], p = 0.11). On-treatment analysis and sensitivity analyses using a VL cut-off of 50 copies/mL were consistent. Compared to INSTIs, the aORs of a 25% increase in CD4 count were lower for NNRTIs (0.80 [CI 0.71–0.91], p&lt;0.001) and PI/b (0.87 [CI 0.76–0.99], p = 0.04). Conclusion In this large analysis of a real-world population, cTO and on-treatment success were similar between INSTIs and NNRTIs, but lower for PI/b, though residual confounding cannot be fully excluded. Obtaining favorable immunologic outcomes were more likely for INSTIs than the other drug classes."
https://openalex.org/W3117840536,"Objectives To study Group B Streptococcus (GBS) isolates associated with different clinical syndromes: asymptomatic carriage in pregnant women, intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), and early onset disease (EOD) in the newborn. Methods GBS isolates were collected from asymptomatic pregnant women admitted for labor, IUFD cases, and neonates with EOD. Serotypes and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed to assess genetic epidemiology. Results GBS carriage rate was 26.1% (280/1074). The dominant serotype among asymptomatic pregnant women was VI [98/240 women (40.8%)], followed by serotypes III, V and IV in 42/240 (17.5%), 30/240 (12.5%) and 28/240 (11.7%) women, respectively. The dominant serotype in IUFD cases was serotype VI [10/13 (76.9%)]. In contrast the prevalent serotype among EOD cases was III [16/19 (84.2%)]. ST-1 was associated with IUFD [7/13 (53.8%)], ST-17 was associated with serotype III and EOD in the newborn 14/19 (73.7%)]. Erythromycin and clindamycin resistance reached 36.8%, 7.7% and 20.0%among EOD, vaginal carriage and IUFD, respectively. Conclusions Serotypes VI and ST-1 were dominant among asymptomatic pregnant women and in IUFD cases while EOD was associated with serotype III and ST-17. Invasive mechanisms thus may differ between IUFD and EOD in the newborn and virulence may be related to capsule serotype. Resistance rates to erythromycin and clindamycin were high in EOD cases."
https://openalex.org/W3114071328,"We developed a novel dual-energy (DE) virtual monochromatic (VM) very-deep super-resolution (VDSR) method with an unsharp masking reconstruction algorithm (DE–VM–VDSR) that uses projection data to improve the nodule contrast and reduce ripple artifacts during chest digital tomosynthesis (DT). For estimating the residual errors from high-resolution and multiscale VM images from the projection space, the DE–VM–VDSR algorithm employs a training network (mini-batch stochastic gradient-descent algorithm with momentum) and a hybrid super-resolution (SR) image [simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART) total-variation (TV) first-iterative shrinkage–thresholding algorithm (FISTA); SART–TV–FISTA] that involves subjective reconstruction with bilateral filtering (BF) [DE–VM–VDSR with BF]. DE-DT imaging was accomplished by pulsed X-ray exposures rapidly switched between low (60 kV, 37 projection) and high (120 kV, 37 projection) tube-potential kVp by employing a 40° swing angle. This was followed by comparison of images obtained employing the conventional polychromatic filtered backprojection (FBP), SART, SART–TV–FISTA, and DE–VM–SART–TV–FISTA algorithms. The improvements in contrast, ripple artifacts, and resolution were compared using the signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR), Gumbel distribution of the largest variations, radial modulation transfer function (radial MTF) for a chest phantom with simulated ground-glass opacity (GGO) nodules, and noise power spectrum (NPS) for uniform water phantom. The novel DE–VM–VDSR with BF improved the overall performance in terms of SDNR (DE–VM–VDSR with BF: 0.1603, without BF: 0.1517; FBP: 0.0521; SART: 0.0645; SART–TV–FISTA: 0.0984; and DE–VM–SART–TV–FISTA: 0.1004), obtained a Gumbel distribution that yielded good images showing the type of simulated GGO nodules used in the chest phantom, and reduced the ripple artifacts. The NPS of DE–VM–VDSR with BF showed the lowest noise characteristics in the high-frequency region (~0.8 cycles/mm). The DE–VM–VDSR without BF yielded an improved resolution relative to that of the conventional reconstruction algorithms for radial MTF analysis (0.2–0.3 cycles/mm). Finally, based on the overall image quality, DE–VM–VDSR with BF improved the contrast and reduced the high-frequency ripple artifacts and noise."
https://openalex.org/W3115646956,"The pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus associated neurological disorders is still not well understood, yet is known to result in neurological declines despite combination anti-retroviral therapy. HIV-1 transgenic (Tg26) mice contain integrated non-infectious HIV-1 proviral DNA. We sought to assess the integrity of neurocognitive function and sensory systems in HIV-1 Tg26 mice using a longitudinal design, in both sexes, to examine both age- and sex-related disease progression. General neurological reflexive testing showed only acclimation to repeated testing by all groups. Yet, at 2.5 months of age, female Tg26 +/- mice showed hyposensitivity to noxious hot temperatures, compared to wild types (both sexes) and male Tg26 +/- mice, that worsened by 10 months of age. Female Tg26 +/- mice had short-term spatial memory losses in novel object location memory testing at 2.5 and 7 months, compared to female wild types; changes not observed in male counterparts. Female Tg26 +/- mice showed mild learning deficits and short- and long-term spatial memory deficits in olfactory and visually cued Barnes Maze testing at 3 months of age, yet greater learning and memory deficits by 8 months. In contrast, male Tg26 +/- mice displayed no learning deficits and fewer spatial memory deficits (mainly heading errors in nontarget holes). Thus, greater sex-specific temperature hyposensitivity and spatial memory declines were observed in female HIV Tg26 +/- mice, than in male Tg26 +/- mice, or their wild type littermates, that increased with aging. Additionally, tibial bones were examined using ex vivo micro-CT after tissue collection at 11 months. Sex-dependent increases in bone volume and trabecular number were seen in males, matching their greater weights at this age. These results indicate that HIV-1 Tg26 mice is a promising model in which to study neuropathic mechanisms underlying peripheral pathology as well as cognitive deficits seen with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W3115925622,"Background Recruitment of individuals with rare diseases for studies of real-world patient-reported outcomes is limited by small base populations. Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of rare, chronic, hematologic malignancies. In this study, recruitment strategies and geographic representativeness from the Living with MPNs survey are reported. Methods The Living with MPNs online cross-sectional survey was conducted between April and November 2016. Individuals 18 to 70 years of age living in the United States and diagnosed with an MPN were eligible to participate. Recruitment approaches included direct contact via emails and postcards; posts on MPN-focused social media and patient advocacy websites; postcard mailings to doctors’ offices; and advertisements on medical websites, Google, and Facebook. Geographic representativeness was assessed based on the number of survey respondents living in each state or the District of Columbia and by the number of survey respondents per 10 million residents. Results A total of 904 respondents with MPNs completed the survey. The recruitment method yielding the greatest number of respondents was advertisements on MPN-focused social media (47.6% of respondents), followed by emails (35.1%) and postcards (13.9%) sent through MPN advocacy groups. Home state information was provided by 775 respondents from 46 states (range of respondents per state, 1–89). The number of respondents per 10 million residents in the 46 states with respondents ranged from 12.1 to 52.7. Conclusions Recruitment using social media and communications through patient groups and advocacy organizations are effective in obtaining geographically representative samples of individuals with MPNs in the United States. These approaches may also be effective in other rare diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3117503688,"Although campaigns promoting organ donation have proved their effectiveness, increasing the number of people who explicitly agree to become donors is still difficult. Based on the social marketing notion of persuasive technology, we reasoned that it was timely to focus on the design of this persuasive technology and to analyze its contribution in particularly challenging contexts such as organ donation. More specifically, the originality of the present study lay in the way we linked the field of persuasive technology to the theory of social representations, and combined them with an analysis of the ergonomic aspects of interface layout. This study had two complementary goals. The first was to determine whether the sociocognitive salience of the central elements of social representations (i.e., the most frequent and important themes related to the subject—here, organ donation—for individuals), can be used to achieve persuasive outcomes. The second was to determine whether interface layout, in terms of information location and background characteristics (color and contrast), can strengthen the persuasive impact. University students ( N &gt; 200) were exposed to a computer screen displaying a message involving either central or peripheral elements of the social representations of organ donation (status), placed either in the middle or on one side of the screen (location), and shown against either a white or a blue background (background). Eye-tracking data were recorded, in addition to self-reported data. In line with the elaboration likelihood model, results showed that participants who were exposed to central (vs. peripheral) elements of the social representations of organ donation followed the central route in processing information. Moreover, they had stronger attitudes, and more of them stated that they were actual organ donors. Importantly, however, at least for some variables, these status-related effects were not independent of the interface layout. More specifically, the persuasive impact of the central elements was enhanced when the information was displayed in the middle (vs. the side) of the screen and when it was displayed on a white (vs. blue) background. We discuss the theoretical and practical issues raised by these results."
https://openalex.org/W3117694299,"Objective The Da Qing Diabetes Prevention program (DQDP) was a randomized lifestyle modification intervention conducted in 1986 for the prevention and control of type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. The current study estimated long-term cost-effectiveness of the program based on the health utilities from the Chinese population. Methods A Markov Monte Carlo model was developed to estimate the impact of the intervention from the healthcare system perspective. The analysis was run over 30-year and lifetime periods and costs were estimated respectively as health management service costs. Baseline characteristics and intervention effects were assessed from the DQDP. Utilities and costs were generated from relevant literature. The outcome measures were program cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the intervention. Sensitivity analyses and threshold analyses were performed. Results Using a 30-year horizon, the intervention strategy was cost-saving and was associated with better health outcomes (increase of 0.74 QALYs per intervention participant). Using a lifetime horizon, the intervention strategy was cost-saving and was associated with additional 1.44 QALYs. Sensitivity analyses showed that the overall ICER was most strongly influenced by the hazard ratio of cardiovascular disease event. Conclusions The Da Qing lifestyle intervention in a Chinese population with impaired glucose tolerance is likely to translate into substantial economic value. It is cost-saving over a 30-year time and lifetime frame."
https://openalex.org/W3114418962,"Aims Creation of an algorithm that includes the most important parameters (history, clinical parameters, and anamnesis) that can be linked to heart failure, helping general practitioners in recognizing heart failure in an early stage and in a better follow-up of the patients. Methods and results The algorithm was created using a consensus-based Delphi panel technique with fifteen general practitioners and seven cardiologists from Belgium. The method comprises three iterations with general statements on diagnosis, referral and treatment, and follow-up. Consensus was obtained for the majority of statements related to diagnosis, referral, and follow-up, whereas a lack of consensus was seen for treatment statements. Based on the statements with good and perfect consensus, an algorithm for general practitioners was assembled, helping them in diagnoses and follow-up of heart failure patients. The diagnosis should be based on three essential pillars, i.e. medical history, anamnesis and clinical examination. In case of suspected heart failure, blood analysis, including the measurement of NT-proBNP levels, can already be performed by the general practitioner followed by referral to the cardiologist who is then responsible for proper diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Afterwards, a multidisciplinary health care process between the cardiologist and the general practitioner is crucial with an important role for the general practitioner who has a key role in the up-titration of heart failure medication, down-titration of the dose of diuretics and to assure drug compliance. Conclusions Based on the consensus levels of statements in a Delphi panel setting, an algorithm is created to help general practitioners in the diagnosis and follow-up of heart failure patients."

Traditional protection methods for electronic systems are facing with serious challenges. Biological nervous system has the self-adaptive advantages under the regulation of the nervous system. It is necessary to explore a new thought on electromagnetic protection by drawing from the self-adaptive advantage of the biological nervous system. In this study, the scale-free spiking neural network (SFSNN) is constructed, in which the Izhikevich neuron model is employed as a node, and the synaptic plasticity model including excitatory and inhibitory synapses is employed as an edge. Under white Gaussian noise, the noise suppression abilities of the SFSNNs with the high average clustering coefficient (ACC) and the SFSNNs with the low ACC are studied comparatively. The noise suppression mechanism of the SFSNN is explored. The experiment results demonstrate that the following. (1) The SFSNN has a certain degree of noise suppression ability, and the SFSNNs with the high ACC have higher noise suppression performance than the SFSNNs with the low ACC. (2) The neural information processing of the SFSNN is the linkage effect of dynamic changes in neuron firing, synaptic weight and topological characteristics. (3) The synaptic plasticity is the intrinsic factor of the noise suppression ability of the SFSNN."
https://openalex.org/W3117388479,"Background Lysosomal Storage Diseases (LSD) are rare and multisytemic diseases which are caused by lysosomal enzyme deficiencies leading into accumulation of waste products due to an interruption in the decomposition process. Due to the low prevalence and therefore limited disease awareness as well as the fact that LSD patients present with unspecific symptoms the final diagnosis is often made after a long delay. The aim of this German-wide survey was to characterize the period between onset of symptoms and final diagnosis regarding e.g. self-perceived health, symptom burden and false diagnoses for patients with selected LSDs (Fabry disease (FD), Gaucher disease (GD) and Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II). Methods The study was conducted as a telephone based cross-sectional survey. All patients living in Germany with a confirmed diagnosis of FD, GD or MPS II were eligible to participate. The questionnaire was provided in advance in order to enable the participants to prepare for the interview. Only descriptive analyses were carried out. Single analyses were not carried out for all three patient groups due low case numbers. Results Of the overall population, 39 patients have been diagnosed with FD, 19 with GD and 11 with MPS II with the majority of patients being index patients. The majority of FD patients reported their current health status as “satisfactory” or better (79.5%). Self-perceived health status was observed to be at least stable or improving for the majority of FD patients compared to the year prior to diagnosis. The most frequently reported symptoms for patients with FD were paraesthesias (51.3%), whereas patients with GD reported a tendency for bleeding, blue spots or coagulation disorder (63.2%) as well as hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly (63.2%) as the most commonly appearing symptoms. The number of patients reporting misdiagnoses was n = 5 (13.5%) for patients with FD and n = 5 (27.8%) for patients with GD. The median duration of the diagnostic delay was 21.0 years for FD, 20.0 years for GD and 2.0 years for MPS II. Conclusions This study showed that self-perceived status of health for patients might improve once the final correct diagnoses has been made and specific treatment was available. Furthermore, it was observed that diagnostic delay is still high in Germany for a relevant proportion of affected patients. Further challenges in the future will still be to increase awareness for these diseases across the entire healthcare sector to minimize the diagnostic delay."
https://openalex.org/W3114563220,"Background Gait disturbances have emerged as some of the main therapeutic concerns in late-stage Parkinson’s disease (PD) treated with dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS). External cues may help to overcome freezing of gait (FOG) and improve some of the gait parameters. Aim To evaluate the effect of 3D visual cues and STN-DBS on gait in PD group. Methods We enrolled 35 PD patients treated with DBS of nucleus subthalamicus (STN-DBS). Twenty-five patients (5 females; mean age 58.9 ±6.3) and 25 sex- and age-matched controls completed the gait examination. The gait in 10 patients deteriorated in OFF state. The severity of PD was evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (HY). The PD group filled the Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES) and Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ). Gait was examined using the GaitRite Analysis System, placed in the middle of the 10m marked path. The PD group was tested without dopaminergic medication with and without visual cueing together with the DBS switched ON and OFF. The setting of DBS was double-blind and performed in random order. Results The UPDRS was 21.9 ±9.5 in DBS ON state and 41.3 ±13.7 in DBS OFF state. HY was 2.5 ±0.6, FES 12.4 ±4.1 and FOGQ 9.4 ±5.7. In the DBS OFF state, PD group walked more slowly with shorter steps, had greater step length variability and longer duration of the double support phase compared to healthy controls. The walking speed and step length increased in the DBS ON state. The double support phase was reduced with 3D visual cueing and DBS; the combination of both cueing and DBS was even more effective. Conclusion Cueing with 3D visual stimuli shortens the double support phase in PD patients treated with DBS-STN. The DBS is more effective in prolonging step length and increasing gait speed. We conclude that 3D visual cueing can improve walking in patients with DBS."
https://openalex.org/W3115046254,"Restriction endonucleases play a central role in the microbial immune system against viruses and are widely used in DNA specific cleavage, which is called restriction digestion, for genetic engineering. Herein, we applied digital cell-free protein synthesis as an easy-to-use orthogonal readout means to assess the restriction digest efficiency, a new application of digital bioassays. The digital counting principle enabled an unprecedentedly sensitive trace analysis of undigested DNA at the single-molecule level in a PCR-free manner. Our approach can quantify the template DNA of much lower concentrations that cannot be detected by ensemble-based methods such as gold-standard DNA electrophoresis techniques. The sensitive and quantitative measurements revealed a considerable variation in the digest efficiency among restriction endonucleases, from less than 70% to more than 99%. Intriguingly, none of them showed truly complete digestion within reasonably long periods of reaction time. The same rationale was extended to a multiplexed assay and applicable to any DNA-degrading or genome-editing enzymes. The enzyme kinetic parameters and the flanking sequence-dependent digest efficiency can also be interrogated with the proposed digital counting method. The absolute number of residual intact DNA molecules per microliter was concluded to be at least 10 7 , drawing attention to the residual issue of genetic materials associated with the interpretation of nucleases’ behaviors and functions in daily genetic engineering experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3117169768,"Objective Current guidelines in British Columbia recommend prenatal screening for hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV) if risk factors are present. We aimed to estimate frequency of prenatal anti-HCV testing, new diagnoses, repeated and follow-up testing among BC women. Methods BC Centre for Disease Control Public Health Laboratory data estimated the number of BC women (assigned female at birth or unknown sex) aged 13–49 who received routine prenatal serological screening (HIV, hepatitis B, syphilis and rubella) from 2008–2019. Anti-HCV tests ordered the same day as routine prenatal screens were considered prenatal anti-HCV tests. Assessment of follow-up was based on HCV RNA and/or genotype testing within one year of new prenatal anti-HCV diagnoses. Results In 2019, 55,202 routine prenatal screens were carried out for 50,392 BC women. Prenatal anti-HCV tests increased significantly, from 19.6% (9,704/49,515) in 2008 to 54.6% (27,516/50,392) in 2019 (p&lt;0.001). New prenatal anti-HCV diagnoses (HCV positive diagnoses at first test or seroconversions) declined from 14.3% in 2008 to 10.1% in 2019. The proportion of women with new prenatal anti-HCV diagnoses that were a result of a first HCV test declined from 0.3% (29/9,701) in 2008 to 0.03% (8/27,500) in 2019. For women known to be anti-HCV positive at the time of prenatal screening, the proportion who had a prenatal anti-HCV test increased from 35.6% in 2008 to 50.8% in 2019. Conclusion Prenatal anti-HCV testing increased substantially over the study period. However, new HCV diagnoses remained relatively stable, suggesting that a considerable proportion of BC women with low or no risk are being screened as part of prenatal care. The vast majority of women with new HCV diagnoses receive appropriate follow-up HCV RNA and genotype testing, which may indicate interest in HCV treatment. These findings contribute to the discussion around potential for prenatal anti-HCV screening in an effort to eliminate HCV."
https://openalex.org/W3117873559,"Purpose The aim is to determine whether serial post-systolic shortening (PSS) using speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) could predict major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), especially symptom-driven infarct-related artery (IRA) revascularization and improvement in segmental function in post-myocardial infarction patients. Methods/Results Ninety-four patients (average age 61.1 ± 12.5 y, 84 [84.9%] male) with new-onset acute myocardial infarction were enrolled. Serial echocardiography was performed during the initial presentation, and at 3, 6 and 12 months after admission. PSS, strain and systolic strain rate were calculated using STE. Improvement in segmental function was defined as a decrease of ≧1 grade in wall motion score. During the follow-up (29.4 ± 12.7months), 22 patients (23.4%) had MACE and 17 patients had symptom-driven IRA revascularization. In multivariate model, PSS at 3 months was independently predictive for symptom-driven IRA revascularization (Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.26–0.97) and for MACE (HR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.24–0.67) (p &lt; 0.05). Segmental function improvements were found in 255 segments (66.1%) and ROC curve analyses showed that AUC (95% CI) of the initial PSS was 0.7(0.65–0.77) (cut-off values = -1.08, sensitivity = 58%, specificity = 73% specificity). Conclusions Post-systolic shortening at 3 months is an independent predictor for symptom-driven IRA revascularization and MACE. Regional wall motion recovery also could be predicted by initial PSS. Serial assessment of two-dimensional STE should be investigated in post-myocardial infarction patients in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3114103432,"Birds often compete and engage in interspecific agonistic interactions for access to resources such as food and breeding territories. Based on the observed outcomes from such interactions (i.e., patterns of displacements) dominance hierarchies can be established. Knowing which species can outcompete others for essential resources allows researchers to make predictions about the broader ecological impacts of interspecific interactions. We constructed an interspecific dominance hierarchy of twelve avian species which visited an artificial water source in an arid region of coastal Patagonia, Argentina. Displacements were categorized into four types, based on the behaviors involved in the interaction, and we tested if they could predict the difference in dominance between the interacting species (the difference between calculated dominance coefficients for the two focal species). Indirect displacements, involving only the arrival of the dominant species to the water source without direct aggression toward the subordinate bird, occurred more frequently between species with a large difference in dominance. The most dominant bird observed was the kelp gull ( Larus dominicanus ), which, due to an increasing population and expanding range, in part due to food supplementation from fisheries waste, is likely to outcompete terrestrial and marine avian species for other scarce resources."
https://openalex.org/W3114309511,"Fluorescent natural compounds have been identified in several marine hosts of microalgae. Their prevalence, and the energy the host is expending on their synthesis, suggests an important, yet poorly understood ecological role. It has been suggested that some of these natural products may enhance the photosynthesis of microbial symbionts. In this study, the effect of Ageladine A (Ag A), a pH-dependent fluorophore found in sponges of the genus Agelas , on the photosynthesis of nine microalgal species and strains was examined. The data showed that the variety of effects of Ag A additions differed between species, and even strains within a species. While in one strain of Synechococcus sp., the presence of Ag A increased gross photosynthesis under UV light exposure, it decreased in another. And while in the chlorophyte T . chuii overall metabolic activity was greatly reduced under all forms of lighting, photosynthesis in T . lutea was positively affected by the addition of Ag A. The variety of effects of Ag A on photosynthesis observed in this study indicate a complex interaction of Ag A with microalgal cells and suggests that a host may be able to shape its own symbiotic microbiome with self-produced natural products."
https://openalex.org/W3115521846,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is an important condition of the human knee. Second ruptures are common and societal costs are substantial. Canine cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture closely models the human disease. CCL rupture is common in the Labrador Retriever (5.79% prevalence), ~100-fold more prevalent than in humans. Labrador Retriever CCL rupture is a polygenic complex disease, based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Dissection of genetic variation in complex traits can be enhanced by studying structural variation, including copy number variants (CNVs). Dogs are an ideal model for CNV research because of reduced genetic variability within breeds and extensive phenotypic diversity across breeds. We studied the genetic etiology of CCL rupture by association analysis of CNV regions (CNVRs) using 110 case and 164 control Labrador Retrievers. CNVs were called from SNPs using three different programs (PennCNV, CNVPartition, and QuantiSNP). After quality control, CNV calls were combined to create CNVRs using ParseCNV and an association analysis was performed. We found no strong effect CNVRs but found 46 small effect (max(T) permutation P &lt;0.05) CCL rupture associated CNVRs in 22 autosomes; 25 were deletions and 21 were duplications. Of the 46 CCL rupture associated CNVRs, we identified 39 unique regions. Thirty four were identified by a single calling algorithm, 3 were identified by two calling algorithms, and 2 were identified by all three algorithms. For 42 of the associated CNVRs, frequency in the population was &lt;10% while 4 occurred at a frequency in the population ranging from 10–25%. Average CNVR length was 198,872bp and CNVRs covered 0.11 to 0.15% of the genome. All CNVRs were associated with case status. CNVRs did not overlap previous canine CCL rupture risk loci identified by GWAS. Associated CNVRs contained 152 annotated genes; 12 CNVRs did not have genes mapped to CanFam3.1. Using pathway analysis, a cluster of 19 homeobox domain transcript regulator genes was associated with CCL rupture ( P = 6.6E-13). This gene cluster influences cranial-caudal body pattern formation during embryonic limb development. Clustered genes were found in 3 CNVRs on chromosome 14 ( HoxA ), 28 ( NKX6-2) , and 36 ( HoxD ). When analysis was limited to deletion CNVRs, the association was strengthened ( P = 8.7E-16). This study suggests a component of the polygenic risk of CCL rupture in Labrador Retrievers is associated with small effect CNVs and may include aspects of stifle morphology regulated by homeobox domain transcript regulator genes."
https://openalex.org/W3115858875,"Free kicks are an important goal scoring opportunity in football. It is an unwritten rule that the goalkeeper places a wall of defending players with the aim of making scoring harder for the attacking team. However, the defensive wall can occlude the movements of the kicker, as well as the initial part of the ball trajectory. Research on one-handed catching suggests that a ball coming into view later will likely delay movement initiation and possibly affect performance. Here, we used virtual reality to investigate the effect of the visual occlusion of the initial ball trajectory by the wall on the performance of naïve participants and skilled goalkeepers. We showed that movements were initiated significantly later when the wall was present, but not by the same amount as the duration of occlusion (~200ms, versus a movement delay of ~70-90ms); movements were thus initiated sooner after the ball came into view, based on less accumulated information. For both naïve participants and skilled goalkeepers this delayed initiation significantly affected performance (i.e., 3.6cm and 1.5cm larger spatial hand error, respectively, not differing significantly between the groups). These performance reductions were significantly larger for shorter flight times, reaching increased spatial errors of 4.5cm and 2.8cm for both groups, respectively. Further analyses showed that the wall-induced performance reduction did not differ significantly between free kicks with and without sideward curve. The wall influenced early movement biases, but only for free kicks with curve in the same direction as the required movement; these biases were away from the final ball position, thus hampering performance. Our results cannot suggest an all-out removal of the wall–this study only considered one potential downside–but should motivate goalkeepers to continuously evaluate whether placing a wall is their best option. This seems most pertinent when facing expert free kick takers for whom the wall does not act as a block (i.e., whose kicks consistently scale the wall)."
https://openalex.org/W3116776636,"Objectives To compare hematologic and serological parameters among patients with Sjogren’s syndrome (SS), dry eye syndrome (DES) and controls, and validate a novel multiplex-serology method for identifying auto-antibodies in these populations. Methods In a clinic-based case-control study a total of 422 participants were recruited, including 91 with SS, 120 DES, and 211 controls (age and sex frequency-matched). We measured blood counts, anti-nuclear-antibodies (ANA), anti-SSA/SSB, anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP), anti-double-stranded-DNA (DS-DNA), and rheumatoid factor (RF) using the “ Immunodot” qualitative-ELISA assay. Immunoglobulins, C3 and C4 were measured by immune-fluorescence. Autoantibodies were also quantified with a newly-developed method using glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins of SSA/Ro 52 and 60kD and SSB/La (multiplex-serology), measuring median fluorescence intensity (MFI). Results Among DES patients, only 2% (95%CI: 0.36–6.3) had positive immune serology. SS patients had lower lymphocyte, hemoglobin and C3 levels but higher prevalence of RF, ANA, anti-SSA/B and higher IgG and MFI levels, compared to DES and controls (P&lt;0.001). Presence of anti-SSA/Ro-52kD was associated with SS [odds ratio (OR) = 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.46–2.88]. Anti-SSB/La was inversely associated with DES (OR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.65–1.00) compared to controls. Positivity to RF (adjusted for age, gender and ethnicity OR = 5.03, 95%CI: 1.78–14.21), ANA (OR = 14.75, 95%CI: 4.09–53.17), or combination of anti-SSA/B (OR = 20.97, 95%CI: 4.60–95.54) were more likely in SS compared to DES. The novel multiplex-serology method correctly identified anti-SSA/B autoantibodies by ELISA among SS, DES patients and controls (sensitivity = 1.0, negative-predictive-value = 1.0). Conclusions Serologic parameters distinguish SS from DES patients and controls. A newly-developed multiplex-serology technique may be useful to detect autoantibodies in large epidemiologic studies."
https://openalex.org/W3118138370,"Laryngeal inflammation causes not only benign diseases of the larynx, such as laryngitis and granuloma, but also malignancy. Dietary factors are known to control or modulate the inflammatory reaction in the body. To date, the association between laryngeal inflammation and dietary factors has not been reported using nationwide population-based data. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between several dietary factors and inflammatory laryngeal disease in the Korean population. This study analyzed the data from Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys which is cross-sectional nationwide-population-based study. Association between the dietary nutrient intake and the prevalence of inflammatory laryngeal diseases was analyzed in 21,116 participants who underwent a laryngoscopy and filled in the dietary intake questionnaires. Of the 21,116 participants included in the analysis, 758 (3.59%) were diagnosed with inflammatory laryngeal disease. Prevalence of inflammatory laryngeal disease was higher in men (4.58%) than in women (2.84%). The mean age of patients was 53.77 years. When analyzing the risk using propensity score matching, ILD group tend to consume more coffee and to intake less fiber and iron than normal group. On Logistic regression analysis, an increased intake of carbohydrate, fiber, and iron was associated with lowered risk of having ILD in female. The association between inflammatory laryngeal disease and dietary factors was prominent in the group aged ≥50 years and female. Increased intake of fiber, iron, and vitamin A were associated with lower risk in the group aged ≥50 years. In female, increased intake of fiber, iron were associated with lower risk of having ILD. In the group aged ≤50 years, only an increased consumption of makgeolli, Korean traditional rice wine, was associated with a higher risk of ILD."
https://openalex.org/W3113446876,"Lizards run quickly and stably in a bipedal gait, with their bodies exhibiting a lateral S-shaped undulation. We investigate the relationship between a lizard’s bipedal running and its body movement with the help of a dynamic simulation. In this study, a dynamic theoretical model of lizard is assumed as a three-link consisting of an anterior and posterior bodies, and a tail, with morphometrics based on Callisaurus draconoides . When a lizard runs straight in a stable bipedal gait, its pelvic rotation is periodically synchronized with its gait. This study shows that the S-shaped body undulation with the yaw motion is generated by minimizing the square of joint torque. Furthermore, we performed the biomechanical simulation to figure out the relationship between the lizard’s lateral body undulation and the bipedal running locomotion. In the biomechanical simulation, all joint torques significantly vary by the waist and tail’ motions at the same locomotion. Besides, when the waist and tail joint angles increase, the stride length and duration of the model also increase, and the stride frequency decreases at the same running speed. It means that the lizard’s undulatory body movements increase its stride and help it run faster. In this study, we found the benefits of the lizard’s undulatory body movement and figured out the relationship between the body movement and the locomotion by analyzing the dynamics. In the future works, we will analyze body movements under different environments with various simulators."
https://openalex.org/W3114096159,"Background There are no epidemiologic data on the relation of depression before colorectal cancer diagnosis to colorectal cancer mortality among women with colorectal cancer, especially those who are postmenopausal. Our aim was to fill this research gap. Methods We analyzed data from a large prospective cohort in the US, the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI). The study included 2,396 women with incident colorectal cancer, assessed for depressive symptoms and antidepressant use before cancer diagnosis at baseline (screening visit in the WHI study) during 1993–1998. Participants were followed up from cancer diagnosis till 2018. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) between depression (depressive symptoms or antidepressant use) at baseline, and all-cause mortality and colorectal cancer-specific mortality. Results Among women with colorectal cancer, there was no association between baseline depression and all-cause mortality or colorectal cancer-specific mortality after adjusting for age or multiple covariates. Conclusion Among women with colorectal cancer, there was no statistically significant association between depression before colorectal cancer diagnosis and all-cause mortality or colorectal cancer-specific mortality. Further studies are warranted to assess depressive symptoms and antidepressant use, measured at multiple points from baseline to diagnosis, and their interactions with specific types of colorectal cancer treatment on the risk of death from colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3116963090,"Background In Denmark, 16,500 cases of melanoma and keratinocyte cancers were registered in 2015, of which 90% could have been avoided by behavioral changes. We aimed to test novel interventions in a randomized design. The interventions targeted Danes going on vacation to high UVI destinations aiming to decrease sunburn by increasing use of sun protection to prevent skin cancer in the Danish population. Methods We report a randomized behavioral intervention during May-Dec 2018 with 1548 Danish adults on vacation in 2018 for a period of 1–3 weeks. The study population was population-based and aged 18–65 years. We tested two protection routines against minimal intervention control group (2-by2-factorial design): 1) Avoidance of the sun during peak hours and shade, use of the UV-index and planning of indoor/outdoor activity respectively and, 2) Coverage by increasing use of the hat advice and increasing sunscreen amount by application routine. Outcome was use of protection and sunburn. Results There were no differences in sunburn prevalence between intervention and control groups. Protection routine 1 and 2 both increased the overall protection score compared to non-users. Protection routine 1 increased the reported use of shade and decreased time exposed in the sun. Protection routine 2 increased the use of hat and sunscreen amount. Conclusion Simple measures can help avoid the majority of one of the most widespread cancers worldwide. Vacations to high UVI destinations is a major influence on the annual Danish UV-exposure. We influenced travelers to protect themselves better and to increase sun protection behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3117510356,"With the worldwide demand for tropical penaeid prawn increasing in recent decades, more research on shrimp culture methods is needed to enhance efficiency and profitability for shrimp farmers. The objective of this study was to develop a technique to boost the productivity, feed efficiency, and profitability of the giant tiger prawn ( Penaeus monodon ). To accomplish this, a novel culture setup was established in which two benthic organisms, a filamentous green alga ( Chaetomorpha sp.) and a microsnail ( Stenothyra sp.), were propagated together with P . monodon post-larvae during an early culture stage and then offered to shrimp as supplementary live feeds in intensive aquaculture ponds. For the experiment, shrimp post-larvae (density: approximately 33 individuals m -2 ) were cultured in outdoor concrete ponds (9 × 9 × 1.2 m) under either control (fed only artificial feed, n = 3) or experimental (fed artificial feed and benthic organisms, n = 3) conditions until they reached marketable size (15 weeks). Apparent green algae consumption was 6.81 kg (8.4% green alga to total feed consumption), whereas microsnail consumption was 1.96 kg (2.4% microsnail to total feed consumption). Compared with the control group of giant tiger prawn, the experimental group showed significantly higher productivity (total number of shrimp produced: 118%; total shrimp production: 133%), feed efficiency (feed conversion ratio of artificial shrimp feed: 89%), and profitability (shrimp sales: 139%; balance between shrimp sales and costs: 146%), while labor and financial costs were kept minimal. These results can be explained by the enhanced growth of shrimp at the early stages of culture. The techniques developed in this study will help to advance the efficiency of intensive aquaculture operations for giant tiger prawn and also improve profitability for shrimp farmers."
