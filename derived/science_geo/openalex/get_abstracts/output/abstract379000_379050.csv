https://openalex.org/W2160842288,"Using friction force microscopy, we compared the nanoscale frictional characteristics of atomically thin sheets of graphene, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), niobium diselenide, and hexagonal boron nitride exfoliated onto a weakly adherent substrate (silicon oxide) to those of their bulk counterparts. Measurements down to single atomic sheets revealed that friction monotonically increased as the number of layers decreased for all four materials. Suspended graphene membranes showed the same trend, but binding the graphene strongly to a mica surface suppressed the trend. Tip-sample adhesion forces were indistinguishable for all thicknesses and substrate arrangements. Both graphene and MoS2 exhibited atomic lattice stick-slip friction, with the thinnest sheets possessing a sliding-length-dependent increase in static friction. These observations, coupled with finite element modeling, suggest that the trend arises from the thinner sheets' increased susceptibility to out-of-plane elastic deformation. The generality of the results indicates that this may be a universal characteristic of nanoscale friction for atomically thin materials weakly bound to substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2119854546,"Jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) is a plant hormone that regulates a broad array of plant defence and developmental processes. JA-Ile-responsive gene expression is regulated by the transcriptional activator MYC2 that interacts physically with the jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) repressor proteins. On perception of JA-Ile, JAZ proteins are degraded and JA-Ile-dependent gene expression is activated. The molecular mechanisms by which JAZ proteins repress gene expression remain unknown. Here we show that the Arabidopsis JAZ proteins recruit the Groucho/Tup1-type co-repressor TOPLESS (TPL) and TPL-related proteins (TPRs) through a previously uncharacterized adaptor protein, designated Novel Interactor of JAZ (NINJA). NINJA acts as a transcriptional repressor whose activity is mediated by a functional TPL-binding EAR repression motif. Accordingly, both NINJA and TPL proteins function as negative regulators of jasmonate responses. Our results point to TPL proteins as general co-repressors that affect multiple signalling pathways through the interaction with specific adaptor proteins. This new insight reveals how stress-related and growth-related signalling cascades use common molecular mechanisms to regulate gene expression in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2062558324,"Atom interferometers, which rely on the wave properties of particles, are used in a variety of ultra-high-precision measurements, from determining the gravitational constant to defining the time standard. The precision of interferometers is generally limited by classical statistics, arising from the finite number of atoms used in the experiment. Two papers in this issue demonstrate the potential of 'spin-squeezing' in Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) to facilitate measurements that are more precise than classical statistics allow. Using a specially prepared BEC as the input to an interferometer, Gross et al. beat the classical precision limit. In the second study, Riedel et al. create similar 'spin-squeezed' states in a BEC confined to an 'atom chip' by controlling elastic collisional interactions with a state-dependent potential. This demonstration of multi-particle entanglement on a chip raises the prospect of chip-based portable atomic clocks that also beat the classical precision limits. The precision of interferometers — used in metrology and in the state-of-the-art time standard — is generally limited by classical statistics. Here it is shown that the classical precision limit can be beaten by using nonlinear atom interferometry with Bose–Einstein condensates. Interference is fundamental to wave dynamics and quantum mechanics. The quantum wave properties of particles are exploited in metrology using atom interferometers, allowing for high-precision inertia measurements1,2. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art time standard is based on an interferometric technique known as Ramsey spectroscopy. However, the precision of an interferometer is limited by classical statistics owing to the finite number of atoms used to deduce the quantity of interest3. Here we show experimentally that the classical precision limit can be surpassed using nonlinear atom interferometry with a Bose–Einstein condensate. Controlled interactions between the atoms lead to non-classical entangled states within the interferometer; this represents an alternative approach to the use of non-classical input states4,5,6,7,8. Extending quantum interferometry9 to the regime of large atom number, we find that phase sensitivity is enhanced by 15 per cent relative to that in an ideal classical measurement. Our nonlinear atomic beam splitter follows the ‘one-axis-twisting’ scheme10 and implements interaction control using a narrow Feshbach resonance. We perform noise tomography of the quantum state within the interferometer and detect coherent spin squeezing with a squeezing factor of -8.2 dB (refs 11–15). The results provide information on the many-particle quantum state, and imply the entanglement of 170 atoms16."
https://openalex.org/W2065455422,"Despite our rapidly growing knowledge about the human genome, we do not know all of the genes required for some of the most basic functions of life. To start to fill this gap we developed a high-throughput phenotypic screening platform combining potent gene silencing by RNA interference, time-lapse microscopy and computational image processing. We carried out a genome-wide phenotypic profiling of each of the approximately 21,000 human protein-coding genes by two-day live imaging of fluorescently labelled chromosomes. Phenotypes were scored quantitatively by computational image processing, which allowed us to identify hundreds of human genes involved in diverse biological functions including cell division, migration and survival. As part of the Mitocheck consortium, this study provides an in-depth analysis of cell division phenotypes and makes the entire high-content data set available as a resource to the community."
https://openalex.org/W2130542470,"Copy number variants (CNVs) account for a major proportion of human genetic polymorphism and have been predicted to have an important role in genetic susceptibility to common disease. To address this we undertook a large, direct genome-wide study of association between CNVs and eight common human diseases. Using a purpose-designed array we typed ∼19,000 individuals into distinct copy-number classes at 3,432 polymorphic CNVs, including an estimated ∼50% of all common CNVs larger than 500 base pairs. We identified several biological artefacts that lead to false-positive associations, including systematic CNV differences between DNAs derived from blood and cell lines. Association testing and follow-up replication analyses confirmed three loci where CNVs were associated with disease—IRGM for Crohn’s disease, HLA for Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes, and TSPAN8 for type 2 diabetes—although in each case the locus had previously been identified in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based studies, reflecting our observation that most common CNVs that are well-typed on our array are well tagged by SNPs and so have been indirectly explored through SNP studies. We conclude that common CNVs that can be typed on existing platforms are unlikely to contribute greatly to the genetic basis of common human diseases."

Neronov and Vovk (p. 73 ) present evidence for the existence of intergalactic magnetic fields and derive a lower limit for their strength, based on an analysis of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The results place constraints on magnetogenesis models and suggest that magnetic fields originated in the early universe before galaxy formation took place."

https://openalex.org/W2065738753,"The 22q11.2 microdeletion is one of the most reliable known genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. Mice with a disruption in the equivalent chromosomal region have problems with working memory, one feature of schizophrenia. Sigurdsson et al. show that these mice also have disruptions in synchronous firing between prefrontal cortex and hippocampal neurons, a phenomenon that has been linked to learning and memory, and which is also disrupted in schizophrenia patients. These findings suggest that disruption of communication between these brain regions may underlie schizophrenia, and efforts to ameliorate this disruption may lead to novel treatments. A deletion on human chromosome 22 (22q11.2) is one of the largest genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. Mice with a corresponding deletion have problems with working memory, one feature of schizophrenia. It is now found that these mice also show disruptions in synchronous firing between neurons of the prefrontal cortex and of the hippocampus, an electrophysiological phenomenon that has been linked to learning and memory and which is also thought to be disrupted in schizophrenia patients. Abnormalities in functional connectivity between brain areas have been postulated as an important pathophysiological mechanism underlying schizophrenia1,2. In particular, macroscopic measurements of brain activity in patients suggest that functional connectivity between the frontal and temporal lobes may be altered3,4. However, it remains unclear whether such dysconnectivity relates to the aetiology of the illness, and how it is manifested in the activity of neural circuits. Because schizophrenia has a strong genetic component5, animal models of genetic risk factors are likely to aid our understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disease. Here we study Df(16)A+/– mice, which model a microdeletion on human chromosome 22 (22q11.2) that constitutes one of the largest known genetic risk factors for schizophrenia6. To examine functional connectivity in these mice, we measured the synchronization of neural activity between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex during the performance of a task requiring working memory, which is one of the cognitive functions disrupted in the disease. In wild-type mice, hippocampal–prefrontal synchrony increased during working memory performance, consistent with previous reports in rats7. Df(16)A+/– mice, which are impaired in the acquisition of the task, showed drastically reduced synchrony, measured both by phase-locking of prefrontal cells to hippocampal theta oscillations and by coherence of prefrontal and hippocampal local field potentials. Furthermore, the magnitude of hippocampal–prefrontal coherence at the onset of training could be used to predict the time it took the Df(16)A+/– mice to learn the task and increased more slowly during task acquisition. These data suggest how the deficits in functional connectivity observed in patients with schizophrenia may be realized at the single-neuron level. Our findings further suggest that impaired long-range synchrony of neural activity is one consequence of the 22q11.2 deletion and may be a fundamental component of the pathophysiology underlying schizophrenia."

Depending on the tag used, Hutchins et al.

Applying the technology to proteins implicated in control of cell division revealed about 100 protein machines required for mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2100026237,"Based largely on evidence from post-mortem examination of brain tissue, it is thought that abnormal fibrillar deposits of tau protein — which when functioning normally acts to stabilize microtubules — cause apoptosis and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and tau-related frontotemporal dementia. Now in vivo multiphoton imaging of these neurofibrillary tangles in transgenic mice overexpressing a human tau gene reveals a rather different scenario. Caspase activation — a known marker for apoptosis — is the first abnormality observed, preceding tangle formation by hours to days. Rather than suffering cell death, neuronal cells bearing tangles appear to be long-lived, and caspase activity subsides. It is therefore possible that soluble tau, rather than fibrillar tau, is causing neurodegeneration. As to the relevance of this work to the value of 'tangle-busting' drugs in countering neurodegeneration, much depends on whether neurofibrillary tangles are a protective factor, an irrelevance to the disease, or are associated with slow-acting neurotoxicity. Fibrillar deposits of tau protein (neurofibrillary tangles) are thought to cause neuronal death in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and tau-related frontotemporal dementia. Here, however, the opposite has been found: the activation of executioner caspase enzymes occurs first, preceding tangle formation by hours to days. Tangle-bearing neurons seem to be long-lived, indicating that tangles might be 'off pathway' to acute neuronal death. Studies of post-mortem tissue have shown that the location of fibrillar tau deposits, called neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), matches closely with regions of massive neuronal death1,2, severe cytological abnormalities3, and markers of caspase activation and apoptosis4,5,6, leading to the idea that tangles cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and tau-related frontotemporal dementia. However, using in vivo multiphoton imaging to observe tangles and activation of executioner caspases in living tau transgenic mice (Tg4510 strain), we find the opposite: caspase activation occurs first, and precedes tangle formation by hours to days. New tangles form within a day. After a new tangle forms, the neuron remains alive and caspase activity seems to be suppressed. Similarly, introduction of wild-type 4-repeat tau (tau-4R) into wild-type animals triggered caspase activation, tau truncation and tau aggregation. Adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of a construct mimicking caspase-cleaved tau into wild-type mice led to the appearance of intracellular aggregates, tangle-related conformational- and phospho-epitopes, and the recruitment of full-length endogenous tau to the aggregates. On the basis of these data, we propose a new model in which caspase activation cleaves tau to initiate tangle formation, then truncated tau recruits normal tau to misfold and form tangles. Because tangle-bearing neurons are long-lived, we suggest that tangles are ‘off pathway’ to acute neuronal death. Soluble tau species, rather than fibrillar tau, may be the critical toxic moiety underlying neurodegeneration."

A handful of factors that control AP1 have been identified, as well as some targets that AP1 controls. Kaufmann et al. (p. 85 ) now apply genome-wide microarray analysis to identify over a thousand genes whose transcription is regulated by AP1. By proximity to AP1 binding sites, over two thousand genes are implicated as putative AP1 targets. Analysis of this network of interactions indicates that AP1 functions first to repress vegetative identity, then to help establish floral primordia, and finally to shape the differentiation of floral parts."
https://openalex.org/W1989199118,"The T-cell receptor (TCR) interacts with peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC) to discriminate pathogens from self-antigens and trigger adaptive immune responses. Direct physical contact is required between the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell for cross-junctional binding where the TCR and pMHC are anchored on two-dimensional (2D) membranes of the apposing cells. Despite their 2D nature, TCR-pMHC binding kinetics have only been analysed three-dimensionally (3D) with a varying degree of correlation with the T-cell responsiveness. Here we use two mechanical assays to show high 2D affinities between a TCR and its antigenic pMHC driven by rapid on-rates. Compared to their 3D counterparts, 2D affinities and on-rates of the TCR for a panel of pMHC ligands possess far broader dynamic ranges that match that of their corresponding T-cell responses. The best 3D predictor of response is the off-rate, with agonist pMHC dissociating the slowest. In contrast, 2D off-rates are up to 8,300-fold faster, with the agonist pMHC dissociating the fastest. Our 2D data suggest rapid antigen sampling by T cells and serial engagement of a few agonist pMHCs by TCRs in a large self pMHC background. Thus, the cellular environment amplifies the intrinsic TCR-pMHC binding to generate broad affinities and rapid kinetics that determine T-cell responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2154420373,"Open and Closed Case Voltage-dependent ion channels are gated by voltage sensors that show a switchlike response to voltage differences across the membrane. Tao et al. (p. 67 ; see the cover) used mutagenesis, electrophysiology, and x-ray crystallography to gain insight into the molecular basis of this response in voltage-dependent potassium channels. An occluded site was identified that catalyzes translation of positive charges across the membrane. The closed channel appears to be associated with a distribution of conformations, depending on the degree of hyperpolarization of the membrane, whereas the open channel appears to be associated with a specific conformation. Thus, the transition of the ion channel from open to closed occurs over a very small voltage difference."

https://openalex.org/W2084396631,"Semiconservative DNA replication ensures the faithful duplication of genetic information during cell divisions. However, how epigenetic information carried by histone modifications propagates through mitotic divisions remains elusive. To address this question, the DNA replication-dependent nucleosome partition pattern must be clarified. Here, we report significant amounts of H3.3-H4 tetramers split in vivo, whereas most H3.1-H4 tetramers remained intact. Inhibiting DNA replication-dependent deposition greatly reduced the level of splitting events, which suggests that (i) the replication-independent H3.3 deposition pathway proceeds largely by cooperatively incorporating two new H3.3-H4 dimers and (ii) the majority of splitting events occurred during replication-dependent deposition. Our results support the idea that ""silent"" histone modifications within large heterochromatic regions are maintained by copying modifications from neighboring preexisting histones without the need for H3-H4 splitting events."

https://openalex.org/W1971668778,"African sleeping sickness or human African trypanosomiasis, caused by Trypanosoma brucei spp., is responsible for ∼30,000 deaths each year. Available treatments for this disease are poor, with unacceptable efficacy and safety profiles, particularly in the late stage of the disease when the parasite has infected the central nervous system. Here we report the validation of a molecular target and the discovery of associated lead compounds with the potential to address this lack of suitable treatments. Inhibition of this target—T. brucei N-myristoyltransferase—leads to rapid killing of trypanosomes both in vitro and in vivo and cures trypanosomiasis in mice. These high-affinity inhibitors bind into the peptide substrate pocket of the enzyme and inhibit protein N-myristoylation in trypanosomes. The compounds identified have promising pharmaceutical properties and represent an opportunity to develop oral drugs to treat this devastating disease. Our studies validate T. brucei N-myristoyltransferase as a promising therapeutic target for human African trypanosomiasis. African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, caused by Trypanosoma brucei spp., is responsible for some 30,000 deaths each year. The few treatments that are available tend to involve drugs with poor efficacy and safety profiles. N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), which adds myristate to the N-terminal glycine of many eukaryotic and microbial proteins, has been suggested as a possible target for drugs to treat trypanosomiasis and other parasitic diseases — if selectivity to protect the human enzyme can be achieved. A new study validates T. brucei NMT as a viable protein target for antitrypanosomals, and a potent inhibitor with drug-like properties has been identified. The compound, DDD85646, kills T. brucei in the bloodstream in mouse models. African sleeping sickness, caused by Trypanosoma brucei species, is responsible for some 30,000 human deaths each year. Available treatments are limited by poor efficacy and safety profiles. However, a new molecular target for potential treatments has now been identified. The protein target is T. brucei N-myristoyltransferase. In further experiments, lead compounds have been discovered that inhibit this protein, kill trypanosomes in vitro and in vivo, and can cure trypanosomiasis in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2049504065,"Cytomegalovirus Immune Evasion Strategy Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects a large percentage of the world's population. Most of those infected are asymptomatic; however, CMV is a substantial public health concern for immunocompromised individuals and neonates. CMV is unusual in that it can superinfect: it re-infects hosts who are already infected with the virus, even in the presence of a strong, specific immune response. Hansen et al. (p. 102 ; see the Perspective by Hengel and Koszinowski ) now find that in rhesus macaques, a good model for human CMV superinfection, CMV establishes superinfections by evading the immune response mediated by CD8 + T cells. A series of viral mutants deficient in expression of the US2-11 glycoproteins, which regulate antigen presentation to CD8 + T cells, revealed that, although able to establish the initial infection, these viral mutants were unable to superinfect. Depletion of CD8 + T cells from the monkeys allowed infection by the mutant viruses. These results highlight the difficulties in developing an effective protective vaccine against CMV itself, but suggest that CMV-based vectors may be useful in other vaccine efforts such as those against HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2064746618,"The proteasome catalyzes the majority of protein degradation in the cell and plays an integral role in cellular homeostasis. Control over proteolysis by the 20S core-particle (CP) proteasome is achieved by gated access of substrate; thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanism by which these gates regulate substrate entry is critical. We used methyl-transverse relaxation optimized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that the amino-terminal residues that compose the gates of the alpha subunits of the Thermoplasma acidophilum proteasome are highly dynamic over a broad spectrum of time scales and that gating termini are in conformations that extend either well inside (closed gate) or outside (open gate) of the antechamber. Interconversion between these conformers on a time scale of seconds leads to a dynamic regulation of 20S CP proteolysis activity."

The resolved gamma-ray image shows the lobes clearly separated from the central active source. In contrast to all other active galaxies detected so far in high-energy gamma-rays, the lobe flux constitutes a considerable portion (>1/2) of the total source emission. The gamma-ray emission from the lobes is interpreted as inverse Compton scattered relic radiation from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), with additional contribution at higher energies from the infrared-to-optical extragalactic background light (EBL). These measurements provide gamma-ray constraints on the magnetic field and particle energy content in radio galaxy lobes, and a promising method to probe the cosmic relic photon fields."

Using the recorded spike trains as inputs to the model, and constraining the model by the measured output spike trains, allowed strong predictions of the degree of convergence of synchronous inputs from the lateral geniculate nucleus. Synchrony, rather than the strength or frequency of synaptic inputs, was key to signaling, and the data suggest that there may be a region of optimal synchronous coding."

This study investigated the coinheritance of 12 functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human P2X(7) gene (P2RX7), and the functional effect of each singly and in combination was assessed by measurements of ATP-induced currents and ethidium(+) uptake. Genotyping of 3430 Caucasian subjects identified 4 common haplotypes in addition to the common (wild-type) P2X(7)-1. Two haplotypes (denoted P2X(7)-2 and P2X(7)-4) contained various combinations of gain-of-function SNPs. P2X(7)-4 was identified uniquely by the Gln-460 to Arg polymorphism (rs2230912). When expressed in HEK-293 cells, recombinant P2X(7)-2, and P2X(7)-4 haplotypes displayed a 3-fold and 5-fold increase, respectively, in receptor function compared to the wild-type P2X(7)-1. Both P2X(7) haplotypes contained the Ala-348>Thr polymorphism (rs1718119), and this mutation was critical for the gain-of-function effect. Peripheral blood monocytes and erythrocytes from subjects homozygous for gain-of-function P2X(7) haplotypes exhibited increased ATP-induced ethidium(+) uptake and (86)Rb(+) efflux, respectively, and this correlated with increased IL-1beta secretion from LPS-primed monocytes. Inheritance of these P2X(7) haplotypes predisposing to increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion may be important in genetic association studies of inflammatory, infectious, and psychiatric disorders."

The oxygen isotopic composition of soil carbonates has been used as a proxy for altitude and to measure the timing of uplift. Poulsen et al.

https://openalex.org/W2080849305,"Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) act on highly homologous receptors, yet in vivo elicit distinct effects on metabolism and growth. To investigate how the insulin and IGF-1 receptors exert specificity in their biological responses, we assessed their role in the regulation of gene expression using three experimental paradigms: 1) preadipocytes before and after differentiation into adipocytes that express both receptors, but at different ratios; 2) insulin receptor (IR) or IGF1R knock-out preadipocytes that only express the complimentary receptor; and 3) IR/IGF1R double knock-out (DKO) cells reconstituted with the IR, IGF1R, or both. In wild-type preadipocytes, which express predominantly IGF1R, microarray analysis revealed approximately 500 IGF-1 regulated genes (p < 0.05). The largest of these were confirmed by quantitative PCR, which also revealed that insulin produced a similar effect, but with a smaller magnitude of response. After differentiation, when IR levels increase and IGF1R decrease, insulin became the dominant regulator of each of these genes. Measurement of the 50 most highly regulated genes by quantitative PCR did not reveal a single gene regulated uniquely via the IR or IGF1R using cells expressing exclusively IGF-1 or insulin receptors. Insulin and IGF-1 dose responses from 1 to 100 nm in WT, IRKO, IGFRKO, and DKO cells re-expressing IR, IGF1R, or both showed that insulin and IGF-1 produced effects in proportion to the concentration of ligand and the specific receptor on which they act. Thus, IR and IGF1R act as identical portals to the regulation of gene expression, with differences between insulin and IGF-1 effects due to a modulation of the amplitude of the signal created by the specific ligand-receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2123573371,"Background Multiple myeloma (MM) expands almost exclusively in the bone marrow and generates devastating bone lesions, in which bone formation is impaired and osteoclastic bone resorption is enhanced. TGF-β, a potent inhibitor of terminal osteoblast (OB) differentiation, is abundantly deposited in the bone matrix, and released and activated by the enhanced bone resorption in MM. The present study was therefore undertaken to clarify the role of TGF-β and its inhibition in bone formation and tumor growth in MM. Methodology/Principal Findings TGF-β suppressed OB differentiation from bone marrow stromal cells and MC3T3-E1 preosteoblastic cells, and also inhibited adipogenesis from C3H10T1/2 immature mesenchymal cells, suggesting differentiation arrest by TGF-β. Inhibitors for a TGF-β type I receptor kinase, SB431542 and Ki26894, potently enhanced OB differentiation from bone marrow stromal cells as well as MC3T3-E1 cells. The TGF-β inhibition was able to restore OB differentiation suppressed by MM cell conditioned medium as well as bone marrow plasma from MM patients. Interestingly, TGF-β inhibition expedited OB differentiation in parallel with suppression of MM cell growth. The anti-MM activity was elaborated exclusively by terminally differentiated OBs, which potentiated the cytotoxic effects of melphalan and dexamethasone on MM cells. Furthermore, TGF-β inhibition was able to suppress MM cell growth within the bone marrow while preventing bone destruction in MM-bearing animal models. Conclusions/Significance The present study demonstrates that TGF-β inhibition releases stromal cells from their differentiation arrest by MM and facilitates the formation of terminally differentiated OBs, and that terminally differentiated OBs inhibit MM cell growth and survival and enhance the susceptibility of MM cells to anti-MM agents to overcome the drug resistance mediated by stromal cells. Therefore, TGF-β appears to be an important therapeutic target in MM bone lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1981494266,"Progression through mitosis requires the coordinated regulation of Cdk1 kinase activity. Activation of Cdk1 is a multistep process comprising binding of Cdk1 to cyclin B, relocation of cyclin-kinase complexes to the nucleus, activating phosphorylation of Cdk1 on Thr(161) by the Cdk-activating kinase (CAK; Cdk7 in metazoans), and removal of inhibitory Thr(14) and Tyr(15) phosphorylations. This dephosphorylation is catalyzed by the dual specific Cdc25 phosphatases, which occur in three isoforms in mammalian cells, Cdc25A, -B, and -C. We find that expression of Cdc25A leads to an accelerated G(2)/M phase transition. In Cdc25A-overexpressing cells, Cdk1 exhibits high kinase activity despite being phosphorylated on Tyr(15). In addition, Tyr(15)-phosphorylated Cdk1 binds more cyclin B in Cdc25A-overexpressing cells compared with control cells. Consistent with this observation, we demonstrate that in human transformed cells, Cdc25A and Cdc25B, but not Cdc25C phosphatases have an effect on timing and efficiency of cyclin-kinase complex formation. Overexpression of Cdc25A or Cdc25B promotes earlier assembly and activation of Cdk1-cyclin B complexes, whereas repression of these phosphatases by short hairpin RNA has a reverse effect, leading to a substantial decrease in amounts of cyclin B-bound Cdk1 in G(2) and mitosis. Importantly, we find that Cdc25A overexpression leads to an activation of Cdk7 and increase in Thr(161) phosphorylation of Cdk1. In conclusion, our data suggest that complex assembly and dephosphorylation of Cdk1 at G(2)/M is tightly coupled and regulated by Cdc25 phosphatases."

One EphA2 mutation was modeled by expression in BEAS2B cells, and functional and biochemical studies were conducted. A G391R mutation was detected in H2170 and 2/28 squamous cell carcinoma patient samples. EphA2 G391R caused constitutive activation of EphA2 with increased phosphorylation of Src, cortactin, and p130(Cas). Wild-type (WT) and G391R cells had 20 and 40% increased invasiveness; this was attenuated with knockdown of Src, cortactin, or p130(Cas). WT and G391R cells demonstrated a 70% increase in focal adhesion area. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation was increased in G391R cells with increased survival (55%) compared with WT (30%) and had increased sensitivity to rapamycin. A recurrent EphA2 mutation is present in lung squamous cell carcinoma and increases tumor invasion and survival through activation of focal adhesions and actin cytoskeletal regulatory proteins as well as mTOR.

Further dilution induces a functional disconnection of light-harvesting complex (LHC) II from PSII. It is concluded that efficient light harvesting by PSII requires an optimal protein packing density in grana membranes that is close to 70%. We hypothesize that the decreased efficiency in overcrowded isolated grana thylakoids is caused by excited state quenching in LHCII, which has previously been correlated with neoxanthin distortion. Resonance Raman spectroscopy confirms this increase in neoxanthin distortion in overcrowded grana as compared with intact thylakoids. Furthermore, analysis of the changes in the antenna size in highly diluted membranes indicates a lipid-induced dissociation of up to two trimeric LHCII from PSII, leaving one trimer connected. This observation supports a hierarchy of LHCII-binding sites on PSII."
https://openalex.org/W1966260649,"The homotetrameric Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein plays a central role in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. In addition to its essential activity of binding to transiently formed single-stranded (ss) DNA, SSB also binds an array of partner proteins and recruits them to their sites of action using its four intrinsically disordered C-terminal tails. Here we show that the binding of ssDNA to SSB is inhibited by the SSB C-terminal tails, specifically by the last 8 highly acidic amino acids that comprise the binding site for its multiple partner proteins. We examined the energetics of ssDNA binding to short oligodeoxynucleotides and find that at moderate salt concentration, removal of the acidic C-terminal ends increases the intrinsic affinity for ssDNA and enhances the negative cooperativity between ssDNA binding sites, indicating that the C termini exert an inhibitory effect on ssDNA binding. This inhibitory effect decreases as the salt concentration increases. Binding of ssDNA to approximately half of the SSB subunits relieves the inhibitory effect for all of the subunits. The inhibition by the C termini is due primarily to a less favorable entropy change upon ssDNA binding. These observations explain why ssDNA binding to SSB enhances the affinity of SSB for its partner proteins and suggest that the C termini of SSB may interact, at least transiently, with its ssDNA binding sites. This inhibition and its relief by ssDNA binding suggest a mechanism that enhances the ability of SSB to selectively recruit its partner proteins to sites on DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2015862061,"Background Existing studies indicate a significant genetic component for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide an unbiased approach for identification of novel genes. We performed a GWAS to identify genetic determinants of SCA. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a case-control design within the ongoing Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon-SUDS). Cases (n = 424) were SCAs with coronary artery disease (CAD) among residents of Portland, OR (2002–07, population ∼1,000,000) and controls (n = 226) were residents with CAD, but no history of SCA. All subjects were of White-European ancestry and GWAS was performed using Affymetrix 500K/5.0 and 6.0 arrays. High signal markers were genotyped in SCA cases (n = 521) identified from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) (combined n = 19,611). No SNPs reached genome-wide significance (p<5×10−8). SNPs at 6 loci were prioritized for follow-up primarily based on significance of p<10−4 and proximity to a known gene (CSMD2, GPR37L1, LIN9, B4GALNT3, GPC5, and ZNF592). The minor allele of GPC5 (GLYPICAN 5, rs3864180) was associated with a lower risk of SCA in Oregon-SUDS, an effect that was also observed in ARIC/CHS whites (p<0.05) and blacks (p<0.04). In a combined Cox proportional hazards model analysis that adjusted for race, the minor allele exhibited a hazard ratio of 0.85 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; p<0.01). Conclusions/Significance A novel genetic locus for SCA, GPC5, was identified from Oregon-SUDS and successfully validated in the ARIC and CHS cohorts. Three other members of the Glypican family have been previously implicated in human disease, including cardiac conditions. The mechanism of this specific association requires further study."
https://openalex.org/W2086488804,"Uncoupling Proteins (UCPs) are integral ion channels residing in the inner mitochondrial membrane. UCP2 is ubiquitously expressed, while UCP3 is found primarily in muscles and adipose tissue. Although the exact molecular mechanism of action is controversial, it is generally agreed that both homologues function to facilitate mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. UCP2 and -3 expression is activated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), but so far no PPAR response element has been reported in the vicinity of the Ucp2 and Ucp3 genes. Using genome-wide profiling of PPARgamma occupancy in 3T3-L1 adipocytes we demonstrate that PPARgamma associates with three chromosomal regions in the vicinity of the Ucp3 locus and weakly with a site in intron 1 of the Ucp2 gene. These sites are isolated from the nearest neighboring sites by >900 kb. The most prominent PPARgamma binding site in the Ucp2 and Ucp3 loci is located in intron 1 of the Ucp3 gene and is the only site that facilitates PPARgamma transactivation of a heterologous promoter. This site furthermore transactivates the endogenous Ucp3 promoter, and using chromatin conformation capture we show that it loops out to specifically interact with the Ucp2 promoter and intron 1. Our data indicate that PPARgamma transactivation of both UCP2 and -3 is mediated through this novel enhancer in Ucp3 intron 1."
https://openalex.org/W2008370397,"Regulation of the number of Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels at the endothelial cell surface contributes to control of the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor response, although this process is poorly understood. To address the fate of plasma membrane-localized KCa2.3, we utilized an extracellular epitope-tagged channel in combination with fluorescence and biotinylation techniques in both human embryonic kidney cells and the human microvascular endothelial cell line, HMEC-1. KCa2.3 was internalized from the plasma membrane and degraded with a time constant of 18 h. Cell surface biotinylation demonstrated that KCa2.3 was rapidly endocytosed and recycled back to the plasma membrane. Consistent with recycling, expression of a dominant negative (DN) RME-1 or Rab35 as well as wild type EPI64C, the Rab35 GTPase-activating protein, resulted in accumulation of KCa2.3 in an intracellular compartment. Expression of DN RME-1, DN Rab35, or wild type EPI64C resulted in a decrease in steady-state plasma membrane expression. Knockdown of EPI64C increased cell surface expression of KCa2.3. Furthermore, the effect of EPI64C was dependent upon its GTPase-activating proteins activity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed an association between KCa2.3 and both Rab35 and RME-1. In contrast to KCa2.3, KCa3.1 was rapidly endocytosed and degraded in an RME-1 and Rab35-independent manner. A series of N-terminal deletions identified a 12-amino acid region, Gly(206)-Pro(217), as being required for the rapid recycling of KCa2.3. Deletion of Gly(206)-Pro(217) had no effect on the association of KCa2.3 with Rab35 but significantly decreased the association with RME-1. These represent the first studies elucidating the mechanisms by which KCa2.3 is maintained at the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2135111988,"Nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) play vital roles in the regulation of metabolism, reproduction, and development. We found that inactivation of a C. elegans HNF4 homologue nhr-64 by RNA interference (RNAi) suppresses low fat stores in stearoyl-CoA desaturase-deficient fat-6;fat-7 double mutants and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) sbp-1 mutants. Furthermore, inactivation of nhr-64 improves the growth rate of the fat-6;fat-7and sbp-1 strains. While nhr-64RNAi subtly affects fatty acid composition and fat storage in wild-type C. elegans, its effects on lipid metabolism are most apparent in the background of stearoyl-CoA desaturase or SREBP deficiency. NHR-64 displays transcriptional activating activity when expressed in yeast, and inactivation of nhr-64 affects the expression of at least 14 metabolic genes. Wild-type worms treated with nhr-64 RNAi display increased expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase as well as increased abundance of de novo synthesized monomethyl branched chain fatty acids, suggesting an increase in fat synthesis. However, reduced expression of the acetyl-CoA synthetase gene acs-2 and an acyl-CoA oxidase gene indicates that a key role of NHR-64 may be to promote fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria and peroxisomes. These studies reveal that NHR-64 is an important regulator of fat storage in C. elegans."

These cells are progenitors able to differentiate toward mesenchymal, endothelial and cardiomyogenic lineages. Here we present an extensive molecular characterization of MPCs, from bone marrow samples, including 39 genes involved in stem cell machinery, differentiation and cell cycle regulation. Methodology/Principal Findings MPCs are cytofluorimetrically characterized and quantitative RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the gene expression profile, comparing it with MSCs and hESCs lines. Immunofluorescence and dot-blot analysis confirm qRT-PCR data. MPCs exhibit an increased expression of OCT4, NANOG, SALL4, FBX15, SPP1 and to a lesser extent c-MYC and KLF4, but lack LIN28 and SOX2. MPCs highly express SOX15. Conclusions/Significance MPCs express many pluripotency-associated genes and show a peculiar Oct-4 molecular circuit. Understanding this unique molecular mechanism could lead to identifying MPCs as feasible, long telomeres, target cells for reprogramming with no up-regulation of the p53 pathway. Furthermore MPCs are easily and inexpensively harvested from human bone marrow."

https://openalex.org/W1978411500,"The ezrin-radixin-moesin proteins provide a regulated linkage between membrane proteins and the cortical cytoskeleton and also participate in signal transduction pathways. Ezrin is localized to the apical membrane of parietal cells and couples the protein kinase A activation cascade to the regulated HCl secretion. Our recent proteomic study revealed a protein complex of ezrin-ACAP4-ARF6 essential for volatile membrane remodeling (Fang, Z., Miao, Y., Ding, X., Deng, H., Liu, S., Wang, F., Zhou, R., Watson, C., Fu, C., Hu, Q., Lillard, J.

However, knowledge of whether ACAP4 physically interacts with ezrin and how their interaction is integrated into membrane-cytoskeletal remodeling has remained elusive. Here we provide the first evidence that ezrin interacts with ACAP4 in a protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation-dependent manner through the N-terminal 400 amino acids of ACAP4. ACAP4 locates in the cytoplasmic membrane in resting parietal cells but translocates to the apical plasma membrane upon histamine stimulation. ACAP4 was precipitated with ezrin from secreting but not resting parietal cell lysates, suggesting a phospho-regulated interaction. Indeed, this interaction is abolished by phosphatase treatment and validated by an in vitro reconstitution assay using phospho-mimicking ezrinS66D. Importantly, ezrin specifies the apical distribution of ACAP4 in secreting parietal cells because either suppression of ezrin or overexpression of non-phosphorylatable ezrin prevents the apical localization of ACAP4.

Taken together, these results define a novel molecular mechanism linking ACAP4-ezrin interaction to polarized epithelial secretion. IntroductionThe functions of an epithelium depend on the polarized organization of its individual epithelial cells. The acquisition of a fully polarized phenotype involves a cascade of complex events, including cell-cell adhesion, assembly of a lateral cortical complex, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and polarized targeting of transport vesicles to the apical and basolateral membranes (1Yeaman C.

Biol. 1999; 9: R515-R517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Ezrin is an actin-binding protein of the ezrin/radixin/moesin family of cytoskeleton-membrane linker proteins (2Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Within the gastric epithelium, ezrin has been localized exclusively to parietal cells and primarily to the apical canalicular membrane of these cells (e.g. see Refs. 3Urushidani T. Hanzel D.K.

Our previous studies showed that gastric ezrin is co-distributed with the β-actin isoform in vivo (5Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol.

Forte J.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 103-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Recently, we have mapped the PKA phosphorylation site on ezrin and demonstrated the importance of the phospho-regulation of ezrin in gastric acid secretion (7Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z.

Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) demonstrated that knockdown ezrin in stomachs to <5% of the wild-type levels results in severe achlorhydria. In these parietal cells, H,K-ATPase-containing tubulovesicles failed to fuse with the apical membrane, suggesting an essential role of ezrin in tubulovesicle docking. However, it is still not clear how ezrin links the apical targeting of H,K-ATPase-containing tubulovesicle to the remodeling of apical membrane and cytoskeleton during the parietal cell activation.ARF6 GTPase is a conserved regulator of membrane trafficking and actin-based cytoskeleton dynamics at the leading edge of migrating cells. A key determinant of ARF6 function is the lifetime of the GTP-bound active state, which is orchestrated by GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and GTP-GDP exchanging factor. Recent studies show that ARF6 is mainly located in the parietal cell within the gastric glands, and it relocates from the cytoplasm to the apical membrane of parietal cells upon stimulation of acid secretion (e.g. see Ref. 9Matsukawa J. Nakayama K. Nagao T. Ichijo H. Urushidani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36470-36475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Significantly, overexpression of ARF6Q67L, a mutant lacking GTP hydrolysis activity, in cultured gastric glands inhibits acid secretion. These results suggest that ARF6 regulates gastric acid secretion in parietal cells and that the GTP hydrolysis cycle of ARF6 is essential for the activation pathway. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying ARF6-mediated parietal cell secretion. Our recent proteomic study has identified a novel ARF6 GTPase-activating protein ACAP4 essential for volatile membrane remodeling during cell migration (10Fang Z. Miao Y. Ding X. Deng H. Liu S. Wang F. Zhou R. Watson C. Fu C. Hu Q. Lillard Jr., J.W. Powell M. Chen Y. Forte J.G. Yao X. Mol.

Our studies demonstrate that phosphorylation of ezrin at Ser66 is critical for parietal cell activation. To identify the downstream signal linking ezrin phosphorylation and tubulovesicle trafficking, we express phospho-mimicking ezrin and non-phosphorylatable ezrin in the cultured parietal cells and isolate a novel ezrin-binding protein, ACAP4. Our studies indicate that ezrin directly binds to ACAP4 in a Ser66 phosphorylation-dependent manner and specifies the apical localization of ACAP4 upon the parietal cell activation. Overexpression of non-phosphorylatable ezrin diminishes apical localization of ACAP4 and effects an inhibition in parietal cell activation. We propose that ACAP4-ezrin interaction provides a link between tubulovesicle trafficking and apical membrane reorganization in parietal cell activation.DISCUSSIONEzrin, a founding member of the membrane-cytoskeleton linker of the ezrin/radixin/moesin protein family, has been implicated in a variety of volatile membrane-cytoskeletal dynamics, including cell migration, immunological synapse formation, and regulated exocytosis (e.g. see Ref. 2Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Here we provide the first evidence that ezrin interacts with ACAP4, an ARF6 GTPase-activating protein containing a pleckstrin homology domain and ankyrin repeats (10Fang Z. Miao Y. Ding X. Deng H.

Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 1437-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although our early study revealed that ezrin-ACAP4 form a volatile membrane regulatory complex, their physical interaction was never demonstrated. ACAP4 binds to ezrin via its N-terminal 400 amino acids and is co-localized with ezrin to the apical membrane of secreting parietal cells. Furthermore, our studies show that Ser66-phosphorylated ezrin is essential for the apical localization of ACAP4 because either suppression of ezrin phosphorylation or deletion of the ezrin eliminates the apical targeting of ACAP4. Finally, our studies demonstrate the essential role of ezrin-ACAP4 interaction in the apical membrane remodeling associated with parietal cell secretion.An essential role for the actin cytoskeleton in the secretory processes of parietal cells has been inferred from studies using actin disruptors that disorganize actin filaments and act to inhibit acid secretion (22Berryman M. Franck Z. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1025-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Highly organized microfilaments are typical features of microvilli at the apical membrane within the parietal cell canaliculus. In going from the resting to the secreting state, there are major changes at the apical canalicular surface, including elongation of microvilli. Interestingly, as the parietal cell returns to the resting state after withdrawal of stimulants, microfilament ultrastructural changes become apparent as a disorganization of actin filaments along with collapse of the apical canalicular surface (25Forte T.M. Machen T.E. Forte J.G. Gastroenterology. 1977; 73: 941-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Black J.A. Forte T.M. Forte J.G. Gastroenterology. 1982; 83: 595-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These morphological studies indicate that reversible actin-based cytoskeletal dynamics are tightly linked to the secretory cycle in parietal cells. Gastric ezrin was initially identified as a PKA substrate associated with parietal cell acid secretion (28Forte J.G. Yao X. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 45-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Both cellular and animal experiments demonstrated the essential role of ezrin in gastric acid secretion (7Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Tamura A. Kikuchi S. Hata M. Katsuno T. Matsui T. Hayashi H. Suzuki Y. Noda T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S.

Our recent studies demonstrate that ezrin couples PKA-mediated phosphorylation to the remodeling of the apical membrane cytoskeleton associated with acid secretion in parietal cells (7Zhou R. Cao X.

However, knowledge of how ezrin operates H,K-ATPase trafficking upon the parietal cell activation by histamine stimulation has remained elusive.ARF6 GTPase is a conserved regulator of membrane trafficking and actin-based cytoskeleton dynamics at the leading edge of migrating cells. A key determinant of ARF6 function is the lifetime of the GTP-bound active state, which is orchestrated by GAP and GTP-GDP exchanging factor. To systematically analyze proteins that regulate ARF6 activity during volatile membrane dynamics, we performed a proteomic analysis of proteins selectively bound to active ARF6 using mass spectrometry and identified a novel ARF6 complex containing PALS1, calpain, ezrin, and ACAP4. ACAP4 encodes 903 amino acids and contains two coiled coils, one pleckstrin homology domain, one GAP motif, and two ankyrin repeats. Our biochemical characterization demonstrated that ACAP4 has a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-dependent GAP activity specific for ARF6. The co-localization of ACAP4 with ARF6 occurred in ruffling membranes formed upon epidermal growth factor stimulation. Significantly, the depletion of ACAP4 by small interfering RNA or inhibition of ARF6 GTP hydrolysis by overexpressing GAP-deficient ACAP4 suppressed cell migration in wound healing, demonstrating the importance of ACAP4 in volatile membrane-cytoskeleton remodeling.Our present study shows that phospho-Ser66 provides a spatiotemporal cue for tubulovesicle membrane trafficking to the apical membrane via a site-specific phosphorylation-dependent ezrin-ACAP4 interaction. It is worth noting that ezrin is an interacting protein of the regulatory subunit of PKA that is implicated in the apical localization of PKA (29Urushidani T. Hanzel D.K. Forte J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 930: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between phosphoezrin and ACAP4 established here may organize an apical signaling complex that orchestrates membrane recruitment and membrane cytoskeletal reorganization. Precise mapping of respective binding interfaces between these three proteins will aid in delineating the molecular mechanisms underlying polarity establishment and/or maintenance in gastric parietal cells. In addition, it would be of great interest to visualize the PKA spatiotemporal dynamics of parietal cells in response to histamine stimulation.Our early study showed that WWOX interacts with ezrin via the polyproline region located at the C terminus of ezrin and is required for gastric parietal cell secretion (12Jin C. Ge L. Ding X. Chen Y. Zhu H. Ward T. Wu F. Cao X. Wang Q. Yao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although both WWOX and ACAP4 interact with ezrin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and are required for parietal cell activation, they interact with ezrin via different regions and function at different steps of parietal cell activation. In addition, those two proteins interact with different structures of ezrin. Our preliminary studies suggest that ACAP4-ezrin interaction is essential for tubulovesicle docking to the apical membrane, whereas WWOX functions as a priming step for fusion of the tubulovesicle membrane with the apical plasma membrane. 4X. Ding and X. Yao, unpublished observation. It would be of great interest to apply supraresolution microscopy, such as photoactivated localization microscopy, to visualize how WWOX and ACAP4 molecules facilitate the apical membrane remodeling underlying parietal cell activation.Parietal cell activation involves translocation of H,K-ATPase from the cytoplasm to the apical plasma membrane via multiple steps, including the possible trafficking over actin filaments, docking to secretory sites, insertion of the pump into the apical membrane, and perhaps maintenance of the pump in the apical membrane during active secretion. Recent studies show that ARF6 regulates gastric acid secretion in parietal cells and that the GTP hydrolysis cycle of ARF6 is essential for the activation pathway (9Matsukawa J. Nakayama K. Nagao T. Ichijo H. Urushidani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36470-36475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear at that time how ARF6 translocates to the apical secretory membrane upon stimulation. Our studies suggest that ARF6-ACAP4-ezrin may constitute an apical signaling complex that coordinates the respective roles of actin-based cytoskeleton and membrane fusion machinery in mediating H,K-ATPase translocation to the apical membrane, it remains to be established how ARF6-ACAP4-ezrin interaction operates the apical membrane cytoskeletal dynamics to facilitate the docking and insertion of H,K-ATPase to the apical membrane of parietal cells for proton pumping. In this regard, molecular illustration of PKA kinase gradient and ARF6 activation dynamics during parietal cell activation will facilitate a better understanding of gastric parietal cell physiology.Phosphorylation of ezrin has been functionally linked to membrane dynamics and plasticity. Our previous study demonstrated that phosphorylation of the conserved Thr567 residue of ezrin alters the physiology of gastric parietal cells (30Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We have recently established a protocol in which phosphorylation-mediated protein conformational change can be studied at the single molecule level (31Liu D. Ge L. Wang F. Takahashi H. Wang D. Guo Z. Yoshimura S. Ward T. Ding X. Takeyasu K. Yao X. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using this protocol, we have correlated phosphorylation-induced conformational change of ezrin-Thr567 with its functional activity in cellular localization. Using the same protocol, our preliminary study shows that phosphorylation of ezrin at Ser66 also unfolds ezrin intramolecular association. Although Thr567 phosphorylation retains the N-terminal globular domain of ezrin half-folded (31Liu D. Ge L. Wang F. Takahashi H. Wang D. Guo Z. Yoshimura S. Ward T. Ding X. Takeyasu K. Yao X. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), Ser66 phosphorylation fully extends the ezrin molecule. Precise comparative analyses are under way to provide a molecular illustration of phosphorylation-elicited functional activation of ezrin and delineate how stimulus-induced protein conformational change is used as a signaling mechanism orchestrating cellular dynamics.Taken together, the present work reveals that phosphoezrin interacts with an ARF6 GTPase-activating protein, ACAP4, and that this interaction specifies the apical localization of ACAP4. Finally, we show that disruption of ezrin-ACAP4 interaction blocks the remodeling of the apical membrane cytoskeleton associated with the translocation and insertion of H,K-ATPase to the apical membrane. We propose that ACAP4-ezrin interaction links proton pump H,K-ATPase trafficking to apical membrane- cytoskeletal remodeling required for polarized secretion in gastric parietal cells. IntroductionThe functions of an epithelium depend on the polarized organization of its individual epithelial cells. The acquisition of a fully polarized phenotype involves a cascade of complex events, including cell-cell adhesion, assembly of a lateral cortical complex, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and polarized targeting of transport vesicles to the apical and basolateral membranes (1Yeaman C.

Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Within the gastric epithelium, ezrin has been localized exclusively to parietal cells and primarily to the apical canalicular membrane of these cells (e.g. see Refs. 3Urushidani T. Hanzel D.K.

Our previous studies showed that gastric ezrin is co-distributed with the β-actin isoform in vivo (5Yao X. Chaponnier C. Gabbiani G. Forte J.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and preferentially bound to the β-actin isoform in vitro (6Yao X. Cheng L. Forte J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7224-7229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because of its cytolocalization and observed stimulation-dependent phosphorylation, it was postulated that ezrin couples the activation of protein kinase A (PKA) 3The abbreviations used are: PKAprotein kinase AGAPGTPase-activating proteinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMEMminimal essential mediumSLOStreptolysin OAPaminopyrinePIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)PBSphosphate-buffered salineIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthinesiRNAsmall interfering RNAGSTglutathione S-transferaseMBPmaltose-binding protein. to the apical membrane remodeling associated with parietal cell secretion (e.g. see Ref. 4Yao X. Forte J.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 103-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Recently, we have mapped the PKA phosphorylation site on ezrin and demonstrated the importance of the phospho-regulation of ezrin in gastric acid secretion (7Zhou R. Cao X. Watson C. Miao Y. Guo Z. Forte J.G. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35651-35659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Using mouse genetics, Tamura et al. (8Tamura A. Kikuchi S. Hata M. Katsuno T. Matsui T. Hayashi H. Suzuki Y. Noda T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) demonstrated that knockdown ezrin in stomachs to <5% of the wild-type levels results in severe achlorhydria. In these parietal cells, H,K-ATPase-containing tubulovesicles failed to fuse with the apical membrane, suggesting an essential role of ezrin in tubulovesicle docking. However, it is still not clear how ezrin links the apical targeting of H,K-ATPase-containing tubulovesicle to the remodeling of apical membrane and cytoskeleton during the parietal cell activation.ARF6 GTPase is a conserved regulator of membrane trafficking and actin-based cytoskeleton dynamics at the leading edge of migrating cells. A key determinant of ARF6 function is the lifetime of the GTP-bound active state, which is orchestrated by GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and GTP-GDP exchanging factor. Recent studies show that ARF6 is mainly located in the parietal cell within the gastric glands, and it relocates from the cytoplasm to the apical membrane of parietal cells upon stimulation of acid secretion (e.g. see Ref. 9Matsukawa J. Nakayama K. Nagao T. Ichijo H. Urushidani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36470-36475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Significantly, overexpression of ARF6Q67L, a mutant lacking GTP hydrolysis activity, in cultured gastric glands inhibits acid secretion. These results suggest that ARF6 regulates gastric acid secretion in parietal cells and that the GTP hydrolysis cycle of ARF6 is essential for the activation pathway. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying ARF6-mediated parietal cell secretion. Our recent proteomic study has identified a novel ARF6 GTPase-activating protein ACAP4 essential for volatile membrane remodeling during cell migration (10Fang Z. Miao Y. Ding X. Deng H. Liu S. Wang F. Zhou R. Watson C. Fu C. Hu Q. Lillard Jr., J.W. Powell M. Chen Y. Forte J.G. Yao X. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 1437-1449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).To delineate the molecular function of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of ezrin in parietal cell secretion, we took advantage of our recent development of Streptolysin O-permeabilized gastric glands and assessed the requirement of phosphorylation of ezrin in parietal cell activation by the addition of recombinant ezrin and its mutants. Our studies demonstrate that phosphorylation of ezrin at Ser66 is critical for parietal cell activation. To identify the downstream signal linking ezrin phosphorylation and tubulovesicle trafficking, we express phospho-mimicking ezrin and non-phosphorylatable ezrin in the cultured parietal cells and isolate a novel ezrin-binding protein, ACAP4. Our studies indicate that ezrin directly binds to ACAP4 in a Ser66 phosphorylation-dependent manner and specifies the apical localization of ACAP4 upon the parietal cell activation. Overexpression of non-phosphorylatable ezrin diminishes apical localization of ACAP4 and effects an inhibition in parietal cell activation. We propose that ACAP4-ezrin interaction provides a link between tubulovesicle trafficking and apical membrane reorganization in parietal cell activation."

Activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in Schwann cells has been suggested to be critical for these cells to differentiate into a myelinating phenotype; however, the mechanisms by which it is activated have yet to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that axonal membranes are sufficient to promote NF-κB activation in cultured Schwann cells and identify neuregulin 1 (NRG1), specifically the membrane-bound type III isoform, as the signal responsible for activating this transcription factor. Surprisingly, neither membrane-bound type I nor the soluble NRG1 EGF domain could activate NF-κB, indicating that type III induces a qualitatively unique signal. The transcriptional activity of NF-κB was significantly enhanced by treatment with forskolin, indicating these two signals converge for maximal activation. Both ErbB2 and -3 receptors were required for transducing the NRG1 signal, because gene deletion of ErbB3 in Schwann cells or treatment with the ErbB2 selective inhibitor, PKI-166, prevented the stimulation of NF-κB by axonal membranes. Finally, PKI-166 blocked the activation of the transcription factor in myelinating neuron/Schwann cell co-cultures and in vivo, in developing sciatic nerves.

https://openalex.org/W2025818509,"The Rac exchange factor Tiam1 is involved in diverse cell functions and signaling pathways through multiple protein interactions, raising the question of how signaling and functional specificity are achieved. We have shown that Tiam1 interactions with different scaffold proteins activate different Rac-dependent pathways by recruiting specific Rac effector proteins, and reasoned that there must be regulatory mechanisms governing each interaction. Fibroblasts express at least two Tiam1-interacting proteins, insulin receptor substrate protein 53 kDa (IRSp53) and spinophilin. We used fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure localized Rac activation associated with IRSp53 and spinophilin complexes in individual fibroblasts to test this hypothesis. Pervanadate or platelet-derived growth factor induced localized Rac activation dependent on Tiam1 and IRSp53. Forskolin or epinephrine induced localized Rac activation dependent on Tiam1 and spinophilin. In spinophilin-deficient cells, Tiam1 co-localized with IRSp53 in response to pervanadate or platelet-derived growth factor. In IRSp53-deficient cells, Tiam1 co-localized with spinophilin in response to forskolin or epinephrine. Total cellular levels of activated Rac were affected only in cells with exogenous Tiam1, and were primarily increased in the membrane fraction. Downstream effects of Rac activation were also stimulus and scaffold-specific. Cell ruffling, spreading, and cell adhesion were dependent on IRSp53, but not spinophilin. Epinephrine decreased IRSp53-dependent adhesion and increased cell migration in a Rac and spinophilin-dependent fashion. These results support the idea that Tiam1 interactions with different scaffold proteins couple distinct upstream signals to localized Rac activation and specific downstream pathways, and suggest that manipulating Tiam1-scaffold interactions can modulate Rac-dependent cellular behaviors.

The Rac GTPase influences a diverse set of cellular functions in cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Burridge K. Wennerberg K. Cell. 2004; 116: 167-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Like other members of the Ras family of monomeric GTPases, Rac becomes activated through exchange of bound GDP for GTP, undergoing a conformational change that allows it to bind to a large number of downstream target proteins (2Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). The wide range of potential Rac effector pathways raises the question of how cells maintain signaling specificity in pathways involving Rac and other Ras superfamily members. Activation of Rac is catalyzed by a number of guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (3Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Tiam1 is a ubiquitous exchange factor for the Rac GTPase that also participates in multiple signaling pathways, leading to effects on a variety of cell behaviors (4Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H.

The physiologic significance has been established for some but not all of these interactions. Many of these interactions, including CD44, ankyrin, JIP/IB proteins, spinophilin, IRSp53, and Par3 are mediated through the same relatively limited N-terminal region containing a pleckstrin homology domain immediately upstream of a coiled-coil region. There is no commonly identified Tiam1-binding motif on the different Tiam1 interactors and how all these interactions with the same region of Tiam1 are regulated is not known.

We have previously found that some of these proteins, including JIP2/IB2, spinophilin, and IRSp53, serve as scaffold proteins for Rac signaling, in that they form complexes with both the Rac exchange factor as well as with specific Rac effector proteins (7Buchsbaum R.J. Connolly B.A. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4073-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 8Buchsbaum R.J. Connolly B.A. Feig L.A. J. Biol.

Our results have led us to propose that interactions of exchange factor with such scaffold proteins govern Tiam1 and Rac signaling specificity by directing the effects of Tiam1-activated Rac to specific downstream effector pathways. This mechanism would be particularly important in cells or cellular compartments where more than one Tiam1 interactor is expressed. Some Tiam1-interacting proteins have restricted tissue or cell type expression, such as JIP/IB proteins, N-methyl-d-asparatate receptor, and TrkB in neuronal cells, CD44v3 in breast cancer cells, and Par3 in epithelial cells. However, spinophilin and IRSp53 are ubiquitously expressed proteins that are both present at the plasma membranes of cells and are both major Tiam1 interacting proteins present in fibroblasts (reviewed in Refs. 18Sarrouilhe D. di Tommaso A. Métayé T. Ladeveze V. Biochimie. 2006; 88: 1099-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar and 19Scita G. Confalonieri S. Lappalainen P. Suetsugu S. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 52-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Rac signaling is a critical component in the biology of human tumors, in both the transformed cells as well as the cells of the tumor microenvironment. Fibroblasts are the most abundant cell type within the tumor microenvironment. In this study we have looked at the role of Tiam1-interacting scaffold proteins in mediating input signals from upstream sources such as extracellular stimuli. By examining activation of localized pools of Rac in individual cells we have found that an individual scaffold protein facilitates Tiam1-dependent Rac activation in response to a limited set of upstream signals. This is then tied to activation of a specific downstream Rac effector pathway relevant to protein complexes mediated by the specific scaffold protein. This allows us to conclude that the presence of multiple Tiam1-interacting scaffold proteins allows for finely controlled Rac activation in response to a range of stimuli, leading to a range of specifically regulated cellular responses. NIH3T3 cells were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone) along with penicillin and streptomycin in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. The day prior to transfection, cells were plated in antibiotic-free medium onto 12-mm coverslips coated with either 10 μg/ml of poly-l-lysine or 100 μg/ml of fibronectin (Sigma) in 24-well culture plates at 5 × 104 cells/well. Cells were cotransfected with the pmCFP-Rac1 species (WT, V12, N17, or C40, 2 μg/well) and pmYFP-PBD using Lipofectomine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Eighteen h after transfection cells were deprived of serum for 5 h, and then some were stimulated as indicated with 200 μm pervanadate for 10 min, 10 ng/ml of PDGF for 10 min, 50 μmol of forskolin for 15 min, 10 μmol of epinephrine for 15 min, or 200 mmol of H2O2 for 30 min, respectively. Some cells were treated with 100 μmol of the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 (Calbiochem) for 16 h before analysis. At the end of the stimulation, cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with fixative solution (3% paraformaldehyde, 0.2 ml-lysine, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 40% sucrose, 21.4 mg of sodium periodate). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides in the presence of Antifade (Bio-Rad). For replating experiments, cells plated on glass coverslips were trypsinized briefly at room temperature until completely rounded, and then serum-containing medium was added to the wells to neutralize the trypsin. Morphology was monitored over time under light microscopy, and the numbers of cells exhibiting rounded or spread morphology were counted at serial time points after replating. NIH3T3 cell lines with stable expression of short hairpin RNAs targeting Tiam1, Spinophilin, and IRSp53 were generated using the pSuperior.retro.neo retroviral shRNA expression vector (OligoEngine). Silencing hairpins were cloned into the pSuperior vector using double-stranded oligomers synthesized in the Tufts DNA Core Facility (Tiam1) or OligoEngine (Spinophilin and IRSp53). Hairpins were derived from the following template sequences: Tiam1, 5′-GAGACTCCTCCGTACAGTAAT; Spinophilin, 5′-AAAGCTGGTGCACAAGTTC; and IRSp53, 5′-CTCGTACTCCAACACACTC. A control line was generated using the pSuperior.retro.neo vector itself. For virus production murine amphotropic 293 cells were transfected with 30 μg of DNA each of the appropriate retroviral construct along with Ecopac viral packaging cDNA using standard calcium phosphate precipitation. Cultured supernatants containing virus were collected after 48 h and filtered. Recipient NIH3T3 cells were plated overnight at a cell density of 8 × 104/ml in 6-cm plates, infected with the filtered viral supernatants in the presence of Polybrene solution (8 μg/ml, Sigma), and infected with a second round of fresh viral supernatants 24 h later. Infected NIH3T3 cells were selected for 7 days in growth medium containing 100 μg/ml of gentamycin (Invitrogen). Single colony isolates were then tested for loss of protein by immunoblot or real time PCR analysis. DNA constructs of pmCFP-Rac1WT, pmCFP-Rac1V12, pmCFP-Rac1N17, pmCFP-Rac1C40, and pmYFP-PBD were generated as described (20Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, using PCR standard molecular cloning techniques, human cDNAs from plasmids pCGT-Rac1, pCGT-Rac1V12, and pCGT-Rac1N17 were fused into the multicloning site downstream of the 3′ end of CFP in pmECFP to generate the respective cDNAs in pmECFP. The Rac1Y40C was created by site-directed mutagenesis of pmCFP-Rac1WT. Human cDNA sequence corresponding to the Cdc42-Rac binding domain from pCMVM-Pak1 was inserted in the multicloning site at the 3′ end of YFP in pmEYFP to generate the pmYFP-PBD plasmid. To generate shRNA-resistant plasmids for rescue of gene silencing, full-length cDNAs were cloned into pmCherry (Clontech) or pRSET-B-mCherry (21Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E. Steinbach P.A. Giepmans B.N. Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar) to generate fluorescent fusion proteins with far-red emission spectra that do not overlap with CFP and YFP. Overlap PCR was used to generate full-length cDNAs with silent mutations as follows: Tiam*, 5′-GAAACTCCACCATACAGCAAT; Spinophilin*, 5′-AAGCTAGTACATAAATTC; and (human) IRSp53*, 5′-CTCCTACTCCAACACACTC. Gene silencing of IRSp53 in NIH3T3 cells was serially monitored by real time PCR analysis. Total RNA and first strand cDNA synthesis were carried out using the TRIzolTM and SuperScriptTM (Invitrogen) protocols, respectively. PCR were performed as duplicates in 15-μl volumes containing cDNA, SYBR® Green PCR Mastermix (Applied Biosystems), and specific primers as follows: sense 5′-gTgTCAggCTgAgCTgAAgA; antisense 5′-TggAATggTAAgCAgCAgAg. Cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min followed by 45 amplification cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s). Data analysis was done using a OpticonTM 2 Continuous Fluorescence Detector (MJ Research). Fold-knockdown for cDNA was normalized to β-actin cDNA in the sample (actin primers 5′-TggAATCCTgTggCATCCATgAAAC and 5′-TAAAACgCAgCTCAgTAACAgTCCg). Fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) was detected as previously described (20Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300) and the following filter sets: CFP, D436/10x (excitation), 455DCLP (beam splitter), D480/40m (emission); YFP, HQ500/20x (excitation), Q515LP (beam splitter), HQ535/30m (emission); FRET, D436/10x (excitation), 455DCLP (beam splitter), HQ535/30m (emission). Images were captured using a Hamamatsu Orca II camera, with scripts controlled by IPLab Spectrum software, capturing the YFP, CFP, and FRET channels at a bin setting of 2 × 2 with 200-ms exposure time. For each experimental condition, cells expressing similar levels of CFP and YFP (average intensity ∼500 fluorescence units) were picked for analysis. Four regions of interest were chosen randomly from each cell, with two regions of interest located in the non-nuclear interior of the cell and two at the cell periphery. The CFP, YFP, and FRET images from each cell were corrected for background. Sensitized FRET was calculated as described (22Wong K.W. Mohammadi S. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35954-35965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in Equation 1, Isensitized FRET=IFRET-(0.27×ICFP)-(0.22×IYFP)(Eq. 1) where IFRET, ICFP, and IYFP are the mean intensities of each region of interest in the FRET, CFP, and YFP images, respectively, and correction norms for bleed-through were derived by analyzing cells expressing CFP or YFP only in the appropriate channels (0.27 for CFP and 0.22 for YFP). For derivation of normalized FRET, sensitized FRET values were normalized to the square root of the (CFP·YFP) product to control for molecular concentration and cell thickness within regions of interest, as described (23Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Normalized FRET ratios are calculated as mean normalized FRET (periphery) divided by mean normalized FRET (interior). Affinity precipitation for active Rac species was performed as previously described (8Buchsbaum R.J. Connolly B.A. Feig L.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, cleared lysates of cells transiently expressing equal amounts of total protein were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with S-hexyl-glutathione-agarose beads loaded with the p21-binding domain of PAK1 expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion in Escherichia coli (24Bagrodia S.

Precipitates were washed, and bound proteins were eluted in 4× Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. Equal amounts of cleared lysate were also resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted in parallel to verify equivalent Rac expression. Cell fractionation was performed as previously described (25Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, along with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml of aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 μm sodium fluoride and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates cleared of nuclear debris and non-broken cells by low-speed centrifugation then underwent high-speed centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min). After recovery of the soluble (cytosolic) fraction, pellets were resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with 2% Nonidet P-40 and 10% glycerol to release membrane fractions. Equivalent protein loading was verified by the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Tiam1-scaffold protein localization experiments, 1.5 × 105 cells were plated onto 12-mm glass coverslips coated with 100 μg/ml of fibronectin in 24-well culture plates. Cells were serum starved for 5 h and some were stimulated with pervanadate, PDGF, forskolin, or epinephrine as indicated prior to fixation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Triton X-100, and incubated with antibodies as previously described (9Connolly B.A. Rice J. Feig L.A. Buchsbaum R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4602-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For detection of actin localization, cells were replated on uncoated glass coverslips prior to fixation and permeabilized with buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Phalloidin Alexa Fluor 546 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (both from Molecular Probes), and polyclonal anti-Tiam1 antibody (Santa Cruz) were diluted per the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-β actin IgG was affinity purified and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline prior to use as previously published (26DeNofrio D. Hoock T.C. Herman I.M. J.

Coverslips were mounted using Antifade (Bio-Rad). Cells were observed under ×63 magnification using an Axioplasm Zeiss microsocope, and images were obtained using a Retiga 2000R imaging camera. Antibodies to Tiam1, spinophilin, IRSp53, β-actin, and myc epitope, secondary antibodies, immunoblotting, and chemiluminescence protocols have been described previously (8Buchsbaum R.J.

Cultured cells were deprived of serum overnight, trypsinized, and plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml (5 × 104 cells/basket) in the upper basket of transwell chambers with a filter pore size of 8 μm (Costar). Cells were incubated for 4–5 h at 37 °C and allowed to migrate toward the lower chambers containing either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone or supplemented with 25% filter-sterilized conditioned NIH3T3. Non-migrated cells were removed using a cotton swab. Migrated cells were fixed and stained using the Protocol 3®HEMA Stain kit (Fisher). Filters were cut out and mounted on glass slides under coverslips using Immersion oil (Resolve®, Richard Allen Scientific). Cell migration was determined by counting migrated cells in nine random fields using a Zeiss microscope and ×16 objective. Where indicated, epinephrine was added at a concentration of 10 μmol 1 h after placing cells in the upper basket. We have previously found that Tiam1 interaction with different scaffold proteins leads to activation of specific pathways downstream of Rac. Tiam1 is known to interact with a number of different proteins and many of these interactions are mediated through the same N-terminal region of the protein, which contains a pleckstrin homology domain immediately followed by a coiled-coil domain (28Mertens A.E. Roovers R.C. Collard J.G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This raises the question of how signaling specificity is achieved. We reasoned that there must be regulatory mechanisms governing the specific conditions under which each interaction occurs. In particular, whereas some Tiam1 interacting proteins are localized to specific tissues or intracellular compartments, others exhibit generalized expression throughout multiple tissues, suggesting that specific upstream stimuli favor the interaction of Tiam1 with one interacting protein over another. Tiam1 itself is known to translocate between different cellular compartments in response to different stimuli (29Fleming I.N. Batty I.H. Prescott A.R. Gray A. Kular G.S. Stewart H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Downes C.P. Gray A. Fairservice A. Safrany S.T. Batty I.H. Fleming I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1303-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that the interactions of Tiam1 with multiple different scaffold proteins couple the transmission of distinct upstream signals to Rac activation and subsequent activation of specific downstream pathways. We reasoned that Tiam1 interaction with one scaffold complex might lead to Tiam1-mediated Rac activation in response to one upstream signal, whereas interaction with another scaffold complex would lead to Tiam1-mediated Rac activation in response to another upstream signal, thereby leading to activation of different subcellular pools of Rac in association with different Tiam1-interacting scaffold proteins. To begin to test this hypothesis we therefore took advantage of a system developed to examine localized Rac activation in single cells. The binding of activated, GTP-bound Rac, to the p21-binding domain of Pak (PBD) can be visualized by FRET between Rac and PBD when Rac and PBD are each expressed as fusion proteins with suitable donor and acceptor fluorophores (in this case CFP and YFP, respectively) (20Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 31Kraynov V.S. Chamberlain C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M.

Measuring Rac-FRET by this method allows for detection of activation of small populations of Rac molecules at a specific place and time in an individual cell. We first determined that we could detect FRET signals reliably using established controls with known effects on Rac signaling. We found that the FRET signals were too weak to consistently measure using confocal imaging, so signals were recorded using an inverted microscope as previously reported (20Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Little to no increase in non-nuclear FRET signals was seen in cells expressing wild-type Rac fused with CFP (CFP-RacWT) along with YFP-PBD (Fig. 1, A, lane 1, and B, top panels). Cells expressing the dominant active Rac mutant, CFP-RacV12, which resists hydrolysis of bound GTP, and YFP-PBD exhibited localized areas of increased FRET at or near the periphery of the cell, in comparison to cells expressing wild-type CFP-Rac (Fig. 1, A, compare lane 1 to lane 2, and B, second row panels). In addition, an NIH3T3 line stably expressing the constitutively active C1199 mutant of Tiam1 also exhibited elevated FRET when transfected with CFP-Rac and YFP-PBD, in comparison to parental cells with endogenous wild-type Tiam1 (Fig. 1, A, compare lane 1 to lane 3, and B, third row panels). No increase in RacFRET was seen in cells expressing the dominant-negative CFP-RacN17, which binds GDP preferentially over GTP (Fig. 1, A, compare lane 1 to lane 4, and B, fourth row panels). In addition, no increase in RacFRET was detected with the effector mutant CFP-RacC40, which does not bind to PBD, indicating that FRET signals seen with wild-type Rac and PBD represent specific binding between Rac and PBD and not nonspecific dimerization of fluorophore moieties (Fig. 1, A, lane 5, and B, fifth row panels). We have previously shown that photobleaching of YFP-PBD leads to increases in CFP emission in cells co-transfected with CFP-RacWT and YFP-PBD, or in cells co-transfected with CFP-RacV12 and YFP-PBD, but not in cells co-transfected with either CFP-RacN17 or CFP-RacC40 and YFP-PBD (20Wong K.W. Isberg R.R. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), further supporting the conclusion that we are detecting specific binding of Rac-GTP to YFP-PBD by this method. We then determined that we could detect Rac activation using this method in response to an upstream stimulus. Published reports and our own work (not shown) suggest that treatment of cells with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate leads to phosphorylation of Tiam1 on tyrosine and activation of pathways downstream of Rac (33Servitja J.M. Marinissen M.J. Sodhi A. Bustelo X.R. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34339-34346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We found that in NIH3T3 cells expressing CFP-Rac and YFP-PBD, localized areas of increased RacFRET could be seen at the cell periphery within minutes after treatment with pervanadate, peaking at 10 min and largely disappearing after 20 min (Fig. 2, A, compare lanes 1 and 2, B, compare second row with first row FRET panels). Treatment of the cells with a cell-permeable Rac inhibitor designed to interfere with Rac activation by exchange factors (34Gao Y. Dickerson J.B. Guo F. Zheng J. Zheng Y. Proc. Natl. Acad."

Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy 1 (cDM1), a multi-system disorder is characterized by both cognitive deficits and a spectrum of behavioral abnormalities, which include visuo-spatial memory deficits, anxiety and apathy. Decreased levels of DMPK (Dystrophia Myotonica-protein kinase), SIX5, a transcription factor or MBNL1 (Muscleblind-like 1), an RNA splice regulator have been demonstrated to contribute to distinct features of cDM1. Mouse strains in which either Dmpk, Six5 or Mbnl1 are inactivated were therefore studied to determine the relative contribution of each gene to these cognitive functions. The open field and elevated plus maze tasks were used to examine anxiety, sucrose consumption was used to assess motivation, whereas the water maze and context fear conditioning were used to examine spatial learning and memory. Cognitive and behavioral abnormalities were observed only in Mbnl1 deficient mice, which demonstrate behavior consistent with motivational deficits in the Morris water maze, a complex visuo-spatial task and in the sucrose consumption test for anhedonia. All three models of cDM1 exhibit normal spatial learning and memory. These data identify MBNL1 as a potential regulator of emotional state with decreased MBNL1 levels underlying the motivational deficits observed in cDM1."
https://openalex.org/W2002530130,"Sinking Sea Floors The depths of ocean bottoms are constantly fluctuating at a very slow rate in response to the generation (at mid-ocean ridges) and consumption (at subduction zones) of sea-floor material. Because older sea floor is susceptible to sinking as it cools, it has been assumed that sea-floor depth varies directly with its age. However, Adam and Vidal (p. 83 ; see the Perspective by Tolstoy ) now show that the depth of the Pacific Ocean actually varies in response to the mantle underlying the oceanic crust. This effect is clear when sea-floor depth was measured along lithospheric flow lines—which represent the movement of oceanic crust triggered by mantle convection. Because the ocean bottom does not flatten as predicted by previous models, there is no need to invoke any additional heat supply to sustain old oceanic crust in thermal models of the mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2159301017,"Septins, novel cytoskeletal proteins, form rings at the bases of emerging round buds in yeasts and at the bases of emerging elongated hyphal initials in filamentous fungi.When introduced into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the septin AspC from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans induced highly elongated atypical pseudohyphae and spore-producing structures similar to those of hyphal fungi. AspC induced atypical pseudohyphae when S. cerevisiae pseudohyphal or haploid invasive genes were deleted, but not when the CDC10 septin gene was deleted. AspC also induced atypical pseudohyphae when S. cerevisiae genes encoding Cdc12-interacting proteins Bem4, Cla4, Gic1 and Gic2 were deleted, but not when BNI1, a Cdc12-interacting formin gene, was deleted. AspC localized to bud and pseudohypha necks, while its S. cerevisiae ortholog, Cdc12, localized only to bud necks.Our results suggest that AspC competes with Cdc12 for incorporation into the yeast septin scaffold and once there alters cell shape by altering interactions with the formin Bni1. That introduction of the A. nidulans septin AspC into S. cerevisiae induces a shift from formation of buds to formation of atypical pseudohyphae suggests that septins play an important role in the morphological plasticity of fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2017900394,"Several recent studies have indicated that transcription is pervasive in regions outside of protein coding genes and that short antisense transcripts can originate from the promoter and terminator regions of genes. Here we investigate transcription of fragments longer than 200 nucleotides, focusing on antisense transcription for known protein coding genes and intergenic transcription. We find that roughly 12% to 16% of all reads that originate from promoter and terminator regions, respectively, map antisense to the gene in question. Furthermore, we detect a high number of novel transcriptionally active regions (TARs) that are generally expressed at a lower level than protein coding genes. We find that the correlation between RNA-seq data and microarray data is dependent on the gene length, with longer genes showing a better correlation. We detect high antisense transcriptional activity from promoter, terminator and intron regions of protein-coding genes and identify a vast number of previously unidentified TARs, including putative novel EGFR transcripts. This shows that in-depth analysis of the transcriptome using RNA-seq is a valuable tool for understanding complex transcriptional events. Furthermore, the development of new algorithms for estimation of gene expression from RNA-seq data is necessary to minimize length bias."
https://openalex.org/W2005269300,"RecD2 from Deinococcus radiodurans is a superfamily 1 DNA helicase that is homologous to the Escherichia coli RecD protein but functions outside the context of RecBCD enzyme. We report here on the kinetics of DNA unwinding by RecD2 under single and multiple turnover conditions. There is little unwinding of 20-bp substrates by preformed RecD2-dsDNA complexes when excess ssDNA is present to trap enzyme molecules not bound to the substrate. A shorter 12-bp substrate is unwound rapidly under single turnover conditions. The 12-bp unwinding reaction could be simulated with a mechanism in which the DNA is unwound in two kinetic steps with rate constant of kunw = 5.5 s−1 and a dissociation step from partially unwound DNA of koff = 1.9 s−1. These results indicate a kinetic step size of about 3–4 bp, unwinding rate of about 15–20 bp/s, and low processivity (p = 0.74). The reaction time courses with 20-bp substrates, determined under multiple turnover conditions, could be simulated with a four-step mechanism and rate constant values very similar to those for the 12-bp substrate. The results indicate that the faster unwinding of a DNA substrate with a forked end versus only a 5′-terminal single-stranded extension can be accounted for by a difference in the rate of enzyme binding to the DNA substrates. Analysis of reactions done with different RecD2 concentrations indicates that the enzyme forms an inactive dimer or other oligomer at high enzyme concentrations.

Deinococcus radiodurans is a Gram-positive bacterium that is extremely resistant to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, oxidants, and dessication. It is widely studied as a model for organisms that are highly resistant to these agents, and for general understanding of how these agents affect living organisms. There has been much recent work on the physiological attributes, enzymes, and enzymatic pathways that contribute to its extraordinary ability to survive under extreme conditions (reviewed in Refs. 1Cox M.M.

Nature. 2006; 443: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The enzymatic machinery that it uses to repair DSBs is not fully understood. DSB repair in E. coli and other bacteria requires the RecBCD helicase/nuclease to initiate the repair by processing broken DNA ends and loading the RecA recombinase (6Kowalczykowski S.C.

Interestingly, D. radiodurans does have a homologue of the RecD subunit of the RecBCD enzyme found in Escherichia coli and other bacteria (10White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K.

Sequence analysis shows that the D. radiodurans RecD shares with the RecD subunits seven short amino acid motifs that are conserved in Superfamily 1 (SF1) DNA and RNA helicases (13Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52024-52032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the D. radiodurans protein is larger than that from E. coli, with an N-terminal extension whose amino acid sequence is poorly conserved. For this reason, the D. radiodurans RecD protein, and close protein relatives found in a number of other bacteria, have been named RecD2 (14Rocha E.P. Cornet E. Michel B. PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The in vivo function of D. radiodurans RecD2 is not clear, but recD2 mutant cells are 100–1000 times more sensitive than wild type to the cytotoxic effect of UV light, gamma irradiation, and hydrogen peroxide (15Servinsky M.D. Julin D.A.

The purified D. radiodurans RecD2 protein is a DNA helicase capable of efficient unwinding of 20-bp DNA duplexes with a 5′ single-stranded extension at least 10 nt in length, or with a forked end (13Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52024-52032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It thus has 5′-3′ polarity and has been placed in the SF1B helicase family (18Saikrishnan K. Griffiths S.P. Cook N. Court R. Wigley D.B. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The protein appeared to have low processivity, because longer DNAs (52 or 76 bp) were unwound much less efficiently than the 20-bp substrates (13Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52024-52032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of RecD2 has been determined, as the free enzyme (18Saikrishnan K. Griffiths S.P. Cook N. Court R. Wigley D.B. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), bound to ssDNA, and bound to ssDNA and an ATP analogue (19Saikrishnan K. Powell B. Cook N.J. Webb M.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2009; 137: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The structure is similar to that of E. coli RecD and other SF1 helicases. The enzyme was found to bind to 8 nt of ssDNA in a cleft in the protein, the end of which has a tyrosine residue proposed to act as a “pin” for strand separation during DNA unwinding. The structures led to a hypothesis for how a SF1 helicase can translocate in either the 3′-5′ direction on ssDNA, as in PcrA and UvrD, or in the 5′-3′ direction as in RecD2 (19Saikrishnan K. Powell B. Cook N.J. Webb M.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2009; 137: 849-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties of the RecD helicases have not been studied extensively. The E. coli RecD protein has DNA-dependent ATPase- and DNA-unwinding activities (20Chen H.W. Ruan B. Yu M. Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10072-10079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Dillingham M.S. Spies M. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 893-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), but it has poor solubility and has been difficult to study in isolation. The D. radiodurans RecD2 is soluble when expressed in E. coli and is relatively easy to purify (13Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52024-52032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For this reason, the D. radiodurans RecD2 is a good model for enzymatic study of this novel family of DNA helicases. We report here on measurements of the DNA-unwinding activity of the D. radiodurans RecD2 helicase under single and multiple turnover conditions. The results indicate that the enzyme is capable of rapid DNA unwinding. However, its processivity is quite low, such that complete unwinding under single turnover conditions is detected only with very short DNA duplexes. Synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT Corp. and were purified by passage over a P6 size exclusion spin column (Bio-Rad Corp.). Stock solutions of oligonucleotides were made in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and stored at −20 °C. The sequences of the DNA molecules used in this study are given in Table 1. ATP stock solutions were obtained from GE Healthcare.TABLE 1Oligodeoxyribonucleotides usedNameaThe helicase substrates are named according to the number of single-stranded nucleotides in the 5′-terminal extension, followed by the number of base pairs.SequenceT-GCCGTAGTATGCACATCGACHP1T| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |T-CGGCATCATACGTGTAGCTGATCCATCGACAT-5′20 nt:12 bp5′-GCCGTAGTATGCCGGCATCATACGTGTAGCTGATCCATCGACAT-5′12 nt:20 bp5′-GCCGTAGTATGCACATCGACCGGCATCATACGTGTAGCTGATCCATCGACAT-5′24 nt:20 bp5′-GCCGTAGTATGCACATCGACCGGCATCATACGTGTAGCTGATCCATCGACATATCCATCGACAT-5′ATCCATCGACATfork:20 bp5′-GCCGTAGTATGCACATCGACCGGCATCATACGTGTAGCTGATCCATCGACAT-5′a The helicase substrates are named according to the number of single-stranded nucleotides in the 5′-terminal extension, followed by the number of base pairs. Open table in a new tab D. radiodurans RecD2 was expressed with a C-terminal hexahistidine fusion tag in the vector pET21a (Novagen) using E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (13Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52024-52032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C with vigorous shaking overnight in 50 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. This culture was inoculated into 1 liter of ZYP-5052 medium (1% bacto-tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1 mm MgSO4, 25 mm (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm KH2PO4, 50 mm Na2HPO4, 2.8 mm dextrose, 5.8 mm lactose, and 0.5% glycerol, with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) for autoinduction of RecD2 expression (22Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (3954) Google Scholar). The culture was shaken overnight at 20 °C. The harvested cells were lysed by sonication, and the RecD2 protein was purified by chromatography on Ni2+-NTA (Pro-Bond Resin, Invitrogen Corp.) and ssDNA cellulose (Sigma Aldrich), essentially as described (13Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52024-52032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fractions containing the highest amount of protein (by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 liters of enzyme storage buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol). The purified RecD2 concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a calculated absorption coefficient of 52,060 m−1 cm−1 (13Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52024-52032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide substrate DNAs were 5′-end-labeled in reaction mixtures that contained 107 nm [γ-32P]ATP (Perkin Elmer), 333 nm DNA, and 15 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas, Inc.), in reaction buffer supplied with the enzyme. The reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, at which time 333 nm (final concentration) of non-radioactive ATP was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min more. The 5′ 32P-labeled DNA was purified using a Qiagen nucleotide clean-up kit (Qiagen, Inc.). The concentration of the isolated DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting of samples removed before and after the purification procedure. Varying concentrations of RecD2 were mixed with a fixed concentration of 5′ 32P-labeled hairpin DNA (HP1, see Table 1) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 5% glycerol. The mixtures were allowed to sit at room temperature (23 °C) for 20 min, glycerol was added to a final concentration of 8%, and the samples were loaded onto a non-denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 1.98 mm EDTA, pH 8.3). Gels were run at 50 mA (constant current) for 1 h, dried, and imaged and quantitated using a Storm phosphorimager and ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). The binding data were fit to Y = YmaxET/(Kd + ET), where Y is the fraction of the DNA bound, ET is the total RecD2 protein concentration, Ymax is the maximal fraction bound at high RecD2 concentration, and Kd = [RecD2] [DNA]/[RecD2·DNA]. Double-stranded unwinding substrates were prepared by mixing a 5′ 32P-labeled ssDNA with its unlabeled complement (20 nm of each DNA) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 8 mm MgCl2. The mixtures were heated to 96 °C in a water bath for 3 min, cooled to room temperature, and then stored at 4 °C before use. For DNA unwinding reactions done manually (15 s to 5 min time scale), the reaction mixtures contained (final concentrations in 100 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 5% glycerol, and 1 nm 5′ 32P-labeled dsDNA substrate. RecD2 was added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 23 °C. A 10-μl sample was removed as a zero time point and mixed with 3.5 μl of 4× helicase quench solution (40% glycerol, 2.4% SDS, 100 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. The quench solution also contained 20 nm of unlabeled ssDNA that was the same sequence as the radiolabeled strand in the unwinding substrate, added to prevent reannealing of the unwound radiolabeled product strand.) ATP was added to 1 mm (final concentration) to initiate DNA unwinding, and samples were removed and quenched. In some reactions, a ssDNA oligonucleotide (2 μm, 40 nt) was added to bind to and inhibit RecD2 that did not bind to the radiolabeled dsDNA in the preincubation. This protein trap ssDNA was either added along with the ATP to start the reaction, included in the preincubation mixture along with the 32P-labeled dsDNA substrate, or omitted completely. The quenched unwinding samples were analyzed on 15% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide: bis-acrylamide) in TBE. The gels were run for 1 h at 150 V (constant voltage), dried, exposed, and imaged as above. The fraction of DNA unwound at each time point was determined by quantitation of the amount of [32P]dsDNA and [32P]ssDNA present in each lane, using ImageQuant. The fraction of [32P]ssDNA present in the t = 0 lane was subtracted from the fraction unwound at each time point. Certain substrates were unwound too rapidly by RecD2 to conduct accurate experiments by hand. Unwinding of these substrates was studied using a KinTek model RQF-3 Rapid Quench Flow instrument (KinTek Corp.). One reaction line was loaded with RecD2 and 2 nm 5′ 32P substrate dsDNA, and the second was loaded with 2 mm ATP. Both lines also contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. In reactions where protein trap ssDNA was added along with the ATP, the 40-mer ssDNA trap was included at 4 μm. The two reaction components were mixed to initiate the reaction, and then mixed with quench solution (400 mm EDTA and 0.7% SDS). The quenched reaction mixture was expelled into a receiving tube that contained enough non-radioactive ssDNA (corresponding to the 32P-strand in the substrate) to give a final concentration of 5 nm in the quenched mixture. Samples of the quenched reaction mixture (10 μl) were mixed with 3.5 μl of 4× helicase quench solution and then analyzed by electrophoresis as above. Kinetics data for reactions with the 12-bp substrate in the presence of the protein trap ssDNA were simulated with the mechanism shown in Fig. 4C, using the KinTekSim program (vers. 3.20, KinTek Corp.). We assumed: 1) identical rate constants for the unwinding steps (kunw), 2) the enzyme can dissociate from the partially unwound E·DNA complexes (koff), and 3) any enzyme that dissociates from a partially unwound DNA molecule is bound by the protein trap ssDNA and cannot reinitiate unwinding. Thus a dsDNA from which the enzyme dissociates cannot be unwound during the reaction. We assumed a maximum possible extent of unwinding of 85% (fraction unwound = 0.85), the reaction extent observed for the 12-bp substrate when no protein trap ssDNA was added (see Fig. 4A). It may be that some radiolabeled substrates are refractory to unwinding for some reason. In addition, we subtracted out the small amount of ssDNA that was often present in the samples taken before the unwinding reaction was started (12% of the dsDNA), which has the effect of reducing the calculated maximum extent of unwinding. Kinetics data with the 20-bp substrates in the absence of protein trap ssDNA were simulated with the mechanism in Fig. 5D. For simulations that used the full mechanism in Fig. 5D, values for all rate constants were specified first. Then, concentrations of all species present in the initial mixture (E, E2, dsDNA, and E·dsDNA) that were consistent with the rate constant values were determined as follows. We used the inferred values for the rate constants k+E, k−E, k+1, and k−1, and successive approximation to find the value of [E] that satisfied the following set of relations: [E2] = [E]2/(k+E/k−E), [E·dsDNA] = [E](DT)/{(k+1/k−1) + [E·dsDNA]}, and ET = [E] + [E·dsDNA] + 2[E2], where DT and ET are the total DNA and enzyme concentrations. These rate constants and the calculated values of [E], [E2], [E·dsDNA], and [dsDNA] were then used to simulate the reaction time course using KinTekSim. New values of the rate constants were then selected, the values of the concentrations recalculated, and the simulation repeated, until the simulated time course adequately reproduced the data. For simulations that omitted the RecD2 self-association step in Fig. 5D (the steps with rate constants k+/−E), initial values of [E], [dsDNA], and [E·dsDNA] were calculated using the guessed values for k+/−1 and Kd = k−1/k+1, [E·dsDNA] = {(DT + ET + Kd) − [(DT + ET + Kd)2 − 4DTET]1/2}/2, [dsDNA] = DT − [E·dsDNA], and [E] = ET − [E·dsDNA]. Size exclusion chromatography analysis was done using a Superdex 200 10/300GL column on an Akta FPLC system (GE Healthcare), with 0.25 ml/min flow-rate at 23 °C. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl. RecD2 (0.5 ml) was injected in storage buffer. Molecular weight standards were from Bio-Rad. Protein elution was monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm. Cross-linking mixtures contained 1 μm RecD2 in 25 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm NaCl. The 12-nt 5′-tailed hairpin DNA (HP1, 1 μm, see Table 1) was included in one mixture. The mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 23 °C, and then glutaraldehyde (PolySciences, Inc.) was added to 1.4 mm, final concentration. The mixtures were quenched after 20 min at 23 °C by adding 7.5 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Some quenched mixtures (75 μl) were then treated with benzonase nuclease (0.25 units/μl, Novagen Corp.) for 30 min at 37 °C, or with sodium borohydride (2 μl of 1 m NaBH4) for 5 min at 23 °C, or with both reagents for 30 min at 37 °C. The cross-linked samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels followed by silver staining. We found previously that RecD2 binds tightly to a 12-nt 5′ ssDNA-tailed partial duplex DNA (13Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52024-52032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We verified the binding in a gel-shift experiment using a hairpin DNA construct composed of 20 bp closed by a 3-nt loop, with a 12-nt 5′ single-stranded extension (HP1, see Table 1). The binding data (Fig. 1) were fit to a single binding isotherm with Kd = 2.5 (±1.3) nm (average of three determinations). The binding data were also simulated using rate constants that fit the unwinding data (Fig. 1, see Fig. 2 and “Discussion”).FIGURE 2DNA unwinding by RecD2. RecD2 (100 nm) was incubated with 5′ 32P-labeled 12 nt:20 bp DNA (1 nm) for 20 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 5% glycerol at 23 °C. Samples were removed and analyzed on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. A, unwinding reaction was initiated by adding ATP (1 mm, final concentration). B, protein trap ssDNA (40 nt, 2 μm, final concentration) was included in the 20-min preincubation of RecD2 and [32P]dsDNA substrate. The reaction was initiated by adding ATP. C, reaction was initiated by adding a mixture of ATP and ssDNA protein trap (40 nt, 2 μm). D, radioactivity in gels A–C was quantitated using a Storm phosphorimager.

The solid line is a simulation using the mechanism shown in Fig. 5D, with k+E = 5 × 106m−1 s−1, k−E = 0.02 s−1, k+1 = 1 × 107m−1 s−1, k−1 = 0.02 s−1, kunw = 4.5 s−1, and koff = 1.9 s−1.

The first substrate tested was a 20-bp duplex DNA with a 12-nt 5′ single-stranded extension (12 nt:20 bp, see Table 1). The DNA was unwound essentially to completion within about 1 min, in assays that contained 1 nm DNA and 100 nm RecD2 (Fig. 2, A and D). We then attempted to measure DNA unwinding under single turnover conditions. RecD2 was mixed first with the 32P-labeled dsDNA substrate to allow formation of an enzyme-DNA complex. The reaction was initiated by adding ATP and a large excess of single-stranded DNA to trap and inhibit RecD2 that is not bound to the substrate DNA and limit the bound enzyme to a single turnover. As a control, the protein trap ssDNA was added to the initial mixture of RecD2 and 32P-labeled dsDNA substrate. We found that 2 μm of a 40-nt ssDNA oligonucleotide inhibited substantially the unwinding reaction when it was included in the preincubation mixture of RecD2 and [32P]dsDNA substrate (Fig. 2, B and D). The same amount of ssDNA also inhibited to about the same degree when it was added along with the ATP (Fig. 2, C and D). Similar inhibition by the protein trap ssDNA in both protocols was observed in reactions containing higher ATP concentrations (0.5–10 mm ATP, with [MgCl]2 also varied to maintain constant free Mg2+; data not shown). We found previously that 20-bp DNA substrates with 5′-ssDNA tails shorter than 8 nt were poor unwinding substrates for RecD2, whereas 10- and 12-nt 5′-tailed substrates were unwound equally well (13Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52024-52032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Lengthening the ssDNA tail beyond the minimum length required for unwinding has been found to increase the efficiency or extent of DNA unwinding by some helicases (23Nanduri B. Byrd A.K. Eoff R.L. Tackett A.J. Raney K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 14722-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26005-26012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We tested whether a longer 5′-tail would affect the RecD2-unwinding reaction, using a 20-bp duplex substrate with a 24-nt 5′-ssDNA terminal extension (24 nt:20 bp, twice the tail-length as on the substrate used in Fig. 2). As observed for the 12-nt 5′-tailed substrate, this extended 5′-tailed DNA was unwound in the reaction with no protein trap, but there was little unwinding when the protein trap DNA was added with the ATP (Fig. 3). Thus a longer ssDNA tail did not affect the RecD2-unwinding kinetics. We then carried out the unwinding reactions with a shorter, 12-bp DNA duplex, with a 20-nt 5′-ssDNA tail (20 nt:12 bp; Fig. 4). This DNA was unwound rapidly in the reaction with no protein trap ssDNA, and the trap ssDNA inhibited significantly when added along with the 32P-labeled substrate. Now, however, there was significant unwinding of the 12-bp substrate despite the trap ssDNA, when the RecD2 was allowed to bind first to the [32P]DNA, and the trap was added along with the ATP (Fig. 4A). This result shows that a preformed RecD2-DNA complex is able to unwind the 12-bp DNA with only a small inhibitory effect of the protein trap ssDNA. The results suggest that the low extent of reaction with the longer 20-bp substrates (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3) is due to the low processivity of RecD2. The reaction with the 12-bp substrate is quite fast, and so we repeated the single turnover experiment using a rapid-quench device to detect a more complete reaction time course (Fig. 4B). We found previously that a 20-bp duplex with a forked end (having both 5′ and 3′ 12-nt ssDNA extensions) was bound more tightly and unwound more rapidly than the 12-nt 5′-tailed 20-bp substrate (13Wang J. Julin D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52024-52032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We tested this DNA substrate (fork:20 bp) in the single-turnover reaction protocol (Fig. 5). As observed previously, the forked DNA is unwound more rapidly than the 5′-tailed substrate, in the reaction with no protein trap. The protein trap ssDNA inhibited the reaction when premixed with the 32P-substrate (Fig. 5A), although the inhibition was not as great as with the 12-nt 5′-tailed substrate in Fig. 2. However, the amount of DNA unwound in the reaction where the protein trap was added with the ATP was no greater than that where the ssDNA trap was included in the preincubation mixture (Fig. 5A). (Addition of higher concentrations of the protein trap ssDNA completely suppressed the reaction whether added before or along with the ATP (data not shown).) We verified that RecD2 binds to the forked substrate in the preincubation mixtures, by removing samples before ATP was added and analyzing on a native polyacrylamide gel, as in Fig. 1. The result"
https://openalex.org/W2135988683,"Nuclear histones have previously been shown to aggregate LDL in vitro, suggestive of a possible pro-atherogenic role. Recent studies indicate that histones are released during acute inflammation, and therefore might interact with circulating lipoproteins in vivo. In view of the associative link between inflammation and cardiovascular disease, the behaviour of histones was investigated using in vitro models of LDL retention and foam cell formation.Heparin agarose beads were used as a model of a matrix rich in sulphated glycosaminoglycans, to which histones bind strongly. Histone-modified beads were observed to pull down more LDL from solution than untreated beads, indicating that histones can function as bridging molecules, enhancing LDL retention. Furthermore, addition of heparin inhibited histone-induced aggregation of LDL. To model foam cell formation, murine RAW 264.7 macrophages were incubated for 24 h in the presence of LDL, histones, LDL plus histones or vehicle control. Cells incubated with LDL in the presence of histones accumulated significantly more intracellular lipid than with LDL or histone alone.These results are consistent with a potential pro-atherogenic role for extracellular histones, which should be investigated further."
