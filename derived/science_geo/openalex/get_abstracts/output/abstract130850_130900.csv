https://openalex.org/W2031630601,"In vivo selection of phage display libraries was used to isolate peptides that home specifically to tumor blood vessels. When coupled to the anticancer drug doxorubicin, two of these peptides—one containing an α v integrin–binding Arg-Gly-Asp motif and the other an Asn-Gly-Arg motif—enhanced the efficacy of the drug against human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice and also reduced its toxicity. These results indicate that it may be possible to develop targeted chemotherapy strategies that are based on selective expression of receptors in tumor vasculature."

https://openalex.org/W1963578989,"Although many cellular and organismal changes have been described in aging individuals, a precise, molecular cause of aging has yet to be found. A prior study of aging yeast mother cells showed a progressive enlargement and fragmentation of the nucleolus. Here we show that these nucleolar changes are likely due to the accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) in old cells and that, in fact, ERCs cause aging. Mutants for sgs1, the yeast homolog of the Werner's syndrome gene, accumulate ERCs more rapidly, leading to premature aging and a shorter life span. We speculate on the generality of this molecular cause of aging in higher species, including mammals."

Bacterial adherence to the human gastric epithelial lining is mediated by the fucosylated Lewis b (Le b ) histo-blood group antigen. The Le b -binding adhesin, BabA, was purified by receptor activity–directed affinity tagging. The bacterial Le b -binding phenotype was associated with the presence of the cag pathogenicity island among clinical isolates of H. pylori . A vaccine strategy based on the BabA adhesin might serve as a means to target the virulent type I strains of H. pylori."
https://openalex.org/W2077721150,"The development of plant root systems is sensitive to the availability and distribution of nutrients within the soil. For example, lateral roots proliferate preferentially within nitrate (NO 3 – )-rich soil patches. A NO 3 − -inducible Arabidopsis gene ( ANR1 ), was identified that encodes a member of the MADS box family of transcription factors. Transgenic plants in which ANR1 was repressed had an altered sensitivity to NO 3 – and no longer responded to NO 3 – -rich zones by lateral root proliferation, indicating that ANR1 is a key determinant of developmental plasticity in Arabidopsis roots."
https://openalex.org/W2071335594,"Benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC) is an autosomal dominant epilepsy of infancy, with loci mapped to human chromosomes 20q13.3 and 8q24. By positional cloning, a potassium channel gene ( KCNQ2 ) located on 20q13.3 was isolated and found to be expressed in brain. Expression of KCNQ2 in frog ( Xenopus laevis ) oocytes led to potassium-selective currents that activated slowly with depolarization. In a large pedigree with BFNC, a five–base pair insertion would delete more than 300 amino acids from the KCNQ2 carboxyl terminus. Expression of the mutant channel did not yield measurable currents. Thus, impairment of potassium-dependent repolarization is likely to cause this age-specific epileptic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1971505103,"Circulating lymphocytes are recruited from the blood to the tissue by rolling along the endothelium until being stopped by a signaling event linked to the Gialpha subunit of a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein; that event then triggers rapid integrin-dependent adhesion. Four chemokines are now shown to induce such adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and to induce arrest of rolling cells within 1 second under flow conditions similar to those of blood. SDF-1 (also called PBSF), 6-C-kine (also called Exodus-2), and MIP-3beta (also called ELC or Exodus-3) induced adhesion of most circulating lymphocytes, including most CD4+ T cells; and MIP-3alpha (also called LARC or Exodus-1) triggered adhesion of memory, but not naïve, CD4+ T cells. Thus, chemokines can regulate the arrest of lymphocyte subsets under flowing conditions, which may allow them to control lymphocyte-endothelial cell recognition and lymphocyte recruitment in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2081046745,"Chemical vapor deposition of germanium onto the silicon (001) surface at atmospheric pressure and 600 degrees Celsius has previously been shown to produce distinct families of smaller (up to 6 nanometers high) and larger (all approximately 15 nanometers high) nanocrystals. Under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions, physical vapor deposition at approximately the same substrate temperature and growth rate produced a similar bimodal size distribution. In situ scanning tunneling microscopy revealed that the smaller square-based pyramids transform abruptly during growth to significantly larger multifaceted domes, and that few structures with intermediate size and shape remain. Both nanocrystal shapes have size-dependent energy minima that result from the interplay between strain relaxation at the facets and stress concentration at the edges. A thermodynamic model similar to a phase transition accounts for this abrupt morphology change."
https://openalex.org/W2151468131,"A mouse gene, mper1, having all the properties expected of a circadian clock gene, was reported recently. This gene is expressed in a circadian pattern in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). mper1 maintains this pattern of circadian expression in constant darkness and can be entrained to a new light/dark cycle. Here we report the isolation of a second mammalian gene, mper2, which also has these properties and greater homology to Drosophila period. Expression of mper1 and mper2 is overlapping but asynchronous by 4 hr. mper1, unlike period and mper2, is expressed rapidly after exposure to light at CT22. It appears that mper1 is the pacemaker component which responds to light and thus mediates photic entrainment."
https://openalex.org/W2057522076,"To understand how light might entrain a mammalian circadian clock, we examined the effects of light on mPer1, a sequence homolog of Drosophila per, that exhibits robust rhythmic expression in the SCN. mPer1 is rapidly induced by short duration exposure to light at levels sufficient to reset the clock, and dose-response curves reveal that mPer1 induction shows both reciprocity and a strong correlation with phase shifting of the overt rhythm. Thus, in both the phasing of dark expression and the response to light mPer1 is most similar to the Neurospora clock gene frq. Within the SCN there appears to be localization of the induction phenomenon, consistent with the localization of both light-sensitive and light-insensitive oscillators in this circadian center."

https://openalex.org/W2158977548,"The three-dimensional structure of the human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) nucleocapsid protein (NC) bound to the SL3 stem-loop recognition element of the genomic Psi RNA packaging signal has been determined by heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Tight binding (dissociation constant, approximately 100 nM) is mediated by specific interactions between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal CCHC-type zinc knuckles of the NC protein and the G7 and G9 nucleotide bases, respectively, of the G6-G7-A8-G9 RNA tetraloop. A8 packs against the amino-terminal knuckle and forms a hydrogen bond with conserved Arg32, and residues Lys3 to Arg10 of NC form a 310 helix that binds to the major groove of the RNA stem and also packs against the amino-terminal zinc knuckle. The structure provides insights into the mechanism of viral genome recognition, explains extensive amino acid conservation within NC, and serves as a basis for the development of inhibitors designed to interfere with genome encapsidation."

https://openalex.org/W2068762318,"The molybdenum-containing enzyme sulfite oxidase catalyzes the conversion of sulfite to sulfate, the terminal step in the oxidative degradation of cysteine and methionine. Deficiency of this enzyme in humans usually leads to major neurological abnormalities and early death. The crystal structure of chicken liver sulfite oxidase at 1.9 Å resolution reveals that each monomer of the dimeric enzyme consists of three domains. At the active site, the Mo is penta-coordinated by three sulfur ligands, one oxo group, and one water/hydroxo. A sulfate molecule adjacent to the Mo identifies the substrate binding pocket. Four variants associated with sulfite oxidase deficiency have been identified: two mutations are near the sulfate binding site, while the other mutations occur within the domain mediating dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2033520740,"The possibility that membrane fusion events in the postsynaptic cell may be required for the change in synaptic strength resulting from long-term potentiation (LTP) was examined. Introducing substances into the postsynaptic cell that block membrane fusion at a number of different steps reduced LTP. Introducing SNAP, a protein that promotes membrane fusion, into cells enhanced synaptic transmission, and this enhancement was significantly less when generated in synapses that expressed LTP. Thus, postsynaptic fusion events, which could be involved either in retrograde signaling or in regulating postsynaptic receptor function or both, contribute to LTP."

https://openalex.org/W1976612957,"The dimeric form of the kinesin motor and neck domain from rat brain with bound ADP has been solved by X-ray crystallography. The two heads of the dimer are connected via a coiled-coil alpha-helical interaction of their necks. They are broadly similar to one another; differences are most apparent in the head-neck junction and in a moderate reorientation of the neck helices in order to adopt to the coiled-coil conformation. The heads show a rotational symmetry (approximately 120 degrees) about an axis close to that of the coiled-coil. This arrangement is unexpected since it is not compatible with the microtubule lattice. In this arrangement, the two heads of a kinesin dimer could not have equivalent interactions with microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W2098141162,"Histone acetylation may act to mark and maintain transcriptionally active or inactive chromosomal domains through the cell cycle and in different lineages. A novel role for histone acetylation in centromere regulation has been identified. Exposure of fission yeast cells to TSA, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylase, interferes with repression of marker genes in centromeric heterochromatin, causes chromosome loss, and disrupts the localization of Swi6p, a component of centromeric heterochromatin. Transient TSA treatment induces a heritable hyperacetylated state in centromeric chromatin that is propagated in lineages in the absence of drug. This state is linked in cis to the treated centromere locus and correlates with inheritance of functionally defective centromeres and persistent chromosome segregation problems. Thus, assembly of fully functional centromeres is partly imprinted in the underacetylated or transcriptionally silent state of centromeric chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2016286342,The mechanism of DNA mismatch repair has been modeled upon biochemical studies of the E. coli DNA adenine methylation–instructed pathway where the initial recognition of mismatched nucleotides is performed by the MutS protein. ut omologs (MSH) have been identified based on a highly conserved region containing a Walker-A adenine nucleotide binding motif. Here we show that adenine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by the human mismatch recognition complex hMSH2-hMSH6 functions as a novel molecular switch. The hMSH2-hMSH6 complex is ON (binds mismatched nucleotides) in the ADP-bound form and OFF in the ATP-bound form. These results suggest a new model for the function of MutS proteins during mismatch repair in which the switch determines the timing of downstream events.
https://openalex.org/W2070160790,"Four members (SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, and CIS) of a family of cytokine-inducible, negative regulators of cytokine receptor signaling have recently been identified. To address whether any of these genes are induced in response to growth hormone (GH), serum-starved 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were incubated with GH for various time points, and the expression of the SOCS gene family was analyzed by Northern blotting. GH stimulated the rapid, transient induction ofSOCS-3 mRNA, peaking 30 min after the initiation of GH exposure and declining to basal levels by 2 h. Expression of the other SOCS genes (SOCS-1, SOCS-2,CIS) was also up-regulated by GH, although to a lesser extent than SOCS-3 and with differing kinetics.SOCS-3 expression was also strongly induced in 3T3-F442A cells treated with leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), with weaker induction of SOCS-1 and CIS being observed. The preferential induction of SOCS-3 mRNA was also observed in hepatic RNA isolated from the livers of mice that had received a single supraphysiological dose of GH intraperitoneally.

Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism(s) by which signaling from GH receptor-activated Jak2 is attenuated is unclear. Ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation/activation of Jak2 by the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor, a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily that includes the GH receptor, is followed by the binding of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (2Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The recruitment of SHP-1 is accompanied by the dephosphorylation/inactivation of Jak2 and subsequent termination of EPO-induced cellular proliferation. A similar role for SHP-1 in mediating the down-regulation of Jak2 following stimulation of cells with GH has been proposed (3Hackett R.H. Wang Y.-D. Sweitzer S. Feldman G. Wood W.I. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11128-11132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), although whether SHP-1 can directly associate with the GH receptor remains to be established. Recently, a novel family of cytokine-inducible genes has been identified that appear to function as negative regulators of the JAK signaling pathway (4Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A.

As a diverse array of cytokines appears to be able to induce expression of one or more members of this gene family (5Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J.L. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar), we sought to establish which, if any, of these genes might be a target for transcriptional activation by GH in vivo and in the classically GH-responsive cell line, 3T3-F442A fibroblasts (8Morikawa M. Nixon T. Green H. Cell. 1982; 29: 783-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Recombinant human GH was the generous gift of Dr. Ken Ho (Garvan Institute for Medical Research, Sydney, NSW); human insulin was obtained from Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd. (North Rocks, NSW); leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) was obtained from AMRAD Pharmacia Biotech (Melbourne, Victoria). Radionucleotide [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN (AMRAD Pharmacia Biotech), Hybond-N+ membrane from Amersham Australia Pty Ltd (Melbourne), and GIGA prime DNA Labeling Kits from Bresatec Ltd. (Adelaide, SA). Cell culture media and reagents were from Life Technologies Pty Ltd. (Melbourne). 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2at 37 °C. For hormone induction experiments, cells were grown to confluence and serum-starved overnight in DMEM containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Human GH (500 ng/ml), LIF (104units/ml), or insulin (56 ng/ml) were added, and cell culture was maintained for different time intervals. Female C57BL/6 mice (7 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with GH (10 μg/10 g of body weight) and were subsequently sacrificed at different time points. Livers were removed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −75 °C. Cell cultures were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; total RNA was extracted from cell cultures and liver samples using guanidinium thiocyanate-acid phenol (9Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred and subsequently fixed onto Hybond-N+ membranes as described (10Beckers T. Schmidt P. Hilgard P. Biotechniques. 1994; 16: 1074-1078PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were hybridized at 63 °C overnight with random primed, radiolabeled probes derived from full-length cDNA inserts encoding SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, or CIS (5Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J.L. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar). Membranes were then washed at high stringency (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C) and exposed to Kodak BioMax MS film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C. Where blots were reprobed, membranes were first stripped in boiling 0.1% SDS prior to prehybridization. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were transfected as described previously (11Hansen L.H. Wang X. Kopchick J.J. Bouchelouche P. Nielsen J.H. Galsgaard E.D. Billestrup N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12669-12673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure with 1.5 μg of rat GH receptor-encoding plasmid, 3 μg of β-galactosidase internal control reporter plasmid, 1.5 μg of the GH-responsive, serine protease inhibitor (Spi) 2.1 promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct, and 1 μg of Flag epitope-tagged SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3, or CIS expression vectors. After overnight culture in the absence or presence of GH (25 nm), cell extracts were prepared, and CAT and β-galactosidase activities were measured. Equivalent expression of the various SOCS and CIS poteins was confirmed by Western blotting portions of extracts from transfected cells with the Flag-specific monoclonal antibody, M2. In the absence of GH, Northern blotting of total RNA isolated from serum-starved 3T3-F442A cells detected low levels ofSOCS-3 and SOCS-1 mRNA (Fig.1). Transcripts corresponding toSOCS-2 and CIS were only observed upon prolonged exposure. Upon the addition of GH, induction of SOCS-3expression was apparent at the first time point examined (15 min), peaking at 30 min before declining rapidly over subsequent time points (Fig. 1). This pattern of induction has been confirmed independently using both total and poly(A)+ mRNA (data not shown). The induction of SOCS-1, by comparison, was much less pronounced although with similar kinetics (Fig. 1). Both CISand SOCS-2 mRNA were up-regulated in response to GH treatment (Fig. 1); with respect to CIS, induction peaked 60 min after hormonal exposure, and although the abundance of transcript had declined at time points assayed thereafter, expression remained significantly above basal levels. Similarly, while the induction ofSOCS-2 mRNA exhibited delayed kinetics compared with other SOCS genes, elevated levels of the SOCS-2 message persisted to the final time point assayed (4 h). Because 3T3-F442A fibroblasts express functional receptors for LIF and insulin (12Smit L.S. Meyer D.J. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 519-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the ability of these ligands to influence SOCS gene expression was examined. LIF treatment strongly inducedSOCS-3 mRNA expression, with the response appearing maximal after a 15-min stimulation with growth factor (Fig.2). Interestingly, the subsequent down-regulation of SOCS-3 transcripts was significantly delayed by comparison with GH-treated cultures, with elevated levels of transcripts persisting at the final time point (4 h) assayed. BothSOCS-1 and CIS mRNAs were induced in response to LIF, albeit to a much lesser extent than SOCS-3, and returned to basal levels by 4 h (Fig. 2). No induction ofSOCS-2 was observed (data not shown), while no member of the SOCS gene family was induced in cell cultures treated with insulin (data not shown). Strikingly, analysis of hepatic RNA isolated from the livers of mice injected with a single dose of GH confirmed the preferential activation of SOCS-3mRNA expression by GH (Fig. 3). A marked elevation of SOCS-3 expression was observed around 60 min following GH injection, declining thereafter. Of the other SOCS family genes, clear induction of CIS expression was found 30 min after hormone injection, peaking at 60 min, and remaining elevated even after 24 h (Fig. 3). In contrast, SOCS-1 andSOCS-2 were only weakly induced by GH. To explore the functional consequences of GH-induced expression of the different SOCS family genes, we determined the ability of GH to transactivate the GH-responsive Spi 2.1 promoter, linked to a CAT reporter gene, in CHO cells co-transfected with the various SOCS-encoding plasmids. In cells that were not transfected with SOCS expression constructs, GH induced a 3.4-fold increase in CAT activity from the Spi 2.1 promoter (Fig.4). While constitutive expression of CIS had no effect on the hormonal responsiveness of the Spi 2.1 promoter, expression of either SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 ablated the ability of GH to transactivate reporter gene activity from the same promoter. Paradoxically, co-expression of SOCS-2 resulted in the superinduction of CAT activity in response to GH, giving a 7–9-fold increase above basal levels of activity. The identification of SOCS-3 as a major transcriptional target of GH action raises a number of questions, in particular how might SOCS-3 act to regulate signaling by the GH receptor. SOCS-1 can bind directly to Jak2 and Tyk2 (6Endo T.A. Masahura M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N. Taniguchi T.

Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). As Jak2 is the principal effector of GH action at a cellular level, it would be anticipated that enforced expression of SOCS-1 in transfected CHO cells would block GH-mediated transactivation of the Spi 2.1 promoted CAT reporter construct, as observed in the present study (Fig. 4). To what extent SOCS-1 actually participates to down-regulate signaling from the ligand-activated GH receptor-Jak2 complex in vivo is not known, particularly given the very low level of SOCS-1 mRNA expressed in hepatic tissue following a GH pulse. In a contrasting mechanism of action, CIS, presumably via its SH2 domain, binds directly to the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic domains of the EPO receptor and β-chain of the interleukin-3 receptor (4Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). While CIS has little effect on the activity of Jak2 (6Endo T.A. Masahura M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N.

Nature. 1997; 387: 921-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar), the principal effector molecule activated by EPO, it appears to act by preventing the docking of Stat5 (and other potential substrates?) onto the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of the EPO receptor (13Mui A.L-F. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The absence of a discernible effect of constitutively expressed CIS on the ability of GH to transactivate the Spi 2.1 promoter is an interesting result. Three tyrosines in the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the GH receptor (at positions 534, 566, and 627) can independently mediate GH-induced transcription from the Spi 2.1 promoter (11Hansen L.H. Wang X. Kopchick J.J. Bouchelouche P. Nielsen J.H. Galsgaard E.D. Billestrup N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12669-12673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Deletion/mutation of all three blocks activation of this promoter by GH. Recently, we have established that, in their phosphorylated state, each of these tyrosines can directly interact with Stat5 (14Hansen J.A. Hansen L.H. Wang X. Kopchick J.J. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nielsen J.H. Moldrup A. Galsgaard E.D. Billestrup N. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 18: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), thus representing a critical first step leading toward the transactivation of the Spi 2.1 promoter by GH. The inability of CIS overexpression to block transactivation would suggest that CIS does not bind to any of the three phosphotyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of the GH receptor that serve as Stat5 binding sites, implying there may be specificity in cytokine receptor-CIS interaction. What mechanism is employed by SOCS-3 in down-regulating signaling from the ligand-activated GH receptor, or any other cytokine receptor, is not known at this point in time. Similarly, how co-expression of SOCS-2 facilitates the superinduction of reporter gene activity in response to GH has not been elucidated. It is conceivable that, in transfected cells, overexpression of SOCS-2 might somehow result in a dominant-negative phenotype by interfering with the capacity of GH to activate endogenous regulators (i.e. SOCS-3) of hormone-receptor signal transduction. GH activates Jak2 in 3T3-F442A cells, while LIF activates both Jak1 and -2; both hormones induce the tyrosyl phosphorylation of Stats1, -3, and -5 in these cells (12Smit L.S. Meyer D.J. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 519-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Clearly, one or more of these factors may be involved in the transcriptional induction of SOCS-3 and other gene family members following hormonal exposure. This is supported by the observation that expression of a dominant-negative Stat5 blocks IL-3 induction of CIS in Ba/F3 cells (13Mui A.L-F. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) while a dominant-negative Stat3 blocks IL-6/LIF induction ofSOCS-1 mRNA in M1 cells (7Naka T. Narazaki M. Hirata M. Matsumoto T. Minamoto S. Aono A. Nishimoto N. Kajita T. Taga T. Yoshizaki K. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Nature. 1997; 387: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only Stat5 is activated in the livers of normal rats in response to a GH pulse (15Chow J.C. Ling P.R. Qu Z. Laviola L. Ciccarone A. Bistrian B.R. Smith R.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2880-2886Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). If STAT transcription factors assume a dominant role in the transcriptional activation of the SOCS gene family, then this last observation would imply that Stat5 is a critical element in the activation of SOCS-3 and CIS transcription by GHin vivo. The preferential induction of SOCS-3 mRNA by GH, bothin vivo and in vitro, contrasts with results obtained using IL-6 (5Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J.L. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar). All four SOCS gene transcripts are elevated in mouse liver following the injection of IL-6, although the kinetics of induction/persistence of individual mRNAs differs. However, only the induction of SOCS-1 and CIS mRNA is found in M1 cells treated with IL-6 (5Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J.L. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1805) Google Scholar). Whether the association between GH and SOCS-3 occurs in other tissues, or other GH-responsive cell lines, remains to be established.

https://openalex.org/W2039492407,"In order to reach the inner membrane of the mitochondrion, multispanning carrier proteins must cross the aqueous intermembrane space. Two essential proteins of that space, Tim10p and Tim12p, were shown to mediate import of multispanning carriers into the inner membrane. Both proteins formed a complex with the inner membrane protein Tim22p. Tim10p readily dissociated from the complex and was required to transport carrier precursors across the outer membrane; Tim12p was firmly bound to Tim22p and mediated the insertion of carriers into the inner membrane. Neither protein was required for protein import into the other mitochondrial compartments. Both proteins may function as intermembrane space chaperones for the highly insoluble carrier proteins."

The NF2 gene isolated by positional cloning encodes merlin, named for its striking similarity with moesin, ezrin, and radixin, three closely related proteins commonly referred to as the ERM family, a subclass of the protein 4.1 superfamily thought to link cytoskeletal components with proteins in the cell membrane (2Gusella J.F.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The ERM proteins share ∼78% amino acid identity with each other, and all three are 45–47% identical to merlin (4Trofatter J.A. MacCollin M.M. Rutter J.L. Murrell J.R. Duyao M.P. Parry D.M. Eldridge R. Kley N. Menon A.G. Pulaski K. Haase V.H. Ambrose C.M. Munroe D. Bove C. Haines J.L. Martuza R.L. MacDonald M.E.

In cultured cells, ERM proteins are highly concentrated in regions of contact between actin filaments and the plasma membrane, acting as possible linkers between integral membrane and cytoskeletal proteins (5Bretcher A.

The carboxyl termini of both ezrin and moesin bind directly to actin in vitro (10Turunen O. Wahlström T. Vaheri A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 11Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) via a conserved actin binding site present in ezrin, moesin, and radixin but not in merlin. These findings suggest that the carboxyl terminus of the ERM proteins is responsible for their association with the actin-based cytoskeleton. Recently, however, another actin binding site in the amino-terminal domain of ezrin has been characterized in vitro and shown to be conserved in moesin, radixin, and merlin (12Martin M. Roy C. Montcourrier P. Sahuquet A. Mangeat P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1543-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The highly conserved amino-terminal half of the ERM proteins also contains the domain responsible for interaction with membrane proteins, particularly the glycoprotein CD44 (13Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). ERM-CD44 complexes are also associated with RhoGDI (RhoGDP dissociation inhibitor) (14Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), and the ERM proteins have been directly implicated in Rho- and Rac-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization in permeabilized cells (15Mackay D. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We have reported that endogenous merlin localizes to the actin-rich motile regions (i.e. leading and ruffling edges) in human fibroblast and meningioma cells where it co-localizes with actin but is not associated with stress fibers (16Gonzalez-Agosti C. Xu L. Pinney D. Beauchamp R. Hobbs W. Gusella J. Ramesh V. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1239-1247PubMed Google Scholar). Merlin when overexpressed in cells, however, localizes to membrane ruffles as well as to other actin-rich structures such as microvilli and filopodia thus resembling the ERM proteins (17Xu L. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Beauchamp R. Pinney D. Sterner C. Ramesh V. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Given the similarity between merlin and the ERM proteins, it is likely that merlin's normal function also involves interactions with membrane and cytoskeletal components. We have used the yeast two-hybrid interaction trap strategy to search for proteins that may associate with merlin. Here, we describe a human cDNA (merintc) that interacts not only with merlin, but also with the ERM proteins via their conserved amino-terminal domain. This cDNA encoded the carboxyl terminus of the human homologue of NHE-RF, which was originally identified as a cofactor that mediates protein kinase A inhibition of a renal brush-border membrane Na+-H+ exchanger in rabbit (18Weinman E.J. Dubinsky W. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Exogenously expressed human NHE-RF also co-localizes with merlin and moesin. Our findings suggest that NHE-RF is a biologically significant interactor for the MERM (merlin and ERM) family of proteins and may be a participant in the activation of the Na+-H+exchange required for actin cytoskeleton reorganization. During the preparation of this manuscript a report appeared showing that NHE-RF binds to ezrin (19Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretcher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the merlin sequence (aa 8–595, isoform1) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned into the yeast LexA DNA binding vector pEG202 (20Gyuris J. Golemis E.A. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar), and the plasmid was designated as pmerbait. To identify proteins interacting with merlin isoform 1, yeast strain EGY88 was sequentially transformed with the pmerbait and a human fetal frontal cortex interaction library fused to the activation domain of GAL4 in the plasmid pJG4-5 and selected on ura−, his−, trp−, leu − plates. A partial merintc clone was obtained (see “Results”) and subsequently used as a probe to screen a human fetal brain library in λZAP (Stratagene) by standard techniques to obtain a full-length clone. These clones were sequenced, and sequences were analyzed using software provided by the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) and the BLAST network service at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (21Altschul S.F. Thomas M.L. Alejandro S.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (60189) Google Scholar). Full-length (aa 1–595) as well as the amino (aa 1–332) and carboxyl (aa 308–595) portions of merlin were expressed as GST fusion proteins using the vector pGEX2T (16Gonzalez-Agosti C. Xu L. Pinney D. Beauchamp R. Hobbs W. Gusella J. Ramesh V. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1239-1247PubMed Google Scholar). Another full-length merlin construct encoding a naturally occurring NF2 missense mutation, Asn220 → Tyr (22MacCollin M. Mohney T. Trofatter J. Wertelecki W. Ramesh V. Gusella J.F. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1993; 270: 2316-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and expressed as a GST fusion protein. Similarly full-length (aa 1–577), amino (aa 1–332), and carboxyl (aa 307–577) segments of human moesin were expressed as GST fusion proteins using the vector pGEX4T1. Expression and purification of the GST fusion proteins were performed as described previously for merlin (16Gonzalez-Agosti C. Xu L. Pinney D. Beauchamp R. Hobbs W. Gusella J. Ramesh V. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1239-1247PubMed Google Scholar) and using the standard method of Smith and Johnson (23Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar) for moesin. For radixin, His6-tagged constructs were employed, and these have been described previously (24Magendantz M. Henry M.D. Lander A. Solomon F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25324-25327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The entire coding sequence of hNHE-RF-(1–358) engineered to have the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag at the 5′ end was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. The entire coding sequence of merlin was expressed as a GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein employing the vector pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). These expression constructs were transfected in COS-7 cells and HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate method using the Cell Phect kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) employing 10–20 μg of the plasmid DNA. Transient transfections were performed, and cells were harvested after 72 h. An antipeptide rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the carboxyl-terminal amino acids SLAMAKERAHQKR (aa 328–340) specific to human NHE-RF by Research Genetics, Inc., Huntsville, AL. The antiserum obtained (NP1) was further affinity-purified. The anti-merlin antibodies and the antibodies for moesin have been described previously (16Gonzalez-Agosti C. Xu L. Pinney D. Beauchamp R. Hobbs W. Gusella J. Ramesh V. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1239-1247PubMed Google Scholar, 25Winckler B. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Magendantz M. Solomon F. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2523-2534PubMed Google Scholar). The hybridoma supernatant for the HA-tag was kindly provided by Dr. Ed Harlow (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). COS-7 cell lysates overexpressing hNHE-RF were incubated with 300 pmol of GST-merlin or GST-moesin immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GSH) beads. The beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing Pefabloc, resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-hNHE-RF (affinity-purified NP1). For radixin, COS-7 cell lysates overexpressing the interactor were incubated with 600 pmol of the His6-tagged full-length, amino-terminal, or carboxyl-terminal radixin polypeptides. The complexes were separated from the reaction mixture using Ni-NTA beads. The beads were washed (20 mm imidazole, 50 mmsodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and the specifically bound complexes were eluted with the same buffer containing 400 mm imidazole separated on SDS-PAGE gel and detected with NP1 antibody as described above. The immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (16Gonzalez-Agosti C. Xu L. Pinney D. Beauchamp R. Hobbs W. Gusella J. Ramesh V. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1239-1247PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:100) was used as a primary antibody to detect the localization of hNHE-RF. The affinity-purified moesin antibody was used as described earlier (9Henry M.D. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Solomon F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1007-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cells were examined on a Nikon microscope using a 40 × 1.3 N.A. and 60 × 1.4 N.A. objectives. For confocal microscopy, cells were examined with Leica TCS-NT 4D scanning laser confocal microscope. To identify proteins that associate with merlin, we screened a human fetal frontal cortex interaction library with pmerbait. About 106 primary transformants were pooled and replated (at a multiplicity of 20) onto galactose leu −selection plates. Thirty-three colonies, which showed galactose-dependent growth and blue color onleu − plates and on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside medium, respectively, were identified, and plasmids containing the cDNA clones were isolated. Restriction mapping and hybridization experiments revealed that these cDNAs were clustered into three different groups of overlapping clones, representing three novel cDNAs. In this study we report the characterization of one of the cDNAs, an 880-base pair fragment which we refer to as merintc. We tested merintc for associations in yeast strains containing either the amino- (aa 1–341) or the carboxyl- (aa 342–595) terminal portion of merlin as bait. Results of these tests indicated that merintc specifically associates with full-length and amino-terminal merlin constructs (data not shown). The largest merintc fusion clone was sequenced, and a BLASTX search of GenBank revealed strong similarity with the carboxyl-terminal segment of rabbit NHE-RF, a protein that mediates protein kinase A inhibition of the renal brush-border membrane Na+-H+exchanger (18Weinman E.J. Dubinsky W. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA clone was isolated from a human fetal brain library and was sequenced, revealing 88% identity (across the open reading frame) with rabbit NHE-RF. The predicted 358 amino acid protein shares 86% identity with both the rabbit protein and its mouse homologue and contains 2 PDZ repeats between amino acids 11–97 and 149–236, with an expected molecular mass of 39 kDa (Fig.1). Consequently, merintc appears to derive from the human homologue of NHE-RF which we refer to as hNHE-RF. Northern blot analysis of human tissues revealed that hNHE-RF is ubiquitously expressed with highest levels in kidney, liver, and pancreas (data not shown). To confirm the interaction of full-length hNHE-RF with merlin, we expressed hNHE-RF with a 5′HA tag in COS-7 cells and tested its ability to bind with different segments of merlin expressed as bacterial GST fusion proteins and immobilized on GSH beads. We detected the bound protein in immunoblots, using the anti-hNHE-RF antibody (NP1). As shown in Fig. 2, hNHE-RF bound specifically to the amino-terminal and full-length merlin fusion proteins, but did not bind to either the carboxyl terminus of merlin or to GST alone. Binding to a mutant merlin, encoding an NF2-associated missense mutation Asn220 → Tyr, is reduced compared with the wild type (Fig. 2, lane 4). Thus, as was predicted by the two-hybrid analysis, hNHE-RF associates with the amino-terminal but not with the carboxyl-terminal domain of merlin. Because the amino-terminal domain of merlin shows significant similarity with ERM proteins, we also examined the interaction of NHE-RF with moesin and radixin. We separated GST-moesin and His-tagged radixin complexes from cell lysates expressing hNHE-RF by affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2, hNHE-RF showed a strong association with the amino termini of both moesin and radixin but not with the carboxyl terminus of either protein. The interaction with full-length radixin (Fig. 2 B) is reduced compared with the amino-terminal domain alone. A similar result has been obtained with full-length moesin (data not shown) although no such difference was noted for merlin (Fig. 2 A). The immobilized amino termini of moesin and radixin completely bound and removed hNHE-RF from the lysate, whereas immobilized merlin, incubated with an equivalent amount of hNHE-RF, bound only a fraction of the protein (Fig. 2). We have also determined the subcellular localization of exogenously expressed hNHE-RF in HeLa cells using immunocytochemistry. hNHE-RF localizes to the ruffling membrane, microvilli, and filopodia reminiscent of the ERM proteins and of overexpressed merlin (Fig.3). When we co-expressed both merlin and hNHE-RF in COS-7 and HeLa cells, we also observed the co-localization of these two proteins in membrane ruffles, microvilli, and filopodia (Fig. 3 A). Double immunostaining of exogenous hNHE-RF and endogenous moesin in HeLa cells revealed co-localization in microvilli, ruffling membrane, and filopodia (Fig. 3 B). However, hNHE-RF does not overlap with merlin and moesin in all microvilli and filopodia, and similarly merlin and moesin are not seen throughout the membrane ruffles where we observe hNHE-RF. The frequent co-localization of hNHE-RF with merlin and moesin is, however, consistent with the interaction of these proteins. We demonstrate here that hNHE-RF, a widely expressed protein whose rabbit homologue was first identified by its involvement in mediating protein kinase A regulation of the renal brush-border Na+-H+ exchanger (18Weinman E.J. Dubinsky W. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) interacts both with merlin and with its close relatives, moesin and radixin from the ERM family. Interestingly, while this manuscript was in preparation, Reczeket al. (19Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretcher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) identified hNHE-RF as a physiologically relevant interactor (which they named EBP50) for ezrin, the third ERM protein. hNHE-RF possesses two PDZ domains, motifs thought to mediate protein-protein interactions, particularly at the plasma membrane during assembly of components involved in cellular signaling (26Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 27Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). E3KARP (also called TKA-1), a protein recently isolated as an interactor for the small intestinal and renal proximal tubule brush-border Na+-H+ exchanger NHE3, shares 51% identity with hNHE-RF primarily in the PDZ domains (28Yun C.H.C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C.-M. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, the interaction with the amino-terminal domain of merlin and the ERM proteins occurs outside of the hNHE-RF PDZ domains, via the carboxyl-terminal region spanning amino acids 290–358. This suggests that the hNHE-RF and its MERM binding partners might participate in a larger complex, one component of which might be a Na+-H+ exchanger. Multiple forms of Na+-H+ exchangers exist in mammalian cells, and at least five of these, designated as NHE1–5, sharing an overall 34–60% amino acid identity have been cloned and characterized (29Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Whereas NHE3 expression is limited to kidney and intestine, NHE1 is a housekeeping protein that is ubiquitously expressed (30Yun C.H.C. Tse C.-M. Nath S.K. Levine S.A. Brant S.R. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; : G1-G11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). NHE1 has been shown to accumulate in membrane ruffles where vinculin, talin, and F-actin are concentrated suggesting that Na+-H+ exchangers are sequestered to these regions by interacting with the cytoskeletal network (31Grinstein S. Woodside M. Waddell T.K. Downey G.P. Orlowski J. Pouyssegur J. Wong D.C.P. Foskett J.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5209-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). NHE1 is necessary for Rho-induced stress fiber formation (32Vexler Z.S. Simons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22281-22284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our demonstration of NHE-RF as a binding partner for MERM family members suggests a potential functional connection with the involvement of Na+-H+ exchange in cytoskeletal rearrangement (Fig. 4). Indeed, a recent study demonstrates that ERM proteins are also essential for Rho- and Rac-induced cytoskeletal changes such as stress fiber assembly, formation of focal adhesions, elaboration of lamellipodia, and membrane ruffling (15Mackay D. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The prospect that MERM-NHE-RF interaction plays a role in these changes and the fact that NHE-RF is expressed in tissues not containing NHE3 raise the question of whether NHE-RF is also capable of regulating other Na+-H+ exchangers, particularly NHE1. Interestingly, increased Na+-H+ exchange has long been known to be associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and neoplastic transformation (33Harguindey S. Pedraz J.L. Canero R.G. Diego J.P.D. Cragoe E.J. Crit. Rev. Oncogene. 1995; 6: 1-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an intriguing possibility that merits investigation is that merlin-NHE-RF interaction is the basis of merlin's tumor suppressor function since failure of the interaction might abrogate regulation of a Na+-H+ exchanger in NF2 target cells and lead to formation of meningiomas and schwannomas.

https://openalex.org/W2003848087,"Centromeres play a critical role in chromosome inheritance but are among the most difficult genomic components to analyze in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a highly detailed molecular structure of a functional centromere in a multicellular organism. The centromere of the Drosophila minichromosome Dp1187 is contained within a 420 kb region of centric heterochromatin. We have used a new approach to characterize the detailed structure of this centromere and found that it is primarily composed of satellites and single, complete transposable elements. In the rest of the Drosophila genome, these satellites and transposable elements are neither unique to the centromeres nor present at all centromeres. We discuss the impact of these results on our understanding of heterochromatin structure and on the determinants of centromere identity and function."

Roughly half of the overall convergence, about 30 to 40 millimeters per year, accumulated on the locked plate interface and can be released in future earthquakes. About 10 to 15 millimeters per year of crustal shortening occurred inland at the sub-Andean foreland fold and thrust belt, indicating that the Andes are continuing to build. Little (5 to 10 millimeters per year) along-trench motion of coastal forearc slivers was observed, despite the oblique convergence."

The response of the human circadian clock to extraocular light exposure was monitored by measurement of body temperature and melatonin concentrations throughout the circadian cycle before and after light pulses presented to the popliteal region (behind the knee). A systematic relation was found between the timing of the light pulse and the magnitude and direction of phase shifts, resulting in the generation of a phase response curve. These findings challenge the belief that mammals are incapable of extraretinal circadian phototransduction and have implications for the development of more effective treatments for sleep and circadian rhythm disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2038183822,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, a key regulatory enzyme in the pathway for endogenous cholesterol synthesis, is a target for negative feedback regulation by cholesterol. The promoter for HMG-CoA synthase contains two binding sites for the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). When cellular sterol levels are low, the SREBPs are released from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, allowing them to translocate to the nucleus and activate SREBP target genes. In all SREBP-regulated promoters studied to date, additional co-regulatory transcription factors are required. In the HMG-CoA synthase promoter there are several potential co-regulatory transcription factor binding sites, including an inverted CCAAT box. A similar element has been shown to function with SREBP to mediate sterol regulation of another gene involved in cholesterol metabolism, farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Here, we show that CCAAT binding factor/nuclear factor Y (CBF/NF-Y) binding to the CCAAT box is required for sterol-regulated transcription of HMG-CoA synthase. The SREBP sites and the inverted CCAAT box are normally separated by 17 base pairs, and we show that increasing this distance results in a decrease in the level of transcriptional regulation by sterols. Furthermore, we provide evidence that there is a direct interaction between CBF/NF-Y and the basic helix-loop-helix-zipper region of SREBP. Interestingly, this interaction does not occur efficiently with any of the isolated subunits and appears to require all three nonidentical CBF/NF-Y subunits in a preassembled complex. Since CBF/NF-Y only binds to DNA when all three subunits are in a complex, this would prevent SREBP from forming nonproductive associations with the individual subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2051416430,"The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTP-binding proteins have been implicated in a wide range of vesicle transport and fusion steps along the secretory pathway. In chromaffin cells, ARF6 is specifically associated with the membrane of secretory chromaffin granules. Since ARF6 is an established regulator of phospholipase D (PLD), we have examined the intracellular distribution of ARF6 and PLD activity in resting and stimulated chromaffin cells. We found that stimulation of intact chromaffin cells or direct elevation of cytosolic calcium in permeabilized cells triggered the rapid translocation of ARF6 from secretory granules to the plasma membrane and the concomitant activation of PLD in the plasma membrane.

PLD could be activated by a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP and by recombinant myristoylated ARF6 and inhibited by specific anti-ARF6 antibodies. Furthermore, a synthetic myristoylated peptide corresponding to the N-terminal domain of ARF6 inhibited both PLD activity and catecholamine secretion in calcium-stimulated chromaffin cells.

Moss J. Vaughan M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Six mammalian family members have been identified which have been classified into three groups according to their size and sequence homology. ARF1, ARF2, and ARF3 form class I, ARF4 and ARF5 form class II, and ARF6 forms class III (1Welsh C.F. Moss J. Vaughan M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 138: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Members of the ARF family are subjected to myristoylation at the N-terminal glycine residue, a lipid co-translational modification that appears essential for functional activity (2Casey P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1994; 6: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). ARFs are ubiquitous among eukaryotes with an amino acid sequence that is highly conserved across diverse species, suggesting a fundamental role in cellular physiology. Indeed, ARF proteins have been implicated in a wide range of vesicle transport and fusion steps along the secretory pathway (3Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 4Boman A.L. Kahn R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 147-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 5Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These include budding, transport, and fusion steps in the Golgi complex, in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the endocytotic and exocytotic pathways. The recent discovery that some members of the ARF family are effective activators of phospholipase D (PLD) has raised the possibility that a novel signal transduction pathway may regulate intracellular membrane traffic (6Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweiss P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 7Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). PLD is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to produce membrane-localized phosphatidic acid (PA) and soluble choline (8Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 329-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In the presence of a primary alcohol, the enzyme can also catalyze a transphosphatidylation reaction that exchanges the polar headgroup of the phospholipid substrate with the given alcohol to form the corresponding phosphatidyl-alcohol (9Kobayashi M. Kanfer J.N. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 1597-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This unique and very useful property of PLD has been used to reveal PLD activation following agonist stimulation in many types of cells and tissues (10Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical evidences suggest that multiple PLD isoenzymes with diverse mechanisms of activation occur in mammalian cells (11Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). An integral membrane-bound PLD that is highly specific for phosphatidylcholine as substrate and is activated by sodium oleate was recently purified (12Okamura S. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31207-31213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several forms of small G protein-dependent PLDs including ARF-sensitive (6Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweiss P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 7Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) and RhoA-sensitive (13Malcolm K.C. Ross A.H. Qiu R.G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25951-25954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isoenzymes have been described. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), another important activator of PLD, seems to be generally required for the small G protein-dependent PLDs (6Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweiss P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 7Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) but not for the oleate-dependent PLD (12Okamura S. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31207-31213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein kinase C appears also as a major regulator of PLD since phorbol esters are among the most effective stimuli of PLD reported in many cell types (11Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To date, several mammalian PLDs have been cloned and sequenced (11Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Acta. 1984; 795: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), pancreatic B cells (16Metz S.A. Dunlop M. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (17Kanoh H. Kanaho Y. Nozawa Y. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1786-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have suggested a role for PLD in exocytosis. In chromaffin cells, however, the occurrence of an agonist-regulated PLD activity remains a controversial issue (18Purkiss J. Murrin R.A. Owen P.J. Boarder M.R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1084-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 19Garcia M.C. Lopez M.G. Garcia A.G. Crespo M.S. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2244-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We recently described a secretory granule-associated ARF6 protein that may represent a key component of the exocytotic pathway in chromaffin cells (20Galas M.C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Since ARF6 is an established regulator of PLD (21Massenburg D. Han J.S. Liyanage M. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we examine here the PLD activity in resting and stimulated chromaffin cells. We found that stimulation of chromaffin cells triggered the rapid translocation of ARF6 from secretory granules to the plasma membrane and the concomitant activation of PLD in the plasma membrane. Both calcium-evoked PLD activation and calcium-induced catecholamine secretion could be inhibited by a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal domain of myristoylated ARF6. We propose that ARF6 may participate in the exocytotic reaction by controlling a plasma membrane-bound PLD and thereby contributing to the generation of fusogenic lipids at the exocytotic sites. Chromaffin cells were isolated from fresh bovine adrenal glands and maintained in primary culture, essentially as described previously (22Vitale N. Mukai H. Rouot B. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14715-14723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were usually cultured as monolayers either on 24 multiple 16-mm Costar plates (Cambridge, MA) at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well or on 100-mm Costar plates at a density of 5 × 106 cells/plate. To trigger exocytosis, chromaffin cells were washed twice with Locke's solution (140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, 0.56 mm ascorbic acid, and 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) and then stimulated 10 min with Locke's solution containing either 10 μm nicotine or 59 mm K+ (made by decreasing NaCl isosmotically). Experiments were carried out at 37 °C on 3–7-day-old cultures. Cultured chromaffin cells were washed four times with Locke's solution and twice with Ca2+-free Locke's solution (containing 1 mm EGTA). Permeabilization was performed with 15 units/ml SLO (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) for 2 min in 200 μl/16-mm well or in 5 ml/100-mm plate Ca2+-free KG medium (150 mmK+-glutamate, 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm nitrilotriacetic acid, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgATP, 4.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2% bovine serum albumin). Cells were subsequently stimulated for 10 min in the presence of the compound to be tested in KG medium containing 20 μm free Ca2+ and 1 mm free Mg2+ (22Vitale N. Mukai H. Rouot B. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14715-14723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Catecholamine stores were labeled by incubating chromaffin cells with [3H]noradrenaline (14.68 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) for 60 min. Cells were then washed four times, permeabilized with SLO, and stimulated with 20 μm free Ca2+as described above. [3H]Noradrenaline release after stimulation was determined by measuring the radioactivity present in the incubation medium and in cells after precipitation with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Release of [3H]noradrenaline is expressed as a percentage of total radioactivity present in the cells before Ca2+-induced stimulation. Release experiments were performed in triplicate on at least two different cell preparations. In the figures that are representative of a typical experiment, data are given as the mean of triplicate determinations on the same cell preparation ± S.E. Endogenous catecholamine release was estimated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection as described previously (23Vitale N. Deloulme J.C. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30293-30298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured chromaffin cells were collected in 0.32m sucrose, Tris 10 mm, pH 7.4, homogenized, and then centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, the pellet containing the crude membrane fraction was resuspended in 0.32m sucrose (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4), layered on a continuous sucrose density gradient (1–2.2 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4), and centrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 × g. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top to the bottom and analyzed for PLD activity and protein content by the Bradford procedure. The distribution of dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DβH; chromaffin granule marker) and Na+/K+ATPase (plasma membrane marker) in the fractions of the gradient was estimated as described previously (24Vitale N. Gensse M. Chasserot-Golas S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Plasma membranes were purified from fractions 2 and 3, which contained the highest Na+/K+ ATPase activity. Fractions were diluted 10 times in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and membranes were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 ×g. Chromaffin cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [9,10-3H]myristic acid for 24 h at 37 °C. Labeled cells were then washed, stimulated with nicotine or 59 mmK+ in the presence of 1% ethanol or permeabilized with SLO, and then stimulated with 20 μm free Ca2+in the presence of 1% ethanol. Cells were subsequently collected and lipids extracted and separated with CH3OH/CHCl3/0.1 n HCl (1:1:1, v/v/v) according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43117) Google Scholar). The lower lipid-containing phase was collected, spiked with a mixture of standard lipids containing l-α phosphatidic acid (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate) (PA) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-3-phosphoethanol (PEt), dried under vacuum, and redissolved in 20 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v). Lipids were separated on one-dimensional TLC 0.25-mm oxalate-coated silica gel plates in a solvent system composed of CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COOH/H2O (75:45:3:1, v/v/v/v). Labeled phospholipids were visualized with tritium imaging plates using the FUJIX BAS1000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). Standard lipids were stained with iodine vapor.R F values were 0.31 for PA and 0.67 for PEt. ARF-dependent phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis in purified plasma membranes was determined according to the procedure previously described by Brown et al. (6Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweiss P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) in the presence of MgCl2 and 0.4 m NaCl to favor the nucleotide exchange on ARF. The reaction was carried out in a final volume of 60 μl. All assays contained 6.25 μg of plasma membrane proteins in buffer A (50 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.5, 3 mm EGTA, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm MgATP, 400 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). When indicated, 30 μm GTPγS and 1 μmrecombinant myristoylated ARF6 were included. The membranes and the above constituents in a volume of 34 μl were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was subsequently started by the addition of 24 μl of lipid substrate and 1% ethanol. The final concentration of lipids in the assay were 135 μm PE, 12 μmPIP2, 8 μm phosphatidylcholine (PC), and 1 μCi of l-α-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H-labeled). Lipids were previously dried and sonicated in buffer A without MgCl2and CaCl2. The incubation was performed for 30 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 350 μl of 1 mHCl, 5 mm EGTA, and 1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/HCL (50:50:0.3, v/v/v). After vortexing and centrifugation (2000 × g for 5 min), 400 μl of the aqueous phase was extracted and analyzed as described above. Polyclonal anti-ARF6 antibodies were raised in rabbits against bacterially overexpressed ARF6 protein. This antibody was a generous gift from Dr. J. B. Helms (Ruprecht-Karls-Universität, Heidelberg, Germany). The rabbit polyclonal anti-dopamine β-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.17.1) antiserum was prepared in our laboratory, and its specificity has been demonstrated (26Sontag J.M. Aunis D. Bader M.F Eur. J. Cell. Biol. 1988; 46: 316-326PubMed Google Scholar). Myristoylated (myrARF6-(2–13)) and non-myristoylated (ARF6-(2–13)) N-terminal ARF6 peptides (GKVLSKIFGNKE), and myristoylated (myrARF1-(2–17)) N-terminal ARF1 peptide (GNIFANLFKGLFGKKE) were synthesized in our laboratory using the 432A peptide Synthesizer SYNERGY (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Purity was checked by high performance liquid chromatography. Sequence analysis was performed by Edman degradation on an automated Applied Biosystems 473A gas phase protein microsequencer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK), and mass spectrometry was used to assess the structure of the final product. Recombinant myristoylated ARF6 protein (rARF6) was produced in a bacterial expression system containing theN-myristoyltransferase in the plasmid pACYC177/ET3d, and purified according to the procedure previously described by Haunet al. (27Haun R.S. Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7064-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was routinely determined using the Bradford procedure with Bio-Rad dye reagent and bovine serum albumin as standard. One dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 12% acrylamide gel in Tris-glycine buffer (24Vitale N. Gensse M. Chasserot-Golas S. Aunis D. Bader M.F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1275-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets at a constant current of 120 mV for 1 h. Blots were developed with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham, Les Ulis, France), and immunoreactive bands were detected with the ECL system (Amersham). To measure PLD activity, we made use of the specific transphosphatidylation reaction in which the phospholipid headgroup is exchanged for ethanol, producing PEt at the expense of PA. Therefore, cultured chromaffin cells were labeled with [3H]myristic acid. Preliminary time-course experiments indicated that maximal incorporation of the radioactivity in total lipids occurred after 20 h of incubation. [3H]Myristic acid was predominantly incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (data not shown), which represents the major PLD substrate (10Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of [3H]myristic acid labeled chromaffin cells with nicotine or with a depolarizing concentration of potassium triggered the formation of [3H]PA and [3H]PEt in the presence of 1% ethanol (Table I). Both secretagogues elicited a similar increase in PA and PEt levels, suggesting that an agonist-stimulated phospholipase D activity was present in chromaffin cells.Table IEffect of secretagogues on phospholipase D activity in chromaffin cells[3H]PA[3H]PEtcpmRatio stimulated/basalcpmRatio stimulated/basalLocke718 ± 85100 ± 11279 ± 71100 ± 26Nicotine (10 μm)1430 ± 106185 ± 6497 ± 38166 ± 6K+ (59 mm)1301 ± 23171 ± 7556 ± 20189 ± 18 Open table in a new tab To investigate the mechanisms of activation of PLD, chromaffin cells were permeabilized with SLO to clamp cytosolic Ca2+ at known values and to control the cytosolic levels of nucleotides. Permeabilized cells were maintained under resting conditions or stimulated with 20 μm Ca2+ in the presence of 5 mm MgATP and 1% ethanol. We found that calcium strongly stimulated the formation of both [3H]PEt (Fig.1) and [3H]PA (data not shown), suggesting that PLD activation might be a component of the calcium signaling cascade in stimulated chromaffin cells. PLD can be activated by protein kinase C in many cell types (11Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We looked, therefore, at the effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at 100 nm, a concentration known to give maximal stimulation of protein kinase C in chromaffin cells (28Bader M.F. Sontag J.M. Thiersé D. Aunis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16426-16434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, as seen in Fig. 1, PMA was unable to significantly modify the basal or the calcium-evoked formation of [3H]PEt in SLO-permeabilized chromaffin cells, indicating that PLD is not modulated by a protein kinase C-dependent pathway. In agreement, Purkiss et al. (18Purkiss J. Murrin R.A. Owen P.J. Boarder M.R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1084-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) previously reported that neither bradykinin nor 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulated PLD in intact chromaffin cells. Current evidence supports the existence of two types of PLD activities: an oleate-dependent form and a form modulated by monomeric GTP-binding proteins (21Massenburg D. Han J.S. Liyanage M. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To probe the involvement of a GTP-binding protein in the calcium-evoked PLD activation, we introduced a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP into SLO-permeabilized chromaffin cells. Fig. 1 shows that GTPγS at 20 μm produced a large increase in the Ca2+-dependent PLD activity, revealing that a G protein probably regulates PLD in chromaffin cells. In contrast, AlF4−, which selectively activates trimeric G proteins (29Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15595-15597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibited the Ca2+-dependent PLD activity in SLO-permeabilized cells by more than 80% (Fig. 1). Taken together, these findings suggest that the Ca2+-dependent PLD activity in chromaffin cells might be regulated by both monomeric and heterotrimeric G proteins. To determine the intracellular localization of the PLD activity in stimulated chromaffin cells, we analyzed the phospholipid content of subcellular fractions collected from a sucrose density gradient layered with a crude membrane preparation. Chromaffin cells labeled with [3H]myristic acid were permeabilized with SLO and subsequently exposed to 1% ethanol and GTPγS in the presence or absence of 20 μm free Ca2+. Cells were then collected and processed for subcellular fractionation. As expected, the [3H]PEt levels detected in the fractions obtained from resting cells remained negligible (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, radioactive [3H]PEt was essentially collected in fractions 2 and 3 in gradients prepared from stimulated cells (Fig.2 A). These fractions contain plasma membranes as estimated by the Na+/K+-ATPase activity. It is noteworthy that fractions 11 and 12, enriched in chromaffin granules revealed by the peak of DβH, contain very little radioactive [3H]PEt in both resting and stimulated cells. In other words, PLD activity in chromaffin cells is not associated with secretory granules. However, a rise in cytosolic calcium triggers the activation of a G protein-regulated PLD activity, essentially in the plasma membrane of chromaffin cells. We previously reported that ARF6 is specifically associated with secretory granule membranes in chromaffin cells, most likely through an interaction with the β subunit of a granule-bound trimeric G protein (20Galas M.C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Stimulation of chromaffin cells with nicotine or direct elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ in permeabilized cells triggered the rapid dissociation of ARF6 from secretory granules (20Galas M.C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To identify the target membrane to which ARF6 translocates in stimulated cells, we compared here the distribution of ARF6 in membrane fractions collected from resting or nicotine-stimulated chromaffin cells. Fig.2 B illustrates an immunoreplica analysis, using an anti-ARF6 antibody, of fractions collected from a sucrose density gradient layered with chromaffin cell crude membranes. The parallel distribution of ARF6 immunoreactivity and DβH activity (Fig. 2, compareA and B) confirms the specific association of ARF6 with chromaffin granule membranes in resting cells, in agreement with our previous observations (20Galas M.C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. Thiersé D. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2788-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Stimulation of chromaffin cells with 10 μm nicotine for 5 min completely modified the distribution of ARF6 in the sucrose gradient since the highest immunosignal for ARF6 was then detected in fraction 3 containing the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained in gradients prepared from SLO-permeabilized cells stimulated by a rise in cytosolic calcium (Fig. 4). These findings strongly suggest that ARF6 translocates from secretory granules to the plasma membrane upon chromaffin cell stimulation. The recent identification of PLD as a possible effector of ARF proteins (6Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweiss P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 7Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) led us to investigate whether PLD might be activated by an ARF6-dependent pathway in chromaffin cell plasma membranes. To probe the existence of an ARF6-dependent PLD in chromaffin cells, we first examined the effect of recombinant ARF6 on PLD activity associated with purified plasma membranes. Plasma membranes recovered from a sucrose density gradient were assayed for PLD activity using lipid vesicles labeled with [3H]dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the presence of 30 μm GTPγS did not significantly increase the plasma membrane-associated PLD activity estimated by the formation of [3H]PA and [3H]PEt. However, addition of 1 μm myristoylated recombinant ARF6 together with 30 μm GTPγS stimulated the formation of [3H]PEt by approximately 135%. These results indicate that the plasma membrane-associated PLD can be activated by myrARF6 in chromaffin cells. To further correlate the PLD activity with the presence of ARF6 in the plasma membrane, we compared the PLD activity in plasma membranes purified from either resting or stimulated SLO-permeabilized chromaffin cells. The amount of ARF6 in the two membrane preparations was quantified by immunodetection on nitrocellulose sheets using specific anti-ARF6 antibodies. As shown in Fig.4 A, stimulation with 20 μm free Ca2+ strongly enhanced the quantity of ARF6 associated with the plasma membrane. We then compared the PLD activity in the two plasma membrane fractions by measuring the GTPγS-dependent formation of [3H]PEt (Fig.4 B). We found that the translocation of ARF6 in stimulated cells was accompanied by a significant increase in the GTP-dependent PLD activity in the plasma membrane (Fig.4 B), suggesting that endogenous ARF6 was able to activate the plasma membrane-associated PLD. Accordingly, the GTP-dependent PLD activity measured in plasma membranes from stimulated cells could be totally reversed by anti-ARF6 antibodies (Fig. 4). These findings are in line with the idea that, in stimulated chromaffin cells, ARF6 translocates from secretory granules to the plasma membrane to activate a plasma membrane-bound PLD. Fig.5 illustrates the time course and calcium dose-response curve for secretion and PLD activation in SLO-permeabilized chromaffin cells. Secretion was estimated by measuring the release of endogenous catecholamines, and PLD activity was detected by measuring the formation of labeled PEt and PA. We found a strong similarity between the calcium sensitivity for PLD activation and the calcium concentration required for the exocytotic reaction in permeabilized cells (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, time-course experiments revealed that catecholamine secretion was always accompanied by the formation of PEt (Fig. 5 B), in agreement with the hypothesis that PLD activation represents an important event in the pathway of regulated exocytosis. We previously reported that translocation of ARF6 was maximal within 1 min of stimulation (20Galas M.C. Helms J.B. Vitale N. T"

The mechanisms that regulate CKIε activity and substrate specificity are not well understood. We report that CKIε, which contains a highly phosphorylated 123-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension not present in CKIα, is substantially less active than CKIα in phosphorylating a number of substrates including SV40 large T antigen and is unable to inhibit the initiation of SV40 DNA replication. Two mechanisms for the activation of CKIε have been identified. First, limited tryptic digestion of CKIε produces a protease-resistant amino-terminal 39-kDa core kinase with several-fold enhanced activity. Second, phosphatase treatment of CKIε activates CKIε 5–20-fold toward T antigen. Similar treatment of a truncated form of CKIε produced only a 2-fold activation. Notably, this activation was transient; reautophosphorylation led to a rapid down-regulation of the kinase within 5 min. Phosphatase treatment also activated CKIε toward the novel substrates IκBα and Ets-1. These mechanisms may serve to regulate CKIε and related forms of CKI in the cell, perhaps in response to DNA damage.

Two subgroups of the CKI family have been separated by functional analysis and complementation of mutations in yeast. One group encoding nuclear kinases appears in yeast to be involved in the response to DNA damage. Mutations in these genes, including HRR25 and YCK3in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and hhp1 andhhp2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, lead to sensitivity to DNA damaging agents such as x-rays and methyl methanesulfonate (1Dhillon N.

The mammalian genes encoding CKIδ and CKIε complement HRR25-deleted yeast, suggesting they too may be involved in DNA repair pathways (5Fish K. Cegielska A. Getman M. Landes G. Virshup D.M. J. Biol.

The structure of the CKI family suggests several potential mechanisms for the regulation of activity. All family members contain a short amino-terminal domain of 9–76 amino acids, a highly conserved kinase domain of 284 amino acids, and a highly variable carboxyl-terminal domain that ranges from 24 to more than 200 amino acids in length. The carboxyl terminus of a CKI isoform may serve several functions, including regulation of substrate recognition, modulation of catalytic activity, and/or determination of kinase subcellular localization. Prenylation of the tail of the YCK1/YCK2 family has been shown to be of functional importance in yeast (3Wang X.M. Hoekstra M.F. DeMaggio A.J. Dhillon N. Vancura A. Kuret J. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A.

Phosphorylation of CKI may also be an important regulatory mechanism. Most of the CKI proteins are phosphoproteins, and several of the yeast kinases can autophosphorylate on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (10Hoekstra M.F. Dhillon N. Carmel G. DeMaggio A.J. Lindberg R.A. Hunter T. Kuret J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Studies using synthetic substrates and the artificial substrate casein have indicated that these phosphoryl residues may inhibit kinase activity (11Carmel G. Leichus B. Cheng X. Patterson S.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7304-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that an unphosphorylated truncation of Cki1 containing only the kinase domain was twice as active as the phosphorylated form, whereas Graveset al. (12Graves P.R. Haas D.W. Hagedorn C.H. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6394-6401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mapped a phosphorylation-dependent inhibitory domain in CKIδ to a 26-amino acid domain in the carboxyl-terminal tail. Polyanions such as heparin can regulate kinase activity; activation by heparin appears dependent on the presence or absence of the carboxyl-terminal domain (12Graves P.R. Haas D.W. Hagedorn C.H.

Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Additionally, membrane bound forms of the kinase may be regulated by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (14Bazenet C.E. Brockman J.L. Lewis D. Chan C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7369-7376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One in vitro functional assay of CKI activity is its ability to phosphorylate simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen. We have previously shown that CKIα purified from HeLa cell extracts phosphorylates T antigen on physiologic sites and inhibits the initiation of viral DNA replication (15Cegielska A. Moarefi I. Fanning E. Virshup D.M. J. Virology. 1994; 68: 269-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cegielska A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell.

As SV40 DNA replication is regulated in the cell cycle and by DNA damage (18Roberts J.M. D'Urso G. Science. 1988; 241: 1486-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Liu V.F. Weaver D.T. Mol.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3891-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether forms of CKI implicated in DNA repair pathways could also regulate in vitro DNA replication. We have now overexpressed and purified active CKIε. The data show that this form of CKI, although active on peptide substrates, is markedly hindered in its ability to phosphorylate and inhibit the origin unwinding function of T antigen. This decreased activity of CKIε is apparently due to an inhibitory effect of the carboxyl-terminal domain not present in CKIα, since limited tryptic digestion of CKIε released a catalytically active amino-terminal 39-kDa fragment able to both phosphorylate T antigen and inhibit its replication initiation function. We also report that CKIε is activated by dephosphorylation in a tail-dependent manner. Treatment of recombinant CKIε with the catalytic subunits of PP1, PP2A, or PP2B (calcineurin) leads to as much as a 20-fold increase in activity toward T antigen, casein, and two novel substrates, the Ets-1 transcription factor and recombinant IκBα. Activation of the kinase by phosphatases was transient and self-limited; reautophosphorylation of the kinase led to inactivation within 5 min. Activation was dependent on the presence of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the kinase; a truncation mutant of CKIε was activated by phosphatase 4-fold less than was full-length kinase. These findings support the hypothesis that the carboxyl-terminal domain of CKIε inhibits its activity on key protein substrates and suggests that in the cell, CKIε may be regulated in a self-limited manner by phosphatases and in a more sustained manner by intracellular proteolysis. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose was obtained from Qiagen. Trypsin (T8642), calcineurin, and calmodulin were from Sigma. PP1c and inhibitor 2 were from New England Biolabs. Okadaic acid was from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes were from Life Technologies, Inc. and New England Biolabs. Plasmids expressing IκBα (22Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were the generous gift of John Hiscott. The cDNA encoding wild type human CKIε was isolated as aNcoI/SalI 1333-base pair fragment and ligated into NcoI/XhoI-digested pET16b (a T7-based expression vector from Novagen) as described previously (5Fish K.

This construct (pKF115) removes the hexahistidine sequence present in the pET16b vector downstream from the NcoI site. The 1317-base pair NcoI/HindIII fragment from pKF115 was ligated into the same sites in pRSET-B (a T7-based expression vector from Invitrogen). This construct (pV71) encodes CKIε with a 41-amino acid amino-terminal fusion that contains a hexahistidine tag and an enterokinase cleavage site. The d305 truncation mutant was created by the introduction of a stop codon after amino acid 305 in a derivative of pV71 (pKF162) by site-directed mutagenesis. All recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 37 °C to anA 600 of 0.3 and induced overnight at 28 °C with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Hexahistidine-tagged CKIε was expressed at low levels in BL21(DE3) cells. Lysates in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 10% sucrose (buffer B) with 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin were applied to DEAE-cellulose and batch-eluted with the same buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. Kinase-containing fractions were dialyzed into buffer B with 10 mm NaCl and then applied to a S-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. Kinase activity was batch-eluted with buffer B with 250 mmNaCl (without EDTA or DTT) and loaded directly onto Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose from which it was eluted with buffer B (without EDTA or DTT) containing 80 mmimidazole. Untagged CKIε was purified by a similar procedure except that the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose step was omitted. The typical yield was 100 μg of CKIε from a 2-liter culture. Hexahistidine-tagged CKIε was used in all assays except where specifically indicated. Histidine-tagged and untagged kinase were found to behave identically in all assays tested. Proteolysis of purified wild type and hexahistidine-tagged CKIε was performed in the standard kinase reaction buffer (30 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmDTT for 30 °C for 15 min either without or with previous autophosphorylation of substrate. Trypsin was then inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Proteolysis with trypsin at 1 μg/ml gave almost quantitative scission of CKIε into its major digestion products; this concentration of trypsin was routinely used for the production of the active tryptic fragment. For immunoblot analysis, proteins and trypsin-generated peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 17% gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in 12.5 mmTris, 86 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 0.1% SDS, 20% methanol. After a 15-min fixation in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, the membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with a 1:500 dilution of UT31 antiserum raised against the amino-terminal CKIε peptide MELRVGNKYRLGC (5Fish K.

Immunoreactive peptides were detected using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) followed by incubation with bromo-chloro-indolylphosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium (24Harlow E.

Kinase reactions were performed in buffer containing 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 150 or 250 μm ATP, and 1–5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C or as indicated. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described previously (15Cegielska A. Moarefi I. Fanning E. Virshup D.M. J.

Peptide phosphorylation reactions contained the synthetic 15-mer phosphopeptide substrate AHALS(P)VASLPGLKKK (termed 5P) that was synthesized with the serine in position 5 phosphorylated. This peptide contains a CKI consensus site and is phosphorylated by both CKIα and CKIε with a K m of approximately 200 μm. 2A. Cegielska, E. Vielhaber and D. M. Virshup, unpublished results. Peptide kinase assays were terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 30% acetic acid/10 μl assay and quantitated by spotting the reaction mixture onto P81 phosphocellulose filters as described (25Casnellie J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). All phosphatase reactions were performed in 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin unless otherwise noted. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). In previous studies we purified CKIα based on its ability to phosphorylate SV40 large T antigen and thus inhibit the initiation of SV40 DNA replication (15Cegielska A. Moarefi I. Fanning E. Virshup D.M. J. Virology. 1994; 68: 269-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cegielska A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the process of characterizing human CKI genes, we cloned a novel member of the CKI family, CKIε, that encodes a 48-kDa kinase (5Fish K. Cegielska A. Getman M. Landes G. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CKIε was of interest because, unlike CKIα, it was able to functionally complement yeast deleted for the DNA repair-related kinase HRR25. In preliminary studies on recombinant CKIε, we found virtually identical specific activity to CKIα when tested on peptide substrates (data not shown). However, although CKIα was found to readily phosphorylate T antigen, CKIε was approximately 9-fold less active on this protein substrate (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained when a partially purified non-tagged form of CKIε was tested (data not shown), indicating the histidine tag has no significant effect on the ability of CKIε to phosphorylate T antigen. Interestingly, CKIε autophosphorylation was also consistently stimulated severalfold by the addition of T antigen (Fig. 1, lane 4 compared withlanes 5 and 6), suggesting a specific protein-protein interaction between the carboxyl-terminal domain and the substrate. CKIε and CKIα are closely related in the kinase domain (86% similar and 74% identical) but differ in the length of the carboxyl-terminal tail. CKIα has only a 24-amino acid extension beyond the kinase domain, whereas CKIε has a 123-amino acid tail. Recent studies of carboxyl-terminal domains in the related kinases CKIδ and Cki1 have indicated that they perform a regulatory function (11Carmel G. Leichus B. Cheng X. Patterson S.D. Mirza U. Chait B.T. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7304-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol.

The differing activities of the CKIα and CKIε isoforms suggested that the carboxyl-terminal domain of CKIε was responsible for the decreased activity of the kinase on T antigen and secondly, that this region might form a discrete structure separable from the kinase domain by limited proteolysis. To test this, intact autophosphorylated CKIε was subjected to limited digestion with various concentrations (0–5 μg/ml) of trypsin. As demonstrated in Fig.2, digestion of32P-autophosphorylated CKIε with increasing amounts of trypsin results in the production of a series of higher mobility species that are further digested to a relatively stable 39-kDa phosphoprotein that finally disappears during incubation at the highest trypsin concentration (5 μg/ml). This 39-kDa product appears to be activated CKIε since (a) its appearance coincided with a 3-fold increase in kinase activity toward T antigen, (b) it reacts with polyclonal antibody UT31 that recognizes the amino terminus of CKIε, and (c) the purified 39-kDa polypeptide retains kinase activity (Fig. 3 and data not shown). The 3-fold activation achieved by trypsin treatment may under-represent the actual activation since (a) there may have been partial loss of the kinase domain as well, and (b) proteolytic tail fragments may retain some inhibitory activity (data not shown). These results suggest that CKIε contains a discrete inhibitory domain that blocks specific substrate phosphorylation.Figure 3Tryptic removal of the carboxyl terminus partially restores the replication inhibitory activity of CKIε. A, inhibition of unwinding by CKIα, CKIε, and CKIε-39. SV40 large T antigen was preincubated either alone or with the various forms of CKI and then assayed for its ability to unwind the SV40 origin of replication as described previously (16Cegielska A.

CKIα inhibits T antigen function by phosphorylating it on at least two inhibitory sites, serines 120 and 123 (15Cegielska A. Moarefi I. Fanning E. Virshup D.M. J. Virology. 1994; 68: 269-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cegielska A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The finding that proteolytic cleavage of CKIε stimulated its activity on T antigen led to the further functional characterization of the 39-kDa tryptic fragment. Specifically, we wished to determine whether its increased protein kinase activity translated into an increased ability to inhibit T antigen-catalyzed SV40 origin unwinding. CKIα, CKIε, and the 39-kDa CKIε fragment (CKIε-39) were pre-incubated with T antigen and ATP, and then T antigen-dependent unwinding of the SV40 minimal origin of replication was assayed (Fig. 3). As previously demonstrated, phosphorylation of T antigen by CKIα inhibited its origin unwinding activity with 50% inhibition occurring at about 0.4 pmol of kinase/reaction (40 nm in the preincubation mixture). In contrast, CKIε very inefficiently inhibited the origin unwinding activity of T antigen with 50% inhibition occurring at about 7 pmol of kinase/reaction (700 nm in preincubation mixture). The 39-kDa fragment of CKIε was substantially more active than full-length CKIε, producing 50% inhibition of T antigen origin unwinding activity at about 0.9 pmol of kinase/reaction (90 nm in preincubation mixture, Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that the catalytic core of CKIε is in fact similar in activity to CKIα and that proteolytic removal of the carboxyl terminus of CKIε partially activates it to phosphorylate the same or similar inhibitory sites on T antigen. Recent studies on the related CKI isoform CKIδ have demonstrated that the full-length kinase can be activated 2–5-fold toward casein or a synthetic peptide (D4) by treatment with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) (27Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We tested whether removal of phosphoryl groups from CKIε stimulated its kinase activity toward SV40 large T antigen (Fig.4, A and B). Purified CKIε was incubated with increasing amounts of the catalytic subunit of either PP1 or PP2A. At the end of the dephosphorylation reaction, okadaic acid was added to a final concentration of 250 nm, and the activity of the kinase on T antigen was assessed. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, A and B, pretreatment of CKIε with either phosphatase stimulates its activity on T antigen up to 20-fold, with half-maximal activation occurring with less than 2 ng (∼4 nm) of PP2Ac. The stimulation requires phosphatase catalytic activity, since inclusion of okadaic acid in the preincubation fully blocks the effect of PP2Ac (Fig. 4 A, lane 7). The activation by 16 ng (∼30 nm) of PP1c is only partially blocked by 250 nm okadaic acid, a not unexpected result since PP1c is 10–100-fold less sensitive than PP2Ac to inhibition by okadaic acid. Of note, alterations in the phosphorylation state of CKIε had a significant effect on kinase mobility (Fig. 4 A). This appears to be due to tail phosphorylation, as truncated CKIε can autophosphorylate without a significant change in electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 7 A and data not shown).Figure 7The carboxyl terminus of CKIε is the major determinant of PP2Ac-mediated activation. A andB, PP2Ac activated CKIε 9.1-fold and CKIε-d305 2.0-fold toward T antigen. 85 ng each of CKIε (lanes 1 and 2) or CKIε-d305 (lanes 3 and 4) lacking the carboxyl-terminal 111 amino acids of CKIε were incubated without (lanes 1 and 3) or with (lanes 2 and 4) 8 ng of PP2Acfor 15 min at 37 °C before the addition of okadaic acid, T antigen, and [γ-32P]ATP for a 3-min kinase reaction.

The kinase reactions were identical to those above but lasted only 2 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CKIε is capable of autophosphorylation of up to approximately 12 mol/mol (Fig.4 C and see below). Since phosphatase treatment of the bacterially expressed kinase leads to marked activation toward protein substrates, we asked how rapidly reautophosphorylation of the kinase occurs and whether this reautophosphorylation correlates with a decrease in protein kinase activity. CKIε was dephosphorylated with PP2Ac and then allowed to reautophosphorylate in the presence of okadaic acid. T antigen was either added at the same time as [γ-32P]ATP (time 0) or at the indicated times after ATP addition. As Fig. 5 demonstrates, CKIε reautophosphorylation was complete within 5 min, coincident with the re-suppression of kinase activity. Thus, CKIε appears to re-autophosphorylate and autoinhibit itself rapidly in the absence of phosphatase activity. Dilution studies and experiments with CKIε kinase dead mutants indicate that CKIε autophosphorylation is entirely intramolecular (data not shown). Of note, neither activation nor autoinhibition of kinase activity toward a peptide substrate was seen in similar time course reactions (data not shown), suggesting autoinhibition is effective toward protein but not peptide substrates. Dephosphorylation of bacterially expressed CKIε had a significant activating effect on the kinase. To determine the number of phosphates on CKIε that contribute to kinase inhibition, CKIε autophosphorylation was quantitated after pretreatment with increasing amounts of PP2Ac or PP1c (Fig. 4 C). Untreated kinase was able to add about 2.5 mol of phosphate/mol of kinase, whereas PP2Ac-treated kinase added about 12 mol/mol. These data suggest that the kinase was close to maximally autophosphorylated at approximately 10 mol/mol when it was purified from E. coli. Half-maximal activation of the kinase toward T antigen was seen when the kinase added approximately 8 mol/mol, suggesting that 4 mol/mol of phosphate had not been removed by the pretreatment. Similar results were seen with PP1c. Phosphoamino acid analysis performed on CKIε pretreated with PP2Ac and autophosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP indicates that autophosphorylation occurs on both serine and threonine residues (data not shown). Although CKI family members have been shown to be able to autophosphorylate on tyrosine as well as on serine and threonine (10Hoekstra M.F. Dhillon N. Carmel G. DeMaggio A.J. Lindberg R.A. Hunter T. Kuret J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the autophosphorylation experiments in this study address only serine and threonine phosphorylation as the phosphatases used are serine-/threonine-specific. The data indicate that removal of phosphoryl groups from serine and threonine but not tyrosine residues is responsible for the activation of the kinase. To determine whether dephosphorylation of CKIε activated it toward multiple protein substrates, the kinase was tested using casein, replication protein A (the gift of Marc Wold, U. Iowa), and recombinant Ets-1 (the gift of Barbara Graves, U. Utah) as substrates. As demonstrated in Fig.6 A, CKIε is activated toward T antigen, casein, and Ets-1 but not replication protein A (RP-A) by PP2Ac treatment. Similarly, treatment of CKIε with PP1, PP2A, or PP2B catalytic subunit activated the kinase toward GST-IκBα (Fig. 6 B). The activation of CKIε by phosphatases is therefore a general phenomenon. Whereas CKI substrate specificity on peptides can be determined by phosphoryl groups, we note that the increase in activity occurs toward unphosphorylated (bacterially produced Ets-1 and GST-IκBα) as well as phosphorylated (T antigen) proteins. Although genetic studies have suggested a role for CKIε-related proteins in DNA damage response pathways, few physiologic"

Chem. 1996; 271: 23588-23593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Two distinct EphB1 subdomains are involved. The Grb10 SH2 domain binds EphB1 through Tyr929 (17Ooi J.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar), a residue within the conserved, carboxyl-terminal sterile α motif that is shared among all Eph family receptors and a wide range of other signaling proteins (18Schultz J.

Cells were lysed at 4 °C in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 100 μmsodium-o-vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg ml−1 aprotinin, 0.5 μg ml−1 leupeptin), and lysates were clarified by centrifugation. Endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-JNK antibody (Santa Cruz) as described (28Westwick J.K. Brenner D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 342-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). GST-c-Jun (1–135) was used as a substrate in kinase reactions (29Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmand M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Reaction products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilin-P (Millipore), and subjected to autoradiography. Equal loading of GST-c-Jun (kinase substrate) was verified by Amido Black staining, and equal recovery of JNK antigen was confirmed by immunoblot using rabbit anti-JNK (Santa Cruz). Following autoradiography, stained substrate bands were subjected to either scintillation counting or PhosphorImager analysis. Six-well plates (Falcon) were coated with thin layers of fibronectin (0.5 μg cm−2) as described (30Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3579-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Growth medium was replaced 24 h before harvest with binding medium, α-minimum essential medium containing 1% bovine albumin. Transfected cells were recovered by brief trypsinization, washed three times with binding medium, and then plated at 1 × 105 cells/well. Preclustered ephrin B1/Fc (500 ng ml−1 ephrin B1/Fc + 50 ng ml−1 anti-Fc) was added coincident with plating. After 90 min, unattached cells were dislodged by applying four brisk slaps of the plate on a horizontal surface. The attached cell layer was carefully washed once with phosphate-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium to collect the remaining unattached cells. Adherent cells were collected by incubation in Dispase as described (Collaborative Biomedical Products), recovered by centrifugation, and washed, and the viable cells were counted. The ratio of attached to total number of cells recovered was calculated for each of three wells. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. and are representative of three independent experiments. To identify signaling molecules that interact with EphB1, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen of a murine embryonic day 9.5 and 10.5 cDNA library using the cytoplasmic domain of EphB1 (amino acids 556–985) (16Stein E. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23588-23593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Among 290 clones selected, 93 independent partial cDNAs were sequenced; of these, 6 included nonidentical overlapping cDNA fragments that encode the SH2 domain of Nck (19Lehman J.R. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The Nck domains recovered as independent clones are represented in Fig. 1 A. To evaluate the biochemical basis for the EphB1-Nck interaction, we generated a number of mutations in the EphB1cy bait. Shown in Fig. 1 B, an intact EphB1cy tyrosine kinase function was required for Nck binding. Mutation of the ATP-binding lysine (K652R) interrupted the two-hybrid interaction. This finding is consistent with role of SH2 domains in binding phosphotyrosine-containing peptides (31Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). To further define the site at which Nck binds EphB1, we created a series of EphB1cy domain deletions, including removal of the juxtamembrane domain (pLexA-EphB1cyΔJM), the carboxyl-terminal domain (pLexA-EphB1cyΔCterm), or both (pLexA-EphB1cyΔJM/Cterm) (16Stein E. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23588-23593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In each case, the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain was retained to permit generation of an SH2 binding site through tyrosine self-phosphorylation. The juxtamembrane domain (amino acids 556–617) of EphB1cy was required for Nck interaction (Fig. 1 B). Based on published data showing that the Nck-SH2 domain preferentially binds tyrosine phosphopeptides with the sequence (Tyr(P)-hydrophilic-hydrophilic-Pro) (31Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar), we used site-directed mutagenesis to evaluate the two candidate tyrosine residues of EphB1cy within the juxtamembrane domain, Tyr594 and Tyr600. A single substitution, Y594F, disrupted the two-hybrid interaction between EphB1cyand the Nck SH2 domain. The second consensus site, EphB1cyY600, appears not to be required for the interaction (Fig. 1 B). Like Eph receptors, recent studies have implicated Nck in neural targeting. Disordered retinal neuron assembly was observed when the Drosophila Nck homologue, DOCK, was disrupted (32Garrity P. Rao Y. Salecker I. McGlade J. Pawson T. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig. 1 C, a DOCK fusion (22Clemens J.C. Ursuliak Z. Clemens K.K. Price J.V. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17002-17005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) interacts with EphB1cy bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Like Nck, the DOCK interaction requires both intact EphB1 tyrosine kinase function and Tyr594. To evaluate the significance of these yeast two-hybrid results, we tested whether Nck co-precipitates with EphB1 following ligand activation in cells that express endogenous EphB1, HRMEC (23Martin M.M. Schoecklmann H.O. Foster G. Barley-Maloney L. McKanna J. Daniel T.O. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1997; 33: 261-269Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and P19 embryonal carcinoma cells (33Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. BioEssays. 1994; 15: 343-348Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). EphB1 binds and is activated by ephrin B1/Fc (LERK-2/Fc) (34Beckmann M.P. Cerretti D.P. Baum P. Vanden Bos T. James L. Farrah T. Kozlosky C. Hollingsworth T. Shilling H. Maraskovsky E. Fletcher F.A. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Lyman S.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3757-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar,35Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 226: 816-819Crossref Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Because previous reports have demonstrated differences in response to ephrin B1/Fc, depending upon whether it is presented as a dimer or as an anti-Fc clustered multimer (5Wang H.U. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 383-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar),2 both were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2 A, ephrin B1/Fc (dimeric and clustered multimer) stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EphB1. Nck was recovered in EphB1 complexes following ligand activation. Based on the yeast two-hybrid data presented above, we proceeded to evaluate the role of EphB1-Tyr594 in the Nck interaction. Shown in Fig. 2 B, we expressed HA epitope-tagged versions of either wild type or mutant (Y594F or Y600F) EphB1 in Cos-1 cells. Ephrin B1/Fc stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of transiently expressed EphB1. Qualitatively similar EphB1 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in EphB1 wild type and mutants (Y594F and Y600F), consistent with our data showing that a number of cytoplasmic domain tyrosine residues undergo phosphorylation upon ligand activation (16Stein E. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23588-23593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Nck was recruited to wild type and the Y600F mutant EphB1 but not to Y594F mutant EphB1 receptors. In aggregate, these findings provide strong evidence that Nck recruitment requires phosphorylation of Tyr594. We anticipated that cytoskeletal rearrangements are a necessary feature for cell-cell aggregation and targeting functions subserved by Eph receptors. In addition, recent work showed that Nck binds a serine threonine kinase, NIK, that serves as an upstream regulator of the JNK signaling pathway (36Su Y.-C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we evaluated the potential for Nck to couple EphB1 with JNK activation. Shown in Fig.3 A, c-Jun kinase was activated when P19 cells were exposed to ephrin B1/Fc. Similar results were obtained in HRMEC (not shown). As with the recruitment of Nck (Fig. 2), dimeric or multimeric ephrinB1/Fc evoked similar JNK activation responses. These effects were seen at ephrin B1/Fc concentrations greater than 125 ng ml−1, and activation was not stimulated by human IgG1, which is used as a control for Fc domain effects (not shown). JNK activity increases of 2–3-fold were typically seen within 10 min and in some experiments increased to 5-fold by 120 min (Fig. 3 A, right panel). This timing pattern is consistent with that of Nck recruitment to ligand-activated EphB1. Nck is found in EphB1 complexes as early as 7 min and persists beyond 30 min.2 A similarly delayed JNK activation response has been observed in response to transforming growth factor-β, where persistent increases in activity are evident between 2 and 12 h (37Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To evaluate functional consequences of Nck recruitment upon EphB1-mediated responses, we used a dominant negative strategy to undermine the effects coupled to endogenous receptor activation. By expressing Nck binding-defective mutant EphB1 receptors at sufficiently high levels in P19 cells, we could evaluate changes in JNK activation and attachment to fibronectin-coated plates. Our transfection methods achieve high efficiency transfection of P19 cells (60–70%), and the pSRα expression plasmids drive exogenous EphB1 expression levels to 20–40-fold those of endogenous receptors. Using this approach, we assessed dominant effects of wild type, kinase defective mutant (K652R), or Nck binding mutant (Y594F) EphB1 upon downstream JNK activation and cell attachment. Shown in Fig. 3 B, ephrin B1 stimulated 2–2.5-fold increases in JNK activity in cells transfected with either vector control (pSRα) or wild type EphB1 (pSRα-EphB1/HA). In contrast, ephrin B1 failed to increase JNK activity in cells transfected with either kinase defective (K652R) or Nck binding defective (Y594F) mutant receptors. In multiple experiments, we consistently observed a lower activation of JNK in transfected (2–2.5-fold), compared with nontransfected cells (3–5-fold). This appears to reflect differences in basal JNK activation, depending upon the transfection protocol. Correlating with the JNK activation results, identically treated transfected P19 cells showed marked increases in attachment to fibronectin-coated dishes when transfected with either vector alone or wild type EphB1 expression plasmid (Fig. 3 B). Yet, high level expression of kinase defective (K652R) or Nck binding defective mutant (Y594F) EphB1 receptors eliminated ephrin B1-promoted attachment. In aggregate, our findings support a role for Nck in JNK activation and attachment responses downstream of EphB1 activation Nck is an EphB1-interactive protein that is recruited to EphB1 signaling complexes, apparently through binding of its SH2 domain with EphB1 residue Tyr594. This interaction is stimulated by ligand activation in P19 cells and HRMEC expressing native receptors. EphB1 receptor activation stimulates JNK, an effect requiring the recruitment of Nck to EphB1. Mutation of the site at which Nck binds EphB1 attenuates downstream JNK activation and EphB1-coupled attachment responses. Identification of Tyr594 as the site of interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system was somewhat surprising. Based on its affinity for small phosphopeptides, a consensus recognition binding site for the Nck SH2 domain, pYDEP, was determined (31Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). This consensus is different from the residues adjacent to Tyr594 (YIDP) and Tyr600 (YEDP) in the EphB1 sequence. Both of these motifs are shared between EphB1 and EphB2 (15Ellis C. Kasmi F. Ganju P. Walls E. Panayotou G. Reith A.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1727-1736PubMed Google Scholar). We have confirmed the role of Tyr594 in Nck binding in both yeast and mammalian cell systems through experiments that included independent review of the sequences of each construct shown in Fig. 2 B. A previous report identified a platelet-derived growth factor β receptor peptide sequence, pYVPL, as a Nck binding site (38Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Li W. Mondino A. Zhou M. Cooper J. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6889-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting that some flexibility exists in the binding requirements. It is noteworthy that the sequence, 594pY(I/V)DP, is conserved at this position in all the Eph family receptors (15Ellis C. Kasmi F. Ganju P. Walls E. Panayotou G. Reith A.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1727-1736PubMed Google Scholar). The previous finding that Nck does not bind EphA4 (15Ellis C. Kasmi F. Ganju P. Walls E. Panayotou G. Reith A.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1727-1736PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that factors other than primary amino acid sequence are likely determinants of the site of tyrosine phosphorylation in this subdomain. A recent report by Holland et al. provided evidence for an indirect role of Nck in signaling downstream of activated EphB2 (39Holland S.J. Gale N.W. Gish G.D. Roth R.A. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Yancopoulos G.D. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3877-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). They found that EphB2 activation caused tyrosine phosphorylation of a 62–64-kDa protein (p62dok) (40Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B. Cell. 1997; 88: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 41Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), which in turn formed a complex with the Ras GTPase activation protein (RasGAP) and Nck. We have re-evaluated our EphB1 immunoprecipitates following ligand activation and were unable to demonstrate co-precipitation of either p62-dok or RAS-GAP with EphB1 recovered from P19 (data not shown). Despite the structural similarities of the EphB subclass receptor cytoplasmic domains, it appears that remarkable differences may be observed in the signaling pathways utilized by specific EphB receptors. The identification of Nck as an EphB1-interactive protein is particularly intriguing in light of the roles EphB subclass receptors play in neuronal guidance, targeting, and cell-cell aggregation (4Bohme B. VandenBos T. Cerretti D.P. Park L.S. Holtrich U. Ruebsamen-Waigmann H. Strebhardt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24747-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Wang H.U. Anderson D.J.

Cell. 1996; 86: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The Nck-related Drosophila protein, DOCK, mediates signals that direct axonal guidance in the Drosophila eye, where DOCK mutations cause abnormal fasciculation of retinal axons, with failure to follow guidance cues to their correct targets (32Garrity P. Rao Y. Salecker I. McGlade J. Pawson T. Zipursky S.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Our findings show that DOCK displays functional similarities to Nck in its capacity to bind ligand-activated EphB1 and suggest that an upstream EphB receptor participates in the retinal axon targeting that is aberrant in the DOCK mutants. In other studies, Nck has been shown to interact with a number of crucial determinants of cytoskeletal function and signaling. Yeast two-hybrid screens have identified Nck interactions with the Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP, a putative effector of CDC42) (43Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Marcilla A. Sameshima J.H. Robbins K.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5725-5731Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and a serine/threonine protein kinase PRK2, similar to the Rho effector, PKN) (44Quilliam L.A. Lambert Q.T. Mickelson-Young L.A. Westwick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Channing J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28772-28776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Nck associates with focal adhesion kinase upon stimulation of mesangial cells with thrombin, correlating with thrombin-stimulated focal adhesion kinase activation (45Choudhury G.G. Marra F. Abbound H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F295-F300PubMed Google Scholar). Two independent observations may place Nck in responses mediated through Rac, the G-protein implicated in formation of lamellipodia required for migration (36Su Y.-C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 46Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Nck SH3 domains bind with high affinity to mPak3, a Ste20 family serine/threonine kinase that binds Cdc42 and Rac1, but not RhoA, in their activated (GTPγS bound) states (46Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, Nck also interacts with the Ste20 family serine/threonine kinase, NIK, a protein coupled to activation of MKK4 and JNK (36Su Y.-C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Other intermediary kinases may participate in JNK activation. For example, transforming growth factor-β stimulates delayed JNK activation through TAK1, a kinase capable of phosphorylating MKK4, a mediator of JNK activation (47Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Tangiguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that Nck recruitment to EphB1, with the subsequent activation of JNK, appears necessary to link Eph receptor activation with cellular cytoskeletal modifications important in attachment. However, other recent results from our lab have shown an important role for ephrin B1 clustering in promoting P19 cell attachment.2As was shown here, Nck recruitment to EphB1 complexes does not require presentation of ephrin B1 as a preclustered multimer. Thus, Nck recruitment appears necessary but not sufficient for the functional coupling of EphB1 activation to this cell attachment response. We anticipate that Nck is one of several proteins that must function in this regard. We offer special thanks to Stan Hollenberg (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute, Seattle, WA) for the two-hybrid vectors and murine cDNA library, to James Clemens (Department of Biochemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) for the DOCK construct, to John Kyriakis (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA) for the GST-c-Jun expression plasmid, and to Tony Pawson (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario) for helpful critical input."

From recent works on rRNA maturation, it appears that most (if not all) of the Ψ in eukaryotic rRNA is probably synthesized by a single (or at least very few) rRNA:Ψ synthase(s); in this latter case the enzyme(s) is(are) guided to the different target uridines within the rRNA by a huge family of diverse small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins present in the nucleolus (10Ni J. Tien A.L. Fournier M.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 565-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 11Ganot P. Bortolin M.L. Kiss T.

Cell. 1997; 89: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The first RNA:pseudouridine synthase that was purified and fully characterized came from Salmonella typhimurium (13Arena F. Ciliberto G. Ciampi S. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4523-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and later from Escherichia coli (14Kammen H.O. Marvel C.C. Hardy L. Penhoet E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2255-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It corresponds to a tRNA:Ψ synthase (PSU-I, previously called hisT gene product, recently renamed to truA). It catalyzes the formation of Ψ38, Ψ39, and/or Ψ40 in several cellular tRNAs. Only the gene for theE. coli enzyme (PSU-I) was cloned and sequenced (15Arps P.J. Marvel C.C. Rubin B.C. Tolan D.A. Penhoet E.E. Winkler M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5297-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). TheE. coli PSU-Ip is a monomer with a molecular mass of 31 kDa (270 amino acids), whereas PSU-Ip from S. typhimurium has a subunit size of about 50 kDa and dimerizes in the presence of tRNA substrate (13Arena F. Ciliberto G. Ciampi S. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4523-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A higher eukaryotic homolog of PSU-I from calf thymus was highly enriched after five chromatographic steps (16Green C.J. Kammen H.O. Penhoet E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3045-3052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, a homogeneous preparation was not obtained. All of these enzymes have similar properties: they do not require any cofactor, they catalyze the Ψ formation at contiguous sites (region specificity), and they demonstrate similar kinetic properties (13Arena F. Ciliberto G. Ciampi S. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4523-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Kammen H.O. Marvel C.C. Hardy L. Penhoet E.E. J. Biol.

Recently three other E. coli RNA:Ψ synthases were identified and their corresponding genes cloned: truB, which is site-specific for Ψ at position 55 in tRNA (17Nurse K. Wrzesinski J. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA. 1995; 1: 102-112PubMed Google Scholar); rluA, specific for Ψ at position 32 in tRNA and at position 746 in 23 S rRNA (dual specificity; Ref. 18Wrzesinski J. Nurse K. Bakin A. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. RNA. 1995; 1: 437-448PubMed Google Scholar); and rsuA, specific for U at position 516 in 16 S rRNA associated with ribosomal proteins within a ribosomal ribonucleoprotein complex (19Wrzesinski J. Bakin A. Nurse K. Lane B.G. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8904-8913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The genes for two other tRNA:pseudouridine synthases (Pus1p and Pus2p) from yeast were also identified, one of them (PUS1) was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli (9Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The recombinant yeast Pus1p was shown to be specific for Ψ at position 27 in several yeast tRNAs and for Ψ at positions 34 and 36 in the intron-containing pre-tRNAIle (9; for review, see Ref. 20Grosjean H. Szweykowska-Kulinska Z. Motorin Y. Fasiolo F. Simos G. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This enzyme has a molecular mass of 62 kDa and was shown to be located essentially in the yeast nucleus (9Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The target RNA and position(s) of uridine to be modified by Pus2p (a 42-kDa protein) have not been determined yet. Another yeast protein has been reported to be homologous to E. coli and S. typhimurium pseudouridine synthases PSU-I (hisT gene product, truAp) (21Carbone M.L. Solinas M. Sora S. Panzeri L. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This protein (called Deg1 because disruption of the gene causes depressed growth; SacchDB accession number YFL001W, SwissProt P31115) also displays a significant homology to the yeast Pus1p (9Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Based on this sequence homology with PSU-I, it was suggested (21Carbone M.L. Solinas M. Sora S. Panzeri L. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that Deg1 protein may possess the corresponding activity of hisT gene product, but this plausible hypothesis was never tested experimentally. Here we present experimental evidence that yeast protein Deg1 is indeed a new distinct yeast tRNA:Ψ synthase (Pus3p) with a slightly different specificity toward tRNA compared with E. coli enzyme truA since it catalyzes the formation of only Ψ38 and Ψ39(not Ψ40). The structural substrate requirements and the intracellular localization of Pus3p are also analyzed. α-32P-Radiolabeled nucleotide triphosphates (400 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham (U. K.). Tris, dithioerythritol, dithiothreitol, nucleoside triphosphates,Penicillium citricum nuclease P1, Aspergillus oryzae RNase T2, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate and CMCT were from Aldrich. Bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, restriction enzymes, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were from from MBI Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania). RNasin and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase were from Promega. Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides used as primers for reverse transcription were purchased from MWG-Biotech (Germany) and used without further purification. Thin layer cellulose plates were from Schleicher & Schuell (Germany), and all other chemicals were from Merck Biochemicals (Germany). The plasmids carrying the synthetic genes of tRNAs used in this work were described previously tRNAAsp (GUC) (22Perret V. Garcia A. Puglisi J. Grosjean H. Ebel J.-P. Florentz C. Giegé R. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), pre-tRNAIle(UAU) and its mutant (anticodon UUA) (23Szweykowska-Kulinska Z. Senger B. Keith G. Fasiolo F. Grosjean H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4636-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), pre-tRNATyr(mutant UUA) (24Swerdlow H. Guthrie C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5197-5207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and E. coli tRNASer (GGA) (25Motorin Y.A. Bec G. Tewari R. Grosjean H. RNA. 1997; 3: 721-733PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids with cloned genes of yeast tRNAPhe (GAA) and its mutants PheY54 (p67YF1, mutation C56G) and PheY55 (p67YF2, mutations G19C and C56G) have been described (26Sampson J. DiRenzo A.B. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2523-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying yeast tRNAHis (GUG), yeast tRNASer (IGA), and mutant yeast tRNAVal (harboring anticodon CAU instead of UAC) were gifts, respectively, of Dr. J. Rudinger (IBMC, Strasbourg), Dr. H. Himeno (Tokyo University, Japan), and Dr. F. Fasiolo (IBMC). The synthetic gene for yeast tRNAAla (anticodon IGC) was constructed by ligation of sets of complementary oligonucleotides as described (22Perret V. Garcia A. Puglisi J. Grosjean H. Ebel J.-P. Florentz C. Giegé R. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The DNA template for T7 transcription of E. colitRNALeu (CAG) and yeast intronless tRNATrp(bearing a mutated anticodon CUA) were prepared by PCR amplification of the corresponding sequence present in E. coli genomic DNA and in plasmid (pT7T3am2ΔIVS, provided by Dr. J. B. Bell, University of Alberta, Canada) using two complementary oligonucleotides to each gene sequence, one bearing a T7 promoter sequence and the other one half of an MvaI restriction site. The minisubstrate composed of the anticodon stem-loop of tRNAPhe (with and without intron) was prepared by T7 transcription using synthetic double-stranded DNA template as described (27Jiang H.-Q. Motorin Y.A. Jin Y.-X. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2694-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In vitro T7 RNA-polymerase transcription using α-32P-radiolabeled nucleotide triphosphates and purification of the resulting T7 runoff tRNA transcripts by urea gels were performed as described (27Jiang H.-Q. Motorin Y.A. Jin Y.-X. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2694-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Auxilien S. Crain P.F. Trewyn R.W. Grosjean H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 437-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The wild type yeast strain used in this study was RS453 (α/a, ade2/ade2, leu2/leu2, ura3/ura3, his3/his3, trp1/trp1), and all mutant strains containing disrupted genes were derived from this one. Yeast cells were grown on minimal SDC and rich YPD medium (37Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B.N. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), and sporulation of diploid cells on YPA plates and tetrad analysis were performed according to Ref. 29Wimmer C. Doye V. Grandi P. Nehrbass U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar. Minimal SDC medium/plates were supplemented by all amino acids and nutrients except the ones used for the selection or, if indicated, contained 5-fluoroorotic acid (CSM medium, BIO 101, La Jolla). Genetic manipulations were performed as described (30Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 194: 3-20Crossref Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Preparation of the construct for expression of Deg1 in yeast was done as follows. The DEG1 gene was amplified by PCR from total yeast genomic DNA using two primers that created anXbaI restriction site in the 5′-untranslated region of the gene 151 nucleotides upstream of the start codon (ttttttctagAATCAATGGGCTCAGCTC, complementary sequence in capital letters) and an SalI restriction site (tttttgtcgacAAGAAATATAGTCTTCAAGG) in the 3′-untranslated region of the gene 50 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon. This allowed cloning of the gene into a pRS315 vector previously cut withXbaI/SalI. This construct could complement the slow growing phenotype when transformed in thedeg1 − haploid cells. The construct for expression of His6-tagged recombinant Deg1 in E. coli was prepared by the following procedure. TheDEG1 ORF was amplified by PCR from total yeast genomic DNA using two primers that created an XhoI restriction site at the ATG start codon (aaaaactcgagcAGTAATTTCATTAGAAGGCTAG) and anMluI restriction site (aaaaaacgcgtAAGAAATATAGTCTTCAAGG) in the 3′-untranslated region of the gene. This manipulation allowed cloning of the ORF into a modified pET (pET-His6/pET8c) vector previously cut with XhoI/MluI and created an in-frame fusion protein of 6 histidine residues joined by a spacer Ser-Ser dipeptide to the amino acid immediately after the start methionine. The vector containing the fusion gene was transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Disruption of the DEG1gene was done by the one-step gene replacement method (31Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). In this study, the DEG1 gene was disrupted by inserting aBamHI fragment 0.9 kilobases long and containing theHIS3 gene into the BamHI site of theDEG1-ORF cloned in the pET8c vector. The disrupted gene was excised and the linear fragments used to transform the diploid strain RS453. HIS + transformants with the correct integration of the interrupted gene at the DEG1 locus were verified by PCR analysis (data not shown). Correct integrants were sporulated, and tetrads were dissected. A 4:0 segregation for viability and a 2:2 segregation for the HIS marker were found for theDEG1 gene disruption showing that this gene is not essential for cell growth. However, all spores carrying a disruptedDEG1 gene grew slower giving rise to small colonies as reported previously (21Carbone M.L. Solinas M. Sora S. Panzeri L. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To construct a haploid yeast strain in which the disrupted PUS1 andDEG1 genes are combined, a PUS1 −mutant harboring pURA3-PUS1 was mated to the mutantDEG1 −. The resulting heterozygous diploids were sporulated, and tetrad analysis was performed. For complete tetrads in which the HIS +/his −genotype segregates 2:2, one can predict that the two HIS+progeny aredeg1::HIS3/pus1::HIS3. A complete tetrad showing this segregation pattern was analyzed in greater detail for the segregation of the HIS3 andURA3 markers by plating cells on SDC-his and SDC-ura plates, respectively. The HIS+ progenydeg1::HIS3/pus1:HIS3also contained the plasmid pURA3-PUS1; we could shuffle out this plasmid and test whether the double mutantpus1 −/deg1 − gives synthetic lethality by plating this strain on 5-fluoroorotic acid containing plates at 30 °C. The los1−/deg1 − strain was constructed in a similar way. Epitope tagging of Deg1p was done by fusing two IgG binding units from Staphyloccus aureus protein A to the N-terminal end of Deg1p. For this gene fusion, a new PstI restriction site was generated at the ATG codon of DEG1 by PCR-mediated mutagenesis, and the ORF was subcloned into the plasmid pRS315 in-frame with the two IgG binding units under the control of the NOP1 promoter (PNop1-ProtA cassette; see Ref. 32Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), creating the plasmid pNOP-ProtA-Deg1. Affinity purification of the ProtA fusion protein was done as described previously (32Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Tagging with GFP was done in a similar way, but the IgG binding units were replaced by the ORF for GFP (PNop1-GFP cassette), 2K. Hellmuth and E. C. Hurt, unpublished data. creating the plasmid pNOP-GFP-Deg1. The GFP used is a S65T/V163A variant exhibiting enhanced fluorescence properties (33Kahana J. Silver P. Curr. Protocols Mol. Biol. 1996; 9: 722-728Google Scholar, 34Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. McKeon F. Nature. 1996; 382: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Intracellular localization of the ProtA-Deg1p fusion protein was performed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy as described in Ref. 9Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar using as first antibody rabbit anti-protein A (Sigma) and as second antibody CyTM3-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova). GFP-Deg1p was observed in living cells by direct fluorescent microscopy. Preparation of S100 extract from yeast as well as from E. coli was made as described elsewhere (25Motorin Y.A. Bec G. Tewari R. Grosjean H. RNA. 1997; 3: 721-733PubMed Google Scholar, 28Auxilien S. Crain P.F. Trewyn R.W. Grosjean H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 437-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The activity of yeast extracts and purified yeast enzyme fractions was tested at 30 °C; 37 °C was used for testing E. coli extracts. The incubation mixture contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mmammonium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1–2 fmol of32P-radiolabeled T7 runoff transcripts as substrate. After incubation, the pseudouridine content in the radiolabeled transcripts was analyzed as described previously (27Jiang H.-Q. Motorin Y.A. Jin Y.-X. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2694-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Auxilien S. Crain P.F. Trewyn R.W. Grosjean H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 437-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, the RNA was first extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated in ethanol, and then hydrolyzed completely to 3′-nucleotide monophosphates by RNase T2. Each hydrolysate was chromatographed on two-dimensional thin layer chromatography plates, and the radioactivity in the ΨMP and UMP spots was evaluated after exposing the thin layer chromatography plates with a PhosphorImager screen. Taking into account the relative number of ΨMP and UMP in the tRNA molecule, the relative amount of Ψ over tRNA molecule (expressed in mol/mol of tRNA) can be evaluated. The accuracy of this method was found to be about ± 0.05 mol of Ψ/mol of tRNA. Localization of pseudouridine residues in tRNA was performed as described (35Bakin A. Ofengand J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9754-9762Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 36Bakin A. Ofengand J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3290-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 10 μg of total tRNA extracted from wild type or mutant yeast strain was treated by 0.17 m CMCT in Bicine-urea buffer, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 42 °C. Reverse transcription was done at 42 °C for 45 min using about 1 μg of CMCT-modified cytoplasmic tRNA or 3 μg of CMCT-modified mitochondrial tRNA and 1–2 pmol of 5′-32P-labeled synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide primer. Reverse transcription products were separated on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The oligodeoxynucleotide primers were chosen to be complementary to the 18 nucleotides at the 3′-end of cytoplasmic tRNAGly and mitochondrial tRNAArg, respectively, because both of these tRNAs have a low content of modified nucleotides downstream from the pseudouridylation sites. Isolation of total yeast DNA was done essentially as described in Ref. 37Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B.N. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar. DNA and plasmid manipulations (restriction analysis, end filling reactions, ligations, PCR amplifications, DNA fragment recovery, and small scale and large scale plasmid preparations) were done essentially according to standard procedures (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of tRNA inserts in the various plasmids used was verified systematically by the dideoxy sequencing technique. Evaluation of the protein concentration was done according to Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar), and Western blotting was performed as described in Ref. 9Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar. Screening of the nonredundant GenBank data base was performed using BLAST algorithm, version 1.4.9; amino acid substitution matrix BLOSUM62 was used in all data base searches. Multiple sequence alignment was constructed using Macintosh version of MACAW software, version 2.0.5. The accessibility of whole genome sequencing data for several prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms allows the systematic screening for the corresponding enzymes based on sequence homology. BLAST search, using thehisT(truA) gene of E. coli (coding for tRNA:Ψ38–40 synthase; see Ref. 15Arps P.J. Marvel C.C. Rubin B.C. Tolan D.A. Penhoet E.E. Winkler M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5297-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as a query sequence, allows detection of several homologous proteins in the GenBank. Partial sequence alignment of hisT(truA)-like proteins of different origin is presented on Fig. 1. These are mostly putative pseudouridine synthases I (PSU-I) from several bacteria and lower eukaryotes. Higher eukaryotes are presented by the partial nucleotide sequence of human (zn81c07.s1) Deg1-like protein. All of these putative proteins display significant sequence homology with E. coli truA (BLAST p value is less than 0.001). All proteins share common signature blocks of amino acid, which suggests the same or similar function in the cellular metabolism. Here it is noteworthy to remember that the yeast PUS1 gene also shares high homology with the truA(hisT) gene, but the corresponding RNA:Ψ synthase has a different specificity and properties (9Simos G. Tekotte H. Grosjean H. Segref A. Sharma K. Tollervey D. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2270-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Also, as already noted by Koonin (40Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2411-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), this group of hisT(truA)-like enzymes is rather distant from the pseudouridine synthases identified so far, specific, respectively, for Ψ55 (E. coli truB-like), for Ψ32 in tRNA and Ψ746 in 23 S rRNA (E. coli rluA-like), and for Ψ516 in E. coli 18 S rRNA. From the above sequence homology one can expect that protein Deg1 has enzymatic activity similar to that of E. coli truA. To test the function of yeast Deg1 protein, we performed one-step gene disruption of the corresponding gene in yeast. The resulting yeast strain remains viable, but the deg1−mutant grows slower compared with parent wild type strain cells as was reported previously (21Carbone M.L. Solinas M. Sora S. Panzeri L. Curr. Genet. 1991; 19: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we observed that the slow growth phenotype is particularly strong at 37 °C (Fig.2). This thermosensitive phenotype and growth defect of the deg1− strain could be fully complemented by expressing the cloned DEG1 gene or the fusion proteins ProtA-Deg1p and GFP-Deg1 (Fig. 2 and below). The cell-free extracts (S100) obtained from DEG1-disrupted and from the wild type yeast strains (used as a control) were tested for pseudouridine synthase activity using several synthetic tRNA transcripts as substrates. Taking advantage of 11 different yeast tRNA transcripts labeled internally by appropriate α-32P-NTPs (see “Experimental Procedures”), 10 potential pseudouridylation sites in tRNA molecules were tested (TableI).Table IPseudouridine formation in various tRNA transcripts incubated with extracts of wild type and DEG1-disrupted yeast strainPosition of ΨtRNA transcriptLabelingmol Ψ/mol tRNAWild typeDEG1−Ψ13Yeast tRNAAspATP0.300.30Ψ26 + Ψ27Yeast tRNATrp mutant (CUA)UTP1.201.30Ψ28 +Ψ39 + Ψ55Yeast tRNATrpmutant (CUA)CTP2.151.55Ψ32Yeast tRNASerUTP0.400.20Yeast tRNAVal mutant (CAU)UTP0.200.15Yeast tRNAHisUTP0.850.85Ψ34+ Ψ36Yeast pre-tRNAIleATP1.751.80Ψ35Yeast pre-tRNAIle mutant (UUA)ATP0.650.75Yeast pre-tRNATyr mutant (UUA)ATP0.250.20Ψ38Yeast tRNAAlaGTP0.50<0.05Ψ39Yeast tRNAHisGTP0.70<0.05Mut yeast tRNAPhe(PheY55)CTP0.85<0.05Ψ39 + Ψ55Yeast tRNAPheCTP1.701.00Ψ55Yeast tRNAAspCTP0.800.95 Open table in a new tab The results indicate that activities for the formation of Ψ13, Ψ27, Ψ28, Ψ32, Ψ34, Ψ35, Ψ36, and Ψ55 are present in both the wild type and the mutant yeast extracts. Only the pseudouridine synthase activity toward of U38 and U39 was lacking in the extract of the DEG1-disrupted strain, whereas the same uridine residues were modified quantitatively to pseudouridines when the extract of the wild type strain was used (Table I and Fig.3). From these results, one can conclude that the disruption of the DEG1 gene interferes with the enzymatic formation of both Ψ38 and Ψ39 in anticodon branch of tRNAs. To show that Deg1p is solely responsible for the modifications missing in the DEG1-disrupted strain, the recombinant protein was expres"
https://openalex.org/W2090178694,"The Ca2+-dependent lipid binding domain of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is a homolog of C2 domains present in protein kinase C, synaptotagmin, and numerous other proteins involved in signal transduction. NH2-terminal fragments of cPLA2 spanning the C2 domain were expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, extracted with solvent to remove phospholipids, and refolded to yield a domain capable of binding phospholipid vesicles in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Unlike other C2 domains characterized to date, the cPLA2 C2 domain bound preferentially to vesicles comprised of phosphatidylcholine in response to physiological concentrations of Ca2+. Binding of the cPLA2 C2 domain to vesicles in the presence of excess Ca2+ chelator was induced by high concentrations of salts that promote hydrophobic interactions. Despite the selective hydrolysis of arachidonyl-containing phospholipid vesicles by cPLA2, the cPLA2 C2 domain did not discriminate among phospholipid vesicles containing saturated or unsaturated sn-2 fatty acyl chains. Moreover, the cPLA2 C2 domain bound to phospholipid vesicles containing sn-1 and -2 ether linkages and sphingomyelin at Ca2+ concentrations that caused binding to vesicles containing ester linkages, demonstrating that the carbonyl oxygens of the sn-1 and-2 ester linkage are not critical for binding. These results suggest that the cPLA2C2 domain interacts primarily with the headgroup of the phospholipid. The cPLA2 C2 domain displayed selectivity among group IIA cations, preferring Ca2+ approximately 50-fold over Sr2+ and nearly 10,000-fold over Ba2+ for vesicle binding. No binding to vesicles was observed in the presence of greater than 10 mm Mg2+. Such strong selectivity for Ca2+ over Mg2+ reinforces the view that C2 domains link second messenger Ca2+ to signal transduction events at the membrane.

Binding of the cPLA2 C2 domain to vesicles in the presence of excess Ca2+ chelator was induced by high concentrations of salts that promote hydrophobic interactions. Despite the selective hydrolysis of arachidonyl-containing phospholipid vesicles by cPLA2, the cPLA2 C2 domain did not discriminate among phospholipid vesicles containing saturated or unsaturated sn-2 fatty acyl chains. Moreover, the cPLA2 C2 domain bound to phospholipid vesicles containing sn-1 and -2 ether linkages and sphingomyelin at Ca2+ concentrations that caused binding to vesicles containing ester linkages, demonstrating that the carbonyl oxygens of the sn-1 and-2 ester linkage are not critical for binding. These results suggest that the cPLA2C2 domain interacts primarily with the headgroup of the phospholipid. The cPLA2 C2 domain displayed selectivity among group IIA cations, preferring Ca2+ approximately 50-fold over Sr2+ and nearly 10,000-fold over Ba2+ for vesicle binding. No binding to vesicles was observed in the presence of greater than 10 mm Mg2+. Such strong selectivity for Ca2+ over Mg2+ reinforces the view that C2 domains link second messenger Ca2+ to signal transduction events at the membrane.

In cells, the increase in Ca2+ results in the selective translocation of cPLA2 to the membranes of the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum (9Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We have shown previously that the domain responsible for the membrane association is encoded at the NH2 terminus of cPLA2 (6Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y.

This Ca2+-dependent lipid binding domain is homologous to the regulatory C2 domain originally described in the classical isoforms of protein kinase C (12Coussens L. Parker P.J. Rhee L. Yang-Feng T.L. Chen E. Waterfield M.D. Franke U. Ullrich A. Science. 1986; 233: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) but now recognized to be present in numerous proteins, and it may serve as a paradigm to explain both the features common to these domains as well as those that provide specificity among the domains. Homologs of the protein kinase C C2 domain have been identified in at least four classes of eukaryotic proteins that carry out critical functions at cellular membranes (1Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.-L. J. Lipid Mediators Cell Signalling. 1995; 12: 83-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 6Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N.

These proteins include lipid-modifying enzymes (e.g. cPLA2, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC), yeast phosphatidylserine decarboxylase-2, several isoforms of the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and a plant phospholipase D), protein kinases (e.g. α, β, γ, δ, ε, η, and θ isoforms of protein kinase C and certain related protein kinase C), GTPase-activating proteins (ras-GTPase-activating protein and its relatives), and regulators of vesicle transport (e.g. synaptotagmin, rabphilin, DOC2, UNC-13, and perforin). Although the functions of the proteins that contain C2 domains are in many cases well defined, the roles that C2 domains play in these proteins are poorly understood. The generalized function of the C2 domain appears to be membrane association; the ligands for C2 domains identified to date comprise various components of cellular membranes, including phospholipids, inositol polyphosphates, and other membrane-associated proteins (for review in detail, see Ref. 15Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Interactions between C2 domains and these ligands are predicted to regulate the various protein-specific biochemical activities. For example, the C2 domain of PLC-δ1 has been proposed to orient or “fix” the catalytic domain of the enzyme to the membranes after it has been “tethered” by the binding of the pleckstrin homology domain to phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (16Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). To study the ligand specificity of the cPLA2 C2 domain without the effects of lipid binding to the catalytic domain of cPLA2, we have expressed the cPLA2 C2 domain initially as a fusion protein and subsequently as a polypeptide refolded from inclusion bodies free of lipid contamination. This domain binds zwitterionic phospholipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine preferentially over anionic vesicles in the presence of physiological levels of Ca2+. This domain is highly selective for Ca2+ over Sr2+, Ba2+, and Mg2+ with respect to vesicle binding. In addition, this domain binds to phospholipid vesicles lackingsn-1 or -2 carbonyl oxygens and is insensitive to changes in the length and degree of saturation of the sn-2 fatty acyl chain, suggesting that the specific interactions with the ligand are limited to the headgroup of the phospholipid. Based on these results, we compare the properties of the cPLA2 C2 domain with other C2 domains and other proteins that bind phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Constructions were carried out using conventional protocols (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) to generate DNA encoding proteins that could be expressed in mammalian COS or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or in Escherichia coli either as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST) or as independent polypeptides in inclusion bodies. DNA fragments encoding cPLA2 residues 1–126, 1–138, 1–155, and 1–178 were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using full-length human cPLA2 cDNA as a template and antisense primers incorporating a 3′-stop codon and EcoRI/SalI restriction sites. For construction of GST fusion proteins, 5′-PCR sense primers incorporated a BglII restriction site, codons for Gly and Ser residues as part of a thrombin cleavage site, and the first seven codons of cPLA2. cPLA2 PCR fragments generated from these PCRs were subcloned into theBamHI/EcoRI polylinker site of the vector pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) 3′ of the GST gene. Consequently, cPLA2 polypeptides liberated from GST fusion proteins by cleavage with thrombin contain additional NH2-terminal Gly-Ser residues. For construction of cPLA2 polypeptides produced in inclusion bodies, cPLA2 cDNA that had been modified previously by substitution of several 5′-codons with codons preferentially utilized in bacteria served as template DNA for the PCR; 5′-PCR primers incorporated these silent changes and anAflIII restriction site; 3′-PCR primers were the same as those used in GST fusion protein constructions. These PCR products were subcloned into the NcoI/EcoRI sites of the vector pTrcHisB (Invitrogen), removing the 5′-codons encoding the NH2 terminus of the polyHis fusion protein. Consequently, the pTrc constructs reported here utilize the trc promoter and initiator ATG codon normally employed by His fusion proteins, yet they encode cPLA2 residues exclusively when expressed inE. coli. DNA was transformed into the bacterial strain HB101. All DNA constructs were sequenced and shown to be correct. Details of constructions may be obtained from the authors. Bacteria expressing the appropriate constructs were fermented to late log phase and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C for GST constructs and 37 °C for inclusion body proteins. For isolation of GST fusion proteins, bacterial cell pellets were lysed by nitrogen cavitation. Supernatant was adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia), and fusion proteins were removed from beads by cleavage with thrombin (Sigma). Protein was passed over a Mono Q column (Pharmacia) and eluted with approximately 100 mm salt. Protein was dialyzed, concentrated, and stored in buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 0.1 mmEDTA) at 4 °C. Protein was greater than 90% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For protein expressed in inclusion bodies, bacterial cell pellets were lysed by microfluidization. Inclusion bodies were harvested, washed, and extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1) to remove lipids. Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6m guanidine HCl (GndHCl), passed over a TSK3000 gel filtration column (Toso-Haas) run in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature. The appropriate peak was passed over a Mono Q column at room temperature and eluted with 400–500 mm NaCl. Protein was refolded by diluting the desired Mono Q peak into a solution of 0.5 m arginine HCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 5 mm dithiothreitol while stirring slowly at 4 °C. Refolded protein was diluted slowly 2-fold into buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 5 mm dithiothreitol) and again 2-fold into a solution of 2m (NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA. Refolded protein was adsorbed to a Toyo-phenyl 650S column (Toso-Haas) equilibrated with buffer containing 1m (NH4)2SO4 and eluted in a single step with salt-free buffer. Eluted protein was concentrated by vacuum dialysis and passed over a Mono Q column. Correctly folded protein eluted with approximately 100 mm NaCl, whereas incorrectly folded protein, as judged by fluorescence spectroscopy (see below), eluted with 400–500 mm NaCl. Correctly folded protein was passed over a phenyl-5PW column (Toso-Haas) and eluted with a linear gradient of decreasing (NH4)2SO4. Correctly folded protein eluted with approximately 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, whereas incorrectly folded protein eluted during the final column wash in salt-free buffer. Protein was concentrated by vacuum dialysis and dialyzed against storage buffer. Protein purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% and 14% Tris-glycine and 10% Tricine gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent binding of recombinant proteins to natural membranes isolated from CHO cells was determined as described in detail previously (6Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S.

Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, at least 2 μg of test protein was mixed with CHO cell membranes in the presence of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and Ca2+/EGTA buffers to maintain the desired free Ca2+ concentration and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g, equal proportions of supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels. Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose, and test proteins appearing in supernatant and pellet fractions were detected by immunostaining with cPLA2 antisera and visualized by chemiluminescence. The binding of the cPLA2 C2 domain, which acts as the fluorescence donor, to small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles containing the fluorescent probe dansylphosphatidylethanolamine (dansyl-PE) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), the fluorescence acceptor, was measured as described previously (7Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modification. A total of 25–50 μg of test protein was diluted into a 2-ml solution containing 60 μg of test liposomes (composed of 5–10% dansyl-PE) in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EGTA in 3-ml quartz cuvettes. In experiments comparing different divalent cations, binding reactions were carried out in buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA. KCl was diluted from a Ca2+-free Ca2+ electrode-filling solution (Orion Research Incorporated, Boston). Reaction mixtures were stirred continuously, maintained at 20 °C, and illuminated with 284 nm wavelength light; emission of dansyl-PE was recorded at a wavelength of 520 nm. Levels of free divalent cations were raised by the addition of concentrated stocks of cations: for most experiments, a Ca2+ atomic absorption standard (VHG Laboratories, Manchester, NH) was used. Free Ca2+ levels were calculated using the Chelator program (19Schoenmakers T.J.M. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P.R. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-879PubMed Google Scholar) taking into account the pH of the binding reactions, measured separately. For experiments testing different divalent cations, the chloride salt of the metal ions (Fluka, puriss grade) was used; free cation levels were calculated according to Raaflaub (20Raaflaub J. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1960; 3: 301-325Crossref Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission of dansyl-PE in the presence of EGTA or EDTA (I 0) was subtracted from that in the presence of added metal ion (I) to determine energy transfer induced by the added metal ion, which was normalized to give (I −I 0)/I 0, expressed as a percentage. Vesicle compositions were varied according to the experiment. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PO-PC), -phosphoethanolamine (PO-PE), -phosphate (PO-PA), -phosphoserine (PO-PS) and -phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) (PO-PG),l-α-phosphatidylinositol (mixed acyl-PI), 1-palmitoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PP-PC), 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PA-PC), 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PL-PC), 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (assn-1 and -2 ether-linked phospholipid) and brain sphingomyelin were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). In experiments testing the effect of salt on vesicle binding, reactions were carried out in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 5 mm EGTA to chelate potential contaminating Ca2+. A solution containing vesicles and protein was reciprocally diluted by a like solution containing concentrated salts to increase the salt concentration and to keep the concentration of vesicles and protein constant. For each salt tested, a parallel series of experiments was carried out using stock solutions free of protein. Fluorescence emission of dansyl-PE in binding reactions free of protein (I 0) was subtracted from that containing protein (I) to determine energy transfer due to protein at each salt concentration, which was normalized to give (I −I 0)/I 0, expressed as a percentage. NaCl, (NH4)2SO4, and NH4Cl were greater than 99.5% pure (Fluka), and Na2SO4 was greater than 99% pure (Aldrich). All salts were specified by the manufacturer to contain less than 0.001% Ca2+. Binding of the C2 domain to synthetic vesicles was tested additionally as described above for natural membranes with modification. Synthetic phospholipid vesicles were prepared by brief sonication and collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. 10 μg of C2 domain was mixed with a 10 mm concentration of the resuspended phospholipid vesicles in the presence of 100 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), and 1 mm EDTA or 1 mm EDTA plus 1.1 mm CaCl2 (to maintain 100 μm free Ca2+) in 100 μl for 5 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, pellet fractions were washed once with reaction buffer and resuspended in buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Equal proportions of supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 15% gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and the amount of protein was quantified by scanning densitometry. Results were expressed as the ratio of the amount of protein present in the pellet fraction to the total amount in pellet and supernatant fractions. Total phosphate analysis of the resuspended vesicles verified that equivalent amounts of PO-PC, -PA, -PS, and -PG and mixed acyl-PI were present in the assay. The amounts of PO-PE which could be collected by centrifugation were very low; therefore, PO-PE was not used in the experiment. A total of 2 μg of the C2 domain, diluted into a 1-ml solution, with or without denaturant, containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 5 mm EDTA, was excited with 280 nm wavelength light in a 1.5-ml quartz cuvette at room temperature. Fluorescence emission wavelengths were scanned from 300 to 400 nm. Excitation and emission slit widths were both 5 nm. Similar emission maxima (but of lower intensity) were recorded when 294 nm wavelength excitation light was used. For renaturation experiments, a concentrated stock solution of protein prepared in a high concentration of denaturant was serially diluted into buffer without denaturant. The NH2-terminal 178 residues of cPLA2(cPLA2(1–178)) contain a C2 domain, a sequence motif that functions as a Ca2+-dependent lipid binding domain (6Clark J.D. Lin L.-L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S.

Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, cPLA2(1–178) was expressed as an independent polypeptide in COS cells and bound natural membranesin vitro at Ca2+ concentrations that activated enzymatic activity of cPLA2 (7Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these residues conferred upon a heterologous fusion protein the ability to bind to natural membranes and synthetic phospholipid vesicles in the presence of physiological levels of Ca2+ in vitro (7Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18239-18249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We sought to define better the minimal residues of the C2 domain. Based on the structure of the first C2 domain of synaptotagmin (21Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 22Shao X. Davletov B.A. Sutton R.B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Science. 1996; 273: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), the cPLA2 C2 domain was predicted to terminate prior to the exon boundary at Gln-126 (Fig.1). However, sequence alignment based on the report of a second C2 domain topological fold, that of PLC-δ1 (16Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), in which the β-strand that corresponds topologically to the first β-strand of synaptotagmin is located at the COOH terminus of the PLC-δ1 C2 domain, predicted that the cPLA2 C2 domain terminates at the next exon boundary Val-138 (15Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Thus, cPLA2 was COOH-terminally truncated at Gln-126 and Val-138, two exon boundaries, to ascertain whether they demarcated minimal functional boundaries. cPLA2 was also truncated in a polar stretch of the polypeptide at Lys-155 to test the importance of residues between 138 and 178. These polypeptides were expressed in COS or CHO cells as independently expressed polypeptides, or they were expressed in E. coli as fusion partners of GST or as inclusion body proteins that could be refolded. Recombinant fragments containing, at a minimum, residues 1–155, were expressed in both COS and CHO cells as soluble polypeptides that bound cellular membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner (data not shown). In contrast, both cPLA2(1–126) and (1–138) were expressed as insoluble polypeptides in COS cells. We turned to expression of recombinant protein in E. coli, reasoning that expression of cPLA2(1–126) and (1–138) in bacteria grown at lower temperatures in fusion to a highly soluble partner (GST) might overcome the solubility problems associated with protein overexpression in COS cells cultured at 37 °C. Indeed, recombinant fragments containing, at a minimum, residues 1–126 attached to the COOH terminus of GST were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in E. coli. However, GST-cPLA2(1–126) was considerably more insoluble than the other three fusion proteins; the little soluble cPLA2(1–126) that could be liberated from GST-cPLA2(1–126) bound in a Ca2+-independent manner to cellular membranes (data not shown). GST-cPLA2(1–138), (1–155), and (1–178) were fully functional, binding in a Ca2+-dependent manner in vitro to cellular membranes (data not shown). When liberated from GST-fusion proteins by thrombin cleavage and purified, cPLA2(1–138) and (1–155) reversibly bound to phosphatidylcholine vesicles (Fig. 2) and cellular membranes (data not shown) at low micromolar Ca2+levels. The additional Gly-Ser residues attached to the NH2terminus of cPLA2(1–138) and (1–155) to create a thrombin cleavage site (see “Experimental Procedures”) thus do not hamper binding to phospholipid vesicles. Although cPLA2(1–138) represented the minimal, fully functional C2 domain, we chose to characterize cPLA2(1–155) initially because of its higher yields. cPLA2(1–155) contains several aromatic residues, including a single tryptophan, Trp-71, which serves as a useful spectroscopic probe. Excitation of cPLA2(1–155) at 280 nm resulted in a strong fluorescence emission wavelength maximum at approximately 325 nm (Fig. 3 A), which is characteristic of tryptophan buried in a relatively nonpolar environment (23Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1986: 345-350Google Scholar). When diluted into high concentrations of urea or GndHCl, this fluorescence wavelength maximum red-shifted to approximately 348 nm, characteristic of tryptophan exposure to polar solvent.

The yeast Mac1 protein is a copper-sensing transcription factor that is essential for both the activation and inactivation of genes required for high affinity copper ion transport. Here we demonstrate that in response to low copper ion concentrations Mac1 protein is rendered inactive for copper transporter gene transcription. Under high copper ion concentrations Mac1 is degraded in a rapid, copper-specific manner. This degradation is critical to prevent copper toxicity that would otherwise result from sustained expression of the copper transport genes.

These results demonstrate that nutritional and toxic copper concentrations elicit distinct fates for the Mac1 copper-sensing transcription factor and establish a new mechanism by which trace metals regulate gene expression. Copper is an essential trace metal that serves as a critical co-factor for a number of enzymes, including cytochrome oxidase for respiration and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase for oxidative stress protection (1Linder M.C. Hazegh-Azam M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63: 797-811PubMed Google Scholar, 2Karlin K.D. Science. 1993; 261: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). When accumulated to excessive levels, copper is highly toxic due to its ability to engage in redox chemistry resulting in the generation of the destructive hydroxyl radical (3Halliwell B.

Therefore, a delicate balance must be established and maintained between the accumulation of sufficient copper ion levels for biochemical reactions and the elevation of copper ions to toxic levels. High affinity Cu(I) transport into yeast cells requires the action of the integral membrane Cu(I) transport proteins encoded by the CTR1 andCTR3 genes and the Fe(III)/Cu(II) reductase encoded by theFRE1 gene (4Hassett R.

In this work, we have investigated the mechanisms by which copper ions regulate expression of the yeast Cu(I) transport genes through Mac1p. We demonstrate that Mac1 is a stable protein in cells grown in low copper ion concentrations; however, Mac1 is degraded in a rapid, metal-specific fashion when cells are grown under high copper ion concentrations. Although Mac1 degradation is not obligatorily coupled to target gene regulation, the rapid turnover of Mac1 is essential to prevent copper ion toxicity as a consequence of sustained Cu(I) transporter gene expression. Copper ion activated degradation of the Mac1 transcription factor represents a new mechanism by which trace metals play important cellular regulatory roles. Yeast cells were grown under low copper ion conditions as described (8Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). All molecular biology manipulations were carried out as described (13$$Google Scholar). A coding region for a nine-amino acid epitope from the influenza hemagglutinin HA protein (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted in frame at the carboxyl terminus of the MAC1 or MAC1up1 open reading frame by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA of a wild type (DTY1) or MAC1up1 (DTY205) strain, respectively. The sequence of the gene was verified and the HA epitope-tagged allele, under the control of the MAC1 promoter, was subcloned viaHindIII (Klenow) and BamHI sites into theSalI (Klenow) and BamHI sites of the centromeric yeast plasmid pRS313 to generate pRSMac1(HA). The epitope-taggedMAC1 and MAC1 up1 alleles accurately reflected the function of the unadulterated MAC1 orMAC1 up1 alleles as ascertained by equivalent growth rates on YPE medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, and 3% ethanol) and copper-responsive regulation of the CTR3gene that was indistinguishable from the parental alleles, as assessed by RNase protection experiments when transformed into themac1Δ strain SLY2 (MATa a gal1 trp1-1 his3 ade8 ura3::Knr mac1::URA3). Plasmids pRSMac1-REP-I and pRSMac1-REP-II were constructed by site directed mutagenesis to generate the corresponding allele, followed by the exchange of a 544-base pair BspEI fragment encompassing the mutations in the MAC1 REP-I and REP-II alleles, with the same fragment from the wild type MAC1HA gene in plasmid pRSMac1(HA). All mutations and fusion junctions were verified by DNA sequencing. Point mutations in MAC1 were isolated based on the inability of cells to repress the expression of a fusion between the CTR3 promoter to the URA3 gene in the presence of 20 μmcopper. One category of uracil prototrophs mapped to theMAC1 gene and recombination mapping and sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of single amino acid substitutions in REP-I designated up3 and up4. The up3 andup4 alleles regulate CTR3 mRNA levels in response to copper ions in a manner indistinguishable from theup1 allele. 2S. Labbé and D. J. Thiele, unpublished data. To investigate the mechanisms by which Mac1p senses copper levels to control transcription of the high affinity Cu(I) transport genes, both Mac1 protein and mRNA levels were measured (12Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13$$Google Scholar). Mac1p-HA contains a single HA epitope at the Mac1p carboxyl terminus and completely functionally complements amac1 deletion strain. The analysis of Mac1p-HA from cells grown under low copper ion concentrations, and treated with increasing copper concentrations for up to 90 min, demonstrated that Mac1p-HA is stable at low copper concentrations. However, Mac1p-HA steady state levels are rapidly and nearly completely extinguished at or above 10 μm CuSO4 (Fig.1 A). The steady state levels of another yeast nuclear transcription factor, heat shock transcription factor (HSF; Ref. 14Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), remained constant at all copper ion concentrations over the course of these experiments (Fig.1 A). In contrast to Mac1p-HA protein levels, MAC1-HA mRNA levels were not responsive to copper ions and were constant for all samples (Fig. 1 B). To ascertain if the reduction in Mac1p-HA levels parallels the inactivation of high affinity Cu(I) transporter gene expression, RNA was prepared from aliquots of the same cell cultures, and CTR3 mRNA levels were measured by RNase protection assays. The data in Fig. 1 C show that, as observed previously, CTR3 mRNA levels were rapidly reduced in response to nanomolar copper ion concentrations. These data demonstrate that the loss of Mac1p-HA occurs at copper ion concentrations that exceed those required for normal inactivation ofCTR3 transcription. We observed the same copper ion-mediated extinction of Mac1p steady state levels in response to high copper ion concentrations by using a single or a double MYC epitope tag at the carboxyl terminus of Mac1 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that loss of Mac1p in response to high copper ion concentrations can be uncoupled from low copper ion-mediated Mac1-dependent extinction of Cu(I) transport gene transcription. The inactivation of yeast Cu(I) transporter gene transcription is highly specific for the metal ions copper and Ag(I), with responses to Cd(II) and Hg(II) only at metal concentrations 1000 times that of copper or Ag(I) (8Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To further test whether the dramatic reduction in Mac1p-HA levels observed with high copper ion concentrations is obligatorily coupled with Cu(I) transporter gene regulation, Mac1p-HA and CTR3 mRNA levels were measured from cells treated with 10 μm Ag(I) or Cd(II). The data in Fig. 2 A clearly demonstrate that while CTR3 expression was inactivated by Ag(I) and Cd(II) as observed previously (8Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), steady state levels of Mac1p-HA were not affected by either metal. Therefore, although Cu(I) transporter gene expression is inactivated by Cu and Ag(I) ions with equal efficacy, and by Cd(II) at much higher concentrations, the dramatic reduction of Mac1p-HA levels is highly specific to copper ions and is not essential for regulation of Cu(I) transport gene expression at low copper ion concentrations. Since high Cu(I) ion levels are known to activate transcription of genes encoding proteins such as the yeast metallothioneins, which protect cells from copper toxicity and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (15Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 16Culotta V.C. Howard W.R. Liu X.F. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 88: 8558-8562Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), an experiment was conducted to ascertain whether the reduction in Mac1p-HA steady state levels depends on the copper ion-dependent synthesis of new proteins. Yeast cells expressing the Mac1p-HA protein were pretreated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 30 min to inhibit new protein synthesis, followed by either no addition or the addition of 100 μmCuSO4. As shown in Fig. 2 B, Mac1p-HA levels were stable when cells were grown under low copper ion concentrations and in the presence of cycloheximide. However, Mac1p-HA levels were dramatically reduced when cells were incubated with copper ions under conditions where protein synthesis was inhibited. The levels of yeast HSF protein remained constant under both conditions over the course of the experiment (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the reduction in Mac1p-HA levels in response to high copper ion concentrations is not dependent on the synthesis of new proteins. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that high, but not low, copper ion concentrations rapidly and specifically trigger the degradation of Mac1p-HA. A dominant allele, MAC1 up1, encodes a Mac1 protein that is only partially responsive to copper and therefore drives robust transcription of the CTR1, CTR3, andFRE1 genes even in the presence of high copper ion concentrations (7Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 8Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

The MAC1 up1 mutation resides in one of two repeats that are located in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein, designated REP-I and REP-II, each containing 5 cysteines and 1 histidine residue (Fig.3 A, WT). To ascertain the role of the REP-I and REP-II elements in Cu(I) transporter gene regulation and to determine whether they are involved in copper ion-dependent degradation of Mac1p, all of the Cys and His residues were mutated in each independent REP element (Fig. 3 A, REP-I and REP-II). The analysis of CTR3mRNA levels in a strain expressing the wild type Mac1p (Fig.3 B, WT) gave typical rapid and complete inactivation ofCTR3 expression. In contrast, isogenic cells with theMAC1 up1 allele (up1) exhibited elevated basal CTR3 mRNA levels that were only transiently repressed by copper ions. Longer exposure of cells to copper ions resulted in sustained CTR3 expression as compared with wild type cells (Fig. 3 B, up1 ). The comparison of cells expressing either the REP-I or REP-IIMAC1 allele demonstrated strikingly distinct phenotypes with respect to CTR3 gene expression. REP-I cells displayed the transient but largely refractile response to copper ion levels similar to that observed with MAC1 up1 cells (Fig.3 B) or in Mac1 up2 (11Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) andMac1 up3 and Mac1 up4cells.2 Although we have ascertained that the copper ion-dependent turnover of Mac1p is not obligatory forCTR3 mRNA regulation, we observed in fact increasedCTR3 mRNA in strains with the Mac1up1 and REP-I MAC1 alleles. The fact that CTR3 expression in REP-I cells was slightly lower than inMAC1 up1 cells may be due to the multiple mutations in REP-I rather than a single amino acid substitution in the Mac1up1 protein. In yeast cells expressing the Mac1 REP-II protein, CTR3 mRNA levels were undetectable (Fig.3 B, compare REP-I and REP-II). These data demonstrate that, although identical mutations were made in the Mac1 REP-I and REP-II elements, these elements are not functionally equivalent with respect to their role in expression of the high affinity Cu(I) transport genes. This conclusion is strongly supported by additional experimental observations. First, the in vivoselection of yeast mutations linked to the MAC1 gene that exhibit high constitutive expression of the Cu(I) transport genes gave rise to single amino acid substitutions in REP-I, but not REP-II (Fig.3 A and Refs. 7Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Lee J. Romeo A. hassett R. Kosman D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 8Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, and 11Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Second, the kinetics of copper ion-dependent degradation of the protein expressed from theMAC1 REP-I allele were much slower than the wild type, with Mac1p-HA REP-I levels still detectable 90 min after copper ion treatment (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, Mac1p expressed from theMAC1 REP-II allele exhibited copper ion-dependent degradation kinetics indistinguishable from that of the wild type Mac1p (compare Figs. 1 A and3 C). Therefore, although the Mac1p-HA expressed from the REP-II allele is stable under low copper ion concentrations, it is incapable of activating CTR3 expression and is similar to a strain harboring a disrupted mac1::URA3 allele (8Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar,10Georgatsou E. Mavrogiannis L.A. Fragiadakis G.S. Alexandraki D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13786-13792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 11Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The observation that Mac1 REP-II protein, which is defective in activation of copper transporter gene expression, is degraded as well as the wild type protein, is likely due to the fact that copper ions (100 μm) are transported via the low affinity copper transport system. It should be noted that single or clustered point mutations in REP-II, in the context of a Gal4-Mac1 fusion protein, failed to exhibit a defect in regulating a GAL UAS-drivenlacZ gene in response to 100 μm copper (9Graden J.A. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We suggest two possible explanations. First, the fusion of Mac1 to the Gal4 DNA binding domain would mask any requirement for REP-II in Mac1 sequence-specific DNA binding to the CuREs (11Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Second, since the Mac1 REP-II mutant is subject to degradation when cells are incubated in the presence of high copper ion concentrations (Fig. 3 C), it is possible that regulation of the GAL UAS-lacZ fusion gene was due to copper ion-dependent degradation of the Gal4-Mac1 fusion protein. Although the REP-I and MAC1up1 cells are capable of high affinity Cu(I) transport and respiration, REP-II mutants are incapable of respiration, presumably because they are completely defective in expression of the high affinity Cu transport genes (Fig. 3 D). Finally, both the MAC1up1 and REP-I mutants are sensitive to copper in a manner that parallels the magnitude of sustained expression of the CTR3 gene, while the REP-II mutant is as resistant to copper as the parental wild type strain. Under the conditions used (Fig. 3 D) the high affinity Cu(I) transport genes contributes only modestly to the copper ion sensitivity of the Mac1up1 and REP-I strains. Nonetheless, when the copper transport genes are deleted (ctr1Δ ctr3Δ) in the Mac1up1 and REP-I strains, significant copper resistance is restored (Fig.3 D). It is intriguing that Mac1p, a key transcription factor required for both the activation of Cu(I) transport genes as a consequence of copper ion starvation, and copper ion-dependent inactivation of these genes, is regulated at two distinct levels by distinct copper ion concentrations. Since Mac1p binds the CuREs in vitro (11Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Serpe M. Haile D. Yang W. Kosman D.J. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17711-17718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and occupation of the CuREs in vivo directly correlates withCTR3 gene expression (8Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), the following model is consistent with the requirement for Mac1 in copper homeostasis. Under copper ion starvation conditions, Mac1p is stable and bound to the CuREs ofCTR1, CTR3, and FRE1, strongly activating gene transcription. Under copper ion concentrations that are low, but sufficient for growth, Mac1p DNA binding is reversibly inhibited, perhaps through the direct binding of copper ions to the REP-I or REP-II elements or indirectly via another copper ion sensor. Mac1p, however, is stably present to constantly survey the cellular copper status. Under conditions of copper ion excess (outside of the useful range of the high affinity Cu(I) transport system and within the range of metallothionein gene expression), Mac1p is rapidly degraded to completely eliminate expression of the Cu(I) transport machinery. Two observations support this model. First, the K m values for Ctr1p and Ctr3p in Cu(I) transport are approximately 2.5 and 5 μm, respectively (5Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 6Knight S.A.B. Labbé S. Kwon L.F. Kosman D.J. Thiele D.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1917-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); therefore, Mac1p degradation occurs at copper ion concentrations (10 μm) above the range in which Ctr1p and Ctr3p are useful to the cell. Second,MAC1 mutants that are defective in copper ion-dependent transcriptional inactivation of the high affinity Cu(I) transport genes, and copper ion-dependent degradation, exhibit increased sensitivity to copper toxicity in a manner dependent on the presence of the CTR1 andCTR3 genes. An elegant study has recently shown that Ctr1p is also degraded when yeast cells are grown in the presence of high, but not low, copper concentrations and that this degradation occurs at the plasma membrane and in the absence of new protein synthesis (18Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, the copper ion-dependent degradation of Mac1p and Ctr1p is likely to serve as an important cellular defense mechanism to minimize copper ion toxicity under conditions of copper excess. The regulated degradation of proteins provides a facile means of establishing homeostatic control in response to changes in cellular physiology. For example, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, a critical enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, is degraded via feedback control of the mevalonate pathway (19Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The yeast Gcn4p, a key transcription factor required for expression of amino acid biosynthetic genes, is degraded during amino acid repletion via the ubiquitin conjugation pathway (20Kornitzer D. Raboy B. Kulka R.G. Fink G.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6021-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the half-life of the mammalian iron-responsive element-binding protein-2 is dramatically decreased in iron replete, as compared with iron-starved cells, demonstrating that iron levels can regulate translation via modulation of the stability of this translational repressor protein (21Samaniego F. Chin J. Iwai K. Roualt T.A. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30904-30910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Guo B.Y.Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol.

Of particular relevance to the results presented here, the coordinate regulation of plastocyanin and cytochrome c 6, two reciprocal photosynthetic electron transfer proteins in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, is accomplished by copper ion starvation-mediated transcription of the cytochrome c 6 gene and stabilization of the holoplastocyanin protein as a consequence of copper ion repletion (24Li H.H. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23504-23510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the protease activity that degrades apoplastocyanin appears to be active only in copper ion-starved C. reinhardtii cells. What is the mechanism by which Mac1p is degraded by high, but not low, copper ion concentrations? One possibility, supported by the Mac1 mutational analysis, is that the binding of copper, at least in part via the REP-I element, may allow Mac1p to adopt a conformation or distinct subcellular localization that renders it susceptible to a pre-existing constitutively active protease. Alternatively, the REP-I region may be part of an important domain for recognition by an as yet unidentified copper ion-activated cellular protease. Although no copper-dependent proteases are currently known, the observation that trypsin can be engineered to a form that is highly stimulated by copper ion coordination (25Willett W.S. Brinen L.S. Fletterick R.J. Craik C.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5992-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) suggests that nature could adopt similar mechanisms to target-specific proteins for degradation in the presence copper ions. The demonstration that the Mac1 transcription factor is specifically degraded in the presence of high copper ion concentrations represents a new mechanism by which trace metals play important roles in cellular regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2130451686,"During the endomitotic cell cycle of megakaryocytic cell lines, the levels of cyclin B1 and the activity of cyclin B1-dependent Cdc2 kinase, although detectable, are reduced as compared with megakaryocytes undergoing a mitotic cell cycle. The levels of cyclin A, however, are comparable during both cell cycles. The expression of cyclin B1 mRNA is also equivalent in proliferating and polyploidizing cells. In the current study, we found that the rate of cyclin B1 protein degradation is enhanced in polyploidizing megakaryocytes. This finding has led us to further investigate whether the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway responsible for cyclin B degradation is accelerated in these cells. Our data indicate that polyploidizing megakaryocytic cell lines and primary bone marrow cells treated with the megakaryocyte proliferation- and ploidy-promoting factor, the c-Mpl ligand, display increased activities of the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, which degrades cyclin B, as compared with proliferating megakaryocytic cell lines or diploid bone marrow cells, respectively. This degradation has all the hallmarks of a ubiquitin pathway, including the dependence on ATP, the appearance of high molecular weight conjugated forms of cyclin B, and inhibition of the proteolytic process by a mutated form of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc4. Our studies also indicate that the ability to degrade cyclin A is equivalent in both the mitotic and endomitotic cell cycles. The increased potential of polyploid megakaryocytes to degrade cyclin B may be part of the cellular programming that leads to aborted mitosis. During the endomitotic cell cycle of megakaryocytic cell lines, the levels of cyclin B1 and the activity of cyclin B1-dependent Cdc2 kinase, although detectable, are reduced as compared with megakaryocytes undergoing a mitotic cell cycle. The levels of cyclin A, however, are comparable during both cell cycles. The expression of cyclin B1 mRNA is also equivalent in proliferating and polyploidizing cells. In the current study, we found that the rate of cyclin B1 protein degradation is enhanced in polyploidizing megakaryocytes. This finding has led us to further investigate whether the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway responsible for cyclin B degradation is accelerated in these cells. Our data indicate that polyploidizing megakaryocytic cell lines and primary bone marrow cells treated with the megakaryocyte proliferation- and ploidy-promoting factor, the c-Mpl ligand, display increased activities of the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, which degrades cyclin B, as compared with proliferating megakaryocytic cell lines or diploid bone marrow cells, respectively.

Our studies also indicate that the ability to degrade cyclin A is equivalent in both the mitotic and endomitotic cell cycles. The increased potential of polyploid megakaryocytes to degrade cyclin B may be part of the cellular programming that leads to aborted mitosis. During the mitotic cell cycle, cyclin B steadily accumulates at interphase and is rapidly degraded before the cells exit mitosis (reviewed in Ref. 1Rolfe M. Chiu M. Pagano M. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cyclin B degradation is essential for progression through to the next cell cycle. The specificity of cyclin B degradation is determined by the 9-amino acid motif conserved among the N termini of B-type cyclins (cyclin Box) (reviewed in Refs. 1Rolfe M. Chiu M. Pagano M. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and 2King R.W. Glotzer M. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1343-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Mutation of the conserved arginine in the cyclin box inhibits ubiquitination of cyclins in Xenopus extracts, indicating that the cyclin box serves as a signal for ubiquitination (3Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar, 4King R.W. Peters J.M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Cyclin A and B2, but not B1, require binding to p34Cdc2 for their proteolysis (5Stewart E. Kobayashi H. Harrison D. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6van der Velden H.M. Lohka M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 713-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). While some components involved in cyclin B ubiquitination and degradation have been identified, such as the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc4 (4King R.W. Peters J.M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and Ubc10 (7Townsley F. Aristarkhov A. Beck S. Hershko A. Ruderman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2362-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and enzymes Cdc16p, Cdc26p, Cdc27p, and Cdc23p in yeast (reviewed in Ref. 8King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), much has yet to be explored. Megakaryocytes undergo a unique cell cycle resulting in DNA replication in the absence of complete mitosis and cytokinesis. We and others found that during this cell cycle, DNA synthesis is not continuous, but rather consists of an S phase (of approximately 9 h) and a gap (of approximately 1–2 h) (9Wang Z. Zhang Y. Kamen D. Lees E. Ravid K. Blood. 1995; 86: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Odell Jr., T.T. Jackson C.W. Blood. 1968; 32: 102-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies aiming to investigate the nature of the gap phase during endomitosis led to the conclusion that mitosis is initiated but aborted at entry to anaphase (13Vitrat N. Le Couedic J.P. Pique C. Debili N. Vainchenker W. Blood. 1996; 88 (Abst. 1135): 287Google Scholar). It was found that polyploid megakaryocytes derived from bone marrow cells treated with the ploidy-promoting factor, the c-Mpl ligand (reviewed in Ref. 12Kaushansky K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), can condense their chromosomes when treated with nocodazole (13Vitrat N. Le Couedic J.P. Pique C. Debili N. Vainchenker W. Blood. 1996; 88 (Abst. 1135): 287Google Scholar). In this study, polyploid megakaryocytes were also found to display early features of prometaphase, such as spindle formation but not any characteristics of anaphase. Because of the rarity of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and the inability to obtain a pure population of diploid megakaryocytes to be used for synchronization and for following biochemical parameters during the development of high ploidy cells, we and others have resorted to megakaryocytic cell lines. It was found that during the endomitotic cell cycle in MegT and HEL cells the activity of the mitotic kinase, cyclin B1-dependent Cdc2 kinase, is reduced as compared with the activity during the mitotic cell cycle in these cells (10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Datta N.S. Williams J.L. Caldwell J. Curry A.M. Ashcraft E.K. Long M.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, however, the level of cyclin B1 protein is reduced, while the level of cyclin B1 mRNA is comparable in proliferating and polyploidizing megakaryocytes (10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Carrow et al. (15Carrow C.E. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1996; 88 (Abst. 1138): 287Google Scholar) detected cyclin B1 and a cyclin B1- and Cdc2-dependent kinase activities in nonsynchronized, high ploidy bone marrow megakaryocytes treated with the c-Mpl ligand, although it has not yet been investigated how the level of activity of these kinases compares with that in proliferating diploid megakaryocytes or other bone marrow cells. In this context, it should be mentioned that while cyclin B levels peak prior to the early stages of mitosis, some level of cyclin B and cyclin B-dependent Cdc2 kinase are also detected during S phase and are essential for progression through this phase of the yeast cell cycle (16Fisher D.L. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Early stages of mitosis, such as chromosome condensation, could be initiated by thenever-in-mitosis (NIMA)-type kinases in the absence of cyclin B-dependent Cdc2 kinase activity (17Osmani S.A. May G.S. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1495-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 18Lu K.P. Osmani S.A. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8769-8776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Abrogation of mitosis during polyploidization could result from a variety of reasons, including a premature degradation of cyclin B. This latter possibility could lead to the detection of lower levels of this cyclin during endomitosis. In the current study, we sought to investigate whether the activity of the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway responsible for cyclin B degradation is altered in polyploidizing megakaryocytes. Our data indicate that polyploidization is associated with increased activity of the ubiquitin pathway responsible for the recognition and proteolysis of cyclin B. This feature may be a part of cellular programming that leads megakaryocytes to abort mitosis during polyploidization. MegT cells (clone 37C1) were grown in a liquid culture, as described before (19Ravid K. Li Y.C. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To induce ploidy, 1 × 106 cells were seeded into a 75-cm2 culture flask and incubated in 5% CO2 at 39.5 °C for 4 or 5 days (10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Ravid K. Li Y.C. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were counted by hemocytometer, and cell viability was followed by staining with trypan blue. The attached cells as well as the detached cells were separately collected and subjected to various analyses. A clone (Y10/L8057) of the mouse megakaryocytic cell line L8057 (20Ishida Y. Levin J. Baker G. Stenberg P.E. Yamada Y. Sasaki H. Inoue T. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 289-298PubMed Google Scholar), selected by limited dilution based on its ability to express acetylcholinesterase (a unique marker for rodent megakaryocytes) (21Jackson C.W. Blood. 1973; 42: 413-421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to respond to 25 ng/ml PEG-rHuMGDF 1The abbreviations used are: PEG-rHuMGDF, pegylated recombinant human megakaryocyte growth and development factor; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; APC, anaphase-promoting complex; FCS, fetal calf serum. (generous gift of Amgen, Inc. Thousands Oaks, CA) by polyploidizing. Acetylcholinesterase activity was assayed as described before (9Wang Z. Zhang Y. Kamen D. Lees E. Ravid K. Blood. 1995; 86: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Culture conditions for this cell line were as described elsewhere (20Ishida Y. Levin J. Baker G. Stenberg P.E. Yamada Y. Sasaki H. Inoue T. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 289-298PubMed Google Scholar). Rat bone marrow cells were isolated from the femurs also as described before (22Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in a liquid culture under conditions that were previously shown to support maturation and ploidy of primary megakaryocytes (22Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23Kuter D.J. Greenberg S.M. Rosenberg R.D. Blood. 1989; 74: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in the presence of Iscove's modification of Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) and 20% horse serum supplemented with penicillin (2000 units/ml), streptomycin (200 μg/ml), l-glutamine (0.592 mg/ml), and when indicated with 50 ng/ml PEG-rHuMGDF for 3 days prior to collection of large mature megakaryocytes. Polyploidizing megakaryocytes of varying sizes (20-μm diameter and higher) were isolated from bone marrow cells derived from rat femurs (22Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and cultured for 3 days in the presence of 50 ng/ml of PEG-rHuMGDF, to promote megakaryopoiesis, and in the presence of a mixture of growth factors including 1 unit/ml erythropoietin (Amgen), 10 units/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and 5 units/ml of stem cell factor (Genzyme Corp., Boston, MA) to promote proliferation and survival of different bone marrow lineages, as we described before (22Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The isolation procedure involved mesh filtration (nylon mesh screens from Spectramesh, Spectrum Medical, Inc., Los Angeles, CA). To this end, clumps were initially removed by filtration through a 200-μm filter followed by filtration with a 17-μm filter, which allowed diploid cells to pass through the mesh. Cells retained on the filter were retrieved by washing the inverted filter with phosphate-buffered saline (136 mm NaCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). This procedure was repeated twice. We confirmed by counting cells under the light microscope and by staining for the unique marker for megakaryocytes, acetylcholinesterase (21Jackson C.W. Blood. 1973; 42: 413-421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that megakaryocytes were enriched to account for 60–70% of bone marrow cells (see Fig. 8 A), a level comparable with the purification method involving elutriation (24Doi T. Greenberg S.M. Rosenberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because of the size and content of megakaryocytes, in comparison with the small diameter bone marrow cells, the enrichment of megakaryocytic material (e.g. protein) would be substantially higher. Y10/L8057 cells grown in suspension were collected by centrifugation (380 × g, 5 min) in growth medium, and MegT cells adhering to the culture dish were stripped from the plate with a cell scraper, while nonadhering cells were collected separately by centrifugation. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml n-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. For Western blotting, 10 μg of lysed proteins were separated by 7.5 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schull) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The membrane was stained with 0.1% Ponceau S (Sigma) in 5% acetic acid to visualize protein bands. The membrane was destained with water, washed in TBS (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl) and blocked for 1 h with TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% dry milk. The blot was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 10 ml of TBST supplemented with a monoclonal antibody to cyclin B1 (GNS-1 diluted to 0.2 μg/ml), generated against the N-terminal domain of cyclin B between amino acids 1 and 21 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). This antibody cross-reacts with the corresponding murine protein, as tested by the manufacturers and by ourselves (10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). When indicated, a polyclonal antibody to cyclin B1, which does not block exclusively the N-terminal region of cyclin B, was used (26Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Lukas J. Baldin V. Ansorge W. Bartek J. Draetta G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A limited amount of this antibody was available to us, and thus most of the studies were performed with the commercial monoclonal antibody to cyclin B1. The blot was washed four times, each time for 10 min, and incubated for 1 h with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Corp.) at a 1:1500 to 1:3000 dilution in TBST. The blot was washed four times (each for 10 min) with TBST, and the Enhanced Chemiluminescence system (Amersham) was used for detection of proteins, as instructed by the manufacturer. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation (380 × g, 5 min). The volume of the pelleted cells was estimated, and the cells were washed again by centrifugation in the presence of 5 volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfolyl fluoride). Cells were resuspended in 2 volumes of hypotonic buffer and left on ice for 10 min prior to breaking by strokes in a glass homogenizer. Cells were spun down for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. Protein assay was performed on the supernatant as described in Ref. 10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar. Since adequate degradation was obtained with this preparation (27Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), we did not need to further clean the cytoplasmic extract by high speed centrifugation (100,000 ×g). Degradation of recombinant cyclin B was monitored as follows. Cytosolic extract (25 μg of protein) was added to a reaction mixture containing the following components in a final volume of 25 μl: 12 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 60 mm KCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP (or ATPγS), 20 mm creatine phosphate, 50–200 ng of recombinant cyclin B1 or cyclin A (Pharmingen), purified from salt by buffer exchange with an Amicon 30-kDa Filtration Unit (Amicon Beverly, MA). The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for the indicated time. When indicated, the cellular extract was pretreated with 0.15 units of apyrase (Sigma) for 20 min at 30 °C, after which the reaction was processed in the absence of ATP or creatine phosphate. Ubc4 and Ubc2 were obtained as described elsewhere (28Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Point mutations in Ubc4 and Ubc2 were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described in Ref.28Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar. Bone marrow was collected from femurs of rats as described before (22Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23Kuter D.J. Greenberg S.M. Rosenberg R.D. Blood. 1989; 74: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Marrows were suspended in 0.5 ml of CATCH buffer and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 4A5 monoclonal antibody ascites (29Burstein S.A. Friese P. Downs T. Mei R.L. Exp. Hematol. 1992; 20: 1170-1177PubMed Google Scholar) (generous gift of Sam Burstein, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center). The cells were then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG(Fab′)2 (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) for 30 min at 4 °C. Staining with propidium iodide was followed by determination of DNA content of 4A5 positive cells using a statistical package on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) as we described previously (10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Y10/L8057 cells were stained with propidium iodide and subjected to ploidy analysis also as described before (10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the current study, we assayed for cyclin B1 and Cdc2 levels during polyploidization of a megakaryocytic cell line, Y10/L8057, which we subcloned from L8057 cells (20Ishida Y. Levin J. Baker G. Stenberg P.E. Yamada Y. Sasaki H. Inoue T. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 289-298PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”), based on its ability to polyploidize in response to the megakaryocyte ploidy-promoting factor PEG-rHuMGDF (Fig.1). In the presence of PEG-rHuMGDF or of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a moderate or large fraction, respectively, of the cells underwent polyploidization, while the rest remained in the 2N proliferative mode (Fig. 1). Western blot analyses indicated that during polyploidization induced by these agents, the levels of cyclin B1, but not of Cdc2, were reduced (Fig.2). We next explored the possibility that reduced levels of cyclin B reflected an accelerated degradation of this protein in polyploidizing cells. As shown in Fig.3, the half-life of cyclin B1 in polyploid Y10/L8057/L8057 cells was substantially shorter than in proliferating cells. The enhanced degradation and reduced levels of cyclin B1 in polyploidizing megakaryocytes were not a result of cell cycle arrest, since cells induced to polyploidize displayed high rates of DNA synthesis (Table I).Figure 2The levels of cyclin B and Cdc2 in Y10/L8057 cells undergoing a mitotic or an endomitotic cell cycle. Y10/L8057 cells were cultured in IMDM medium containing 10% FCS alone (lane 1), supplemented with 50 ng/ml PEG-rHuMGDF (lane 2), or supplemented with 50 nm PMA (lane 3) for the time indicated. Cells were collected and subjected to Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody to cyclin B1 or Cdc2, as indicated under “Materials and Methods.” Equal loading of protein was confirmed by staining the nitrocellulose membrane with Ponceau S, as described before (10Zhang Y.

To test this possibility, cytosolic extracts were prepared from proliferating megakaryocytes or cells undergoing endomitosis. These extracts were incubated with recombinant cyclin B1, and cyclin B1 degradation was followed. As shown in Fig.4, a significant degradation of recombinant cyclin B was displayed by extracts from highly polyploidizing Y10/L8057 cells (treated with PMA), less from cells displaying moderate polyploidization (treated with PEG-rHuMGDF), but not in proliferating cells. A high level of cyclin B1 degradation (in PMA-treated cells) was dependent on the addition of ATP to the reaction, as typical of a ubiquitin-dependent degradation (30Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Cellular ATP was sufficient, however, to promote a low level of cyclin B degradation in the PEG-rHuMGDF-treated cells. Cyclin A protein is highly expressed in the megakaryocytic cell line, MegT, in HEL cells (10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Datta N. Williams J. Long M. Blood. 1993; 82: 209Google Scholar) and in Y10/L8057 cells undergoing polyploidization (Fig.5 A). Since cyclin A is also subjected to degradation via the ubiquitin pathway (reviewed in Ref.32Murray A. Cell. 1995; 81: 149-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), we examined whether the ability of polyploid megakaryocytes to degrade this cyclin is accelerated as was the case for cyclin B1. Interestingly, and in accordance with the detection of high levels of cyclin A in polyploid megakaryocytes, the ability of this latter cell type to degrade recombinant cyclin A was comparable with the rate displayed by proliferating cells (Fig. 5 B). MegT cells are megakaryocytes that have been immortalized with the temperature-sensitive large T antigen (19Ravid K. Li Y.C. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). At the permissive temperature (34 °C), the cells proliferate. At the nonpermissive temperature (39.5 °C), a fraction of the cells remain adhering to the dish and undergo a mitotic cell cycle, while the other fraction (in which T antigen is destroyed) detaches from the plate and undergoes an endomitotic cell cycle (10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). During this endomitotic process, the level of cyclin B protein, but not of cyclin A protein nor of cyclin B mRNA, is reduced, as compared with proliferating cells (10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J.

Cytosolic extracts were prepared from these proliferating megakaryocytes or from cells undergoing endomitosis. These extracts were incubated with recombinant cyclin B1, and cyclin B1 degradation was followed. As shown in Fig.6 A, a significant degradation of recombinant cyclin B was displayed by extracts prepared from polyploidizing cells. Cyclin B degradation was prevented in the presence of apyrase, which degrades ATP, or in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable (by the proteosomes) ATP analog, ATPγS. An additional hallmark of a ubiquitin-dependent degradation is the appearance of high molecular weight conjugates of cyclin B and ubiquitin. To detect these high molecular weight complexes, we also used a polyclonal antibody to cyclin B protein. This antibody, in contrast to the monoclonal antibody used in Fig. 6 A, is not directed against the N-terminal domain of cyclin B and thus should recognize ubiquitin-bound cyclin B. Indeed, as shown in Fig.6 B, high molecular weight conjugates of recombinant cyclin B appeared only in polyploid cells, depending on the availability of ATP. To test that the phenotype observed in Y10/L8057 and MegT cells is not exclusive to these cell lines, we prepared extracts from primary rat bone marrow cells cultured for 3 days in the absence or presence of PEG-rHuMGDF (reviewed in Ref. 12Kaushansky K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Under our liquid culture conditions, PEG-rHuMGDF did indeed increase the frequency and ploidy of megakaryocytes (TableII). A cellular extract prepared from PEG-rHuMGDF-treated bone marrow cells degraded recombinant cyclin B more efficiently than extract from diploid bone marrow cells (Fig.7). This was accompanied by a large shift of cyclin B to high molecular weight forms. It is technically impossible at this stage to purify significant quantities of proliferating, small megakaryocytes from primary bone marrow, thus preventing us from comparing the extent of cyclin B degradation in diploid versus polyploid megakaryocytes. We were, however, able to obtain a preparation of highly enriched polyploid megakaryocytes from bone marrow cells cultured with PEG-rHuMGDF (Fig.8 A). As shown in Fig.8 B, the rate of degradation of recombinant cyclin B1 by an extract derived from large megakaryocytes is significantly higher than the rate of degradation by diploid bone marrow cells. We realize that these results, although indicative, do not demonstrate conclusively that polyploidizing primary megakaryocytes display enhanced activity of the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway as compared with diploid megakaryocytes.Table IIDNA synthesis in proliferating and polyploidizing Y10/L8058 cellsDays in culture[3H]Thymidine incorporation2-acpm/cell × 10−4.ControlPMA23.94.933.77.32-a cpm/cell × 10−4. Open table in a new tab It has been reported that cyclin B degradation in other systems is mediated via the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc4 (4King R.W. Peters J.M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). We thus used a mutated form of Ubc4 in which cysteine 85 was replaced by serine. Such a protein was shown to act in vitro as a dominant negative mutant (28Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). Our data indicated that mutated Ubc4, but not mutated Ubc2 protein, slowed the rate of degradation of recombinant cyclin B by purified megakaryocytes (Fig. 9), indicating that Ubc4 mediates cyclin B degradation in this cell type. In some systems investigated, the lack of cyclin B1 alone is sufficient to drive endoreduplication. Endoreduplication in someDrosophila cell types is indeed associated with the lack of cyclin B1 (33Lehner C.F. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1990; 61: 535-547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Also, the metaphase II arrest in mouse oocytes is controlled through destruction of cyclin B1 (34Kubiak J.Z. Weber M. de Pennart H. Winston N.J. Maro B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3773-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Certain treatments, such as with inhibitors of protein kinases in mammalian cells or high levels of the protein encoded by rum1, which inhibits the mitotic kinase in fission yeast, block M phase and induce repeats of S phase (35Usui T. Yoshida M. Abe K. Osada H. Isono K. Beppu T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 36Moreno S. Labib K. Correa J. Nurse P. J. Cell Sci.

We found previously that polyploidization in megakaryocytic cell lines is associated with reduced levels of cyclin B1 protein, but not of cyclin A or of cyclin B1 mRNA, as compared with the levels in diploid cells (9Wang Z. Zhang Y. Kamen D. Lees E. Ravid K. Blood. 1995; 86: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this context, it is important to note that although cyclin B is important for the G2/M transition, low levels of cyclin B may also be needed for the S phase of yeast cell cycles (16Fisher D.L. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 38Stern B. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 534-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the current study, we found that cyclin B1 half-life in polyploidizing cells is decreased, as compared with that in proliferating cells. We thus explored the possibility that a reduced level of cyclin B1 during endomitosis reflects an enhanced ability of these cells to degrade this cyclin, since this may result in abrogated mitosis (13Vitrat N. Le Couedic J.P. Pique C. Debili N. Vainchenker W. Blood. 1996; 88 (Abst. 1135): 287Google Scholar). We found that polyploidization in the megakaryocytic cell lines MegT and Y10/L8057 or in primary megakaryocytes was associated with an enhanced ability of the cells to degrade recombinant cyclin B1 protein, as compared with the diploid proliferating megakaryocytic cell lines or nonmegakaryocytic bone marrow cells, respectively. Also, an extract of total bone marrow cells treated with the ploidy-promoting factor, the c-Mpl ligand, exhibited an augmented ability to degrade cyclin B, as compared with nontreated bone marrow cells. This proteolytic process displayed all of the hallmarks of a ubiquitin-dependent degradation (39Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), such as formation of high molecular weight complexes of cyclin, dependence on ATP, and competition by the mutated form of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc4. Many components are involved in ubiquitination and degradation of cyclin B. Cyclin B ubiquitination is regulated via the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc4 (4King R.W. Peters J.M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) and UbcX/Ubc10 (7Townsley F. Aristarkhov A. Beck S. Hershko A. Ruderman J. Proc.

Cell. 1995; 6: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Together with the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, these components promote polyubiquitination of cyclin B, which targets the protein to proteolysis by the 26 S proteosome. Besides Cdc16 and Cdc27, the identities of the components of APC in mammalian cells remain to be explored. The APC determines the specificity of degradation of different cyclins. King and colleagues (4King R.W. Peters J.M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) concluded that different cyclins are recognized by different components of the ubiquitination machinery. It was found that the cyclin A destruction box cannot functionally substitute for its B-type counterpart, indicating the existence of different components of the APC. Since cyclin A levels are elevated during the G1/S phase of the mitotic or endomitotic cell cycles in megakaryocytes (10Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and since our current study demonstrates that polyploidizing megakaryocytes do not display an enhanced ability to degrade recombinant cyclin A, it is reasonable to assume that a cyclin B1-specific component of the APC may be up-regulated during polyploidization. Future identification of the APC components will allow a further examination of this process, and one may speculate that ploidy-promoting factors may affect the expression of such an APC-specific component. We thank Carl Jackson, Richard Ashmaun, and Sam Lucas for skillful ploidy analysis of rat bone marrow cells."

Erythrocyte ankyrin, ankyrin 1, is the prototype of a family of homologous proteins that are involved in the local segregation of integral membrane proteins within functional domains on the plasma membrane (1Bennett V.

Hematol. 1993; 30: 85-118PubMed Google Scholar). This important cellular localization of membrane proteins may be provided by the relative affinities of the many different isoforms of ankyrin for target proteins. This specialization appears to have evolved through the tissue-specific, developmentally regulated expression of multiple protein isoforms. The molecular mechanisms by which ankyrin has acquired distinct isoforms with specialized function(s) are beginning to be revealed. The isoform diversity of ankyrin arises from both different gene products and from differential, alternative splicing of the same gene product (5Gallagher P. Tse W. Scarpa A. Lux S. Forget B. J.

In humans, the cDNAs for three ankyrin proteins have been cloned and their gene products studied. These ankyrins share similar antigenic sites and domain structures, differing in a number of ways such as their cellular patterns of expression and their relative affinities of binding to spectrin and band 3. Ankyrin binding has been described for a variety of proteins including membrane skeleton proteins, ion transport proteins, and cell adhesion molecules (1Bennett V. J. Biol.

Ankyrin 1, first discovered in preparations of erythrocyte membranes, provides the principal linkage between the spectrin-actin based erythrocyte membrane skeleton and the plasma membrane (1Bennett V.

The major form of ankyrin 1, ∼210 kDa, is composed of three domains, an 89-kDa NH2-terminal domain composed of 24 conserved repeats known as cdc 10/ankyrin repeats that contain the binding site for band 3; a 62-kDa domain that contains the binding sites for spectrin and vimentin; and a 55-kDa COOH-terminal regulatory domain (1Bennett V.

Studies performed in muscle cells suggested that ankyrin accumulation and assembly into the membrane was determined by a control mechanism operative at the posttranslational level, triggered near the time of cell fusion and onset of terminal differentiation (27Nelson W.J. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1726-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses by Birkenmeier and colleagues using an erythroid ankyrin 1 cDNA probe encoding the regulatory domain identified multiple transcripts in murine skeletal muscle RNA (13Birkenmeier C.S.

Northern blot analysis of RNA from chicken myotubes using an ankyrin 1 cDNA fragment as probe also identified a small 3.6-kb transcript (31Moon R.T. Ngai J. Wold B.J. Lazarides E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Isoform diversity in different muscle cell types is frequently determined by the presence of muscle type-specific isoforms (32Buckingham M.E.

These isoforms may be encoded by separate genes, may be generated by alternative splicing of a given gene, or may be controlled by specific regulatory elements in or around a given gene at different times. For example, numerous isoforms of spectrin with varying patterns of cellular localization and developmental expression have been identified in muscle cells (3Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. Kennedy S.P.

Sharp J.J. Barker J.E. Bloch R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One population was identified at the sarcolemma using an antibody to the spectrin binding domain of ankyrin. This localization is similar to previous observations. A second population was identified at the M and Z lines using an antibody to sequences identified previously in neural isoforms of ankyrin 1, also present in muscle (38Zhou D. Birkenmeier C.S. Williams M.W. Sharp J.J. Barker J.E. Bloch R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This report describes the cloning of a novel, truncated, muscle-specific ankyrin 1 isoform, characterization of its corresponding genomic structure, study of its pattern of expression, and identification of its promoter. Because of similarities detected on Western blotting, the isoform described here is likely to be the one detected at the sarcoplasmic reticulum, providing additional evidence that two populations of ankyrin 1 are present in muscle. These observations extend the molecular basis of ankyrin 1 isoform diversity to include the use of an alternate NH2 terminus and a tissue-specific alternate promoter. Total RNA was prepared from human skeletal muscle, or from the human tissue culture cell lines RD (human rhabdomyosarcoma, embryonal, ATCC 136-CCL), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis with erythroid characteristics, ATCC CCL 243), and HeLa (epithelioid carcinoma, cervix, ATCC CCL 2) as described previously (39Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Multiple-tissue Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA per tissue were obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). A human β-actin cDNA probe was used as a control for loading in Northern blot analyses (40Ng S.Y. Gunning P. Eddy R. Ponte P. Leavitt J. Shows T. Kedes L. Mol. Cell.

This fragment, which contains the entire coding region of the human ankyrin 1 muscle-specific cDNA (see below) was used as the hybridization probe to screen a random- and oligo(dT)-primed human skeletal muscle cDNA library in λgt11 (CLONTECH). A human ankyrin 1 cDNA fragment, pAnk15 (8Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), containing the 3′ end of the human ANK-1 muscle transcript was used as a hybridization probe to screen a human genomic DNA library. The library is a Charon4A bacteriophage library containing fragments of genomic DNA partially digested with AluI and HaeIII withEcoRI linkers added. For both library screens, selected recombinants that hybridized to the screening probes were purified, subcloned, and analyzed by standard techniques.Table IOligonucleotide primersA5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′B5′-TCATGCCGTCAGCCCAGAGGAATGTGTG-3′C5′-GCCAAGCTTGCGGTGGCCCTCAGGTCCAGCTC-3′D5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′E5′-TCTCATTCTCCACTGGGACC-3′F5′-GAGTCCCCCAGGGACCCCTTGC-3′G5′-CTGGGCAGGGCGGGGTTAGGC-3′H5′-GCCTAACCCCGCCCTGCCCAG-3′I5′-ACATGGGCACCTGCCGGCTT-3′J5′-AAGCCGGCAGGTGCCCATGT-3′K5′-GCTCCGGCAGCTGGTTTGGG-3′L5′-CCCAAACCAGCTGCCGGAGC-3′M5′-ATGGGCAGGATAGGTGAGAG-3′N5′-CTCTCACCTATCCTGCCCAT-3′O5′-CCCAACACCTGCTGCCTGAG-3′P5′-CTCAGGCAGCAGGTGTTGGG-3′Q5′-GGAATTCCTGTGGGGCGGGGCGCTCTAGAGC-3′R5′-GCTCTAGAGCGCCCCGCCCCACAGGAATTCC-3′S5′-CCCAACACCTGCTGCCTGAG-3′T5′-CTCAGGCAGCAGGTGTTGGG-3′U5′-CGCCTCTGGGGCCGATAAGGCCCTCGGGGG-3′V5′-CCCCCGAGGGCCTTATCGGCCCCAGAGGCG-3′ Open table in a new tab 5' RACE was performed as described (41Edwards J.B.

A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar). 1 μg of human skeletal muscle RNA was reverse transcribed using primer C (see Table I). Single-stranded oligonucleotide ligation and PCR amplification were carried out using primer D and primers A and B, respectively. Amplification products were subcloned and sequenced. The transcription start site of the muscle-specific ankyrin 1 cDNA isoform was determined using primer extension analysis. Primers E or F (see Table I) were used in primer extension reactions as described elsewhere (43Mason P. Enver T. Wilkinson D. Williams J. Hames B. Higgins S. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 47-54Google Scholar). Templates in these reactions were 20 μg of total RNA from the human cell lines RD and HeLa, or 10 μg of tRNA. The tissue culture cell lines C2C12 (murine muscle myoblast, ATCC 1772-CRL), RD, K562, and HeLa were used to study expression of the putative promoter of the muscle-specific isoform of the ankyrin 1 gene. C2C12, RD, and K562 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. C2C12 cells were maintained as myoblasts for all experiments described. Test plasmids were prepared by inserting a 2.1-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking ankyrin 1 muscle-specific genomic DNA upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene in the plasmid pGL2B (Promega, Madison, WI). Serial truncations of this 2.1-kb fragment in the pGL2B plasmid were constructed using convenient restriction enzyme sites or PCR amplification. Test plasmids were sequenced to exclude cloning or PCR-generated artifacts. All plasmids tested were purified using Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) and at least two preparations of each plasmid were tested. 107 K562 cells were transfected by electroporation with a single pulse of 300 V at 960 uF with 20 μg of test plasmid and 0.5 μg of pCMVβ, a mammalian reporter plasmid expressing β-galactosidase driven by the human cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter (CLONTECH). 105 C2C12 or HeLa cells were transfected with 2.0 μg of test plasmid and 0.25 μg of the pCMVβ plasmid by lipofection using 4 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed, and the activity of both luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was determined in cell extracts. All assays were performed in triplicate. Differences in transfection efficiency were determined by co-transfection with the pCMVβ plasmid. For transactivation assays, K562 and HeLa cells were transfected using 5 and 1 μg of reporter plasmid, respectively, and varying amounts of a MyoD cDNA expression plasmid, phMyoD (EMBL no. X56677), and reporter gene activity were assayed as above. Nuclear extracts were prepared from RD, C2C12, K562, and HeLa cells by hypotonic lysis, followed by high salt extraction of nuclei as described by Andrews and Faller (44Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out as described (45Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 46Strauss F. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 889-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Competitor oligonucleotides were added at molar excesses of 10- or 100-fold. Resulting complexes were separated by electrophoresis through 6% polyacrylamide gels at 21 °C. A rabbit-specific polyclonal antibody was raised to a synthetic peptide, ISPRVVRRRVFLKGN, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and bovine serum albumin (Immuno-Dynamics, La Jolla, CA). The sequence of this peptide is contained in the novel, muscle-specific region of ankyrin 1. After 12 weeks, anti-peptide antisera was collected, then affinity purified on a column to which the synthetic peptide had been covalently linked. Human erythrocyte membranes and skeletal muscle homogenates were prepared as described previously (47Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 48Kunimoto M. Otto E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These erythroid and muscle fractions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4–20% gel and either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred onto nitrocellulose and immunoblotted. Immunoblotting was performed as described elsewhere (49Davis J. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7757-7766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Computer-assisted analyses of derived nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were performed utilizing the sequence analysis software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (UW GCG; Madison, WI) (50.Genetics Computer Group (1994) Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8.0, Madison, WI.Google Scholar) and the BLAST algorithm, National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD) (51Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). Northern blot analyses of human skeletal muscle RNA with human ankyrin 1 erythroid cDNA probes encoding the repeat-domain (pAnk58), the spectrin-binding domain (pAnk37), or the regulatory domain (pAnk15) (8Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) yielded hybridization signals of 2.3 and 1.6 kb only when the regulatory domain probe was used (see below). These results are in contrast to Northern blot analyses of human erythroid RNA using these probes where hybridization signals of 7.3 and 9.0 kb are seen with all three domain-specific probes (7Lambert S. Yu H. Prchal J.T. Lawler J. Ruff P. Speicher D. Cheung M.C. Kan Y.W. Palek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1730-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). To identify the molecular basis of these truncated transcripts, we performed 5′ RACE using oligonucleotide primers A (sense, linker) and B and C (antisense, both in the 3′-untranslated region of the erythroid cDNA), with total human skeletal muscle RNA as a template. This yielded a set of cDNA products, the longest 838 bp in length. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this product revealed a novel 5′ end including 5′-untranslated sequences, an initiator methionine, and 219 bp of novel sequence with an open reading frame. The 3′ end of this RACE product was composed of sequences previously identified in erythroid or neural ankyrin 1 cDNA transcripts, including 309 bp of 3′ in-frame sequence. This 838-bp skeletal muscle RACE product was used as probe to screen a human skeletal muscle cDNA library. Eight clones that hybridized to the screening probe were isolated after primary screening of a human skeletal muscle cDNA library. Three clones were purified, subcloned and sequenced (Fig.1). The clones varied in size from 1096 to 2543 bp. All three clones contained 5′-untranslated sequence, an open reading frame of 528 bp (the same identified in the RACE product) and 3′-untranslated sequences (Fig.2 A). Primer extension predicted an additional 43 bp of upstream sequence from the end of clone λ2, the clone extending the most 5′ of analyzed clones (not shown). An additional 42 bp of upstream 5′ untranslated sequence was obtained by 5′ RACE. Sequences obtained by RACE were verified by comparison to corresponding genomic DNA sequences (see below). The sequences around the transcription start site, CCA+1CTCA, closely match transcription initiation recognition sequences, YYA+1NWYY (52Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that this cDNA sequence is at or very near the 5′ end of the ankyrin 1 muscle cDNA.Figure 2Nucleotide sequence with predicted amino acid sequence of human ankyrin 1 muscle cDNA. A, a composite nucleotide sequence shown was determined from clones λ2, λ6, and 5′ RACE products. The initiation codon and the termination codons aredouble underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two different untranslated regions were identified in the λ cDNA clones, λ6 and λ47 (Fig. 1). The first 422 bp of the 3′ untranslated region of λ6 are identical to those in the ankyrin 1 erythroid 3′-untranslated region, then the sequence diverges (Fig.2 A). The first 322 bp of the 3′-untranslated region of λ47 are identical to those in the ankyrin 1 erythroid 3′-untranslated region, then the sequence diverges (Fig. 2 B). A polyadenylation consensus signal was not identified in either clone. These novel 3′-untranslated sequences did not match any sequences in the available data bases and were not contained in our most 3′ ankyrin 1 genomic clones. The predicted initiator methionine is located at positions 251–253 (Fig. 2 A). The sequences around this translation start site match important consensus sequences, specifically, there is an A in position −3 from the predicted initiator methionine (53Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar). A termination codon is located 150 bp upstream of the predicted initiator methionine; no additional ATGs are present in the intervening 150 bp. Deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame predicts a peptide of 155 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17.6 kDa and a pI of 6.5. Secondary structure predictions of the muscle-specific protein predict the presence of two domains, a highly charged NH2-terminal domain followed by a COOH-terminal domain composed of alternating α helix and β sheet. These sequences do not contain the membrane binding domain, the spectrin/fodrin binding domain, and most of the regulatory domain found in the erythroid ankyrin 1 gene transcript. Two overlapping genomic DNA clones were isolated that contained the entire ankyrin 1 muscle cDNA sequence. Analysis of its structure revealed that this transcript is composed of 4 exons spread over ∼10 kb of DNA (Fig. 3, top). There is a novel exon one, followed by sequences present in the erythroid cDNA transcripts encoded by exons 40, 41, and 42. This novel exon 1, labeled 39a in Fig. 3, is located in intron 39 of the erythroid gene. The first and fourth exons contain untranslated sequences; the 5′-untranslated region is 250 bp in length. Comparison of the exon/intron boundaries with reported consensus sequences reveals that the ag:gt rule was not violated at any splice junction (54Horowitz D.S. Krainer A.R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 100-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 55Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). There are no AG dinucleotides within the 15 bp upstream of the 3′ (acceptor) splice junctions. The coding sequences for the hydrophobic domain of the ankyrin 1 muscle protein are contained entirely within the novel exon one. Additional RACE products identified three additional muscle-specific isoforms generated by alternative splicing (Fig.4, isoforms 2–4). Comparison of these isoforms with the genomic organization demonstrate that these four isoforms vary in their usage of exon 41. The function of these isoforms is unknown. In erythroid and neural tissue, complex patterns of alternative splicing of exon 41 have been observed (5Gallagher P. Tse W. Scarpa A. Lux S. Forget B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19220-19228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the patterns of alternative splicing observed in muscle cDNA differ from those observed in erythroid and neural cDNA isoforms. Northern blot analysis usi"
https://openalex.org/W2052222199,"Recently we have reported that the adaptor protein Crk transmits signals to c-Jun kinase (JNK) through C3G, a guanine-nucleotide exchange protein for the Ras family of small G proteins. Transient expression of C3G in 293T cells induced JNK1 activation without a significant effect on extracellular signal-related kinase 1 (ERK1), whereas mSos1 activated equally both JNK1 and ERK1. Coexpression of the dominant negative form of Ras-N17 did not suppress C3G-induced JNK1 activation but reduced the activity of JNK1 induced by mSos1, suggesting that Ras is not required for JNK activation by C3G. Ras-independent activation of JNK was supported by the finding that C3G-induced JNK activation was not inhibited by the dominant negative forms of Rac or Pak, which are components of the signaling pathway from Ras leading to JNK activation. In contrast, C3G-induced JNK1 activation was strongly inhibited by coexpression of the kinase negative forms of the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family of proteins, MLK3 and dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK). In addition, MLK3-induced JNK1 activation was found to be suppressed by the kinase negative form of DLK, which bound to MLK3. These results suggest that C3G activates JNK1 through a pathway involving the MLK family of proteins.

These results suggest that C3G activates JNK1 through a pathway involving the MLK family of proteins. C3G was originally isolated as a binding partner for the SH3 domain of Crk (1Tanaka S.

The sequence homology of the catalytic domain of C3G suggested that C3G is a guanine-nucleotide exchange protein for the Ras family of small G proteins (1Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In fact, C3G complements the lack of function of CDC25, a Ras guanine-nucleotide exchange protein in yeast (1Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K.

S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, the responsible small GTPase pathway that functions as a substrate for C3G and transmits signals to JNK remains unidentified. The small GTPase, Ras, has been reported to transmit a range of signals in response to various stimuli, including a well established pathway to ERK activation for cell cycle progression (9Sato T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Downward J. Curr.

Sequential activation of serine/threonine kinases such as c-Raf-1 and MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) downstream of Ras has been shown to be involved in ERK activation (11Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.-W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biol. Chem. 1994; 19: 474-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In addition, recent reports have shown that Ras also activates JNK via the Rho family of small G proteins, Rac or Cdc42 (12Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu Y.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T.

Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell.

Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), in the present study we have examined the possibility that Ras may play a critical role in C3G-mediated signal transduction in JNK activation. Mammalian expression plasmids, pCAGGS-C3G, pCAGGS-C3G-F, pCAGGS-mSos1, and pCAGGS-mSos1-F were gifts from Michiyuki Matsuda (NIH, Japan), pcDNA3-HA-JNK1, pCEF-GST-Pak-N, pcDNA3-Ras-N17, pCEV29-RhoA-N19, pCEFL-MLK3, and pCEFL-MLK3-K114R were from Silvio J. Gutkind (NIH). pCEP-EE-Rap-N17 was from Laurence Quilliam, pEF-BOS-HA-Rac-N17 and pEF-BOS-HA-Cdc42-N17 were from Kouzo Kaibuchi (NAIST, Japan), pcDNA3-Flag-DLK and pcDNA3-Flag-DLK-K185A were from Lawrence B. Holzman (University of Michigan), and pEBG-Sek1 and pEBG-Sek1-KR were from Leonald I. Zon (Harvard University). Expression plasmids for ΔMEKK1 and ΔMEKK1-KR were constructed using pFC-MEKK (Stratagene). The expression plasmid for TC21/R-Ras2-N17 was from Andrew M. Chang (Mount Sinai Medical School, New York). Anti-C3G (C-19), anti-Sos1/2 (D-21), anti-Rac1 (C-14), anti-Cdc42Hs (P1), anti-JNK1 (C-17), and anti-MLK3 (C18) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Inc. Anti-pan-Ras antibody (Ab-3), anti-HA antibody, and anti-Flag antibody (M2) were obtained from Calbiochem, Boehringer Mannheim, and Kodak, respectively. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum using a plastic dish 60 mm in diameter, and DNAs were introduced into cells using a modified calcium-phosphate transfection system (Stratagene). The procedures of cell lysis and immunoblotting were described elsewhere (12Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu Y.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). JNK and ERK kinase activities were measured by in vitro kinase assay described elsewhere using GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–79) and myelin basic protein, respectively, as substrates (12Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu Y.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Incorporated radio isotope activities with each substrate were measured, and the results are shown as bar graphs. Because Ras in its GTP bound state can activate JNK by a Rac, Cdc42, Pak, MEKK1, Sek1/MKK4 signaling cascade, we wanted to investigate whether C3G activated JNK via this pathway. To evaluate the effects of C3G on Ras, we measured the potential of C3G to activate the MAPKs, JNK1, and ERK1 and compared this with mSos1, which is an authentic activator for Ras. cDNAs for C3G or mSos1 were transiently coexpressed with either epitope tagged JNK1 or ERK1 in human embryo kidney 293T cells. JNK1 or ERK1 activity was then measured by an in vitro kinase assay using either GST-c-Jun or myelin basic protein as substrates. As shown in Fig.1 A, C3G preferentially activated JNK1 compared with ERK1 when compared with the positive controls, which were UV irradiation or Ras-V12 expression. In contrast, mSos1 activated both JNK1 and ERK1 to a similar extent. The protein expression levels of each molecule in the JNK and ERK kinase assays were examined by immunoblotting and are shown in Fig. 1 (Band C, respectively). The results suggested that Ras may not be involved in the C3G-induced activation of JNK1. We also tested the effects of membrane targeted forms of C3G or mSos1 using a farnesylation acceptable sequence on JNK1 or ERK1 activation in a transient protein expression system, because it is known that stably expressed Sos-F strongly activates ERK1 in murine fibroblasts compared with wild type mSos1 (Ref. 18Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar and data not shown). Unlike the results obtained in the stable protein expression system, we found that the presence of a farnesylation targetting sequence on either C3G or mSos1 did not result in a significant increase in ERK1 or JNK1 activity compared with the cytoplasmic derivatives (Fig. 1 A). It is conceivable that high levels of C3G or mSos1 expression in the transient expression system may permit easy contact with their substrates localized in the vicinity of the membrane, and thus farnesylation does not result in further increases in kinase activation. Therefore we used wild type C3G and mSos1 for further analysis of the downstream signaling pathway of C3G-induced JNK activation. A reciprocal experiment to test whether C3G-dependent activation of JNK is regulated by Ras involves dominant negative Ras-N17 protein. Although coexpression of Ras-N17 significantly reduced mSos1-induced JNK activation, cotransfection of Ras-N17 did not have any effect on C3G-induced JNK1 activation even on the mild 2.5-fold activation resulting from transfection of reduced amounts of C3G (Fig.2 A). In agreement with Fig. 1, these data suggest that C3G activates JNK1 in a Ras-independent manner. C3G has been reported to activate Rap1 in an in vitroguanine-nucleotide exchange assay (2Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 15: 6746-6753Crossref Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether a dominant negative form of Rap1, Rap-N17, can suppress C3G-induced JNK1 activation. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the coexpression of Rap1-N17 did not suppress either C3G or mSos1-induced JNK1 activation, suggesting that Rap1 is also not involved in JNK activation. In addition, N17 TC21/R-Ras2, a dominant negative form of another member of the Ras family of proteins, did not inhibit C3G-induced JNK1 activation. 2S. Tanaka and A. M. Chang, unpublished results. Recently, it has been shown that JNK can be activated by Rac, a member of the Rho family of GTPase. Although Rac1-N17 strongly suppressed mSos1-induced JNK1 activation (Fig. 2 B), such a mutant again failed to have an observable effect on C3G-mediated JNK activation. Similar results were obtained by RhoA-N19 or Cdc42-N17 (data not shown), suggesting that none of the Rho family GTPase binds C3G to JNK activation. It should be noted that Rac1-N17 caused a more profound suppression of mSos1-induced JNK1 activation than Ras-N17 with 90 and 60% reductions, respectively, being observed (Fig. 2 B). This discrepancy can be explained if we assume that Rac1 can be directly activated by mSos1 through the Dbl homology domain of mSos1. Because one of the homologues of the yeast Ste20, serine/threonine kinase Pak1 that bound to Rac and Cdc42 has been reported to activate JNK (14Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), we examined the involvement of Pak1 in C3G-induced JNK1 activation. In 293T cells, the N terminus region of Pak1 (Pak-N) lacking the kinase domain that has been reported to have a dominant negative function against Rac- or Cdc42-induced JNK activation (19Teramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T. Xu N. Gutkind S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) was found not to suppress C3G-induced JNK1 activation, whereas Pak-N did block Cdc42-induced JNK1 activation in our system as has been previously reported (19Teramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T. Xu N. Gutkind S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A). In addition to the Ste20 homologues, a newly emerging class of kinases, the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family of proteins including MLK1 (20Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Krester T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), MLK2/MST (21Katoh M. Hirai M. Sugimura T. Terada M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1447-1451PubMed Google Scholar, 22Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Tu G.F. Price G. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Simpson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), MLK3/SPRK/PTK1 (23Gallo K.A. Mark M.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported to regulate JNK activation. Specifically, MLK3, which has a SH3 domain and a CRIB (Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding) domain (27Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), has been shown to play a Pak1-like role such as MAPK kinase kinase and transmit signals to JNK (28Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the role of MLK3 in C3G-dependent signaling to JNK1. Interestingly, co-expression of the kinase negative form of MLK3-K144R suppressed C3G-induced JNK1 activation (Fig.3 B). In these experiments, we used Cdc42-V12 and a truncated form of ΔMEKK1 that has been shown to activate JNK1 as positive and negative controls, respectively, for the estimation of the dominant negative effect of MLK3 (Fig. 3 B), because MLK3 has been shown to function between Cdc42 and MEKK1 (28Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In control experiments (Fig. 3 C) JNK activation could only be observed with native MLK3 but not kinase negative MLK3. The results (Fig. 3, Aand B) suggest the possible involvement of MLK3 rather than Pak1 in C3G-induced JNK1 activation. Because MLK3 has been shown to transmit signals to MEKK1 (28Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), we examined a role for MEKK1 in C3G-dependent JNK1 activation. As shown in Fig.4 A, expression of the kinase negative form of ΔMEKK1-KR attenuated by approximately 50% the C3G-induced JNK1 activation. Because the suppression of C3G-induced JNK1 activation by ΔMEKK1-KR was partial, it is possible that another molecule functions as MAPK kinase kinase for JNK1 instead of MEKK1. Because one of the MLK family of proteins, DLK, has been shown to function as a MEKK1-like protein (29Fan G. Merritt S.E. Kortenjann M. Shaw P.E. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24788-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we examined a possible role for DLK and found that coexpression of kinase negative form of DLK-K185A clearly suppressed the C3G-dependent JNK1 activation in 293T cells (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, it can be demonstrated that wild type DLK can activate JNK1 in 293T cells (Fig. 3 C,lane 5). Because C3G-induced JNK1 activation was suppressed by dominant negative forms of both MLK3 and DLK, we examined whether MLK3 activates JNK through DLK in 293T cells. Because MLK3 has been reported to function as a Pak1-like protein (28Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27225-27228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and DLK as a MEKK1-like protein (29Fan G. Merritt S.E. Kortenjann M. Shaw P.E. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24788-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), it is likely that MLK3 lies upstream to DLK. We found that the kinase negative form of DLK-K185A strongly suppressed the MLK3-induced JNK1 activation (Fig. 4 C). We could also demonstrate the interactions of overexpressed MLK3 and DLK-K185A in 293T cells (Fig.4 D). Although the mechanisms of the interactions of MLK3 and DLK are unknown, this association may well contribute to the suppression of MLK-induced JNK1 activation by DLK-K185A. The data suggest that both MLK3 and DLK may be involved in the signaling pathway in C3G-induced JNK1 activation in 293T cells (Fig.5). Our present studies suggest that C3G-mediated signaling pathway to JNK1 occurs in a Ras-independent mechanism. Consistent with this idea, Rac, which is a major signal transducer for Ras to JNK1, does not have any role in C3G-induced JNK1 activation. Furthermore, we have shown that another member of the Ras family of proteins Rap1 does not induce JNK1 activation downstream of C3G. Downstream signaling of Rap1 may involve the activation of ERK1 through B-Raf under cAMP stimulation (30Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.-G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Recently, R-Ras has been shown to be activated by both C3G and Ras-GRF/Cdc25Mm in in vitro assays (3Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that R-Ras could transmit signals to Akt through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase but not to ERK and JNK (31Marte B.M. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the responsible small GTPase that may serve as a substrate of C3G and at the same time induce JNK1 activation. In this study, we have examined the involvement of serine/threonine kinases in C3G-induced JNK activation and clearly showed that kinase negative forms of the MLK family of proteins, MLK3 and DLK, suppress C3G-induced JNK1 activation in 293T cells. Although one should be cautious about the possibility that a dominant negative form of kinases transiently overexpressed in cells could block the function of related family of proteins, our observations strongly suggest a possible role for the MLK family of proteins in C3G signaling to JNK1.

A cell line with a density of 1.3 × 106 receptors/cell allowed us to carry out a detailed study of BK-receptor interaction over a wide range of BK concentrations. A model assuming that BK binds to two receptor affinity states (depending on guanine nucleotide-sensitive coupling) was not sufficient to account for the kinetics of BK binding. Equilibrium kinetic analysis and studies of the effects of receptor occupancy by agonists or antagonists on the kinetics of BK-receptor complex dissociation revealed features typical of negative cooperative binding. The negative cooperativity phenomenon was also observed in isolated membranes in both the presence and absence of guanine nucleotide. Thus, following the interaction with BK, B2 receptor molecules likely interact with each other, resulting in an acceleration of bound ligand dissociation and a decrease in the apparent affinity of the receptor for BK. This phenomenon can participate in the desensitization process.

PLC stimulation produces the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is likely responsible for the release of Ca2+ from internal stores (13Quitterer U. Schröder C. Müller-Esterl W. Rehm H. J. Biol.

The receptor-mediated desensitization can contribute, together with the action of kininases and the triggering of physiological counter-regulatory mechanisms, to the limitation of the physiological action of the peptide in vivo and reduce the potential therapeutic interest of agonists. After the obtainment and pharmacological characterization of a recombinant human renal BK B2 receptor that was expressed at high density in CHO-K1 cells, we studied in detail the kinetics of BK interaction with the receptor. This study was performed because analysis of previous studies revealed large variations, by >4 orders of magnitude, in the affinity constants reported for BK (4Hess J.F. Borkowski J.A. Young G.S.

The present work demonstrates, with the analysis of BK-receptor interaction over a wide range of ligand concentrations and dissociation kinetic experiments, a new property of the B2 receptor, which is negative cooperativity in the binding of BK, a phenomenon described so far for a few seven-transmembrane domain receptors (27Chazenbalk G.D.

No [3H]BK binding and no BK activation of PLC and PLA2 were detected in nontransfected CHO-K1 cells. One clone (hB2r-CHO) with a high density of [3H]BK-binding sites (1.3 × 106sites/cell) was used for the experiments. The recombinant receptor in this clone exhibited biochemical and pharmacological features typical of a bradykinin B2 receptor subtype. BK application induced PLC and PLA2 activation with EC50 values of 0.22 ± 0.06 (n = 3) and 1.10 ± 0.20 (n = 3) nm and maximal stimulation of 33- and 6-fold the basal value, respectively. BK application elevated the cytosolic calcium concentration. Also, as reported for other B2 receptor-expressing cells (7Roscher A.A. Manganiello V.C. Jelsema C.L. Moss J. J. Clin.

Chem. 1992; 267: 303-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PLC, PLA2, and calcium responses were desensitized following BK application. This was associated with internalization of cell-surface binding sites, a highly temperature-sensitive process that occurred as complexes with BK as evidenced by an acid-salt washing technique. Using 2 × 10−8m [3H]BK, the internalization represented 62.0 ± 10.7% of the total binding determined after a 1-h incubation at 37 °C (n = 5) and only 4.4 ± 2.7% (n = 5) when the binding assay was performed for 16 h at 4 °C. The EC50values (BK concentration during preincubation) for the desensitization of PLC and PLA2 responses to 10−7m BK were roughly of 0.1 and 2 nm, respectively. Finally, [3H]BK binding was specifically inhibited by B2 receptor agonists and antagonists, and PLC was selectively activated by B2 receptor agonists (TableI). A peculiarity of hB2r-CHO cells that might be related to receptor overexpression is that none of the BK-induced phenomena ([3H]BK binding, receptor internalization rate, and activation of PLC or PLA2) were sensitive to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and staurosporine, an activator and an inhibitor of protein kinase C, respectively (data not shown). It is conceivable that the protein kinase C content in CHO cells is low compared with the receptor content and that only a small undetectable portion of the receptors could be altered by protein kinase C.Table IEffects of various structural analogues of BK on [3 H]BK binding and IP production in hB 2 r-CHO cellsAnaloguesconc[3H]BK binding1-aResults are expressed as a percentage of binding of [3H]BK in the absence of competitor.IP production with analogueAlone1-bResults are expressed as a percentage of IP production induced by 10−7m and 1 nm BK, respectively.With 1 nm BK1-cResults are expressed as a percentage of IP production induced by 10−7m and 1 nm BK, respectively.m%%B2agonists BK10−78.5 ± 0.7 [Hyp3, Tyr(Me)8]BK10−73.0 ± 0.7110.6 ± 16.9127.0 ± 11.5 [Aib7]BK10−531.1 ± 1.3164.1 ± 14.1168.2 ± 14.3B2 antagonists HOE 14010−53.8 ± 0.40.4 ± 0.45.1 ± 1.1 d-Arg-[Hyp3,d-Phe7,Leu8]BK10−571.5 ± 2.023.8 ± 6.665.4 ± 0.4B1 analogues Des-Arg9-BK10−5100.4 ± 9.01.4 ± 0.585.0 ± 16.3 Lys-des-Arg9-BK10−5102.8 ± 7.61.0 ± 0.474.7 ± 11.1 Des-Arg9[Leu8]BK10−5104.9 ± 7.43.2 ± 0.4100.1 ± 2.91-a Results are expressed as a percentage of binding of [3H]BK in the absence of competitor.b,c Results are expressed as a percentage of IP production induced by 10−7m and 1 nm BK, respectively. Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 illustrates a comparison of the equilibrium binding of a very wide range of [3H]BK concentrations (from 3 × 10−10 to 10−7m) at 37 and 4 °C. Fig. 1 a shows that 4 and 37 °C binding curves were not superimposable. The binding was greater at 4 °C than at 37 °C at low [3H]BK concentrations, and the opposite was observed when the [3H]BK concentration exceeded 5 × 10−8m. At both temperatures, maximal binding was not achieved at the highest [3H]BK concentration tested. The data gave curvilinear plots (Fig. 1 b) when tested according to Scatchard (37Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17758) Google Scholar), whereas Hill plots (Fig. 1 b,inset) gave straight lines (r = 0.99) that differed (p < 0.05) in their slope and gave Hill coefficient values below 1: 0.54 ± 0.09 and 0.71 ± 0.05 for binding at 4 and 37 °C, respectively. These observations indicate that at both temperatures, [3H]BK binds to a heterogeneous population of binding sites with differing affinities or in a negative cooperative manner, which implies that receptor affinity decreases with increased receptor occupancy (38Christoffersen C.T. Bornfeldt K.E. Rotella C.M. Gonzalez N. Vissing H. Shymko R.M. Ten Hoeve J. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. De Meyts P. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). They also indicate that the internalization of the [3H]BK-receptor complexes that occurs at 37 °C is accompanied by a recycling of the receptor back to the cell surface, which explains why maximal binding is greater at 37 °C than at 4 °C. The fact that, at low [3H]BK concentrations, the binding was less at 37 °C than at 4 °C will be discussed later.All experiments described below were aimed at testing the hypothesis of negative cooperativity among the B2 receptors. This was done by studying in intact cells or cell membranes the dissociation of the BK-receptor complexes especially with regard to whether or not it depends on the receptor occupancy level. When intact cells were used, experiments were performed at 4 °C to avoid ligand-receptor internalization and enzymatic alterations of the receptor. Fig.2 a shows that the dissociation of [3H]BK-receptor complexes had at least two components with differing rates. The presence of unlabeled BK during the dissociation reaction accelerated the complex dissociation. Thus, the rate of the slowest dissociation component, which was 2.2 ± 0.5 10−4 min−1 in the absence of unlabeled BK, increased to 6.6 ± 1.9 and 11.5 ± 1.9 10−4min−1 when 2 and 100 nm unlabeled BK, respectively, were present in the solution, indicating that the unlabeled BK accelerating effect occurs in a dose-dependent manner. The dose dependence of this effect was studied in more detail in cells previously labeled with 2 nm [3H]BK (Fig. 2 b). The acceleration of [3H]BK dissociation was detected with 4 × 10−10m BK (p < 0.05) in these cells and was maximal at ∼1 μm unlabeled BK. These observations clearly demonstrate that occupancy of free binding sites by unlabeled BK results in an accelerated dissociation of already bound [3H]BK. Furthermore, the greater the number of binding sites occupied by unlabeled BK, the faster the dissociation of the complex.Figure 2Accelerated dissociation of bound [3H]BK by unlabeled BK. All experimental steps were carried out at 4 °C. They included a 20-h incubation of cells with 2 nm [3H]BK, extensive washing with HBSS containing 0.1% BSA to remove unbound [3H]BK, and a second incubation in the absence or presence of unlabeled BK with determination of the specific binding fractions that were released in the medium or remained associated with cells. The cell-associated binding is expressed as a percentage of the specific binding determined just before the dissociation reaction. a, the second incubation was performed for the different indicated times without (no addition) or with unlabeled BK (2 or 100 nm). The slope of the regression lines corresponding to cell-associated binding values at 60, 180, and 300 min was determined to estimate the dissociation rate constant given under “Results.”b, the second incubation was performed for 3 h with the indicated unlabeled BK concentrations. Values are from three independent experiments, each performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The dependence of BK-receptor dissociation on receptor occupancy was also demonstrated by the experiments depicted in Fig.3, which shows that, in the absence of unlabeled BK, the dissociation of bound [3H]BK was faster when there was an initial occupancy of a greater number of binding sites. The dissociation rates of the slow component were 0.8 ± 0.2 and 3.7 ± 1.2 10−4 min−1 with initial occupancies of 0.050 ± 0.005 and 0.951 ± 0.130 pmol of [3H]BK/mg of protein, respectively.Figure 3Dependence of [3H]BK dissociation rate on receptor occupancy level. Experiments were conducted and data were expressed as explained in the legend to Fig.2 a, except that cells were labeled with 10−10or 10−8m [3H]BK, and no unlabeled BK was added during the dissociation reaction. The specific binding before dissociation was 0.050 ± 0.005 and 0.951 ± 0.130 pmol of [3H]BK/mg of protein, respectively. The dissociation rate constants given under “Results” were estimated from cell-associated binding values at 120, 180, 300, and 480 min. Values are from three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table II summarizes the effects of various structural BK analogues on [3H]BK dissociation studied at 4 °C using the same experimental conditions used as for BK. The effects of these analogues on [3H]BK binding and PLC activity at 37 °C are presented in Table I to indicate their agonist or antagonist properties in hB2r-CHO cells. The data show that, like BK, the two B2 receptor agonists [Hyp3,Tyr(Me)8]BK and [Aib7]BK accelerated the dissociation of bound [3H]BK; [Aib7]BK, a strong agonist that is able to induce an increase in IP production 1.7-fold higher than the maximal response to BK, produced the same effect as BK on [3H]BK dissociation.d-Arg-[Hyp3,D-Phe7,Leu8]BK, which behaved as a partial agonist, and the B2 receptor antagonist HOE 140, which completely inhibited BK-sensitive IP production, were also able to accelerate [3H]BK dissociation. Similar results were obtained with [d-Phe7]BK, which is another B2receptor antagonist (33Hall M.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 56: 131-190Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In contrast, the B1 receptor agonists (Lys-des-Arg9-BK and des-Arg9-BK) and antagonist (des-Arg9-[Leu8]BK), which had no effect on [3H]BK binding and PLC activity, did not alter the dissociation of bound [3H]BK. These observations demonstrate that the acceleration of [3H]BK dissociation is a common feature of all BK analogues that are able to interact with the B2 receptor, whether they are agonists or antagonists.Table IIEffects of the addition of various structural BK analogues on the dissociation of bound [3H]BKAnaloguesconcCell-associated radioactivitym% of totalNone74.8 ± 3.4B2 agonists BK10−758.3 ± 1.7 [Hyp3,Tyr(Me)8]BK10−756.8 ± 2.0 [Aib7]BK10−558.5 ± 1.4B2 antagonists HOE 14010−558.2 ± 5.3 d-Arg-[Hyp3,d-Phe7,Leu8]BK10−562.5 ± 4.2 [d-Phe7]BK10−565.3 ± 2.5B1 analogues Des-Arg9-BK10−575.5 ± 4.0 Lys-des-Arg9-BK10−578.7 ± 1.7 Des-Arg9-[Leu8]BK10−577.8 ± 2.5 Open table in a new tab Experiments were performed on isolated cell membranes to test in this system the effect of BK on the dissociation kinetics and the role of guanine nucleotide. When such experiments were performed at 4 °C, [3H]BK dissociation was very slow and was not sensitive to unlabeled BK (10−7m), GTPγS (10−5m), or a combination of both. After a 5-h incubation, it represented in all cases only ∼10% of the [3H]BK specifically bound to cell membranes labeled with 2 nm [3H]BK (data not shown). However, at 25 °C, [3H]BK dissociation was increased by GTPγS as illustrated in Fig. 4. Unlabeled BK was also able to accelerate dissociation at this temperature. More important, the BK effect was observed both in the absence and presence of the guanine nucleotide. These results clearly demonstrate that guanine nucleotide is not necessary for the acceleration of BK dissociation that follows an increase in the receptor occupancy level.Figure 4Accelerated dissociation of bound [3H]BK by unlabeled BK in isolated hB2r-CHO cell membranes: effect of guanine nucleotide. Experiments were carried out at 25 °C. Cell membranes were incubated for 90 min with 2 nm [3H]BK. Then, 50-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were transferred into 5 ml of [3H]BK-free incubation medium with no addition or with unlabeled BK (100 nm), GTPγS (10 μm), or both. 3H radioactivity bound to membranes was determined at the times indicated. After substraction of nonspecific binding measured with cell membranes incubated with 2 nm[3H]BK plus 2 μm unlabeled BK, values were expressed as a percentage of the specific binding determined just before the dissociation reaction. Values are from six determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThis study provides, for the first time, evidence that the interaction between BK and the BK B2 receptor exhibits negative cooperativity. This phenomenon implies that BK binding is accompanied by a decrease in receptor affinity.The cells used in this study were CHO-K1 cells transfected with a BK B2 receptor cDNA synthesized from human kidney RNAs. A cell clone (hB2r-CHO) that expresses the receptor stably and at high density (1.3 × 106 sites/cells) was used for this study because it allowed us to analyze the ligand-receptor interaction over a wide range of ligand concentrations.Our data show that the specific [3H]BK binding to hB2r-CHO cells displays heterogeneous features in terms of binding affinity (curvilinear Scatchard plots and a Hill coefficient value less than unity) and [3H]BK dissociation rate (more than one component). Such a heterogeneity cannot be accounted for by the presence of other BK receptors in addition to the recombinant receptor. Indeed, there was no specific [3H]BK binding, no BK activation of PLC and PLA2, and no increase in cytosolic calcium upon the application of BK in the parental nontransfected CHO-K1 cells (data not shown). Also, we can exclude that the heterogeneity in the [3H]BK binding is related to the receptor internalization/recycling process, which was almost abolished at the temperature of 4 °C chosen for the experiments. This was further supported by the observation that [3H]BK binding resulted also in curvilinear Scatchard plots (data not shown) in the presence of sucrose, which inhibits endocytosis by disrupting clathrin-coated vesicles (39Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). The use of sucrose to abolish internalization was, however, not considered appropriate in the present work because besides the suppression of internalization, sucrose also markedly reduced the capacity of hB2r-CHO cells to bind BK (data not shown), as has also been reported for the binding of growth hormone to its receptor in IM-9 cells (40Ilondo M.M. Smal J. De Meyts P. Courtoy P.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1597-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, lowering the temperature to 4 °C has the advantage of preventing agonist-induced functional coupling of the receptor to cell signaling effectors and abolishing cellular enzymatic events like phosphorylation that can modify receptor structure and binding affinity (20Blaukat A. Abd Alla S. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Roberts R.A. Gullick W.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1975-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, its combination with the use of protease inhibitors prevented ligand or receptor degradation, a condition required to study the kinetics of ligand binding.The data obtained in the equilibrium binding studies support a negative cooperativity phenomenon in BK binding. However, the curvilinear Scatchard plots and the observation of a faster [3H]BK dissociation rate from cells prelabeled with high compared with low [3H]BK concentrations could also be interpreted by the finding of Leeb-Lundberg and Mathis (26Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9621-9627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the unoccupied B2 receptor can exist in various states that have different affinities for BK. By using cell membranes from bovine myometrium and incubating these membranes in the absence of guanine nucleotide, a situation that is comparable to that prevailing in our intact cells incubated at 4 °C (no functional receptor coupling to cell signaling effectors), these authors demonstrated that BK binds to at least two states of the B2 receptor, which consist of a guanine nucleotide-insensitive low affinity state (occupied at high BK concentrations only) from which BK dissociates quickly and a guanine nucleotide-sensitive high affinity state from which BK dissociates slowly. The existence of a guanine nucleotide-sensitive high affinity state of the hB2r-CHO cell B2 receptor is suggested by the fact that at low [3H]BK concentrations, equilibrium binding was less at 37 °C than at 4 °C despite the [3H]BK accumulation through the receptor internalization/recycling process that occurred at 37 °C, but not at 4 °C. This decrease in [3H]BK binding at 37 °C is probably related to a cellular GTP effect and involves a guanine nucleotide-sensitive process that is responsible for receptor and G protein coupling to cell signaling effectors and for decreases in receptor affinity like the guanine nucleotide-induced reduction in receptor affinity described by Leeb-Lundberg and Mathis (26Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9621-9627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in myometrial cell membranes. In addition, as in myometrial cell membranes (26Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9621-9627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), [3H]BK dissociation was increased by guanine nucleotide in cell membranes prepared from hB2r-CHO. However, it should be pointed out that a model in which BK interacts in a bimolecular independent fashion with two receptor states cannot entirely account for the equilibrium kinetics observed and for the time courses of BK dissociation observed in hB2r-CHO cells. Indeed, when compared with a theoretical Scatchard plot for such a model (Fig. 5), the data points occupy a rightward position in the graph, suggesting tha"

To probe the molecular basis for this phenomenon, we heterologously expressed heteromeric Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channels in Xenopusoocytes and found that they possess similar mechanosensitivity in response to hypo-osmolar stress.

Although excitation-contraction coupling is the major mechanism regulating cardiac function, mechanoelectrical feedback plays important modulatory roles (1Lab M.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Mechanoelectrical feedback is particularly essential in the atria of the heart, which regulate vascular volume through secretion of atrial natriuretic peptides when atrial myocytes are stretched. A number of mechano-sensitive ion channels have been identified in atrial tissue, including stretch-activated potassium, chloride, and nonselective cation channels (2Sigurdson W.J. Morris C.E.

Moreover, they have been characterized at the molecular level as heterotetramers of Kir3.1 (GIRK1) and Kir3.4 (GIRK4) proteins (12Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman W. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Rabbit atrial myocytes were isolated enzymatically and patch-clamped in the whole-cell recording configuration as described previously (13Mitra R. Morad M. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: H1056-H1060PubMed Google Scholar, 14Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.W. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15153) Google Scholar). Calibrated positive pressure was applied to myocytes through a water-filled U-tube connected to the patch electrode. Application of positive pressure (10 cm of H2O) did not significantly change the series resistance (6.2 ± 0.9 to 5.9 ± 0.8 megaohms, n = 9). Patch pipettes (resistance 0.2–0.5 megaohms) contained 150 mm KCl + KOH, 5 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and the bath solution contained 150 mm NaCl + NaOH, 10 mmKCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 0.02 mmtetradotoxin, 0.01 mm nifedipine, pH 7.4. The calculated potassium equilibrium potential was −65 mV. Full-length cDNA encoding the Kir3.4 protein from a rat brain library (confirmed by sequencing) was subcloned into pBlueScript (Stratagene, San Diego, CA), and cRNA was made using standardized in vitro methods (Ambion, Austin, TX). The coding region was subcloned such that the 5′ end had a Kozak sequence and the 3′ end had a poly(A) tail. Xenopus laevis oocytes were isolated by enzymatic digestion (2 mg/ml collagenase). Stage IV-V oocytes were used for injection. Current usually became detectable 24 h after injection, and experiments were carried out between 24 and 96 h afterward. Whole-oocyte currents were recorded at room temperature with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique (15Stühmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) using a Dagan (Minneapolis, MN) CA-1 oocyte clamp amplifier, a TL-1 DMA interface for data acquisition and pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate pipette glass (A-M Systems Inc., Seattle, WA) and filled with 3m KCl. Capacitance and leak currents were subtracted after blocking K+ currents with 5 mmBaCl2. The standard bath solution contained 98 mm KCl, 2 mm KOH, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 5.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. For the experiments measuring reversal potentials, KCl was replaced isotonically by NaCl. Giant cell-attached patches were formed on de-vitellinized oocytes (16Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1990; 344: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 17Shieh R.-C. John S.A. Lee J.-K. Weiss J.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 363-376Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and currents were recorded under voltage clamp conditions as described previously (17Shieh R.-C. John S.A. Lee J.-K. Weiss J.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 363-376Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The bath and pipette solutions (room temperature) contained 98 mm KCl, 2 mm KOH, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 5.0 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Currents were first recorded using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique in oocytes superfused with bath solution containing 50 mm KCl and 100 mmsucrose. Hypo-osmotic challenge (50%) was induced by removal of sucrose for 15–30 min. Leak current was subtracted after blocking K+ current with 5 mm BaCl2. Isolated rabbit atrial myocytes were patch-clamped in the whole-cell configuration, and whole-cell currents were either recorded at a steady holding potential of −100 mV (Fig.1 a) or during periodic voltage ramps from −100 to −20 mV (0.1 mV/ms) with Na+ and Ca2+ currents blocked (Fig. 1 b). After potentiating the inward potassium current by exposing the myocyte to 10 μm carbachol, 10 cm of H2O positive pressure was applied to the patch pipette to stretch the cell membrane. Positive pressure caused a rapid (within 500 msec) decrease in the carbachol-sensitive current, averaging 15 ± 3% at −100 mV in 5 myocytes (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1 d). Upon withdrawal of positive pressure, the current recovered rapidly and completely. Both before and after the application of positive pressure, current was fully blocked by 5 mm external Ba2+. Additionally, positive pressure did not induce any comparable changes in current before carbachol or in the presence of 5 mm extracellular Ba2+ (Fig. 1 c), and current-voltage relationship was not shifted, only reduced in amplitude (Fig. 1 b). These data suggest that the affected current under these conditions was predominantly I K,AChand unlikely to be due to an artifact or an endogenous mechano-sensitive current. The inactivation was rapid (within 500 ms), and the current recovered completely and similarly fast upon the removal of positive pressure after 5 s. Decreases inI K,ACh were also observed with application of as little as 2 cm of H2O positive pressure but developed more slowly and were not fully reversible. Since atrial G-protein-regulated potassium channels are known to be heteromeric proteins composed of Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 subunits (12Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman W. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), we determined whether Kir3.1/3.4 currents exhibited mechanosensitivity when heterologously coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes. To maximally activate the channels, Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 were coexpressed with an excess of Gβγ subunits (by injecting cRNA for Gβ1 and Gγ2 at a 23:1 excess), which produced a 12-fold increase in current compared with expression of Kir3.1/3.4 without Gβγ subunits (data not shown) when measured with the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. To test for mechanosensitivity, we examined the effects of reducing osmotic pressure of the bath perfusate on the amplitude of whole-oocyte Kir3.1/3.4 currents. A 50% reduction of osmotic strength of the bath solution to induce oocyte swelling and membrane stretch reversibly decreased heteromeric Kir3.1/3.4 currents measured at −100 mV by 18 ± 6% (n = 4) (Fig.2, a and b). The full decrease took about 10 min to develop, comparable to the time course of osmotic swelling documented in previous studies in oocytes (18Berntsson K.-E. Haglund B. Lovtrup S. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1964; 65: 101-112Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and was reversible over a similar time course upon restoring normal osmolarity (Fig. 2, a and b). Under both normal and hypo-osmolar conditions, the recorded currents were fully blocked by 5 mm extracellular Ba2+ (data not shown), ruling out artifact from contamination by endogenous mechanosensitive channels previously described in oocytes (19Ackerman G. Wickman K.D. Clapham D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 20Yang X.C. Sachs F. Science. 1989; 243: 1068-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In addition, noninjected oocytes showed no currents of comparable magnitude under normal or hypo-osmolar conditions (data not shown). As additional controls, we also tested the effects of hypo-osmolar challenge in oocytes expressing either Kir1.1 (ROMK1) or Kir2.1 (IRK1) channels. In neither case did the magnitude of current change in response to hypo-osmolar challenge (Fig. 2, c–e), suggesting that the cell swelling-induced inhibition of Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channels is specific to Kir3 versus other families of Kir channels. To determine which Kir3 subunit was responsible for conferring mechanosensitivity to the heteromeric channel, we attempted to express homomeric Kir3.1 or Kir3.4 channels.

Nature. 1993; 364: 802-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), expression of Kir3.1 channels with or without Gβγsubunits produced only small currents, probably representing heteromeric channels formed by Kir3.1 combining with endogenous Kir3.5 (XIR) subunits present in the oocytes (22Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Most previous studies have also reported that Kir3.4 channels form homomeric channels only poorly (11Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Velimirovic B. Wickman K. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. J. Biol.

However, by modifying the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (see “Materials and Methods”), we consistently measured large currents, typically ranging from −20 to −40 μA at −100 mV with 100 mm potassium in the bath perfusate fromXenopus oocytes expressing Kir3.4 alone, as assayed by the two-electrode voltage clamp (Fig. 3,a and b). The magnitude of the current increased linearly with the amount of cRNA injected in batches of oocytes from the same frog on the same day (Fig. 3 c). The failure of the current magnitude to saturate as well as its large magnitude compared with small endogenous currents in uninjected oocytes (−0.13 ± 0.23 μA at −100 mV, n = 8) argues strongly against the possibility that Kir3.4 proteins were combining with an endogenousXenopus protein such as Kir3.5 (XIR) (22Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) to form heteromeric channels. With 100 mm potassium in the bath solution, the large inward currents showed no or mild relaxation, and outward currents were minimal at potentials positive to the potassium equilibrium potential, typical for strong inward rectifier potassium channels (25$$Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, a and b). The current was highly selective for potassium over sodium and blocked in a voltage-dependent manner by extracellular cesium and barium, with K d values at −60 mV of 61 ± 3 μm (n = 4) and 92 ± 13 μm (n = 4) respectively (data not shown). Unitary current amplitudes at different voltages obtained from all-points histogram analysis revealed a single channel conductance of 33.2 ± 0.3 picosiemens (n = 4) with 100 mm K+ in the pipette solution (Fig.3 d), similar to an earlier estimate (12Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman W. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In contrast to the previous studies in which single channel openings were flickery and more short-lived (11Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Velimirovic B. Wickman K. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28777-28779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman W. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), openings lasting 5–50 ms were commonly observed. Like native KACh channels (26Wickman K.D. Clapham D.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), currents through homomeric Kir3.4 channels increased by an average of 76 ± 17% at −100 mV (n = 7) in response to 10 μmcarbachol when coexpressed with the m2 muscarinic receptor (Fig. 3, e and f), as has been noted previously (12Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman W. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 24Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Sui J.L. Kozak J.A. Pabon A. Ladias J.A.A. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The effect was maximal within 1–2 min and then gradually lessened, probably due to desensitization. Coexpression of Kir3.4 with Gβγ subunits (at 23:1 excess of injected Gβγ cRNA) also boosted Kir3.4 currents by an average of >100-fold compared with oocytes from the same batch injected with the same amount of Kir3.4 cRNA alone (n = 4) (Fig.3 f). These results confirm that homomeric Kir3.4 channels are also classic G-protein-regulated potassium channels. In attempting to measure unitary currents through homomeric Kir3.4 channels, we noted that channels ran down very rapidly after formation of a cell-attached patch (>50 patches). This rapid rundown precluded single channel analysis from standard patches (electrode tip, 1–3 μm) but could be quantified in giant patches (electrode tip, 20–30 μm), with the mean time constant of rundown averaging 2.3 ± 0.6 min (n = 5 giant patches). Single channel events could often be resolved when only a few active channels were left in the giant patch (Fig. 3 d). Patch excision always led to an immediate disappearance of channel activity. Since the formation of a gigaseal (or patch excision) subjects the underlying membrane to considerable mechanical forces, these observations suggested that homomeric Kir3.4 channels might be sensitive to membrane stretch. To test directly for mechanosensitivity, we examined the effects of cell swelling induced by hypo-osmotic challenge on whole-oocyte homomeric Kir3.4 currents measured with the two-electrode voltage clamp. A 50% reduction of osmotic strength of the bath solution reversibly caused a 27 ± 4% reduction in Kir3.4 current at −100 mV (n = 6) (Fig. 4). This finding indicates that the Kir3.4 subunit is responsible in part, if not exclusively, for conferring mechanosensitivity to heteromeric Kir3.1/3.4 channels and to the cardiac G-protein-regulated potassium channel. Whether the Kir3.1 subunit shares similar mechanosensitive properties is uncertain at this point. To examine the mechanism underlying the mechanosensitivity of Kir3.4 channels, we investigated whether membrane stretch inhibited Kir3.4 currents indirectly by an effect on G-protein signaling. First, we tested the effects of hypo-osmolar challenge on Kir3.4 currents that had been maximally stimulated with carbachol in oocytes coexpressing Kir3.4 and the m2 receptor. The carbachol-stimulated Kir3.4 currents demonstrated a similar decrease in response to hypo-osmolar challenge as under basal conditions (averaging 31 ± 4%,n = 4) (Fig. 4 d). We further examined the effects of hypo-osmotic challenge in oocytes in which Kir3.4 homomeric channels were coexpressed with an excess of Gβγsubunits (23:1 excess of injected Gβγ cRNA). Hypo-osmotic challenge decreased current at −100 mV by 18 ± 3% (n = 5) (Fig. 4 d). These findings show that the mechanosensitivity of Kir3.4 currents remains intact over a wide range of ambient Gβγ levels, including a presumably saturating range. This observation makes it unlikely that fluctuations in the level of Gβγ subunits induced by membrane stretch cause the inhibition of current. Our results demonstrate for the first time that KAChchannels in the atrium are mechano-sensitive, consistent with their participation in the volume-sensing role of this organ. Physiologically, stretch-induced inactivation of KAChchannels during atrial distension would facilitate membrane depolarization and enhance excitability and could potentially contribute to a variety of stretch-induced responses, including contraction-excitation coupling, atrial natriuretic peptide release, stretch-induced arrhythmias, and/or hypertrophic gene programming. By demonstrating that both heteromeric Kir3.1/3.4 channels and homomeric Kir3.4 channels exhibit similar mechanosensitivity as native rabbit atrial KACh channels, we provide the first molecular identity of a mammalian stretch-inactivated potassium channel, which will permit structure-function studies to characterize the molecular mechanisms involved. Interestingly, the predicted overall topological structure of Kir3 channels is similar to nonmammalian mechano-sensitive ion channels cloned from Escherichia coli andCaenorhabditis elegans (27Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Kung C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 633-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 28Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), suggesting a common structural motif for these mechano-sensitive ion channels. The mechanism responsible for mechanosensitivity in these channels is unclear at this point. Our findings argue against a mass action effect of stretch on Gβγ subunits as the underlying mechanism, since the mechano-sensitive response remained intact and of comparable magnitude over a wide range of ambient Gβγ levels (Fig.4 d). For the case in which oocytes were co-injected with Kir3.4 and Gβγ cRNA at a 1:23 ratio, we presume that this includes a saturating range of Gβγ subunits relative to Kir3.4 molecules, although the ratio of protein molecules cannot be assumed to be the same as the ratio of cRNA injected. Even if a mass action effect is unlikely, G-protein signaling might be involved if membrane stretch inhibited the ability of Gβγsubunits to activate the channels by an allosteric, rather than mass action, effect. By constructing chimeric proteins between Kir3.4 and non-G-protein-regulated Kir proteins, it may be possible to resolve this question. Alternatively, the mechanism of mechanosensitivity may not directly involve G-protein signaling. A recent report has demonstrated inhibition of Kir3 currents by protein kinase C (29Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is possible that membrane stretch-induced activation of phospholipase C (30Brophy C.M. Mills I. Rosales O. Isales C. Sumpio B.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Hamill O.P. McBride D.W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 231-252PubMed Google Scholar) could in turn activate protein kinase C to inhibit the channels. Finally, a direct interaction between Kir3.4 and cytoskeletal elements or direct sensitivity of the channel to membrane curvature are possible mechanisms for mechanosensitivity (32Sachs F. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1996; 52: 209-218Google Scholar). Actin has been implicated as a cytoskeletal transducer of mechanical force for other mechano-sensitive channels (33Wyszynski M. Lin J. Rao A. Nigh E. Beggs A.H. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Nature. 1997; 385: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and has been shown to regulate the function of a number of ion channels such as epithelial sodium channels (34Berdiev B.K. Prat A.G. Cantiello H.F. Ausiello D.A. Fuller C.M. Jovov B. Benos D.J. Ismailov I.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17704-17710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Also, Kir2 channels such as Kir2.1 have been shown to link to the actin cytoskeleton as a means of spatially localizing them at specific regions in the cell (35Cohen N.A. Brenman J.E. Snyder S.H. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 759-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), although no similar consensus linkage sites have been identified in Kir3 channels. These actin-binding protein sites do not confer mechanosensitivity to Kir2.1 when expressed in oocytes, however, as shown in Fig. 2 d. In preliminary experiments, we were also unable to restore Kir3.4 channel activity in excised giant inside-out patches by adding F-actin to the cytoplasmic surface of the patch. Further studies, perhaps involving chimeric constructs between Kir3.4 and other Kir family members, will be required to unravel the molecular basis for stretch-induced inactivation of these channels. We thank Dr. Henry Lester for providing the Kir3.1 and m2 receptor clones and Dr. Lutz Birnbaumer for the Gβ1 and Gγ2 clones."

In vitro biochemical studies have demonstrated that NSF, soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs), and SNAP receptors from a 20 S particle. This complex is disassembled by the ATPase activity of NSF. We have studied particle disassembly in a membrane environment by examining the binding of recombinant SNAPs and NSF to endosomal membranes. We present evidence that alpha-SNAP is released from the membranes in a temperature- and time-dependent manner and that this release is mediated by the ATPase activity of NSF. Our results indicate that NSF mutants in the first ATP binding domain completely abrogate alpha-SNAP release, whereas no inhibitory effect is observed with a mutant in the second ATP binding domain. Interestingly, neither beta-SNAP nor gamma-SNAP are released by the ATPase activity of NSF, indicating that these proteins are retained on the membranes by interactions that differ from those that retain alpha-SNAP. Although the small Rab GTPases are known to play a role in SNARE complex assembly, our results indicate that these GTPases do not regulate the NSF-dependent release of alpha-SNAP."

Bacterial conjugation is a process by which conjugative plasmid DNA is transferred in single-stranded form from a host to a recipient bacterium (for review, see Refs. 1Frost L.S. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Firth N. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 2377-2401Google Scholar). For the Escherichia coli K-12 Sex Factor F (F factor or F plasmid), most of the gene products required for conjugation are encoded within the traor transfer region, a 33-kilobase pair segment of the plasmid (1Frost L.S. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An integral step in F factor conjugation is relaxosome formation. The relaxosome is a complex composed of three different DNA-binding proteins that assemble at a specific F plasmid site. The complex nicks one plasmid DNA strand in preparation for plasmid unwinding and transfer of the nicked strand to the recipient. The name relaxosome is derived from the ability of the complex to relax the supercoiled F factor DNA via nicking (3Thompson R. Taylor L. Kelly K. Everett R. Willetts N.

In this paper, we describe the biophysical characterization of TraY as a first step in determining the structural basis for the dual activities of TraY. The traY gene was amplified by PCR 1The abbreviation used is: PCR, polymerase chain reaction. using genomic DNA from E. coli Hfr strain CAG5051 (16Singer M. Baker T.A. Schnitzler G. Deischel S.M. Goel M. Dove W. Jaacks K.J. Grossman A.D. Erickson J.W. Gross C.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 1-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides (5′-GCCGAGGTGCATATGAAAAGATTTGGTACACGTTCT-3′, complementary to the antisense strand, and 5′-CGCGAATTCCTAGAGTGTATTAAATGTTATATC-3′, complementary to the sense strand) contained NdeI and EcoRI sites, respectively, to facilitate cloning. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380C DNA synthesizer. The PCR reaction volume (100 μl) contained 500 nm of each primer, 200 μm dNTPs, and 5 units of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The PCR reaction included an initial denaturation for 4 min at 94 °C; three cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 45 s at 45 °C, and extension for 45 s at 72 °C; and then 27 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 60 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. The resulting product was digested with NdeI andEcoRI and ligated to the NdeI-EcoRI backbone fragment of pAED4 (17.Doering, D.

The identity of the cloned gene and the fidelity of PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the plasmid insert by the dideoxy termination method using T7-promoter- and T7-terminator-specific primers.

Single colonies were picked and inoculated into 5 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (LB-amp). Cultures were grown at 37 °C to anA 600 of approximately 0.5, 1 ml was transferred to another tube, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 100 μg/ml isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 2 h of additional growth, cell cultures were mixed 1:1 with loading buffer and loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide Tris-Tricine gels (20Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Induction was deemed successful by the presence of a band at the appropriate molecular weight in the induced sample. Frequently, transformants showed no TraY production upon induction, or protein expression was lost over time. Once a transformant that stably expressed TraY was identified, it was used to inoculate a 500-ml culture of LB-amp, and the culture was grown to anA 600 of 0.5. The cells were then chilled for 10 min on ice, pelleted by centrifugation (3500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 10 ml of LB-amp with 15% glycerol, and frozen in 0.5-ml aliquots. For protein purification, 500 ml of LB-amp was inoculated with 50 μl of the frozen cells, and the culture was grown to an A 600 of 0.4. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Cells were grown for 3 h post-induction and harvested by centrifugation (3500 × g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the pellets were frozen at −80 °C prior to purification. Cell pellets were thawed at 4 °C, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) plus 100 mm NaCl, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 50 μm. Cells were lysed by sonication, and the resulting solution was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 ×g. MgCl2 and DNaseI (Boehringer Mannheim) were added to the supernatant to final concentrations of 8 mmand 10 μg/ml, respectively, the solution was incubated on ice for 2 h, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a 5-ml HiTrap heparin column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl. A gradient from 100 to 1,000 mm NaCl in buffer A was applied to the column using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia), and the elution was monitored by A 280. A peak that included TraY eluted at approximately 500 mm NaCl. This peak was applied directly to a 5-ml HiTrap Blue column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer A plus 500 mm NaCl. A gradient from 500 mm to 3 m NaCl in buffer A was run over the column, with TraY eluting at approximately 2 m NaCl. The TraY peak was dialyzed extensively against buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl and concentrated to approximately 2 mg/ml using Centriprep-3 concentrators (Amicon). At this point, TraY protein was greater than 95% pure as assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein concentration was estimated by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient, calculated from the sequence, of 11,460 m−1 cm−1(21Pace C.E. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). The yield of purified TraY protein was approximately 2 mg/liter of cell culture. Amino acid analysis and 10 cycles of N-terminal sequencing of this protein prep were performed by the Biopolymers Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The mass was determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Finnigan TSQ7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer at the Harvard Microchemical facility at Harvard University. Fluorescence data were collected using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. CD spectra were obtained using an AVIV 60DS spectrapolarimeter. UV absorbance spectra were collected using a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. The buffer used for spectroscopy was 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. For urea denaturation experiments, equimolar solutions of TraY were made using 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and either 0 or 9.5 m urea. For experiments using intrinsic fluorescence, the starting solutions (2 μm TraY) were mixed in ratios to produce solutions ranging from 0 to 9.5m urea at intervals of 0.475 m. Solutions were allowed to equilibrate at ambient temperature for 30 min, transferred to a cuvette thermostated at 25 °C, and allowed to equilibrate until no change in fluorescence was observed. The fluorescence emission at 345 nm (excitation 280 nm) was averaged for 30 s, and the emission spectrum from 300 to 420 nm was also recorded. For experiments using circular dichroism, the starting solutions (5 μm TraY) with either 0 or 9.5 m urea were placed in a cuvette thermostated at 25 °C, and the urea concentration was changed incrementally by removing an aliquot from the cell and replacing it with an equal volume of the other solution. Solutions were allowed to equilibrate until no signal change was observed, and then the ellipticity at 234 nm was averaged for 30 s and recorded. Ellipticity at 234 nm rather than 222 nm was used because of the greater signal-to-noise ratio in high urea concentrations. Urea denaturation was reversible, and the data fit well to a two-state transition between native (N) and denatured (D) monomers (K u = [D]/[N]). The urea dependence of ΔG u was modeled as a linear function of urea concentration ΔG u = ΔGuH20− m × [urea], where ΔGuH20is the Gibbs free energy of unfolding in the absence of urea. Data were fit using the nonlinear curve-fitting function of Kaleidagraph 3.0 (Synergy Software). Thermal denaturation of the TraY protein was found to be irreversible. Kinetic measurements of TraY unfolding and refolding reactions were performed using an Applied Photosystems SpectraKinetic stopped-flow fluorescence instrument equipped with a 300-nm cutoff filter. Measurements were made at 25 °C in buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and different concentrations of urea. For unfolding experiments, a solution of TraY denatured in buffer plus 8m urea was mixed with solutions containing 0–2.4m urea in a 1:5 ratio to give final urea concentrations of 1.3–3.3 m. In refolding experiments, a solution of TraY in 4 m urea was mixed in a 1:5 ratio with solutions containing 7.6–10 m urea to give final urea concentrations of 7–9m. Final TraY concentrations ranged from 1 to 12 μm. At the starting and ending concentrations, the TraY population was greater than 95% native or denatured. For jumps into the refolding/unfolding transition zone, solutions of 6 μm TraY in buffer plus 4 m urea (native) or buffer plus 8 m urea (denatured) were mixed with solutions of higher or lower urea to give final concentrations of 5–6m. Kinetic data for refolding and unfolding required the use of double exponential functions to achieve good fits. Data points within the mixing dead time of the instrument (∼1 ms) were not used in the fitting procedures. Experiments were performed using a Beckman Optima XL-A centrifuge. TraY samples of 1 or 12 μm in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol were centrifuged overnight at 18,000 and 27,500 rpm, respectively. Absorbance readings were performed at 1 h intervals to determine that the samples had reached equilibrium. Absorbance profiles were obtained at 222 nm (1 μm TraY) or 280 nm (12 μm TraY), with absorbances ranging from 0.1 to 0.7. Ten scans were averaged and analyzed according to Laue et al. (22Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S. Rowe A. Horton J. Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar) to determine apparent molecular weights. A partial specific volume of 0.7407 was calculated according to Cohn and Edsall (23Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Rheinhold, New York1943Crossref Google Scholar) for use in the analysis. The gene encoding F factor TraY was amplified by PCR, cloned into an expression vector, expressed inE. coli strain BL21(DE3), and purified (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Table I, the N-terminal sequence, amino acid composition, and subunit molecular weight determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the purified protein are in excellent agreement with values predicted from the gene sequence. The purified protein was active, as judged by its ability to bind specifically and strongly (K d ∼ 1 nm) to an oligonucleotide corresponding to the recognition sequence at oriT (13Nelson W.C. Morton B.S. Lahue E.E. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (not shown). As shown in Fig.1, analytical ultracentrifugation data for TraY fit well to a monomer model but fit extremely poorly to a dimer model. These results indicate that the solution form of TraY is predominantly monomeric.Table IComposition and molecular weight of purified TraYExperimentalExpectedN-terminal sequenceMKRFGTRSATMKRFGTRSATMolecular weight15,189.015,183.2Amino acid composition1-aValues given are for number of mol/mol of TraY.

Open table in a new tab The CD spectrum of native TraY is shown in Fig.2. The strong negative ellipticity at 208, 215, and 222 nm suggests that the protein is composed of a mixture of α-helices and β-sheets. The fluorescence emission spectra of native TraY has a maximum near 345 nm as expected from a Trp residue that is largely solvent-exposed (Fig. 3). TraY contains one Trp and four Tyr residues, but the latter side chains do not contribute to fluorescence in the 320–360 range. TraY denatured in 9.5 m urea shows a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3). The minor peak at 310 nm in the spectrum of denatured TraY is due to Raman scattering of water, based on the position of the peak and shifts in this position in spectra arising from different excitation wavelengths.Figure 3Fluorescence spectra of native and denatured TraY. Spectra were taken at 25 °C using 2 μm TraY in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mm NaCl. The denatured sample also contained 9.5 m urea. Excitation was at 280 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Denaturation of TraY by urea was monitored by changes in circular dichroism ellipticity at 234 nm or fluorescence emission at 345 nm (Fig.4). From 0 to 4 m urea, the protein is largely native, and at urea concentrations above 6.5m, the protein is fully denatured. TableII lists values for the free energy of denaturation in the absence of urea ( ΔGuH20) and the change in free energy with urea (m) obtained from non-linear least squares fits of individual denaturation experiments. These values are similar for experiments monitored by CD and by fluorescence (Fig. 4, Table II), which were performed at different TraY concentrations (5 and 2 μm, respectively). This concurrence is expected if TraY denaturation is an N →D reaction without significantly populated intermediate states. A global fit of all the experimental denaturation data gave a ΔGuH20value of 6.0 (± 0.1) kcal/mol and an m value of 1.16 (± 0.02) kcal/mol·m.Table IIStability parameters for equilibrium urea denaturation of TraYTraY concentrationMethodΔG uH2OmμMkcal/molkcal/mol·m5CD5.8 ± 0.21.12 ± 0.045CD6.4 ± 0.31.23 ± 0.072Fl6.0 ± 0.51.18 ± 0.092Fl5.4 ± 0.31.07 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab Fig.5, A and B, show unfolding and refolding trajectories for TraY following jumps from 4 to 7 m urea and 8 to 3.3 m urea, respectively (final TraY concentration = 1 μm, 25 °C (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, photomultiplier tube voltage = 700 V). No change in unfolding or refolding kinetics was observed over a TraY concentration range from 1 to 12 μm. Both reactions occur over a time scale of approximately 10 s under the conditions used and require double exponential functions for an adequate fit (note residuals in Fig. 5, A and B). The kinetics of refolding were similar in pH jump experiments, indicating that the multiphasic kinetics are not unique to urea denaturation. The presence of multiple kinetic phases is consistent with the existence of intermediates in the reactions or conformational heterogenity in the native and/or denatured states. Chemical heterogeneity of TraY was not observed by electrospray mass spectrometry and thus is unlikely to account for the complex kinetic behavior. The urea dependence of the rate constants obtained from double exponential fits of the unfolding and refolding data are shown in Fig.6. Although the rate constants obtained from the fits were very reproducible, the ratio of the amplitudes of the fast and slow kinetic phases varied from a ratio of 2:1 to 1:2 for different urea concentrations or experiments. Extrapolating the unfolding data to 0 m urea gives rate constants of 0.017 and 0.0054 s−1 for the fast and slow phases. For the refolding experiments, the extrapolated rate constants are 4.9 s−1 for the fast phase and 0.23 s−1 for the slower phase. Pairing the fastest refolding rate constant with the slowest unfolding rate constant predicts a ΔG u value of 4 kcal/mol, which is lower than the value obtained in the equilibrium experiments. All other combinations of refolding and unfolding rate constants predict even lower free energies of unfolding and larger discrepancies with the equilibrium ΔG u value. The discrepancy between the kinetic and equilibrium values suggests that one or more rate constants for a faster refolding step or a slower unfolding step are not detected in the kinetic experiments. No detectable “burst” phase occurred in the refolding experiments (the observed fluorescence intensity at the earliest time was that expected for denatured TraY). It is possible, however, that fluorescence is only sensitive to late events in refolding and thus, that a faster refolding phase is present but undetectable. TraY has previously been cloned, expressed, and purified (13Nelson W.C. Morton B.S. Lahue E.E. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lahue E.E. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1385-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and some of its functional characteristics, including DNA binding, have been studied (5Nelson W.C. Howard M.T. Sherman J.A.

The structural and biophysical properties of TraY, however, have been largely unstudied. Circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence were used to probe native TraY and its denaturation by urea. The circular dichroism spectrum of native TraY suggests a mixed α-helix/β-sheet secondary structure. In equilibrium experiments, TraY denatures cooperatively in an apparent two-state, N → D fashion with aC m of 5.3 m urea and a ΔGuH20value of 6 kcal/mol. The similarity in denaturation curves monitored by CD or fluorescence indicates that changes in the environment of the single tryptophan of TraY (Trp91) and changes in TraY secondary structure occur concurrently. However, the kinetics of TraY unfolding and refolding are not consistent with simple two-state folding behavior, and it seems likely that early folding events may not be detected by changes in fluorescence. Based on a shared pattern of conserved residues, TraY has been assigned to the ribbon-helix-helix family of transcription factors (26Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 5-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), so named because family members share a common structural motif consisting of a β-ribbon or strand followed by two α-helices (27Phillips S.E.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 89-98Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This family includes the Arc and Mnt repressors from bacteriophage P22 ofSalmonella typhimurium and the MetJ repressor of E. coli. Although structural data are not yet available for TraY, its CD spectrum is consistent with a mixture of α-helix and β-sheet, as expected for a ribbon-helix-helix family member. In the structures of MetJ, Arc, and Mnt (28Rafferty J.B. Somers W.S. Saint-Girons I. Phillips S.E.V.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15036-15045Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), ribbon-helix-helix motifs from identical subunits interact, allowing the β-strands to form an antiparallel β-sheet that packs against the α-helices to form a dimeric, roughly globular, DNA-binding domain. By contrast, F factor TraY contains tandem but nonidentical ribbon-helix-helix motifs in a single polypeptide chain. This architecture could, in principle, allow monomeric folding, if the tandem TraY ribbon-helix-helix motifs interact in the same polypeptide chain, or multimeric folding, if motifs from different chains interact. Based on gel-filtration studies, Nelson et al. (13Nelson W.C. Morton B.S. Lahue E.E. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that F factor TraY is monomeric in solution. Our results confirm this finding. TraY behaves as a monomer in sedimentation equilibrium experiments, and equilibrium and kinetic denaturation and refolding are concentration-independent, as expected if folding is an intramolecular process. MetJ, Arc, Mnt, and both ribbon-helix-helix motifs of TraY have an invariant Glu residue in the second α-helix (Fig.7). In Arc, this Glu is part of an Arg-Glu-Arg salt-bridge triad. In MetJ and Mnt, the invariant Glu forms a single salt bridge. The N-terminal ribbon-helix-helix motif of TraY could form an Arg35-Glu40-Arg44salt-bridge triad identical to that found in Arc repressor. In the TraY C-terminal ribbon-helix-helix motif, this triad of residues is Trp91-Glu96-Arg100. If the overall relationship of these three residues is similar to the homologous residues in Arc, then the Nε1 group of Trp91 could donate a hydrogen bond to the Glu96 carboxylate. In this case, Trp91 would expected to be in a hydrophilic environment in native TraY, both by virtue of its proximity to Glu96 and because it would be partially solvent-exposed. This, in turn, would account for the observed fluorescence emission spectrum of TraY, which suggests that Trp91 is in a substantially hydrophilic environment. We are indebted to Ernest Frankel, Dennis Rentzeparis, and Wali Karzai for helpful discussions and to Professors Peter Kim and Jonathan King for use of equipment."
https://openalex.org/W1993766941,"Phosphatidylcholines (PCs) with branched fatty acyl chains substituted in the two positions of the main chains (branched PCs) have been shown to be potent activators of the side chain cleavage activity of cytochrome P450SCC (CYP11A1) (Schwarz, D., Kisselev, P., Wessel, R., Jueptner, O., and Schmid, R. D. (1996) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 271, 12840–12846). The present study reports on the effect of a series of branched PC on cholesterol binding, membrane integration, and protein exchange in large unilamellar vesicles prepared by an extrusion technique. Enzyme kinetics using vesicles as well as optical titration using a micelle system with the detergent Tween 20 demonstrate that activation is correlated with the fraction of P450SCC in the high spin form. The potency of branched PCs both to activate the enzyme and to induce spin state changes increases with increasing lengths of both the branched and main fatty acyl chains. We found that the extent as well as the rate of integration of P450SCC into vesicle membranes studied by gel chromatography and stopped flow kinetics were increased by branched PC. Finally, it is demonstrated by measurement of the enzymatic activity in primary and secondary vesicles that branched PCs are potent in retaining a very rapid exchange of P450SCC between vesicles, in contrast to cardiolipin, that partially inhibits this exchange process. The data suggest that different properties of P450SCC in membrane systems including cholesterol binding, membrane integration, and protein exchange are affected by branched PCs and probably by other phospholipids, too, and therefore must be considered in an explanation of the observed high stimulation of activity."
https://openalex.org/W2166845945,"In budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an ARS binding factor 1 (Abf1) binds to the sequence-specific DNA element involved in DNA replication and transcription. We describe in this study how yeast Cdc6 protein stimulates Abf1 protein DNA binding activities. The Abf1 binding activity was reduced approximately 20-fold in a cdc6-1mutant than in the wild-type strain. Introducing a copy of the wild-type CDC6 gene into the cdc6-1 mutant strain restored the Abf1 DNA binding activity. We demonstrated that recombinant Abf1 binds to ARS1 in vitro, and its DNA binding activity can be highly stimulated by the addition of a fusion glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Cdc6 protein. Deletion analysis revealed that the stimulating region is located at the amino terminus of the Cdc6 protein. However, we could not find the direct physical interaction between Cdc6 and Abf1. Instead, we found that the GST-Cdc6 can compete with distamycin A for binding to the DNA molecule. As distamycin A is a specific reagent that binds noncovalently to DNA at (A + T)-rich tracks, the stimulation of Abf1 DNA binding activity may be mediated by the Cdc6/DNA interaction. Our results favor a hypothesis that Cdc6 may function as an architectural factor in the assembly of a functional initiation replication complex.

Our results favor a hypothesis that Cdc6 may function as an architectural factor in the assembly of a functional initiation replication complex. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc6 is essential for the initiation of DNA replication. The cdc6-1 mutation fails to control the initiation of DNA replication (1Hartwell L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 803-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and has a high rate of plasmid loss. The loss of plasmid can be suppressed by increasing tandem copies of short cis-acting ARS sequences (ARS, autonomously replicatingsequences) (2Hogan E. Koshland D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3098-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), suggesting its direct role at replication origins. The nucleotide sequence of the CDC6 gene predicts a 58-kDa protein with a nucleotide binding domain and multiple potential cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) phosphorylation sites (3Zhou C. Huang S.H.

The CDC6 gene product is unstable, and its synthesis must take place during the G1 phase for the onset of S phase. The CDC6 mRNA content fluctuates periodically during the cell cycle (5Zhou C. Jong A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19904-19909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3788-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and the nuclear entry of Cdc6 protein is also cell cycle-dependent (7Jong A. Yong M. Chen G.-C. Zhang S.-Q. Chen C. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Yeast cells that exit from mitosis without de novo Cdc6 protein synthesis fail to initiate DNA replication (6Piatti S.

Origin recognition complex (ORC) 1The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; RC, replication complex; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). is a six-protein complex (Orc1–Orc6) that binds to the ARS consensus sequences (ACS) at different ARS sequencesin vivo and in vitro (8Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 9Diffley J.F.X. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested an interaction between Cdc6 and ORC. For example,CDC6 is a multicopy suppressor of the orc5-1mutation (10Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of Orc6 protein incdc6-1 cells reduces the restrictive temperature by 6 °C (11Li J.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Cdc6 interacts genetically with Orc2 in S. cerevisiae(12Loo S. Fox C.A. Rine J. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Bell S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Biochemically, Cdc6 protein synthesized in a baculovirus system associates with affinity-purified ORC (10Liang C. Weinreich M. Stillman B. Cell. 1995; 81: 667-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), indicating a direct protein-protein interaction between Cdc6 and ORC. The CDC6homologue in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, cdc18, also associates with recombinant S. pombe Orc2 (Orp2) (13Leatherwood J. Lopezgirona A. Russell P. Nature. 1996; 379: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Genomic footprinting has defined two cell cycle stages regarding the formation of replication complexes (RC): pre-RC and post-RC. The post-replicative footprint closely resembles that produced in vitro with purified ORC and Abf1, which protects A/B1 and B3 elements, respectively. The pre-replicative complexes (pre-RCs) are defined by further protecting the B2 element of ARS1 in addition to the A/B1 and B3 elements (9Diffley J.F.X. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 14Rowley A. Cocker J.H. Harwood J. Diffley J.F.X. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2631-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The Cdc6 protein is required for establishment and maintenance of pre-RC, as a premitotic arrested cdc6-1 mutant produces a post-replication footprint (15Cocker J.H. Piatti S. Santocanale C. Nasmyth K. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 1996; 379: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 16Detweiler C.S. Li J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 753-763PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the galactose-induced Cdc6 synthesis promotes the formation of pre-RC in a GAL-ubiCDC6/cdc15 yeast culture blocked with α-factor, but not in one arrested in nocodazole (17Piatti S. Bohm T. Cocker J.H. Diffley J.F.X. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1516-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), indicating that Cdc6 can only function to assemble the pre-RC during a specific time in G1. The B3 element at ARS1 sequence functions as an enhancer for replication origins and contains binding sites for anARS-binding factor 1 (Abf1) (18Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that Abf1 is required for diverse functions in regulation of DNA replication and gene expression (19Diffley J.F.X. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2120-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Rhode P.R. Sweder K.S. Oegema K.F. Campbell J.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1926-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The binding of Abf1 to the B3 site atARS1 may be required for the full origin function (18Marahrens Y. Stillman B. Science. 1992; 255: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). It is still not clear how the activity of the Abf1 protein is regulated for binding origins of replication. In this study, we report that Cdc6 protein stimulates the binding of Abf1 to ARS1. Protein extracts prepared from the cdc6-1 mutant have a low Abf1 DNA binding activity based on DNA gel mobility shift assays. The Abf1 binding activity could be restored by integrating a copy of normalCDC6 gene back into the cdc6-1 mutant cell. We demonstrate that Escherichia coli expressed Abf1 can bind toARS1 DNA fragment and that the addition of GST-Cdc6 can further enhance the Abf1 DNA binding activity. The GST-Cdc6 appears to interact with DNA and increases the affinity of Abf1 for DNA because it competes with distamycin A (a specific reagent that binds (A + T)-rich tracks noncovalently) for Abf1 DNA binding activity. The interrelationship among Cdc6, Abf1, and ARS1 and the possible physiological significance are discussed in this report. BJ2168 (a prc1-407 prb1-1122 pep4-3 leu2 trpl ura3-52) was used as CDC6wild type strain. Strain 611 (a cdc6-1, leu2, his3), kindly provided by Dr. Ray Deshire at California Institute of Technology, was derived from the temperature-sensitive (ts) mutantcdc6-1. Strain 5D611 was constructed by transformation of 611 cells with an integration plasmid pLEU-5D6 which carried theLEU2 marker gene and the wild type CDC6 gene.

Deletion probes were also constructed: probe ARS1-B3 contained a 45-bp fragment of B3 subunit of the ARS1sequence (nucleotides 745–789), while probe ARS1-AB contained a 106-bp fragment of domain A and B1 element. Whole-cell protein extracts which contain both cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were prepared from yeast cells cultured at 25 °C according to Kimmerlyet al. (21Kimmerly W. Buchman A. Kornberg R.

The 173-bp ARS1 was labeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) using a fill-in reaction with Klenow enzyme.

DNA binding reactions were conducted for 10 min at 25 °C and were than loaded immediately on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 80:1) that had been pre-run for 1 h at 25 °C in 0.5 × TBE. The gel was run for 4 h at 120 V and 25 °C, dried, and then autoradiographed. 5′-End primer 5-CTGGATCCATGGACAAATTAGTCGTG-3 and 3′-end primer 5-AAAGCTTTTGACCTCTTAATTCTGG-3 were designed for PCR amplification of the yeast ABF1 gene (20Rhode P.R. Sweder K.S. Oegema K.F. Campbell J.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1926-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The PCR products were subcloned into pBlueScript and sequenced. DNA fragment containing the yeast Abf1 coding region was then cloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen) for expression in histidine-tagged protein. Abf1 protein produced inE. coli was purified according to the manufacturer's description. pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used to construct glutathione S-transferase-Cdc6 (GST-Cdc6) expression construct and its truncated GST fusion proteins as described (Fig.2 B) (22Elsasser S. Feng L. Wang B. Campbell J.L. Jong A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1723-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel staining, and Western blot analysis were performed by using a PhastSystem (Pharmacia). We have studied the ARS1 binding activity in yeast cell extracts to determine the role of Cdc6 in controlling the initiation complex formation. ARS1 was selected as the probe because it is by far the most well characterized eukaryotic replication origin. By using the whole cell protein extracts in a DNA gel retardation assay, we observed one predominant protein-DNA complex (Fig. 1 A). This complex appeared to be a result of binding of Abf1 to the B3 element ofARS1 since it was diminished upon the addition of a 100- to 500-fold molar excess of the 45-bp fragment containing the B3 element of ARS1 (ARS1-B3) (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7–10 and lanes 15–17). In contrast, the addition of a 500-fold molar excess of the 106-bp fragment containing the entire domain A and the B1 element (ARS1-AB) was unable to compete out the binding activity (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3–6 andlanes 12–14). The specificity of this binding activity was confirmed by the formation of supershifts when an anti-Abf1 rabbit serum (20Rhode P.R. Sweder K.S. Oegema K.F. Campbell J.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1926-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was used in the gel retardation assay (data not shown). To address how Cdc6 might affect the DNA binding activity of Abf1, we analyzed the binding of Abf1 to the 173-bp ARS1 probe by using equal amounts of protein derived from the whole cell extracts prepared from the wild-type CDC6 strain BJ2168 and from thecdc6-1 mutant strain. Both extracts showed specific Abf1-DNA complexes; however, the level of the Abf1 activity in thecdc6 mutant was at least 20 times lower than that in the wild-type strain (Fig. 1 A, compare lane 2 withlane 11). The Abf1 binding activity was compared in the competition assay. As shown in Fig. 1 A, 50- to 500-fold molar excess of the ARS1-AB did not compete for binding (lanes 3–6 and lanes 12–14), yet the addition of a 50-fold molar excess of ARS1-B3 in the cdc6 extracts (lane 7) caused a ∼90% reduction of Abf1 DNA binding activity. The addition of 100- to 500-fold molar excess of the competitor resulted in less than 1% of the Abf1 activity left in cdc6 extracts (lanes 8–10). However, approximately 10–20% of the Abf1 activity could still be observed in the wild-type strain even when 100- to 500-fold molar excess of the same ARS1-B3 DNA was used in the competition (lanes 15–17). Thus, our results show that the DNA binding activity of Abf1 is significantly lower in thecdc6 mutant extracts compared with the wild-type ones. The CDC6 gene is essential for DNA replication, and the cdc6 mutant causes G1/S phase defects in the cell cycle. To address the question of whether lower Abf1 activity is due to the defective cdc6, we constructed an isogenic strain 5D611 by introducing a normalCDC6 gene into the mutant cdc6 cells. Upon yeast transformation, the wild-type CDC6 gene was integrated into the chromosomal cdc6 DNA region. The integrated wild-typeCDC6 gene rescued the temperature-sensitive cdc6cells at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) (data not shown). The Abf1 DNA binding activity was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using whole cell protein extracts prepared from the 5D611 and from the cdc6. Compared with the Abf1 activity shown in the cdc6 extracts (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2and 3), the elevated Abf1 DNA binding activity was detected in the extracts prepared from the integrated strain 5D611 (Fig.1 B, lanes 6 and 7). The protein-DNA complexes can be competed out by the addition of cold probe ARS1-B3 (lanes 4 and 8), but not by cold probe ARS1-AB (lanes 5 and 9). The results indicate that the normal Abf1 DNA binding may require functional Cdc6 at ARS1. To further determine the effect of Cdc6 on the stimulation of Abf1 activity, the DNA binding assay was performed by using whole cell protein extracts prepared from the cdc6 mutant and other cell cycle mutants such as cdc7, cdc34,cdc28, and cdc4, as well as the wild type strain BJ2168. Significantly low Abf1 activity could only be observed in the extracts prepared from the cdc6 mutant (Fig. 1 B,lanes 2–5); in contrast, the DNA binding activity was rather constant in extracts prepared from the other cdcmutant and wild-type strains (Fig. 1 B, lanes 10–19). We have used Western blots to examine the Abf1 and Cdc6 levels in these tested strains. Both protein concentrations are rather constant (data not shown), suggesting that the change of Abf1 binding activities is not due to alteration at their protein levels. Therefore, the low Abf1 DNA binding activity is specifically related to the defective cdc6 in the cdc6-1 mutant cells. To understand how Cdc6 regulates Abf1 DNA binding activity, purifiedE. coli produced Abf1 was employed in the gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 2 A). GST-Cdc6 was also prepared to test whether it could stimulate Abf1 binding to 173-bpARS1 probe. When 50 ng of purified protein was used, the protein-DNA complexes of the recombinant Abf1 and the labeledARS1 were barely detectable in our assay condition (Fig.2 A, lane 2). At lower concentrations of Abf1 (from 20 to 5 ng per reaction), the ARS1 binding activity of Abf1 was essentially undetectable (lanes 3–5). Increased Abf1 activity, however, could be achieved upon the addition of the GST-Cdc6 fusion protein into the reactions (lanes 6–8). We estimate the difference in Abf1 DNA binding between the presence and absence of GST-Cdc6 to be at least 50-fold (Fig. 2 A, comparelane 8 with lanes 2–5). Under the condition used, no DNA binding was found for the GST-Cdc6 fusion protein itself (0.5–2 ng per reaction). GST protein only, however, had no effect on the stimulation (Fig. 2 A,lanes 9–11). When 45-bp B3 DNA element which contains Abf1 consensus sequence is used as the probe, a similar stimulation can be observed (Fig. 2 A, lanes 12–17), i.e.when the B3 probe, 10 ng of Abf1, or 2 ng of GST-Cdc6 was used individually, no shifted band can be observed (Fig. 2 A,lanes 12, 13, and 14). However, the Abf1·DNA complex can be seen in the presence of 10 ng of Abf1 and 1 ng (lane 15) or 2 ng (lane 16) of GST-Cdc6. GST alone has no effect (lane 17). This effect was specific to the Cdc6 protein, since proteins such as bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, yeast histidine-tagged nucleoside diphosphate kinase, could not stimulate DNA binding (data not shown). Thus, the stimulation of Abf1 DNA binding is specific to Cdc6 protein. Truncated GST-Cdc6 fusion proteins were generated to identify a specific region responsible for the stimulation of Abf1 binding (Fig. 2 B). The following proteins were produced and analyzed: GST-NB6 (46 kDa) is that GST fused to residues 1–191 of the Cdc6 protein; GST-NP6 (33 kDa), GST fused to residues 1–47; and GST-BE6 (63 kDa), GST fused to residues 191–513. As a control, 2 ng of the GST-Cdc6 itself showed no detectable DNA binding activity (Fig.2 C, lane 2), but could stimulate the Abf1 binding activity (lane 3). The stimulation was dependent on the amount of GST-Cdc6 added (lanes 4–6). The stimulation could also be observed in GST fusion proteins GST-NB6, containing 191 amino acid residues of the amino-terminal Cdc6 (lanes 10–12), and GST-NP6, containing only the first 47 amino acid residues of the amino-terminal Cdc6 (lanes 16 and 17). However, a GST-fusion protein containing the 322-amino acid carboxyl-terminal peptide of the Cdc6 (GST-BE6) did not stimulate DNA binding (Fig.2 C, lanes 13–15). GST-NP6 exhibited a more significant stimulation. It could be because, under the same amount of protein used, the molar ratio of GST-NP6 is higher because of its smallest size. Currently, we cannot exclude the possibility that the removal of the carboxyl terminus deletes a negative regulatory element resulting in a stronger stimulation. In any case, the results suggest that the first 47-amino acid amino terminus of the Cdc6 (GST-NP6) is the major region that contains the necessary sequence for the stimulation of Abf1 DNA binding. The results of the stimulation of the Abf1 activity by GST-Cdc6 prompted us to determine how the Cdc6 promotes Abf1 DNA binding activity. The stimulation observed in the DNA gel retardation assay occurred only in the presence of the purified GST-Cdc6, Abf1, and the ARS1 probe. This suggested that Cdc6 regulates Abf1 DNA binding via direct physical interaction with the Abf1 or that the interaction of Cdc6 with DNA facilitates the Abf1-DNA binding. To test these, the CDC6gene driven by the ADH1 promoter (pADH-CDC6) was analyzed for suppression of abf-1, abf1-3, andabf1-5 temperature-sensitive strains (23Rhode P.R. Elsasser S. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), individually. None of these abf1 mutants were rescued by the plasmid pADH-CDC6 at 37 °C (data not shown), indicating that Cdc6 does not interact with Abf1 genetically in these mutants. In addition, immunoprecipitation studies could not detect any association between Cdc6 and Abf1, and Abf1 could not be retained on a GST-Cdc6 protein affinity column (data not shown). Together, these studies do not favor the possibility that the Cdc6 directly interacts with Abf1 to regulate its DNA binding activity. We therefore analyzed the possibility that the Cdc6 itself may behave like an E. coli HU-like or high mobility group protein that may interact with DNA to stimulate the binding of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Yeast ARS elements have high A + T content (>75%). To understand how Cdc6 increases Abf1 binding activity, we set up Abf1 DNA binding reactions in the presence of distamycin A, a DNA-binding reagent which recognizes (A + T)-rich tracks and associates with DNA noncovalently (24Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 451-456Google Scholar, 31Dorn A. Affolter M. Muller M. Gehring W.J. Leupin W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the absence of distamycin A, GST-Cdc6 stimulated Abf1 binding, but the GST protein alone could not (Fig. 3,lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Simultaneous incubation of distamycin A (increased from 5 to 25 μm) with GST-Cdc6 (0.5 ng), however, caused suppression of Abf1 DNA binding (lanes 6–8). No protein-DNA complex was formed by the incubation of distamycin A with the DNA probe only (lane 5) or the incubation of 25 μm distamycin A with 10 ng of Abf1 and DNA probe (lane 11). In another set of reactions, distamycin A was maintained constant at 25 μm, and the Abf1 DNA binding activity was restored along with the addition of increased amounts of GST-Cdc6 (lanes 8–10). The competition between GST-Cdc6 and distamycin A was specific since GST protein alone could not restore the Abf1 binding (lane 12). Thus, GST-Cdc6 may interact with DNA at the (A + T)-rich tracks by the removal of distamycin A from the DNA and increase the affinity for sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, Abf1, to bind DNA. Abf1 is an abundant, multifunctional protein in budding yeast. It binds to sequence-specific DNA elements involved in DNA replication and transcription. Different Abf1 gene functions may be regulated in accordance with different physiological responses during cell cycle progression. Our combined data demonstrate that Cdc6 stimulates Abf1 DNA binding to the ARS origin sequences. The comparison of the DNA binding activities of proteins derived from the wild-type strain and the cdc6-1 mutant reveals that the functional Cdc6 contributes to a higher Abf1 binding activity (Fig. 1). In our control studies, both Abf1 and Cdc6 protein levels are rather constant in wild-type and cdc6-1 mutant cells (data not shown). We could not detect direct protein-protein interaction between Abf1 and Cdc6 either. Instead we found that Cdc6 can compete with distamycin A to restore the Abf1 DNA binding activity, suggesting an interaction between the Cdc6 protein and DNA probe. If higher concentrations of Abf1 or the excess amount of GST-Cdc6 was used alone, both can induce the protein-DNA complex formation, respectively; however, the synergistic effect of Abf1 and Cdc6 on DNA binding is at least ∼20-fold more significant. In addition, the effect of the Cdc6 on Abf1 DNA binding is subtle, since the GST-Cdc6 cannot generate a distinguishable DNase I footprint pattern using ARS1 probe, and no sign of an altered Abf1 footprint could be found in the presence or absence of the Cdc6 either. 2L. Feng, B. Wang, and A. Jong, unpublished data. This discrepancy between footprinting and gel shifting results may be due to that the former techniques can only detect the sequence-specific binding through protein complex formation at defined region(s) but the latter technique can detect bent or altered structures of the DNA probes. Instead of binding to the specific nucleotide sequences, the Cdc6 protein may recognize certain DNA structures, such as (A + T)-rich tracks (Fig. 3). The (A + T)-rich tracks usually exist in many ARS sequences and in eukaryotic DNA containing palindromic sequences that are involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, recombination, or regulation of transcription. The interaction between Cdc6 and DNA may lead to an increase of Abf1 binding to the B3 element at ARS1 and otherARS DNA elements. There are many examples where nonspecific DNA-binding proteins stimulate sequence-specific binding proteins to facilitate a higher order of DNA-protein complex formation (25Grosschedi R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 26Laudet V. Stehelin D. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2493-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The DNA binding properties of Cdc6, if true, deserves further investigation. We are currently examining Cdc6 putative DNA interacting domain(s) by mutagenesis studies and structural analysis. Abf1 has different affinities for different ARS sequences. It binds tightly to ARS121, ARS120, andARS131C, and weakly to ARS1, HMRE ARS, and HMLE ARS (27Eisenberg S. Civalier C. Tye B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that, for some ARS sequences such as ARS1, the Abf1 binding to the B3 element can be transformed from low affinity to high affinity as functional Cdc6 increases during cell cycle. Recent data indicate that Abf1 functions as a physical barrier to restrict the nucleosome occupancy from invasion of domain A at the ARS1 replication origin (28Vendtti P. Costanzo G. Negri R. Camilloni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 677-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A nucleosome-free region is prerequisite for DNA replication and transcription activation. By increasing the Abf1 activity, the Cdc6 protein may determine the temporal initiation of different sets of replicative origins. Interestingly, someARS elements such as ARS307 do not contain B3 domain. It is not yet known what the role of Cdc6 is inARS307 or in the group of ARS elements without the Abf1 DNA binding site. One simple explanation is that Cdc6 may stimulate other sequence-specific DNA-binding protein(s) in theseARS elements. In fact, we have found that Cdc6 can stimulate Rap1 binding to the HMR DNA element in a similar manner (data not shown). This is consistent with the idea that the Cdc6 can bend or wrap certain DNA structures and may behave as an architectural factor inducing specific multiprotein/DNA formation. Another interesting question is whether the Cdc6 protein affects the function of Abf1 in transcription. One should keep in mind that Abf1 is an abundant protein but Cdc6 is a low copy, very unstable protein (17Piatti S. Bohm T. Cocker J.H. Diffley J.F.X. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1516-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Besides, the nuclear entry of the Cdc6 protein is cell cycle-dependent (7Jong A. Yong M. Chen G.-C. Zhang S.-Q. Chen C. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the Cdc6 regulates Abf1 throughout a complete cell cycle. However, recent studies showed that ORC, Abf1, and Rap1 are involved in both transcriptional silencing and DNA replication in the HMR and HML regions. It is still possible that the Cdc6 may be involved in Abf1 transcription regulation, but it would be in a narrow window of the cell cycle or in some particular chromosomal DNA regions. Regardless of above questions, our findings provide new important information about the Cdc6 gene function at the molecular level. Our current model is that the newly synthesized Cdc6 will be transported into nucleus in a cell cycle-dependent manner (7Jong A. Yong M. Chen G.-C. Zhang S.-Q. Chen C. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The nuclear Cdc6 could be recruited by ORC components to locate its function at specific replicative origins. One of the functions of Cdc6 could be to increase Abf1 DNA binding activity to B3 domain to facilitate the formation of some high order structural organization. This would serve to preserve specific chromatin conformation or to establish and maintain the pre-RC. The Cdc6 protein itself, together with Abf1 and/or components, are among the essential components in this high-order chromatin structure. Xenopus Cdc6 has also been shown to associate with chromatin at the very early step in DNA replication (29Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Recent data suggested that the loading of Mcm protein onto pre-replicative chromatin is Cdc6-dependent (30Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L. Diffley J.F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5611-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 32Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In the high order chromatin structure, the replication origins are triggered for DNA synthesis without interference from the nuclear scaffold or nucleosomes. Further study of interaction between Cdc6 and replication origins on chromatin should shed light on the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication. We thank Dr. Deborah L. Johnson for critical reading and excellent suggestions."
