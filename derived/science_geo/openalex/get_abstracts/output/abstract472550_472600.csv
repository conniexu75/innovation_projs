https://openalex.org/W2025690227,"Tumors are heterogeneous at the cellular level where the ability to maintain tumor growth resides in discrete cell populations. Floating sphere-forming assays are broadly used to test stem cell activity in tissues, tumors and cell lines. Spheroids are originated from a small population of cells with stem cell features able to grow in suspension culture and behaving as tumorigenic in mice. We tested the ability of eleven common breast cancer cell lines representing the major breast cancer subtypes to grow as mammospheres, measuring the ability to maintain cell viability upon serial non-adherent passage. Only MCF7, T47D, BT474, MDA-MB-436 and JIMT1 were successfully propagated as long-term mammosphere cultures, measured as the increase in the number of viable cells upon serial non-adherent passages. Other cell lines tested (SKBR3, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-435) formed cell clumps that can be disaggregated mechanically, but cell viability drops dramatically on their second passage. HCC1937 and HCC1569 cells formed typical mammospheres, although they could not be propagated as long-term mammosphere cultures. All the sphere forming lines but MDA-MB-436 express E-cadherin on their surface. Knock down of E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells abrogated its ability to grow as mammospheres, while re-expression of E-cadherin in SKBR3 cells allow them to form mammospheres. Therefore, the mammosphere assay is suitable to reveal stem like features in breast cancer cell lines that express E-cadherin."

They catalyze, inter alia, oxyfunctionalization reactions of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with remarkable regio- and stereoselectivities. When compared with cytochrome P450, APOs appear to be the choice enzymes for oxyfunctionalizations in organic synthesis due to their independence from a cellular environment and their greater chemical versatility. Here, the first two crystal structures of a heavily glycosylated fungal aromatic peroxygenase (AaeAPO) are described. They reveal different pH-dependent ligand binding modes. We model the fitting of various substrates in AaeAPO, illustrating the way the enzyme oxygenates polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Spatial restrictions by a phenylalanine pentad in the active-site environment govern substrate specificity in AaeAPO.

Capacitation is needed for the activation of motility (e.g. hyperactivation) and to prepare the sperm for an exocytotic process known as acrosome reaction. Although the HCO3−-dependent soluble adenylyl cyclase Adcy10 plays a role in motility, less is known about the source of cAMP in the sperm head. Transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs) are another possible source of cAMP. These enzymes are regulated by stimulatory heterotrimeric Gs proteins; however, the presence of Gs or tmACs in mammalian sperm has been controversial. In this study, we used Western blotting and cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation to show the Gs presence in the sperm head. Also, we showed that forskolin, a tmAC-specific activator, induces cAMP accumulation in sperm from both WT and Adcy10-null mice. This increase is blocked by the tmAC inhibitor SQ22536 but not by the Adcy10 inhibitor KH7. Although Gs immunoreactivity and tmAC activity are detected in the sperm head, PKA is only found in the tail, where Adcy10 was previously shown to reside. Consistent with an acrosomal localization, Gs reactivity is lost in acrosome-reacted sperm, and forskolin is able to increase intracellular Ca2+ and induce the acrosome reaction. Altogether, these data suggest that cAMP pathways are compartmentalized in sperm, with Gs and tmAC in the head and Adcy10 and PKA in the flagellum.

Freshly ejaculated mammalian sperm are not competent for fertilization. They acquire fertilizing capacity during their transit through the female tract in a process known as capacitation. This process includes the preparation for a physiologically induced acrosome reaction and for changes in the sperm motility pattern known as hyperactivation (1Visconti P.E.

Although the molecular basis of this process is not completely understood, it has been shown that different aspects of capacitation are regulated by the second messenger cAMP (reviewed in Refs. 2Bailey J.L.

At least part of cAMP's actions is mediated through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). As demonstrated by McKnight and co-workers (4Morgan D.J. Weisenhaus M. Shum S. Su T. Zheng R. Zhang C.

In vertebrates, cAMP is synthesized by two types of adenylyl cyclases as follows: a ubiquitous family of transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs) 4The abbreviations used are: tmACtransmembrane adenylyl cyclaseFKforskolinANOVAanalysis of varianceAdcysoluble adenylyl cyclasesZPsolubilized ZPGpp(NH)pguanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphateIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthinePNApeanut agglutininEPACexchange proteins activated by cAMP. with nine members (Adcy1–9) and soluble adenylyl cyclase encoded by a single gene (Adcy10 also known as SACY or sAC), which is alternatively spliced into multiple isoforms (6Buck J.

Adcy10 was originally thought to be restricted to testis and sperm (9Braun T. Dods R.F. Development of a Mn2+-sensitive, “soluble” adenylate cyclase in rat testis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In the one genetic study demonstrating a role for a tmAC in male fertility using Adcy3 null mice, it was unclear whether Adcy3 played a role in mature sperm or whether it contributed to fertility during spermatogenesis (17Livera G.

Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1277-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One defining property of tmACs is that they are regulated by members of the heterotrimeric G protein family. These complexes are composed of three subunits (α, β, and γ), each of which belongs to different subfamilies. Transmembrane ACs are positively modulated by either of two stimulatory α subunits (αs and αolf) and negatively regulated by any of three inhibitory α subunits (αi1, αi2, and αi3). Both stimulatory and inhibitory α subunits can be post-translationally modified by bacterial toxins. This modification can be followed in vitro using NAD(32P) as substrate. Whereas all Gαi subunits are ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin, Gαs and αolf can be modified by cholera toxin (29Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. G proteins.Trends Biochem.

Experimental evidence from two independent laboratories (i.e. the Kopf and Garbers laboratories) conclusively demonstrated the presence of Gαi in mouse sperm (32Bentley J.K. Garbers D.L. Domino S.E.

However, similar to the situation with tmACs, the presence of stimulatory Gαs in mammalian sperm has been controversial with conflicting reports for (34Baxendale R.W. Fraser L.R.

We now provide evidence that tmACs are present in mouse sperm by demonstrating that cAMP is generated in response to forskolin in sperm from Adcy10-null mice. In addition, we show that sperm contain a cholera toxin ADP-ribosylated substrate that can be immunoprecipitated with anti-Gαs antibodies. Our results also indicate compartmentalization of those molecules involved in the cAMP pathway, whereas Gαs was localized to the anterior head, the PKA catalytic subunit was only found in the sperm flagellum. Interestingly, forskolin increased intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and induced the acrosome reaction in sperm incubated in conditions that support capacitation.

Cholera toxin was purchased from List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (Campbell, CA). The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, [adenylate-32P] ([32P]NAD) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

This medium does not support capacitation unless supplemented with bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml BSA, fatty acid-free) and NaHCO3 (15 mm). After 10 min, the sperm suspension was washed by addition of 1 ml of noncapacitating media and centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Sperm were then resuspended (final concentration: 2 × 107 cells/ml) and diluted 10 times in the appropriate medium depending on the experiment performed. In experiments where capacitation was investigated, 5 mg/ml BSA and 15 mm NaHCO3 were added, and sperm were incubated at 37 °C for at least 1 h. The preparation of sperm and brain fractions was carried out as described previously (36Visconti P.E. Johnson L.R. Oyaski M. Fornés M. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Regulation, localization, and anchoring of protein kinase A subunits during mouse sperm capacitation.Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse sperm (2 × 108 cells) or brains were homogenized using 10 strokes with a Teflon Dounce homogenizer in TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science), as indicated by the manufacturer, plus 0.4 mm leupeptin, 0.4 mm aprotinin, 0.1 mm pepstatin, 0.3 m benzamidine, and 0.32 mg/ml calpains I and II inhibitor). After homogenization, the sample was sonicated three times for 15 s on ice with 1-min intervals. Cell debris was pelleted (1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Again, the resultant pellet was saved, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The final pellet, which contained the membrane fraction, was resuspended in sample buffer and used for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. ADP-ribosylation was performed essentially as described (33Kopf G.S. Woolkalis M.J. Gerton G.L. Evidence for a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein in invertebrate and mammalian sperm.

Briefly, cholera toxin was activated at a concentration of 2 mg/ml by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C in media containing 100 mm DTT, 10 mg/ml BSA, 1% SDS, and 200 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Cholera toxin assays contained 20 μg of either sperm or brain membrane protein, 6 mm ATP, 0.6 mm Gpp(NH)p, 30 mm MgCl2, 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm DTT, 60 mm thymidine, 6 mg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, 0.3 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.3 mg/ml leupeptin, 6 mm p-aminobenzamidine, and 5 × 104 cpm/pmol [32P]NAD+ in a final volume of 30 μl. Reactions were carried out for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 333 μg/ml activated cholera toxin and were stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. Autoradiography was carried out using Kodak Biomax MS film (Rochester, NY) for 12 h up to 3 days at −80 °C. After the [32P]ADP-ribosylation assay, the solution was boiled in Tris saline buffer containing 1% SDS (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS) for 5 min and then diluted 10 times with SDS-free Tris saline buffer. Samples were then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with an anti-Gαs polyclonal antibody or with normal rabbit serum at a final concentration of 0.01 mg/ml. After this period, protein G-Sepharose beads were added (10% v/v) and further incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After incubation, beads were washed with Triton X-100/PBS by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 45 s. Samples were then washed three times with PBS and finally boiled for 5 min in sample buffer. After centrifugation, eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and autoradiographed. Then the same membranes were used for Western blotting with 1 μg/ml anti-Gαs antibodies. Chemiluminescence could be detected in less than 5 min. At this time, the radioactivity from the 32P was negligible. After incubation under different experimental conditions, sperm were collected by centrifugation, washed in 1 ml of PBS, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, 5% β-mercaptoethanol was added to supernatants, and the mixture was boiled again for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 8–10% mini-gels; protein extracts equivalent to 1–2 × 106 sperm were loaded per lane. In experiments using brain membrane extracts, 10 μg per lane were used. Each gel contained dual-prestained molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic transfer of proteins to Immobilon (Bio-Rad) and immunodetection of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were carried out using Tyr(P) monoclonal antibodies as described previously (37Kalab P. Visconti P. Leclerc P. Kopf G.S. p95, the major phosphotyrosine-containing protein in mouse spermatozoa, is a hexokinase with unique properties.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3810-3817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Gαs antibody was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and anti-pPKA substrate monoclonal antibody at 30 ng/ml. Immunoblots were developed with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and ECL chemiluminescence reagents. When needed, PVDF membranes were stripped at 60 °C for 15 min in 2% SDS, 0.74% β-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.5, and washed six times for 5 min in T-TBS. Soluble zona pellucida (sZP) was prepared from homogenized ovaries of virgin female 60-day-old outbreed CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories), and solubilized as outlined previously (38De La Vega-Beltran J.L.

The sperm suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min under capacitating conditions. Acrosome reaction was induced after capacitation in a 50-μl aliquot by adding either different forskolin concentrations or calcium ionophore A23187 (15 μm final concentration) in the presence or absence of SQ22536. After further incubation of 30 min at 37 °C, sperm were fixed with 5% formaldehyde in PBS, then mounted on glass slides, and air-dried. Slides were stained with 0.22% Coomassie Blue G-250 in 50% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid for 5 min, rinsed, and mounted with 50% (v/v) glycerol in PBS (38De La Vega-Beltran J.L.

At least 100 sperm were assayed per experimental condition to calculate the percentage of acrosome reaction. Sperm obtained by the swim-up method in WH medium were washed once, resuspended in PBS (1–2 × 105 sperm/ml), and seeded on 8-well glass slides. After being air-dried, sperm were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS (four washes at 5 min each), and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Following permeabilization, sperm were treated with 10% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with either the respective primary antibody (1:200) diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA or with the same concentration of the corresponding affinity-purified IgG; incubations were carried out at 4 °C overnight. After incubation, sperm were washed thoroughly with PBS and incubated with the corresponding Alexa 555-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200) diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature; these solutions also contained Alexa 488-conjugated peanut agglutinin (PNA) (1:100) for acrosomal staining. Incubation with the secondary antibody was followed by four washes in PBS, and slides were mounted using Slow-Fade Light reagents (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Epifluorescence microscopy was performed using a TE300 Eclipse microscope (×60) (Nikon). Differential interference contrast images were taken in parallel and served as control for sperm morphology. Negative controls using either normal serum or secondary antibody alone were used to check for antibody specificity. PKA activity was measured as described (36Visconti P.E. Johnson L.R. Oyaski M. Fornés M. Moss S.B. Gerton G.L. Kopf G.S. Regulation, localization, and anchoring of protein kinase A subunits during mouse sperm capacitation.Dev.

To obtain the Triton-insoluble suspension, sperm (108 cells) obtained in Whitten's HEPES buffered as described above were centrifuged and resuspended in Triton buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100). Suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and saved for PKA activity assays. For determination of PKA activity, 10 μl of the Triton-insoluble sperm suspension was mixed with 10 μl of the same buffer containing known or unknown amounts of cAMP and kept on ice for no more than 30 min. The PKA enzymatic assay was started by adding 10 μl of 3× assay mixture so that the final concentration of the assay components was 100 μm Kemptide, [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) (2 × 106 cpm/assay), 100 μm ATP, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm IBMX, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science).

https://openalex.org/W2062739811,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) have emerged as two effective clinical targets for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present study, we found that delphinidin, an anthocyanidin, present in pigmented fruits and vegetables, is a potent inhibitor of both EGFR and VEGFR2 in NSCLC cells that overexpress EGFR/VEGFR2. Using these cells, we next determined the effects of delphinidin on cell growth and apoptosis in vitro and on tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. Delphinidin (5-60 µM) treatment of NSCLC cells inhibited the activation of PI3K, and phosphorylation of AKT and MAPKs. Additionally, treatment of NSCLC cells with delphinidin resulted in inhibition of cell growth without having significant toxic effects on normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Specifically, treatment of NCI-H441 and SK-MES-1 cells with delphindin (5-60 µM) resulted in (i) cleavage of PARP protein, (ii) activation of caspase-3 and -9, (iii) downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1), (iv) upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bak), and (v) decreased expression of PCNA and cyclin D1. Furthermore, in athymic nude mice subcutaneously implanted with human NSCLC cells, delphinidin treatment caused a (i) significant inhibition of tumor growth, (ii) decrease in the expression of markers for cell proliferation (Ki67 and PCNA) and angiogenesis (CD31 and VEGF), and (iii) induction of apoptosis, when compared with control mice. Based on these observations, we suggest that delphinidin, alone or as an adjuvant to current therapies, could be used for the management of NSCLC, especially those that overexpress EGFR and VEGFR2."

In this study, we examined the mechanism by which tPA initiates cell signaling in PC12 and N2a neuron-like cells. We demonstrate that enzymatically active and inactive tPA (EI-tPA) activate ERK1/2 in a biphasic manner. Rapid ERK1/2 activation is dependent on LDL receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1). In the second phase, ERK1/2 is activated by tPA independently of LRP1. The length of the LRP1-dependent phase varied inversely with the tPA concentration. Rapid ERK1/2 activation in response to EI-tPA and activated α2-macroglobulin (α2M*) required the NMDA receptor and Trk receptors, which assemble with LRP1 into a single pathway. Assembly of this signaling system may have been facilitated by the bifunctional adapter protein, PSD-95, which associated with LRP1 selectively in cells treated with EI-tPA or α2M*. Myelin-associated glycoprotein binds to LRP1 with high affinity but failed to induce phosphorylation of TrkA or ERK1/2. Instead, myelin-associated glycoprotein recruited p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) into a complex with LRP1 and activated RhoA. p75NTR was not recruited by other LRP1 ligands, including EI-tPA and α2M*. Lactoferrin functioned as an LRP1 signaling antagonist, inhibiting Trk receptor phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation in response to EI-tPA.

https://openalex.org/W2157547677,"A major challenge in bioethanol fermentation is the low tolerance of the microbial host towards the end product bioethanol. Here we report to improve the ethanol tolerance of E. coli from the transcriptional level by engineering its global transcription factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP), which is known to regulate over 400 genes in E. coli. Three ethanol tolerant CRP mutants (E1- E3) were identified from error-prone PCR libraries. The best ethanol-tolerant strain E2 (M59T) had the growth rate of 0.08 h(-1) in 62 g/L ethanol, higher than that of the control at 0.06 h(-1). The M59T mutation was then integrated into the genome to create variant iE2. When exposed to 150 g/l ethanol, the survival of iE2 after 15 min was about 12%, while that of BW25113 was <0.01%. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis (RT-PCR) on 444 CRP-regulated genes using OpenArray® technology revealed that 203 genes were differentially expressed in iE2 in the absence of ethanol, whereas 92 displayed differential expression when facing ethanol stress. These genes belong to various functional groups, including central intermediary metabolism (aceE, acnA, sdhD, sucA), iron ion transport (entH, entD, fecA, fecB), and general stress response (osmY, rpoS). Six up-regulated and twelve down-regulated common genes were found in both iE2 and E2 under ethanol stress, whereas over one hundred common genes showed differential expression in the absence of ethanol. Based on the RT-PCR results, entA, marA or bhsA was knocked out in iE2 and the resulting strains became more sensitive towards ethanol."
https://openalex.org/W2041158885,"Sediments are widely accepted as a threat to coral reefs but our understanding of their ecological impacts is limited. Evidence has suggested that benthic sediments bound within the epilithic algal matrix (EAM) suppress reef fish herbivory, a key ecological process maintaining reef resilience. An experimental combination of caging and sediment addition treatments were used to investigate the effects of sediment pulses on herbivory and EAMs and to determine whether sediment addition could trigger a positive-feedback loop, leading to deep, sediment-rich turfs. A 1-week pulsed sediment addition resulted in rapid increases in algal turf length with effects comparable to those seen in herbivore exclusion cages. Contrary to the hypothesised positive-feedback mechanism, benthic sediment loads returned to natural levels within 3 weeks, however, the EAM turfs remained almost 60% longer for at least 3 months. While reduced herbivore density is widely understood to be a major threat to reefs, we show that acute disturbances to reef sediments elicit similar ecological responses in the EAM. With reefs increasingly threatened by both reductions in herbivore biomass and altered sediment fluxes, the development of longer turfs may become more common on coral reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2075915129,"The climatic cycles of the Quaternary, during which global mean annual temperatures have regularly changed by 5-10°C, provide a special opportunity for studying the rate, magnitude, and effects of geographic responses to changing climates. During the Quaternary, high- and mid-latitude species were extirpated from regions that were covered by ice or otherwise became unsuitable, persisting in refugial retreats where the environment was compatible with their tolerances. In this study we combine modern geographic range data, phylogeny, Pleistocene paleoclimatic models, and isotopic records of changes in global mean annual temperature, to produce a temporally continuous model of geographic changes in potential habitat for 59 species of North American turtles over the past 320 Ka (three full glacial-interglacial cycles). These paleophylogeographic models indicate the areas where past climates were compatible with the modern ranges of the species and serve as hypotheses for how their geographic ranges would have changed in response to Quaternary climate cycles. We test these hypotheses against physiological, genetic, taxonomic and fossil evidence, and we then use them to measure the effects of Quaternary climate cycles on species distributions. Patterns of range expansion, contraction, and fragmentation in the models are strongly congruent with (i) phylogeographic differentiation; (ii) morphological variation; (iii) physiological tolerances; and (iv) intraspecific genetic variability. Modern species with significant interspecific differentiation have geographic ranges that strongly fluctuated and repeatedly fragmented throughout the Quaternary. Modern species with low genetic diversity have geographic distributions that were highly variable and at times exceedingly small in the past. Our results reveal the potential for paleophylogeographic models to (i) reconstruct past geographic range modifications, (ii) identify geographic processes that result in genetic bottlenecks; and (iii) predict threats due to anthropogenic climate change in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2087744465,"The orexigenic peptide, ghrelin is known to influence function of GnRH neurons, however, the direct effects of the hormone upon these neurons have not been explored, yet. The present study was undertaken to reveal expression of growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) in GnRH neurons and elucidate the mechanisms of ghrelin actions upon them. Ca(2+)-imaging revealed a ghrelin-triggered increase of the Ca(2+)-content in GT1-7 neurons kept in a steroid-free medium, which was abolished by GHS-R-antagonist JMV2959 (10 µM) suggesting direct action of ghrelin. Estradiol (1nM) eliminated the ghrelin-evoked rise of Ca(2+)-content, indicating the estradiol dependency of the process. Expression of GHS-R mRNA was then confirmed in GnRH-GFP neurons of transgenic mice by single cell RT-PCR. Firing rate and burst frequency of GnRH-GFP neurons were lower in metestrous than proestrous mice. Ghrelin (40 nM-4 μM) administration resulted in a decreased firing rate and burst frequency of GnRH neurons in metestrous, but not in proestrous mice. Ghrelin also decreased the firing rate of GnRH neurons in males. The ghrelin-evoked alterations of the firing parameters were prevented by JMV2959, supporting the receptor-specific actions of ghrelin on GnRH neurons. In metestrous mice, ghrelin decreased the frequency of GABAergic mPSCs in GnRH neurons. Effects of ghrelin were abolished by the cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1) antagonist AM251 (1µM) and the intracellularly applied DAG-lipase inhibitor THL (10 µM), indicating the involvement of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. These findings demonstrate that ghrelin exerts direct regulatory effects on GnRH neurons via GHS-R, and modulates the firing of GnRH neurons in an ovarian-cycle and endocannabinoid dependent manner."

Heterologous expression of whiB7 genes showed these resistance profiles reflected the host's repertoire of endogenous whiB7-dependent genes. Transcriptional activation of two resistance genes in the whiB7 regulon, tap (a multidrug transporter) and erm(37) (a ribosomal methyltransferase), required interaction of WhiB7 with their promoters. Furthermore, heterologous expression of tap genes isolated from Mycobacterium species demonstrated that divergencies in drug specificity of homologous structural proteins contribute to the variation of WhiB7-dependent drug resistance. WhiB7 has a specific tryptophan/glycine-rich region and four conserved cysteine residues; it also has a peptide sequence (AT-hook) at its C terminus that binds AT-rich DNA sequence motifs upstream of the promoters it activates.

In addition to drug resistance, Wbl genes have roles in morphogenesis, cell division, virulence, and both primary and secondary metabolism. Two members of the family, whiB and whiD, were first identified in Streptomyces coelicolor where they play essential roles in sporulation. Wbl proteins contain around 100 amino acids. They are characterized by four conserved cysteine residues (18Soliveri J.A. Gomez J. Bishai W.R. Chater K.F.

Here, we show that WhiB7-mediated multidrug resistance spectra in Streptomyces lividans (closely related to S. coelicolor having an identical whiB7 sequence), M. smegmatis, and R. jostii are dependent on genome-specific resistance determinants and that WhiB7 activity requires the consensus sequence motifs of the Wbl protein family as well as its distinctive AT-hook DNA binding domain. In addition, the Streptomyces WhiB7 protein was, for the first time, anaerobically purified as dimers that coordinated a fully reduced, oxygen-sensitive Fe-S cluster.

Several drugs with immune-suppressive properties modulate MKP-1 expression as part of their mechanism of action. We investigated the effect of mTOR inhibition through rapamycin and a dual mTOR inhibitor (AZD2014) on MKP-1 expression. Low dose rapamycin led to a rapid activation of both AKT and ERK pathways with a subsequent increase in MKP-1 expression. Rapamycin treatment led to phosphorylation of CREB, transcription factor 1 (ATF1), and ATF2, three transcription factors that bind to the cyclic AMP-responsive elements on the Mkp-1 promoter. Inhibition of either the MEK/ERK or the AKT pathway attenuated rapamycin-mediated MKP-1 induction. AZD2014 did not activate AKT but activated the ERK pathway, leading to a moderate MKP-1 induction. Using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) derived from wild-type (WT) mice or mice deficient in AKT1 and AKT2 isoforms or BMDM from targeted deficiency in MEK1 and MEK2, we show that rapamycin treatment led to an increased MKP1 expression in BMDM from WT but failed to do so in BMDMs lacking the AKT1 isoform or MEK1 and MEK2. Importantly, rapamycin pretreatment inhibited LPS-mediated p38 activation and decreased nitric oxide and IL-6 production.

Perturbations in these pathways have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Here we present a comprehensive kinetic model of the complex network of human tryptophan metabolism based upon existing kinetic data for all enzymatic conversions and transporters. By integrating tissue-specific expression data, modeling tryptophan metabolism in liver and brain returned intermediate metabolite concentrations in the physiological range. Sensitivity and metabolic control analyses identified expected key enzymes to govern fluxes in the branches of the network. Combining tissue-specific models revealed a considerable impact of the kynurenine pathway in liver on the concentrations of neuroactive derivatives in the brain. Moreover, using expression data from a cancer study predicted metabolite changes that resembled the experimental observations. We conclude that the combination of the kinetic model with expression data represents a powerful diagnostic tool to predict alterations in tryptophan metabolism. The model is readily scalable to include more tissues, thereby enabling assessment of organismal tryptophan metabolism in health and disease.

Mediator lipidomics revealed a series of novel oxygenated metabolites of 17,18-EpETE, and one of the major metabolites, 12-hydroxy-17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-OH-17,18-EpETE), displayed a potent anti-inflammatory action by limiting neutrophil infiltration in murine zymosan-induced peritonitis. 12-OH-17,18-EpETE inhibited leukotriene B4-induced neutrophil chemotaxis and polarization in vitro in a low nanomolar range (EC50 0.6 nM). The complete structures of two natural isomers were assigned as 12S-OH-17R,18S-EpETE and 12S-OH-17S,18R-EpETE, using chemically synthesized stereoisomers. These natural isomers displayed potent anti-inflammatory action, whereas the unnatural stereoisomers were essentially devoid of activity. These results demonstrate that 17,18-EpETE derived from dietary EPA is converted to a potent bioactive metabolite 12-OH-17,18-EpETE, which may generate an endogenous anti-inflammatory metabolic pathway."

Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) was found monomethylated on its lysine 88 residue (IFITM3-K88me1) to reduce its antiviral activity, mediated by the lysine methyltransferase SET7. Vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus infection increased IFITM3-K88me1 levels by promoting the interaction between IFITM3 and SET7, suggesting that this pathway could be hijacked to support infection; conversely, IFN-α reduced IFITM3-K88me1 levels. These findings may have important implications in the design of therapeutics targeting protein methylation against infectious diseases.

https://openalex.org/W1993740812,"Endurance, marathon-type exertion is known to induce adverse changes in the immune system. Increased airway hyper-responsiveness and airway inflammation are well documented in endurance athletes and endurance exercise is considered a major risk factor for asthma in elite athletes. Yet, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still to be deduced. We studied the effect of strenuous endurance exercise (marathon and half-ironman triathlon) on CD4+ lymphocyte sub-populations and on the balance between effector and regulatory CD4+ lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of trained athletes, Endurance exercise induced a significant increase in Th17 cells and a sustained decrease in peripheral blood regulatory T cells (Tregs). While interleukin (IL)-2 levels remained undetectable, post-race serum IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF) β levels were significantly elevated. Treg levels in sedentary controls' decreased in vitro after incubation with athletes' post-exercise serum, an effect that was attenuated by supplements of IL-2 or anti IL-6 neutralizing antibodies. Our data suggest that exercise-induced changes in serum cytokine levels promote alterations in Tregs and Th17 cell populations, which may divert the subtle balance in the immune system towards inflammation. This may explain allergic and autoimmune phenomena previously reported in endurance athletes and contribute to our understanding of exercise-related asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1969005911,"Inflammatory immune responses play an important role in mucosal homeostasis and gut diseases. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), central to the proinflammatory cascade, is activated in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a devastating condition of intestinal injury with extensive inflammation in premature infants. TGF-β is a strong immune suppressor and a factor in breast milk, which has been shown to be protective against NEC. In an NEC animal model, oral administration of the isoform TGF-β1 activated the downstream effector Smad2 in intestine and significantly reduced NEC incidence. In addition, TGF-β1 suppressed NF-κB activation, maintained levels of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα in the intestinal epithelium, and systemically decreased serum levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ. The immature human fetal intestinal epithelial cell line H4 was used as a reductionistic model of the immature enterocyte to investigate mechanism. TGF-β1 pretreatment inhibited the TNF-α-induced IκBα phosphorylation that targets the IκBα protein for degradation and inhibited NF-κB activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated decreased NF-κB binding to the promoters of IL-6, IL-8, and IκBα in response to TNF-α with TGF-β1 pretreatment. These TGF-β1 effects appear to be mediated through the canonical Smad pathway as silencing of the TGF-β central mediator Smad4 resulted in loss of the TGF-β1 effects. Thus, TGF-β1 is capable of eliciting anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-κB specifically in the intestinal epithelium as well as by decreasing systemic IL-6 and IFN-γ levels. Oral administration of TGF-β1 therefore can potentially be used to protect against gastrointestinal diseases."

Hundreds of millions of compounds lie in targeted in silico libraries waiting for their metabolic potential to be discovered.

The Phase I and II metabolizing enzymes provide a critical first line of defense against the chemical insults of xenobiotics (1Evans W.E. Relling M.V. Pharmacogenomics. Translating functional genomics into rational therapeutics.Science. 1999; 286: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (2128) Google Scholar). Considerable effort has gone into the development and testing of in silico models that predict the binding and catalytic properties of these enzymes (2van de Waterbeemd H. Gifford E. ADMET in silico modelling. Towards prediction paradise?.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 192-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). The cytochrome P-450 isozymes that catalyze the oxidative reactions of Phase I metabolism are of particular interest because they are estimated to metabolize ∼85% of drugs (1Evans W.E. Relling M.V.

Here, experimental data and recent insights into the molecular basis of SULT substrate selectivity were used to develop and benchmark in silico models that can predict the binding and reactivity of two SULTs: 1A1 and 2A1. These two SULT isoforms are each present in near gram quantities in a typical adult liver (where they comprise ∼80% of SULTs by mass) (11Riches Z. Stanley E.L. Bloomer J.C. Coughtrie M.W.

Both models proved to be 100% accurate in identifying substrates, and neither made false predictions using a ligand affinity threshold of 100 μm. Together, the models identified 98 SULT substrates in the drug library, 23 of which are identified here for the first time. These hyperaccurate models are expected to provide valuable tools for the in silico exploration of sulfur metabolism.

The fusion protein was eluted with imidazole (10 mm) onto a glutathione-Sepharose column and then eluted using GSH (10 mm). The fusion protein was digested with Precision Protease and dialyzed overnight against HEPES/K+ (50 mm, pH 7.5), DTT (1.5 mm), KCl (50 mm) at 4 °C. The sample was passed back through the glutathione column to remove the tag. SULT1A1 was concentrated using a 10-kDa cutoff filter and stored at −80 °C in 40% glycerol. Protein purity was assessed at >97% using SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ280 = 36.7 mm−1 cm−1) (16Zhang H. Varlamova O. Vargas F.M. Falany C.N. Leyh T.S.

The charge was neutralized with Na+, and NaCl was added to the solvent for a concentration of 0.15 m. “Steepest descents” in GROMACS was used to energy minimize the system (23Van Gunsteren W. Berendsen H. A leap-frog algorithm for stochastic dynamics.Mol. Simulation. 1988; 1: 173-185Crossref Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Once minimized, the protein-solvent system was heated to a simulated temperature of 310 K, and the system was stabilized using Berendsen temperature and pressure coupling (24Berendsen H. Postma J. DiNola A. Haak J. Molecular dynamics with coupling to an external bath.J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23462) Google Scholar). Bonds were constrained with LINCS (25Hess B.

The simulation was equilibrated and run for 10 ns. A model of the enzyme was then generated from the simulations using the g_cluster function in GROMACS (26Xavier D. Karl G. Bernhard J.

The screens described in this study used the DrugBank Approved Drug Library 3.0. This library contains the 1,455 small molecules (≤1,000 Da) that are approved for therapeutic use in any country and includes the complete list of FDA-approved small molecule over the counter (390 drugs) and prescription (821 drugs) drugs listed in the 31st edition of the Orange Book (27Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations. 31st Ed.

Compounds in the DrugBank list that had no literature link to sulfation and were predicted to be substrates by the SULT1A1 and 2A1 models were purchased from the Enzo drug library (28Weger B.D. Weger M. Nusser M. Brenner-Weiss G. Dickmeis T. A chemical screening system for glucocorticoid stress hormone signaling in an intact vertebrate.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and tested as substrates under following conditions: SULT (0.10 μm dimer), substrate (10 μm), Me2SO (≤0.1%), 35S-PAPS (3.0 μm, 0.69 Ci/mmol), MgCl2 (5.0 mm), KPO4 (50 mm), pH 7.5, and T = 25 ± 2 °C. The reactions were initiated by the addition of PAPS. The final reaction volume was 30 μl. The reactions were quenched after 16 h with 0.10 m NaOH and then neutralized with HCl. Tubes containing the samples were placed in a boiling water bath for 1 min before centrifuging at 12,100 relative centrifugal force for 5 min. The samples were spotted onto a reverse phase TLC plate and reactants were separated using the following running buffer: methylene chloride, methanol, water, and ammonium hydroxide (90, 16, 3.5 and 0.50% by volume, respectively). Radiolabeled products were visualized and quantitated using a STORM imaging system. To assess whether thioguanine binds and inhibits SULT1A1, it was tested as an inhibitor of the SULT1A1 catalyzed sulfation of PnP. Sulfation was monitored at 415 nm (ϵ* = 10.6 mm−1 cm−1, pH 7.5 (29Whittemore R.M. Pearce L.B. Roth J.A. Purification and kinetic characterization of a dopamine-sulfating form of phenol sulfotransferase from human brain.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2477-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)). The reaction conditions were as follows: SULT1A1 (50 nm), PnP (1.5 μm, 1 × Km), inhibitor (0, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, and 1,500 μm), PAPS (100 μm), MgCl2 (5.0 mm), KPO4 (50 mm), pH 7.5, 25 ± 2 °C. Reactions were initiated by addition of PAPS. Reaction rates were determined during conversion of the first 5% of PnP. Ki values were obtained by fitting the rate versus [inhibitor] data to a single-site binding model (15Cook I. Wang T. Falany C.N. Leyh T.S. A nucleotide-gated molecular pore selects sulfotransferase substrates.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5674-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by mixing a solution containing SULT1A1 (30 μm, 83.5 × Km PAPS), MgCl2 (5.0 mm), KPO4 (50 mm), pH = 7.5 with an equal volume of a solution containing thioguanine, 35S-PAPS (3.0 μm, SA 0.69 Ci/mmol), MgCl2 (5.0 mm), KPO4 (50 mm), pH = 7.5. The concentration of thioguanine was selected, based on its Ki, value to saturate the enzyme. Reactions were run for 2.0 min, and quenched by addition of NaOH to a final concentration of 0.10 mm and then neutralized with HCl. Eppendorf tubes containing the reaction mixtures were heated in a boiling water bath for 1 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 relative centrifugal force. Radiolabeled reactants were separated on anion exchange TLC plates using a 0.90 m LiCl mobile phase and quantitated using STORM imaging. Controls were identical except that acceptor was not added. Inhibition was assessed in a classical initial rate study using a progress curve strategy (30Tang Q. Leyh T.S. Precise, facile initial rate measurements.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2010; 114: 16131-16136Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this approach, the inhibitor concentration is fixed, and the concentration of the substrate is continuously monitored from to to the end point of the reaction. Progress curves are collected at four inhibitor concentrations that range from 0.2 − 5 × Ki. The velocity at each point in the curve is given by the slope of the tangent at that point. Slopes taken over a sufficiently small concentration range (≤5% of remaining substrate) provide initial rates. Thousands of initial rate measurements can be calculated from a properly executed and analyzed progress curve, and the data can be plotted and analyzed in the familiar Lineweaver-Burke, double-reciprocal format. Reaction conditions were as follows: SULT1A1 or 2A1 (50 nm), PnP (3.0 or 100 μm, respectively; 2 × Km PnP), amoxipine or protriptyline (0, 50, 100, or 300 μm), PAPS (125 μm or 3.0 mm, respectively; >250 × Km PAPS), MgCl2 (5.0 mm), KPO4 (50 mm), pH 7.5, 25 ± 2 °C. Sulfation of PnP was monitored optically at λ = 415 nm (ϵ415 = 10.6 mm−1 cm−1 at pH 7.5 (29Whittemore R.M. Pearce L.B. Roth J.A.

The affinities of PAPS and PAP for 1A1 are comparable; hence, product inhibition by nucleotide was minimized by selecting a PnP concentration that converts ≤2.4% of PAPS to PAP at the reaction endpoints. At the end point, the concentration of PnP sulfate is 400-fold lower than its Ki (1.2 mm (31Tyapochkin E. Cook P.F. Chen G. Isotope exchange at equilibrium indicates a steady state ordered kinetic mechanism for human sulfotransferase.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11894-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)); hence, PNP sulfate inhibition should also be negligible. The progress curve was analyzed using methods described in previous work (30Tang Q. Leyh T.S. Precise, facile initial rate measurements.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2010; 114: 16131-16136Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, an initial rate is calculated at each point in the progress curve by taking the slope over an interval that is centered on the point and represents 1% of the remaining absorbance. The velocities and concentrations are plotted in double reciprocal space and fit globally to the competitive binding algebra using the Cleland statistical analysis algorithm (32Cleland W.W. Statistical analysis of enzyme kinetic data.Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar) modified to accept large data sets (30Tang Q. Leyh T.S. Precise, facile initial rate measurements.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2010; 114: 16131-16136Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). SULTs contain a conserved ∼30-residue active site cap that restructures in response to substrates and mediates their interactions. The cap plays a pivotal role in substrate selection. In the open state, the cap allows active site access to a broad range of acceptor structures. When it closes, it forms a pore that sterically sieves acceptors from its environment, admitting only acceptors small enough to pass through and the active site. Greater than 95% of the ligand-free enzyme is in the cap-open form (15Cook I. Wang T. Falany C.N. Leyh T.S. A nucleotide-gated molecular pore selects sulfotransferase substrates.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5674-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Cook I. Wang T. Almo S.C. Kim J. Falany C.N.

In contrast, the binding of nucleotide causes the majority of the enzyme to shift into the closed state; the isomerization equilibrium constant, Kiso, for the nucleotide-bound complex is ∼24 in favor of the closed form. A consequence of this isomerization is that the affinities of substrates that are too large to pass through the pore are weakened by bound nucleotide by a factor that is nearly equal to Kiso (i.e., Kd (+nuc) = (1 + Kiso) · Kd (−nuc) (15Cook I. Wang T. Falany C.N. Leyh T.S. A nucleotide-gated molecular pore selects sulfotransferase substrates.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5674-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)). In liver cytosol, where PAPS concentration (∼80 μm (34Klaassen C.D. Boles J.W. Sulfation and sulfotransferases 5. The importance of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) in the regulation of sulfation.FASEB J. 1997; 11: 404-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)) greatly exceeds its affinity constant (∼0.3 μm (15Cook I. Wang T. Falany C.N. Leyh T.S. A nucleotide-gated molecular pore selects sulfotransferase substrates.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5674-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)), SULTs 1A1 and 2A1are expected to be largely in the closed form. The dimensions of the pore define whether substrates are “large” or “small,” and the large/small bias of the enzyme selection is determined by the value of Kiso. Given these facts, it is clear that comprehensive modeling of SULT binding and reactivity requires inclusion of both the open and closed forms. Each of the FDA-approved small molecule drugs in the DrugBank database was docked into rigid structures of the open and closed forms of SULT1A1 and 2A1 using GOLD, the Genetically Optimized Ligand Docking program (35Verdonk M.L. Berdini V. Hartshorn M.J. Mooij W.T. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Watson P. Virtual screening using protein-ligand docking. Avoiding artificial enrichment.J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2004; 44: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The protein structures used in the docking were obtained by analyzing the ensemble of structures predicted to occur at thermal equilibrium using GROMACS. The ensemble was binned into clusters whose all protein atom root mean square deviations vary by no more than 2 Å. The centroid of the largest cluster in an ensemble, the structure that differs least from all other members in the set, was used in the docking experiments. Centroids of the closed forms were generated from crystal structures of nucleotide-bound enzyme. Open form centroids were derived from their closed form counterparts by removing the nucleotide and re-equilibrating (see “Experimental Procedures”). This procedure is known to convert the closed into the open form (17Cook I. Wang T. Almo S.C. Kim J. Falany C.N. Leyh T.S. The gate that governs sulfotransferase selectivity.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the case of SULT2A1, the open centroid closely resembles the structure of the unliganded enzyme (17Cook I. Wang T. Almo S.C. Kim J. Falany C.N. Leyh T.S. The gate that governs sulfotransferase selectivity.Biochemistry. 2013; 52: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). There are no other unliganded SULT structures. GOLD morphs ligands in the active site cavity by swapping bond angle and position parameters of two randomly configured versions of the same molecule located within a sphere centered on the active site. Swapping occurs with a preset “cross-over” frequency. Changes that are not possible via swapping are allowed to occur with a preset “mutational” frequency. Parents and siblings from a given “cross” are scored on the basis of stearics and energetics, and the top scoring half is used in the subsequent cross. This cycle is repeated 2,500 times or until the program converges on a single, most stable ligand configuration. The convergence routine is repeated 10 times for each ligand-enzyme combination, and the most stable result is used for subsequent analysis. The discovery that a compound is a SULT substrate will likely be physiologically relevant only if the Kd or Km of the substrate is comparable to or less than its in vivo concentration. The in vivo concentration is the concentration (or activity) of free ligand in the near environment of an enzyme in a particular local in the organism; for example, in the hepatocyte cytosol. In practice, these values are rarely known. Km is often taken as an approximation of in vivo substrate concentration (36Benner S.A. Enzyme kinetics and molecular evolution.Chem. Rev. 1989; 89: 789-806Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This assumption is based on the concept that enzyme affinities have evolved to optimize catalysts to respond to changes in metabolite levels. The affinities of SULT substrates that bind only the open form of the enzyme are weaker than those that can bind both o"

Methods We measured parameters related to obesity and dental decay in 8,275 4th and 5th grade Kuwaiti children (average age = 11.36 years) in a cross-sectional study. First to determine body weight, height, age for computation of BMI . Second, to determine numbers of teeth, numbers of fillings and numbers of untreated decayed teeth to determine extent and severity of dental disease. From these measurements, we computed measures of dental decay in children from four body weight categories; obese, overweight, normal healthy weight and underweight children. Results The percentage of children with decayed or filled teeth varied inversely with the body weight category. The percentage of decayed or filled teeth decreased from 15.61% (n=193) in underweight children, to 13.03% (n=4,094) in normal healthy weight children, to 9.73% (n=1,786) in overweight children to 7.87% (n=2,202) in obese children. Differences between all groups were statistically significant. Male children in this population had more dental decay than female children but the reduction of tooth decay as a function of BMI was greater in male children. Conclusions The finding of an inverse obesity-dental decay relationship contradicts the obesity-sugar and the obesity-dental decay relationship hypotheses. Sugar is well recognized as necessary and sufficient for dental decay. Sugar is also hypothesized to be a leading co-factor in obesity. If the later hypothesis is true, one would expect dental decay to increase with obesity. This was not found. The reasons for this inverse relationship are not currently clear."
https://openalex.org/W1987605477,"The organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP/Oatp) superfamily includes a group of polyspecific transporters that mediate transport of large amphipathic, mostly anionic molecules across cell membranes of eukaryotes. OATPs/Oatps are involved in the disposition and elimination of numerous physiological and foreign compounds. However, in non-mammalian species, the functional properties of Oatps remain unknown. We aimed to elucidate the role of Oatp1d1 in zebrafish to gain insights into the functional and structural evolution of the OATP1/Oatp1 superfamily. We show that diversification of the OATP1/Oatp1 family occurs after the emergence of jawed fish and that the OATP1A/Oatp1a and OATP1B/Oatp1b subfamilies appeared at the root of tetrapods. The Oatp1d subfamily emerged in teleosts and is absent in tetrapods. The zebrafish Oatp1d1 is similar to mammalian OATP1A/Oatp1a and OATP1B/Oatp1b members, with the main physiological role in transport and balance of steroid hormones. Oatp1d1 activity is dependent upon pH gradient, which could indicate bicarbonate exchange as a mode of transport. Our analysis of evolutionary conservation and structural properties revealed that (i) His-79 in intracellular loop 3 is conserved within OATP1/Oatp1 family and is crucial for the transport activity; (ii) N-glycosylation impacts membrane targeting and is conserved within the OATP1/Oatp1 family with Asn-122, Asn-133, Asn-499, and Asn-512 residues involved; (iii) the evolutionarily conserved cholesterol recognition interaction amino acid consensus motif is important for membrane localization; and (iv) Oatp1d1 is present in dimeric and possibly oligomeric form in the cell membrane. In conclusion, we describe the first detailed characterization of a new Oatp transporter in zebrafish, offering important insights into the functional evolution of the OATP1/Oatp1 family and the physiological role of Oatp1d1."

Physicians' clinical practice in sepsis care and patient mortality rate for severe sepsis were analyzed using a nationally representative cohort.Hospitalizations for severe sepsis with organ failure from 1997 to 2008 were extracted from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), and trends in sepsis incidence and mortality rates were analyzed. A before-and-after study design was used to evaluate changes in the utilization rates of SSC items and changes in severe sepsis mortality rates occurred after a national education program conducted by the Joint Taiwan Critical Care Medicine Committee since 2004. A total of 39,706 hospitalizations were analyzed, which consisted of a pre-intervention cohort of 14,848 individuals (2000-2003) and a post-intervention cohort of 24,858 individuals (2005-2008).The incidence rate of severe sepsis increased from 1.88 per 1,000 individuals in 1997 to 5.07 per 1,000 individuals in 2008. The cumulative mortality rate decreased slightly from 48.2% for the pre-intervention cohort to 45.9% for the post-intervention cohort. The utilization rates of almost all SSC items changed significantly between the pre-intervention and post-intervention cohorts. These changes of utilization rates were found to be associated with mild reduction in mortality rate.The nationwide education program through a national professional society has a significant impact on physicians' clinical practice and resulted in a slight but significant reduction of severe sepsis mortality rate."
https://openalex.org/W2047854832,"Extracellular accumulation of toxic concentrations of glutamate (Glu) is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, often accompanied by hypoxia and impaired metabolism of this neuromediator. To address the question whether the multifunctional neuroprotective action of erythropoietin (EPO) extends to the regulation of extracellular Glu-level and is age-related, young and culture-aged rat astroglial primary cells (APC) were simultaneously treated with 1mM Glu and/or human recombinant EPO under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (NC and HC). EPO increased the Glu uptake by astrocytes under both NC and especially upon HC in culture-aged APC (by 60%). Moreover, treatment with EPO up-regulated the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS), the expression of glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) and the level of EPO mRNA. EPO alleviated the Glu- and hypoxia-induced LDH release from astrocytes. These protective EPO effects were concentration-dependent and they were strongly intensified with age in culture. More than a 4-fold increase in apoptosis and a 2-fold decrease in GS enzyme activity was observed in APC transfected with EPO receptor (EPOR)-siRNA. Our in vivo data show decreased expression of EPO and a strong increase of EPOR in brain homogenates of APP/PS1 mice and their wild type controls during aging. Comparison of APP/PS1 and age-matched WT control mice revealed a stronger expression of EPOR but a weaker one of EPO in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model mice. Here we show for the first time the direct correlation between the extent of differentiation (age) of astrocytes and the efficacy of EPO in balancing extracellular glutamate clearance and metabolism in an in-vitro model of hypoxia and Glu-induced astroglial injury. The clinical relevance of EPO and EPOR as markers of brain cells vulnerability during aging and neurodegeneration is evidenced by remarkable changes in their expression levels in a transgenic model of AD and their WT controls."

In this work, the acetate tolerance of E. coli was much improved by rewiring its global regulator cAMP receptor protein (CRP), which is reported to regulate 444 genes. Error-prone PCR method was employed to modify crp and the mutagenesis libraries (~3×106) were subjected to M9 minimal medium supplemented with 5–10 g/L sodium acetate for selection. Mutant A2 (D138Y) was isolated and its growth rate in 15 g/L sodium acetate was found to be 0.083 h-1, much higher than that of the control (0.016 h-1). Real-time PCR analysis via OpenArray® system revealed that over 400 CRP-regulated genes were differentially expressed in A2 with or without acetate stress, including those involved in the TCA cycle, phosphotransferase system, etc. Eight genes were chosen for overexpression and the overexpression of uxaB was found to lead to E. coli acetate sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2134898546,"Over the past decades, professional boundaries in health care have come under pressure, and the expansion of prescriptive authority to include nurses touches on issues of professional domains and interprofessional competition. Knowledge claims play an important role in achieving jurisdictional control. Knowledge can take on multiple forms, ranging from indeterminate to technical (I/T ratio) and from everyday to exclusive knowledge. To investigate the interrelatedness of jurisdiction, knowledge claims and professional status, we examine which knowledge claims were made by the medical and nursing professions in the Netherlands to secure or obtain, respectively, jurisdictional control over prescribing, and which form this knowledge took. The study is based on thirteen semi-structured stakeholder interviews and an extensive document analysis. We found that the nursing profession in its knowledge claims strongly emphasized the technicality and everyday knowledge character of the prescribing task, by asserting that nurses were already prescribing medicines, albeit on an illegal basis. Their second claim focused on the indeterminate knowledge skills of nurses and stated that nurse prescribing would do justice to nurses’ skills and expertise. This is a strong claim in a quest for (higher) professional status. Results showed that the medical profession initially proclaimed that prescribing should be reserved for doctors as it is a task requiring medical knowledge, i.e. indeterminate knowledge. Gradually, however, the medical profession adjusted its claims and tried to reduce nurse prescribing to a task almost exclusively based on technicality knowledge, among others by stating that nurses could prescribe in routine cases, which would generate little professional status. By investigating the form that professional knowledge claims took, this study was able to show the interconnectedness of jurisdictional control, knowledge claims and professional status. Knowledge claims are not mere rhetoric, but actively influence the everyday realities of professional status, interprofessional competition and jurisdictional division between professions."
https://openalex.org/W2154291996,"3-Hydroxybenzoate 6-hydroxylase (3HB6H) from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 is an NADH-specific flavoprotein monooxygenase that catalyzes the para-hydroxylation of 3-hydroxybenzoate (3HB) to form 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate (2,5-DHB). Based on results from stopped-flow spectrophotometry, the reduced enzyme-3HB complex reacts with oxygen to form a C4a-peroxy flavin with a rate constant of 1.13 ± 0.01 × 10(6) m(-1) s(-1) (pH 8.0, 4 °C). This intermediate is subsequently protonated to form a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin with a rate constant of 96 ± 3 s(-1). This step shows a solvent kinetic isotope effect of 1.7. Based on rapid-quench measurements, the hydroxylation occurs with a rate constant of 36 ± 2 s(-1). 3HB6H does not exhibit substrate inhibition on the flavin oxidation step, a common characteristic found in most ortho-hydroxylation enzymes. The apparent kcat at saturating concentrations of 3HB, NADH, and oxygen is 6.49 ± 0.02 s(-1). Pre-steady state and steady-state kinetic data were used to construct the catalytic cycle of the reaction. The data indicate that the steps of product release (11.7 s(-1)) and hydroxylation (36 ± 2 s(-1)) partially control the overall turnover."

Herpesvirus-DNA and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells were sampled from 58 recipients with herpesvirus-associated diseases or with unexplainable CNS manifestations. Results showed that 23 patients were diagnosed as herpesvirus-associated CNS diseases, including 15 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated diseases (4 encephalitis and 11 lymphoproliferative diseases), 5 herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis, 2 cytomegalovirus encephalitis/myelitis and 1 varicella zoster virus encephalitis. The median time of diseases onset was 65 (range 22-542) days post-transplantation. The 3-year cumulative incidence of herpesvirus-associated encephalitis/myelitis and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) was 6.3% ±1.9% and 4.1% ±1.2%, respectively. Of the evaluable cases, CSF cells mainly consisted of CD19+CD20+ B cells (7/11) and had clonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes (3/11) in patients with CNS-PTLD. On the contrary, in patients with encephalitis/myelitis, CSF cells were comprised of different cell populations and none of the gene rearrangement was detected. Herpesvirus-associated CNS diseases are common in the early stages of allo-HSCT, wherein EBV is the most frequent causative virus. The immunophenotypic and clonal analysis of CSF cells might be helpful in the differential diagnosis between encephalitis and lymphoproliferative diseases."

We obtain super-resolution images by using stochastic intensity fluctuations of biological probes, combining Photoactivation Light-Microscopy (PALM)/Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) methodologies. We compared different image analysis algorithms for processing super-resolution data to identify the most suitable for analysis of particular cell structures. SOFI was chosen for X and Y and was able to achieve a resolution of ca. 80 nm; however higher resolution was possible >30 nm, dependant on the super-resolution image analysis algorithm used. Our method uses low laser power and fluorescent probes which are available either commercially or through the scientific community, and therefore it is gentle enough for biological imaging. Through comparative studies with structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and widefield epifluorescence imaging we identified that our methodology was advantageous for imaging cellular structures which are not immediately at the cell-substrate interface, which include the nuclear architecture and mitochondria. We have shown that it was possible to obtain two coloured images, which highlights the potential this technique has for high-content screening, imaging of multiple epitopes and live cell imaging."

Phytoplankton tows were collected from two sites at intervals over two years and subsampled for morphology-based surveys (2010, 2011), a culture-based DNA reference library (DRL; 2010), and a molecular-based survey (2011). The DRL and molecular-based survey utilized the 3′ end of the RUBISCO large subunit (rbcL-3P) to identify genetic species groups (based on 0.1% divergence in rbcL-3P), which were subsequently identified morphologically to allow comparisons to the morphology-based survey. Comparisons were compiled for the year (2011) by site (n = 2) and by season (n = 3). Of the 34 taxa included in the comparisons, 50% of taxa were common to both methods, 35% were unique to the molecular-based survey, and 12% were unique to the morphology-based survey, while the remaining 3% of taxa were unidentified genetic species groups. The morphology-based survey excelled at identifying rare taxa in individual tow subsamples, which were occasionally missed with the molecular approach used here, while the molecular methods (the DRL and molecular-based survey), uncovered nine cryptic species pairs and four previously overlooked species. The last mentioned were typically difficult to identify and were generically assigned to Thalassiosira spp. during the morphology-based survey. Therefore, for now we suggest a combined approach encompassing routine morphology-based surveys accompanied by periodic molecular-based surveys to monitor for cryptic and difficult to identify taxa. As sequencing technologies improve, molecular-based surveys should become routine, leading to a more accurate representation of species composition and richness in monitoring programs."

The EWS/Fli-1 fusion gene, a product of the translocation t(11;22) (q24; 12), is detected in 95% of ES patients. Recently, it was validated that cells emit a heterogeneous mixture of vesicular, organelle-like structures (microvesicles, MVs) into their surroundings including blood and body fluids, and that these MVs contain a selected set of tumor-related proteins and high levels of mRNAs and miRNAs. In this present study, we detected the Ewing sarcoma-specific EWS/Fli-1 mRNA in MVs from the culture medium of ES cell lines carrying t(11;22) (q24; 12). Also, we detected this fusion gene in approximately 40% of the blood samples from mice inoculated with xenografts of TC135 or A673 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2033773166,"The functional unit of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters consists of two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). ATP binding elicits association of the two NBDs, forming a dimer in a head-to-tail arrangement, with two nucleotides ""sandwiched"" at the dimer interface. Each of the two nucleotide-binding sites is formed by residues from the two NBDs. We recently found that the prototypical NBD MJ0796 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii dimerizes in response to ATP binding and dissociates completely following ATP hydrolysis. However, it is still unknown whether dissociation of NBD dimers follows ATP hydrolysis at one or both nucleotide-binding sites. Here, we used luminescence resonance energy transfer to study heterodimers formed by one active (donor-labeled) and one catalytically defective (acceptor-labeled) NBD. Rapid mixing experiments in a stop-flow chamber showed that NBD heterodimers with one functional and one inactive site dissociated at a rate indistinguishable from that of dimers with two hydrolysis-competent sites. Comparison of the rates of NBD dimer dissociation and ATP hydrolysis indicated that dissociation followed hydrolysis of one ATP. We conclude that ATP hydrolysis at one nucleotide-binding site drives NBD dimer dissociation."

This study was designed to assess whether supplementing casein with an amino acid mixture composed of arginine, glycine, taurine and lysine, matching their respective levels in cod protein, may account for the anti-inflammatory effect of cod protein. Male Wistar rats were fed isoenergetic diets containing either casein, cod protein, or casein supplemented with L-arginine (0.45%), glycine (0.43%), L-taurine (0.17%) and L-lysine (0.44%) (casein+). After 21 days of ad libitum feeding, one tibialis anterior muscle was injured with 200 µl bupivacaine while the saline-injected contra-lateral tibialis anterior was served as sham. Cod protein and casein+ similarly modulated the inflammation as they decreased COX-2 level at day 2 post-injury (cod protein, p=0.014; casein+, p=0.029) and ED1(+) macrophage density at days 2 (cod protein, p=0.012; casein+, p<0.0001), 5 (cod protein, p=0.001; casein+, p<0.0001) and 14 (cod protein, p<0.0001; casein+, p<0.0001) post-injury, and increased ED2(+) macrophage density at days 5 (cod protein, p<0.0001; casein+, p=0.006), 14 (cod protein, p=0.001; casein+, p<0.002) and 28 (cod protein, p<0.009; casein+, p<0.005) post-injury compared with casein. Furthermore, cod protein up-regulated (p=0.037) whereas casein+ tended to up-regulate (p=0.062) myogenin expression at day 5 post-injury compared with casein. In the cod protein-fed group, these changes resulted in greater muscle mass at days 14 (p=0.002), and 28 (p=0.001) post-injury and larger myofiber cross-sectional area at day 28 post-injury compared with casein (p=0.012). No such effects were observed with casein+. These data indicate that anti-inflammatory actions of cod protein, contrary to its effect on muscle mass recovery, are driven by its high levels of arginine, glycine, taurine and lysine."

ROP18 is secreted into the host cell during the invasion process, and its catalytic activity is required for the acute virulence phenotype. However, its precise molecular function and regulation are not fully understood. We have determined the crystal structure of the ROP18 kinase domain, which is inconsistent with a previously proposed autoinhibitory mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, a sucrose molecule bound to our structure identifies an additional ligand-binding pocket outside of the active site cleft. Mutational analysis confirms an important role for this pocket in virulence. At least a third of the human population is infected with the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which contributes significantly to the disease burden in immunocompromised and neutropenic hosts and causes serious congenital complications when vertically transmitted to the fetus. Genetic analyses have identified the Toxoplasma ROP18 Ser/Thr protein kinase as a major factor mediating acute virulence in mice. ROP18 is secreted into the host cell during the invasion process, and its catalytic activity is required for the acute virulence phenotype. However, its precise molecular function and regulation are not fully understood. We have determined the crystal structure of the ROP18 kinase domain, which is inconsistent with a previously proposed autoinhibitory mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, a sucrose molecule bound to our structure identifies an additional ligand-binding pocket outside of the active site cleft. Mutational analysis confirms an important role for this pocket in virulence. Toxoplasma gondii is a highly prevalent protozoan intracellular parasite that is estimated to have infected a third of the human population. The organism can cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals, as well as those suffering from AIDS and hematopoietic malignancies (1Dubey J.P. Jones J.L.

Primary infection of women during pregnancy with vertical transmission to the fetus can result in a wide range of birth defects. Studies in mice have demonstrated a critical role for neutrophils during the early immune response to T. gondii infection in limiting the parasite burden and lethality (6Bliss S.K. Gavrilescu L.C. Alcaraz A. Denkers E.Y. Neutrophil depletion during Toxoplasma gondii infection leads to impaired immunity and lethal systemic pathology.Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 4898-4905Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and this has serious implications for patients with defective neutrophil-mediated killing of pathogens. In North America and Europe, the majority of T. gondii isolates from patients can be grouped into three major clonal lineages, which show dramatic differences in virulence in mice (7Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Population structure of Toxoplasma gondii. Clonal expansion driven by infrequent recombination and selective sweeps.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 62: 329-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Type I strains are acutely virulent with inoculations of single parasites being lethal in mice (LD100 ∼1), whereas type II strains show intermediate virulence (LD50 ∼103 parasites) and type III strains are relatively avirulent (LD50 ≥104 parasites). To identify genetic loci underlying the differences in virulence between these strains, pairwise crosses between these strains have been conducted, in which the F1 progeny were genotyped and scored for their virulence in mice. In one study, a single locus, corresponding to the ROP18 gene, was identified and accounted for >90% of the difference in virulence between type I and type III strains (8Taylor S. Barragan A. Su C.

The ROP18 gene was also one of five virulence-associated loci identified in a type II × type III cross (9Saeij J.P. Boyle J.P. Coller S. Taylor S. Sibley L.D. Brooke-Powell E.T. Ajioka J.W. Boothroyd J.C. Polymorphic secreted kinases are key virulence factors in toxoplasmosis.Science. 2006; 314: 1780-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Type III strains show a 10,000-fold lower level of the ROP18 mRNA transcript relative to the other two strains and are effectively ROP18 null at the level of protein expression. This is likely due to a 2.1-kb region within the promoter region of the type III ROP18 allele that is not present in the type I or II alleles (9Saeij J.P. Boyle J.P. Coller S. Taylor S. Sibley L.D.

Many members of the ROPK family are catalytically inactive pseudokinases lacking key active site residues as exemplified by the prototypic member, ROP2 (13Peixoto L. Chen F. Harb O.S. Davis P.H.

Attachment of T. gondii to a host cell triggers the secretion of multiple proteins from specialized organelles (micronemes, rhoptries, and dense granules) at the apical end of the parasite (15Boothroyd J.C. Dubremetz J.F. Kiss and spit. The dual roles of Toxoplasma rhoptries.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 16Dubey J.P. Lindsay D.S. Speer C.A. Structures of Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites, bradyzoites, and sporozoites and biology and development of tissue cysts.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 267-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is followed by active entry into the host cell and enclosure of the parasite within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV). The PV provides a protective environment for parasite growth and replication inside the host cell. Upon secretion, a number of the rhoptry proteins, including ROP18, localize to the host cytosolic face of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM), where they are well positioned to play important yet poorly understood roles at the host-pathogen interface that affect virulence determinants such as parasite growth and survival (14El Hajj H.

The recent identification of the interferon γ (IFNγ) inducible immunity-related p47 GTPases (IRGs) as substrates of ROP18 has provided some mechanistic insights into the molecular functions of one such rhoptry-secreted virulence factor (17Fentress S.J.

IFNγ induction of the IRG family of proteins is an important component of the early innate immune response in mice against intracellular pathogens such as T. gondii. A major host resistance mechanism contributing to the clearance of the avirulent strains of T. gondii within IFNγ-stimulated host cells involves the sequential loading of multiple IRG proteins at the PVM shortly after infection. The accumulation of IRG proteins at the PVM results in the rupture of the PV and release of the parasites into the host cytosol, where they are destroyed (19Howard J.C. Hunn J.P. Steinfeldt T.

Virulent type I strains avoid destruction by inhibiting IRG accumulation on the PVM and are thus able to aggressively expand within the host. ROP18 was recently shown to directly phosphorylate IRG proteins to impair their accumulation on the PVM (17Fentress S.J. Behnke M.S. Dunay I.R. Mashayekhi M. Rommereim L.M. Fox B.A. Bzik D.J.

Phosphorylation of mouse immunity-related GTPase (IRG) resistance proteins is an evasion strategy for virulent Toxoplasma gondii.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000576Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Given that the IRG resistance system is absent in host species such as humans and cats (19Howard J.C. Hunn J.P. Steinfeldt T. The IRG protein-based resistance mechanism in mice and its relation to virulence in Toxoplasma gondii.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2011; 14: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), other types of host defense mechanisms likely exist that may be compromised by ROP18 and other virulence factors. One such mechanism involves the host transcription factor ATF6β, which up-regulates multiple genes in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. ATF6β-deficient mice showed increased sensitivity to infection by avirulent ROP18-deficient parasites, and ROP18 was recently reported to phosphorylate ATF6β leading to its proteasome-dependent degradation (24Yamamoto M. Ma J.S. Mueller C. Kamiyama N. Saiga H. Kubo E. Kimura T. Okamoto T. Okuyama M. Kayama H. Nagamune K. Takashima S. Matsuura Y. Soldati-Favre D. Takeda K. ATF6beta is a host cellular target of the Toxoplasma gondii virulence factor ROP18.J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To further our understanding of ROP18 regulation and function, we have solved the crystal structure of its kinase domain and identified features important for virulence in mice. Our structure is the first determined for a catalytically active rhoptry kinase and builds on data from previously published crystal structures of the pseudokinase domains of ROP2 (PDB accession codes 2W1Z and 3DZO), ROP8 (PDB code 3BYV), and ROP5 (PDB code 3Q60) (25Labesse G.

Chem. 2011; 286: 29366-29375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Unlike ROP18, all three of these ROPK proteins do not function by phosphorylating downstream targets. Our structure of the ROP18 kinase domain disproves a previously proposed autoinhibitory mechanism (26Qiu W. Wernimont A. Tang K. Taylor S. Lunin V. Schapira M. Fentress S. Hui R. Sibley L.D. Novel structural and regulatory features of rhoptry secretory kinases in Toxoplasma gondii.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 969-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Importantly, the structure also identifies a novel second ligand binding pocket adjacent to the active site, which is critical for ROP18-mediated virulence and may provide an additional substrate specificity determinant or allosteric regulatory site. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The MIT Committee on Animal Care (assurance number A-3125-01) approved all protocols. All mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. The ROP18 kinase domain (residues 187–554) was cloned into pETDL4.0, a modified pET28a vector (Novagen), which incorporated a series of N-terminal fusion tags consisting of: (His6)-(λ-phosphatase)-(glutatathione S-transferase)-(maltose-binding protein)-(Streptococcus protein B1 domain)-(tobacco etch virus cleavage site) (His6- λ-phosphatase-GST-MBP-Gb1). Inclusion of λ-phosphatase in the fusion tags allowed production of a catalytically active wild type ROP18 kinase domain free of any autophosphorylation. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 (Novagen). For large scale preparations, the protein was first purified on a nickel SepahroseTM Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), followed by an amylose column (New England Biolabs). Tobacco etch virus protease was then added to cleave the N-terminal fusion tags, which were subsequently removed by passage of the protein through a GSH-agarose column and a final gel filtration step. The protein was then concentrated and frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80 °C. Small scale preparations of WT and mutant ROP18 kinase domain constructs were expressed as His6-GST-MBP-Gb1 fusions and batch purified on amylose beads and used directly for in vitro kinase assays. The ROP18 kinase domain was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion, in which 1 μl of 10 mg/ml of protein in 15 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm AMP-PNP, 2 mm MgSO4 was mixed with 1 μl of precipitant solution and equilibrated over a reservoir of precipitant solution. Native crystals were grown using a precipitant solution containing 0.56 m ammonium sulfate, 15% PEG 3350, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 5.5, and 20 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. For holmium co-crystals of the ROP18 kinase domain, HoCl3 was substituted for MgSO4 (28Ku S.Y. Smith G.D. Howell P.L. ADP-2Ho as a phasing tool for nucleotide-containing proteins.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Crystals typically appeared overnight and grew to full size after a few days. Native crystals were cryo-protected by stepwise transfer to 0.56 m ammonium sulfate, 15% PEG 3350, 0.1 m BisTris, pH 5.5, 30% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mm AMP-PNP, and 2 mm MgSO4. Holmium co-crystals were cryo-protected by stepwise transfer to 10 mm HoCl3, 0.28 m ammonium sulfate, 13% PEG 3350, 70 mm BisTris, pH 5.5, 30 mm MES, pH 6, 33.3% sucrose, and 1 mm AMP-PNP. Cryo-protected crystals were flash cooled in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected on the 24-ID-E and 24-ID-C beam lines at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory using an ADSC Quantum 315 detector. Data were processed using HKL 2000 (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology, Macromolecular Crystallography, part A. Vol. 276.

Kinase assays using fixed sequence peptide substrates were conducted at room temperature using either 69 ng of untagged WT ROP18 kinase domain or 150 ng of His6-GST-MBP-GB1-tagged WT or mutant ROP18 kinase domain, and a reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm MgSO4, and 60 μm cold ATP. Each reaction contained 0.5 mm peptide substrate and 2–10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped by spotting on Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper, which were then dried and washed with 0.425% phosphoric acid until no significant radioactivity remained in the washes. Radioactivity captured on P81 filters was then quantified by phosphorimage analysis with ImageQuant 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). Immunoprecipitation kinase assays of HA-tagged full-length ROP18 constructs were performed as previously described (48Niedelman W. Gold D.A. Rosowski E.E. Sprokholt J.K. Lim D. Farid Arenas A.

https://openalex.org/W2075770587,"Desmosomes are prominent cell-cell adhesive junctions in stratified squamous epithelia and disruption of desmosomal adhesion has been shown to have dramatic effects on the function and integrity of these tissues. During normal physiologic processes, such as tissue development and wound healing, intercellular adhesion must be modified locally to allow coordinated cell movements. The mechanisms that control junction integrity and adhesive strength under these conditions are poorly understood. We utilized a proteomics approach to identify plakophilin-3 associated proteins and identified the 14-3-3 family member stratifin. Stratifin interacts specifically with plakophilin-3 and not with other plakophilin isoforms and mutation analysis demonstrated the binding site includes serine 285 in the amino terminal head domain of plakophilin-3. Stratifin interacts with a cytoplasmic pool of plakophilin-3 and is not associated with the desmosome in cultured cells. FRAP analysis revealed that decreased stratifin expression leads to an increase in the exchange rate of cytoplasmic plakophilin-3/GFP with the pool of plakophilin-3/GFP in the desmosome resulting in decreased desmosomal adhesion and increased cell migration. We propose a model by which stratifin plays a role in regulating plakophilin-3 incorporation into the desmosomal plaque by forming a plakophilin-3 stratifin complex in the cytosol and thereby affecting desmosome dynamics in squamous epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2000511142,"We focused on transcription factors and epigenetic marks that regulate the B3GALT5 gene through its retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. We compared the expression levels of the B3GALT5 LTR transcript, quantitated by competitive RT-PCR, with those of the candidate transcription factors HNF1α/β and Cdx1/2, determined by Western blot analysis, in colon cancer biopsies, various cell lines, and cell models serving as controls. We found that HNF1α/β were easily detected, irrespective of the amount of LTR transcript expressed by the source, whereas Cdx1/2 were undetectable, and no sample lacking HNF1α/β expressed the LTR transcript. On transfection in proper host cells, both HNF1α and HNF1β provided detectable LTR transcript, whereas shRNA-mediated silencing of HNF1β impaired transcription. Treating cells with 5‘-aza-2‘-deoxycytidine (5AZA) strongly reduced expression, without affecting HNF1α/β, despite the lack of CpG islands in the LTR and proximal sequences. By electrophoresis mobility shift and luciferase reporter assays, the LTR promoter binding and activity did not correlate with the amounts of LTR transcript expressed in the cells and depended on the levels of the transcription factors. We conclude that HNF1α/β are necessary but insufficient to activate and regulate B3GALT5 LTR transcription, which depends on unknown regulatory elements that are active when methylated and located outside of and far from the LTR promoter.—Zulueta, A., Caretti, A., Signorelli, P., Dall'Olio, F., Trinchera, M.

Some 75% of the known E2s in the human proteome contain unique insertions in their primary sequences, yet it is largely unclear what effect these insertions impart on the ubiquitination reaction. Cdc34 is an important E2 with prominent roles in cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. The amino acid sequence of Cdc34 contains an insertion distal to the active site that is absent in most other E2s, yet this acidic loop (named for its four invariably conserved acidic residues) is critical for Cdc34 function both in vitro and in vivo. Here we have investigated how the acidic loop in human Cdc34 promotes ubiquitination, identifying two key molecular events during which the acidic loop exerts its influence. First, the acidic loop promotes the interaction between Cdc34 and its ubiquitin ligase partner, SCF. Second, two glutamic acid residues located on the distal side of the loop collaborate with an invariably conserved histidine on the proximal side of the loop to suppress the pKa of an ionizing species on ubiquitin or Cdc34 which greatly contributes to Cdc34 catalysis.

https://openalex.org/W2102841803,"Drag-reducing polymers (DRPs) significantly increase blood flow, tissue perfusion, and tissue oxygenation in various animal models. In rectangular channel microfluidic systems, DRPs were found to significantly reduce the near-wall cell-free layer (CFL) as well as modify traffic of red blood cells (RBC) into microchannel branches. In the current study we further investigated the mechanism by which DRP enhances microvascular perfusion. We studied the effect of various concentrations of DRP on RBC distribution in more relevant round microchannels and the effect of DRP on CFL in the rat cremaster muscle in vivo. In round microchannels hematocrit was measured in parent and daughter branch at baseline and after addition of DRP. At DRP concentrations of 5 and 10 ppm, the plasma skimming effect in the daughter branch was eliminated, as parent and daughter branch hematocrit were equivalent, compared to a significantly lowered hematocrit in the daughter branch without DRPs. In anesthetized rats (N=11) CFL was measured in the cremaster muscle tissue in arterioles with a diameter of 32.6 ± 1.7 µm. In the control group (saline, N=6) there was a significant increase in CFL in time compared to corresponding baseline. Addition of DRP at 1 ppm (N=5) reduced CFL significantly compared to corresponding baseline and the control group. After DRP administration the CFL reduced to about 85% of baseline at 5, 15, 25 and 35 minutes after DRP infusion was complete. These in vivo and in vitro findings demonstrate that DRPs induce a reduction in CFL width and plasma skimming in the microvasculature. This may lead to an increase of RBC flux into the capillary bed, and thus explain previous observations of a DRP mediated enhancement of capillary perfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2038368671,"The six species and three subspecies in the genus Chimarrogale (Soricomorpha: Soricidae) are commonly referred to as Asiatic water shrews. The Chimarrogale are the most widely distributed group of Nectogaline shrews, extending throughout the Oriental region and Japan. Because of the limited numbers of specimens available for study, the phylogenetic relationships and biogeographical history of this genus have not been comprehensively discussed. We used mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences to estimate phylogenetic relationships and divergence times among four Chimarrogale species, including all three subspecies of Chimarrogale himalayica. We also conducted a species delimitation analysis and tested two alternative migration scenarios in Asia through species distribution modeling and a reconstruction of the ancestral distribution. Here, we present the first proposed hypothesis regarding the Asiatic water shrew phylogeny and reveal ten putative species within the four recognized species. Distinct phylogenetic statuses of Chimarrogale phaeura, Chimarrogale platycephala, and Chimarrogale styani were confirmed. Chimarrogale himalayica was strongly supported as paraphyletic. We suggest that three subspecies of Chimarrogale himalayica should be reconsidered as distinct species. However, these suggestions must be considered with caution because only a single locus of a mtDNA gene was used. Four additional putative species, possibly distributed in central southwestern China and Taiwan, are currently undescribed; therefore, comprehensive morphological analyses are warranted to test their taxonomic statuses. The estimated molecular divergence times indicated that rapid speciation occurred during the early Pliocene, and current distribution patterns may have been affected by global cooling during the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary. Reconstruction of the ancestral distribution and species distribution modeling for Asiatic water shrews revealed a low-latitude migration route over which ancestral Chimarrogale migrated from Europe via Central Asia to their current distribution. Our results demonstrated that Asiatic water shrews could have evolved throughout the low-latitude migration route from Europe to East and Southeast Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2076562856,"The bacteriophage P22 coat protein has the common HK97-like fold but with a genetically inserted domain (I-domain). The role of the I-domain, positioned at the outermost surface of the capsid, is unknown. We hypothesize that the I-domain may act as an intramolecular chaperone because the coat protein folds independently, and many folding mutants are localized to the I-domain. The function of the I-domain was investigated by generating the coat protein core without its I-domain and the isolated I-domain. The core coat protein shows a pronounced folding defect. The isolated I-domain folds autonomously and has a high thermodynamic stability and fast folding kinetics in the presence of a peptidyl prolyl isomerase. Thus, the I-domain provides thermodynamic stability to the full-length coat protein so that it can fold reasonably efficiently while still allowing the HK97-like core to retain the flexibility required for conformational switching during procapsid assembly and maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1983025100,"Gene amplification plays a pivotal role in malignant transformation of human cells. A plasmid with both a mammalian replication-initiation region (IR)/origin/replicator and a nuclear matrix-attachment region (MAR) is spontaneously amplified in transfected cells by a mechanism that involves amplification at the extrachromosomal site, followed by amplification at the chromosomal arm, ultimately generating a long homogeneously staining region (HSR). Several observations suggest that replication initiation from IR sequences might mediate amplification. To test this idea, we previously dissected c-myc and DHFR IRs to identify the minimum sequence required to support amplification. In this study, we applied an improved analysis that discriminates between two amplification steps to the ß-globin RepP IR, which contains separate elements already known to be essential for initiation on the chromosome arm. The IR sequence was required at least for the extrachromosomal amplification step. In addition to the vector-encoded MAR, amplification also required an AT-rich region and a MAR-like element, consistent with the results regarding replicator activity on the chromosome. However, amplification did not require the AG-rich tract necessary for replicator activity, but instead required a novel sequence containing another AG-rich tract. The differential sequence requirement might be a consequence of extrachromosomal replication."

The interaction was further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in vitro and in vivo. Deletion mutagenesis revealed that two regions of the TROY intracellular domain (amino acids 234–256 and 321–350) were essential for the interaction with RhoGDIα. Secondly, TROY and RhoGDIα were coexpressed in postnatal dorsal root ganglion neurons, cortex neurons, and cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Thirdly, TROY/RhoGDIα association was potentiated by Nogo-66 and was independent of p75/RhoGDIα interaction. Fourthly, TROY/RhoGDIα interaction was still able to activate RhoA when p75 was deficient.

RhoGDIα is ubiquitously distributed across the postnatal CNS and can regulate RhoA activity by binding to and sequestering RhoA in the cytosol and protecting RhoA from formation of active RhoGTP (14Garcia-Mata R.

Unlike p75, TROY lacks the mastoparan-like α helix and the death domain in its intracellular region, which raises the question whether TROY can utilize RhoGDIα to achieve RhoA activation, thereby inhibiting neurite outgrowth. To date, the underlying mechanism that makes TROY activate RhoA remains elusive. In this study, we identified RhoGDIα as a binding partner of TROY. The association of RhoGDIα with TROY was further confirmed in vitro and in vivo.

For identification of possible TROY-ICD-binding proteins, the supernatants were subjected to two-dimensional SDS-PAGE/isoelectric focusing followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectra analysis. The supernatants were also applied to a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel, and Western blot analyses were conducted using anti-GST and anti-RhoGDIα antibodies to confirm the TROY/RhoGDIα interaction. For the detection of direct TROY/RhoGDIα interaction, purified GST-TROY-ICD and His-RhoGDIα were used. Purified, bacterially expressed His-RhoGDIα was prepared using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to the protocols of the manufacturer. GST-TROY-ICD or GST was first incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and then incubated with an equal amount of purified His-RhoGDIα in GST binding buffer. After washing, protein complexes were eluted from glutathione, separated on a 12% gel by SDS-PAGE, and followed by Western blot analysis. HEK293T cell lysates, cerebellar granule neurons, and brain tissues homogenates from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats or 7-day-old C57/BL6J mice (P7) were prepared as described previously (17Liu X.

Briefly, the tissues and cells were lysed in solubilization buffer (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 125 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.32 m sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, and mixture protease inhibitors). Proteins solubilized from each homogenate were quantified using a BCA kit (Beyotime, Haimen, China). Equal amounts of protein were first incubated with primary antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C under mild agitation. Protein G-agarose beads (Roche) were then added for 3 h. After washing three times with solubilization buffer, the immunoprecipitated samples were boiled for 10 min in sample loading buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 12% SDS-PAGE and subsequently electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C under mild agitation. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Kangcheng, Shanghai, China) was used. The blots were visualized by an ECL reaction system (Pierce). Densitometry analysis was performed by QuantityOne (Bio-Rad). Cerebellar granule neuron (CGNs) cultures were prepared according to a procedure described previously (19Hatten M.E. Neuronal regulation of astroglial morphology and proliferation in vitro.J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Seven-day-old, wild-type C57BL/6J mice or p75-deficient mice were sacrificed by decapitation to get primary CGNs. After dissociation and filtering, cells were first cultured on poly-L-lysine-coated (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma), 6-well tissue culture plates or 8 × 8 mm coverslips and maintained in DMEM/F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Neurobasal-A medium completed with 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 1% N2 supplement, 20 mm Gluta MAX, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen,) was used 3 h later. Cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. After 24-hour incubation, the CGNs were harvested for coimmunoprecipitation or Western blot analysis. For transfection of DNA constructs, CGNs were subjected to electrotransfection (O-05 program, Amaxa Biosystems, Köln, Germany) right after dissection and according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The cells were plated directly on coverslips precoated with 10 μg/ml mouse laminin (Invitrogen) in 10% FBS/DMEM. The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium 3 h after transfection. Cultured cells were gently rinsed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. The fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then stained with FITC- or TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and Vector Laboratories). For immunohistochemistry, animals were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) (20Jiao L. Zhang Y. Hu C. Wang Y.G. Huang A. He C. Rap1GAP interacts with RET and suppresses GDNF-induced neurite outgrowth.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Brains were removed from the cranial vaults, post-fixed for 2 h in the same fixative, and then cryopreserved overnight in 20% sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at 4 °C. Frozen sections were cut at a thickness of 14 μm and incubated in blocking buffer containing 5% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min. After blocking, the brain sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibodies diluted in the same blocking buffer. After rinsing in PBS, sections were incubated with FITC- or TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-goat IgG antibodies. Images were obtained using a Nikon fluorescent microscope or a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. RhoA activity in cell lysates was analyzed using a Rho activation assay kit (Millipore) according to the instructions of the manufacturer and our previous report (21Su Z. Cao L. Zhu Y. Liu X. Huang Z. Huang A. He C. Nogo enhances the adhesion of olfactory ensheathing cells and inhibits their migration.J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1877-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

About 20 μl of each lysate was used for protein quantification and Western blot analysis of total RhoA. For detection of the active RhoA (GTP-bound RhoA), equal amounts of protein from each sample were incubated with Rhotekin binding domain (RBD) affinity agarose beads for 45 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (10 s, 14,000 × g, 4 °C), pellet beads were washed three times in the wash buffer. Bound proteins were collected and examined by Western blot analysis. The amount of GTP-bound RhoA was normalized to the total amount of RhoA in cell lysates as described previously (22Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B.

Statistical analysis was performed for data from three independent experiments. Data were shown as mean ± S.D. A neurite outgrowth assay was performed as described previously (24Wang K.C. Kim J.A.

After GFP-RhoGDIα or control GFP-N2 vector transfection, dissociated primary CGNs were plated onto immobilized substrate (GST or GST-Nogo-66 (50 ng/cm2) (2Park J.B. Yiu G. Kaneko S. Wang J. Chang J.

Cells were cultured for 24 h before fixation and staining. Cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon). Neurite lengths were measured using ImageJ software. For each GFP-positive neuron, the length of the longest neurite was measured. The averaged neurite lengths of each group were normalized to that of wild-type CGNs with neither Nogo-66 treatment nor RhoGDIα overexpression. Three independent experiments, at least 150 neurons/condition from duplicate wells, were performed. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with post hoc Bonferroni (homogeneity of variances assumed) or Games-Howell (homogeneity of variances not assumed) comparisons. All values were expressed as mean ± S.D. Although TROY acts as a coreceptor to form a tripartite complex with NgR·LINGO-1 and activates RhoA to exert axon regrowth inhibition (2Park J.B. Yiu G.

TAJ/TROY, an orphan TNF receptor family member, binds Nogo-66 receptor 1 and regulates axonal regeneration.Neuron. 2005; 45: 353-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), the possible mechanism by which TROY activates RhoA is scarcely reported. We proposed to gain an insight into the TROY signaling pathway through searching binding partners of the TROY-ICD. GST-TROY-ICD fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 cells, extracted, and purified. The purified GST-TROY-ICD recombinant protein was then incubated with rat brain lysates to pull down the binding candidates. GST protein was used as the control for GST-TROY-ICD. The bound samples were subjected to two-dimensional SDS-PAGE/isoelectric focusing with MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectra analysis. Using the Mascot program (Matrix Science, London, UK), we identified RhoGDIα as a candidate with the following indicators: Mascot score, 95; molecular weight, 23393; calculated pI, 5.12; and percent sequence coverage, 32%. The association of RhoGDIα with the TROY-ICD was further confirmed by GST precipitation assay with rat brain lysates. As shown in Fig. 1A, endogenous RhoGDIα could be precipitated by GST-TROY-ICD but not by GST. We next checked the direct interaction between TROY and RhoGDIα using an in vitro GST pull-down assay with purified His-RhoGDIα and GST-TROY-ICD. Consistent with the above results, we found that GST-TROY-ICD, but not GST, could interact with His-RhoGDI α (Fig. 1B). To further investigate whether TROY-ICD and RhoGDIα could form a complex in vitro and in vivo, a reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed. In HEK293T cells expressing both GFP-tagged RhoGDIα and Myc-tagged TROY-ICD (Fig. 1, C and D), GFP-RhoGDIα could specifically immunoprecipitate with Myc-TROY-ICD and vice versa. Moreover, in lysates of cultured mouse CGNs (Fig. 1, E and F) and mouse whole brain (G), endogenous TROY and RhoGDIα were immunoprecipitated with each other. These data supported the interaction of TROY with RhoGDIα in vitro and in vivo. Because TROY-ICD does not contain the death domain and the mastoparan-like α helix that p75 uses to bind to RhoGDIα (Fig. 2A), we next mapped the region responsible for TROY/RhoGDIα interaction by deletion mutagenesis. A series of C- and N-terminal truncation mutants of TROY-ICD tagged with HA were constructed and named mutant 1–8 (Fig. 2B, M1–8). These mutants were separately cotransfected into HEK293T cells with GFP-RhoGDIα. The transfected cells were lysed 48 h later and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-HA or anti-GFP antibody. All of the TROY-ICD mutants and RhoGDIα constructs were detected at the predicted molecular mass (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). The lysates were then subjected to coimmunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis with the corresponding antibodies. When an anti-GFP antibody was used to immunoprecipitate with the cell lysates, HA-tagged M1 (aa 194–390), M2 (aa 194–371), M3 (aa 194–350), and M6 (aa 234–416) were detected in the precipitates, whereas M4 (aa 194–321), M5 (aa 194–285), M7 (aa 256–416), and M8 (aa 276–416) were not detected (Fig. 2C). When cotransfected cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA antibody, GFP-tagged RhoGDIα cotransfected with M1, M2, M3, and M6, but not M4, M5, M7, or M8, were detected in the precipitates (Fig. 2D). We are inclined to conclude that two regions of TROY-ICD (aa 234–256 and 321–350) are indispensable for RhoGDIα association, although it is possible that the largest N-terminal and C-terminal deletions present in M7/M8 and M4/M5, respectively, may affect interaction through misfolding. As colocalization was the premise of functional interaction, we next examined whether TROY and RhoGDIα were colocalized in postnatal neurons. Double immunofluorescent staining revealed that both TROY and RhoGDIα were strongly expressed in primary CGNs, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and cortex neurons (Fig. 3, A–C). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed that TROY and RhoGDIα were coexpressed in most DRG neurons and were broadly codistributed in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex neurons (Fig. 3, D–F). These results support the coexpression pattern of TROY and RhoGDIα in postnatal neurons in these regions. To resist the possibility that TROY/RhoGDIα interaction was incidental or not associated with MAIF signaling, we examined the influence of Nogo-66 treatment on TROY/RhoGDIα interaction in cultured CGNs. After GST or GST-Nogo-66 (100 nm) treatment for 30 min, the CGNs were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation to detect the association of TROY with RhoGDIα. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, GST-Nogo-66 but not GST treatment significantly enhanced TROY/RhoGDIα association. p75 has been reported to be coexpressed with TROY and could associate with RhoGDIα in CGNs (26Harrington A.W.

To exclude the possible influences of p75, we repeated the experiment in cultured p75-deficient (p75−/−) CGNs. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, the significant increase of TROY/RhoGDIα association by GST-Nogo-66 was still detected when p75 was deficient. Taken together, these resul"

https://openalex.org/W2021233056,"Oncogenic mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) predict prognosis and therapeutic responses to imatinib. In wild-type GISTs, the tumor-initiating events are still unknown, and wild-type GISTs are resistant to imatinib therapy. We performed an association study between copy number alterations (CNAs) identified from array CGH and gene expression analyses results for four wild-type GISTs and an imatinib-resistant PDGFRA D842V mutant GIST, and compared the results to those obtained from 27 GISTs with KIT mutations. All wild-type GISTs had multiple CNAs, and CNAs in 1p and 22q that harbor the SDHB and GSTT1 genes, respectively, correlated well with expression levels of these genes. mRNA expression levels of all SDH gene subunits were significantly lower (P≤0.041), whereas mRNA expression levels of VEGF (P=0.025), IGF1R (P=0.026), and ZNFs (P<0.05) were significantly higher in GISTs with wild-type/PDGFRA D842V mutations than GISTs with KIT mutations. qRT-PCR validation of the GSTT1 results in this cohort and 11 additional malignant GISTs showed a significant increase in the frequency of GSTT1 CN gain and increased mRNA expression of GSTT1 in wild-type/PDGFRA D842V GISTs than KIT-mutant GISTs (P=0.033). Surprisingly, all four malignant GISTs with KIT exon 11 deletion mutations with primary resistance to imatinib had an increased GSTT1 CN and mRNA expression level of GSTT1. Increased mRNA expression of GSTT1 and ZNF could be predictors of a poor response to imatinib. Our integrative approach reveals that for patients with wild-type (or imatinib-resistant) GISTs, attempts to target VEGFRs and IGF1R may be reasonable options."
https://openalex.org/W1978551577,"The prototypical 5'-nuclease, flap endonuclease-1 (FEN1), catalyzes the essential removal of single-stranded flaps during DNA replication and repair. FEN1 hydrolyzes a specific phosphodiester bond one nucleotide into double-stranded DNA. This specificity arises from double nucleotide unpairing that places the scissile phosphate diester on active site divalent metal ions. Also related to FEN1 specificity is the helical arch, through which 5'-flaps, but not continuous DNAs, can thread. The arch contains basic residues (Lys-93 and Arg-100 in human FEN1 (hFEN1)) that are conserved by all 5'-nucleases and a cap region only present in enzymes that process DNAs with 5' termini. Proline mutations (L97P, L111P, L130P) were introduced into the hFEN1 helical arch. Each mutation was severely detrimental to reaction. However, all proteins were at least as stable as wild-type (WT) hFEN1 and bound substrate with comparable affinity. Moreover, all mutants produced complexes with 5'-biotinylated substrate that, when captured with streptavidin, were resistant to challenge with competitor DNA. Removal of both conserved basic residues (K93A/R100A) was no more detrimental to reaction than the single mutation R100A, but much less severe than L97P. The ability of protein-Ca(2+) to rearrange 2-aminopurine-containing substrates was monitored by low energy CD. Although L97P and K93A/R100A retained the ability to unpair substrates, the cap mutants L111P and L130P did not. Taken together, these data challenge current assumptions related to 5'-nuclease family mechanism. Conserved basic amino acids are not required for double nucleotide unpairing and appear to act cooperatively, whereas the helical cap plays an unexpected role in hFEN1-substrate rearrangement."
https://openalex.org/W2065060557,"Wnt/β-catenin signaling is highly regulated and critical for intestinal epithelial development and repair; aberrant β-catenin signaling is strongly associated with colon cancer. The small GTPase Rac1 regulates β-catenin nuclear translocation and signaling. Here we tested the hypothesis that β1Pix, a Cdc42/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), regulates β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity and cell function. We report the novel observations that β1Pix binds directly to β-catenin, an action requiring both the β1Pix DH and dimerization domains but not β1Pix GEF activity. In human colon cancer cells, activation of β-catenin signaling with LiCl decreased β1Pix/β-catenin association in the cytosol and increased nuclear binding of β-catenin to β1Pix. Nuclear association of β1Pix and β-catenin was independent of Rac1 expression and activation; down- and up-regulating Rac1 expression levels did not alter nuclear β1Pix/β-catenin association. Ectopic β1Pix expression enhanced LiCl-induced β-catenin transcriptional activity. Conversely, siRNA knockdown of β1Pix attenuated both LiCl-induced β-catenin transcriptional activity and colon cancer cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of β1Pix stimulated β-catenin transcriptional activity, whereas β1PixΔ(602-611), which is unable to bind β-catenin, had no effect. Altogether, these findings suggest that β1Pix functions as a transcriptional regulator of β-catenin signaling through direct interaction with β-catenin, an action that may be functionally relevant to colon cancer biology."
https://openalex.org/W2071873992,"Background and Aims Previous studies have shown impaired cerebral autoregulation (CA) in carotid and middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis/occlusion. Little is known about CA in patients with basilar artery (BA) stenosis. We therefore investigated dynamic CA patterns in BA stenosis using transfer function analysis (TFA). Methods We measured spontaneous oscillations of blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the right posterior cerebral artery (PCA), and left MCA and mean arterial pressure (ABP) continuously in 25 patients with BA stenosis (moderate n=16 with 50-69% occlusion and severe n=9 with ≥70% occlusion) and 22 healthy volunteers in supine position during 6 circles per minute deep breath. Analysis was based on the ‘black-box’ model of transfer function deriving phase and gain in both PCA and MCA. Results Though changes of phase shift and gain between the patients and healthy controls were observed in MCA, the differences are however not significant. Phase shift in PCA was significantly decreased in severe stenosis when comparing with healthy controls and moderate stenosis (4.2±34.2° VS 41.1±40.4°, 4.2±34.2° VS 34.2±27.2°, both p<0.05), whilst the gain in PCA is increased for moderate BA stenosis and decreased for severe BA stenosis. Furthermore, we found that phase shift were almost abolished in patients with ischemic stroke who developed unfavorable clinical outcome (mRs>2) on the 90 days after stroke onset. Conclusion Dynamic CA in PCA reduces in patients with severe BA stenosis and those with ischemic stroke who present poor outcome in 90 days after stroke onset. Phase shift might be a sensitive index prompting impaired CA in posterior circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2016606643,"Continuous systolic blood pressure (SBP) and interbeat intervals (IBI) recordings reveal sequences of consecutive beats in which SBP and heart rate change in opposite direction, representing negative feedback baroreflex mechanisms, as well as sequences in which SBP and heart rate change in the same direction (non-baroreflex), believed to represent feedforward control mechanisms. The present study was undertaken to assess the relationship between baroreflex and non-baroreflex sequences in end stage renal insufficiency.Continuous beat-to-beat SBP and IBI monitoring was performed in patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD, n=72), in age-matched patients after renal transplantation (TX, n=41) and healthy (control) individuals (C, n=34). The proportion of baroreflex and nonbaroreflex episodes and the b coefficients (the regression line slope of SBP-IBI correlation) were determined using a newly developed 1 minute sliding window method, the classical sequence technique and the ""Z"" coefficient method. Analysis using the 1 minute sliding window showed an increased proportion of baroreflex episodes in controls and HD, and predominance of nonbaroreflex episodes in TX. An increased proportion of nonbaroreflex episodes in TX patients relative to HD was also revealed by the ""Z"" method. Baroreflex and nonbaroreflex b coefficients obtained by all methods were markedly decreased in HD. This alteration was reversed at least partly in TX. In HD, both baroreflex and nonbaroreflex b coefficients were inversely correlated to age and CRP levels; in TX, the nonbaroreflex b coefficient was influenced by the type of calcineurin inhibitor.Renal status affects the contribution of baroreflex and nonbaroreflex mechanisms and the strength of SBP-IBI relationship. The predominant contribution of nonbaroreflex mechanisms in TX may be suggestive of enhanced central sympathetic control. Our data may be relevant for understanding of the pathogenesis and selection of appropriate treatment of post-transplant hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2036186619,"In the neonatal mouse ovary, clusters of oocytes called nests break into smaller cysts and subsequently form individual follicles. During this period, we found numerous mast cells in the ovary of MRL/MpJ mice and investigated their appearance and morphology with follicular development. The ovarian mast cells, which were already present at postnatal day 0, tended to localize adjacent to the surface epithelium. Among 11 different mouse strains, MRL/MpJ mice possessed the greatest number of ovarian mast cells. Ovarian mast cells were also found in DBA/1, BALB/c, NZW, and DBA/2 mice but rarely in C57BL/6, NZB, AKR, C3H/He, CBA, and ICR mice. The ovarian mast cells expressed connective tissue mast cell markers, although mast cells around the surface epithelium also expressed a mucosal mast cell marker in MRL/MpJ mice. Some ovarian mast cells migrated into the oocyte nests and directly contacted the compressed and degenerated oocytes. In MRL/MpJ mice, the number of oocytes in the nest was significantly lower than in the other strains, and the number of oocytes showed a positive correlation with the number of ovarian mast cells. The gene expression of a mast cell marker also correlated with the expression of an oocyte nest marker, suggesting a link between the appearance of ovarian ? 4mast cells and early follicular development. Furthermore, the expression of follicle developmental markers was significantly higher in MRL/MpJ mice than in C57BL/6 mice. These results indicate that the appearance of ovarian mast cells is a unique phenotype of neonatal MRL/MpJ mice, and that ovarian mast cells participate in early follicular development, especially nest breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W2077973651,"Hec1 and Nuf2, core components of the NDC80 complex, are essential for kinetochore-microtubule attachment and chromosome segregation. It has been shown that both Hec1 and Nuf2 utilize their coiled-coil domains to form a functional dimer; however, details of the consequential significance and structural requirements to form the dimerization interface have yet to be elucidated. Here, we showed that Hec1 required three contiguous heptad repeats from Leu-324 to Leu-352, but not the entire first coiled-coil domain, to ensure overall stability of the NDC80 complex through direct interaction with Nuf2. Substituting the hydrophobic core residues, Leu-331, Val-338, and Ile-345, of Hec1 with alanine completely eliminated Nuf2 binding and blocked mitotic progression. Moreover, unlike most coiled-coil proteins, where the buried positions are composed of hydrophobic residues, Hec1 possessed an unusual distribution of glutamic acid residues, Glu-334, Glu-341, and Glu-348, buried within the interior dimerization interface, which complement with three Nuf2 lysine residues: Lys-227, Lys-234, and Lys-241. Substituting these corresponding residues with alanine diminished the binding affinity between Hec1 and Nuf2, compromised NDC80 complex formation, and adversely affected mitotic progression. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that three buried glutamic acid-lysine pairs, in concert with hydrophobic interactions of core residues, provide the major specificity and stability requirements for Hec1-Nuf2 dimerization and NDC80 complex formation."
