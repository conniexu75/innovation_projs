https://openalex.org/W2027175712,"The use of near-infrared or infrared photons is a promising approach for biomedical imaging in living tissue. This technology often requires exogenous contrast agents with combinations of hydrodynamic diameter, absorption, quantum yield and stability that are not possible with conventional organic fluorophores. Here we show that the fluorescence emission of type II quantum dots can be tuned into the near infrared while preserving absorption cross-section, and that a polydentate phosphine coating renders them soluble, disperse and stable in serum. We then demonstrate that these quantum dots allow a major cancer surgery, sentinel lymph node mapping, to be performed in large animals under complete image guidance. Injection of only 400 pmol of near-infrared quantum dots permits sentinel lymph nodes 1 cm deep to be imaged easily in real time using excitation fluence rates of only 5 mW/cm(2). Taken together, the chemical, optical and in vivo data presented in this study demonstrate the potential of near-infrared quantum dots for biomedical imaging."

https://openalex.org/W1982508334,"The minimal gene set essential for life has long been sought. We report the 860-kb genome of the obligate intracellular plant pathogen phytoplasma (Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris, OY strain). The phytoplasma genome encodes even fewer metabolic functions than do mycoplasma genomes. It lacks the pentose phosphate cycle and, more unexpectedly, ATP-synthase subunits, which are thought to be essential for life. This may be the result of reductive evolution as a consequence of life as an intracellular parasite in a nutrient-rich environment."
https://openalex.org/W1986173894,"RNA silencing (also known as RNA interference) is a conserved biological response to double-stranded RNA that regulates gene expression, and has evolved in plants as a defence against viruses. The response is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which guide the sequence-specific degradation of cognate messenger RNAs. As a counter-defence, many viruses encode proteins that specifically inhibit the silencing machinery. The p19 protein from the tombusvirus is such a viral suppressor of RNA silencing and has been shown to bind specifically to siRNA. Here, we report the 1.85-A crystal structure of p19 bound to a 21-nucleotide siRNA, where the 19-base-pair RNA duplex is cradled within the concave face of a continuous eight-stranded beta-sheet, formed across the p19 homodimer interface. Direct and water-mediated intermolecular contacts are restricted to the backbone phosphates and sugar 2'-OH groups, consistent with sequence-independent p19-siRNA recognition. Two alpha-helical 'reading heads' project from opposite ends of the p19 homodimer and position pairs of tryptophans for stacking over the terminal base pairs, thereby measuring and bracketing both ends of the siRNA duplex. Our structure provides an illustration of siRNA sequestering by a viral protein."

The enzyme cleaves aggrecan core protein at several sites. Here we report that the non-catalytic ancillary domains of the enzyme play a major role in regulating aggrecanase activity, with the C-terminal spacer domain masking the general proteolytic activity. Expressing a series of domain deletion mutants in mammalian cells and examining their aggrecan-degrading and general proteolytic activities, we found that full-length ADAMTS-4 of 70 kDa was the most effective aggrecanase, but it exhibited little activity against the Glu373-Ala374 bond, the site originally characterized as a signature of aggrecanase activity. Little activity was detected against reduced and carboxymethylated transferrin (Cm-Tf), a general proteinase substrate. However, it readily cleaved the Glu1480-Gly1481 bond in the chondroitin sulfate-rich region of aggrecan. Of the constructed mutants, the C-terminal spacer domain deletion mutant more effectively hydrolyzed both the Glu373-Ala374 and Glu1480-Gly1481 bonds. It also revealed new activities against Cm-Tf, fibromodulin, and decorin. Further deletion of the cysteine-rich domain reduced the aggrecanase activity by 80% but did not alter the activity against Cm-Tf or fibromodulin. Further removal of the thrombospondin type I domain drastically reduced all tested proteolytic activities, and very limited enzymatic activity was detected with the catalytic domain. Full-length ADAMTS-4 binds to pericellular and extracellular matrix, but deletion of the spacer domain releases the enzyme. ADAMTS-4 lacking the spacer domain has promiscuous substrate specificity considerably different from that previously reported for aggrecan core protein. Finding of ADAMTS-4 in the interleukin-1α-treated porcine articular cartilage primarily as a 46-kDa form suggests that it exhibits a broader substrate spectrum in the tissue than originally considered.

O'Brien E. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has also been designated as “aggrecanase 1” based on its ability to cleave the Glu373-Ala374 bond located within the interglobular domain (IGD) of the aggrecan core protein (2Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C.

Human synovial fibroblasts also increase both mRNA and protein levels of ADAMTS-4 when treated with transforming growth factor β (10Yamanishi Y. Boyle D.L. Clark M. Maki R.A.

The enzyme is a multidomain metalloproteinase, consisting of a large propeptide, a catalytic metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin (Dis), a thrombospondin type I (TS), a cysteine-rich (CysR), and a spacer (Sp) domain (2Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C.

Besides the TEGE373∼374ARGS bond, recombinant ADAMTS-4 expressed in insect cells cleaves the core protein at GELE1480∼1481GR-GT, KEEE1666∼1667GLGS, TQAE1771∼1772AGEG, and VSQE1871∼1872LGQR sites (“∼” indicates the bond cleaved) in the chondroitin sulfate-rich CS-2 region of bovine aggrecan core protein (11Tortorella M.D. Pratta M.

These sites are more readily cleaved than the originally characterized cleavage Glu373-Ala374 bond (11Tortorella M.D. Pratta M. Liu R.Q. Austin J. Ross O.H. Abbaszade I. Burn T. Arner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18566-18573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the aggrecanase activity was not detected when the catalytic domain of ADAMTS-4 was expressed, although it retained the activity against a 41-residue synthetic peptide encompassing the Glu373-Ala374 bond (12Tortorella M.

It has also been reported that ADAMTS-4 is unable to cleave the core protein when aggrecan was deglycosylated by chondroitinase ABC and keratanase (12Tortorella M. Pratta M. Liu R.Q. Abbaszade I. Ross H. Burn T. Arner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25791-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interaction of the TS domain of the enzyme and anionic polysaccharide chains of aggrecan is considered to be important for the expression of aggrecanase activity, because a peptide harboring a potential heparan sulfate binding motif W(S/G)XW (14Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) inhibited the aggrecanase activity with an IC50 value in the low micromolar range (12Tortorella M. Pratta M. Liu R.Q. Abbaszade I. Ross H. Burn T. Arner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25791-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). More recently, however, Gao et al. (15Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) have reported that the full-length ADAMTS-4 expressed in mammalian cells exhibits little aggrecanase activity as determined by the detection of fragments with the newly generated N-terminal 374ARGSV378 sequence using a neoepitope antibody, but that this activity was greatly increased when the full-length ADAMTS-4 was processed to 60- and 50-kDa forms by removing the C-terminal part of the enzyme. Similar C-terminal processing was also reported that the recombinant ADAMTS-4 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary/A2 cells was autolytically processed to 53 and 40 kDa by cleaving Lys694-Phe695 and Thr581-Phe582 bonds, and both forms cleave aggrecan at the Glu373-Ala374 bond (16Flannery C.R. Zeng W. Corcoran C. Collins-Racie L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Hebert T. Mackie S.A. McDonagh T. Crawford T.K. Tomkinson K.N. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42775-42780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not clear which domains of the enzyme play a key role in aggrecanase activity. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the noncatalytic ancillary domains of ADAMTS-4 in aggrecan degradation. For this purpose, we have systematically deleted the ancillary domains from the C terminus and measured the aggrecanase activity of the truncated forms using four different assay methods: i) an aggrecan-polyacrylamide beads assay (17Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); (ii) detection of core protein fragments using the antibody 2-B-6 that recognizes the chondroitinase-generated chondroitin-4-sulfate “stubs” for general aggrecan degradation products (18Caterson B. Christner J.E. Baker J.R. Couchman J.R. Fed. Proc. 1985; 44: 386-393PubMed Google Scholar); (iii) detecting the cleavage at the Glu373-Ala374 bond in the IGD (19Hughes C.E. Caterson B. Fosang A.J. Roughley P.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 799-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); and (iv) at the Glu1480-Gly1481 bond in the CS-2 region using specific neoepitope antibodies. We have also examined other protein substrates, including reduced, carboxymethylated transferrin (Cm-Tf). The results show that considerable changes occur in substrate specificity upon deletion of each domain. Full-length ADAMTS-4 binds to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the cell surface, but the deletion of the C-terminal Sp domain releases the enzyme from these sites. Direct extraction of ADAMTS-4 from porcine articular cartilage treated with interleukin-1α (IL-1α) indicated that the majority of the enzyme in such tissues lacks a portion of the C-terminal domains. Our studies suggest that ADAMTS-4 in the tissue may have a broader substrate spectrum than has previously been considered and trafficking of the enzyme is also regulated in the extracellular space by C-terminal processing.

Couchman J.R. Fed. Proc. 1985; 44: 386-393PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Construction of cDNA Coding for ADAMTS-4 and the C-terminal Deletion Mutants—cDNA encoding human ADAMTS-4 was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the total RNA extracted from human primary chondrocytes. The PCR was carried out for 35 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), annealing (30 s at 60 °C), and extension (1 min at 72 °C) using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase with specific primers, derived from human ADAMTS-4 DNA sequence (NCBI accession number: NM005099). The two primers used were: 5′ forward primer, 5′-ATGTCCCAGACAGGCTCGCATCCC-3′; and 3′ reverse primer, 5′-TTATTTCCTGCCCGCCCTCC-3′. A PCR fragment (2500 bp) was ligated into pUC19 plasmid vector (pUC19-ADAMTS-4), and the nucleotide sequence determined and confirmed as human ADAMTS-4. To construct the vector expressing the full-length ADAMTS-4 (TS4-1), PCR was first performed with the forward primer, 5′-GGAATTCGCCACCATGTCCCAGACAGGCTCG-3′ (ADAMTS-4/FW/EcoRI) containing EcoRI site (underlined), Kozak consensus sequence (in italic) (25Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar) and ADAMTS-4 N-terminal sequence, and the reverse primer, 5′-GTCATCGTCATCTTTATAATCTTTCCTGCCCGCCCAGGG-3′ (TS4-1/R-V/FLAG) containing the FLAG epitope (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-stop) (in italic) and the C-terminal sequence of ADAMTS-4 using the pUC19-ADAMTS-4 vector as a template. The second PCR was carried out using the first PCR product as a template with the same 5′ forward primer as the first PCR (ADAMTS-4/FW/EcoRI) and the 3′ reverse primer 5′-TAGACTCGAGTTACTTGTCATCGTCATCTTTATA-3′ (FLAG/RV/XhoI) containing XhoI site (underlined) and the FLAG epitope sequence (in italic). The resulting cDNA (2.5 kb) was ligated into pMT/V5 His A vector and cloned into the pCEP4 vector. The domain deletion mutants were also constructed by PCR using the ADAMTS-4 FW EcoRI primer and the following 3′ reverse primers containing FLAG sequence (in italic): 5′-GTCATCGTCATCTTTATAATCGCTGCAACCAGAACCGTC-3′ (TS4-2/RV/FLAG); 5′-GTCATCGTCATCTTTATAATCTGGGCAGTCCTCAGTGTT-3′ (TS4-3/RV/FLAG); 5′-GTCATCGTCATCTTTATAATCAGCCTGTGGAATATTGAA-3′ (TS4-4/RV/FLAG); or 5′-GTCATCGTCATCTTTATAATCCACAGGCAGATGCAATGG-3′ (TS4-5/RV/FLAG) (see Fig. 1 for schematic representation of domain deletion mutants). The PCR products were cloned into the pCEP4 vector as described above. The inactive ADAMTS-4(E362A) mutant was constructed by PCR “megaprimer” method (26Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) with primers 5′-GCTCATGCCCTGGGTCATGTCTTCAACATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCCAGGGCATGAGCAGCAGTGAAGGCTGA-3′ (reverse), where the original codon GAA encoding Glu362 was mutated to GCC encoding Ala (underlined). Expression and Purification of the Recombinant ADAMTS-4 and Its Variants—The pCEP4 vector harboring ADAMTS-4 or its variants was transfected into 293-EBNA cells by lipofection with FuGENE6. The stably transfected cells were selected for hygromycin B resistance (200 μg/ml) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml). To obtain the recombinant protein, the culture media were replaced with DMEM containing 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate, penicillin, and streptomycin, and the conditioned media were harvested after 1 week. Full-length ADAMTS-4 (TS4-1) secreted from the cells bound to the cell surface and ECM, and little was detected in the medium. Thus, 100 μg/ml heparin was added during the culture, which released TS4-1 into the medium. The collected conditioned media (1 liter) were centrifuged to remove cell debris and applied to a column of anti-FLAG M2-agarose (2 ml) for purification. The material bound to the column was eluted with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3. The eluted recombinant ADAMTS-4 was further purified by gel filtration on S-200 Sephacryl equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Brij-35, and 0.02% NaN3 (TNC buffer). About 80% of aggrecanase activity in the conditioned medium of TS4-1 did not bind to anti-FLAG M2 agarose. To purify TS4-1 in the flow-through fraction, it was applied to a column of N-TIMP-3-Sepharose. The bound material was eluted with 6 m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl. The eluate was then dialyzed extensively against TNC buffer. The domain deletion variants were secreted into the medium. They were purified by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography and gel filtration as described above. The concentration of active recombinant ADAMTS-4 and variants were determined by titration with the known concentrations of N-TIMP-3. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Bury (27Bury A.F. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and proteins were stained by silver (28Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Precision protein standards were used as molecular weight markers. For Western blotting analyses, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked by 5% dry milk solution and reacted with the primary antibody anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:2000 dilution), anti-ADAMTS-4 catalytic domain antibody (1:1000 dilution), BC-3 neoepitope antibody (1:200 dilution), anti-GELE antibody (1:2000 dilution), or 2-B-6 antibody (1: 1000 dilution). The antigen·antibody complexes were then reacted with the second antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, and the protein bands were visualized using Western Blue stabilized substrate. Immunolocalization of ADAMTS-4 —Human chondrosarcoma HTB-94 cells were seeded and grown on gelatin-coated glass coverslips and transfected with the pCEP4 expression vector containing ADAMTS-4 cDNA or its variants by lipofection with FuGENE6. In the following day the cells were washed once with serum-free DMEM and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 48 h. The cell layers were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed using 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 7 min, washed with PBS four times and incubated in blocking solution (3% (w/v) bovine albumin and 5% (v/v) goat serum in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The cell layers were then reacted with the primary antibodies, the mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1: 2000 dilution), and rabbit anti-(catalytic domain of human ADAMTS-4) IgG (1:500 dilution) in the blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. The specimens were then washed twice with PBS and incubated with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-(mouse IgG) IgG (1:500 dilution) and Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-(rabbit IgG) IgG (1:500 dilution)) in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The specimens were washed twice with PBS and fixed again with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and samples were incubated with Alexa-660-conjugated phalloidin in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS to visualize the actin filaments within the cell. The samples were viewed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope equipped with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Ultraview Live Cell Imaging System using excitation and emission wavelengths at 488 and 525 nm for Alexa-488, at 568 and 607 nm for Alexa-568, and at 647 and 700 nm for Alexa-660, respectively. Aggrecanase Assays—To quantitate aggrecan-degrading activity of ADAMTS-4 and variants, polyacrylamide beads co-polymerized with aggrecan monomers were used as described by Nagase and Woessner (17Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Dry aggrecan beads (1 mg of beads containing 180 μg of aggrecan) were hydrated in an Eppendorf tube by adding 100 μl of enzyme solution in TNC buffer and incubated at 37 °C for various periods of time. The beads were removed by brief centrifugation, and 10 μl of the supernatant reacted with 200 μl of dimethylmethylene blue dye solution to quantify the released glycosaminoglycans (GAG) according to Farndale et al. (29Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2907) Google Scholar). One unit of aggrecan-degrading activity is defined as release of 1 μg of GAG in 1 min at 37 °C. To determine aggrecanase activity by neoepitope antibodies, bovine aggrecan (500 nm) was incubated with 100 μl of ADAMTS-4 or its variants in TNC buffer at 37 °C for the indicated period of time. The reaction was terminated with 10 mm EDTA, and the digestion products were deglycosylated by chondroitinase ABC (0.01 unit/10 μg of aggrecan) and keratanase (0.01 unit/10 μg of aggrecan) in Tris acetate (pH 6.5), 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 3 h. The digestion products were then precipitated with 10 volumes of acetone and subjected to Western blotting analysis with the BC-3 antibody, anti-GELE, or 2-B-6 antibody as primary antibody as described by Little et al. (30Little C.B. Hughes C.E. Curtis C.L. Janusz M.J. Bohne R. Wang-Weigand S. Taiwo Y.O. Mitchell P.G. Otterness I.G. Flannery C.R. Caterson B. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). N-terminal Sequence Analysis of Cm-Tf and Fibromodulin Fragments—Cm-Tf (2.5 mg/ml) was incubated with 50 nm of TS4-2 in TNC buffer at 37 °C for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the relative rate of peptide bond cleavage of Cm-Tf. For N-terminal sequence analysis, Cm-Tf digested for 24 h was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, and the fragments were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The bands were excised, placed directly onto a Polybrene-treated glass filter, and sequenced by automated Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer with “on line” 120A PTH analysis. Fibromodulin (0.1 mg/ml) was reacted with 50 nm TS4-2 for 48 h, and the products were deglycosylated by PNGase F and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The fragment was sequenced as for Cm-Tf fragments. Identification of ADAMTS-4 in Porcine Articular Cartilage—Porcine articular cartilage (2 g) was sliced (approx 1 × 5 × 5 mm) and cultured in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum for 2 days. The tissue was then washed once with serum-free DMEM and cultured with or without IL-1α (10 ng/ml) in the same medium. The cartilage was harvested, and proteins were extracted with 10 ml of 4 m guanidine hydrochloride in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.8) containing a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (5 mm EDTA, 1 mm p-aminoethylbenzene sulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μm E-64) for 48 h at 4 °C. The cartilage extracts were mixed with 100 nm recombinant human TIMP-1 and 100 nm recombinant N-TIMP-3-His, and dialyzed extensively against TNC buffer. The dialyzed sample (3-ml aliquot) was mixed with 30 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose by inversion at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing the agarose beads with TNC buffer, the bound protein was eluted with 30 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 6 m urea and 500 mm NaCl and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-ADAMTS-4 catalytic domain antibody. Expression of the Recombinant ADAMTS-4 and C-terminal Domain Deletion Variants—Full-length mature form of ADAMTS-4 and the C-terminal domain deletion enzymes were purified from conditioned media by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. All preparations were homogenous on SDS-PAGE when stained with silver (Fig. 2A). Purified materials were also detected by Western blotting analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2B) and anti-catalytic domain antibody (Fig. 2C). Approximately 50 μg of the 70-kDa TS4-1 (full-length), 520 μg of the 53-kDa TS4-2 (Sp deletion), 620 μg of the 40-kDa TS4-3 (Sp and CysR deletion), 1.8 mg of the 35-kDa TS4-4 (Sp, CysR, and TS deletion), 1.2 mg of the 26-kDa TS4-5 (the catalytic domain), and 110 μg of the 70-kDa TS4-1(E362A) were purified from 1 liter of conditioned media. The N-terminal sequence analysis of the isolated ADAMTS-4 was Phe-Ala-Ser-Leu-Ser, indicating that the propeptide was processed intracellularly and mature forms were secreted from the cell. Full-length TS4-1 was largely found on the cell surface or bound to the ECM (see below), but the addition of heparin to the culture released the majority of TS4-1 into the medium. However, about 80% of the aggrecanase activity in the conditioned medium of TS4-1 did not bind to the anti-FLAG column, indicating a loss of the C-terminal FLAG during culture. When the unbound fraction was applied to a column of N-TIMP-3-Sepharose and eluted with 6 m urea in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm NaCl, tw"
https://openalex.org/W2073797247,"Proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix and tumor metastasis correlate with the expression of endopeptidases known as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The expression of MMPs is regulated by cytokines and signal transduction pathways, including those activated by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). We found that resveratrol, a phytoalexin present in grapes, significantly inhibits the PMA-induced increase in MMP-9 expression and activity. These effects of resveratrol are dose dependent and correlate with the suppression of MMP-9 mRNA expression levels. PMA caused about a 23-fold increase in MMP-9 promoter activity, which was suppressed by resveratrol. Transient transfection utilizing MMP-9 constructs, in which specific transcriptional factors were mutagenized, indicated that the effects of PMA and resveratrol were mediated via an activator protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB response element. Resveratrol inhibited PMA-mediated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and protein kinase C (PKC)-delta activation. Therefore, we conclude that the MMP-9 inhibition activity of resveratrol and its inhibition of JNK and PKC-delta may have a therapeutic potential, given that a novel means of controlling growth and invasiveness of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1978541038,"Keratinocyte-derived TNF-alpha acts as an endogenous tumour promoter and can also regulate AP-1 activity in mouse epidermis. To gain further insight into TNF-alpha signalling during skin tumour formation, mice deficient in TNFR1 (TNFR1-/- mice) or TNFR2 (TNFR2-/- mice) were subjected to chemical carcinogenesis. Tumour multiplicity was significantly reduced in TNFR1-/- and TNFR2-/- mice compared to wild-type (wt) mice, suggesting that both receptors have protumour activity. However, TNFR1-/- mice were markedly more resistant to tumour development than TNFR2-/- mice indicating that TNFR1 is the major mediator of TNF-alpha-induced tumour formation. TNFR1 and TNFR2 were both expressed in wt epidermis during tumour promotion and by primary keratinocytes in vitro. TPA-induced c-Jun expression was transient in TNFR1-/- and TNFR2-/- compared to wt epidermis and this was reflected by reduced induction of the AP-1-responsive genes granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and matrix metalloproteinase-3. These genes were differentially regulated in TNFR1-/- compared to TNFR2-/- epidermis, suggesting that the TNF-alpha receptors act independently via different AP-1 complexes to transduce TNF-alpha signals during tumour promotion. In addition, TNFR2 cooperated with TNFR1 to optimise TNFR1-mediated TNF-alpha bioactivity on keratinocytes in vitro. Our data provide further insight into TNF-alpha signalling in malignancy and provide some rationale for the use of TNF-alpha antagonists in the treatment of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2056716612,"TRPC proteins are the mammalian homologues of the Drosophila transient receptor potential channel and are involved in calcium entry after agonist stimulation of non-excitable cells. Seven mammalian TRPCs have been cloned, and their mechanisms of activation and regulation are still the subject of intense research. TRPC proteins interact with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, and the conformational coupling plays a critical role in the activation of calcium entry. Some evidence also supports an exocytotic mechanism as part of the activation of calcium entry. To investigate the possible involvement of exocytosis in TRPC6 activation, we evaluated the location of TRPC6 at the plasma membrane by biotinylation labeling of cell surface proteins and by indirect immunofluorescence marking of TRPC6 in stably transfected HEK 293 cells. We showed that when the muscarinic receptor was stimulated or the thapsigargin-induced intracellular calcium pool was depleted the level of TRPC6 at the plasma membrane increased. The carbachol concentration at which TRPC6 externalization occurred was lower than the concentration required to activate TRPC6. Externalization occurred within the first 30 s of stimulation, and TRPC6 remained at the plasma membrane as long as the stimulus was present.

Increases in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) regulate important cellular functions, including cell growth, differentiation, contraction, and secretion (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P.

The increase in [Ca2+]i is initiated by the activation of phospholipase Cβ or -γ by a Gq protein-coupled receptor or tyrosine kinase receptor, respectively, causing the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and generating two-second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; CCh, carbachol; CRM, caveolae-related microdomain; OAG, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol; TRPC, transient receptor potential canonical; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; HBSS, Hepes-buffered saline solution; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and diacylglycerol. IP3 binds to its specific receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum and causes the first phase of Ca2+ mobilization by releasing Ca2+ from the intracellular pool. The second phase involves Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane, which maintains [Ca2+]i above basal levels. No cellular activity has ever been observed in the absence of this second phase of Ca2+ mobilization. The TRPC protein family is involved in Ca2+ entry (3Birnbaumer L. Boulay G. Brown D. Jiang M.

Seven genes have been identified in the mammalian genome by homology with Drosophila TRP and TRPL, two proteins that are responsible for the light-induced current in insect phototransduction. TRPC channels are probably composed of four subunits, each containing three to four ankyrin-like repeats, two predicted coiled-coil regions (one in the amino terminus and another one in the carboxyl terminus), and a membrane-spanning region. The amino acids that link the fifth and sixth transmembrane segments form the putative pore region loop. Recent studies on the subunit arrangement of native TRPC in rat brain synaptosomes and the overexpression of TRPC in various systems suggest that the TRPC protein family can be subdivided in two distinct groups and that all members of one group can selectively assemble together to form a specific channel (6Goel M.

One group is composed of TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5, which share 65-85% homology in the amino acid sequences of their ankyrin repeat domains and carboxyl terminal coiled-coil regions (corresponding to the 42-777-amino acid segment of TRPC1). The other group is composed of TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7, which share about 80-90% homology in their amino acid sequences (corresponding to the 34-821 amino acid segment of TRPC3). There is ∼50% homology between the amino acid sequences of the two groups. Overexpression studies showed that the homotetramer channel consisting of TRPC1, TRPC4, or TRPC5 can be activated either by the depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ pool (8Zitt C. Zobel A.

This suggests that the presence of many accessory proteins in the signaling complexes may be necessary for Ca2+ entry. The precise mechanisms of the activation and regulation of TRPCs are still poorly understood. Three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain how Ca2+ entry channels are activated, 1) a diffusible message known as the Ca2+ influx factor, 2) a conformational coupling with the IP3 receptor, and 3) an exocytosis-like mechanism (26Putney Jr., J.W.

In the study presented here we show that the level of TRPC6 at the cell surface increased upon stimulation of a Gq protein-coupled receptor or depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ pool. The phenomenon was rapid and reversible and was produced with physiological concentrations of agonist. The exocytosis of TRPC6, which was localized in a caveolae or lipid rafts compartment, was not dependent on increased [Ca2+]i. Our results suggest that a regulated exocytosis pathway participates in the activation of TRPC6. Materials—Cell culture media, serum, G418, Hepes, and trypsin were purchased from Invitrogen.

All steps in the preparation of caveolae-related microdomains (CRM) were carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, the cells (3.5 × 107) were washed twice with ice-cold Hepes-buffered saline solution (HBSS; 120 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and then transferred to 2 ml of Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm MES, pH 6.8). The extract was homogenized with a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes). The homogenate was then adjusted to 45% (w/v) sucrose by adding an appropriate volume of 84% (w/v) sucrose prepared in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.8, and 150 mm NaCl), placed in an ultracentrifuge tube, overlaid with 4-ml layers each of 35 and 5% sucrose, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 16 h in a SW40 rotor (Beckman Coulter). After centrifugation, twelve 1-ml fractions were collected, and aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins—Monolayers of T6.11 HEK cells grown in 60-mm dishes were washed with HBSS and treated as required. The cells were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS (137 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and then incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 2 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce). The biotinylation reaction was terminated by washing the cells 3 times with ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm glycine. The cells were then lysed with 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by 20 passages through a 20-gauge needle and 15 passages through a 25-gauge needle. The cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation and added to 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) (50% slurry, pre-equilibrated in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer) and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. The biotin-streptavidin-agarose complexes were harvested by centrifugation and washed six times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The beads were then resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min before SDS-PAGE fractionation and Western blotting. Immunoblots—For immunoblots of TRPC6 and caveolin, the proteins were fractionated on standard SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) in 150 mm glycine, 20 mm Tris-base, and 20% methanol (350 mA, 3 h, 4 °C). The transfer of the IP3 receptor was performed in 48 mm Tris-base, 39 mm glycine, 0.037% SDS, pH 8.3 (450 mA, 24 h, 4 °C). The blots were stained with Ponceau S to visualize marker proteins, destained with TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20), and blocked for either 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C in TBST containing 5% (w/v) nonfat skim milk. The blots were then incubated for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies rabbit anti-TRPC6 (dilution 1:300), rabbit anti-caveolin (dilution 1:1000), or mouse anti-IP3 receptor type 3 (dilution 1:5000). After 3 washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, donkey anti-rabbit 1:20,000 or sheep anti-mouse 1:10,000 for 2 h at room temperature in TBST. The blots were washed three times with TBST, and the immune complexes were visualized with the ECL Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences). When required the bands were quantified with the Bio-Rad Gel Doc system using Quantity One software. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—T6.11 HEK cells (1.5 × 105) were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated 25-mm coverslips. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS, stimulated as required, and fixed in 100% methanol for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed, blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, incubated with the anti-TRPC6 antibody (dilution 1:100) for 2 h, and then incubated with the secondary Alexa 488-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit antibody (dilution 1:1000). The coverslips were washed three times with PBS. The cells were double-stained with 2 μg/ml propidium iodide for 30 min to visualize the cell nucleus. The coverslips were then rinsed twice in PBS before being mounted using Vectashield reagent (Vector Laboratories), and the fluorescence was viewed using an Axioscop 2 fluorescence microscope equipped with Nikon objectives and filter sets from Chroma Technology Corp. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—We used the method described by Zhu et al. (13Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) to measure [Ca2+]i. Briefly, T6.11 cells attached to poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips were washed twice with HBSS and loaded with fura 2/AM (0.2 μm in HBSS) for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. After a de-esterification step (washing and incubating in fresh HBSS for 30 min at room temperature) the coverslips were inserted into a circular open-bottom chamber and placed on the stage of a Zeiss Axovert microscope fitted with an Attofluor Digital Imaging and Photometry System (Attofluor Inc., Rockville, MD). Some 40-50 isolated fura 2-loaded cells were selected. The [Ca2+]i in the cells was measured by fluorescence videomicroscopy at room temperature using alternating excitation wavelengths of 334 and 380 nm and monitoring emitted fluorescence at 520 nm. Free [Ca2+]i was calculated from 334/380 fluorescence ratios following the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (36Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All reagents were diluted to their final concentrations in HBSS and applied to the cells by surface perfusion. Caveolae and lipid rafts are well characterized cell membrane microdomains containing many proteins involved in signal transduction. We used a protocol that relies on CRM resistance to solubilization in Triton X-100 at low temperatures and high buoyancy in sucrose density gradients to assess the presence of TRPC6 in CRMs. Fig. 1A shows a representative example of the fractionation scheme applied to T6.11 HEK cells. The fraction recovered at the interface of the 5 and 35% sucrose cushions contained the highest amount of caveolin-1/2 immunoreactivity even though it contained only a minor proportion of total cell proteins (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis for TRPC6 revealed that a fair amount of TRPC6 partitioned with caveolin-1/2 into the light fraction of the gradient. We previously showed that IP3 receptor type 3 co-immunoprecipitates with TRPC6 in these cells (33Boulay G. Brown D.M. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We, thus, looked at whether IP3 receptor type 3 partitioned with caveolin-1/2 and TRPC6. We found a detectable amount of IP3 receptor type 3 immunoreactivity associated with this fraction. Stimulation of T6.11 HEK cells with CCh, an agonist of the endogenous muscarinic receptor, or thapsigargin, a sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump inhibitor known to stimulate Ca2+ entry, did not increase the amount of TRPC6 or IP3 receptor in this fraction (data not shown). These results suggest that a stable complex between TRPC6 and IP3 receptor is already formed under basal conditions and is not enhanced by stimulation of the cells. No IP3 receptor type 3 immunoreactivity was shown to partition with caveolin-1/2 in HEK 293 cells that did not overexpress TRPC6 (Fig. 1B). These results show that both TRPC6 and IP3 receptor type 3 were present in the CRM and that their presence was TRPC6 expression-dependent. Because caveolae are involved in protein trafficking after cell stimulation, we assessed TRPC6 levels in the plasma membrane during stimulation with different agents known to increase Ca2+ entry. Cell surface proteins were selectively biotinylated with the membrane-impermeant amino reagent sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. The proteins were then solubilized and incubated with streptavidin-agarose before immunoblotting with anti-TRPC6 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, biotinylated TRPC6 was barely detectable under basal conditions. After stimulation with 1 μm CCh TRPC6 levels in the plasma membrane increased substantially. Stimulation with 0.5 μm thapsigargin or 100 μm 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), a diacylglycerol analogue known to activate TRPC6, also increased TRPC6 levels in the plasma membrane of T6.11 cells. Similar results were obtained by immunofluorescent staining of the cells using a TRPC6-specific antibody (Fig. 2B). Under basal conditions, diffuse TRPC6 staining was observed throughout the cell. After stimulation with thapsigargin or CCh, a marked difference in the staining pattern occurred and prominent, uniformly distributed staining was observed at the cell surface. Under basal conditions, TRPC6 cell surface staining was seen in less than 12% of the cells, whereas between 40 and 60% were positive after thapsigargin or CCh stimulation (Fig. 2C). The reversibility of CCh-induced externalization of TRPC6 was assessed by removing the CCh after the initial 1-min stimulation at 37 °C and adding the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine, for 15 min before the biotinylation reaction. As shown previously, the level of TRPC6 at the plasma membrane increased during the first min of stimulation with CCh (Fig. 3, second lane versus first lane). After a 15-min incubation with atropine, the level of TRPC6 at the plasma membrane returned to the basal level (Fig. 3, fourth lane versus third and first lanes). These results suggest that the stimulation of the cells with a Gq protein-coupled receptor agonist induced the externalization of TRPC6, which quickly returned to an intracellular compartment when the stimulation was removed. Regulated exocytosis mechanisms are often dependent on the presence of Ca2+, which is essential for the merging of vesicles with the plasma membrane. CCh-induced TRPC6 externalization was measured in BAPTA-AM-loaded cells to investigate the role of [Ca2+]i in TRPC6 externalization. As shown in Fig. 4, chelating cytosolic Ca2+ with BAPTA alone was enough to cause the externalization of TRPC6 at levels similar to CCh-induced TRPC6 externalization. Stimulation of BAPTA-AM-loaded cells with 1 μm CCh increased TRPC6 externalization even more. These results suggest that TRPC6 externalization did not require an increase in [Ca2+]i.Fig. 4Cytosolic Ca2+-independent externalization of TRPC6. HEK T6.11 cells were preincubated for 20 min in the absence (first and second lanes) or presence of 50 μm BAPTA-AM (third and fourth lanes) followed by a de-esterification step (washing and incubating in fresh HBSS for 20 min at room temperature) and then incubated for 1 min in the absence (basal; first and third lanes) or presence of 1 μm CCh for 1 min (second and fourth lanes). The cells were then chilled, biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, lysed, and incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A representative Western blot of streptavidin-agarose precipitates stained with an anti-TRPC6 antibody is shown (top). Aliquots of cell lysates were taken before the incubation with streptavidin-agarose and analyzed directly by Western blotting to determine the total amount of TRPC6 in the samples (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ca2+ entry into cells usually occurs within the first minute after IP3-induced Ca2+ release. To investigate whether CCh-induced TRPC6 externalization occurs simultaneously with Ca2+ entry, T6.11 cells were incubated with 1 μm CCh for various periods before biotinylation. As shown in Fig. 5A, the appearance of TRPC6 at the plasma membrane could be detected in as soon as 5 s after CCh stimulation. After reaching a peak at 30 s, the level of TRPC6 at the plasma membrane remained elevated for 15 min. To determine the rate of Ca2+ entry into T6.11 HEK cells, the CCh-induced Ca2+ transient was measured in fura 2/AM-loaded cells in the absence and presence of extracellular Ca2+. Ca2+ entry into T6.11 HEK cells could be detected within 30 s and reached a peak at 60-90 s after CCh stimulation (Fig. 5B). Ca2+ entry was sustained as long as the CCh was present. These results suggest that the rapid translocation of TRPC6 to the plasma membrane after CCh stimulation precedes Ca2+ entry. We next verified whether the CCh dose-dependent effect was the same for TRPC6 externalization and Ca2+ entry. T6.11 cells were incubated for 2 min with increasing concentrations of CCh before the biotinylation assay (Fig. 6A). The threshold concentration of CCh that induced TRPC6 externalization was ∼0.01 μm, and the maximal effect was obtained with 10 μm CCh. A half-maximal effect (EC50) occurred at a CCh concentration of 0.3 μm. The CCh dose-dependent effect on Ca2+ entry was measured 2 min after the addition of increasing concentrations of CCh. As shown previously (Fig. 5B, inset), the [Ca2+]i level reached after 2 min of stimulation with CCh was mostly dependent on the Ca2+ entry component. Fig. 6B shows that the threshold concentration of CCh that induced Ca2+ entry was ∼0.1 μm and that the maximal effect was obtained with 100 μm CCh. Half-maximal Ca2+ entry (EC50) occurred at a CCh concentration of 1.0 μm. These results suggest that TRPC6 externalization occurs in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 value lower than that for Ca2+ entry. Numerous studies have shown that TRPC channels play an important role in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ in a wide variety of cell types. Various hypotheses have been proposed, but there is as yet no clear picture of the molecular mechanisms that link receptor activation to the opening of TRPC channels. In the study presented here, we showed that a significant proportion of the TRPC6 stably expressed in HEK 293 cells was associated with CRMs. CRMs, like caveolae, have the intrinsic capacity to concentrate many proteins that play an important role in signal transduction (37Couet J. Belanger M.M. Roussel E. Drolet M.C. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001; 49: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Our observation that TRPC6 was associated with CRMs is consistent with the results of other studies that reported the presence of TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4 in caveolae (this study; Refs. 22Lockwich T.P.

The sensors and regulators of these signals have been characterized individually. The ATP-sensitive K+ channel, acting as the ATP sensor, couples cell metabolism to membrane potential. cAMP-GEFII, acting as a cAMP sensor, mediates cAMP-dependent, protein kinase A-independent exocytosis, which requires interaction with both Piccolo as a Ca2+ sensor and Rim2 as a Rab3 effector. l-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) regulate Ca2+ influx. In the present study, we demonstrate interactions of these molecules. Sulfonylurea receptor 1, a subunit of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, interacts specifically with cAMP-GEFII through nucleotide-binding fold 1, and the interaction is decreased by a high concentration of cAMP. Localization of cAMP-GEFII overlaps with that of Rim2 in plasma membrane of insulin-secreting MIN6 cells. Localization of Rab3 co-incides with that of Rim2. Rim2 mutant lacking the Rab3 binding region, when overexpressed in MIN6 cells, is localized exclusively in cytoplasm, and impairs cAMP-dependent exocytosis in MIN6 cells. In addition, Rim2 and Piccolo bind directly to the α11.2-subunit of VDCC. These results indicate that ATP sensor, cAMP sensor, Ca2+ sensor, and VDCC interact with each other, which further suggests that ATP, cAMP, and Ca2+ signals in insulin granule exocytosis are integrated in a specialized domain of pancreatic β cells to facilitate stimulus-secretion coupling.

Scheller R.H. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).

Physiol. 1999; 61: 753-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In most secretory cells, the exocytotic process is triggered by an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). In neurons, elevation of [Ca2+]i results from opening the VDCCs localized in the so-called active zone, a specialized region where synaptic vesicles dock and fuse (4Landis D.M. J. Electron Microsc.

The pancreatic β cell is a typical endocrine cell, in which exocytosis of insulin-containing vesicles is regulated by various intracellular signals. ATP, cAMP, and Ca2+ are the major intracellular signals in the regulation of insulin secretion (19Zawalich W.S. Rasmussen H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 70: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Physiologically, the glucose concentration is the most important determinant of insulin secretion. Glucose stimulation increases the ATP concentration, which closes the KATP channels, depolarizing the β cell membrane and opening l-type VDCCs, allowing Ca2+ influx and triggering exocytosis of insulin granules. The pancreatic β cell KATP channel comprises two subunits, pore-forming Kir6.2, a member of the inward rectifier K+ channel family, and the regulatory subunit SUR1, a receptor of the sulfonylureas widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (20Seino S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 337-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Studies of Kir6.2 and SUR1-knockout mice demonstrate that the KATP channel, acting as an ATP sensor, acts as a key molecule by coupling cell metabolism to membrane potential in glucose-induced insulin secretion (21Miki T.

In addition, l-type VDCCs are known to regulate Ca2+ influx into pancreatic β cells.

A fragment containing the α11.2-subunit (745–892) or α11.3-subunit (773–907) of l-type VDCC was subcloned in pGBKT7 vector (Clontech) as Myc-tagged protein. Pull-down Assays—For cosedimentation assays, COS-1 cells were transfected with each plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Transfected COS-1 cells or mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells were sonicated in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The cellular lysates were incubated with 1 μg of MBP or GST-fused protein immobilized on amylose- or glutathione-resin for 90 min at 4 °C. The washed complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the IgG-purified anti-cAMP-GEFII antibody (27Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cel. Bio. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), or anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). GST-fused Piccolo-C2A, Piccolo-C2B, Rim2-C2A, and Rim2C2B proteins immobilized on glutathione-resin were incubated with fragments of α11.2-subunit (745–892) or α11.3-subunit (773–907) produced by in vitro translation (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The washed complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-Myc antibody. Subcellular Fractionation—MIN6 cells lysed with hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were used. The lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min to remove nuclear fractions. The supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h and collected as cytosolic fractions. The pellet (membrane fraction) was suspended with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was sonicated for 30 s twice on ice and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was collected as a membrane extract fraction. Each fraction was subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-cAMP-GEFII antibody and anti-Rim2 antibody raised against Rim2 peptide (amino acid residues 348–365). Sucrose gradient fractionation of MIN6 cells was performed as described previously (27Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cel. Bio. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Briefly, MIN6 cells were harvested by homogenization buffer containing 200 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1770 × g for 6 min at 4 °C. The resulting postnuclear supernatant was applied to the top of gradients of sucrose steps (0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.4, or 1.8 m sucrose in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 2 mm EGTA), and centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The fractions were collected from the top to the bottom, precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-Rim2 antibody, anti Na+-K+-ATPase α-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-Rab3 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and anti-VAMP-2 antibody (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.). Measurement of C-peptide Secretion—MIN6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum under a humidified condition of 95% air and 5% CO2. MIN6 cells were transfected with human preproinsulin expression vector plus pCMV-luciferase, pCMV-Myc-Rim2ΔN, or pCMV-Myc-Rim2ΔC2. As a control, luciferase was used. Three days after transfection, the C-peptide secretory response to 1 mm of 8-bromo-cAMP (8-bromoadenosine 3′,5′ cyclic monophosphate) (Sigma) in the presence of glucose (16.7 mm) for 60 min was evaluated by human C-peptide released into medium. Human C-peptide was measured by human C-peptide RIA kit (Linco Research Inc., St. Charles, MO). Immunocytochemistry—MIN6 cells were transfected with pCMV-Myc-full-length Rim2 and Rim2ΔN. The cultured cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature and thoroughly rinsed with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline. After the samples were pretreated with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 10% normal donkey serum, they were incubated with rabbit anti-Myc antibody and mouse anti-Rab3 antibody, followed by Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), respectively. The sections were mounted with coverslips using PourmaFlour (Immunon, Pittsburgh, PA) and observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM410, Carl Zeiss, Tokyo). Specific Interaction of SUR1 and cAMP-GEFII—In our search for a molecule directly modulating KATP channel activity, we previously performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of the MIN6 cDNA library using a partial SUR1 as bait and found that cAMP-GEFII (amino acid residues 186–729) bound to NBF-1 of SUR1 (598–1003) (27Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cel. Bio. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Because the NBF is conserved in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family, we examined cAMP-GEFII binding to other ABC proteins. MBP-fused proteins with SUR1-NBF-2 (1299–1581), SUR2A-NBF-1 (589–963) (30Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M. Matsumoto S. Higashiguchi O. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24321-24324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), and MDR1-NBF-1 (347–710) (31Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar) were constructed. As shown in Fig. 1, FLAG-tagged full-length cAMP-GEFII expressed in COS-1 cells did not bind SUR1-NBF-2, SUR2A-NBF-1, or MDR1-NBF-1, indicating that cAMP-GEFII specifically binds to NBF-1 of SUR1. Binding of cAMP-GEFII and SUR1 Is Regulated by cAMP— Because cAMP induces conformational change of the protein kinase A regulatory subunit and cAMP-GEFII upon binding (32Su Y. Dostmann W.R.

Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), we investigated whether cAMP binding affects the interaction of SUR1 and cAMP-GEFII. MBP-SUR1-NBF-1 was incubated with lysate of MIN6 cells in 1 or 100 μm 8-bromo-cAMP to determine whether endogenous cAMP-GEFII in MIN6 cells interacts with SUR1-NBF-1 and if such an interaction is regulated by cAMP. Interaction between cAMP-GEFII and SUR1 is decreased by a high concentration (100 μm) of 8-bromo-cAMP (Fig. 2A). We also examined whether cAMP regulates the interaction of cAMP-GEFII with Rim2 or Piccolo. MIN6 cells treated with 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP were subjected to in vitro binding assay with GST-Rim2 (538–863) (27Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cel. Bio. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) or GST-Piccolo (4505–4758) (29Fujimoto K. Shibasaki T. Yokoi N. Kashima Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 50497-50502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) immobilized on glutathione resins. cAMP-GEFII formed a complex with both Rim2 (538–863) and Piccolo (4505–4758) both in the presence and in the absence of 1 mm 8-bromo-cAMP (Fig. 2B). These results show that endogenous cAMP-GEFII binds to SUR1 and suggests that cAMP inhibits interaction of SUR1 and cAMP-GEFII and does not affect the interaction of cAMP-GEFII and Rim2 or Piccolo. Protein Domains Responsible for Binding Rim2 and cAMP-GEFII—Both Rim1 and Rim2 have an amino (N)-terminal zinc finger domain, a PDZ domain, and two C2 domains. It has been suggested that Rim1 functions as a scaffolding protein, which interacts physically through these domains with Rab3, Munc13–1, Ca2+ channels, synaptotagmin I, and α-liprin (11Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 16Betz A. Thakur P. Junge H.J. Ashery U. Rhee J.S. Scheuss V. Rosenmund C.

Assuming that Rim2 also functions as a scaffolding protein in determining which region of Rim2 interacts with cAMP-GEFII, we constructed the various Rim2 deletion mutants shown in Fig. 3A and performed a GST pull-down assay. GST-fused proteins were incubated with lysates of MIN6 cells. Fig. 3B shows the interaction of endogenous cAMP-GEFII in MIN6 cells and Rim2 mutants. Although the Rim2 mutant (198–649) lacking a PDZ domain did not bind to cAMP-GEFII, the mutant having a PDZ domain (Rim2PDZ) bound to cAMP-GEFII, indicating that the PDZ domain contains the cAMP-GEFII binding region. The Rim2 mutant, in which the well conserved amino acids (Arg682, Leu688, and Gly689) critical for binding to PDZ-interacting protein (34Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are replaced with alanines, did not bind to endogenous cAMP-GEFII in MIN6 cells (Fig. 3C). This further confirms that the PDZ domain of Rim2 is responsible for binding to cAMP-GEFII, using its mutants shown in Fig. 3D. All cAMP-GEFII mutants lacking the carboxyl (C)-terminal region bound to Rim2PDZ, but the cAMP-GEFII mutant lacking the N-terminal region (residues 291–1011) did not (Fig. 3E). These results show that cAMP-GEFII, through its N-terminal region, binds to the PDZ domain of Rim2. Subcellular Localization of cAMP-GEFII and Rim2—Localization of cAMP-GEFII and Rim2 in MIN6 cells was examined using subcellular fractionation (Fig. 4A). cAMP-GEFII is localized both in cytosolic and membrane fractions, whereas Rim2 is localized almost exclusively in membrane fractions. Rim2 was also fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation from MIN6 cells (Fig. 4B). Rim2 is present in plasma membrane fractions (fractions 2 and 3; Na+-K+-ATPase α-1 as a marker) and large dense-core granule fractions (fractions 7 and 8; VAMP-2 is a marker). These results show that although the intracellular localizations of cAMP-GEFII and Rim2 differ, they overlap in the membrane fraction. The N Terminus of Rim2 Is Important for both Subcellular Localization and cAMP-dependent Exocytosis—The N-terminal regions of Rim1 and Rim2 have been shown to bind Rab3 (11Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 27Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cel. Bio. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). We examined the role of this region in subcellular localization using the N-terminal deletion mutant (Rim2ΔN) (Fig. 5A). Wild-type Rim2 transfected into MIN6 cells is localized with Rab3 in both insulin granules and plasma membrane. In contrast, Rim2ΔN is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm. Localization of Rim2ΔN is quite different from that of wild-type Rim2, indicating that the N terminus of Rim2 is critical in localization with the granules (Fig. 5B). We next examined the effect of Rim2ΔN on cAMP-dependent insulin secretion (Fig. 5C). Insulin secretion was monitored indirectly by measuring C-peptide secretion from MIN6 cells, and transfected with human preproinsulin cDNA as reported previously (27Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cel. Bio. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). cAMP-dependent C-peptide secretion from Rim2ΔN-transfected MIN6 cells was reduced significantly, compared with that from luciferase-transfected MIN6 cells (control). However, Rim2 mutant lacking C2 domains (Rim2ΔC2) did not inhibit cAMP-dependent C-peptide secretion. These results show that the interaction of Rim2 and Rab3 is required in cAMP-dependent insulin secretion. Both Piccolo and Rim2 Interact Directly withl-type VDCC— Because synaptotagmin I, which has a C2 domain, is known to interact with α-subunits of VDCC through their cytoplasmic loops which connect domains II and III, we examined whether Piccolo and Rim2, both of which have C2 domains, also interact with the α-subunit. The C2 domains of Piccolo bind directly to the cytoplasmic loop of the α11.2-subunit but not the α11.3-subunit of l-type VDCC (Fig. 6). Similarly, C2 domains of Rim2 bind directly to the α11.2-subunit but not to the α11.3-subunit. Stimulus-secretion coupling is a critical event in pancreatic β cells, where the KATP channel controls glucose-induced and sulfonylurea-induced insulin release. Pancreatic β cell KATP channels are composed of Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits, the poreforming subunit, and a regulatory subunit that primarily confers activation by MgADP, potassium channel openers, and inhibition by sulfonylureas, respectively. SUR1 also is required for the functional expression of the KATP channel at the cell surface (35Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). In our search for a molecule that interacted with NBF-1 of SUR1, we identified cAMP-GEFII (also referred to as Epac2) (27Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cel. Bio. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Because the NBF is conserved among ABC proteins, cAMP-GEFII might well bind to other ABC proteins. However, cAMP-GEFII did not bind to SUR1-NBF-2, SUR2A-NBF-1, or MDR1-NBF-1, indicating that cAMP-GEFII binds specifically to NBF-1 of SUR. In addition, cAMP-GEFII had no effect upon KATP channel activity under various conditions (data not shown). Accordingly, it is possible that SUR1 functions as a scaffolding protein as well as the regulatory subunit of the KATP channel. cAMP-GEFII has been shown to bind to Rim2 and Piccolo (27Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cel.

Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Although the PDZ domain of Piccolo was found to bind to cAMP-GEFII (29Fujimoto K. Shibasaki T. Yokoi N. Kashima Y. Matsumoto M. Sasaki T. Tajima N. Iwanaga T. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50497-50502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the region of Rim2 responsible for binding to cAMP-GEFII is not known. Using various Rim2 deletion mutants, we found that the PDZ domain of Rim2 is necessary for binding. These findings indicate that CAZ proteins having PDZ domains can form a complex with cAMP-GEFII. It is generally thought that the PDZ domain binds to consensus sequence E/D/S/T/ϕ-X-ϕ (where ϕ is a hydrophobic amino acid and X is any amino acid) of the C-terminal region of PDZ-interacting proteins (34Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, we find that cAMP-GEFII, through its N-terminal region that does not have such a consensus sequence, binds to the PDZ domain of Rim2, suggesting that cAMP-GEFII binds uniquely to the PDZ domain. As deletion of the C-terminal region with GEF activity toward Rap1 does not affect binding of cAMP-GEFII to either Rim2 or Piccolo, Rap1 is not involved. cAMP-GEFII has been shown to be responsible in cAMP-dependent, protein kinase A-independent exocytosis (27Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cel. Bio. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 28Kashima Y. Miki T. Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the effects of cAMP upon the binding of SUR1 and cAMP-GEFII and upon the binding of cAMP-GEFII and Rim2 or Piccolo. Interestingly, cAMP-GEFII and SUR1 binding is decreased by a high cAMP concentration. It has been shown also that cAMP binding to cAMP-GEFII induces its conformational change (33Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. De Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Such an alteration might dissociate cAMP-GEFII from SUR1 and induce the interaction of cAMP-GEFII and Rim2. We found that Ca2+ does not affect the binding of cAMP-GEFII to Rim2 or Piccolo. These results indicate that neither cAMP nor Ca2+ are factors in the binding of cAMP-GEFII and Rim2 or Piccolo. Analyses of the subcellular localizations of cAMP-GEFII and Rim2 show that they overlap at least in the plasma membrane. Piccolo also has been shown to be located in the plasma membrane in neurons (8Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Appeltauer U. Takei K. Kindler S. Veh R.W. De Camilli P. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 214-223PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that cAMP-GEFII interacts with Rim2 and Piccolo in the plasma membrane. The N-terminal region of Rim1 binds to Rab3, which is involved in Ca2+-triggered exocytosis (11Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). We find that deletion of the N-terminal region of Rim2 (Rim2ΔN) results in the loss of binding ability to Rab3 and that, unlike wild-type Rim2, Rim2ΔN is distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm; localization is also quite different from that of Rab3. Overexpression of Rim2ΔN in MIN6 cells shows that cAMP-dependent, Ca2+-triggered secretion is reduced significantly compared with control (wild-type Rim2-transfected MIN6 cells). This reduction probably occurs because Rim2ΔN cannot transduce the cAMP signal to Rab3-mediated exocytosis and/or cannot couple to the exocytotic machinery. We reported recently that Piccolo functions as a Ca2+ sensor in pancreatic β cells (29Fujimoto K. Shibasaki T. Yokoi N. Kashima Y. Matsumoto M. Sasaki T. Tajima N. Iwanaga T. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50497-50502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The present finding that deletion of the C2 domain of Rim2 does not affect cAMP-potentiated, Ca2+-triggered secretion supports this report. Synaptotagmin I, a Ca2+ sensor in neurons, interacts with the α12.1-subunit of P/Q-type VDCC (36Charvin N. L'Eveque C. Walker D. Berton F. Raymond C. Kataoka M. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. de Waard M. Seagar M.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4591-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and α12.2-subunit of N-type VDCC (37Sheng Z.H. Yokoyama C.T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5405-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, synaptotagmin I binds to the α11.2-subunit of l-type VDCC in pancreatic β cells (38Wiser O. Trus M. Hernandez A. Renstrom E. Barg S. Rorsman P. Atlas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Rim1 has also been shown to bind to α11.2-subunit through C2 domains (17Coppola T. Magnin-Luthi S. Perret-Menoud V. Gattesco S. Schiavo G. Regazzi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32756-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, whether or not Piccolo binds to VDCC was unknown. Our data indicate that Rim2 and Piccolo bind directly to α11.2-subunits through their C2 domains. Together, these findings clarify the link between Ca2+ sensors and l-type VDCCs in exocytosis of insulin granules. The l-type VDCCs are concentrated in the area of the pancreatic β cell that contains the insulin granules, suggesting that VDCCs and the granules are targeted to the same region in the pancreatic β cell and that the molecular organization is critical in regulated exocytosis within a zone of voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry (39Bokvist K. Eliasson L. Ammala C. Renstrom E. Rorsman P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Based on the present in vitro findings, we propose interactions of the KATP channel as an ATP sensor, cAMP-GEFII as a cAMP sensor, Piccolo as a Ca2+ sensor, and the l-type VDCC (Fig. 7). The KATP channel interacts specifically with cAMP-GEFII through NBF-1 of SUR1. The increase in cAMP concentration dissociates cAMP-GEFII from SUR1, inducing dimerization of Rim2 or Piccolo in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Rab3 links Rim2 to the insulin granules. Further studies are required to determine the spatial and temporal regulation of the interactions of these molecules in vivo. We thank T. Tanabe and K.

The small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: sHSPs, small heat shock proteins; strep, Strep-tag II; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. 1The abbreviations used are: sHSPs, small heat shock proteins; strep, Strep-tag II; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. and the structurally related vertebrate eye lens α-crystallins are a family of virtually ubiquitous stress proteins (1De Jong W.W.

Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Their role in cellular stress extends from protection against high temperature and oxidative stress to a potentially important function in a variety of protein-folding diseases and aging (3Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 4Hsu A.-L. Murphy C.T. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The sHSPs are defined by a conserved C-terminal domain of ∼90 amino acids (the α-crystallin domain), which is flanked by a variable length N-terminal arm and a more conserved C-terminal extension (1De Jong W.W. Caspers G.-J. Leunissen J.A.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 5Caspers G.-J. Leunissen J.A.M. De Jong W.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). These small proteins (16–42-kDa monomers) assemble into oligomeric structures of 9 to >32 subunits depending on the sHSP (6van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nature Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 7Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). sHSPs are very efficient at binding denatured proteins, and current models propose that they function as ATP-independent molecular chaperones to prevent irreversible protein aggregation and insolubilization (2van Montfort R.L.M. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). sHSP-bound proteins can be reactivated by the ATP-dependent chaperone activity of DnaK/Hsp70, with the help of ClpB or GroEL in some instances (8Lee G.J. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 9Mogk A. Schlieker C. Friedrich K.L. Schönfeld H.-J. Vierling E. Bukau B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, sHSPs are proposed to be a critical component of the cellular chaperone network that becomes particularly important under conditions of severe stress involving protein aggregation. Although the ability of sHSPs to interact with denatured model substrates in vitro has been studied extensively, the characteristics of cellular sHSP substrates remain poorly defined. Understanding the mechanism of sHSP chaperone action, as well as determining how these proteins may act to protect cells during stress, requires identification of proteins that interact with sHSPs in vivo, either as partners or substrates. Co-immunoprecipitation, two-hybrid analysis, and other techniques have been used to identify potential sHSP-interacting proteins in several systems (2van Montfort R.L.M. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 59: 105-156Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Such studies have identified a diversity of proteins suggested to associate with sHSPs. These include a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (11Zheng J. Luo W. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (12Joanisse D.R. Inaguma Y. Tanguay R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1460-1470PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrates, sHSPs are proposed to interact directly with actin and intermediate filament proteins, potentially altering the filament assembly/disassembly equilibrium of these cytoskeletal components (18Allen P.N. Noller H.F. Cell. 1991; 66: 141-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Miron T. Wilchek M. Geiger B. Eur. J.

Van den Ijssel P. Prescott A. Hutcheson A.M. Quinlan R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2099-2112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The idea that sHSPs might have multiple substrates is supported by observation in plants, yeast, and mammals, where there is evidence that many different proteins associate with sHSPs during heat stress (23Ehrnsperger M. Gräber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 24Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S.X. Saibil H.R. Buchner J.

However, none of these latter studies identified any of the interacting proteins. We are investigating sHSP function using a model genetic organism, the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (26Giese K. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Critical studies of sHSP function have been hampered by the lack of any or of easily assayed phenotypes associated with sHSP deletions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Escherichia coli (27Petko L. Lindquist S. Cell. 1985; 45: 885-894Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Mogk A. Deuerling E. Vorderwülbecke S. Vierling E. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The Synechocystis genome encodes a single sHSP, Hsp16.6, deletion of which leads to a conditional lethal phenotype after high temperature treatment (26Giese K. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Like other sHSPs, Hsp16.6 is oligomeric (∼20 subunits) and in vitro can facilitate refolding of bound denatured proteins in conjunction with the DnaK/Hsp70 chaperone system and, under some conditions, most likely also with the aid of ClpB (9Mogk A. Schlieker C. Friedrich K.L. Schönfeld H.-J. Vierling E. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31033-31042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 26Giese K. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We have used both immunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography to show that at least 42 proteins interact with Hsp16.6 in heat-stressed cells, 13 of which were subsequently identified by mass spectrometry. These proteins fit stringent criteria for being sHSP substrates, including specific interaction under heat stress conditions, ability to be released from Hsp16.6 by the DnaK system plus ATP, and heat lability. We also show that, in a purified system, one of these putative substrate proteins forms complexes with Hsp16.6 at high temperature. The proteins identified show no commonality in sequence or structure that could be a signature for an sHSP substrate. The range of functions of these putative substrate provides evidence that sHSPs are important for protection of multiple cell proteins and a wide variety of cellular activities, including translation, transcription, cell signaling, and secondary metabolism. Synechocystis Strains and Growth Conditions—Isogenic wild-type and hsp16.6 deletion (Δhsp16.6) strains carrying a spectinomycin resistance gene (aadA) were created as described previously (26Giese K. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46310-46318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 51Török Z. Goloubinoff P. Tsvetkova N.M. Glatz A. Balogh G. Varvasovszki V. Los D.A. Vierling E. Crowe J.H. Vigh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3098-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and all experiments specifying the wild type in this work were performed with this spectinomycin-resistant wild-type strain. A strain was also generated in which the wild-type hsp16.6 gene was replaced with an hsp16.6 gene engineered by PCR to include an 8-amino acid C-terminal Strep-tag II affinity tag (WSHPQFEK) (54Voss S. Skerra A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 55Schmidt T.G. Koepke J. Frank R. Skerra A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255 (T. G. M.): 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cells were propagated at 30 °C in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8)-buffered liquid BG-11 medium (56Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) supplemented with 5 mm glucose in a shaking culture under lights (∼12 microeinsteins/m2/s). Heat treatments were performed in the dark on cells in exponential growth phase as described for each experiment. For estimating cell viability, cells were serially diluted six times in BG-11 medium 10-fold, spotted onto BG-11 agar plates, and grown under light at 30 °C for 7 days. Purification of Hsp16.6 and Hsp16.6-strep—The coding region of hsp16.6 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (open reading frame sll1514) was subcloned into the NdeI and ApaI sites of the expression vector pJC20 (57Clos J. Brandau S. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) after engineering NdeI and ApaI sites at the initiation and termination codons of hsp16.6, respectively. The resulting plasmid was also modified by PCR to add a C-terminal Strep-tag II affinity tag (54Voss S. Skerra A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) to the hsp16.6 coding region. Recombinant Hsp16.6 and Hsp16.6-strep were both expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified to >95% homogeneity using the procedure described for recombinant pea HSP18.1 (58Lee G.J. Vierling E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 350-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were quantified using the extinction coefficient calculated from the amino acid composition. Protein Extraction—For protein analysis, cells were harvested by centrifugation for 4 min at 1100 × g and resuspended in cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 unit/ml potato apyrase (pH 7.5)) using 550 μl of buffer for each 25 ml of original culture. Cell suspensions were vortexed at the highest speed (6 × 30 s) in 1.7-ml tubes containing 0.4 ml of glass beads/0.5 ml of sample. Between vortexing cycles, tubes were cooled for 1 min on ice. Lysates were pipetted from the glass beads and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,250 × g, and then the soluble crude extracts were separated from the pellets. Protein concentration in cell extracts was quantified using the Bio-Rad reagent. The soluble lysate was used for immunoprecipitation or streptactin affinity chromatography or was analyzed directly by gel electrophoresis. For protein analysis of pellet fractions, pellets were washed 6 × 1.0 ml with lysis buffer minus apyrase, resuspended, and boiled in a volume of SDS sample buffer equal to that of the corresponding supernatant. Protein Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Synechocystis cells (50-ml cultures) were grown at 30 °Cto A730 = 0.15, given a prestress at 42 °C for 2 h, and then returned to 30 °C. Proteins were radioactively labeled by addition of 4 μCi/ml [35S]Met (Expre35S35S, 1175 Ci/mmol [35S]Met; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to cell cultures 1 h after the cells were returned to 30 °C. After another 11 h of growth at 30 °C, the culture was split, and one-half was kept at 30 °C, whereas the other half was heat-treated for 20 min at 46 °C. Soluble crude cell extracts containing ∼100,000 cpm [35S]Met/μg of protein in 450 μl were incubated with immune or preimmune anti-Hsp16.6 IgG bound to protein A-agarose (Repligen) for 2 h at 4 °C on an end-over-end rotator. Precipitates were washed 5 × 1 ml with lysis buffer lacking protease inhibitors and apyrase and then 2 × 1 ml with 25 mm HEPES and 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). Samples were resuspended and boiled in SDS sample buffer, separated on SDS-10–17% acrylamide gels, and visualized by fluorography. As a negative control, Δhsp16.6 cells were identically treated, and an additional sample was prepared from the deletion cells by addition of purified recombinant Hsp16.6 or Hsp16.6-strep (protein weight equal to 0.25% of the total protein in the sample) to the resuspended, heat-shocked cells prior to lysis and immunoprecipitation. Protein Release with DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE—E. coli DnaK and DnaJ were expressed and purified as described (59Zylicz M. Ang D. Liberek K. Georgopolous C. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1601-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 60Cegielska A. Georgopolous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21122-21130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli GrpE was purchased from Stressgen Biotech Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Radiolabeled proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous Hsp16.6 as described above. Immunoprecipitates were equilibrated in refolding buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 2.0 mm dithiothreitol) plus 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with or without supplementation with 2 mm ATP and the DnaK system (1 μm DnaK, 0.2 μm DnaJ, and 0.4 μm GrpE; 80 μl total) in 0.65-ml siliconized tubes. Reactions were placed at 30 °C. At time points over 60 min, samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 5 s to sediment protein A resin, and 1 μl of supernatant was monitored by scintillation counting for radioactivity. After 60 min, the remaining supernatant was removed, and the resin was washed with 200 μl of 25 mm HEPES and 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) and then boiled in 80 μl of SDS sample buffer. Equal volumes of supernatant and resin-bound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Streptactin Affinity Chromatography—The strain in which the hsp16.6-strep gene was substituted for the wild-type gene was grown in a 50-ml culture to A730 = ∼0.15 and subjected to heat stress or control conditions as described above for the radioactive labeling experiments. The cells were suspended in lysis buffer minus apyrase, but with 1 mm EDTA, and lysed as described above. The soluble fraction was mixed with 30 μl of the streptactin resin (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed, and bound proteins were eluted and analyzed as described for immunoprecipitation. Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was performed according to standard protocols, using 10–17% acrylamide gradient gels to maximize resolution. For two-dimensional gels, immunoprecipitated proteins were extracted with 1× SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 150 mm Tris (pH 8.8), 160 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, and 1 mm benzamidine) and then precipitated with 5× 0.1 m ammonium acetate in methanol (v/v) overnight at –20 °C. The precipitates were centrifuged for 15 min at 16,250 × g and washed twice with ammonium acetate in methanol and then twice with ice-cooled acetone. The air-dried pellets were dissolved in rehydration buffer (9.0 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 2% IPG buffer pH 3–10 NL (Amersham Biotech), and 3 mg/ml dithiothreitol). The pH 3–10 NL first dimension strips (13 cm; Amersham Biotech) were then rehydrated overnight at room temperature using 250 μl of sample in rehydration buffer. Focusing was carried out for 2 h at 150 V, 2 h at 300 V, 5 h at 500 V, and 7 h at 3500 V. The second dimension was run on SDS-11–17% polyacrylamide gels for 30 min at 15 mA and then for 7 h at 25 mA. Silver staining was performed according to Rabilloud et al. (61Rabilloud T. Carpentier G. Tarroux P. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Identification of Proteins by Mass Spectrometry—The total insoluble protein fraction prepared as described for immunoprecipitation samples (from 50 ml of heat-stressed cells) was separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue. Polypeptides identified as heat-associated with Hsp16.6 and released by DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE were excised from the gel and subjected to trypsin digestion according to Shevchenko et al. (62Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7734) Google Scholar). Digested samples were cleaned and concentrated on C18 ZipTip (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and mixed 1–3:1 in α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Mass analysis was performed on a Bruker Reflex-III MALDI-TOF instrument (Bruker-Daltronics, Inc.) using internal standards that improved mass accuracy over the mass range of m/z 904–2465, with 10–30 ppm error observed. Peptide mass matching for protein identification was performed using the Protein Prospector program at University of California, San Francisco. 2Available at prospector.ucsf.edu/. The identification was performed with the NCBnr Database. The search was done with no restriction of molecular mass, pI, or organism. The following criteria were used for identification: the error was kept under 50 ppm, and identified peptides covered at least 19% of the identified protein. Western Blotting—Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was prepared against purified recombinant Hsp16.6 by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA) and used at a dilution of 1:1000. For Western analysis of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase and heme oxygenase, rabbit polyclonal antisera were obtained against Synechocystis ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase from Dr. H. C. P. Matthijs (University of Amsterdam) and against heme oxygenase from Dr. S. I. Beale (Brown University). Serum was used at a dilution of 1:1000 for both antisera. Antibody reactions were visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biotech). Cloning and Purification of Soluble Serine Esterase—The coding sequence for serine esterase (open reading frame sll1284) was amplified from Synechocystis genomic DNA by PCR using primers 5′-TGTACATATGGCTCTACATTTTTCGGCG-3′ and 5′-TCGAGAATTCTCAACTCAAAAAAGACTTTAAG-3′. The resulting 632-bp fragment was cloned into expression vector pET28b (Novagen, Madison, WI) with NdeI and EcoRI to incorporate an N-terminal His tag and was confirmed by sequence analysis. Protein expression was carried out in BL21(DE3) cells grown in LB broth at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6 and induced for 4 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells from 2 liters of culture were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 300 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 400 mm NaCl (Buffer A) and lysed with a French press, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble serine esterase, which was only a small percentage of the total expressed protein, was retained on a Talon metal affinity column (Clontech), washed with Buffer A plus 10 mm imidazole, and then eluted in Buffer A plus 500 mm imidazole. The eluate was precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation followed by centrifugation, resuspended in a minimum volume of Buffer A, and applied to a Sephacryl S-100 HR column equilibrated in the same buffer. Fractions containing pure serine esterase were selected after SDS-PAGE and pooled. Mass spectrometry of the purified enzyme gave a mass of 24,233.9 Da, consistent with the theoretical mass without the N-terminal Met residue (24,241.4 Da). Approximately 1 mg of soluble serine esterase was obtained from 2 liters of culture. Aggregation Prevention and Complex Formation of Serine Esterase with Hsp16.6 —The ability of Hsp16.6 to suppress temperature-dependent insolubilization of serine esterase was tested by incubating serine esterase at 10 μm in the presence of 0, 0.5, 5.0, or 20 μm Hsp16.6 or the mass equivalent quantity of bovine serum albumin either at room temperature or at 46 °C for 20 or 60 min. Reactions were carried out in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.8) and 75 mm NaCl in 1.5-ml siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge. For supernatant samples, 70 μl of supernatant was removed from each mixture. The pellet was then washed with 1 ml of buffer; and after centrifugation, 960 μl of wash was removed, and the remainder of the sample comprised the pellet samples. Size-exclusion chromatography was used to confirm a physical association of serine esterase and Hsp16.6. Samples (100 μl) with 10 μm serine esterase and/or 20 μm Hsp16.6 were prepared as described above, held at room temperature or heated for 20 or 60 min at 46 °C, and centrifuged as described above. Supernatant (70 μl) was injected onto a Bio-Sil SEC400 column (Bio-Rad) on a Rainin Instrument high pressure liquid chromatography system. The column was equilibrated in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.8) and 75 mm NaCl and run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 25 °C while absorbance was recorded at 220 nm. Induction of Thermotolerance and Accumulation of Hsp16.6 —To establish conditions under which to examine Hsp16.6 interactions with other proteins in vivo, we first characterized the growth of Synechocystis isogenic wild-type and Δhsp16.6 strains and determined the levels of Hsp16.6 after heat treatment in liquid culture. The isogenic wild-type and deletion strains had the same growth rate at the 30 °C optimum growth temperature. Although maximum levels of Hsp16.6 accumulated after 60–120 min at 42 °C (data not shown), this treatment did not affect cell viability in wild-type Hsp16.6 or the Δhsp16.6 mutant (data not shown). These results are consistent with previous studies of Synechocystis wild-type Hsp16.6 and an Hsp16.6 insertional mutant (29Lee S. Prochaska D.J. Fang F. Barnum S.R. Curr. Microbiol. 1998; 37: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Horváth I. Glatz A. Varvasovszki V. Török Z. Pali T. Balogh G. Kovacs E. Nádasdi L. Benkovic S. Joo B. Vigh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3513-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A 42 °C treatment for 120 min was therefore chosen as a pretreatment to allow accumulation of Hsp16.6 for experiments aimed at examining interactions of the sHSP with other proteins. Temperature treatments that revealed phenotypic differences between the wild-type and Δhsp16.6 strains in liquid culture were determined, and the solubility of Hsp16.6 under the same conditions was examined. The effect of a 120-min pretreatment at 42 °C on subsequent survival of a more severe 46 °C treatment was investigated (Fig. 1). A 46 °C treatment (0–90 min) was applied 12 h after the pretreatment (approximately one cell generation), during which time the cells were grown at 30 °C to provide time for uniform protein labeling with isotopic amino acids in subsequent experiments. Strain viabilities from a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 1B. A difference in viability between the wild-type and deletion strains became apparent after 40 min at 46 °C; and after 90 min, the wild-type strain had approximately an order of magnitude greater viability than the deletion strain. By 120 min, the difference in viability typically increased to >3 orders of magnitude (data not shown). The same ∼10-fold difference in viability was seen when cells were placed directly at 46 °C after the 42 °C treatment or when cells were allowed to recover for 5, 6.5, or 12 h before the 46 °C treatment. Thus, Hsp16.6 makes a significant contribution to the acquisition of cellular thermotolerance under these conditions. The level and solubility of Hsp16.6 over the course of the experiment were then examined. Total cell proteins were extracted in immunoprecipitation buffer, and soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation. Hsp16.6 was not detected in the wild-type cells grown at 30 °C, but significant levels accumulated in a soluble form after the 42 °C pretreatment (Fig. 1C). When the cells were returned to their normal 30 °C growth temperature, Hsp16.6 levels remained fairly constant for up to 24 h. Maximum accumulation of Hsp16.6 was determined to represent 0.5% of the total cell protein by Western analysis of purified Hsp16.6 compared with protein from heat-stressed cells (data not shown). If cells were then restressed at the higher temperature of 46 °C for 20 min, there was no significant increase in the level of Hsp16.6, and about one-half of the pre-existing Hsp16.6 remained soluble, whereas the rest was recovered in the pellet fraction. Longer treatment at 46 °C did not significantly increase the fraction of insoluble Hsp16.6 (data not shown). These stress conditions, which allowed accumulation of soluble Hsp16.6 and under which the presence of Hsp16.6 led to significant protection of viability, were chosen for further study of Hsp16.6 interaction with cell proteins. Numerous Synechocystis Proteins Co-immunoprecipitate with Hsp16.6 in Cells Treated at High Temperature—We next sought to determine whether Hsp16.6 shows a temperature-dependent interaction with any endogenous Synechocystis proteins, as would be predicted by the chaperone model for sHSP activity. As described above (Fig. 1A), exponentially growing wild-type cells were heat-stressed for 120 min at 42 °C to allow accumulation of Hsp16.6, returned to 30 °C, and grown in the presence of [35S]Met for 11 h. Radiolabeled cell cultures were divided in half, and one aliquot was maintained at 30 °C (conditioned cells), whereas the other aliquot was restressed at 46 °C for 20 min (heat-stressed cells). The short 46 °C treatment was chosen to minimize effects due to death of a large numbe"
https://openalex.org/W1977807736,"Beta-catenin is an essential element for the transcriptional activation of target genes in the Wnt signaling cascade and is also a cell adhesion molecule that couples with cadherins. Although plakoglobin (gamma-catenin), a closely related homologue of beta-catenin, is also known to be a cell adhesion molecule, its function as a transcriptional factor has not been revealed in detail. Using a human malignant mesothelioma cell line, NCI-H28, in which we have identified a homozygous deletion of the beta-catenin gene, we studied whether plakoglobin has a T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family-dependent transcriptional activity. Transfection with the wild-type plakoglobin expression vector induced accumulation of plakoglobin in the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation assay with cotransfection of plakoglobin and either TCF-4 or LEF-1 detected binding of plakoglobin to TCF-4 or LEF-1. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated transcriptional activity of the wild-type plakoglobin when transfected with TCF/LEF, although plakoglobin showed less activity than beta-catenin. Exogenous plakoglobin was also shown to promote entrance of exogenous beta-catenin into the nuclei. Furthermore, small interfering RNA directed against plakoglobin suppressed expression of endogenous plakoglobin and its transcriptional activity, suggesting that endogenous plakoglobin has a weak transcriptional activity. These results suggest that plakoglobin can activate the Wnt signaling cascade directly without interaction of beta-catenin, and that plakoglobin has multiple functions as a transcriptional activator and a cell adhesion molecule like beta-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W2094606078,"Since 1933, carbonic anhydrase research has focused on enzymes from mammals (α class) and plants (β class); however, two additional classes (γ and δ) were discovered recently. Cam, from the procaryote Methanosarcina thermophila, is the prototype of the γ class and the first carbonic anhydrase to be characterized from either an anaerobic organism or the Archaea domain. All of the enzymes characterized from the four classes have been purified aerobically and are reported to contain a catalytic zinc. Herein, we report the anaerobic reconstitution of apo-Cam with Fe2+, which yielded Cam with an effective kcat that exceeded that for the Zn2+-reconstituted enzyme. Mössbauer spectroscopy showed that the Fe2+-reconstituted enzyme contained high spin Fe2+ that, when oxidized to Fe3+, inactivated the enzyme. Reconstitution with Fe3+ was unsuccessful. Reconstitution with Cu2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, or Cd2+ yielded enzymes with effective kcat values that were 10% or less than the value for the Zn2+-reconstituted Cam. Cam produced in Escherichia coli and purified anaerobically contained iron with effective kcat and kcat/Km values exceeding the values for Zn2+-reconstituted Cam. The results identify a previously unrecognized biological function for iron.

Roughton F.J.W. J. Physiol. 1933; 80: 113-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). CO2+H2O=HCO3+H+ Research in the intervening years has shown that CA is one of the most widely distributed enzymes in nature (2Smith K.S. Jakubzick C. Whittam T.C. Ferry J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15184-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 3Hewett-Emmett D. Chegwidden W.R. Carter N.D. Edwards Y.H. The Carbonic Anhydrases. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2000: 29-76Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and continues to be intensely investigated. Amino acid sequence comparisons identify four classes (α, β, γ, and δ) of independent origins (4Tripp B.C. Smith K. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48615-48618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Isozymes of the α class are found in virtually all mammalian tissues where they function in diverse essential processes. The β class is ubiquitous in plants and algae, where it is indispensable for the acquisition and concentration of CO2 for photosynthesis. CA plays a role in the sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in carbonates, and the global cycles of silicon and carbon are linked by CA in diatoms (5Milligan A.J. Morel F.M. Science. 2002; 297: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); thus, CA plays an important role in major geochemical and atmospheric processes. Members of the β and γ classes are wide spread in physiologically diverse procaryotes from both the Bacteria and Archaea domains. Indeed, the genome of Escherichia coli contains two γ class homologs and two β class homologs (2Smith K.S. Jakubzick C. Whittam T.C. Ferry J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15184-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).Cam, from the procaryote Methanosarcina thermophila, is the prototype of the γ class and the first CA to be characterized from either an anaerobic organism or the Archaea domain (6Alber B.E. Ferry J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6909-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses approximate the evolution of the γ class at the estimated time of the origin of life (2Smith K.S. Jakubzick C. Whittam T.C. Ferry J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15184-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Cam purified aerobically from E. coli reveals a homotrimer with a subunit fold composed of a left-handed β-helix motif followed by short and long α-helix structures (7Kisker C. Schindelin H. Alber B.E. Ferry J.G. Rees D.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2323-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Each of the three active sites contain three histidines that coordinate a zinc ion. Two of the metal-binding histidines are donated by one monomer, and the third histidine from an adjacent monomer. Other residues in the active site of Cam are also donated from adjacent monomer faces and bear no resemblance to residues in the active site of the well characterized α class CAs for which specific functions have been assigned.Kinetic investigations of the α class CAs reveal a “zinc hydroxide” mechanism for catalysis (8Lindskog S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) that also extends to both the β and γ classes (9Rowlett R.S. Chance M.R. Wirt M.D. Sidelinger D.E. Royal J.R. Woodroffe M.

The overall enzyme-catalyzed reaction occurs in two mechanistically distinct steps, E-Zn2+-OH-+CO2⇄E-Zn2+-HCO3-(Eq. 2) E-Zn2+-HCO3-+H2O⇄E-Zn2+-H2O+HCO3-(Eq. 3) E-Zn2+-H2O⇄+H-E-Zn2+-OH-(Eq. 4) +H-E-Zn2+-OH-+B⇄E-Zn2+-OH-+BH+(Eq. 5) where E is enzyme, and B is buffer. The first step is the interconversion between CO2 and bicarbonate (Equations 2 and 3) involving a nucleophilic attack of the zinc-bound hydroxyl on the CO2 molecule. The second step is regeneration of the zinc-bound hydroxide, which involves intramolecular proton transfer from the zinc-bound water to a proton shuttle residue (Equation 4) and intermolecular proton transfer to an accepting buffer molecule in the surrounding media (Equation 5). Kinetic analyses of site-specific replacement variants of Cam have identified essential residues (11Tripp B.C. Tu C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Tripp B.C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9232-9240Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).All of the biochemically characterized CAs from the α, β, and γ classes are categorically described as zinc metalloenzymes; however, there are few reports investigating the role of metals other than zinc. Although in vitro replacement of zinc with cobalt in a few purified CAs from the α and γ classes yields robustly active enzymes (10Alber B.E. Colangelo C.M. Dong J. Stålhandske C.M.V. Baird T.T.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9054-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether any cobalt-containing CAs are synthesized in vivo. A CA from the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii contains cadmium (15Lane T.W. Morel F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4627-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), although there are no reports of a biochemical or structural characterization of the purified enzyme. In most cases, CAs are hyperproduced in E. coli cultured in medium supplemented with Zn2+ and purified aerobically with buffers containing Zn2+. Clearly, these procedures have the potential to bias the incorporation of Zn2+ in vivo during synthesis of the enzyme or by in vitro exchange of another metal for Zn2+ during purification. In particular, a role for iron in any CA has not been adequately investigated. Herein we show that replacement of zinc in Cam with ferrous iron yields an enzyme with effective kcat values exceeding zinc-containing Cam, identifying a previously unrecognized biological function for iron.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzyme Purification—Hyperproduction of Cam in E. coli BL21(DE) was as described (16Alber B.E. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3270-3274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except where indicated the growth medium was supplemented with either 0.01% ferric ammonium citrate or 0.5 mm ZnSO4. Cam was purified as described (11Tripp B.C. Tu C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) except, where indicated, anaerobically utilizing an inert atmosphere glove bag (Coy Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI) and buffers that were rendered O2-free by vacuum degassing and replacement with N2. After the final purification step, the fractions containing Cam were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), placed in aliquots, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C until further use. When purified anaerobically, no metals were added to the buffers, and all solutions were treated with Chelex-100 resin (Bio-Rad). In addition, all of the glassware was acid-washed and rinsed with Chelex-treated water.Preparation of apo-Cam and Metal Reconstitution—In contrast to α class carbonic anhydrases (14Hunt J.A. Ahmed M. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9054-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the Cam active site metal cannot be readily removed by dialysis with chelators such as dipicolinate. Thus, Cam (10–50 mg/ml) was unfolded to allow removal of existing metals by chelation and then refolded to produce apo-Cam that was subsequently reconstituted with the indicated metals. Purified Cam (10–50 mg/ml) was incubated in 50-ml polyethylene centrifuge tubes at 4 °C for 16 h in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.5) containing 4.0 m spectroscopic grade guanidine hydrochloride (Fisher) and 50 mm dipicolinate. All of the buffers were treated with Chelex-100 resin to remove transition metal ions. The metal-free unfolded protein was then transferred into metal-free Spectra/Por 7 MWCO8000 tubing (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA) and dialyzed three times for 24 h at 4 °C against 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm KCl, 25 mm dipicolinate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The dipicolinate and dithiothreitol were then removed from the refolded apo-Cam by 3× dialysis against 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm KCl for 24 h at 4 °C. The apo-Cam was reconstituted with the indicated metals by dialysis twice for 24 h with 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm KCl and either 200 μm ZnSO4, 200 μm CdSO4, 200 μm CuSO4, 200 μm FeSO4, 200 μm FeCl3, 2 mm CoSO4, 2 mm NiSO4, 2 mm MgSO4, or 2 mm MnSO4. A competitive dialysis experiment was also performed anaerobically using 200 μm CoSO4, 200 μm FeSO4, and 200 μm ZnSO4. The reconstituted enzymes were subjected to size exclusion chromatography with a Superose 75 (Amersham Biosciences) column developed with Chelex-treated 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm KCl to remove misfolded protein aggregates. Reconstitutions of apo-Cam with FeSO4 and size exclusion chromatography of the reconstituted enzymes were performed in the anaerobic glove bag at 25 °C. The reconstituted enzymes were placed in aliquots, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C.Analytical—Cam preparations were analyzed for metals (aluminum, boron, barium, calcium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, sodium, nickel, phosphorus, lead, silicon, strontium, and zinc) by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrophotometry using a Jarrell-Ash 965 ICP instrument at the Chemical Analysis Laboratory of the University of Georgia. Circular dichroism spectra were collected on an AVIV model 62 DS spectrophotometer (Lakewood, NJ) at 25 °C using a 2-mm path length quartz cuvette and a monomer concentration of 10 μm in 50 mm, MOPS (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm Na2SO4. The protein solutions were scanned over 200–260 nm using a bandwidth of 2.0 nm and a data acquisition time of 5 s. The Fe2+ content of Cam was determined using the ferrous-chelating chromophore ferrozine (3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis(4-phenylsulfonic acid)-1,2,4-trizine) as previously described (17Dailey Jr., H.A. Lascelles J. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 129: 815-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except the assay mixture also contained 6.1 m guanidine hydrochloride to unfold the protein and allow the otherwise inaccessible ligated Fe2+ to bind ferrozine. Carbon dioxide hydrating activity was measured by stopped flow spectroscopy using the changing pH indicator method as described previously (10Alber B.E. Colangelo C.M. Dong J. Stålhandske C.M.V. Baird T.T. Tu C. Fierke C.A. Silverman D.N. Scott R.A. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13119-13128Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), except for enzymes purified anaerobically, in which case all of the solutions were anaerobic. The protein concentration determinations were performed as described (10Alber B.E. Colangelo C.M. Dong J. Stålhandske C.M.V. Baird T.T. Tu C. Fierke C.A. Silverman D.N. Scott R.A. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13119-13128Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The Mössbauer spectra were recorded on a spectrometer (WEB Research, Edina, MN) operating in the constant acceleration mode in a transmission geometry. During the measurement the sample was kept inside a SVT-400 Dewar from Janis (Wilmington, MA) at a temperature of 4.2 K in a magnetic field of 40 milliteslas applied parallel to the γ-beam. Data analysis was performed using the program WMOSS (WEB Research).RESULTSUnfolding Cam with denaturant in the presence of a metal chelator and subsequent refolding by removal of the denaturant yield trimeric apo-Cam that can be reconstituted with nearly a full complement of Zn2+ or Co2+ producing highly active enzymes (10Alber B.E. Colangelo C.M. Dong J. Stålhandske C.M.V. Baird T.T. Tu C. Fierke C.A. Silverman D.N. Scott R.A. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13119-13128Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of Zn2+- and Co2+-reconstituted Cam show the metals coordinated to the nitrogen atoms of histidines in all three active sites (18Iverson T.M. Alber B.E. Kisker C. Ferry J.G. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9222-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The properties of Cam reconstituted with Zn2+, Co2+, and several other metal ions are shown in Table I. Incorporation of Zn2+ or Fe2+ was nearly quantitative with respect to the three available metal binding sites. Although substoichiometric, reconstitution was substantial for Co2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+. Analysis for a suite of metals showed that the sum of contaminating metals (other than the indicated reconstitution metal) was less than 0.18/trimer for each reconstituted enzyme. An exception was the 57Fe2+-reconstituted Cam, for which a significant amount of contaminating zinc was incorporated. Attempts to reconstitute with Fe3+ or Mg2+ yielded enzymes with negligible amounts of the respective metals.Table IMetal content and kinetic constants of Cam preparationsPurificationGrowth supplementaThe enzymes were purified from E. coli cultured in medium supplemented with either 0.01 % (w/v) ferric ammonium citrate or 0.5 mm ZnSO4.Reconstitution metalMolar ratio of metal/trimerEffective kcat (×10-3 s-1)Km (×103m)Effective kcat/Km (×10-5m-1 s-1)AerobicZn2+Zn2+2.76 ± 0.15 zinc68.1 ± 4.0bEffective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the molar ratio of metal/monomer.21.8 ± 2.231.3 ± 5.1Zn2+Co2+2.37 ± 0.09 cobalt118.0 ± 10.5bEffective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the molar ratio of metal/monomer.15.7 ± 2.875.3 ± 19.9Zn2+Cu2+1.47 ± 0.06 copper9.2 ± 0.4bEffective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the molar ratio of metal/monomer.7.2 ± 0.812.9 ± 1.9Zn2+Mn2+2.34 ± 0.09 manganese5.8 ± 0.5bEffective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the molar ratio of metal/monomer.22.5 ± 3.42.6 ± 0.6Zn2+Ni2+2.37 ± 0.09 nickel0.7 ± 0.1bEffective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the molar ratio of metal/monomer.14.2 ± 2.80.5 ± 0.1Zn2+Cd2+2.46 ± 0.12 cadmium5.5 ± 0.3bEffective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the molar ratio of metal/monomer.22.1 ± 2.02.5 ± 0.4Zn2+Mg2+< 0.01 manganesecLimit of detection.NDdND, not determined.NDNDZn2+Fe3+< 0.01 ironcLimit of detection.NDNDNDAnaerobicFe3+Fe2+2.79 ± 0.12 iron243.3 ± 22.8bEffective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the molar ratio of metal/monomer.44.8 ± 7.454.4 ± 15.5Fe3+57Fe2+2.25 ± 0.12 iron110.2 ± 9.6eEffective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the sum of the molar ratio of metals/monomer.24.6 ± 3.544.8 ± 10.4Fe3+Zn2+, Fe2+, Co2+0.69 ± 0.06 zinc55.1 ± 7.7eEffective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the sum of the molar ratio of metals/monomer.24.3 ± 5.722.7 ± 8.62.37 ± 0.03 zinc0.33 ± 0.03 iron0.21 ± 0.03 cobaltFe3+No reconstitution2.70 ± 0.12 iron206.4 ± 61.7eEffective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the sum of the molar ratio of metals/monomer.26.1 ± 9.379.0 ± 51.80.30 ± 0.03 zincZn2+No reconstitution1.17 ± 0.03 zinc190.1 ± 44.4eEffective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the sum of the molar ratio of metals/monomer.40.7 ± 13.346.7 ± 26.21.02 ± 0.03 ironNo supplementationNo reconstitution1.89 ± 0.03 iron275.1 ± 7.7eEffective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the sum of the molar ratio of metals/monomer.46.0 ± 7.859.9 ± 17.50.27 ± 0.03 inc0.04 ± 0.01 coppera The enzymes were purified from E. coli cultured in medium supplemented with either 0.01 % (w/v) ferric ammonium citrate or 0.5 mm ZnSO4.b Effective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the molar ratio of metal/monomer.c Limit of detection.d ND, not determined.e Effective kcat and kcat/Km values were obtained by dividing apparent kcat and kcat/Km values by the sum of the molar ratio of metals/monomer. Open table in a new tab The coordination of metal by histidines from adjacent subunits contributes to the stability of the trimer (11Tripp B.C. Tu C. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); thus, apo-Cam is susceptible to subunit dissociation during size exclusion column chromatography. Recovery of the trimeric form of the reconstituted enzymes from the size exclusion column was proportional to the metal content (data not shown), a result indicating that the metals were coordinated in the active site. Attempts to reconstitute apo-Cam with Fe3+ or Mg2+ resulted in a nearly complete loss of the trimeric form consistent with the metal content, indicating that the active site of Cam is unable to accommodate these metals.The effective kcat and kcat/Km values (Table I) for the Zn2+- and Co2+-reconstituted enzymes were similar to published values (10Alber B.E. Colangelo C.M. Dong J. Stålhandske C.M.V. Baird T.T. Tu C. Fierke C.A. Silverman D.N. Scott R.A. Ferry J.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13119-13128Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Notably, the Fe2+-reconstituted Cam had effective kcat values that exceeded those for the Zn2+-and Co2+-reconstituted enzymes. Circular dichroism spectra for the Zn2+- and Fe2+-reconstituted enzymes were nearly identical, indicating a similar secondary structure (Fig. 1). These results indicate that iron functions at least as well as zinc in catalysis and also for the stability of the trimer. The divalent metals Cu2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ also replaced Zn2+; however, the low effective kcat values of these reconstituted enzymes relative to the value for the Fe2+-reconstituted Cam suggest that they are not physiologically relevant.The ferrozine assay indicated that iron present in the Fe2+-reconstituted enzyme was ferrous. Exposure to air diminished the kcat with a half-life of less than 5 min (Fig. 2), indicating the Fe2+-reconstituted Cam is oxygen-sensitive. The Mössbauer spectrum of 57Fe2+-reconstituted Cam is shown in Fig. 3B. The spectrum has two broad absorption lines at –0.5 mm/s and +2.9 mm/s. The spectrum collected over a narrower range of Doppler velocities (Fig. 3A) reveals the presence of at least two overlapping quadrupole doublets. The solid line overlaid with the experimental data in Fig. 3A is a theoretical simulation assuming two quadrupole doublets having the following parameters: isomer shift δ1 = 1.19 ± 0.03 mm/s, quadrupole splitting parameters ΔEQ1 = 3.00 ± 0.03 mm/s (47% of relative intensity); and δ2 = 1.15 ± 0.03 mm/s, ΔEQ2 = 3.54 ± 0.03 mm/s (53% of relative intensity). These parameters are typical of high spin Fe2+ sites coordinated by five or six nitrogen/oxygen ligands. The occurrence of two (or more) different iron species may reflect binding of different ligands (e.g. OH–, H2O, or HCO3-) to the iron center. Exposure of Zn2+-Cam to H2O2 had little effect on activity; however, the same treatment of Fe2+-reconstituted Cam rapidly produced a brown color with vigorous bubbling and reduced the kcat value to less than 10% consistent with oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ (Fig. 4). The Mössbauer spectrum of H2O2 -inactivated 57Fe2+-reconstituted Cam (Fig. 3C) exhibited a broad, magnetically split, six-line spectrum that is typical of high spin Fe3+ in the slow relaxation limit, which unambiguously demonstrates that exposure to H2O2 results in complete (>98%) oxidation of the high spin Fe2+ center. These results establish that the enzyme contains high spin ferrous iron and that oxidation to ferric iron inactivates the enzyme. The residual activity after oxidation of 57Fe2+-Cam is attributed to zinc-Cam (Table I) produced by reconstitution of apo-Cam with zinc contaminating the 57Fe2+.Fig. 2Air inactivation of Fe2+-reconstituted Cam. Samples of the enzyme (Table I) were assayed by the stopped flow method using metal-free buffers at the times indicated after exposure to 1.0 atmosphere of air at 25 °C.

The 100% activity (effective kcat values) for each of the reconstituted enzymes are shown in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Anaerobic size exclusion chromatography of air-oxidized Fe2+-Cam showed nearly complete loss of the trimeric form (not shown), indicating subunit dissociation as a consequence of the loss of Fe3+ from the active site. These results are consistent with the inability of Fe3+ to bind to apo-Cam (Table I) and suggest that only Fe2+ is able to coordinate in the active site. These results also suggest that Fe2+-Cam synthesized in vivo could lose iron during aerobic purification because of oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ with oxygen. All published descriptions of unreconstituted Cam report zinc as the only metal; however, the enzyme was produced in E. coli cultured in medium supplemented with Zn2+ and purified aerobically with buffers amended with Zn2+ (6Alber B.E. Ferry J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6909-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 16Alber B.E. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3270-3274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The low yields obtained both for cell mass and purified enzyme have precluded a reliable metal analysis of Cam produced in M. thermophila; thus, Cam was produced in E. coli that was cultured in unsupplemented medium or media supplemented with either Fe2+, Zn2+, or both and purified anaerobically without supplementation of buffers with metals. Table I shows the metal content and kinetic parameters. Each of the unreconstituted Cam preparations had effective kcat and kcat/Km values that approximated those for Fe2+-reconstituted Cam, a result consistent with the metal analysis showing incorporation of Fe2+. The sum of metals other than iron or zinc for each growth condition was less than 0.03/trimer, except for the enzyme purified from cells cultured in unsupplemented medium, which contained copper albeit in much lower amounts than iron or zinc (Table I). The enzyme purified from cells cultured in unsupplemented medium contained less than 0.01 cobalt/trimer. Substoichiometric amounts of metals were present in the enzymes purified from E. coli cultured in Zn2+-supplemented and unsupplemented media, indicating the presence of apo-protein in both of these enzyme preparations, results suggesting that iron and zinc were limiting for both culture conditions. The iron content of the enzyme purified from cells cultured in Fe2+-supplemented medium exceeded the zinc content by 9-fold. In contrast to the α class CAs (14Hunt J.A. Ahmed M. Fierke C.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9054-9062Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the Cam active site metal cannot be readily removed by dialysis with metal chelators unless the enzyme is unfolded with a chemical denaturant (10Alber B.E. Colangelo C.M. Dong J. Stålhandske C.M.V. Baird T.T. Tu C. Fierke C.A. Silverman D.N. Scott R.A. Ferry J.G.

Thus, it is highly unlikely that E. coli produced predominantly Zn2+-Cam, and the Zn2+ was exchanged for Fe2+ during anaerobic purification. These results establish that E. coli synthesizes Fe2+-Cam in vivo.Remarkably, Cam from E. coli cells cultured in medium supplemented with only Zn2+ (0.5 mm) contained iron in amounts approximately equal to that of zinc (Table I). This result is in stark contrast to that predicted by the Irving-Williams series, for which the stability of complexed Fe2+ is at least an order of magnitude less than that for Zn2+, Co2+, and Cu2+ ligated with nitrogen (19Sigel H. McCormick D.B. Acc. Chem. Res. 1970; 3: 201-208Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar); indeed, anaerobic reconstitution of apo-Cam with equimolar amounts of Fe2+, Zn2+, and Co2+ produced enzyme with predominantly zinc (Table I). Furthermore, E. coli cultured in unsupplemented medium produced Cam with 7-fold more iron than zinc, although metals analysis of the medium showed it contained 1.6 ppm of iron and 3.2 ppm of zinc. Finally, Cam purified from cells cultured in medium supplemented with only Zn2+ contained substoichiometric amounts of iron plus zinc in contrast to Cam purified from cells cultured in medium supplemented with Fe2+. These results establish that E. coli incorporates Fe2+ into Cam with greater efficiency compared with Zn2+.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here establish a previously unrecognized biological role for iron. It is reported that Cam from M. thermophila aerobically purified from E. coli cells cultured in Zn2+-supplemented medium contains substoichiometric amounts of zinc and no appreciable amounts of other metals, which lead to the conclusion that Cam is a zinc metalloenzyme (16Alber B.E. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3270-3274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, as reported here, Cam contained approximately equal amounts of iron and zinc when purified"

The present study demonstrates that two different voltage-gated calcium channels, which both interact with soluble N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins but have distinct subcellular distributions and roles in synaptic transmission, are differently distributed in lipid microdomains; presynaptic P/Q (Cav2.1) but not Lc (Cav1.2) calcium channel subtypes are mainly accumulated in detergent-insoluble complexes. The immunoisolation of multiprotein complexes from detergent-insoluble or detergent-soluble fractions shows that the α1A subunits of Cav2.1 colocalize and interact with SNARE complexes in lipid microdomains. The altered organization of these microdomains caused by saponin and methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment largely impairs the buoyancy and distribution of Cav2.1 channels and SNAREs in flotation gradients. On the other hand, cholesterol reloading partially reverses the drug effects.

The cholesterol-enriched microdomains contribute to optimizing the compartmentalization of exocytic machinery and the calcium influx that triggers synaptic vesicle exocytosis. When activated, the Ca2+ channels in many different cell types mediate a rapid Ca2+ influx that triggers important intracellular events (Ref. 1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar and references therein). In neurons and neuroendocrine cells, the Ca2+ entering through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels acts as the second messenger of electrical signaling and initiates regulated exocytosis and synaptic transmission. Five types of voltage-gated calcium channels have been identified in neurons on the basis of their physiological and pharmacological properties: L, N, P/Q, R, and T (recently referred to as Cav1, Cav2.2, Cav2.1, Cav2.3, and Cav3) (2Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Mori Y. Perez-Reyes E. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P. Tanabe T. Birnbaumer L. Tsien R.W. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 533-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). These distinct calcium channels show different compartmentalization on neuronal plasma membrane, e.g. Cav2.2, Cav2.1, and Cav2.3 are mainly located in the nerve terminals, where they form clusters in specialized regions of the presynaptic membrane (the active zones), which also contain predocked synaptic vesicles (Refs. 1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, 3Garner C.C. Kindler S. Gundelfinger E.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, and references therein). This clustered accumulation in specific membrane regions is presumably important for the roles of calcium channels in neurotransmitter release. It has been proposed that the formation of channel clusters may involve cytoskeletal elements and/or interactions with modular adaptor proteins (4Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Maximov A. Sudhof T.C. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24453-24456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), whereas another proposed mechanism is based on the formation of microdomains within the lipid bilayer that recruit specific proteins and form platforms for protein sorting and/or signal relay stations for intracellular signaling (see Refs. 6Brown D.A.

On the basis of the above, we investigated the lipid microdomain distribution of the two voltage-gated calcium channel subtypes Cav1.2 (Lc) and Cav2.1 (P/Q). These channels are particularly interesting because they both interact with SNARE proteins (Refs. 1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, 16Catterall W.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 144-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 17Atlas D. J.

A large proportion of Cav1.2 channels is concentrated in the soma and at the tips of dendritic spines, where they often colocalize with the β2-adrenergic receptor to form postsynaptic complexes regulating synaptic transmission (19Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E. Warner C. Ahlijanian M.K. Prystay W. Gilbert M.M. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 20Davare M.A. Avdonin V.

Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), whereas channels 2.1 are mainly clustered in the presynaptic terminals of many neurons, where they mediate the rapid calcium influx that triggers synaptic vesicle fusion (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, 21Dunlap K. Luebke J.I. Turner T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). The results of the study show that Cav2.1 but not Cav1.2 channels are widely distributed in lipid microdomains, in which they colocalize and interact with SNARE protein complexes as shown by immunoisolation. Altering the organization of synaptosomal membrane lipid microdomains by means of the cholesterol-complexing drug, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), alters the distribution of Cav2.1 and inhibits their interactions with SNAREs. Furthermore, cholesterol depletion reduces calcium influx in the synaptosomes in response to depolarization. Taken together, these data support the conclusion that lipid microdomains in presynaptic membranes are important for defining organized sites in which specific voltage-gated calcium channel subtypes and SNAREs are colocalized. The Infinity cholesterol reagent, cholesterol, MβCD, saponin, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (octylglucopyranoside), and the antibodies against syn1, α1A and α1C (subunits of Cav2.1 and Cav1.2 channels, respectively), mouse IgG, rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-coupled choleratoxin subunit B, and anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG conjugated with peroxidase were all from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy). The antibody against the transferrin receptor was purchased from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Ultrapure Triton X-100 solution (Surfact-Amps X-100) came from Pierce; the antibodies against VAMP-2 and SNAP-25 were from Synaptic Systems (Goettingen, Germany); and 125I-labeled ω-conotoxin MVIIC (125I-labeled ω-CTxMVIIC, 2,000Ci/mmol) and [45Ca]Cl2 (2.8 mCi/ml) were from Amersham Biosciences. The antiserum against munc-18-1 has been characterized previously (15Rowe J. Calegari F. Taverna E. Longhi R. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3323-3332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies directed against synaptotagmin1 (22Malgaroli A. Ting A.E. Wendland B. Bergamaschi A. Villa A. Tsien R.W. Scheller R.H. Science. 1995; 268: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) were a gift from A. Malgaroli (DIBIT, Milan, Italy). The Bio-Rad Protein Assay was purchased from Bio-Rad. Rat brain fractionation was carried out by means of differential centrifugation, essentially as described previously (23Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 24Taverna E. Francolini M. Jeromin A. Hilfiker S. Roder J. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3909-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the dissected cerebral cortices were homogenized in 4 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3, containing 0.32 m sucrose and protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin); the total homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g, and the postnuclear supernatant was collected and centrifuged as described previously (23Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) to yield a pellet corresponding to the synaptosomal fraction (P2) and a supernatant (S2). The S2 containing the remaining membrane-bound vesicles and organelles of the total homogenate was centrifuged at 165,000 × g for 2 h to yield a high-speed supernatant corresponding to the cytosol and a pellet (P3) enriched in cell body organelles (24Taverna E. Francolini M. Jeromin A. Hilfiker S. Roder J. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3909-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Saponin Treatment—The P2 samples (2000 or 700 μg of proteins) were resuspended in 250 μl of a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (buffer A) containing 1% (w/v) saponin (protein:detergent ratios 1:1.25 or 1:3.6) and incubated for 30 min on ice. MβCD Treatment—The P2 samples (660 μg of proteins) were resuspended in 250 μl of buffer A supplemented with protease inhibitors, incubated with or without 10 or 30 mm MβCD (final concentration) for 40 min at 37 °C and then recentrifuged. The supernatants were completely removed, and the synaptosomal pellets were resuspended in the appropriate buffer for cholesterol reloading or Triton X-100 solubilization and gradient analysis. Cholesterol Reloading—The cholesterol and MβCD inclusion complexes were prepared as described by Klein et al. (25Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 mg of cholesterol dissolved in methanol:chloroform (2:1) were added to 10 ml of a 5% MβCD solution and incubated for 90 min at 80 °C. After MβCD treatment, the P2 samples (500 μg) were resuspended in 320 μl of buffer A containing 10 mm cholesterol/MβCD complexes and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After reloading, the P2 samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were resuspended in buffer A for further analysis. Cholesterol concentrations were determined in aliquots of the untreated (control), MβCD-treated, and MβCD/cholesterol complextreated P2 samples. The aliquots were centrifuged, the synaptosomal pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid-sodium salt, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2), and the amount of cholesterol was determined using the Infinity cholesterol reagent according to the Sigma protocol. The protein concentrations in the MβCD and cholesterol/MβCD-treated samples were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. The proteins from the untreated P2 and P3 samples, or the P2 samples treated with saponin, MβCD, or cholesterol/MβCD, were adjusted in 250 μl of buffer A (supplemented with protease inhibitors) containing a final concentration of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 (protein: detergent ratios 1:1.25 or 1:3.6). The samples were then incubated for 30 min on ice. The detergent-insoluble complexes were separated by centrifugation on discontinuous gradients as described previously (15Rowe J. Calegari F. Taverna E. Longhi R. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3323-3332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat.Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 μl of buffer A containing 2.4 m sucrose was added to 250 μl of each sample, which was then placed in a centrifuge tube and overlaid with 1 ml of 0.9 m, 0.5 ml of 0.8 m, 1 ml of 0.7 m, and 1 ml of 0.1 m of sucrose solutions (all prepared in buffer A). The discontinuous gradients were centrifuged at 335,000 × g for 16 h using a rotor SW 55 Ti (Beckman Instruments), after which 500-μl fractions were taken. The pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of buffer A. Forty to 60 μl of each fraction were analyzed by means of SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The sucrose concentration in each fraction was determined by refractometry; the mean values of seven gradients from three different experiments are shown. The immunocomplexes from the sucrose gradient fractions were isolated by means of immunoprecipitations or immunoaffinity columns. For the immunoisolation of the proteins colocalized in lipid microdomains, particular care was taken to preserve the properties of the microdomains. All of the procedures were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. Aliquots of the gradient fractions were adjusted to 0.3 m sucrose with buffer A without detergent and incubated with anti-syn1, VAMP-2, or SNAP-25 monoclonal antibodies prebound to protein G beads. As a control, equal sample amounts were immunoprecipitated with nonimmune mouse IgG prebound to protein G beads. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with gentle mixing, the beads were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min, washed three times with buffer A containing 0.3% Tween 20, and resuspended in Laemmli's sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207521) Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes and aliquots (1:5) of the samples used for immunoisolation (inputs) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For the immunoisolation of the protein complexes, immunoaffinity column purification or immunoprecipitations were carried out after solubilization of the lipid microdomains. Equal aliquots (1.5 ml) of fractions 3 and 7 were diluted (to 6 ml) in buffer A containing 0. 3 m sucrose and 1% Triton X-100 and then incubated for 30 min on ice, followed by 15 min at 28 °C to solubilize the lipid microdomains. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-syn1 antibodies covalently conjugated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were then washed three times with 0.2% octylglucopyranoside in PBS, and the protein complexes were eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.2, containing 0.2% octylglucopyranoside, neutralized with potassium phosphate, and separated on polyacrylamide gels. The proteins in the gels were stained with SYPRO Orange (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using a VersaDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad) or transferred to nitrocellulose filters for immunoblotting. The samples underwent SDS-PAGE on 6, 10, or 12% polyacrylamide gels and were then blotted onto nitrocellulose (NC) membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) with 0.45-μm pores. The Western blots were analyzed as described previously (24Taverna E. Francolini M. Jeromin A. Hilfiker S. Roder J. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3909-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For all antibodies except anti-α1A and α1C, the blots were blocked overnight in 5% not-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), washed in a buffer containing 5% non-fat milk and 0.3% Tween 20 in TBS (immunoblotting buffer), incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody diluted in immunoblotting buffer, and then washed and incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. After another series of washes, peroxidase was detected using chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce). The antibodies directed against the calcium channel subunits were diluted from 1:400 to 1:2000 in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS. To detect ganglioside GM1, the samples were separated on 15% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to NC membranes, and incubated with peroxidase-coupled choleratoxin subunit B diluted 1:100,000 in immunoblotting buffer. After extensive washing, peroxidase was detected using chemiluminescent substrates. Alternatively, 0.5–1 μl of each gradient fraction was spotted directly onto NC membranes, which were then probed with peroxidase-coupled choleratoxin subunit B as described above. 125I-Labeled ω-CTxMVIIC binding was performed essentially as described previously (28Hillyard D.R. Monje V.D. Mintz I.M. Bean B.P. Nadasdi L. Ramachandran J. Miljanich G. Azimi-Zoonooz A. McIntosh J.M. Cruz L.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 69-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Because sucrose can inhibit toxin binding in a dose-dependent manner (29Passafaro M. Rosa P. Sala C. Clementi F. Sher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30096-30104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), 100 μl of each fraction were brought to 1 ml in a buffer containing a final concentration of 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4 (buffer B). Each sample was incubated with 0.3 nm of 125I-labeled ω-CTxMVIIC for 40 min at 37 °C and then filtered through GF/B filters presoaked in 1% polyethyleneimine. After washing in buffer B, the radioactivity of the filters was counted in a gamma counter. Each point was evaluated in triplicate, with nonspecific 125I-labeled ω-CTxMVIIC binding being evaluated for each group by means of the parallel incubation of samples in the presence of an excess of unlabeled toxin (100 nm). P2 samples were resuspended in a buffer containing 145 mm choline chloride, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4 (buffer C). Aliquots (660 μg/250 μl) were incubated with or without MβCD (10 or 30 mm) for 40 min at 37 °C. Cholesterol and protein concentrations were determined in aliquots of untreated (control) and MβCD-treated samples as described above. 45Ca2+ uptake was initiated by adding 320 μl of pre-warmed basal medium (buffer C) or depolarizing buffer (62.5 mm choline chloride, 87.5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4) containing 3 μCi/ml of [45Ca]Cl2. When Cd2+ or EGTA was used, they were included in the depolarizing buffer at final concentrations of 100 and 10 μm, respectively. 45Ca2+ uptake was terminated after 15 s by means of the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold buffer C containing 100 μm CdCl2 and immediate filtration through Whatman GF/B filters, followed by washes with ice-cold buffer C supplemented with Cd2+. The radioactivity of each filter was counted using a beta counter, and the data were expressed as nanomoles of 45Ca2+/mg of protein. The synaptosomes (P2) were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 4 °C, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h at room temperature, washed extensively, dehydrated in ethanol series, and then embedded in Epon. Sections of a pale-gold, silver interference color were obtained with a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome, collected on copper grids, counterstained with a saturated aqueous solution of uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate, and finally examined using a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscope. Calcium Channels and SNAREs in Detergent-resistant Membranes Isolated from Synaptosomes—Over the last 10 years, various procedures have been developed for isolating the detergent-insoluble complexes obtained by treating cells or membranes with weak detergents at low temperature. These detergent-resistant complexes identify lipid microdomains that are thought to resemble the self-organized lipid-protein complexes present in the membrane before detergent treatment (Refs. 6Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2065) Google Scholar, 7Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar and references therein). We analyzed the lipid microdomains in rat brain fractions enriched in nerve terminal (synaptosome) or cell soma membranes following well-established procedures. The pellets enriched in synaptosomes (P2) were separated from the homogenates of rat brain cortices by means of differential centrifugation (23Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The supernatants containing the remaining membranes and organelles of the cell soma (including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus) (24Taverna E. Francolini M. Jeromin A. Hilfiker S. Roder J. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3909-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were centrifuged at high speed to obtain P3 pellets. Low-density, Triton X-100-insoluble complexes prepared from P2 and P3 were then separated from the soluble proteins using flotation equilibrium sucrose density gradients as described previously (15Rowe J. Calegari F. Taverna E. Longhi R. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3323-3332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat.Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that this method separates the Triton X-100-insoluble complexes (which peak in fractions 3 and 4) from the fully soluble and cytoskeletal proteins (which peak in fractions 7–8). In line with previous data (26Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat.Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), the soluble fraction marker transferrin receptor was only detected in the very high-density fractions (fraction 8 in the P2 gradients; fractions 7 and 8 in the P3 gradients; Fig. 1). On the contrary, the low-density marker GM1 was detected mainly in the low-density fractions (peaking in fractions 3–4). We then examined the gradient distribution of the molecular components of the exocytic machinery and the α subunits of Cav2.1 and Cav1.2 (Fig. 1). The proteins from the fractions collected from P2 or P3 gradients were separated on 12% gels, transferred onto NC filters, and probed with polyclonal antibodies directed against synaptotagmin1 (22Malgaroli A. Ting A.E. Wendland B. Bergamaschi A. Villa A. Tsien R.W. Scheller R.H. Science. 1995; 268: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and munc-18-1 (15Rowe J. Calegari F. Taverna E. Longhi R. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3323-3332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or commercially available monoclonal antibodies against the SNARE proteins syn1, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2. As shown in Fig. 1, significant amounts of SNAREs and synaptotagmin1 were found to float in the low-density fractions (mainly in fractions 3–4) collected from the Triton X-100-treated P2 or P3 samples, although larger amounts were detected in the high-density fractions, as reported previously for neuroendocrine PC12 cells (13Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, unlike in PC12 cells, a small but significant amount of the syn1-accessory protein munc-18-1 was also found in the low-density fractions of the P2 gradients (Fig. 1). Not all of the proteins known to play a role in exocytic machinery function floated. In line with previous results (13Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), immunoblotting did not detect synaptophysin (which interacts with VAMP-2 in synaptic vesicle membrane) or complexins (cytosolic proteins that selectively bind to assembled SNARE complexes) (10Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar) in the low-density fractions of the P2 gradients (data not shown). We then investigated the flotation gradient distribution of Cav2.1 and Cav1.2 channels. The blots were probed with commercially available polyclonal antibodies directed against the α1A or α1C subunits. Before being used on the gradient fractions, the antibodies were immunoblot tested on P2 membrane proteins, in which they recognized bands of the expected molecular size; in 6% polyacrylamide gels, the anti-α1A antibody recognized a major band of ∼190 kDa and a very minor polypeptide of ∼210 kDa, which appears after longer exposure (data not shown) and is consistent with the results of previous work on rat brain and chromaffin cell membranes (30Sakurai T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44804-44811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The antibody against the α1C subunit detected three bands of ∼190, 200, and 220/230 kDa (data not shown), as reported previously (19Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E. Warner C. Ahlijanian M.K. Prystay W. Gilbert M.M. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). When the blots were immunostained with irrelevant rabbit IgG as a control, no bands of the same molecular sizes as those revealed by the specific anti-α 49 subunit antibodies were immunodetected. Analysis of the flotation gradient fractions using the anti-α1A or α1C antibodies revealed that the Cav2.1 α1A subunit (immunodetected as the polypeptide of ∼190 kDa) was almost exclusively present in the lower-density fractions (fractions 3–4) of the P2 gradients (Fig. 1), whereas the α1C subunit was mainly detected in the high-density fractions, although a minor portion was also immunodetected in the lighter fractions (Fig. 1). Finally, the amounts of α1A and α1C found in the Triton X-100-treated P3 samples were much less than those detected in the P2 membranes, and only very faint immunoreactive bands were detected in the high-density fractions. To analyze further the presence of Cav2.1 in the gradient fraction"
https://openalex.org/W2164674592,"The deleted in liver cancer (DLC-1) gene at chromosome 8p21-22 is altered mainly by genomic deletion or aberrant promoter methylation in a large number of human cancers such as breast, liver, colon and prostate and is known to have an inhibitory effect on breast and liver tumor cell growth. Given the high frequency of deletion involving region 8p21-22 in human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), we examined alterations of DLC-1 in a series of primary tumors and tumor cell lines and tested effects of DLC-1 on tumor cell growth. A significant decrease or absence of the DLC-1 mRNA expression was found in 95% of primary NSCLC (20/21) and 58% of NSCLC cell lines (11/19). Transcriptional silencing of DLC-1 was primarily associated with aberrant DNA methylation, rather than genomic deletion as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced reactivation of DLC-1 expression in 82% (9/11) NSCLC cell lines showing downregulated DLC-1. It was further evidenced by an aberrant DLC-1 promoter methylation pattern, which was detected by Southern blotting in 73% (8/11) of NSCLC cell lines with downregulation of the gene. The transfer of DLC-1 into three DLC-1 negative cell lines caused a significant inhibition in cell proliferation and/or a decrease in colony formation. Furthermore, stable transfer of DLC-1 abolished tumorigenicity in nude mice of two cell lines, suggesting that DLC-1 plays a role in NSCLC by acting as a bona fide new tumor suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2027519382,"ATP-citrate lyase (Acly) is one of two cytosolic enzymes that synthesize acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Because acetyl-CoA is an essential building block for cholesterol and triglycerides, Acly has been considered a therapeutic target for hyperlipidemias and obesity. To define the phenotype of Acly-deficient mice, we created Acly knockout mice in which a β-galactosidase marker is expressed from Acly regulatory sequences. We also sought to define the cell type-specific expression patterns of Acly to further elucidate the in vivo roles of the enzyme. Homozygous Acly knockout mice died early in development. Heterozygous mice were healthy, fertile, and normolipidemic on both chow and high fat diets, despite expressing half-normal amounts of Acly mRNA and protein. Fibroblasts and hepatocytes from heterozygous Acly mice contained half-normal amounts of Acly mRNA and protein, but this did not perturb triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis or the expression of lipid biosynthetic genes regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins. The expression of acetyl-CoA synthetase 1, another cytosolic enzyme for producing acetyl-CoA, was not up-regulated. As judged by β-galactosidase staining, Acly was expressed ubiquitously but was expressed particularly highly in tissues with high levels of lipogenesis, such as in the livers of mice fed a high-carbohydrate diet. β-Galactosidase staining was intense in the developing brain, in keeping with the high levels of de novo lipogenesis of the tissue. In the adult brain, β-galactosidase staining was in general much lower, consistent with reduced levels of lipogenesis; however, β-galactosidase expression remained very high in cholinergic neurons, likely reflecting the importance of Acly in generating acetyl-CoA for acetylcholine synthesis. The Acly knockout allele is useful for identifying cell types with a high demand for acetyl-CoA synthesis.

ATP-citrate lyase (Acly) 1The abbreviations used are: Acly, ATP-citrate lyase; Acs1, acetyl-CoA synthetase 1; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; βgeo, a fusion of β-galactosidase and neomycin phosphotransferase II; Gapdh, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; dpc, days post-coitus. is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the formation of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and oxaloacetate from citrate and CoA, with the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate. Acetyl-CoA is the key building block for de novo lipogenesis. Acly is not, however, the sole source of acetyl-CoA in the cytosol. Another enzyme, acetyl-CoA synthetase 1 (Acs1), generates acetyl-CoA from acetate and CoA, with the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and diphosphate (1Knowles S.E. Jarrett I.G. Filsell O.H. Ballard F.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Whether Asc1 might be sufficient in the setting of a genetic deficiency in Acly is not known. The expression of both Acly and Acs1 is controlled by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, a transcriptional regulator of fatty acid synthesis (2Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S.

An important role for Acly in lipid biosynthesis in the liver has been suggested by studies with the Acly inhibitor hydroxycitrate. In rats treated with hydroxycitrate, the rate of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis in the liver fall (4Sullivan A.C. Triscari J. Hamilton J.G. Miller O.N. Wheatley V.R.

As with other genes involved in lipid synthesis, the expression of Acly in the liver is regulated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level by SREBP-1 (3Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E.

When lipid biosynthesis levels in the liver are low, as in fasted mice, Acly mRNA levels are low. However, when fasted mice are fed a carbohydrate-rich diet, lipid biosynthesis rates and Acly mRNA levels increase (3Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Lipid synthesis is important in the developing brain, particularly for myelination (13Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Northern blots have shown that Acly mRNA levels increase in the rat brain during the first week of suckling, when de novo lipogenesis is high (14Elshourbagy N.A. Near J.C. Kmetz P.J. Sathe G.M.

However, those experiments have not revealed which regions of the brain, or which cell types in the brain, express Acly at high levels. Acly is also highly expressed in the kidney (15Foster D.W.

In this study, we explored the physiologic importance of Acly in mice. We had three goals. First, we were interested in determining if a complete absence of Acly would be compatible with embryonic development. Second, we wanted to determine whether half-normal levels of Acly, as in heterozygous Acly knockout mice, would be associated with alterations in lipid synthesis, plasma lipid levels, or body weight. Third, we sought to define the cell type-specific expression of Acly, both during development and in adult mice, to better understand the in vivo roles of Acly. To address these questions, we produced and characterized Acly-deficient mice. Acly-deficient Mice—A mouse embryonic stem cell line (cell line NPX098, strain 129/Ola) containing an insertional mutation in Acly was identified within BayGenomics, a gene-trapping resource (17Stryke D. Kawamoto M. Huang C.C. Johns S.J. King L.A. Harper C.A. Meng E.C. Lee R.E. Yee A. L'Italien L. Chuang P.T. Young S.G. Skarnes W.C. Babbitt P.C. Ferrin T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The gene-trap vector used (pGT1δTMpfs) contains a splice-acceptor sequence upstream of a reporter gene, βgeo (a fusion of β-galactosidase and neomycin phosphotransferase II) (17Stryke D. Kawamoto M. Huang C.C. Johns S.J. King L.A. Harper C.A. Meng E.C. Lee R.E. Yee A. L'Italien L. Chuang P.T. Young S.G. Skarnes W.C. Babbitt P.C. Ferrin T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As judged by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (18Townley D.J. Avery B.J. Rosen B. Skarnes W.C. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the insertional mutation in NPX098 occurred in the first intron of Acly, following a noncoding first exon. Thus, the mutation results in the production of a fusion transcript consisting of exon 1 sequences from Acly and βgeo. The mutation created a new EcoRV site in intron 1, which was useful for genotyping mice by Southern blots (see below). NPX098 was injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice, which were bred to establish Acly knockout mice. All mice described herein had a mixed genetic background (∼50% C57BL/6 and ∼50% 129/Ola). The mice were weaned at 21 days of age, housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, and fed a chow diet containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). In some experiments, the mice were fed a Western diet (21% fat, 50% carbohydrate, and 20% protein) from Research Diets (New Brunswick, NJ) or a fat-free, carbohydrate-rich diet (60.2% sucrose and 20% casein) from ICN (Irvine, CA). Mice were genotyped by Southern blots with EcoRV-digested genomic DNA and a 5′ Acly flanking probe. The probe was amplified from mouse genomic DNA with primers 5′-CGCTGGTCAAGAATGGGTGTTACAA-3′ and 5′-CTCCCTCCCCCAACCTCAAACTAAG-3′. Mouse Primary Embryonic Fibroblasts—Timed matings were established between Acly+/- mice, and pregnant females were sacrificed 13.5-17.5 days post-coitus (dpc). Embryos were incubated overnight in 5 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen, Carslbad, CA) at 4 °C. The next morning, embryos were mechanically disrupted in 5 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, penicillin, streptomycin, Fungizone (Invitrogen), and 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). After removal of debris, cells were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes. Mouse Primary Hepatocytes—Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% avertin, and a catheter was introduced into the inferior vena cava via the right atrium. The liver was perfused with liver perfusion media (Invitrogen) and then collagenase-lipase media (Invitrogen). The digested liver was then removed and mechanically disrupted. The cell suspension was filtered through sterile gauze and centrifuged at 50 × g. Hepatocytes were then washed three times with hepatocyte wash media (Invitrogen), and 5 × 105 cells/well were plated in 6-well collagen-coated tissue culture plates. Cells were allowed to attach to the plate for 4 h before starting the labeling experiments (see below). Cells were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in 3 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate, l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, penicillin, streptomycin, and Fungizone. Analysis of Cholesterol and Triglyceride Synthesis by Thin-layer Chromatography—Acly+/+ and Acly+/- fibroblasts were grown to 90% confluency in 100-mm Petri dishes. Cells were then labeled with 50 μCi of [1(3)-3H]glycerol (Amersham Biosciences), 10 μCi of [1,5-14C]citric acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), or 25 μCi of [1-14C]acetic acid (Amersham Biosciences). Primary hepatocytes were labeled with 10 μCi of [1(3)-3H]glycerol. Lipids from fibroblasts and hepatocytes were extracted with hexane:isopropyl alcohol (3:2 (v/v)), dried under nitrogen, and resuspended in 100 μl of chloroform. Triglycerides and free cholesterol were separated on thin-layer chromatography silica plates (60 Å) in hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1 (v/v/v)). Samples were assayed in duplicates (40 μl/lane). After lipid extraction, cell protein was quantified with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Blood samples were taken from the retroorbital sinus under anesthesia (2.5% avertin). Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids were measured with enzymatic assays (Abbott Spectrum (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL), triglycerides/glycerol blanked (Roche/Hitachi, Indianapolis, IN), and free fatty acids half-micro test (Roche Applied Science), respectively). Liver lipids were extracted (19Björkegren J. Beigneux A. Bergo M.O. Maher J.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5476-5483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the amounts of cholesterol and triglycerides were measured (20Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Before harvesting of liver tissue, mice were anesthetized and perfused with saline. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from 50 to 150 mg of mouse tissue or from fibroblasts grown on 100-mm Petri dishes with Tri-Reagent (Sigma). Total RNA (25 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred onto a Nytran SuPerCharge membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). A mouse multiple-tissue poly(A)+ RNA blot and a mouse embryo poly(A)+ RNA blot (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were used to determine the tissue pattern of Acly expression in adult mice and to examine the temporal expression of Acly during embryogenesis. Bands on Northern blots were visualized by autoradiography (Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by densitometry (Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad). We used the same Acly cDNA probe that has been described previously (11Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). A β-galactosidase cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from Acly+/- mouse liver RNA with primers 5′-TTTTCGATGAGCGTGGTGGTTATGC-3′ and 5′-GCGCGTACATCGGGCAAATAATATC-3′; an Asc1 cDNA was amplified with oligonucleotides 5′-TGCTGAGGACCCACTCTTCATCTTG-3′ and 5′-AAGCAGAACCAGGTTTCATGGGTGT-3′. A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) probe and an 18 S cDNA were used as controls for RNA integrity and loading. [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes were prepared with All-in-One random prime labeling mixture (Sigma). Standard prehybridization, hybridization, and washing procedures were used (21Beigneux A. Withycombe S.K. Digits J.A. Tschantz W.R. Weinbaum C.A. Griffey S.M. Bergo M. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol.

Quantitative Real-time PCR—Real-time PCR conditions and oligonucleotides to measure mRNA levels for Acly, Acs2, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, glycerol-3-phosphate-acyltransferase, long-chain fatty acyl elongase, glucose-6-phosphatase, glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase were described previously (22Moon Y.A. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7335-7343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The level of Gapdh mRNA was used as a control. Western Blot Analysis—Fresh mouse tissues (liver, white adipose tissue, kidney, and brain) (0.5-1 g), or embryonic fibroblasts (grown to 80-90% confluency in 100-mm Petri dishes) were homogenized in RIPA buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatant fluid was determined with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Denatured proteins (60-100 μg) were loaded onto precast 4-15% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). After electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blots were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween and 3% bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 4 °C and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a rabbit antibody against rat Acly (14Elshourbagy N.A.

Blots were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:50,000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 45 min at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected with the ECL Plus Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences); the blots were exposed to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by densitometry as described above. Immunohistochemistry and β-Galactosidase Staining—Mice were anesthetized with avertin and perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissues were harvested and fixed in 10% formalin for 4 h at 4 °C, immersed in 30% glucose for ∼16 h at 4 °C, and frozen in O.C.T. (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) for cryostat sectioning. β-Galactosidase activity was assessed by incubating 10-μm thick sections with a staining solution containing 1.3 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Invitrogen) for 16 h at 37 °C (23Bergo M.O. Gavino B.J. Steenbergen R. Sturbois B. Parlow A.F. Sanan D.A. Skarnes W.C. Vance J.E. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47701-47708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After staining, slides were counterstained with Eosin Y (Sigma). In some experiments, β-galactosidase staining was followed by immunohistochemistry. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-human glial fibrillary acidic protein (Sigma, 1:1,000), mouse monoclonal anti-neuronal nuclei (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, 1:1,000), goat anti-human choline acetyltransferase (Chemicon, 1:1,000), and goat anti-rat vesicular acetylcholine transporter (Chemicon, 1:5,000). Sections were subsequently incubated with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG), and antigen-antibody complexes were detected after incubation with horseradish peroxidase and diaminobenzidine substrate (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were examined and photographed on an Eclipse 6600 microscope (Nikon, Japan) equipped with a Spot RT Slider digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Burlingame, CA). The insertional mutation in the first intron of Acly introduced a new EcoRV site, making it possible to use Southern blots to distinguish between a 29.2-kilobase (kb) EcoRV fragment in the wild-type allele and a shorter (∼6.2-kb) EcoRV fragment in the mutant allele (Fig. 1A). The mutation results in the production of a fusion transcript containing sequences from exon 1 joined to βgeo (Fig. 1B). There is little doubt that the insertional mutation inactivated Acly. Acly mRNA levels were decreased by ∼50% in Acly+/- mice (Fig. 1B), as were Acly protein levels (Fig. 1C). Acly+/- mice were intercrossed in an attempt to obtain homozygous knockout mice. However, genotyping of more than 60 litters did not yield any homozygous mice. Moreover, we genotyped more than 80 embryos from 8.5 to 17.5 dpc, and found no homozygous knockout embryos. Acly is expressed at high levels throughout embryonic development (Fig. 2A), and β-galactosidase staining revealed that Acly is expressed at high levels in the neural tube at 8.5 dpc (Fig. 2B). We concluded that Acly expression in embryos is required for development. We predicted that Acly+/- mice would have reduced body weight and lower plasma lipid levels as a consequence of a reduced capability for lipid synthesis. However, the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids in the plasma were no different in chow-fed Acly+/+ and Acly+/- mice (Table I). Moreover, feeding the mice a Western diet did not yield any significant difference in plasma lipid levels (Table I) or in hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels (not shown). Body weights of Acly+/+ and Acly+/- mice were virtually identical (Table I).Table IPlasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids (FFA) in Acly +/+ and Acly +/− mice fed a Western dietBaseline1 month+/+ (n = 18)+/− (n = 14)+/+ (n = 18)+/− (n = 14)Body weight (g)20.6 ± 0.6319.1 ± 1.0733.0 ± 0.7031.1 ± 1.13Cholesterol (mg/dl)83.4 ± 3.4182.1 ± 3.61148 ± 9.28137 ± 8.34Triglycerides (mg/dl)67.4 ± 18.452.4 ± 14.6129 ± 18.7113 ± 14.2FFA (μm)411 ± 33.7428 ± 70.6688 ± 78.7668 ± 106 Open table in a new tab We suspected that Acly+/- mice might exhibit reduced weight gain and lower plasma lipid levels when fed a high-carbohydrate diet, which results in high levels of de novo lipogenesis in the liver. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, body weights and plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and glucose were similar in Acly+/+ and Acly+/- mice over 3 months of observation (Table II). Also, feeding the carbohydrate-rich diet to Acly+/- mice was not associated with reduced liver stores of cholesterol and triglycerides (Table III).Table IIPlasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids (FFA) in Acly +/+ and Acly +/− mice fed a fat-free, carbohydrate-rich dietBaseline1 month+/+ (n = 8)+/− (n = 8)+/+ (n = 8)+/− (n = 8)Body weight (g)21.2 ± 0.8018.5 ± 1.2629.2 ± 1.2426.4 ± 1.31Cholesterol (mg/dl)95.3 ± 5.0085.3 ± 3.8883.3 ± 16.478.8 ± 3.78Triglycerides (mg/dl)49.8 ± 8.2542.6 ± 6.2112.8 ± 2.3714.1 ± 2.55FFA (μm)435 ± 50.1428 ± 70.7413 ± 61.4318 ± 39.7 Open table in a new tab Table IIIHepatic cholesterol and triglyceride contents in Acly +/+ and Acly +/− mice fed a fat-free, carbohydrate-rich dietBaseline3 months+/+ (n = 6)+/− (n = 14)+/+ (n = 6)+/− (n = 14)Cholesterol (mg/g protein)7.88 ± 1.165.97 ± 0.7732.3 ± 17.049.1 ± 7.21Triglycerides (mg/g protein)395 ± 39.0361 ± 19.1702 ± 207628 ± 53.2 Open table in a new tab We also examined lipid synthesis in primary fibroblasts from Acly+/+ and Acly+/- embryos. As expected, Acly mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein levels (Fig. 3B) were reduced by ∼50% in heterozygous cells. However, the amount of cholesterol synthesis in Acly+/+ and Acly+/- fibroblasts was similar, as judged by [14C]citrate metabolic labeling experiments (Fig. 3C). It was not possible to assess the impact of reduced Acly expression on triglyceride synthesis, because very little [14C]citrate was incorporated into triglycerides. However, Acly+/+ and Acly+/- fibroblasts displayed similar amounts of triglyceride synthesis in [3H]glycerol labeling experiments (Fig. 3C). Similarly, cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis rates were entirely normal in primary hepatocytes from Acly+/- mice (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Levels of cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis in primary hepatocytes from Acly+/+ and Acly+/- mice. Cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis rates in Acly+/- cells are expressed as a percentage of those in Acly+/+ cells. The levels of incorporation of [1(3)-3H]glycerol into cholesterol and triglycerides in wild-type cells were 583 ± 33 cpm/μg of protein and 56,085 ± 2,919 cpm/μg of protein, respectively. Data represent the average of triplicate determinations, and each experiment was repeated twice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The fact that the Acly+/- mice and Acly+/- cells did not manifest detectable perturbations in lipid levels or lipid biosynthesis suggested that half-normal levels of Acly have little impact on cellular lipid homeostasis. Indeed, this appeared to be the case. As judged by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, Acly mRNA levels were reduced by 50% in Acly+/- cells, but the expression of a host of other enzymes involved in triglyceride, cholesterol, and glucose metabolism was not perturbed (Figs. 3D and 5A). Of note, the half-normal levels of Acly expression did not lead to an up-regulation of the expression of Asc1, the other acetyl-CoA-synthesizing enzyme in the cytosol (Figs. 3A and 5B). In keeping with the latter finding, the synthesis of cholesterol and triglycerides from [14C]acetate (a measure of Acs1 activity (2Luong A. Hannah V.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26458-26466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)) was identical in Acly+/+ and Acly+/- cells (Fig. 3C). Northern blots showed that Acly is expressed in multiple tissues (Fig. 6A). To explore the cell-type specific expression patterns, sections of tissues from Acly+/- mice were stained for β-galactosidase expression. Strong β-galactosidase expression was identified in multiple cell types, including Leydig cells in testis (Fig. 6B) and renal tubular cells (Fig. 6C). In the livers of chow-fed mice, β-galactosidase staining was largely confined to the periportal hepatocytes (Fig. 6D). In mice fed a fat-free, carbohydrate-rich diet, β-galactosidase staining of the liver was much more widespread and more intense (Fig. 6E), reflecting increased levels of Acly expression (Fig. 6G). On the Western diet, β-galactosidase staining of the liver was only modestly increased, compared with the chow diet (Fig. 6F). β-Galactosidase expression was intense throughout the brains of 15.5 dpc Acly+/- embryos (Fig. 7A) and 1-day-old Acly+/- pups (Fig. 7B), consistent with the presumed role of Acly in the de novo lipogenesis required for myelin formation (14Elshourbagy N.A. Near J.C. Kmetz P.J. Sathe G.M. Southan C. Strickler J.E. Gross M. Young J.F. Wells T.N. Groot P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1430-1435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suspected that Acly expression in the brain would decrease in older animals, mirroring a reduced requirement for lipid synthesis (24Spady D.K. Dietschy J.M. J.

Physiol. 1998; 274: E1099-E1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suspicion was confirmed. In 3-week-old pups, β-galactosidase staining was less intense than in the 1-day-old mice, although staining was still observed in the hippocampus, thalamus, medulla, and the white matter of cerebellum (Fig. 7C). In 6-month-old mice, Acly was expressed at far lower levels in the brain than in the younger mice (Fig. 7D). In the adult mice, β-galactosidase was expressed in glial cells (Fig. 8A) and in neurons (Fig. 8B).Fig. 8Acly is expressed in glial cells and in neurons in the adult mouse nervous system.A and B, β-galactosidase and immunohistochemical staining of adult Acly+/- thalamus (A) and cortex (B).

However, the unknown number of individual Ets factors expressed in any cellular context and the similar DNA binding specificities of Ets family members complicates the identification of those that mediate transformation. By utilizing quantitative PCR assays for 25 mouse Ets factors, we analyzed the expression of essentially the entire Ets family in normal mammary tissue, mammary-related cell lines, and mammary tumors. In normal mammary tissue, 24 Ets factors were expressed. Even clonal derived cell lines expressed 14–20 Ets members. The most abundant Ets factor mRNAs measured in normal mammary tissue were Elk4, Elf1, and Ets2. Subtractive analysis of mammary tissue identified which Ets factors were predominantly expressed in the myeloid/lymphoid or epithelial cell compartments. Comparison of Ets factor expression in normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors identified significantly elevated expression of Pse/PDEF, Ese2/Elf5, Ese3/Ehf, TEL/Etv6, and Elf2/NERF in mammary tumors and confirmed previously reported alterations in expression of Ese1/Elf3 and the PEA3 subfamily. Expression of 13 Ets target genes, implicated in various aspects of tumor progression, was also analyzed. Altered expression of particular Ets target genes was significantly correlated with particular Ets factors (e.g. maspin and Ese2), suggesting specific in vivo regulatory roles. Together, this comprehensive analysis revealed unexpectedly diverse Ets family gene expression, characterized novel Ets factor changes in mammary tumors, and implicated specific Ets factors in the regulation of multiple genes involved in mammary tumor progression.

Together, this comprehensive analysis revealed unexpectedly diverse Ets family gene expression, characterized novel Ets factor changes in mammary tumors, and implicated specific Ets factors in the regulation of multiple genes involved in mammary tumor progression. The Ets family of transcription factors in mouse or humans is comprised of at least 26 unique family members that contain an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain called the Ets domain. The Ets family includes both transcriptional activators and repressors. These factors have been implicated as critical mediators of a wide range of cellular processes, including development, differentiation, growth, and transformation (reviewed in Ref. 1Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ets family members bind to similar sites containing a GGA(A/T) core sequence. The regulatory specificity of individual Ets family members comes from their pattern of expression, their modifications by signaling pathways, and interactions with partner proteins (1Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Although there has been substantial progress in understanding signaling pathways to individual Ets factors and their interactions with other proteins, information about the expression pattern of the whole Ets family is fragmentary. Studies of the expression pattern of a number of Ets factors have suggested that their expression is quite tissue-specific. However, despite potentially overlapping Ets factor function, even the broadest studies have characterized the expression of less than half of the known Ets family members in any single cell type or tissue (3Maroulakou I.G. Bowe D.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6432-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Barrett J.M. Puglia M.A. Singh G. Tozer R.G. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2002; 72: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).There are multiple lines of evidence indicating that Ets factors are important mediators of cellular transformation and tumor formation. This evidence includes association of Ets factor misregulation or fusion proteins with human cancers, the effects of Ets dominant negative constructs, and correlative expression studies in tumors (5Dittmer J. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: F1-F11PubMed Google Scholar, 6Arvand A. Denny C.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5747-5754Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 7Oikawa T. Yamada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 303: 11-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Experiments with various dominant negative constructs that inhibit Ets activity have shown that interfering with Ets factor function can reverse the transformed phenotype of a variety of mouse and human cell types (8Langer S.J.

Such Ets dominant negative studies have also demonstrated the importance of Ets factors in the transformed phenotype of breast cancer cell lines (12Sapi E. Flick M.B. Rodov S. Kacinski B.M.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, because Ets dominant negative constructs can broadly interfere with Ets family function (15Hever A. Oshima R.G. Hauser C.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), these studies do not identify which of the ∼26 Ets factors are key in transformation. Gene disruption analysis of individual Ets factors in tumors has been complicated by embryonic lethality (reviewed in Ref. 16Bartel F.O. Higuchi T. Spyropoulos D.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6443-6454Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, decreasing Ets2 by even half was shown to delay tumor formation in a mouse mammary tumor model (17Neznanov N. Man A.K. Yamamoto H. Hauser C.A. Cardiff R.D. Oshima R.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4242-4246PubMed Google Scholar).A number of significant changes in Ets family gene expression have been observed between normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. There is increased expression in mammary tumors of the three members of the Ets factor PEA3 subfamily, PEA3, ERM, and ER81 (14Shepherd T.G. Kockeritz L. Szrajber M.R. Muller W.J. Hassell J.A. Curr.

Hauser, manuscript in preparation. These observations imply there are a number of biologically important Ets target genes in breast cancers. Over 200 genes, whose products are involved in every aspect of cellular growth and metabolism, have been identified as Ets targets by various criteria (reviewed in Ref. 26Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6533-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Many of these studies demonstrate that overexpression of one or more Ets factors can regulate the expression of a reporter gene. Due to the similarity of Ets DNA-binding sites as well as the uncharacterized expression of most Ets family members, such experiments primarily provide evidence of potential function (2Sharrocks A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 27Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 9-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indeed, experimental overexpression of at least eight different Ets factors stimulates the expression of ErbB2/HER2/Neu (28Scott G.K. Chang C.H. Erny K.M. Xu F. Fredericks W.J. Rauscher Thor A.D. Benz C.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6490-6502Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Eckel K.L. Tentler J.J. Cappetta G.J. Diamond S.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A.

Ets factors also regulate the expression of several genes involved in tumor angiogenesis (30Sato Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and of many matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; PyMT, polyoma middle T antigen; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Cph, cyclophilin A; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; Q-PCR, quantitative PCR; Opn, osteopontin. 2The abbreviations used are: MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; PyMT, polyoma middle T antigen; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Cph, cyclophilin A; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; Q-PCR, quantitative PCR; Opn, osteopontin. associated with invasiveness (31Singh S. Barrett J. Sakata K. Tozer R.G. Singh G. Curr. Drug Targets. 2002; 3: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Because of the strong potential for overlapping function of Ets family members, a necessary step in understanding the role of individual Ets family members in cancers is to determine which Ets factors are present in the relevant cells and tissues. We have now measured the mRNA expression of essentially all the Ets gene family members in normal mammary tissue (mamma), several cellular compartments of normal mammary tissue, representative cell lines, and in mammary tumors arising in four different transgenic mouse mammary tumor models. We discovered that there was an unexpected large number of Ets factors expressed in all contexts, with 24 Ets factors expressed in whole mammary tissue and 14 or more Ets factors expressed even in clonal cell lines. Quantitative analysis revealed both anticipated and novel differences in the expression levels of multiple Ets factors between normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. When the expression of Ets factors in vivo was correlated with a variety of endogenous Ets target genes, several unexpected links between specific Ets members and targets such as maspin, ErbB2, and osteopontin were revealed. Overall, these studies provide new qualitative and quantitative insights into the expression pattern of the Ets family members and the changes that take place in the Ets family and their target genes in breast cancers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Tissues, and Tumors—The normal mouse mammary epithelial cell lines used in this study were NMuNg (32Owens R.B.

Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The MT1.2 cell line was a gift from Dr. Helene Baribault, who isolated this line by explanting an FVB/N-PyMT tumor into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 40 ng/ml dexamethasone, 10-4m 2-mercaptoethanol. The established cells were cloned, and a subclone resistant to puromycin was isolated by transfection with PGK-puro vector and puromycin selection. Antibody staining and RNase protection analysis revealed this line uniformly expressed simple epithelial keratins 8 and 18 but no longer expressed detectable levels of PyMT antigen RNA. The normal mamma, with or without the associated visible lymph node, were isolated from FVB/N 12-week-old virgin female mice. Surgically cleared number four mammary fat pads were prepared as described (35Young L.J.T. Ip M. Asch B. Methods in Mammary Gland Biology and Breast Cancer Research. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing Corp., New York2000: 67-74Crossref Google Scholar), and where indicated, the visible lymph node was removed. Mammary tumors were isolated from four previously described transgenic mice lines. MT mice express the polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) enhancer and rapidly develop multifocal mammary tumors (36Guy C.T. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). The PyMTdb mice are similar, except that they express PyMT with the Y315F/Y322F mutations, which disrupts PyMT signaling to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. These mice exhibit extended mammary tissue hyperplasia, and then form tumors despite increased apoptosis (37Webster M.A. Hutchinson J.N. Rauh M.J. Muthuswamy S.K. Anton M. Tortorice C.G. Cardiff R.D. Graham F.L. Hassell J.A. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2344-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The MMTV-cNeu line, originally called N#202, is an MMTV-driven cNeu transgenic line (38Guy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parsons T.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10578-10582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), and the NeuNT KI line contains an activated Neu allele inserted by homologous recombination into the normal ErbB2 locus (39Andrechek E.R. Hardy W.R. Siegel P.M. Rudnicki M.A. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Both of these transgenic lines form metastatic mammary tumors after an extended latency period.Isolation of RNA—Cell lines were grown to 80% confluency on 10-cm dishes. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed directly on the dishes with 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted from the cell line and precipitated as recommended by the manufacturer. RNA from normal mammary tissue was prepared tissue dissected from FVB/N mice. The mammary tissues were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in 1 ml of TRIzol, and RNA was prepared as with the cell lines. RNA from mammary tumors was prepared from dissected tumor pieces by the method of Chirgwin et al. (40Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16620) Google Scholar) with the modifications described previously (37Webster M.A. Hutchinson J.N. Rauh M.J. Muthuswamy S.K. Anton M. Tortorice C.G. Cardiff R.D. Graham F.L. Hassell J.A. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2344-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The concentration of total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically, or the purity and yield were estimated by ethidium bromide staining intensity of the 28 S RNA relative to standards, following electrophoresis on a 1% agarose TAE gel.cDNA Preparation—Residual genomic DNA in the RNA samples was degraded by DNase treatment, and the DNase was subsequently removed using the DNA-free kit (Ambion) as recommended by the manufacturer. Following DNase treatment of the RNA, it was confirmed that significant Q-PCR signals were not obtained with RNA that had not been reverse-transcribed to cDNA. To make cDNA, 4 μg of DNase-treated total RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)18 primer, SuperScript II enzyme, and other reagents in the SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis System kit (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 20 μl. The cDNA yield was analyzed by real time PCR analysis of the abundance of four different housekeeping genes, as described below. To establish that signals did not result from residual genomic DNA, it was confirmed that RNA samples that were not reverse-transcribed did not yield significant signals in the standard Q-PCR. The amount of cDNA used in a typical Q-PCR was made from 10 ng of whole RNA, which represents 500 cells, assuming 20 pg of RNA/cell.Primers and Primer Design—Standard unmodified primers of ∼20 nucleotides in length were obtained from either Genbase (San Diego) or Operon/Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Primers were designed using Primer 3 (41Rozen S. Skaletsky H.J. Krawetz S. Misener S. Bioinformatics Methods and Protocols: Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 365-386Google Scholar), a web-based primer design tool (www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi) using the default parameters, except the following: Tm, minimum 54, optimal 56, maximum 59; maximum 3′ self-complimentarity: 2; maximum poly(X), 4; GC clamp, 1. Primers were typically designed to amplify unique sequences within 1,000 bp of the 3′ end of the mRNA and, where feasible, to cross intron/exon boundaries. The primer sequences (5′ to 3′) of the sense (“L”) and the antisense (“R”) primers are shown for the Ets family, control genes, and Ets target genes in Table I. The only characterized mouse Ets factor omitted from our analysis was the B lymphocyte-specific Spi-B, due to sequence ambiguity and subsequent technical difficulty of PCR product specificity.Table IPrimers used for PCR analysisGeneaGene names used in this work.

To achieve hot start PCR, prior to assembling the Q-PCRs, each microliter of the master mix was incubated on ice for >5 min with 0.07 μl of TaqStart antibody (Clontech). A 10-μl Q-PCR contained 1 μl of cDNA (typically a 1:20 dilution of the cDNA stock) and 1 μl of antibody-inactivated SYBR green DNA master mix. The reaction also contained a final concentration of 4 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm of each primer and was brought to 10 μl with distilled water. The reaction mixtures were placed into capillaries and analyzed on a Roche Applied Science LightCycler real time PCR instrument. The amplification protocol consisted of an initial denaturation/antibody inactivation step at 95 °C for 70s, followed by 42 amplification cycles of 95 °C for 0 s, 56 °C for 7 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. Fluorescence was measured once at the end of each extension step. Melting analysis was performed after a final melting step at 95 °C for 0 s, followed by a 15 s annealing at 68 °C, and then increasing the temperature to 97° at 0.1°/s with continuous fluorescence measurements.Verification of Q-PCR Specificity—Three criteria were used to establish that the observed SYBR green I fluorescence measured in the LightCycler resulted from the specific amplification of the cDNA from each Ets family member. These were analysis of the Q-PCR product melting characteristics, length, and DNA sequence. For this analysis, 20-μl Q-PCR were performed with each of the primer pairs on a cDNA mixture derived from mouse lung, thymus, prostate, and testis RNA. A characteristic sharp melting peak of d(fluorescence)/dT at a specific temperature was determined for each specific PCR product, using the Roche Applied Science LightCycler software (version 3.3). For quantitation, the PCR products were then recovered from the capillaries and purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Following gel electrophoresis on a 2% NuSieve agarose 1% standard agarose TAE gel, the size and purity of each PCR product were analyzed. The fluorescence intensity of the ethidium bromide-stained gel band was used to determine the DNA concentration of the PCR product, using the AlphaImager 1200 CCD imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) and a standard curve generated from Low Mass markers (Invitrogen). Primer pairs that failed to yield a product with a single sharp melting peak or a single gel band of the anticipated size were discarded, and a new primer pair for that gene was designed and tested. Finally, the DNA sequences of the purified PCR products that met these two criteria were determined, using the appropriate L primer and standard automated fluorescent sequencing in the Burnham Institute Gene Analysis Core Facility. Each DNA sequence was subjected to BLAST analysis (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) to confirm that the PCR product represented the correct Ets family gene. Following this three-way validation, subsequent Q-PCR specificity was monitored by melting curve analysis of every Q-PCR product.Q-PCR Relative Expression Analysis—Initial analysis and normalization of the data were performed using LightCycler Analysis software version 3.3. In brief, after setting a noise band to exclude the non-linear portion of the amplification curves, this software determines a crossing point for each Q-PCR. This crossing point, similar to the crossing threshold (CT) of other software, can then be used in combination with a standard curve to calculate the concentration of each cDNA. For the relative analysis of gene expression, calculated concentration was based upon a standard curve relating GAPDH cDNA concentration to the CT, which was found to be linear over 5 orders of magnitude (Pearson correlation coefficient r > 0.99). A standard curve was generated for each experiment by analyzing serial dilutions of the cDNA sample with GAPDH primers. This relative CT-based analysis assumes equivalent PCR efficiency for other primer pairs in the log-linear phase of amplification, which subsequent analysi"

A p8-deficient mouse strain was generated as a tool to investigate its function. Upon induction of acute pancreatitis, myeloperoxidase activity in pancreas and serum concentrations of amylase and lipase were much higher and pancreatic lesions more severe in p8-deficient mice than in wild-type, indicating that p8 expression decreased pancreatic sensitivity to pancreatitis induction. The protective mechanism might involve the pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP I), whose strong induction during pancreatitis is p8-dependent, because administration of anti-PAP I antibodies to rats increased pancreatic inflammation during pancreatitis. In addition, 100 ng/ml PAP I in the culture medium of macrophages prevented their activation by tumor necrosis factor α, strongly suggesting that PAP I was an anti-inflammatory factor. Finally, PAP I was able to inhibit NFκB activation by tumor necrosis factor α, in macrophages and in the AR42J pancreatic acinar cell line. In conclusion, p8 improves pancreatic resistance to inducers of acute pancreatitis by a mechanism implicating the expression of the anti-inflammatory protein PAP I. p8 is a transcription cofactor whose expression is strongly and rapidly activated in pancreatic acinar cells during the acute phase of pancreatitis.

The pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, one of the most frequent diseases of the pancreas, is not fully understood yet. However, there is good evidence that autodigestion of the gland is involved. A still unknown triggering event converts, within the pancreas, digestive proenzymes into their active forms, leading to cell membrane disruption, edema, interstitial hemorrhage, necrosis, and to activation of other proenzymes. This mechanism is therefore self-propagating and can result in complete destruction of the parenchyma. Yet, most episodes of acute pancreatitis are self-limiting and remain mild. This is due to the rapid build up of pancreatic defense mechanisms involving important reorientation of the gene expression pattern. Genes encoding the potentially harmful digestive enzymes are down-regulated during the acute phase of pancreatitis whereas others, which help curb the extension of the disease, are strongly up-regulated (1Huttunen R. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1975; 10: 177-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Iovanna J. Keim V. Michel R. Dagorn J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: G418-G489Google Scholar). Hence, like other organs including the liver (3Kogure K. Kato H. Stroke. 1993; 24: 2121-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Baumann H. Gauldie J. Immunol.

In fact, expression of p8 was found induced in almost all tissues in response to stress (7Jiang Y.F. Vaccaro M.I. Fiedler F. Calvo E.L. Iovanna J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Secondary structure prediction methods revealed that a basic helix-loop-helix motif characteristic of certain transcription factors was present in the conserved regions of the 11 proteins (6Mallo G.V.

Although data base searches revealed no significant homology to any protein of known function, the mammalian p8 proteins share biochemical, biophysical, and DNA-binding properties with the HMG-I/Y family (11Encinar J.A.

An architectural role of p8 in transcription was proposed by analogy with the HMG-I/Y proteins, and actually received recent support (12Hoffmeister A. Ropolo A. Vasseur S. Mallo G.V. Bodeker H.

For instance, transforming growth factor β-1 induces p8 mRNA expression that in turn enhances the Smad-transactivating function responsible for transforming growth factor β-1 activity (13Garcia-Montero A.C.

Also, p8 is involved in cell cycle regulation as a growth promoter (6Mallo G.V. Fiedler F. Calvo E.L. Ortiz E.M. Vasseur S. Keim V. Morisset J. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol.

In addition, p8 is required for endothelin-induced mesangial cell hypertrophy in the diabetic kidney (16Goruppi S. Bonventre J.V. Kyriakis J.M.

Katzenberger J.D. Bauer M. Pankratz M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6162-6173Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Finally, a particularly attractive role in the control of tumor progression was proposed for p8 (19Ree A.H. Tvermyr M. Engebraaten O. Rooman M. Rosok O. Hovig E. Meza-Zepeda L.A. Bruland O.S.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). None of the functions listed above could easily be attributed to p8 in pancreas during the course of acute pancreatitis. Being strongly activated early in the development of pancreatitis, p8 could be a mediator of disease progression or, conversely, the first occurrence of a protective mechanism. It could also be a simple epiphenomenon. To investigate the role of p8 in vivo, we generated p8-deficient mice by gene targeting. We found that expression of p8 improves the pancreatic response to acute pancreatitis through enhancing the expression of the anti-inflammatory protein pancreatitis-associated protein (PAP) 1The abbreviations used are: PAP, pancreatitis-associated protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TAP, trypsinogen activation peptide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcriptase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; IL, interleukin. 1The abbreviations used are: PAP, pancreatitis-associated protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TAP, trypsinogen activation peptide; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; RT, reverse transcriptase; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; IL, interleukin.

Hoffmeister A. Garcia-Montero A. Mallo G.V. Feil R. Kuhbandner S. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Embryonic stem cells from three heterozygous clones for the mutated p8 allele were injected into blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice. We obtained in the littermates 7 highly chimerical male mice. They were intercrossed with wild-type C57BL/6 females and 4 showed germline transmission. Genotype identification was done by PCR and/or Southern blot with genomic DNA prepared from tail biopsies of 10-day-old mice. Heterozygous mice for the mutated p8 allele with mixed genetic background of C57/BL6 and SV129J strains were obtained and used in breeding experiments to generate p8-/- mice. p8-deficient mice were backcrossed to C57/BL6 mice for nine generations so that the p8-deficient mice used in this study have a background closer to that of C57/BL6 mice than to the original C57/BL6 X SV129J-F1 animals.Induction of Experimental Pancreatitis—Pancreatitis was induced in 4-month-old p8-/- and p8+/+ C57/BL6 mice weighing 20-24 g. After fasting for 18 h with access to water ad libitum, the secretagogue cerulein (Sigma) was administered as seven intraperitoneal injections of 50 μg/kg body weight at hourly intervals, as previously described (21Halangk W. Lerch M.M. Brandt-Nedelev B. Roth W. Ruthenbuerger M. Reinheckel T. Domschke W. Lippert H. Peters C. Deussing J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Saline-injected animals served as controls. All studies were performed in accordance with the European Union regulations for animal experiment.Preparation of Serum and Tissue Samples—Mice were sacrificed at several time intervals from 3 to 24 h following the first intraperitoneal injection of cerulein. Whole blood samples were centrifuged at 4 °C, and serum was stored at -80 °C for further studies. The pancreas was removed on ice, weighed, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. For measurement of pancreatic enzyme activities, tissue was thawed and homogenized in ice-cold medium containing 5 mm MOPS, 1 mm MgSO4, and 250 mm sucrose (pH 6.5). Samples were sonicated and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g. Sample preparation for trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) assay was performed as described previously (22Grady T. Saluja A.K. Kaiser A. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G20-G26PubMed Google Scholar), supplementing the tissue homogenate with 1 mm EDTA and 0.1% Triton X-100 and boiling the samples for 10 min. Supernatants generated at 16,000 × g for 5 min were used in subsequent assays. For the myeloperoxidase assay, samples were macerated with 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). Homogenates where then disrupted for 30 s using a Labsonic (B Braun) sonicator at 20% power and submitted to three cycles of snap freezing in dry ice and thawing before a final 30-s sonication. Samples were incubated at 60 °C for 2 h and then spun down at 4,000 × g for 12 min. Supernatants were collected for myeloperoxidase assay.Biochemical Assays—Amylase and lipase activities were determined with commercially available assays (Roche Biochemicals). TAP was assayed by ELISA (Biotrin, Dublin, Ireland). R110-(CBZ-Ile-Pro-Arg)2 and R110-(CBZ-Ala4)2 were used as substrates to monitor trypsin and elastase activities, respectively. Pancreatic homogenates were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates and the kinetics of proteolysis were recorded over 60 min at 37 °C by fluorometry using wavelengths of 485 nm for excitation, 515 nm as cutoff, and 530 nm for emission. To increase specificity, trypsin activity was expressed as the fraction of the increase in fluorescence that can be blocked by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm) and aprotinin (1 mm). Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase was measured with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate as previously described (24Folch E. Closa D. Prats N. Gelpí E. Rosello-Catafau J. Inflammation. 1998; 22: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was recorded at 630 nm. The assay mixture consisted of 20 μl of supernatant, 10 μl of tetramethylbenzidine (final concentration 1.6 mm) dissolved in Me2SO, and 70 μl of H2O2 (final concentration 3.0 mm) diluted in 80 mm phosphate buffer (pH 5.4).Quantitation of Cerulein-induced Injuries—To evaluate necrosis and inflammation in pancreas of p8-expressing and p8-deficient mice after cerulein-induced pancreatitis, formalin-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin and 5-μm sections were stained with hematoxilin and eosin. Coded sections were evaluated by light microscopy and scored by 3 experienced morphologists.Transfection and Overexpression of p8 cDNA—The full-length human p8 cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), downstream from the cytomegalovirus promoter, as previously reported (8Vasseur S. Vidal Mallo G. Fiedler F. Bodeker H. Canepa E. Moreno S. Iovanna J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 670-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid was named pcDNA3-hump8. As control, we used the empty pcDNA3 plasmid. The plasmids were transfected into AR42J cells using FuGENE reagent (Roche Diagnostics) as recommended by the manufacturer. To select for stable expression of the pcDNA3-hump8 and of empty pcDNA3, cells were cultivated over 3-4 weeks in media to which G418 (800 μg/ml) was added 48 h after transfection. Surviving colonies were pooled and maintained in standard culture medium supplemented with G418 (400 μg/ml).Expressions of PAP I, amylase, cathepsin B, and β-actin mRNA were monitored by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was used and the sequence amplified by the Invitrogen One Step RT-PCR system according to the manufacturer's protocol. For PAP I, the forward primer was 5′-CTCCTGCCTGATGCTCTTAT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TTGTTACTCCACTCCCATCC-3′; for amylase, the forward primer was 5′-AAAATTTGCTCAAGGTCTGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TTTATCGAGTGCAAGATCCA-3; for cathepsin B the forward primer was 5′-TGTCGGACGACATGATTAAC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CATTGGTGTGAATGCAGATT-3′; and for β -actin, a housekeeping gene used as control, the forward primer was 5′-CACGGCATTGTAACCAACTG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TCTCAGCTGTGGTGGTGAAG-3′. RT-PCR products were resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide.p8 Induces PAP I Expression by Activation of the Promoter—To monitor the induction by p8 of the PAP I promoter, we performed a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay, using the rat PAP I gene promoter (fragment -1253 to +10 from initiation) positioned upstream from the CAT reporter gene, as previously described (25Dusetti N.J. Ortiz E.M. Mallo G.V. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22417-22421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). One day after seeding AR42J cells stably transfected with pcDNA3-hump8 or the pcDNA3 empty plasmid at a density of 5 × 106 cells per 100-mm Petri dish, the PAP I promoter-CAT reporter construct was transfected using FuGENE reagent as described above. Twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested and extracts were prepared using the reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The pGL3 control plasmid (Promega), which contains the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the SV40 promoter, was used as a transfection control. CAT activity was determined using a phase extraction procedure and luciferase using the Luciferase assay reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Rat Model of Pancreatitis—Anesthesia was induced in male Wistar rats (250-300 g) by intraperitoneal injection of 10% urethane (1 ml/100 g). The biliopancreatic duct was cannulated through the duodenum and the hepatic duct was closed by a small bulldog clamp. Acute pancreatitis was induced by retrograde injection of sodium taurocholate (5%) in a volume of 0.1 ml/100 g. Control animals received an infusion of saline solution. In other experiments, animals received immediately after pancreatitis induction an intravenous administration of anti-PAP I IgGs (3 mg/kg) or, as control, Protein A-purified IgGs (3 mg/kg) obtained from non-immunized rabbits. Samples of pancreas where obtained 3 h after induction, immediately frozen and maintained at -80 °C until assayed.Western Blotting of PAP I—For Western blots, the pancreas of mice and rats were rapidly ground in liquid nitrogen. The resulting powder was reconstituted in an ice-cold solubilization buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris/HCl (pH 8), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma) at a concentration of 100 mg/ml. Samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Supernatants were recovered, and total amounts of protein were determined using the Bradford method. One hundred μg of protein from pancreas were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE then blotted following standard methods. Nonspecific binding to the membrane was blocked by 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an affinity purified rabbit anti-rat PAP I antibody (1:2500) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to human p8 (1:100) diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin. Then, membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton and incubated with a secondary goat anti-rabbit-HRPO antibody (1:5000) (Amersham Biosciences) diluted in 5% dry nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton, developed with the ECL detection system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), quickly dried and exposed to ECL film.Macrophage Isolation and Treatment—Alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage. Lungs where dissected free of the thoracic cavity and a small length of tubing was inserted into the trachea and ligated. Bronchoalveolar lavage was carried out with 10 ml of cold saline solution instilled and withdrawn from the lungs four times. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 400 × g and the pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were counted, cultured in 12-dish plates (106 cell/ml), incubated for 1 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air, and washed twice with warm medium to remove nonadherent cells. Twenty-four hours after cell isolation, cells were incubated with TNFα (50 ng/ml) or 0.1 μm fMLP with increasing doses of purified PAP I. After incubating 4 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air, total RNA was obtained to evaluate the changes in TNFα, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and β-actin mRNA concentrations by the semiquantitative RT-PCR method described above. For TNFα, the forward primer was 5′-ACTGAACTTCGGGGTGATTG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GTGGGTGAGGAGCACGTAGT-3′; for IL-6, the forward primer was 5′-CCGGAGAGGAGACTTCACAG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GAGCATTGGAAGTTGGGGTA-3. β-Actin was also used as a housekeeping control gene.Immunofluorescence Monitoring of NFκB—To determine NFκB translocation, macrophages or AR42J cells were incubated in coverslips overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. Cells were treated first with PAP I (100 ng/ml) for 10 min, then TNFα (50 ng/ml) or fMLP (0.1 μm) were added to the culture medium for 30 min. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at 4 °C and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline 5 min at room temperature. Saturation was obtained by incubating cells with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with anti-p65 NFκB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Slides were mounted with Mowiol, and NFκB localization in the cells was examined by fluorescence microscopy.ELISA for Activated NFκB—Activation of NFκB was measured with a commercial ELISA kit (TransAM, Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium). In this method, the transcription factor binds to an oligonucleotide containing a consensus NFκB binding site immobilized on a 96-well plate. It is detected by a primary antibody, which specifically recognizes an epitope accessible only when the factor is activated and bound to its target DNA. A secondary anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate allows detection of the activated NFκB-antibody complex by a colorimetric reaction.Statistical Analysis—Data shown in the figures indicate the mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were compared using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance test when more than two groups were compared. Asterisks in the figures indicate statistically significant differences (p < 0.05).RESULTSConstruction of a p8-/- Mouse Model—A p8 null allele was generated in 129/Sv embryonic stem cells by replacing exon 2 of the p8 gene by a neomycin-resistance cassette. Germline transmission was obtained after injection of these embryonic stem cells into C57BL/6 blastocysts. We then intercrossed mice heterozygous (p8+/-) for the targeted disruption to produce homozygous offsprings (p8-/-). These crosses provided litters of normal size, with living, and apparently normal p8-/- offsprings occurring at a frequency consistent with Mendelian inheritance. p8 deficiency was verified by RT-PCR and/or Southern blot analysis and by immunostaining of the pancreas with acute pancreatitis with a p8 polyclonal antibody (data not shown). Given these results and considering the size of the deletion, we concluded that the p8 mutation was null. p8-deficient mice showed normal phenotype at birth, without apparent neurological or behavioral deficits. Postnatal development was indistinguishable from that of heterozygous or wild-type littermates. We concluded that p8 was not involved in crucial developmental processes or that other genes were functionally redundant. Inspection of external and internal organs of p8-/- mice at different ages did not reveal any macroscopic abnormality. Histopathological investigation of pancreas showed an organization of Langerhans islets, secretory ducts, and acini quite similar to that of wild-type animals. p8-/- mice were fertile and reproduced normally. However, compared with wild-type, p8-deficient mice were more sensitive to the noxious effects of lipopolysaccharide with decreased survival, increased levels of serum TNFα and higher levels of myeloperoxidase and hydroperoxide in liver and pancreas. This suggests the implication of p8 in the defense mechanisms of these organs as recently published (26Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia-Montero A. Barthet M. Saint-Michel L. Berthezene P. Fiedler F. Closa D. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. BMC Gastroenterology. 2003; 3: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Using microarray DNA analysis of liver gene expression we demonstrated that lack of p8 perturbed the expression of a large number of genes (belonging to many cellular pathways), which were improperly up- or down-regulated upon lipopolysaccharide treatment. We concluded that p8, which is probably a transcription factor, is a key regulator of the cellular response to lipopolysaccharide. If its absence is apparently without important consequences in normal conditions, it prevents mice from fully developing their defense program against lipopolysaccharide challenge (26Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia-Montero A. Barthet M. Saint-Michel L. Berthezene P. Fiedler F. Closa D. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. BMC Gastroenterology. 2003; 3: 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have recently demonstrated that although p8-deficient mice develop normally, embryonic fibroblasts obtained from these mice show altered behavior compared with wild-type, p8-/- embryonic fibroblasts growing more rapidly under normal conditions and showing increased resistance to apoptosis after adriamycin-induced DNA damage (14Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia-Montero A. Mallo G.V. Feil R. Kuhbandner S. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1685-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We also showed that expression of p8 is required for development of tumors because transformed p8-deficient fibroblasts were unable to produce tumors in athymic nude mice when injected subcutaneously, contrary to transformed wild-type fibroblasts (20Vasseur S. Hoffmeister A. Garcia S. Bagnis C. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Cerulein-induced Pancreatitis Is More Severe in p8-/- Mice Than in Wild-type—As previously described (21Halangk W. Lerch M.M. Brandt-Nedelev B. Roth W. Ruthenbuerger M. Reinheckel T. Domschke W. Lippert H. Peters C. Deussing J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), wild-type mice given intraperitoneal injections of the secretagogue cerulein at a supramaximal dose develop acute necrotizing pancreatitis. We compared the severities of cerulein-induced pancreatitis in wild-type and p8 knock-out mice by measuring amylase and lipase levels in serum and by assessing the extent of acinar cell necrosis. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, pancreatitis induction was followed by a time-dependent rise in serum amylase and lipase activities, amylasemia and lipasemia being, however, 30 and 50% higher, respectively, in p8 knock-out mice than in wild type (Fig. 1). In addition, histological examination of pancreas sections showed more severe lesions (acinar cell injury/necrosis, edema, inflammation, and cellular vacuolization) in knock-out mice (Fig. 2 and Table I). Acute pancreatitis is therefore more severe in p8-deficient animals, compared with wild-type, suggesting a protective effect of p8. It is known that during acute pancreatitis, neutrophil accumulation increases pancreatic tissue damage. Neutrophil infiltration was assessed by monitoring in pancreas the activity of myeloperoxidase, an enzyme specifically found in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. On that basis, neutrophil sequestration appeared significantly higher in p8-deficient mice than in wild-type (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Acute pancreatitis is more severe in p8-/- mice. A, histologic sections of control pancreas and pancreas after 3 or 18 h following induction by cerulein of acute pancreatitis in p8+/+ and p8-/- mice. Note the significant increase in edema, infiltration, and necrosis in pancreas from p8-/- mice. Bar = 10 μm. B, pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity was measured in the pancreas of control p8+/+ and p8-/- mice and 3, 6, 12, 18, or 24 h following inductio"
https://openalex.org/W2074314874,"Oxidized lipoproteins may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Elevated levels of 3-chlorotyrosine, a specific end product of the reaction between hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and tyrosine residues of proteins, have been detected in atherosclerotic tissue. Thus, HOCl generated by the phagocyte enzyme myeloperoxidase represents one pathway for protein oxidation in humans. One important target of the myeloperoxidase pathway may be high density lipoprotein (HDL), which mobilizes cholesterol from artery wall cells. To determine whether activated phagocytes preferentially chlorinate specific sites in HDL, we used tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to analyze apolipoprotein A-I that had been oxidized by HOCl. The major site of chlorination was a single tyrosine residue located in one of the protein's YXXK motifs (where X represents a nonreactive amino acid). To investigate the mechanism of chlorination, we exposed synthetic peptides to HOCl. The peptides encompassed the amino acid sequences YKXXY, YXXKY, or YXXXY. MS/MS analysis demonstrated that chlorination of tyrosine in the peptides that contained lysine was regioselective and occurred in high yield if the substrate was KXXY or YXXK. NMR and MS analyses revealed that the Nϵ amino group of lysine was initially chlorinated, which suggests that chloramine formation is the first step in tyrosine chlorination. Molecular modeling of the YXXK motif in apolipoprotein A-I demonstrated that these tyrosine and lysine residues are adjacent on the same face of an amphipathic α-helix. Our observations suggest that HOCl selectively targets tyrosine residues that are suitably juxtaposed to primary amino groups in proteins. This mechanism might enable phagocytes to efficiently damage proteins when they destroy microbial proteins during infection or damage host tissue during inflammation.

This mechanism might enable phagocytes to efficiently damage proteins when they destroy microbial proteins during infection or damage host tissue during inflammation. Protein oxidation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases ranging from ischemia-reperfusion injury to atherosclerosis as well as in the aging process itself (1Marnett L.J. Riggins J.N. West J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, most studies of protein oxidation have focused on the vulnerability of individual amino acid side chains, including the phenolic group of tyrosine and the thiol groups of methionine and cysteine. Remarkably little is known about the influence of nearby residues or of specific sequence motifs on the susceptibility of protein-bound amino acid chains to oxidation. One example of such effects is the oxidation of specific cysteine residues in tyrosine phosphatases by hydrogen peroxide (2Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). This reaction, which affects phosphatase activity, is thought to rely on a high local concentration of positively charged amino acid side chains to stabilize the reactive anionic form of the thiol. Another example is the apparent effect of acidic and basic amino acid residues on protein nitrosation (3Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). However, an extensive study of model proteins oxidized by peroxynitrite revealed few obvious common features among the tyrosine residues that were targeted for nitration (4Souza J.M. Daikhin E. Yudkoff M. Raman C.S. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Recently, histidine and cysteine residues at the metal binding site have been identified as primary targets during metal-catalyzed oxidation of β-amyloid peptides and iron regulatory protein 2 (5Schoneich C.

HOCl readily oxidizes the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine, producing disulfides, oxyacids, sulfoxides, and compounds in which sulfur is cross-linked to nitrogen (22Pullar J.M.

However, other reactive species, such as hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite, can also generate oxygenated sulfur products (25Pryor W.A. Jin X. Squadrito G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HDL is believed to inhibit atherosclerosis by mobilizing excess cholesterol from cells of the artery wall, but oxidation of HDL has been proposed to alter its biological properties, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (30Francis G.A.

However, little is known about the vulnerability to chlorination of specific tyrosine residues in apolipoprotein A-I. HOCl also reacts with primary amino groups, producing primary (RNClH) and secondary (RNCl2) chloramines (37Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M.

HOCl+RNH2→RNCIH+H2O+HOCI⇆RNCl2+H2O Studies with free α-amino acids have shown that they form unstable α-amino chloramines, which are deaminated and decarboxylated into aldehydes (39Zgliczynski J.M.

In contrast, HOCl yields stable chloramines at the primary ϵ-amino group of lysine, which lacks an adjacent carboxylic acid (19Hazen S.L. d'Avignon A. Anderson M.M. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4997-5005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that N-centered radicals deriving from chloramines could contribute to protein fragmentation and tissue damage (42Hawkins C.L. Davies M.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Both HOCl and chloramines react with aromatic and unsaturated compounds to form chlorinated products (7Hurst J.K. Barrette Jr., W.C.

HOCl is in equilibrium with molecular chlorine, and this potent electrophile has been proposed to mediate the chlorination of free tyrosine (28Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It remains to be established whether this reaction pathway is relevant to the chlorination of protein-bound tyrosine residues. N-terminal chloramines have been proposed to be intermediates in the formation of 3-chlorotyrosine in synthetic peptides (27Domigan N.M. Charlton T.S. Duncan M.W. Winterbourn C.C. Kettle A.J. J.

However, little is known about the factors that control the site-specific chlorination of tyrosine residues in proteins. In the current study, we use HDL, synthetic peptides, and tandem mass spectrometric analysis to investigate the role of HOCl and chloramines in tyrosine chlorination. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), trifluoroacetic acid, and HPLC grade CH3CN and methanol were obtained from Fisher. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), free and acetylated amino acids, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid were purchased from Sigma. Peptides Ac-GYKRAYE (YKXXY), Ac-GEYARKY (YXXKY), and Ac-GEYAREY (YXXXY) were prepared by the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, Washington University (St. Louis, MO). Peptides Ac-PYSDELRQRLAARLE-NH2 (YXXXXX), Ac-PYSDELKQRLAARLE-NH2 (YXXXXK), Ac-PYSDEKLQRLAARLE-NH2 (YXXXKX), Ac-PYSDKELQRLAARLE-NH2 (YXXKXX), Ac-PYSKDELQRLAARLE-NH2 (YXKXXX) and Ac-PYKSDELQRLAARLE-NH2 (YKXXXX) were synthesized by GenScript Corp. (Scotch Plains, NJ). Purity of the peptides was confirmed by HPLC and mass spectrometric analysis. HDL Isolation—Plasma was prepared from blood anticoagulated with EDTA collected from healthy adults that had fasted overnight. HDL (density 1.125–1.210 g/ml) was prepared by sequential ultracentrifugation from plasma and was depleted of apolipoprotein E and apolipoprotein B100 by heparin-agarose chromatography (45Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation Reactions—Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 100 μm peptide or 1 mg/ml HDL protein. Reactions were initiated by adding oxidant and were terminated by the addition of a 10–50-fold molar excess of l-methionine. Concentrations of HOCl and H2O2 were determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ292 = 350 m-1 cm-1 and ϵ240 = 39.4 m-1 cm-1) (46Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 47Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The pH dependence of reactions was determined using buffers (100 mm) composed of phosphoric acid, monobasic sodium phosphate, dibasic sodium phosphate, and 100 mm NaCl. Protein was determined using the Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). HPLC Analysis of Peptides—Peptides were separated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min on a reverse-phase column (Beckman ODS; 4.6 × 250 mm) using a Beckman HPLC system (Fullerton, CA) with UV detection at 215 nm. The peptides were eluted using a gradient of solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O) and solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 90% CH3CN, 10% H2O). Solvent B was increased from 10 to 50% over 25 min. Isolation of Peptide-bound Chloramines—Ac-GEYARKY (100 μm) was incubated with HOCl (100 μm) in PBS (pH 7.4) for 2 min at room temperature, and the reaction mixture was subjected immediately to HPLC without methionine addition. The methionine-sensitive oxidation product was collected and stored on ice for further analysis. Oxidation of Lipid-associated Peptides—1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC)-associated peptides were prepared using a peptide/DPPC ratio of 1:20 (mol/mol). DPPC was dissolved in ethanol and dried under nitrogen. PBS was added, and the mixture was vortexed vigorously and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Vesicles were aliquoted and incubated with 25 μm peptides for 20 min at 37 °C. Peptides were oxidized with HOCl in PBS at 37 °C (0.5 and 1 mol of oxidant/mol of peptide, lipid-free and DPPC-associated, respectively). The reaction was stopped with excess methionine after 30 min. Proteolytic Digestion of Proteins—Native or HOCl-modified HDL was incubated overnight at 37 °C with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at a ratio of 25:1 (w/w) protein/trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8. Digestion was halted by acidification (pH 2–3) with trifluoroacetic acid. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS)—ESI-MS analyses were performed in the positive ion mode with a Finnigan Mat LCQ ion trap instrument (San Jose, CA) coupled to a Waters 2690 HPLC system (Milford, MA) (48Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41279-41287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides were separated at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min on a reverse-phase column (Beckman ODS; 2.1 × 250 mm) using a gradient of solvent A (0.2% HCOOH in H2O) and solvent B (0.2% HCOOH in 80% CH3CN, 20% H2O). Solvent B was increased from 10 to 50% over 25 min. Tryptic digests of HDL were separated at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min on a reverse-phase column (Vydac C18 MS; 2.1 × 250 mm). The electrospray needle was held at 4500 V. Nitrogen, the sheath gas, was set at 80 units. The collision gas was helium. The temperature of the heated capillary was 220 °C. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) Time-of-Flight (TOF) MS—MALDI-TOF-MS analyses were performed on a Voyager DE-STR (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in the reflectron mode using delayed ion extraction (49Wiley W.C. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1953; 26: 1150-1157Crossref Scopus (3096) Google Scholar). The accelerating voltage was 2.5 kV, the delay time was 300 ns, the mirror to accelerating voltage ratio was 1.12, and the low mass gate was 400 Da. Spectra (100 shots) were acquired with a laser power of 1850. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid plus CH3CN (1:1, v/v) was used as matrix. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were obtained on the peptide and the chloramine intermediate (3.6 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively) in 0.5 ml of PBS (10% D2O, 90% H2O, pH 7.4). The spectra were acquired on a Varian Unity INOVA-600 spectrometer (599.749 MHz for 1H) and processed using VNMR software (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). One-dimensional NMR experiments were carried out at 4 °C using presaturation or hard pulse WATERGATE sequences for water suppression (50Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). Spectra were obtained under the following conditions: preacquisition delay = 0.5 s, acquisition time = 1.416 s (16,000 complex data points), pulse width = 7.8 μs, spectral width = 5650.1 Hz and 2 ms 15 G/cm field gradient pulses. Total correlation spectroscopy experiments for peptides and peptide-bound chloramines were recorded using an MELV-17 mixing sequence of 100 ms flanked by two 2-ms trim pulses with 256 t1 and 2048 t2 data points. After two-dimensional Fourier transformation, the spectra resulted in 2048 × 2048 data points that were phase- and base line-corrected in both dimensions. HOCl Preferentially Chlorinates a Single Tyrosine Residue in Apolipoprotein A-I—The 10 amphipathic helices in apolipoprotein A-I, the major protein of HDL, are thought to play essential roles in lipid binding, lipoprotein stability, and reverse cholesterol transport (51Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Engler J.A. Borhani D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1531: 4-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Five of the seven tyrosine residues in apolipoprotein A-I are located in amphipathic helices (Fig. 1A). It is noteworthy that three of those tyrosines reside in aYXXK motif (Y29XXK32,Y192XXK195, and Y236XXK239; X = an amino acid unreactive with HOCl). Importantly, the helical wheel representation of amphipathic helices predicts that tyrosine and lysine residues in this motif will lie next to each other on the same face of the α-helix (Fig. 1B) (51Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Engler J.A. Borhani D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1531: 4-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We therefore used HDL to determine whether HOCl preferentially chlorinates specific tyrosine residues in proteins. Liquid chromatography (LC)-ESI-MS analysis of the trypsin digest of apolipoprotein A-I detected peptides that collectively covered ∼80% of the protein's sequence and included all seven peptides predicted to contain tyrosine. To determine which tyrosine residues can be chlorinated, we oxidized HDL with HOCl and used reconstructed ion chromatograms to detect (i) each of the peptides that contained tyrosine and (ii) any tyrosine-containing peptides that had gained 34 atomic mass units (addition of 1 chlorine and loss of 1 hydrogen). We exposed HDL to HOCl (80:1, mol/mol, oxidant/HDL particle) in a physiological buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate) at neutral pH for 120 min at 37 °C and then terminated the reaction with a 20-fold molar excess (relative to oxidant) of methionine. Because the average HDL3 particle contains 2 mol of apolipoprotein A-I (7 tyrosine residues, 243 amino acids) and 1 mol of apolipoprotein A-II (8 tyrosine residues, 154 amino acids), the ratio of oxidant to substrate (mol/mol) was ∼30:1 for apolipoproteins A-I and A-II, 3:1 for tyrosine residues, and 1:8 for total amino acids. After digesting unmodified and oxidized HDL with trypsin, we analyzed the resulting peptides. LC-ESI-MS and MS/MS analysis detected three tryptic peptides whose mass corresponded to the mass of the precursor peptide plus 34 atomic mass units, which suggests the formation of 3-chlorotyrosine (Table I). The three peptides came from residues 189–195 ([LAEYHAK + 34 atomic mass units + 2H]2+, m/z 433.2), residues 227–238 ([VSFLSALEEYTK + 34 atomic mass units + 2H]2+, m/z 710.9), and residues 28–40 ([DYVSQFEGSALGK + 34 atomic mass units + 2H]2+, m/z 717.9). Using LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis, we confirmed each peptide's sequence and showed that its tyrosine had been targeted for chlorination (data not shown). Quantification of the ion current of each precursor and product peptide using reconstructed ion chromatograms (Table I) indicated that the major tyrosine oxidation product was LAE(ClY)HAK (Fig. 2). Importantly, the tyrosine residue in this region of apolipoprotein A-I is located in a YXXK motif. The other chlorinated peptides were present at much lower levels. These findings indicate that HOCl chlorinates three of the seven tyrosines in apolipoprotein A-I (Table I) and that the major oxidation product (∼50% 3-chlorotyrosine) was located in the YXXK motif of LAEYHAK. The other two tyrosines were chlorinated in much lower yield (≤6% 3-chlorotyrosine); one of these tyrosine residues was also located in a YXXK motif (VSFLSALEEYTK[K], where [K] represents a lysine residue removed by trypsin). These observations suggest that the amino group of lysine might direct protein oxidation to specific sites.Table ILC-ESI-MS detection of peptides containing 3-chlorotyrosine in a tryptic digest of HDL exposed to HOCl HDL was exposed to HOCl (80:1, mol/mol, oxidant/HDL particle) for 120 min at 37 °C in PBS (pH 7.4). A tryptic digest of HDL proteins was analyzed by LC-ESI-MS and MS/MS. Chlorinated peptides were detected and quantified using reconstructed ion chromatograms of precursor and product peptides. Peptide sequences were confirmed using MS/MS. Results are representative of those found in three independent experiments.ResiduesSequencesPrecursor, m/zProduct, m/z[M + H]+[M + 2H]2+[M + 34 + H]+[M + 34 + 2H]2+YieldaValues are (mol of product peptide/mol of precursor peptide) × 100%13-23DLATVYVDVLK1235.7618.3NDbND, not detectableND28-40DYVSQFEGSALGK1400.7700.81434.7717.8297-106VQPYLDDFQK1252.6626.8NDND108-116WQEEMELYRcHOCl oxidizes methionine to methionine sulfoxide (34)1283.6642.3NDND108-116WQEEM(O)ELYRcHOCl oxidizes methionine to methionine sulfoxide (34)1299.6650.3NDND161-171THLAPYSDELR1301.6651.3NDND189-195LAEYHAK831.4416.2865.4433.252227-238VSFLSALEEYTK1386.7693.91420.7710.96a Values are (mol of product peptide/mol of precursor peptide) × 100b ND, not detectablec HOCl oxidizes methionine to methionine sulfoxide (34Bergt C.

We included lysine in two of the peptides because it has a primary ϵ-amino group that forms a long lived chloramine when exposed to HOCl (19Hazen S.L. d'Avignon A. Anderson M.M. Hsu F.F.

The three peptides contained the same amino acids (acetyl-Gly, -Tyr2, -Lys, -Arg, -Ala, and -Glu), including glutamic acid, but the last replaced lysine in YXXXY. Glutamic acid was included because its negative charge ensures aqueous solubility. Arginine was included because its positive charge promotes peptide ionization during mass spectrometric analysis. The acetyl group on the N terminus prevented the primary amine from forming a chloramine. We exposed each peptide to HOCl (1:1, mol/mol) in a physiological buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, terminated the reaction with methionine, and analyzed the reaction"

It was recently reported that IRAK-M negatively regulates TLR signaling. In this study, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms of tolerance induced by PGN, with a focus on the role of IRAK-M. We demonstrate that pretreatment of macrophage RAW264.7 cells with a high concentration (30 μg/ml) of PGN for 16 h effectively induces tolerance against following stimulation with 30 μg/ml of PGN; while pretreatment with a low concentration (1 μg/ml) of PGN does not. IRAK-M is induced in cells treated with the high concentration of PGN 4–24 h after PGN stimulation, but not in cells treated with the low concentration of PGN up to 24 h after stimulation. Phosphorylation of MAPKs and IκBα is inhibited after the second PGN stimulation in tolerant cells. Kinase activity of IRAK-1 and association between IRAK-1 and MyD88 are also suppressed in PGN-induced tolerant cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of IRAK-M expression by small interfering RNAs specific for IRAK-M reinstates the production of TNF-α after PGN restimulation.

The cytoplasmic portion of TLRs is very similar to that of the IL-1 receptor family and is currently referred to as the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain. The signaling pathway via the TLR family is highly homologous to that via the IL-1 receptor family. TLR interacts with adaptor protein MyD88, which recruits IRAK (2Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T.

Cell. 1988; 52: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). IRAK becomes activated and associates with TRAF6, leading to the activation of several distinct signaling pathways, including MAPKs and NF-κB (4Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). Many reports have been published on the reduced capacity of circulating leukocytes from septic patients to produce cytokines as compared with those from healthy controls, a phenomenon referred to as “endotoxin tolerance.” It is an adaptive host response that may represent an essential regulatory mechanism during Gram-negative bacterial infection, but it may also promote subsequent infection in survivors of septic shock (5Zeisberger E.

Blood. 1995; 85: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytes from septic patients have a reduced capacity to release TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 (12Munoz C. Carlet J. Fitting C.

Steckholzer U. Kremer J.P. Ungethuem U. Trentz O. Blood. 1997; 89: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A defect in the activation of transcription factor NF-κB also has been reported in endotoxin tolerance (15Adib-Conquy M. Adrie C. Moine P. Asehnoune K. Fitting C. Pinsky M.R. Dhainaut J.F. Cavaillon J.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 1877-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the septic shock syndrome is critical, yet despite numerous studies little is known about these mechanisms. One of the main characteristics of endotoxin tolerance in vitro is a change in the pattern of inflammatory gene expression in cells of myeloid lineage (16Henricson B.E. Neta R. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1188-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas inhibition of cell surface expression of the TLR4/MD-2 complex has been suggested to underlie LPS tolerance in mouse macrophages (17Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Nakanishi K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), LPS induces tolerance in CHO cells without affecting cell surface expression of transfected TLR4 and MD-2 (18Medvedev A.E. Henneke P. Schromm A. Lien E. Ingalls R. Fenton M.J. Golenbock D.T. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, LPS-tolerant cells exhibit significantly suppressed LPS-induced activation and degradation of IRAK and diminished IRAK-MyD88 association (19Li L. Cousart S. Hu J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These data imply that tolerance induction may affect the expression and/or functions of intracellular intermediates downstream of TLRs (20Medvedev A.E. Lentschat A. Wahl L.M. Golenbock D.T. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5209-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Induction of an endotoxin-tolerant phenotype is not specific to the initiating action of LPS, because engagement of TLR/IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) family members other than TLR4, also results in macrophage resistance to subsequent challenge with respective ligands. However, the molecular mechanisms that induce homotolerance by PAPMs recognized by TLR2, such as PGN and LTA, are largely unknown. THP-1 cells with prolonged LTA treatment develop LTA homotolerance. Stimulation of TLR2 by LTA, although activating IRAK, does not cause IRAK degradation, indicating that molecular mechanism underlying LTA-induced tolerance is clearly distinct from that of LPS-induced tolerance (21Jacinto R. Hartung T. McCall C. Li L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6136-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is speculated that disruption of unique TLR2 signaling components may occur upstream of MyD88/IRAK (21Jacinto R. Hartung T. McCall C. Li L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6136-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). IRAK was originally described as a signal transducer for the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1, and was later implicated in signal transduction of other members of the TLR/IL-1R family. To date, four different IRAK-like molecules have been identified: two active kinases, IRAK-1 and IRAK-4, and two inactive kinases, IRAK-2 and IRAK-M. All IRAKs mediate activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways (22Janssens S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all IRAKs have been shown to act downstream of MyD88 and be capable of binding to TRAF6 (23Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 24Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Among four IRAKs, IRAK-M is highly restricted to monocytes/macrophages, and initial reports indicated that IRAK-M activates NF-κB when overexpressed in 293T cells and partially restores IL-1 signaling in IRAK–/– cells (23Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 27Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). However, recent reports state that innate immunity was strongly enhanced in IRAK-M–/– mice, and IRAK-M–/– cells have strikingly impaired endotoxin tolerance, showing that IRAK-M negatively regulates TLR signaling (28Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 191-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Despite potential importance of IRAK-M in signaling via TLRs, however, the relationship between IRAK-M and TLR-mediated tolerance has been fully obscure. In this study we elucidate the molecular mechanisms of homotolerance induced by PGN, with a focus on the role of IRAK-M. Reagents and Antibodies—Anti-extracellular-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (anti-ERK), anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-IRAK-1, and anti-MyD88 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphospecific antibodies for p38, JNK, and IκBα were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-murine TLR2 antibody was purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). IRAK-M antibody was purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA) (28Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 191-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Antibody specific for β-actin was obtained from Abcam. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Dako (Denmark). Peptidoglycan from Staphylococcus aureus was purchased from Fluka, and the endotoxin level in the peptidoglycan was less than 0.5 pg/ml in culture medium as determined by a Limulus amehocyte lysate (LAL) assay. Cell Culture—RAW264.7, a murine macrophage-like cell line, was obtained from the ATCC, and was maintained in Eagle's modified minimal essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin (ICN, Aurora, OH), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with 1 or 30 μg/ml of peptidoglycan (PGN) at 37 °C. PGN stimulation was stopped by addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then lysed for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as previously reported (29Okugawa S. Ota Y. Kitazawa T. Nakayama K. Yanagimoto S. Tsukada K. Kawada M. Kimura S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C399-408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and cell membrane fractions were prepared as reported previously (30Bhat N. Perera P.Y. Carboni J.M. Blanco J. Golenbock D.T. Mayadas T.N. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7335-7342PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation studies, cell lysates were mixed with the indicated antibodies for 1 h. Cell lysates were then mixed with protein G and coupled Sepharose beads and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. After the beads were washed 3 times with ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, the precipitated proteins were boiled for 5 min and eluted with sodium dodecyl sulfate, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer. For the precipitation of total-cell lysates, cells were lysed directly by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitated proteins and total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and were electrically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS (Tris-buffered saline) buffer. The membrane was then incubated with the indicated antibody, and the reactive bands were visualized with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody via an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of TNF-α Production—The production of TNF-α was analyzed using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. RAW264.7 cells were seeded at a density of 105/ml in 24-well plates, and the supernatants collected 24 h after LPS stimulation. The concentration of TNF-α was measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). In Vitro IRAK-1 Kinase Assay—The IRAK-1 kinase assay was conducted as described previously (19Li L. Cousart S. Hu J. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 20Medvedev A.E. Lentschat A. Wahl L.M. Golenbock D.T. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5209-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunoprecipitated IRAK-1 complexes were washed four times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES at pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2,20mm glycerophosphate, 20 mm paranitrophenylphosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm benzamidine). Fifty microliters of kinase buffer were then added to each sample, supplemented with 5 μm ATP, 1 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP; Sigma), and 1 μl of [32P]ATP, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Ten microliters of SDS sample buffer was added, and the samples incubated at 50 °C for 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Constructions and Transfection of Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs)— The constructions of siRNA molecules were analyzed by B-Bridge International Inc. The oligonucleotide sequences used in the experiments were as follows: 5′-TGGACATTCGAAACCAAGCATAT-3′ (584–606); 5′-TTCCAGTGCAAACATACTCTTGG-3′ (921–943); 5′-TAATGTCCCAAGTATTCCAGTAG-3′ (1455–1477); 5′-AAGTCCTACTGTGATCAGTTT-3′ (1701–1721). They were synthesized by and purchased from Qiagen. The control RNAs were obtained from Dharmacon. Cocktails of in vitro synthesized siRNAs or control RNAs were transfected into RAW264.7 cells using RNAifect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were incubated in 10% fetal bovine serum for 24-h post-transfection and then stimulated with PGN as described above. Tolerance Induced by Pretreatment with High Concentrations of PGN—Fig. 1A shows the dose response curve of TNF-α production by PGN. Levels of TNF-α in the supernatants increased in a dose-dependent manner: a small amount of TNF-α production was observed in cells stimulated with less than 3 μg/ml PGN, while maximal TNF-α production was obtained by stimulation with more than 30 μg/ml PGN. To determine the threshold of tolerance induction by PGN, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with graded concentrations of PGN for 16 h and then restimulated with 30 μg/ml PGN for additional 16 h. TNF-α production was augmented in cells pretreated with less than 3 μg/ml PGN. In contrast, prior exposure to more than 30 μg/ml PGN markedly suppressed the ability of cells to produce TNF-α in respond to PGN (Fig. 1B). These data showed the existence of threshold of PGN concentration in the tolerance induction; pretreatment of cells with higher concentrations of PGN (≥30 μg/ml) for 16 h effectively induced PGN tolerance, while pretreatment with lower concentrations of PGN (<3 μg/ml) did not. In the subsequent experiments, we chose 1 μg/ml and 30 μg/ml of PGN as the low and high concentration of stimulation, respectively. Phosphorylation of MAPKs and IκB-α Was Inhibited in PGN-induced Tolerant Cells—In the next series of experiments, we compared the time kinetics of phosphorylation of MAPKs (ERK, p38, and JNK) and IκBα between cells stimulated with 1 and 30 μg/ml PGN. As shown in Fig. 2A, phosphorylation of these molecules was observed in cells treated with 30 μg/ml PGN 15–30 min after addition. PGN-induced phosphorylation of the MAPKs and IκBα was also observed in cells treated with 1 μg/ml PGN, although the intensity of the phosphorylation was much weaker in these cells. Fig. 2B shows time kinetics of PGN-induced phosphorylation of MAPKs and IκBα in cells pretreated for 16 h with 1 μg/ml PGN (PGN-non-tolerant cells) and 30 μg/ml PGN (PGN-tolerant cells). Phosphorylation of MAPKs and IκBα was observed in non-tolerant cells after the second stimulation with 30 μg/ml PGN, but hardly detected in tolerant cells. These results demonstrate that activation of intracellular signaling molecules such as MAPKs and IκBα is exclusively inhibited after the second PGN stimulation in tolerant cells. Surface Expression Levels of TLR2 Were Not Affected by PGN Stimulation—We then compared the expression levels of TLR2 between cells treated with a low and high concentrations of PGN. The expression levels of TLR2 in the membrane fraction in cells stimulated with a high concentration of PGN were similar to those in cells stimulated with a low concentration up to 16 h after PGN stimulation (Fig. 3). These results indicated that levels of TLR2 expression in the tolerant cells were not different from those in the non-tolerant cells. IRAK-1 Kinase Activity Was Inhibited in PGN-induced Tolerant Cells—By using the kinase assay, we examined IRAK-1 activation after PGN stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4A, in resting cells stimulation with both 1 and 30 μg/ml PGN increased IRAK-1 kinase activity, which was markedly up-regulated at 15 min and decreased at 60 min after stimulation. However, kinase activity of IRAK-1 was much stronger in cells treated with 30 μg/ml PGN than that in cells treated with 1 μg/ml PGN. We also examined whether IRAK-1 is phosphorylated by stimulation with each concentration of PGN. However, IRAK-1 phosphorylation was not observed even in cells treated with 30 μg/ml PGN (date not shown). Fig. 4B exhibited the induction of kinase activity of IRAK-1 in PGN-induced non-tolerant and tolerant cells. We observed that kinase activity of IRAK-1 was augmented in non-tolerant cells 15 min after second PGN stimulation, but suppressed in PGN tolerant cells (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylation of IRAK-1 was also examined, however, it was not observed for up to 60 min in both cells (date not shown). These results demonstrate that activation of IRAK-1 is exclusively inhibited after the second PGN stimulation in tolerant cells. Induction of IRAK-M and Inhibition of the Association between MyD88 and IRAK-1 in PGN Tolerant Cells—Previous studies have reported that IRAK-M negatively regulates TLR signaling (28Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 191-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar); however, the role of IRAK-M in TLR-mediated tolerance remains fully obscure. Therefore, we compared the time kinetics of expression of IRAK-M in cells treated with 1 and 30 μg/ml PGN. As shown in Fig. 5A, the bands corresponding to IRAK-M were not observed in unstimulated cells, indicating little constitutive expression of IRAK-M in resting cells. IRAK-M expression was also not observed in cells stimulated with a low concentration of PGN up to 24 h after stimulation. However, weak but significant expression of IRAK-M was observed in cells treated with a high concentration of PGN 4 h after stimulation. We speculate that the upper bands correspond to phosphorylated IRAK-M. In cells treated with a high concentration of PGN, apparent expression of phosphorylated IRAK-M was observed after 16 h of stimulation, which were slightly augmented 24 h after PGN stimulation (Fig. 5A). These results suggested that IRAK-M expression was only slightly induced, if any, in non-tolerant cells, while was apparently induced in tolerant cells. The time course of IRAK-1 protein expression was also studied by Western blotting in these cells. However, we found no significant difference in the protein levels of IRAK-1 between cells treated with 1 or 30 μg/ml PGN during 24 h stimulation, although expression levels appeared to decrease slightly in 2–4 h in both cells (Fig. 5A). These results collectively indicated that IRAK-1 was not degraded after PGN stimulation. We finally examined the association between IRAK-1 and MyD88 after restimulation with 30 μg/ml PGN in tolerant and non-tolerant cells. Association between IRAK-1 and MyD88 was clearly enhanced in PGN non-tolerant cells after the second PGN stimulation, but was barely detected in PGN tolerant cells (Fig. 5B), indicating that IRAK-1 is not recruited to the receptor/MyD88 complexes in PGN-induced tolerant cells. Specific Down-regulation of IRAK-M Reinstated the Production of TNF-α after PGN Restimulation—Finally, we examined whether experimental modulation of IRAK-M expression would alter PGN-induced tolerance. As shown in Fig. 6A, IRAK-M was induced 16–24 h after PGN stimulation in cells transfected with control RNAs. However, its expression was downregulated in cells transfected with a mixture of four specific siRNAs for IRAK-M (Fig. 6A). The intensity of the bands of IRAK-M in siRNA-transfected cells was about 30% of the controls cells (24 h) as judged by a densitometric analysis. In addition, TNF-α production was inhibited in control cells pretreated with and restimulated with 30 μg/ml of PGN, whereas it was reinstated in cells transfected with IRAK-M siRNAs, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). These results collectively indicated that down-regulation of IRAK-M expression altered PGN-induced tolerance. Multiple microbial stimulants can induce a wide array of gene expressions through the TLRs. Activation of TLRs subsequently lead to common downstream signaling events, including MyD88/IRAK kinase, MAPKs and NF-κB activation, which contribute to the production of TNF-α. With regard to the common signaling pathway that leads to TNF-α production, prolonged treatment with microbial stimulants has been shown to induce a state of tolerance characterized by decreased TNF-α production upon subsequent challenge (31Lehner M.D. Morath S. Michelsen K.S. Schumann R.R. Hartung T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5161-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 32McCall C.E. Grosso-Wilmoth L.M. LaRue K. Guzman R.N. Cousart S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Despite numerous studies, however, the molecular mechanism of endotoxin tolerance still remains to be solved, which probably involves down-regulation of multiple TLR signaling components, including down-regulation of the TLR4 receptor, disruption and degradation of IRAK, and reduced activation of MAPKs (17Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Nakanishi K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3476-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 33Kraatz J. Clair L. Rodriguez J.L. West M.A. Shock. 1999; 11: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Endotoxin tolerance is not limited to the potent TLR4 agonist, but also targets signaling initialized by agonists recognized by other members of the Toll/IL-1R family (18Medvedev A.E. Henneke P. Schromm A. Lien E. Ingalls R. Fenton M.J. Golenbock D.T. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Lehner M.D. Morath S. Michelsen K.S. Schumann R.R.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 7096-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Among PAMP-induced tolerance, LPS-mediated homo-tolerance has been most extensively studied. Although molecular mechanisms of TLR4-mediated tolerance have still remained to be fully clarified, numerous studies have revealed the involvement of down-regulation of multiple TLR signaling components, including down-regulation of TLR4 receptor expression, disruption and degradation of IRAK, and reduced activation of MAPKs, in LPS-mediated homotolerance. On the other hand, little information was available for TLR2-mediated homotolerance. Previous reports state that prolonged LTA treatment of murine monocytes/macrophages and human THP-1 cells can develop similar hyporesponsiveness in TNF-α production to subsequent LTA stimulation (21Jacinto R. Hartung T. McCall C. Li L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6136-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Lehner M.D. Morath S. Michelsen K.S. Schumann R.R. Hartung T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5161-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In this study, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms of PGN homotolerance. We found that pretreatment with low concentrations of PGN (≤3 μg/ml) for 16 h did not induce PGN homotolerance against following addition of 30 μg/ml PGN as assessed by TNF-α production (Fig. 1B). In fact, TNF-α production was rather promoted in these cases. On the other hand, pretreatment with high concentrations of PGN (≥10 μg/ml) for 16 h did clearly induce PGN tolerance (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, cells treated with high concentrations of PGN (≥10 μg/ml) for 4 h also became tolerant against subsequent PGN stimulation (date not shown). When phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules was compared between non-tolerant and tolerant cells, phosphorylation of MAPKs and IκBα was exclusively suppressed in PGN-induced tolerant cells (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the intensity of phosphorylation of MAPKs and IκBα is well correlated with TNF-α production, implying that phosphorylation of these molecules is also a good indicator for estimating the tolerant state. LTA-tolerant THP-1 cells are not totally unresponsive to subsequent LTA challenge. Instead, LTA-tolerant cells are capable of responding to further LTA treatment, indicating that the TLR2 receptor is still functional in LTA-tolerant cells (21Jacinto R. Hartung T. McCall C. Li L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6136-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It is speculated that the decreased expression of inflammatory proteins such as TNF-α is likely due to disruption of intracellular signaling components downstream of the TLR2 receptor (21Jacinto R. Hartung T. McCall C. Li L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6136-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We show that the expression level of TLR2 protein localized in the membrane fraction in tolerant cells is similar to that in non-tolerant cells (Fig. 3), indicating that the expression levels of receptors do not account for the tolerant state. A previous report showed that IRAK kinase activation and TNF-α protein production were inhibited in LTA-tolerant cells (31Lehner M.D. Morath S. Michelsen K.S. Schumann R.R. Hartung T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5161-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). LPS treatment induces rapid degradation as well as inactivation of IRAK (19Li L. Cousart S. Hu J. McCall C.E. J. Biol.

Reduced IRAK-1 kinase activity in LPS-tolerant human and murine macrophages has been described previously (17Nomura F. Akashi S. Sakao Y. Sato S. Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Nakanishi K. Kimoto M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23340-23345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, the IRAK protein level does not decrease following prolonged LTA treatment (21Jacinto R. Hartung T. McCall C. Li L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6136-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our presented results demonstrated that stimulation with a high concentration of PGN induced strong IRAK-1 kinase activation in resting cells (Fig. 4A). However, the same stimulation causes the suppression of kinase activity of IRAK-1 in PGN-induced tolerant cells, while it was retained in non-tolerant cells (Fig. 4B). We examined protein levels of IRAK-1 after PGN stimulation, and found that no significant differences occur in cells treated with either a low or high concentration of PGN (Fig. 5A), suggesting that IRAK-1 is activated without degradation, results that agree with previous reports on LTA-induced tolerance (21Jacinto R. Hartung T. McCall C. Li L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6136-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). IRAK-M is preferentially expressed in monocytes/macrophages (23Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), and recent studies have reported that IRAK-M plays a critical negative regulatory role in signaling via TLRs in these cells. IRAK-M–/– macrophages stimulated with known TLR agonists such as LPS or CpG DNA displayed increased NF-κB and MAPK activation. IRAK-M–/– mice showed increased inflammatory responses to bacterial infection (28Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 191-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). In the present study, we for the first time examined IRAK-M in PGN tolerance. We showed that IRAK-M protein is not detected in cells treated with a low concentration of PGN before and up to 24 h after stimulation (Fig. 5A), suggesting that IRAK-M expression is very low. However, IRAK-M was induced in cells treated with a high concentration of PGN 4–24 h after stimulation, implying that induction of IRAK-M is correlated with PGN-induced tolerance. Furthermore, down-regulation of IRAK-M expression by siRNAs specific for IRAK-M reinstated the production of TNF-α (Fig. 6). These results suggest that induction of IRAK-M is crucial to PGN-induced tolerance in macrophages. MyD88 is essential for TNF-α secretion in response to TLR agonists (37Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar), and association of MyD88 with TLR has been acknowledged as an essential step in signaling via various TLRs. Although the role of MyD88 is fully unknown in TLR-2-mediated tolerance, a recent report demonstrated that LPS-induced tolerance is mediated a failure of MyD88 to associate with TLR4 (20Medvedev A.E. Lentschat A. Wahl L.M. Golenbock D.T. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5209-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the complex between MyD88 and IRAK-1 is barely detectable after a second PGN stimulation in tolerant cells, while the complex between MyD88 and IRAK-1 is augmented in non-tolerant cells (Fig. 5B). These results collectively indicate that interception of recruitment of IRAK-1 to the TLR2/MyD88 complex is an important molecular mechanism of PGN-induced tolerance. One possible scenario is that in tolerant cells, IRAK-M induced by a high concentration of PGN inhibits the activation of IRAK-1 and interferes with the association between IRAK-1 and MyD88. LPS/TLR4 signaling can recruit the specific adaptor protein(s) that leads to IRAK phosphorylation and subsequent degradation, whereas TLR2 signaling recruits adaptor(s) that lead only to IRAK activation, but not phosphorylation/degradation. LTA cannot induce IRAK phosphorylation because IRAK phosphorylation is a prerequisite for subsequent degradation (21Jacinto R. Hartung T. McCall C. Li L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6136-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our results that IRAK-1 is activated but not degraded in a PGN-induced tolerance model agree with the previous report of LTA tolerance. IRAK activation and phosphorylation may be two independent events controlled by distinct regulatory steps, as speculated by Jacinto et al. (21Jacinto R. Hartung T. McCall C. Li L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6136-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We have not elucidated the molecular mechanisms that regulate protein expression of IRAK-M and by which IRAK-M regulates IRAK-4, because IRAK-M is reported to inhibit dissociation of IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 from the TLR signaling complex by either preventing phosphorylation of IRAK and IRAK-4 or stabilizing the TLR/MyD88/IRAK complex (28Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 191-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our novel finding that IRAK-M is specifically induced in PGN-mediated tolerant state may be important for understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tolerance. Prevention of IRAK-1 activation is an important molecular mechanism of PGN-induced tolerance. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tolerance may aid development of improved treatments for inflammatory responses that lead to sepsis. We thank M.

Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephs) 1The abbreviations used are: Ephs, ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases; ECD, extracellular domain; EGF, epidermal growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; w/t, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein. are activated through interaction with cell surface-bound ephrin proteins. Binding preferences and structural features classify eight type A Ephs interacting with six type A ephrins that attach to the membrane via glycophosphatidylinositol, as well as six type B Ephs interacting with corresponding type B transmembrane ephrins, which contain conserved cytoplasmic domains (1Lemke G.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5614-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In many cases Eph signaling results in cytoskeletal collapse, down-regulation of cell-cell adhesion proteins, and cell rounding (2Boyd A.W. Lackmann M.

Science. 2000; 289: 1360-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) leads to cell-cell detachment and repulsion. Interestingly, Eph/ephrin interactions can also promote cell adhesion, a dichotomy of function that has been widely recognized (2Boyd A.W. Lackmann M.

Ephs have a highly conserved domain structure throughout the animal kingdom (9Drescher U. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain (ECD) consists of a unique N-terminal globular structure, necessary and sufficient for ephrin binding (10Labrador J.P. Brambilla R. Klein R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3889-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Lackmann M. Oates A.C. Dottori M. Smith F.M. Do C. Power M. Kravets L. Boyd A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20228-20237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), followed by a cysteine-rich linker, an EGF-like motif, and two type II fibronectin domains. For human EphA3 (12Wicks I.P. Wilkinson D. Salvaris E. Boyd A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), these regions span amino acid sequence positions 29-203, 204-260, 271-324, 325-435, and 435-531, respectively. The minimal N-terminal globular domain has a β jellyroll-like architecture (13Himanen J.P. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas structures of the cysteine-rich linker and adjoining EGF motif have not been solved to date. Clearly, all Eph/ephrin signaling is initiated by a 1:1 interaction between the globular Eph domain and a conserved Eph-binding domain of the ephrins (14Lackmann M. Mann R.J. Kravets L. Smith F.M. Bucci T.A. Maxwell K.F. Howlett G.J. Olsson J.E. Vanden Bos T. Cerretti D.P. Boyd A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16521-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, functional studies have indicated that biological responses rely on oligomerized ephrins to assemble active Eph receptor clusters capable of triggering downstream signaling cascades (15Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 266: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 16Stein E. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Schoecklmann H.O. Schroff A.D. Van Etten R.L. Daniel T.O. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In agreement, the x-ray crystal structure of the complexed EphB2 and ephrin-B2 interaction domains (17Himanen J.P. Rajashankar K.R. Lackmann M. Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) reveals a 2:2 heterotetramer, containing two types of ligand-receptor contacts of apparent higher affinity (mediating heterodimerization) and lower affinity (mediating heterotetramerization). This configuration of Eph and ephrin domains, where ephrin and Eph C termini are positioned on opposite sites of a ring-like planar structure, illustrates how membrane-associated ephrins and Eph receptors can initiate bi-directional signaling between adjacent cells (18Himanen J.P. Nikolov D.B. Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 46-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, to date there has been little functional data to validate the Eph/ephrin interaction model proposed in the crystal structure. In addition, the possible contributions of other Eph domains to the active signaling complex have not been addressed. Interestingly, earlier in vivo studies indicate a requirement of direct Eph-Eph interaction via the cysteine-rich motif for Eph function during early development (11Lackmann M. Oates A.C. Dottori M.

Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B. Nature. 2001; 414: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although the underlying ephrin-independent Eph dimerization can trigger trans-phosphorylation in vitro, it is clear that ephrin-dependent and -independent Eph activation result in distinct downstream signaling and biological response pathways (5Lawrenson I.D. Wimmer-Kleikamp S.H. Lock P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Down M. Boyd A.W. Alewood P.F. Lackmann M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1059-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism of ephrin-A5-induced Eph activation in more detail, we generated an expression library of EphA3 ECD point mutants that were selected for proteins of correct conformation with reduced ephrin-A5 binding. We found that some 80% of the 50 identified mutants locate to EphA3 regions predicted by the EphB2/ephrin-B2 structure to form part of the Eph/ephrin dimerization and tetramerization interfaces. Furthermore, kinetic analysis and functional assessment of mutant cell surface-expressed, full-length EphA3 validates the requirement of each of these Eph/ephrin contacts for the formation of high affinity, biologically relevant EphA3-ephrin-A5 complexes. Importantly, a distinct third group of mutants, defining a third Eph/ephrin interface, is positioned outside the crystallographically characterized ligand-binding domain, within the cysteine-rich linker previously implicated in receptor/receptor contacts. Although their kinetics analysis indicates only moderate effects on ephrin binding, a matching point mutation in the linker region of cell surface-expressed EphA3 abrogates ephrin-induced phosphorylation and Crk recruitment, emphasizing the functional importance of this interface. This mutagenesis analysis provides, for the first time, functional evidence for the essential contribution of several distinct Eph/ephrin interfaces for the formation of signaling-competent Eph/ephrin hetero-oligomers. EphA3 and Ephrin-A5 Fc Constructs—A cDNA encompassing bp 103-1692 from full-length human EphA3 (12Wicks I.P. Wilkinson D. Salvaris E. Boyd A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was cloned into pIgBOS for expression of the EphA3 exodomain fused to the human IgG1 hinge and Fc regions (EphA3-Fc), as described (19Coulthard M.G. Lickliter J.D. Subanesan N. Chen K. Webb G.C. Lowry A.J. Koblar S. Bottema C.D. Boyd A.W. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). EphA3-Fc and ephrin-A5 Fc (gift of Dr. D. Cerretti, Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA) were used for stable transfection of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Fc fusion proteins were purified from cell culture supernatants (RPMI 1640, 2.5% immunoglobulin-depleted fetal bovine serum) by protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) affinity chromatography, followed by size-exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography. Yeast EphA3 Expression Construct—A cDNA encoding the EphA3 extracellular domain (Glu21 to Ser539, ECD) was cloned into the yeast expression vector YEpFLAG-1 (Sigma), containing a FLAG epitope and the alcohol dehydrogenase promoter for activation of transcription/translation under low glucose conditions. In addition to a C-terminal myc epitope (EEQKLISEEDL*), EcoRI and BglII cloning sites were introduced between the FLAG and Myc sequences to accommodate insertion of EphA3-ECD cDNAs. Accordingly, the 5′-EphA3 oligonucleotide (21ELIPQPSNE30V (12Wicks I.P. Wilkinson D. Salvaris E. Boyd A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)) was altered to introduce a unique EcoRI site (Leu22, CTG to Phe, TTC) at the junction of FLAG and EphA3 sequences, and a BglII sequence was added to the 3′-oligonucleotide (corresponding to 534SISGES). A unique BamHI site was further created by a silent mutation at nucleotides 997-1002 within the exon IV-encoded EGF-like domain. The EphA3 protein derived from this construct was detectable with either anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) or the anti-Myc antibody (9E10, generous gift from Dr. D. Huang, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research) and bound ephrin-A5 with comparable affinity to the wild-type receptor. Mutants of the EphA3 ECD were created by random mutagenesis using non-stringent PCR (20Jenkins B.J. D'Andrea R. Gonda T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4276-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Conditions were optimized to yield 3-4 mutations or 1-3 amino acid changes per clone, so that 500 independent clones with some 1000 mutated amino acid residues provided a 4-fold mutational coverage of the target sequence (Table I).Table IThe effect of divalent cations on PCR mutations in the EphA3 templatePCR mixMnCl2MgCl2Total bases sequencedMutation ratemmA07.044401:370B0.17.048401:345C0.257.066001:194D0.57.055661:118E01.573801:1476 Open table in a new tab The EcoRI- and BamHI-digested PCR products were ligated into the EphA3-YEpFLAG-1 vector and the resulting mutant plasmid library, encoding EphA3 ECD with mutations in the ligand-binding domain and cysteine-rich linker, and the N-terminal half of the EGF-like domain (Ala272 to Ser301) was amplified in Escherichia coli. Plasmid cDNAs from pooled colonies (∼13,000) were transfected into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BJ3505 containing the plasmid TRP1 gene for selection in tryptophan-deficient media (SD growth medium). Individual colonies were seeded into parallel 96-well trays containing selection medium or normal agar culture medium covered with cellulose nitrate filters. EphA3 protein expression in colonies was induced by transfer of the cellulose filters to zero glucose YPEM medium, and secreted proteins were captured by absorption onto 3-4 replicate nitrocellulose filters for screening. Individual filters from each set of replicates were probed with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against EphA3 (IIIA4), the Myc epitope (9E10), the FLAG epitope (M2), and with ephrinA5-Fc. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako) were used for detection. Colonies showing reduced ephrin-A5 binding were recovered, and DNA was extracted for sequence analysis of the EphA3 (EcoRI-BamHI) inserts. To deconvolute critical EphA3 ECD clones containing more that one amino acid change, individual residues were replicated in the pEF BOS-FLAG-EphA3 mammalian expression vector (11Lackmann M.

The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/silver staining and Western blot using α-EphA3 (polyclonal) or α-FLAG (monoclonal) antibodies. Western blots were developed using ECL detection (SuperSignal Chemiluminescence, Pierce). Purified EphA3 ECD proteins in BIAcore buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Tween 20) were analyzed at 27 °C on parallel IIIA4 and ephrinA5-derivatized CM5 sensor chips (BIAcore 2000 optical biosensor, BIAcore AB, Sweden). The protein concentrations were determined at A215 (21Lackmann M. Bucci T. Mann R.J. Kravets L.A. Viney E. Smith F. Moritz R.L. Carter W. Simpson R.J. Nicola N.A. Mackwell K. Nice E.C. Wilks A.F.

To ascertain the performance of sensor chip-immobilized proteins, samples of purified EphA3 ECD (62.5-1000 ng/ml) were analyzed in each assay. Interaction kinetics was evaluated from eight serial dilutions of each sample by Global Analysis using the BIAevaluation software (version 3.1). Purified ephrinA5-Fc was labeled using an Alexa Fluor™ 546 fluorescent labeling kit (Molecular Probes). Coupling of the ALEXA dye and its effect on the biological integrity of ephrin was monitored during the labeling reaction by spectral (high pressure liquid chromatography diode array detection) and BIAcore analysis, respectively. Labeling reactions were terminated when the first decrease in binding was detected. Ephrin binding in situ to cells transiently transfected with mutant EphA3-GFP receptors was analyzed by 10 min of incubation with 1.5 μg/ml, human IgG pre-clustered Alexa 546 ephrinA5-Fc. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde, and mounted in distyrene/plasticiser/xylene. Confocal fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus FV500 with an oil immersion objective provided the resulting images. A three-dimensional model of the human EphA3 ligand-binding domain complexed to ephrin-A5 was based on the x-ray crystal coordinates of the corresponding mouse EphB2-ephrin-B2 complex (17Himanen J.P.

Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) (Accelrys, San Diego). The models were evaluated for structural quality and compatibility with known protein structures as described (23Smith D.K. Treutlein H.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using the “ProStat” and “Profiles3D” modules of InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego). Library of EphA3 Variants Deficient in EphrinA5 Binding—Our mutagenesis approach targeted an 830-bp EphA3 cDNA fragment spanning the globular ligand binding, the cysteine-rich linker, and the N-terminal part of the EGF-like domain. During optimization we confirmed by sequence analysis of randomly selected bacterial colonies the following: (a) all 4 bases were mutated with similar frequencies; (b) there was no apparent restriction in nucleotide placement; and (c) mutants were randomly distributed across the entire sequence. This strategy yielded 1300 bacterial YEpFLAG-1 colonies and a derived expression library of ∼700 mutant yeast clones. As early results indicated less than 2% of FLAG-negative clones (empty vector or lack of secretion), routine screening for the FLAG epitope was discontinued to preserve samples. The analysis of 677 informative colonies suggests that 50% of the clones produced proteins with apparent defects in ephrin-A5 binding (Table II). To evaluate whether any mutations disrupt the overall protein fold, we used the IIIA4 anti-EphA3 mAb that has been used previously to monitor the EphA3 conformation (21Lackmann M. Bucci T. Mann R.J.

The 14% Myc-negative mutants were excluded from further analyses as they likely represent prematurely terminated translation products. Of the remaining colonies, 334 (57%) retained ephrin-A5 binding, only 26 of which lost immunoreactivity to IIIA4. The majority (79%) of mutants that failed to bind ephrin-A5 also did not bind IIIA4. Only 7% of all mutants lost ephrin-A5 binding capacity while retaining IIIA4 reactivity and were selected for further detailed analysis.Table IICharacteristics of the EphA3 mutant yeast expression libraryMyc epitope presentIIIA4 bindingephrin A5 Fc bindingNo. colonies% colonies++−457+−−20430+−+264+++30845−−−10816* Open table in a new tab Sequence Analysis Reveals Three Distinct Mutant Clusters Depicting EphA3/Ephrin-A5 Interaction Sites—cDNAs from 38 of the 45 EphA3 clones with compromised ephrin-A5 binding were recovered for sequence analysis. Although the selection of mutants focused on clones binding IIIA4 (Table II), some of these were found to exhibit substantially reduced or marginal IIIA4 reactivity in subsequent assays (indicated by *, Table III, see also Table IV). In a single case, a clone initially negative for ephrin-A5 binding revealed w/t binding characteristics in subsequent assays (Glu60 → Asp).

Although 2,6-dichlorohydroxyquinol is a logical metabolic intermediate, the enzyme hardly uses it as a substrate, implying it may not be a true intermediate. Evidence is provided to support the proposition that the monooxygenase oxidized 2,4,6-TCP to 2,6-dichloroquinone that remained with the enzyme and got hydrolyzed to 2-chlorohydroxyquinone, which was chemically reduced by ascorbate and NADH to 6-chlorohydroxyquinol. When the monooxygenase oxidized 2,6-dichlorophenol, the product was 2,6-dichloroquinol, which was not further converted to 6-chlorohydroxyquinol, implying that the enzyme only converts 2,6-dichloroquinone to 6-chlorohydroxyquinol. Stoichiometric analysis indicated the consumption of one O2 molecule per 2,4,6-TCP converted to 6-chlorohydroxyquinol, ruling out the possibility of two oxidative reactions. Experiments with 18O-labeling gave direct evidence for the incorporation of oxygen from both O2 and H2O into the produced 6-chlorohydroxyquinol. A monooxygenase that catalyzes hydroxylation by both oxidative and hydrolytic reactions has not been reported to date. The ability of the enzyme to perform two types of reactions is not due to the presence of a second functional domain but rather is due to catalytic promiscuity, as a homologous monooxygenase converts 2,4,6-TCP to only 2,6-dichloroquinol. Employing both conventional catalysis and catalytic promiscuity of a single enzyme in two consecutive steps of a metabolic pathway has been unknown previously."
https://openalex.org/W2051505537,"Mutations in CDH1, encoding E-cadherin, are the underlying genetic defect in approximately one-third of the hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) families described so far. Tumours arising in these families show abnormal or absence of E-cadherin expression, following the model of tumour suppressor gene inactivation. A single study has been reported showing inactivation of the CDH1 wild-type allele in tumour cells from HDGC families either by promoter methylation or by somatic mutation. In order to find the genetic alteration responsible for the presence of diffuse gastric cancers in four members of a Caucasian family, we have screened the coding sequence of CDH1 for germline mutations and searched for the second inactivating hit in the tumour samples. In this family, we have found a germline splice-site mutation in all members affected by gastric cancer and, in one tumour, a somatic deletion affecting at least exon 8 of CDH1. Our results show that a CDH1 intragenic deletion is the second hit inactivating the wild-type allele, in one of the tumours in this family."

Based on their biophysical properties, VGCCs are subdivided into L-, N-, P/Q-, R-, and T-type channels. VGCCs are protein complexes consisting of a channel-forming, voltage-sensing α1 subunit and α2δ, β, and γ auxiliary subunits (1Hofmann F. Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Here, we provide a phenotypic, molecular, and functional characterization of a novel spontaneous Cacna2d2 mutant, entla (symbol used here: ent). Animals—Animals were maintained in a certified animal facility according to state legal guidelines and provided a commercial diet and water ad libitum. The entla phenotype was first observed in a heterogeneous genetic background (DBA/2J, CD1). Heterozygous animals were subsequently crossed into a C57BL/6J genetic background for 10 generations. For our studies, N2 to N10 animals were used. For tissue preparation, animals were anesthetized under CO2 and decapitated, and the desired tissue was removed, shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C until further use. Nucleic Acid Preparation—DNA from tail tip biopsies was isolated according to standard methods. DNA from spleen or liver was isolated using the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or by standard phenol extraction. Total RNA was isolated using the peqGold RNAPure system (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). cDNA was assembled by reverse transcription of 1-1.5 μg of RNA using random hexamers or nonamers (Invitrogen). Candidate Gene Analysis—The Cacna2d2 coding region was PCR-amplified from cerebellar cDNA in four portions using the following primers (all primer sequences indicated 5′ to 3′): Forward1, CGC CGC ATC TTG AAT GGA AAC; Reverse1, TGC CAC AAC AGT GTA GGG TCT TGC; Forward2, CTG CAG GAC AAC ATC AAG GAG; Reverse2, GTG TCA GGT TGA AAA CAG GGA GAG; Forward3, CCG CTC CAC ACA GGA ATA CC; Reverse3, CAT CCA CCT CAC TGA AGA ATC TGC; Forward4, TG TCA ACC AGA ACC ATC AGT GG; Reverse4, GCG TGT CTG TTT GTG TGT TCC ATC. PCRs were performed using the HiFidelity polymerase system (Roche Applied Science) with annealing temperatures of 58-60 °C. Additionally, the GC-rich 5′ portion of the coding region was amplified using the Triple Master polymerase system for GC-rich targets (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), the forward primer (GCG CCG CAT CTT GAA TGG), reverse primer (CGT GTG CTG CTG GGG GAA G), and an annealing temperature of 64 °C. Amplification of the rearrangement site was performed with spleen DNA using the forward primers in intron 3 before the MfeI site at 6.6 kb (Fw1) (CCA GAT TTC AAG GAG ACA GAC AGT AAC C) or before the MfeI site at 24 kb (Fw2) (CAG GGA CCA ACA AAA CAA GAG TGT AG) with the reverse primer (GCG GGG CAT AAA AGC AGA GAT AGC) Triple Master polymerase system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) for long range PCR and an annealing temperature of 58 °C. All fragments were cloned into the pCR2.1/TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced on an ABI Prism 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Genotyping and Mapping—entla homozygotes were identified at 2 weeks of age by their motor phenotype. Heterozygous and wild type animals were identified through breeding or genotyping using tail tip DNA and primers that amplify the chromosomal rearrangement site (forward primer, CAC ACC CCA GAC CAC ACT TTA TG; reverse primer, CAC TCT CCC ACC CCC ACA TTC). Using brain cDNA, +/+, +/ent, and ent/ent animals were genotyped by amplification of Cacna2d2 from exon 1 to exon 7 using the forward primer (GGA GAT TGA CGG TGT GAT GCG) and the reverse primer (CAA ACA GGT TCC GAT TGT CCT TG). All genotyping PCRs were performed using HiFidelity polymerase mix (Roche Applied Science) and an annealing temperature of 57 °C. For Southern hybridizations, 50-100 μg of DNA were digested overnight with the respective enzymes, separated on 0.3% agarose gels, transferred onto an uncharged nitrocellulose membrane, and cross-linked. Probes were [α-32P]dCTP-labeled using the Prime-It II Random Primer Labeling Kit (Invitrogen). Hybridizations and washes were carried out according to standard procedures. Signals were detected on a PhosphorImager (Storm 960; Amersham Biosciences). Mapping was performed using published primers and protocols (16Dietrich W.F. Miller J. Steen R.

Expression Vectors—entla Cacna2d2-cDNA was PCR-amplified as described above, joined by overlapping extension or ligation in pCR TOPO-TA (Invitrogen), and a KpnI and an XhoI site were introduced in front of the initial ATG codon and the TAA stop codon, respectively. Cacnb4 cDNA was amplified from wild type C57BL/6J animals using the forward primer AGG TAC CAT GTA TGA CAA TTT GTA CCT GC and the reverse primer ACT CGA GTC AAA GCC TAT GTC GGG A, likewise introducing a 5′ KpnI and a 3′ XhoI site. The constructs were cloned into pCDNA3.1V5HisTOPO (Invitrogen). Cacna2d2 wild type and Cacna1A constructs described by Hobom et al. (11Hobom M. Dai S. Marais E. Lacinova L. Hofmann F. Klugbauer N.

Cacna2d2 constructs represent the splice variants lacking exon 23 as well as the first 6 nucleotides of exon 38. Membrane Protein Preparations and Western Blotting—Membrane protein was prepared by repeated homogenization and centrifugation in hypotonic potassium phosphate buffer, and the protein content was determined according to the modified method of Lowry as described previously (17Sontheimer H.

Signals were detected on a Storm 960 fluoroimager (Amersham Biosciences). Immunohistochemistry and Immunocytochemistry—Paraformaldehyde-fixed and cryoprotected brains were frozen to -20 °C and then cut into 14-μm sections on a cryotome. Sections were stored on poly-l-lysine-coated slides (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) at -70 °C. Immunostaining was performed at room temperature. Sections were blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal calbindin antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 h, followed by Cy-3-labeled goat-anti-rabbit antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h (1:200 dilution). Sections were viewed under a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For immunocytochemistry, the antibody was affinity-purified according to Ref. 12Marais E.

After 48-71 h, cells were fixed in 4% PAFA, 4% sucrose for 30 min and (if desired) permeabilized in PBS plus 0.02% Triton X-100 for 8 min, blocked in PBS plus 10% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, incubated with primary antibody (concentrations of 1:100 to 1:500) in PBS plus 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 h, and subsequently incubated with chemifluorescent 5-([4,6-dichlorotriazine-2-yl]amino)fluoresceine (DTAF)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. Cells were mounted onto cover slides in Mowiol and viewed under a confocal laser microscope system (TCS-SL; Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). [3H]Gabapentin Binding Assays—Specific binding of [3H]gabapentin (Amersham Biosciences) to membrane fractions was determined using 10-30-μg samples of membrane protein and 1 μl of [3H]gabapentin dilutions in a filtration assay using GF/C membranes (20Pfeiffer F. Betz H. Brain Res. 1981; 226: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). [3H]gabapentin dilutions were incubated with membrane protein for 1 h at room temperature. Specific binding was determined by subtracting unspecific binding observed in the presence of 10 mm of unlabeled gabapentin from total binding. All samples were prepared in triplicate and subjected to liquid scintillation counting (Amersham Biosciences). Binding data were fitted to the following equation using Origin (Microcal, Northampton, MA), dpmspec = Bmax = [GBP]/([GBP] + KD), where dpmspec represents specific binding expressed as scintillator counts, Bmax is the total number of agonist binding sites, KD is the binding capacity, and [GBP] is the concentration of free [3H]gabapentin. Electroencephalographic Recording—Under general anesthesia (equithesin, 4 ml/kg intraperitoneally), mice (n = 5) were stereotactically implanted with a bipolar electrode inserted into the hippocampus and two monopolar electrodes just touching the cortex. In addition, a monopolar surface electrode was placed over the cerebellum (reference electrode). The bipolar electrode was formed of two twisted enamel-insulated stainless steel wires (diameter, 170 μm; distance between the tips, 0.4 mm) connected to a male connector aimed at the right dorsal hippocampus using the following coordinates (with bregma as reference): anteroposterior = -1.5; mediolateral = -1.8; dorsoventral = -1.9 mm. The monopolar electrodes were made of the same enamel-insulated stainless steel wire (diameter, 250 μm) soldered on a male connector (Wire pro, Farnell, France). They were inserted in the skull so that only the tip (0.5 mm) protruded onto the respective brain tissue. The electrodes were fixed to the skull with cyanoacrylate and dental acrylic cement. The mice were then allowed to recover from anesthesia before being placed in the EEG recording chamber. EEG activities of freely moving animals placed in a Faraday cage were recorded using a digital acquisition computer-based system (MP100WSW system; Biopac Systems Inc., Santa Barbara, CA; six channels, sampling rate of 200 Hz). Before starting the EEG recordings, a period of 1 h was allowed for the habituation of the animals to the test cage. Each animal was recorded for a total of 5 h during the resting phase of the animals (2 p.m. to 6 p.m.). Blocks of 1 h were analyzed with respect to seizure type, frequency, and duration. Electrophysiological Recordings—Purkinje cells from P4-P8 animals were acutely dissociated, and Ba2+ currents were measured using modified protocols from (21Mintz I.M. Adams M.E. Bean B.P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 85-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Briefly, the vermis region of the cerebellum was transferred into ice-cold dissociation solution (81.4 mm Na2SO4, 30 mm K2SO4, 5.8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm HEPES, 20.4 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and incubated while being oxygenated for 6-8 min at 37 °C in the same solution containing 3 mg/ml protease type XXIII (Sigma). After three washes in dissociation solution and one wash in trituration solution (modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), cells were dissociated by triturating 20-30 times using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The cell suspension was transferred onto silanized polylysine-coated cover slips and kept on ice in trituration solution. Voltage clamp recordings were performed using an extracellular solution containing 85 mm NaCl, 20 mm triethanolamine-Cl, 10 mm BaCl2, 5 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, and in intracellular solution containing 120 mm CaCl2, 20 mm triethanolamine-Cl, 11 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (11Hobom M. Dai S. Marais E. Lacinova L. Hofmann F. Klugbauer N. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Sodium currents were blocked by adding 300 nm tetrodotoxin to the extracellular solution. Whole cell voltage clamp recordings were carried out from a holding potential of -60 mV according to the following voltage step protocol: 30-ms steps from -60 mV to +30 mV in 10-mV increments with a 10-s interval between voltage steps. Recordings were made at a temperature of 22 °C using an EPC9 amplifier and the PULSE and PULSE-FIT software package (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Statistical Analyses—Limits of significance were determined using one-way analysis of variance. Errors indicate one S.D. value unless otherwise stated. Phenotypic Characterization—The entla phenotype was originally observed in a heterogeneous DBA/2J/CD1 stock and follows an autosomal recessive Mendelian mode of inheritance. The mutation was crossed into a C57BL/6J genetic background for 10 generations, and no alteration of the phenotype was observed. In homozygous mutants, ataxic gait became apparent between postnatal days 13 and 15 and persisted throughout life. During motion, animals exhibited a characteristic outward pointing of the hind limbs (Fig. 1C). Overall posture of the animals was altered as well, either with a “hunchback” (Fig. 1C) or an arched back. About 2 days after the onset of ataxia, ent/ent animals started to experience multiple episodes of paroxysmal dyskinesia per day (Fig. 1, A and B), which lasted up to several minutes and were exacerbated by stress due to handling or noise. ent/ent animals were unable to remain on a rotarod but were able to swim even during episodes of paroxysmal dyskinesia. Homozygous animals were smaller than their littermates from postnatal day 10 on (Fig. 1, D and E). Lethality before weaning in homozygous animals was greater than 50%, but survivors had a normal lifespan (Fig. 1F). Whereas males were fertile albeit with a low breeding performance, homozygous females did not breed and displayed severely dysmorphic uteri with a drastically reduced diameter (Fig. 1G). Genetic Mapping—While crossing the animals into the C57BL/6J background, we found the entla phenotype to be linked to gray coat color caused by the dilute allele of Myosin5a (22Mercer J.A. Seperack P.K. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). DBA/2J mice, a contributing background in which the mutation was first observed, carry the dilute allele. Thus, this suggested a location on chromosome 9 near the Myosin5a locus. Genomic DNA samples from one N2 and 51 N5-N7 intercross entla mice were genotyped for microsatellite markers discriminating between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J at 50-60.1 centimorgans from the centromere on chromosome 9 (Fig. 2A). The mutation was mapped to the 1.87-megabase pair region between the markers D9Mit78 and D9Mit184 at 60.1 centimorgans with the VGCC subunit gene Cacna2d2 emerging as a likely candidate (Fig. 2B). Sequence Analysis of entla Cacna2d2 Transcript and Gene—Sequencing of the Cacna2d2 coding region cDNA revealed an exact duplication of 117 base pairs corresponding to exon 3. Using PCR primers covering the region encoded by exons 1-7, we obtained an amplification product of 598 bp from whole brain cDNA of wild type animals. Using the same primers, a 715-bp product was amplified from cDNA from ent/ent animals, corresponding to the wild type sequence plus the 117-bp duplication. Amplification of cDNA from heterozygous animals yielded both products (Fig. 2C). No apparent differences in expression level or any alternatively spliced products could be detected (data not shown). These observations characterize the entla gene as an allelic variant of Cacna2d2, implying that entla is allelic to ducky and ducky2J. Based on the sequence duplication observed at the transcript level, it seemed plausible that the entla allele represented a genomic duplication encompassing exon 3 of the Cacna2d2 gene. Indeed, Southern hybridization analysis using a hybridization probe corresponding to the genomic region around exon 3 (probe B; Fig. 3C, nucleotide positions -322 to +1383 relative to exon 3) revealed a 17-kb band in addition to the wild type 22-kb band in MfeI-digested +/ent and ent/ent DNA (Fig. 3, A and D). In contrast, we saw no difference in banding pattern in +/+, +/ent, and ent/ent MfeI-restricted DNA when using probes corresponding to the regions surrounding exon 2 (probe A, positions -1451 to +258 bp relative to exon 2), exon 4 (probe D, positions -944 to +920 bp relative to exon 4), or an intron 3 fragment (probe C, 1104 bp between the MfeI sites at positions 6.6 and 24 kb; data not shown). Likewise, no differences were observed using the probe B (exon 3) on EcoRI-digested DNA (data not shown). We thus concluded that the recombination locus in intron 2 resides between the MfeI site at 20 kb and the EcoRI site at 29.2 kb. Two possible recombination loci were left in intron 3: between the EcoRI site at 4.7 kb and the MfeI site at 6.6 kb or between the MfeI sites at 24 and 27.5 kb (Fig. 3C). Long range PCR using genomic DNA from ent/ent and +/+ animals with forward primers either upstream of the MfeI sites at 6.6 kb (Fw1) or at 24 kb (Fw2) in intron 3 and a reverse primer downstream of the EcoRI site at 29 kb in intron 2 should therefore only yield amplification products in mutant DNA (Fig. 3, C and D). Indeed, we were able to amplify products of 21 kb using the Fw1 primer and of 4.6 kb using the Fw2 primer from ent/ent DNA but not from +/+ DNA (Fig. 3B). Sequencing of the 4.6-kb amplification product revealed that it consisted of contiguous parts of intron 3 and intron 2 joined with a 3-base pair overlap (Fig. 3E). The breakpoints corresponded to positions at 27 kb in intron 2 (-12 kb relative to exon 3) and 26 kb in intron 3. A 38-kb genomic duplication between these breakpoints would thus have created a hybrid 3/2 intron consisting of the first 26 kb of intron 3 followed by the last 12 kb of intron 2 between two copies of exon 3 (Fig. 3D). Nonhomologous recombinations are often mediated by stretches of sequence homology (e.g. repetitive elements) (23Lupski J.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 417-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The regions in intron 2 and intron 3 immediately surrounding the recombination sites contained no apparent sequence similarities; however, sequence alignments of intron 2 and 3 revealed several short stretches of sequence homology, which were identified as partial B1 and B2 elements (Fig. 3F). The α2δ-2 Subunit Is Altered in ent/ent Mice—The mutation was predicted to leave the translational frame unaffected and cause a duplication of 39 amino acid residues. Western blot analysis of membrane proteins separated under reducing conditions, using antibodies against an N-terminal epitope of α2, verified that mutant protein was expressed and incorporated into the plasma membrane at levels similar to wild type. The apparent molecular masses of 138 kDa for wild type and ∼150 kDa for entla protein indicated that the α2δ-2entla subunit undergoes correct post-translational cleavage into α2entla and δ proteins. As expected, α2entla possessed a slightly higher molecular mass (Fig. 4A, left panel), yet the observed 10-12-kDa increase in molecular mass exceeded the 5 kDa calculated for the duplicated 39 amino acid residues. The additional increase of 5-7 kDa is likely to be due to glycosylation. The α2 protein is heavily glycosylated (12Marais E. Klugbauer N. Hofmann F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), with the 39 amino acid residues encoded by exon 3 containing several putative N-glycosylation sites. When membrane fractions containing wild type α2δ subunits are separated under nonreducing conditions, the disulfide bonds linking α2 and δ remain unaffected, resulting in a shift to higher apparent molecular weight (12Marais E. Klugbauer N. Hofmann F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Indeed, this was seen for wild type α2δ-2 (Fig. 4A, right panel). However, separation of entla membrane fractions under nonreducing conditions did not result in a corresponding shift. Instead, a band of the same apparent molecular weight as the α2entla protein detected under reducing conditions was observed (Fig. 4A, right panel). It was therefore concluded that the α2entla protein is not covalently linked to the δ protein via disulfide bonds. Recombinant expression of Cacna2d2entla cDNA in HEK293 cells showed that, when co-expressed with the α1A (CaV2.1) and β4 subunits as in typical P-type calcium channels, α2δ-2entla immunoreactivity was localized in the plasma membrane (Fig. 4, E and J). Furthermore, the antibody recognized an epitope in nonpermeabilized cells (i.e. on the extracellular side) (Fig. 4J). Thus, localization and orientation of the entla subunit were indistinguishable from wild type (Fig. 4, C and H). Conversely, when α2δ-2entla was expressed without other calcium channel subunits, immunoreactivity was localized more diffusely throughout the cell (Fig. 4D) with little staining in the plasma membrane (Fig. 4I), indicating that association with other calcium channel subunits causes α2δ-2entla to efficiently move to the plasma membrane. Overall central nervous system anatomy of entla homozygotes appeared normal. In marked contrast to ducky animals (14Meier H. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1968; 11: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Brodbeck J. Davies A. Courtney J.M. Meir A. Balaguero N. Canti C. Moss F.J. Page K.M. Pratt W.S. Hunt S.P. Barclay J. Rees M.

https://openalex.org/W2012612470,"Many cancers have constitutively activated NFκB, the elevation of which contributes to cancer cell resistance to chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis. Although mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-regulated kinase kinase kinase-3 (MEKK3) has been shown to participate in the activation of NFκB, its relations to apoptosis and cancer are unclear. In this study, we established cell model systems to examine whether stable expression of MEKK3 could lead to increased NFκB activity and confer resistance to apoptosis. In addition, we investigated in breast and ovarian cancers whether MEKK3 expression may be altered and correlated with aberrant NFκB activity. We show that stable cell lines overexpressing MEKK3 not only had elevated levels of NFκB binding activity but also were more responsive to cytokine stimulation. These stable cells showed 2–4-fold higher basal expression of Bcl-2 and xIAP than the parental cells. Consistent with this increased expression of cell survival genes, MEKK3 stable cells showed reduced activation of caspases 3 and 8 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and dramatically increased resistance to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, camptothecin, and paclitaxel. Intriguingly, analysis of human breast and ovarian cancers showed that a significant fraction of these samples have elevated MEKK3 protein levels with corresponding increases in NFκB binding activities. Thus, our results established that elevated expression of MEKK3 appears to be a frequent occurrence in breast and ovarian cancers and that overexpression of MEKK3 in cells leads to increased NFκB activity and increased expression of cell survival factors and ultimately contributes to their resistance to apoptosis. As such, MEKK3 may serve as a therapeutic target to control cancer cell resistance to cytokine- or drug-induced apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W2044680650,"Loss of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) results in increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation due to inefficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Overexpression of DNA-PK in tumor cells conversely results in resistance to ionizing radiation. It is therefore possible that inhibition of DNA-PK will enhance the preferential killing of tumor cells by radiotherapy. Available inhibitors of DNA-PK, like wortmannin, are cytotoxic and stop the cell cycle because they inhibit phoshatidylinositol-3-kinases at 100-fold lower concentrations required to inhibit DNA-PK. In an effort to develop a specific DNA-PK inhibitor, we have characterized SU11752, from a three-substituted indolin-2-ones library. SU11752 and wortmannin were equally potent inhibitors of DNA-PK. In contrast, inhibition of the phoshatidylinositol-3-kinase p110gamma required 500-fold higher concentration of SU11752. Thus, SU11752 was a more selective inhibitor of DNA-PK than wortmannin. Inhibition kinetics and a direct assay for ATP binding showed that SU11752 inhibited DNA-PK by competing with ATP. SU11752 inhibited DNA double-strand break repair in cells and gave rise to a five-fold sensitization to ionizing radiation. At concentrations of SU11752 that inhibited DNA repair, cell cycle progression was still normal and ATM kinase activity was not inhibited. We conclude that SU11752 defines a new class of drugs that may serve as a starting point for the development of specific DNA-PK inhibitors."

Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 is a purple nonsulfur photosynthetic bacterium that can grow aerobically, anaerobically in the light, or anaerobically in the dark in the presence of external electron acceptors such as dimethyl sulfoxide. When grown anaerobically in the light or dark, R. sphaeroides synthesizes an intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM) 1The abbreviations used are: ICM, intracytoplasmic membrane; Rubisco, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; ORF, open reading frame; W, watt(s); PS, photosynthesis; EF-G, elongation factor G; CSP, cold shock protein. system, which constitutes the photosynthetic apparatus and possesses the structural components necessary for light energy capture, subsequent electron transport, and energy transduction (1Kiley P.J. Kaplan S. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 50-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The composition and assembly of the ICM are known to be tightly regulated, with light intensity and oxygen tension being among the most prominent environmental stimuli that serve to control the synthesis and function of the ICM (2Zeilstra-Ryalls J.

Light intensity has a somewhat more subtle effect on photosynthetically growing cells, whereby the cellular levels of ICM are inversely related to light intensity and the composition of the ICM is differentially altered with changing light intensity (1Kiley P.J.

What has been obvious from all of these studies is that they have been by necessity incremental, i.e. one gene at a time. With the advent of the DNA sequence, assembly and annotation of the R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 genome (21Mackenzie C. Choudhary M. Larimer F.W. Predki P.F. Stilwagen S. Armitage J.P. Barber R.D.

Finally, we are in the position of being able to follow the expression of well studied regulatory elements controlling the photosynthesis lifestyle, as these respond to oxygen- and light-induced regulation. For the first time, we are able to observe the expression of many genes for which encoded proteins are responsible for the flow of redox in R. sphaeroides, with the goal being to model these complex interacting pathways. In the present work we have extended our studies of oxygen control of gene expression as well as the role of high (100 W/m2) versus low (3 W/m2) light intensity on gene expression in R. sphaeroides 2.4.1. We directly address the hypothesis that oxygen and light regulation of gene expression in R. sphaeroides extend well beyond those systems, giving rise to the photosynthetic lifestyle. R. sphaeroides Growth Conditions—R. sphaeroides strains were grown at 30 ± 0.5 °C on Sistrom’s minimal medium A containing succinate as a carbon source. Aerobic cultures were grown sparging with a gas mixture of 30% O2, 69% N2, and 1% CO2 and harvested at an A600 nm of 0.2 ± 0.02 to ensure oxygen saturation. Photosynthetic cultures were grown at a light intensity of either 3 or 100 W/m2 measured at the surface of the growth vessel and sparging with 95% N2, 5% CO2 and harvested at A600 nm of 0.45 ± 0.05, which insures that self-shading is not problem. Light intensity was measured using an YSI-Kettering model 65A radiometer (Simpson Electric Co.). DNA Manipulation—To prepare hybridization probes for Northern blot analysis, genes encoding the translation elongation factor G (RSP2248) and two encoding cold shock proteins (RSP2346 and RSP3621) were PCR-amplified using chromosomal DNA of R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 as template. RSP2248 was amplified with primers 5′-GAT CCT GCG CTT TCT CGA CGA CCG CAA-3′ and 5′-GAA GCT CGG CCA TCA GCG CAT CGT CGA-3′. RSP2346 and 3621 were amplified with primers 5′-GTG GAA GAC GAA AAG GCC CTG CAG CTT-3′ and 5′-GGC CGG TTG CTG ATG CTG ACG CGC TGC-3′, and with primers 5′-ACA GGA GAG ATC ACG ATG GCC AAT GGC ACC GTG-3′ and 5′-GGC GAG AAC GAG GTT CGT CGC CGA CTC GCG GC-3′, respectively. PCR-amplified DNA fragments were subcloned in pGEM-T easy vector (Promega), and the DNA sequence was confirmed. Each subclone was digested with NotI, and the DNA fragments containing the PCR-amplified DNA were isolated following agarose gel electrophoresis, and labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the RadPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). Hybridization and washing was performed with QuikHyb hybridization solution following the instructions from the manufacturer (Stratagene). Quantitation of specific signals from the Northern blot analyses was performed by subtracting background for each lane from the values for the specific band using the spot density tools of the AlphaEaseTC™ imaging system (Alpha Innotech). RNA Manipulation—A previously described RNA isolation procedure (26Roh J.H. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5330-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was modified to optimize the isolation of intact mRNA for DNA microarray analysis. We modified the earlier procedure by eliminating cell collection by centrifugation. A volume of cells grown as described was directly pipetted into an equal volume of 2 × lysis buffer (100 °C). After thorough mixing, lysed cells were immediately transferred to an equal volume of hot phenol solution (65 °C). Total time required to transfer from the culture vessel to hot phenol was kept to less than 1 min to minimize mRNA degradation and to maximize the yield of intact mRNA. The remainder of the RNA purification procedure was identical to that described previously (26Roh J.H. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5330-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Each isolated RNA sample was treated with 50 μl of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (1 unit/μl, Promega) and 50 μl of 10× buffer in a total volume of 500 μl. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C; extracted with acidic phenol, acidic phenol/chloroform, and chloroform; and then precipitated by adding 1 ml of ethanol. The pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and suspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. Total RNA was pelleted again by adding the same volume of 4 m LiCl, washed with 75% ethanol, and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. Chromosomal DNA contamination was tested by PCR amplification using the rdxB-specific primers (a and b) as described previously (26Roh J.H. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5330-5338Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Microarray Experiment and Data Analysis—The R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 GeneChip was custom-designed and manufactured by Affymetrix Inc. 2R. sphaeroides 2.4.1, which was used for genomic sequencing and construction of the GeneChip, is available through the ATCC as strain number BAA-808. The manuscript describing construction of the Affymetrix GeneChip will be published elsewhere. The GeneChip contains information for 4292 ORFs, 47 rRNA and tRNAs, 65 selected ORFs from R. sphaeroides strains other than R. sphaeroides 2.4.1, and 394 intergenic regions. Intergenic regions are designated for DNA regions larger than 0.5 kb situated between ORFs. Almost 75% of these are shown to be actual ORFs. Total RNA was prepared from three independent cultures involving R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 grown under aerobic or photosynthetic conditions. cDNA synthesis, fragmentation, labeling, and hybridization were adapted, with few modifications, from the methods optimized for the GeneChip designed for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Genome Array by Affymetrix Inc (www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manuals.affx). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA was annealed with 750 ng of random primers (New England Biolabs) and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, and then at 25 °C for 1 h. First strand cDNA was synthesized with 200 units/μl SuperScript II with 5× first strand buffer (Invitrogen) in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 0.5 units/μl SUPERase·In (Ambion) RNase inhibitor (25 °C for 20 min, 37 °C for 1 h, 42 °C for 1 h, 70 °C for 10 min). After removal of RNA by alkaline treatment and neutralization, the cDNA synthesis product was purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). For fragmentation, 7–9 μg of cDNA and 1 unit of RQ1 DNase I (Promega) were incubated at 37 °C. One third of the cDNA from the cDNA-DNase mixture was heat inactivated for every 1 min after adding the RQI DNase. The desired cDNA size range of 50–200 bases was selected after 3% agarose gel electrophoresis using 200 ng of fragmented cDNA. The fragmented cDNA was 3′ end-labeled using the Enzo BioArray Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix) with biotin-ddUTP. Target hybridization, washing, staining, and scanning were performed according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer using a GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640, a Fluidics Station 400, and the Agilent GeneArray Scanner under the control of the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0. Computer Programs—The scanned image was analyzed using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 to obtain signal value, detection calls (present/absent/marginal), and p values. The relative -fold change and hierarchical clustering of the hybridization intensity of the experimental probe set to that of the control were calculated using dChip 1.2 software (biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/dchip1) (27Li C. Hung Wong W. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-11Google Scholar, 28Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar). For group comparisons, filtering criterion between the group means was a 1.5-fold change using the 90% confidence boundary for 0-fold change, which is calculated using the standard error of the group means (27Li C. Hung Wong W. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-11Google Scholar, 28Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar). The Pearson correlation coefficient value (r value) was calculated using the Microsoft Excel program. Overview of Microarray Analysis—The transcriptome profiles from three independent cultures grown and processed independently under high and low light intensities, as well as under aerobic conditions, were analyzed. The present/absent/marginal percentage and the reliability between triplicate samples are summarized in Table I. “Present” calls by MAS5 for both 100 W/m2 and aerobic growth conditions were approximately the same percentage values; these calls were considerably greater than those observed for cells grown at 3 W/m2. Conversely, the percentage “absent” was greater at 3 W/m2 than observed for aerobic or high light grown cells. “Marginal” calls were approximately the same regardless of growth condition. The experimental reproducibility between samples of the same data set is indicated by the r value (Table I). There are two different forms of control genes on the R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 GeneChip in addition to genes from other organisms, namely 24 probe sets from non-related organisms such as E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and bacteriophage P1, as well as nine ORF from R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 which are represented by five copies each. The 24 control probe sets from the different organisms were all detected as “absent,” and the standard deviation for the five copies each of nine ORF from R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 did not exceed 25% of the average value for the set. The mean intensity levels for each probe set were cross-compared using dChip 1.2 software, and the -fold change between the group means was calculated using the standard deviation of the group means (27Li C. Hung Wong W. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-11Google Scholar, 28Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar). Those genes/ORFs that showed a greater than 1.5-fold change with 90% confidence boundaries were used for further analysis.Table ISummary of DNA microarray analyses Present/absent/marginal calls were obtained using the MAS5 (Affymetrix Inc.), and indicated by lowest and highest percentage for triplicate samples. Gap genes (generally incomplete genes at the ends of contigs) represent ≈5% of total genome prior to final assembly and represent ≈1.3% after assembly. All gap genes are located at their correct position on the assembled genome. r value is the Pearson correlation coefficient and obtained by comparison of the 5306 probe sets to one another within the triplicate set.CulturePresentAbsentMarginalr value%%%3 W/m2ORF58–6432–393–40.978, 0.984GAP31–3858–654–50.986100 W/m2ORF68–7225–293–40.988, 0.994GAP39–4451–564–50.994AerobicORF65–7125–313–40.980, 0.988GAP34–4154–615–60.991 Open table in a new tab In Fig. 1, we have depicted the numbers of genes/ORFs that either increased or decreased relative to one of the other culture conditions, with all combinations being provided. Several points are noteworthy. There is the greatest degree of variability in gene expression when the 3 W/m2 condition is viewed relative to aerobic growth as opposed to when high light (100 W/m2) is similarly compared with aerobic growth. In the former comparison, there were 543 up-regulated and 911 down-regulated genes. This observation is consistent with earlier, although much more limited observations that high light grown photosynthetic cells are more similar to aerobic grown cells, as least with regard to the percentage of genes up- or down-regulated, but not necessarily involving the same genes when the comparison is made to low light grown photosynthetic cells (29Tai S.P. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 181-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chory J. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 465-474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kaplan S. Arntzen C.J. Photosynthetic Energy Conversion by Plants and Bacteria. Academic Press, Orlando1982: 67-151Google Scholar). Low light grown cells show an approximate 60–70% slower growth rate compared with high light grown cells (1Kiley P.J. Kaplan S. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 50-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, such cells contain 3–4-fold higher levels of photosynthetic membrane, as well as a greater differential increase in the B800–850 spectral complex relative to the B875 spectral complex, and a volume nearly 70% greater than high light grown cells (1Kiley P.J. Kaplan S. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 50-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tai S.P. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 181-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the data reveal that the median range in increased -fold change in gene/ORF expression is in the 3–5 range for aerobic versus 3 W/m2 or 100 W/m2, declining to the 2–3-fold range for 3 W/m2 versus 100 W/m2. Similarly, when one looks at those genes/ORFs showing a decline in expression, the median values decrease from -2 to -3 range to -3 to -5 range as one goes from aerobic versus 3 W/m2 to 3 W/m2 versus 100 W/m2. A comparison between the two photosynthetically grown data sets shows 636 genes/ORFs up-regulated and 427 down-regulated. Because there are between 1200–1500 genes/ORFs showing changes under these conditions, it implies that most of the genes/ORFs affected by oxygen and light intensity have never been observed. If we are overly generous in compiling those genes known to be part of the photosynthetic lifestyle, we come up with ∼150–175. A detailed list of genes/ORFs that comprise the data described in Fig. 1 can be found at our web site (www.rhodobacter.org) and has been included here as supplementary data, available in the on-line version of this article. As described above there are many published studies that have followed, individually, the expression of a few, but not most of the genes encoding the photosystem in R. sphaeroides (32Lee J.K.

However, these studies have been by necessity selective, and for the most part the overwhelming majority of these genetic elements comprising the photosynthetic lifestyle have never been investigated under the diverse environmental conditions described here. Photosynthesis Gene Cluster—As previously described for those genes encoding the apoproteins of the spectral complexes (19Oh J.I. Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3081-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Lee J.K. DeHoff B.S. Donohue T.J. Gumport R.I. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19354-19365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lee J.K. Kiley P.J. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3391-3405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is a wealth of expression data, but for the most part the majority of the genes of the PS gene cluster of R. sphaeroides 2.4.1 have never been studied, except to note that their expression is higher under photosynthetic growth conditions relative to aerobic growth. In Fig. 2, in the left panel we show the expression profiles for those genes encoding the apoproteins of the reaction center (RC, puhA, pufL, M), the B875 complex (pufBA), and the B800–850 complex (pucBA) in the presence of oxygen and high and low light intensity under anaerobic growth. Although these data are a repeat of many earlier studies, they serve a very useful and unique purpose, namely helping to validate the use of the GeneChip. When comparisons are made between gene expression profiles for cells grown at 3 W/m2versus 100 W/m2, we also observe, for those genes encoding the apoproteins of the spectral complexes, that these are expressed to much greater levels at low relative to high light. Note that cells grown aerobically constitute our base line for this analysis. Although there are a few genes encoding enzymes in the pigment biosynthetic pathways, which are expressed at moderately high levels and therefore appear on the left panel of Fig. 2, most of the genes in this category are represented in the right panel where expression levels are greatly decreased. The data reveal that for almost all of the pigment encoding genes, even those appearing in the left panel, their expression levels decline at 3 W/m2 relative to 100 W/m2. The consistency of this observation, when coupled to the fact that there are higher cellular pigment levels at low light by a factor of ∼3 (1Kiley P.J. Kaplan S. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 50-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is unexpected and appears paradoxical. However, we suggest that these data may be explained by concluding that post-transcriptional controls, at the level of enzyme activity, may play a more prominent role in pigment production than previously suggested (51Zhu Y.S. Cook D.N. Leach F. Armstrong G.A. Alberti M. Hearst J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1180-1188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Zhu Y.S. Hearst J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7613-7617Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Such a conclusion is also supported by some earlier studies in R. sphaeroides on PucC (25Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2052-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 53Zeng X. Choudhary M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6171-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), CrtA (54O'Gara J.P. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1951-1961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and TspO (55Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5657-5667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Throughout these investigations, we caution that we are cognizant that posttranscriptional analyses, such as an analysis of the proteome, corresponding to most of these genes is lacking. However, many of the pigment-encoding genes that appear to reside in the same transcription unit show similar levels of expression and behavior. Nonetheless, there are a few genes that defy this general trend, e.g. bchM, bchP, crtE, crtA, etc. Evidence exists that for certain of these genes there are additional regulatory factors (19Oh J.I. Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3081-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 56Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21167-21175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The CrtA protein, which has been observed to be highly expressed, is under redox control (56Yeliseev A.A. Kaplan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21167-21175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); the bchE gene is regulated by FnrL (19Oh J.I. Eraso J.M. Kaplan S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3081-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which itself is under post-transcriptional regulation; and for the tspO gene (56Yeliseev A.A."

FAK signaling is regulated by the interactions of transmembrane receptors, integrins, with their extracellular matrix ligands (2Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

Integrin signaling via FAK controls several critical biological processes including cell spreading, cell migration, and cell survival. In addition to its role in the control of these functions in normal cells, FAK may also function in the pathology of human disease, e.g. cancer (5Cance W.G. Liu E.T. Breast Cancer Res.

FAK is overexpressed in a number of tumors, including cancers of the breast and prostate. Furthermore, experimental overexpression of FAK can promote some phenotypes of cancer cells, including growth in soft agar and invasion (11Schneider G.B. Kurago Z. Zaharias R. Gruman L.M.

These investigations demonstrate that FAK is fundamentally important in normal development and that aberrant FAK signaling may contribute to carcinogenesis.FAK discretely co-localizes with integrins at focal adhesions, sites of close contact with the extracellular matrix (2Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 3Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The sequences within FAK responsible for localization have been mapped to ∼140 residues near the C terminus, a region defined as the focal adhesion targeting (FAT) sequence or domain (19Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 20Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Two focal adhesion-associated proteins interact with FAK via the FAT domain, paxillin and talin (19Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 21Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.L. J. Biol.

The precise mechanism of focal adhesion targeting has not been elucidated. Evidence both for and against paxillin and talin as the sole mediators of FAK localization has been presented in the literature (19Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 21Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.L. J. Biol.

This discrepancy may be resolved by postulating multiple mechanisms for localization, i.e. a paxillin-dependent and a talin-dependent mechanism. Proper subcellular localization of FAK is essential for integrin-dependent regulation and for transmission of downstream signals (24Cooley M.A. Broome J.M. Ohngemach C. Romer L.H. Schaller M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3247-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Shen Y. Schaller M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2507-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C-terminal domain of FAK has been used as a potent dominant negative mutant to inhibit signaling via endogenous FAK (27Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Thus, this region of FAK is important for biochemical and biological signaling and is potentially a target for therapeutic intervention.Paxillin is also an essential protein as the paxillin-/- mice are embryonically lethal (28Hagel M. George E.L. Kim A. Tamimi R. Opitz S.L. Turner C.E. Imamoto A. Thomas S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 901-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Paxillin has been implicated in controlling a subset of the biological processes under the control of FAK, including cell spreading and cell migration (28Hagel M. George E.L. Kim A. Tamimi R. Opitz S.L. Turner C.E. Imamoto A. Thomas S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 901-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 29Wade R. Bohl J. Vande Pol S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In several different scenarios, paxillin has been implicated in the control of motility. The α4β1 integrin promotes cell motility, and paxillin was identified as a direct binding partner of the cytoplasmic tail of the α4 subunit (30Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A mutant of α4 that is defective for paxillin binding fails to promote cell motility. This interaction is also required for α4β1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and Pyk2, and these two tyrosine kinases were implicated in regulating motility downstream of α4β1 (30Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 31Rose D.M. Liu S. Woodside D.G. Han J. Schlaepfer D.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5912-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin may play a role in regulating cell motility. A mutant of paxillin completely defective for tyrosine phosphorylation functions as a dominant negative mutant and in one system promotes motility, whereas in a second system it inhibits motility (32Yano H. Uchida H. Iwasaki T. Mukai M. Akedo H. Nakamura K. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9076-9081Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 33Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Valles A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Although the discrepancy between these studies remains to be completely resolved, the evidence supports a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of motility by paxillin. FAK and Pyk2 can regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, directly or indirectly. Furthermore, the association of FAK with paxillin may be a mechanism to promote maximal phosphorylation of paxillin (34Thomas J.W. Cooley M.A. Broome J.M. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Lombardo C.R. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36684-36692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate the important interplay between FAK/Pyk2 and paxillin that appears to control tyrosine phosphorylation and the regulation of cell motility.Paxillin is an adaptor protein with docking sites for a variety of binding partners (35Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of paxillin contains four LIM domains, which are domains that function in mediating protein-protein interactions. The third LIM domain is vital for paxillin function as it contains the major focal adhesion localization determinant within the molecule (36Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The binding partner promoting localization has not been identified. The N-terminal half of paxillin contains sites of tyrosine phosphorylation and five copies of a leucine-rich peptide motif called the LD motif, with a consensus sequence LDXLLXXL (35Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 37Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Turner C.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This peptide sequence also functions in mediating protein-protein interactions. Many paxillin-binding partners associate via these LD motifs including FAK, vinculin, PKL, actopaxin, ILK, and the E6 oncoprotein of papillomavirus (35Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 37Tumbarello D.A. Brown M.C. Turner C.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The binding of FAK to paxillin is mediated by two LD motifs, called LD2 and LD4 (36Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Although LD motif-mediated interactions appear important for the function of paxillin, neither the molecular and structural basis for these interactions nor the binding specificity have been elucidated.Recent structural analysis of the FAT domain of FAK has demonstrated that this domain forms an anti-parallel four-helix bundle (38Arold S.T. Hoellerer M.K. Noble M.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 319-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 39Hayashi I. Vuori K. Liddington R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 40Liu G. Guibao C.D. Zheng J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2751-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Two hydrophobic patches on opposite faces of the FAT domain were initially proposed as docking sites for LD motifs of paxillin (39Hayashi I. Vuori K. Liddington R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic patch 1 (HP1) was at the interface of helix 2 and 3, and HP2 was at the interface of helix 1 and 4. In this model, the LD motifs were assumed to be α-helical in nature, and two LD motifs were proposed to bind to the FAT domain, one to each hydrophobic patch (39Hayashi I. Vuori K. Liddington R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In contrast, Arold et al. (38Arold S.T. Hoellerer M.K. Noble M.E. Structure. 2002; 10: 319-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) proposed a single paxillin-binding site at the interface between helix 2 and 3 (HP1) based upon their crystal structure along with some previously reported mutagenesis data. A subsequent solution structure of FAT in complex with an LD motif peptide fundamentally contradicted the original model (40Liu G. Guibao C.D. Zheng J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2751-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The LD2-docking site on FAT was identified using a paramagnetically labeled peptide, as no interactions could be detected between the peptide and the FAT domain by NOE-based approaches. Although evidence that the LD motif peptide was α-helical in solution was presented, other aspects of the interaction were different. Their results indicated that the FAT domain contains a single LD motif-binding site at HP2 (40Liu G. Guibao C.D. Zheng J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2751-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the peptide docked in the opposite orientation relative to the model of Hayashi et al. (39Hayashi I. Vuori K. Liddington R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), which was based on the crystal structure of the FAT domain. Although these studies have provided important insight into the structure of the FAT domain, there are a number of unresolved issues, including the details of the interaction with paxillin.Here we report the solution structure of the avian FAT domain in complex with a paxillin LD2 peptide solved by NMR spectroscopy. Our study demonstrates that two sites containing either HP1 or HP2, which are on the opposite faces of the FAT domain, function as paxillin LD motif-binding sites with similar binding affinities, yet the thermodynamic basis for binding to the two sites is fundamentally different. Our experimentally derived models of FAT domain-LD2 complexes provide important insight into the structural basis of paxillin recognition.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of the FAT of FAK and Peptide Synthesis—The FAT sequence, containing residues 920-1053 of the avian FAK plus a 12-amino acid N-terminal linker, was expressed and purified as previously described (34Thomas J.W. Cooley M.A. Broome J.M. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Lombardo C.R. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36684-36692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). 2K. C. Prutzman, G. Gao, M. L. King, V. V. Iyer, G. A. Mueller, M. D. Schaller, and S. L. Campbell, submitted for publication. A 27-amino acid residue LD2 peptide (133MTSTSLGSNLSELDRLLLELNAVQHNP159) was chemically synthesized at the University of North Carolina microprotein sequencing and peptide synthesis facility. A [15N]leucine-labeled LD2 peptide and a shorter LD2 peptide lacking 8 N-terminal residues (residues 141-159) were also synthesized. Protein and peptide concentrations were measured using the BCA assay (Pierce) because the results lie within 5% of the determinations by amino acid composition analysis.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Protein solutions were dialyzed thoroughly against ITC buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm NaN3 at pH 7.0) and degassed prior to ITC measurements. For experiments at different temperatures, the pH was corrected to ensure constant pH. Titrations were conducted at the University of North Carolina Macromolecular Interactions Facility using a Microcal VP-ITC. The FAT domain or FAT domain variants (∼50 μm) were placed in the calorimetric cell and titrated with ∼1 mm LD2 peptide in the ITC buffer. The heat of association was obtained from the difference between the integrated heat of reaction and the corresponding heat of dilution. Data were analyzed using the ITC version of Origin 5.0 with embedded calorimetric fitting routines, with ΔH (the change in binding enthalpy, cal/mol) and Ka (the binding constant, m-1) as adjustable parameters. An ITC study was also conducted on a FAK homolog, Pyk2.Mapping the Binding Interface from Line Broadening by Gd-EDTA Paramagnetic Probe—Gd(III)-EDTA, a paramagnetic relaxation broadening reagent, was titrated into samples of uniformly 15N-enriched free and LD2-bound 15N-enriched FAT domain samples, and the effects of line broadening were compared as the difference in normalized height of amide HSQC peaks (42Arumugam S. Hemme C.L. Yoshida N. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Berjanskii M. Wu B. Van Doren S.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9650-9657Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two dimensional 1HN-15N HSQC spectra of 0.2 mm15N-labeled FAT domain samples, free or in complex with the LD2 peptide (molar ratio 1:8), were collected in the presence of a range of concentrations of 1:1 Gd(III)-EDTA (0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, 3.0, 6.0, and 9.0 mm). Line broadening was measured as a ratio of the height of a backbone amide peak at a given concentration of Gd(III)-EDTA to the height in the absence of the paramagnetic probe. Normalized heights of NH peaks obtained from the HSQC spectrum of the free FAT domain in the presence of 3 mm Gd(III)-EDTA were subtracted from normalized heights of NH peaks taken from the HSQC spectrum of the FAT domain-LD2 complex in the presence of 3 mm Gd(III)-EDTA.Interactions with Full-length Paxillin—GST fusion proteins were induced as described above. After immobilization on glutathione beads, the fusion proteins were used to test paxillin binding. CE cells were lysed in Tx-RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate) (34Thomas J.W. Cooley M.A. Broome J.M. Salgia R. Griffin J.D. Lombardo C.R. Schaller M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36684-36692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was determined by using the BCA assay. Lysates were pre-cleared with 50 μg of GST per 1 mg of lysate for 1 h at 4 °C. Then 500 μg of lysate was incubated with 6 μg of GST fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with Tx-RIPA and twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli's sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting using a paxillin monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). For expression in 293 cells, wild type FAK and mutants were subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Clontech). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). Seventy two hours post-transfection, cells were lysed in Tx-RIPA buffer and protein concentrations determined using the BCA assay. FAK was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of lysate using the BC4 polyclonal antiserum (26Shen Y. Schaller M.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2507-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 43Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were washed twice with Tx-RIPA buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer. Bound paxillin was detected by Western blotting by using a paxillin monoclonal antibody. The blot was then stripped and re-probed for FAK as a loading control.NMR Samples—Purified proteins were exchanged into NMR buffer (20 mm deuterated Tris maleate (Isotec, Miamisburg, OH), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% NaN3, and 10% D2O, pH 6.0), using centrifugal filter devices with a 10,000-dalton molecular weight cut-off BioMax membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Lyophilized LD2 peptide (protein/peptide molar ratio 1:8) was added into diluted protein solution (∼1.5 mg/ml). NMR samples of the FAT domain-LD2 complex were then concentrated to desired concentrations using an Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cell (model 8003) equipped with a 1,000-dalton molecular weight cut-off YM1 ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). 1 μmd-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone (Calbiochem) and 0.5 mg/ml pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science) were used in all NMR samples to inhibit residual thrombin remaining from GST cleavage during purification.NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were carried out at 310 K. 1H chemical shifts were referenced relative to an external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sample, whereas 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate as described (44Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar). Spectra were processed with NMRPipe program version 2.1 (45Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11379) Google Scholar) and analyzed by NMRView program version 5.0.4 (46Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar). A three-dimensional simultaneous 13C/15N-edited NOESY spectrum (75-ms mixing time) was collected on a Varian Inova 800 MHz spectrometer (47Pascal S.M. Muhandiram D.R. Yamazaki T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 103: 197-201Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To identify intermolecular contacts between the FAT domain and LD2 peptide, a pair of three-dimensional simultaneous 13C/15N edited NOESY spectra (100 ms mixing time) were also acquired under identical conditions on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer, with or without F1 decoupling during acquisition. All other spectra were collected on a Varian Inova 600-MHz spectrometer. Backbone sequential assignments were obtained manually from the following series of experiments on a 0.6 mm uniformly 13C/15N-labeled FAT protein with 4.8 mm unlabeled LD2 peptide: two-dimensional 1HN-15N TROSY HSQC (see representative spectrum in Supplemental Material Fig. 1), two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC, three-dimensional HNCA (48Ikura M.

Two dimensional 1HN-15N TROSY HSQC spectra were also collected on a 0.2 mm selectively [15N]Leu-labeled protein in complex with LD2 peptide, and a 0.2 mm [15N]Lys(-)-labeled protein in complex with LD2 peptide (protein/peptide molar ratio 1:8). These two spectra provided starting points for the assignments. Side chain assignments were achieved using the following experiments: three-dimensional HCCH-COSY (53Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 88: 425-431Google Scholar), three-dimensional HCCH-TOCSY (54Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Singer A.U. Muhandiram D.R. Formankay J.D. J. Magn.

Aromatic side chain assignments were obtained from two-dimensional (Hβ)Cβ(CγCδCϵ)Hϵ and two-dimensional (Hβ)Cβ(CγCδ)Hδ experiments (57Yamazaki T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11054-11055Crossref Scopus (394) Google Scholar). 1HN-15N residual dipolar coupling values were measured using 7.5 mg/ml Pf1 phage as aligning medium (ASLA Ltd., Riga, Latvia). The protein concentration was 0.25 mm, and peptide concentration was 2 mm. No significant spectral difference was observed in two-dimensional 1HN-15N HSQC spectra with and without phage. Two dimensional spectra were collected using gNhsqc_IPAP pulse sequence from ProteinPack (Varian) on the complex samples with and without Pf1 phage (58Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar).Structure Calculations—Results of the CSI predictions and the TALOS program were analyzed for identification of secondary structure elements (59Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, 60Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol.

The crystal structure (Protein Data Bank access code 1k40) from Hayashi et al. (39Hayashi I. Vuori K. Liddington R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) served as starting structure for calculations after minor modifications, because of small differences in the primary sequence between mouse and the avian FAT domain. The program Insight II (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) was used to append the 12-amino acid residue linker to the N terminus of the avian FAT domain and to substitute the following amino acid residues: T972S, I973L, A975V, G996A, S1000N, L1046I, G1047S, and T1049S. Dihedral angle constraints were derived from the Cα chemical shifts by using the program TALOS, which"
https://openalex.org/W2059572507,"We have previously demonstrated that Bcl-2 overexpression in human breast carcinoma and melanoma cells synergizes with hypoxia to increase angiogenesis through up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor. In this work we demonstrated, for the first time, that Bcl-2 overexpression in cancer cells exposed to hypoxia modulates urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) expression through Sp1 transcription factor and that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway plays a role in Sp1 transcriptional activity. In particular, an increase in uPAR protein and mRNA expression was found in melanoma bcl-2 transfectants grown under hypoxia when compared with control cells, and a decrease of uPAR protein expression was induced by treatment of cells with specific bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides. Up-regulation of uPAR expression was accompanied by increased Sp1 protein expression, stability, serine phosphorylation, and DNA binding activity. Treatment of cells with mitramycin A, an inhibitor of Sp1 activity, confirmed the role of Sp1 transcriptional activity in uPAR induction by Bcl-2. The contribution of the ERK pathway in Sp1-increased transcriptional activity was demonstrated by the use of chemical inhibition. In fact, ERK kinase activation was induced in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells exposed to hypoxia, and the ERK kinase inhibitor UO126 was able to down-regulate Sp1 phosphorylation and DNA binding activity. Using a human breast carcinoma line, we obtained data supporting our findings with melanoma cells and identified a link between the induction of Sp1 and uPAR expression as a common bcl-2-controlled phenomenon in human tumors. In conclusion, our results strongly indicate that up-regulation of uPAR expression by Bcl-2 in hypoxia is modulated by Sp1 DNA binding activity through the ERK signaling pathway.

In fact, ERK kinase activation was induced in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells exposed to hypoxia, and the ERK kinase inhibitor UO126 was able to down-regulate Sp1 phosphorylation and DNA binding activity. Using a human breast carcinoma line, we obtained data supporting our findings with melanoma cells and identified a link between the induction of Sp1 and uPAR expression as a common bcl-2-controlled phenomenon in human tumors. In conclusion, our results strongly indicate that up-regulation of uPAR expression by Bcl-2 in hypoxia is modulated by Sp1 DNA binding activity through the ERK signaling pathway. Angiogenesis is a fundamental process required for tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis and is strongly induced by hypoxia. In fact, several cell types including tumor cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells respond to hypoxia by producing angiogenic factors, fibrinolytic factors, and adhesion molecules involved in pathologic angiogenesis (1Desbaillets I.

Four sequential steps can be distinguished during angiogenesis: the degradation of the basement membrane and interstitial matrix, endothelial cell migration, endothelial cell proliferation, and the formation of tubular structures with a lumen and a new basement membrane (6Folkman J. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). Three of these steps critically depend on proteolytic activity generated by the matrix metalloproteinases and the plasminogen activator/plasmin system. In particular, the role of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) 1The abbreviations used are: uPAR, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor; uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; ADR, adriamycin; MTR, mitramycin A; CHX, cycloheximide; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. in tumor cell invasion and migration and in the formation of new microvascular structures has been largely demonstrated (7Min H.Y.

In this context, we previously demonstrated that the bcl-2 oncogene increases in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis in two different tumor histotypes (15Biroccio A. Candiloro A. Mottolese M. Sapora O.

In particular, we found an increase in the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) when breast carcinoma (15Biroccio A. Candiloro A. Mottolese M. Sapora O. Albini A. Zupi G. Del Bufalo D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and melanoma (16Iervolino A. Trisciuoglio D. Ribatti D. Candiloro A. Biroccio A. Zupi G. Del Bufalo D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1453-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) cells overexpressing Bcl-2 were exposed to hypoxic conditions. We also demonstrated that Bcl-2 overexpression in human melanoma cells enhances hypoxia-induced VEGF mRNA stability and promoter activation (16Iervolino A. Trisciuoglio D. Ribatti D. Candiloro A. Biroccio A. Zupi G. Del Bufalo D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1453-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and that treatment of melanoma cells with a bcl-2/bcl-xL antisense oligonucleotide induces antiangiogenic activity (17Del Bufalo D. Trisciuoglio D. Scarsella M. Zangemeister-Wittke U. Zupi G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8441-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The involvement of bcl-2 in angiogenesis of prostate carcinoma (18Fernandez A. Udagawa T. Schwesinger C. Beecken W. Achilles-Gerte E. McDonnell T. D'Amato R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and microvascular endothelial cells has also been described (19Nor J.E. Christensen J. Liu J. Peters M. Mooney D.J. Strieter R.M. Polverini P.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2183-2188PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the leading property of bcl-2 to inhibit apoptosis is associated with its ability to induce angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of Bcl-2 overexpression in the regulation of uPAR expression in human tumors. Since a minimal promoter region required for the basal transcription of the human uPAR gene has been demonstrated to contain GC-rich proximal sequences that are specifically bound by the transcription factor Sp1 (20Soravia E. Grebe A. De Luca P. Helin K. Suh T.T. Degen J.L. Blasi F. Blood. 1995; 86: 624-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Allgayer H. Wang H. Gallick G.E. Crabtree A. Mazar A. Jones T. Kraker A.J. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18428-18437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we also investigated whether the regulation of uPAR by Bcl-2 overexpression is due to the effect of Bcl-2 on Sp1 expression, phosphorylation, and DNA binding activity. To address the molecular mechanism that mediates the effect of Bcl-2, the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in Sp1 transcriptional activity was investigated. Our results demonstrate that Bcl-2 overexpression in hypoxia increases Sp1 expression and activity through ERK signaling with the result of enhanced uPAR transcription and expression. Cell Lines and Cell Cultures—M14 human melanoma cells, MCF7 ADR human breast carcinoma cells resistant to adriamycin (ADR), and Bcl-2-overexpressing clones, previously obtained after transfection (16Iervolino A. Trisciuoglio D. Ribatti D. Candiloro A. Biroccio A. Zupi G. Del Bufalo D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1453-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Del Bufalo D. Biroccio A. Leonetti C. Zupi G. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), were maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Hypoxic Treatment—Parental cells and bcl-2 transfectants were seeded and grown for 24 h in complete medium. Then cells were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium under normoxic or hypoxic conditions as reported previously (15Biroccio A. Candiloro A. Mottolese M. Sapora O. Albini A. Zupi G. Del Bufalo D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, counted, and used for protein preparation and total RNA extraction. Antisense Treatment—These studies were performed with antisense 2009, a 20-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide directed against the coding region (codons 141-147) of the bcl-2 messenger RNA. The antisense 2009 and the scrambled control sequence were previously described (23Ziegler A. Luedke G.H. Fabbro D. Altmann K.H. Stahel R.A. Zangemeister-Wittke U. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were delivered into cells in the form of complexes with the transfection reagent Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Lipofectin at 100 μg/ml was allowed to complex with oligonucleotides, and this solution was further diluted to the desired concentration in serum and antibiotic-free medium prior to addition to the cells. M14 parental cells and bcl-2 transfectants were incubated for 24 h in the presence of 300 nm oligonucleotides and Lipofectin and then exposed to hypoxia for 24 h in serum-free medium. ELISA and Western blot analyses were performed at the end of treatment. ELISA Analysis—To determine the amount of uPAR in the cell lysates and in tumor xenografts, an ELISA kit was used. The sensitivity of the uPAR assays was 0.1 ng/ml (American Diagnostica inc., Greenwich, CT). To evaluate in vitro uPAR expression, cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h in the absence or presence of 100 or 200 nm mitramycin A (MTR; Sigma) or were treated with bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide as reported above. Then cells were harvested, washed twice in PBS, resuspended, and counted. Cells were then centrifuged, and the pellet was lysed in lysis buffer (partial cell lysate). The combined trypsin/EDTA treatment leaves a complex material, referred to as surface-adherent material (24Del Rosso M. Pedersen N. Fibbi G. Pucci M. Dini G. Anichini E. Blasi F. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), on the culture dish, which primarily represents the cell focal contacts and is enriched with uPAR. Thus, the partial cell lysate was replaced in the culture dish for 1 h at 4 °C to lyse the surface-adherent material-associated uPAR (total cell lysate) as well. The total cell lysate was stirred for 12 h at 4 °C to allow an optimal solubilization of the cell extract and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to separate cell debris. The material was frozen and maintained at -80 °C. For in vivo analysis of uPAR expression, tumor xenografts (22Del Bufalo D. Biroccio A. Leonetti C. Zupi G. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (100-200 mg) was homogenized in 500 μl of lysis buffer. Homogenates were centrifuged (20 min at 16,000 × g), and the supernatant was used for uPAR protein analysis. Immunoprecipitation Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (16Iervolino A. Trisciuoglio D. Ribatti D. Candiloro A. Biroccio A. Zupi G. Del Bufalo D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1453-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Extracts from ∼3 × 106 cells (100 μl containing 200 μg of nuclear proteins) were diluted to 1 ml in whole-cell extraction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and inhibitor proteases and phosphatases) and incubated with 3 μl of polyclonal rabbit antibody to Sp1 (Pep2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. After the addition of 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the suspension was incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with 1.5 ml of cold extraction buffer, and resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. After the suspension was heated to 95 °C for 10 min, 20-μl samples were resolved on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to membranes. Anti-human anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies (Chemicon International, Temacula, CA) were used at dilutions of 1:500 and 1:100, respectively. Western Blot Analysis—For analysis of Sp1 protein expression, equal amounts of nuclear extracts (35 μg of protein) were fractionated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Monoclonal antibody against Sp1 (clone 1C6; BD Pharmigen Technical, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was used at a dilution of 1:200. For the Sp1 phosphorylation study, nuclear extracts obtained after 24 h of hypoxic treatment were treated for 60 min at 37 °C with 10 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs) before Western blot analysis. For the Sp1 stability study, cycloheximide (CHX; Calbiochem) at a dose of 10 μg/ml was added after 24 h of hypoxic treatment, and the cells were further incubated under hypoxia for varying times ranging from 30 min to 4 h. To evaluate uPAR and Bcl-2 expression and ERK1/ERK2 expression and phosphorylation, whole-cell protein extracts were electrophoresed on an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Anti-human uPAR mouse monoclonal antibody (American Diagnostica Inc.) was used at a 1:400 dilution. Anti-human Bcl-2 mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 124; Dako s.p.a., Milan, Italy) was used at a 1:200 dilution. To detect phospho-ERKs, the phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) was used at a 1:1000 dilution; to probe total ERK1 and ERK2, the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). To check the amount of proteins transferred to the nitrocellulose membranes, β-actin or heat shock protein (Hsp70/72) was used as control and detected by an anti-β-actin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-Hsp70/72 monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem) at a 1:1000 dilution. Densitometric analysis was performed after Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis of ERK1/ERK2 and Sp1 expression and phosphorylation was performed in the absence or presence of ERK inhibitor UO126 (10 μm; Calbiochem). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared, and Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (15Biroccio A. Candiloro A. Mottolese M. Sapora O. Albini A. Zupi G. Del Bufalo D.

Del Bufalo D. Baldini N. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were used. Promoter Activity—For transient transfection, 3 × 105 cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes, and 24 h later each dish was transfected with 6 μg of pGL3-mouse uPAR promoter vector kindly provided by Dr. A. Maity (28Maity A. Solomon D. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected in triplicates with an internal control PEQ-176 plasmid (1.5 μg) using a calcium-phosphate method (Promega Italia, Milan, Italy). Twenty-four h later, half of the dishes were subjected to hypoxia, and the other half were kept under normoxic conditions. Samples were collected 24 h after the induction of hypoxia and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Relative luciferase expression was determined as a ratio of β-galactosidase activity. The mean of five independent experiments was calculated for each condition. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Cells were exposed for 24 h to hypoxia in the presence or absence of the Sp1 inhibitor MTR (100 or 200 nm) or ERK inhibitor UO126 (10 μm). Then nuclear proteins were prepared as described for immunoprecipitation, and EMSA was performed as previously described (29Ricca A. Biroccio A. Del Bufalo D. Mackay A.R. Santoni A. Cippitelli M. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. The following double-stranded oligomer-containing Sp1 consensus sequence was used as labeled probes (104 cpm) or cold competitor (100 ng): 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ (30Zannetti A. Del Vecchio S. Carriero M.V. Fonti R. Franco P. Botti G. D'Aiuto G. Stoppelli M.P. Salvatore M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1546-1551PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the specificity of DNA-binding complexes, supershift with Sp1 (Pep2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Sp3 (D-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies was performed by preincubating nuclear extracts with the antibody (2 μg) for 30 min prior to the addition of labeled DNA probe. Statistical Analysis—Multiple comparisons were performed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test after demonstration of significant differences among medians by nonparametric variance analysis according to Kruskal-Wallis. Bcl-2 Overexpression Increases uPAR Protein Expression under Hypoxic Conditions—We previously demonstrated the ability of Bcl-2 to synergize with hypoxia to increase angiogenesis in melanoma and breast carcinoma cells (15Biroccio A. Candiloro A. Mottolese M. Sapora O. Albini A. Zupi G. Del Bufalo D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Iervolino A. Trisciuoglio D. Ribatti D. Candiloro A. Biroccio A. Zupi G. Del Bufalo D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1453-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Since uPAR plays an important role in angiogenesis (7Min H.Y. Doyle L.V. Vitt C.R. Zandonella C.L. Stratton-Thomas J.R. Shuman M.A. Rosenberg S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2428-2433PubMed Google Scholar, 8Evans C.P. Elfman F. Parangi S. Conn M. Cunha G.

Pathol. 1999; 154: 1731-1742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether uPAR was also involved in the Bcl-2-induced angiogenesis. For this purpose, two Bcl-2-overexpressing clones, previously obtained after transfection of the M14 parental melanoma line (16Iervolino A. Trisciuoglio D. Ribatti D. Candiloro A. Biroccio A. Zupi G. Del Bufalo D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1453-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), were used. We first determined the levels of cell-associated uPAR protein in the M14 cell line, the MN8 control clone, and two bcl-2 transfectants (MB5 and MB6) grown under normoxic (Fig. 1A, white columns) and hypoxic (black columns) conditions for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, the difference in uPAR amounts measured in the control lines and bcl-2-transfected clones were not statistically significant when cells were grown under normoxic conditions. In hypoxia, the M14 parental line and the MN8 control clone did not show significant differences, neither when compared with normoxic conditions nor between each other. On the contrary, the two bcl-2 transfectants grown in hypoxia showed significantly higher levels of uPAR protein than in normoxia (∼2-fold increase). To confirm the role of bcl-2 in the regulation of uPAR expression, Bcl-2 protein expression was down-regulated both in the M14 parental cells and the MB5 and MB6 bcl-2 transfectants using 2009 antisense oligonucleotide (23Ziegler A. Luedke G.H. Fabbro D. Altmann K.H. Stahel R.A. Zangemeister-Wittke U. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1027-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) before cells were exposed to hypoxia for 24 h. Western blot analysis of Bcl-2 expression (Fig. 1B) showed that bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment decreased Bcl-2 protein levels by about 45 and 60% in parental cells and in the two transfectants, respectively. Performing ELISA assays, also a decrease of the level of uPAR protein in parental cells by about 40% was observed. The reduction in the two bcl-2 transfectants was about 60-70% (Fig. 1C). Down-regulation of uPAR expression in bcl-2 transfectants by bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide treatment was also confirmed by Western blot. As revealed in Fig. 1D, antisense treatment induced about 60% inhibition of uPAR expression in both clones. The scrambled sequence oligonucleotide did not affect Bcl-2 or uPAR expression. These results confirm a link between Bcl-2 and uPAR expression. Bcl-2 Overexpression Increases uPAR mRNA Expression and Promoter Activity under Hypoxic Conditions—Because uPAR expression can be modulated by transcriptional regulation (28Maity A. Solomon D. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we were interested to know the mechanism through which Bcl-2 synergizes with hypoxia to induce uPAR expression. To this end, we determined whether transactivation of the uPAR promoter differently occurred in control cells and the bcl-2 transfectants (Fig. 2A). Transient transfections were performed using the uPAR promoter coupled to the luciferase-reporter gene (28Maity A. Solomon D. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and control and Bcl-2-overexpressing cells were exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, under normoxic conditions, uPAR promoter activity was low and similar in all cells tested, regardless of the level of Bcl-2 protein. Exposure to hypoxia induced a slight increase in promoter activity in control cells, whereas an increase of about 4-fold was observed in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. In the MN8 control clone, the uPAR promoter response was comparable with that of M14 both in normoxia and hypoxia (data not shown). Since the steady-state level of mRNA also represents a control point for uPAR expression (28Maity A. Solomon D. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of Bcl-2 on uPAR at the transcriptional level. Northern blot analysis of uPAR mRNA was performed after exposure of M14 parental line, MN8 control clone, and two bcl-2 transfectants (MB5 and MB6) to hypoxic conditions for 24 h (Fig. 2B). An increase of about 2-fold of uPAR mRNA expression was observed in both bcl-2 transfectants, compared with the M14 parental line and MN8 control clone exposed to hypoxia for 24 h. Sp1 Protein Stability and Phosphorylation Is Increased in bcl-2 Transfectants Exposed to Hypoxia—A minimal promoter region, containing GC-rich proximal sequences that are specifically bound by the transcription factor Sp1, has been identified for the basal transcriptional activity of the human uPAR gene (20Soravia E. Grebe A. De Luca P. Helin K. Suh T.T. Degen J.L. Blasi F. Blood. 1995; 86: 624-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Allgayer H. Wang H. Gallick G.E. Crabtree A. Mazar A. Jones T. Kraker A.J. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18428-18437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The regulation of Sp1-dependent transcription can be affected by changes in the overall amount of Sp1 or in transactivation activity due to biochemical modifications such as phosphorylation (31Black A.R.

To address this issue, we analyzed Sp1 protein expression, stability, and phosphorylation in M14 parental cells, the MN8 control clone, and the MB5 and MB6 bcl-2 transfectants grown in normoxia or exposed to hypoxia for 24 h. To evaluate the effect of Bcl-2 on Sp1 mRNA expression, Northern blot analysis was performed 24 h after exposure to hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3A). Similar levels of Sp1 were observed between the control lines and the bcl-2 transfectants grown in hypoxia. The expression of Sp1 was also analyzed at the protein level. A representative Western blot analysis of Sp1 protein in nuclear extracts is shown in Fig. 3B. As expected, Sp1 protein migrates as two bands with molecular masses of 95 and 105 kDa. The two species are the result of differential post-translational modification of the Sp1 polypeptide, corresponding to the unphosphorylated (lower band) and phosphorylated (upper band) protein (37Schewe D.M. Leupold J.H. Boyd D.D. Lengyel E.R. Wang H. Gruetzner K.U. Schildberg F.W. Jauch K.W. Allgayer H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2267-2276PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas no differences in Sp1 expression between control and Bcl-2-overexpressing cells were observed under normoxic conditions (data not shown), after 24 h of hypoxia, an increase in both bands was observed in the bcl-2 transfectants compared with parental cells. In particular, densitometric analysis revealed an increase of about 2- and 3-fold in the lower and the phosphorylated higher molecular weight forms of Sp1, respectively. To assess whether Bcl-2 overexpression stabilizes the Sp1 protein, we monitored the levels of Sp1 protein after blocking de novo protein synthesis by CHX treatment. To this end, the M14 parental line and a representative bcl-2 transfectant (MB5) were exposed to hypoxia for 24 h and then treated, under hypoxia, with 10 μg/ml CHX for varying times ranging from 30 min to 4 h (Fig. 3C). Western blot analysis showed a rapid decay of Sp1 protein in M14 parental cells within 30 min and Sp1 was hardly detectable 2 h after the start of CHX treatment. In contrast, Sp1 protein levels in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells remained stable during the first 2 h of CHX treatment and then gradually but slowly decreased about 40% within 4 h.

We previously showed that the IL-2 receptor induces expression of cyclin D2 by activating the transcription factor Stat5, which binds directly and immediately to a site upstream of the cyclin D2 promoter. We show here that subsequent transcription of the cyclin D2 gene occurs by a delayed, cycloheximide-sensitive mechanism, which implies the involvement of additional regulatory mechanisms. The transcription factor c-Myc is induced by Stat5 and is reported to bind to two E box motifs in the cyclin D2 promoter. However, in IL-2-stimulated T cells, c-Myc does not appear to be involved in cyclin D2 induction, since we found that these two E boxes are preferentially bound by USF-1 and USF-2 and, moreover, are dispensable for cyclin D2 promoter activity. Instead, we found that Stat5 activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) pathway by a delayed, cycloheximide-sensitive mechanism and that PI3 kinase activity is essential for the induction of cyclin D2 by Stat5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PI3 kinase is required for the optimal binding of RNA polymerase II to the promoters of cyclin D2 as well as other genes. Our results reveal a novel link between PI3 kinase and RNA polymerase II promoter binding activity and demonstrate discrete, coordinated roles for the PI3 kinase and Stat5 pathways in cyclin D2 transcription.

A hallmark feature of the immune response is the ability of resting T cells to undergo rapid clonal expansion in response to antigen stimulation.

Critical downstream events in this process are the increased expression of D- and E-type cyclins, which bind and up-regulate the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases 2, 4, and 6 (2Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). These complexes phosphorylate retinoblastoma family proteins, thereby causing the derepression of E2F transcription factors, which in turn promote cell cycle progression (3Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). Of the three D-type cyclin genes present in mammals, cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 are up-regulated in response to IL-2 in T cells (4Turner J.M. Int.

The IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) is a trimeric complex of three transmembrane proteins, termed α, β, and γc (1Nelson B.H. Willerford D.M. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 1-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the α subunit functions primarily to increase ligand affinity, signaling is initiated by the IL-2 induced heterodimerization of the β and γc subunits (5Nakamura Y. Russell S.M. Mess S.A.

Nature. 1994; 369: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This results in the activation of the Jak1 and Jak3 tyrosine kinases, which are associated with the intracellular domains of the β and γc subunits, respectively (7Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev.

Once activated, the Jak kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the IL-2Rβ chain, which then serve as docking sites for the recruitment of downstream signaling effectors. Earlier studies by our group and others have delineated two distinct proliferative signaling pathways downstream of the IL-2R (9Friedmann M.C. Migone T.S. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

One is mediated by the adaptor molecule Shc, which binds to phosphorylated tyrosine 338 of IL-2Rβ (13Ravichandran K.S. Igras V. Shoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The other is mediated by the transcription factor Stat5, which associates with phosphorylated tyrosines 392 and 510 of IL-2Rβ (9Friedmann M.C. Migone T.S. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2077-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although the molecular signaling mechanisms of these two pathways contrast considerably, each can independently generate a proliferative signal that is characterized by the induction of several promitogenic genes, including c-myc, cyclin D2, cyclin D3, cyclin E, bcl-2, and bcl-xL (11Lord J.D.

The Shc pathway is composed of at least two major branches: the Ras/Erk pathway, which is activated through a Shc-Grb2-Sos complex, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) pathway, which is activated through a Shc-Grb2-Gab2 complex (15Ravichandran K.S.

The Erk pathway has well established roles in several aspects of cell cycle control (21Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) but is not required for the IL-2R-mediated induction of D- and E-type cyclins (14Moon J.J. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, PI3 kinase is essential for the induction of cyclin D2 and cyclin D3 by the Shc pathway in T cells (14Moon J.J. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and in fibroblasts this pathway is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of cyclin D1 (22Dufourny B. Alblas J. van Teeffelen H.A. van Schaik F.M. van der B.B. Steenbergh P.H. Sussenbach J.S. J. Biol.

In addition to its role in inducing D-type cyclin expression, the PI3 kinase pathway enhances cyclin-dependent kinase function by down-regulating activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 (24Brennan P.

Stat5 is also clearly implicated in D-type cyclin induction. T cells from Stat5a/b-deficient mice fail to express cyclin D2 or cyclin D3 in response to anti-CD3 or IL-2 treatment (28Moriggl R. Topham D.J. Teglund S. Sexl V. McKay C. Wang D. Hoffmeyer A. van Deursen J. Sangster M.Y. Bunting K.D. Grosveld G.C. Ihle J.N. Immunity. 1999; 10: 249-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In the pancreatic β-cell line INS-1, a dominant negative form of Stat5 partially inhibited growth hormone-mediated expression of cyclin D2 (29Friedrichsen B.N. Galsgaard E.D. Nielsen J.H. Moldrup A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas a constitutively active version of Stat5 induced cyclin D2 expression (30Friedrichsen B.N. Richter H.E. Hansen J.A. Rhodes C.J. Nielsen J.H. Billestrup N. Moldrup A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 945-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized a Stat5 binding element in the cyclin D2 promoter that is responsive to IL-2R signaling in T cells (31Martino A. Holmes J.H. Lord J.D. Moon J.J. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This site is adjacent to an Sp1 binding site, and the binding of both Stat5 and Sp1 is required to achieve full activity of the promoter. A Stat5 binding element has also been identified in the cyclin D1 promoter (32Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C. Downward J. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1367-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although the Stat5 and PI3 kinase pathways have each been implicated in the regulation of D-type cyclin expression, the mechanism by which these two signals are integrated remains undefined. In the present study, we use mutant IL-2 receptors to demonstrate that Stat5 activation results in a late wave of PI3 kinase pathway activity. Studies with PI3 kinase inhibitors demonstrate that PI3 kinase is required for cyclin D2 induction by Stat5. This requirement does not pertain to the activation of Stat5 itself but rather to the ability of RNA polymerase II to bind to the cyclin D2 promoter. Therefore, the Stat5 and PI3 kinase pathways play distinct, coordinated roles in the IL-2R-mediated induction of cyclin D2. Cell Culture—The murine IL-2-dependent T cell line CTLL-2 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 units/ml human recombinant IL-2 (Chiron, Emeryville, CA).

For cold competitor studies, a 10-fold molar excess of unradiolabeled DNA corresponding to the Stat5 binding GAS element in the FcγRI promoter was added to nuclear extracts prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. For supershifting studies, 0.5–2.0 μg of normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027) or antibody to USF-1 (sc-229X), USF-2 (sc-862X), or Stat5 (sc-836X) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to nuclear extracts and incubated on ice for 15 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe.

Antibodies to Stat5 (sc-835) and RNA polymerase II (sc-899) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitated DNA was extracted and subjected to duplex PCR using the murine β-globin gene as a neutral, nonenriched reference.

Stat5-mediated Cyclin D2 Expression Is Delayed and Requires de Novo Protein Synthesis—Studies were performed in the murine IL-2-dependent CD8+ T cell line CTLL-2. Chimeric GM-CSF/IL-2 receptors were used where indicated to study distinct signaling pathways by receptor mutagenesis. As previously described, these receptors are composed of the extracellular ligand binding domain of the GM-CSF receptor β and α subunits fused to the transmembrane and intracellular signaling domains of the IL-2 receptor β and γ subunits, respectively, to yield ββwt and αγwt (Fig. 1A) (6Nelson B.H. Lord J.D. Greenberg P.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 12Lord J.D. McIntosh B.C. Greenberg P.D. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2533-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells expressing ββwt and αγwt with GM-CSF produces an IL-2-like signal. To study the Stat5 signal in the absence of other IL-2Rβ-dependent signals such as Shc, we utilized ββΔ325+Y510, a minimal form of ββwt that contains Jak binding sites and a single tyrosine residue (Tyr510) that mediates a robust proliferative signal through Stat5 (12Lord J.D. McIntosh B.C. Greenberg P.D. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2533-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14Moon J.J. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previous work by our group has identified cyclin D2 as a direct Stat5 target gene (31Martino A. Holmes J.H. Lord J.D. Moon J.J. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, despite the fact that Stat5 is activated within minutes of receptor ligation, Northern blot analysis revealed that cyclin D2 mRNA is not induced by either the wild type IL-2R or ββΔ325+Y510 receptor signal until at least 3 h after stimulation (Fig. 1, B and C). These kinetics contrast with the relatively rapid induction of other Stat5 target genes, including c-myc, CIS, and bcl-xL (Fig. 1C) (12Lord J.D. McIntosh B.C. Greenberg P.D. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2533-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 36Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A.

Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). To determine whether the slow induction of cyclin D2 reflects a requirement for de novo protein synthesis, we applied the translation inhibitor cycloheximide to cells expressing ββΔ325+Y510. Cycloheximide treatment did not affect Stat5 phosphorylation or the induction of c-myc, CIS, or bcl-xL, which is consistent with their classification as immediate early genes. By contrast, cycloheximide completely inhibited the induction of cyclin D2. These results suggest that, unlike other Stat5 target genes, cyclin D2 expression requires additional factors that are cycloheximide-sensitive, presumably because they are either labile or newly synthesized upon receptor activation. IL-2-induced Cyclin D2 Transcription Is Not Mediated through Promoter-proximal E Box Motifs—Previous studies have suggested a role for c-Myc in the transcriptional activation of the cyclin D2 gene (38Bouchard C.

In these studies, activated Myc-Max complexes were found to bind two conserved E box motifs located upstream of the cyclin D2 translational start site. Because c-myc mRNA and protein expression are strongly induced by Stat5 within 1–3 h of IL-2 stimulation (Fig. 1C and data not shown), we evaluated whether c-Myc might represent the cycloheximide-sensitive factor required for cyclin D2 induction by ββΔ325+Y510. In the human cyclin D2 gene, the E boxes reportedly bound by Myc-Max are located at positions -1596 bp (E box 1) and -1425 bp (E box 2) relative to the translational start site (38Bouchard C.

We have previously shown via deletional analysis of a human cyclin D2 luciferase reporter gene that the region between -1624 and -1303 bp is not required for IL-2-inducible reporter gene activity (31Martino A. Holmes J.H. Lord J.D. Moon J.J. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because the two conserved E boxes are located within this region of the promoter, this would suggest that they are not important for the IL-2-mediated induction of cyclin D2. However, in light of the aforementioned studies, we reevaluated the functional activity of these E boxes by directly mutating them in a full-length cyclin D2-luciferase reporter construct. Specifically, we created reporter constructs containing the upstream 1624-bp region of the human cyclin D2 gene with either both E boxes intact, E box 1 mutated only, E box 2 mutated only, or both E boxes mutated. As a negative control, we used a reporter construct containing only the first 444 bp upstream of the cyclin D2 gene, which we have previously shown to be nonresponsive to IL-2 (31Martino A. Holmes J.H. Lord J.D. Moon J.J. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consistent with prior results, after transient transfection into CTLL-2 cells, the full-length, wild type cyclin D2-luciferase reporter gene was induced ∼3-fold in response to IL-2, whereas the reporter gene with the -444 deletion showed no significant induction (Fig. 2A). The three constructs containing singly or doubly mutated E boxes were induced to the same level as the full-length, wild type reporter gene. Therefore, neither E box 1 nor E box 2 appears to contribute significantly to the IL-2-mediated induction of cyclin D2 in T cells. To directly test whether Myc-Max complexes bind to these E boxes, we conducted EMSAs using DNA probes representing the two E box sequences. Both E boxes were constitutively bound by a factor that was present in unstimulated cells and maintained throughout 6 h of IL-2 stimulation (Fig. 2B). The addition of antibodies to c-Myc or Max did not result in the supershifting of the E box probes (data not shown), but antibodies to the transcription factors USF-1 or USF-2, which are both known to bind E box motifs (41Kerkhoff E. Bister K. Klempnauer K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4323-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), eliminated the E box 2 EMSA band at all time points (Fig. 2B). Thus, in T cells, c-Myc does not appear to contribute to cyclin D2 induction by the IL-2R, given that E box 1 and E box 2 are not required for inducible reporter gene activity and appear to constitutively bind the transcription factors USF-1 and USF-2 rather than Myc-Max or Mad-Max complexes. Stat5 Induces Delayed Activation of the PI3 Kinase Pathway—Since it appeared unlikely that c-Myc was a critical coregulator of cyclin D2 induction, we considered a possible role for the PI3 kinase pathway. This hypothesis stemmed from earlier reports that PI3 kinase is involved in D-type cyclin expression (14Moon J.J. Nelson B.H. J.

Mayeux P. Gisselbrecht S. Gouilleux F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, our own studies have demonstrated the ability of PI3 kinase to potentiate Stat5- mediated proliferation in T cells (14Moon J.J. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown that rapid activation of the PI3 kinase pathway by the IL-2R occurs through the Shc pathway and that signals from the Jak kinases and Stat5 are not capable of mediating this event (14Moon J.J.

However, this issue has not been adequately addressed at later time points, in particular the 3–6 h time period during which cyclin D2 induction occurs. As shown previously, stimulation of the endogenous wild type IL-2R induced phosphorylation of the PI3 kinase effectors Akt and p70S6 kinase (43Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 44Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar, 45Dufner A.

Although the ββΔ325+Y510 receptor did not induce rapid phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6 kinase, it consistently induced a modest level of phosphorylation of these kinases after 3 h of stimulation (Fig. 3A).

Here, we provide evidence for the epigenetic downregulation in breast tumors of the A Desintegrin And Metalloprotease domain 23 gene (ADAM 23), a member of a new family of surface molecules with roles in cell–cell adhesion and/or cell–matrix interactions. We examined the mRNA expression and methylation status of the 5′ upstream region of the ADAM23 gene in different breast tumor cell lines as well as in primary breast tumors. We found ADAM23 5′ hypermethylation in eight out of 12 (66.7%) tumor cell lines and in nine out of 13 (69.2%) primary tumors. Promoter hypermethylation was strongly associated with reductions in both mRNA and protein expression, with a threshold of 40–60% of modified CpG dinucleotides being required for the complete silencing of ADAM23 mRNA expression. Treatment of MCF-7 and SKBR-3 cell lines with 5′-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine led to a reactivation of ADAM23 mRNA expression and a marked decrease in the methylation level. It is worth noting that primary breast tumors with a more advanced grade showed a higher degree of methylation, suggesting that the adhesion molecule ADAM23 may be downregulated during the progression of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2058552501,"The 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome is an aggressive disorder caused by FGFR1 fusion proteins resulting from a subset of acquired translocations that target chromosome band 8p11. These chimeric proteins have constitutive FGFR1 tyrosine kinase activity and are believed to deregulate hemopoietic development in a manner analogous to BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia. Here we have studied the role of STAT proteins in transformation mediated by the most common of these fusions, ZNF198-FGFR1. We found that STATs 1, 3, and 5 were activated constitutively in ZNF198-FGFR1-transformed Ba/F3 cells and that STATs 2, 4, and 6 were also tyrosine-phosphorylated. Induction of dominant negative STAT mutants showed that activation of STAT5, but not STATs 1 or 3, was essential for the anti-apoptotic effect of ZNF198-FGFR1 and that STAT5 activation is essential for the elevated levels of BclXL in transformed cells. STAT5 activation was also shown to be required for continued cell cycle progression of BaF3/ZNF198-FGFR1 cells in conditions of cytokine deprivation and for up-regulation of the DNA repair protein Rad51. These findings suggest a critical role of STAT5 activation in transformation mediated by ZNF198-FGFR1."

https://openalex.org/W2051206301,"DNA damage-induced ubiquitination of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, Rpb1, has been implicated in transcription-coupled repair for years. The studies so far, however, have been limited to the use of bulky helix-distorting DNA damages caused by UV light and cisplatin, which are corrected by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Non-bulky, non-helix-distorting damages are caused at high frequency by reactive oxygen species in cells and corrected by the base excision repair pathway. Contrary to a classic view, we recently found that the second type of DNA lesions also causes RNA polymerase II stalling in vitro. In this paper, we show that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) causes significant ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Rpb1 by mechanisms that are distinct from those employed after UV irradiation. UV irradiation and H2O2 treatment cause characteristic changes in protein kinases phosphorylating the carboxyl-terminal domain at Ser-2 and -5. The H2O2-induced ubiquitination is likely dependent on unusual Ser-5 phosphorylation by ERK1/2. Moreover, the H2O2-induced ubiquitination occurs on transcriptionally engaged polymerases without the help of Cockayne syndrome A and B proteins and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor proteins, which are all required for the UV-induced ubiquitination. These results suggest that stalled polymerases are recognized and ubiquitinated differentially depending on the types of DNA lesions.

Biochem. 2003; 72: 693-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). RNAPII consists of 12 subunits. The largest subunit, Rpb1, contains a unique C-terminal domain (CTD) that consists of the heptapeptide Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser that is repeated 26 times in yeast and 52 times in mammals. RNAPII undergoes at least three types of post-translational modifications, i.e. phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation (3Oelgeschlager T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These modifications are likely to play important roles in RNAPII regulation. Of the modifications listed above, phosphorylation of the CTD has been the most studied and appreciated. The CTD is a target for several protein kinases including the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 7, CDK8, CDK9, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), DNA-dependent protein kinase, and c-Abl (3Oelgeschlager T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Besides the tyrosine kinase c-Abl that targets Tyr-1 of the CTD (8Baskaran R. Dahmus M.E. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11167-11171Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the known CTD kinases predominantly target either Ser-2 or -5. Although there is some inconsistency in the literature, it is generally thought that CDK7, a component of the transcription factor (TF) IIH, is a major Ser-5 kinase, whereas CDK9, a component of positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEF) b, is a major Ser-2 kinase within cells (3Oelgeschlager T.

Phosphates on the CTD are removed by CTD-specific phosphatases including Fcp1 (12Yeo M. Lin P.S. Dahmus M.E. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26078-26085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). CTD phosphorylation is dynamically regulated during the transcription cycle and thought to play an important role in efficient transcription elongation and mRNA processing. For example, TFIIH-mediated Ser-5 phosphorylation in the promoter-proximal region promotes mRNA capping (13Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). P-TEFb-mediated Ser-2 phosphorylation reverses transcription repression imposed by the negative transcription elongation factors (14Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Little is known about the roles, if any, of the CTD phosphorylation by other kinases. Rpb1 is also ubiquitinated upon exposure of the cells to UV light or cisplatin (4Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This modification leads to its rapid proteasomal degradation. Although direct evidence is lacking, it is suggested that the modification is involved in TCR (1Svejstrup J.Q. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 4Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Wang D. Lippard S.J. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4239-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The rationale is as follows. DNA lesions within the coding region often block the progression of RNA polymerases. Stalled polymerases are intrinsically inhibitory to DNA repair, because they prevent access of repair enzymes to damaged sites. These polymerases therefore need to be removed, possibly by proteolysis. The process, called TCR, enables cells to remove DNA lesions in the coding region considerably faster than those in the genome overall. Cockayne syndrome A (CSA) and B (CSB) proteins are involved in TCR and, in accordance with their predicted roles, are required for UV-induced ubiquitination and degradation of Rpb1 (4Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Recently, Kuznetsova et al. (15Kuznetsova A.V. Meller J. Schnell P.O. Nash J.A. Ignacak M.L. Sanchez Y. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2706-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL)-associated complex is the E3 enzyme responsible for UV-induced ubiquitination of Rpb1. According to another report (16Na X. Duan H.O. Messing E.M. Schoen S.R. Ryan C.K. di Sant'Agnese P.A. Golemis E.A. Wu G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4249-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), pVHL also targets the Rpb7 subunit of RNAPII for ubiquitination. UV-induced ubiquitination of Rpb1 appears to depend on its phosphorylation on the CTD. Supporting this idea is the observation that inhibition of CTD phosphorylation by the protein kinase inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) prevents the UV-induced ubiquitination (17Luo Z. Zheng J. Lu Y. Bregman D.B. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We seek to understand more about the covalent modifications of RNAPII. As for ubiquitination, the causal relationships between DNA lesions and ubiquitination and between ubiquitination and DNA repair remain to be elucidated. There are various types of DNA lesions that are corrected through different mechanisms. Therefore we have tested several DNA-damaging agents to see whether any of them induce Rpb1 ubiquitination. This search was fueled in part by a recent discovery (18Le Page F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) that TCR is not limited to the NER pathway, which corrects DNA lesions induced by UV light and cisplatin. Among the DNA-damaging agents we tested, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) significantly induced Rpb1 ubiquitination. H2O2 causes oxidative DNA damages that are mainly corrected by the BER pathway. In this paper, we describe a characterization of H2O2-induced ubiquitination of Rpb1 and discuss its potential role in the TCR of oxidatively damaged DNA. Cell Culture—HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. 786-O human renal carcinoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Simian virus 40-immortalized human fibroblasts WI38VA13 (WT), CS3BE-SV (CSA), and CS1AN-SV (CSB) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. These cells were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were irradiated with 254 nm of UV light at 15 J/m2 using the UV Stratalinker 2400 (Strat-agene) or treated with 10 mm H2O2 (Sigma) for 15 min and then recovered for various times. Where indicated, 50 μm DRB, 30 μm U0126, 5 μm SB203580, 30 μm SP600125, 100 μm MG132, or 25 μg/ml cycloheximide were added to cells 30 min before UV or H2O2 treatment. Stock solutions of DRB (10 mm, Sigma) and cycloheximide (10 mg/ml, Sigma) were prepared using 100% ethanol, whereas those of U0126 (10 mm, Calbiochem), SB203580 (10 mm, Calbiochem), SP600125 (20 mm, Calbiochem), and MG132 (10 mm, Sigma) were prepared using dimethyl sulfoxide. As seen in Fig. 5, cell viability was quantified by a soluble tetrazolium/formazan assay. Cells were trypsinized, 100-μl aliquots (equal to ∼103–104 cells) were incubated with 10 μl of the live cell counting reagent SF (Nacalai) for 1 h on 96-well plates, and absorbance at 450 nm was read using microplate reader model 450 (Bio-Rad). Immunological Analysis—To detect Rpb1, N20 (Santa Cruz), H5 (Covance), and H14 (Covance) were used. N20 recognizes the most N termini and therefore reacts with both the IIo and IIa forms of Rpb1. H5 and H14 recognize the Ser-2- and the Ser-5-phosphorylated CTD, respectively (19Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4689-4694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To detect ERK1/2, anti-p44/p42 and E10 (Cell Signaling) were used. The former recognizes total ERK1/2, whereas the latter recognizes an active Thr-202- and Tyr-204-phosphorylated form. In addition, anti-Lamin A/C antibody (346, Santa Cruz), anti-α-tubulin antibody (B-7, Santa Cruz), and anti-C/EBPβ antibody (Δ198, Santa Cruz) were used. For immunoblotting, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40). Whole cell extracts (10 μg) were resolved by 7 or 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For immunofluorescence microscopy, WI38VA13 cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (1:200, ICN). Coverslips were mounted on slide glasses using Vectashield with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector) and examined under a fluorescence microscope (BX51, Olympus). Analysis of Ubiquitinated Proteins—HF3 cells are HeLa-derivative cells that constitutively express His- and FLAG-tagged Rpb3. As shown previously (20Hasegawa J. Endou M. Narita T. Yamada T. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), an active RNAPII complex is purified to near homogeneity from the cells by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography alone or in combination with nickel affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1B, whole cell extracts were prepared from HeLa or HF3 cells that were either untreated or treated with H2O2. The extracts (200 μg) were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) in high salt buffer for 2 h. The matrices were washed five times with the same buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide as recommended by the manufacturer (Sigma). The eluate materials were immunoblotted with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (clone FK2, MBL) that specifically recognizes multi-ubiquitin chains. As shown in Fig. 1C, affinity matrices that are comprised of a GST fusion protein containing the ubiquitin-associated domains of Rad23 conjugated to glutathione-agarose (ubiquitinated protein enrichment kit, Calbiochem) were used for the enrichment of ubiquitinated proteins. The affinity matrices were incubated with untreated or H2O2-treated HeLa cell extracts (200 μg) in high salt buffer for 2 h. Then, the matrices were washed five times with the same buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer. Fractionation of Cellular Proteins—Fractionation of cellular proteins was performed as described (21Kamiuchi S. Saijo M. Citterio E. de Jager M. Hoeijmakers J.H. Tanaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with slight modification. WI38VA13 cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in modified cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm Pipes (pH 6.8), 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 7500 × g for 3 min. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in modified cytoskeleton buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100, incubated in the presence of 1 mg/ml DNase I at 30 °C for 1 h, and centrifuged at 7500 × g for 3 min. The pellet was extracted with modified cytoskeleton buffer containing 2 m NaCl at 4 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min to separate supernatant and pellet. H2O2-induced Ubiquitination of Rpb1—We examined whether any modification of Rpb1 occurs in H2O2-treated cells. HeLa cells were irradiated with 254 nm of UV light at 15 J/m2 or treated with 10 mm H2O2 for 15 min and recovered for various times. Then, whole cell extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-Rpb1 antibody H14. H14 recognizes the Ser-5-phosphorylated CTD and also has been used to detect ubiquitinated Rpb1 following UV irradiation (4Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17Luo Z. Zheng J. Lu Y. Bregman D.B. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, H2O2 treatment resulted in the appearance of smeared H14-reactive bands with a significantly slower mobility than that of the normally phosphorylated IIo form (lane 11). Consistent with earlier reports (4Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17Luo Z. Zheng J. Lu Y. Bregman D.B. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), UV irradiation also caused the appearance of smeared bands (lane 4), which are ubiquitinated Rpb1 (data not shown). Ubiquitination of Rpb1 occurred transiently with a peak at 1 h after UV irradiation. The kinetics for the H2O2-induced modification is similar to that for the UV-induced ubiquitination. In contrast, the band pattern of the H2O2-induced modification is quite different from that of the UV-induced ubiquitination. Even at higher doses of UV irradiation, greater mobility shift of Rpb1 was not observed (data not shown), suggesting that the modifications induced by UV light and H2O2 are qualitatively different. To examine whether the H2O2-induced modification is ubiquitination, RNAPII was immunoprecipitated from extracts of untreated and H2O2-treated cells and immunoblotted with an anti-ubiquitin antibody that recognizes multi-ubiquitin chains. To avoid inclusion of irrelevant ubiquitinated proteins in the samples, we used HF3 cells, HeLa-derivative cells that constitutively express His- and FLAG-tagged Rpb3 (20Hasegawa J. Endou M. Narita T. Yamada T. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and purified tagged RNAPII complex by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography. As shown by silver staining (Fig. 1B, left side), RNAPII subunits and some impurities were found in the HF3 eluate fractions. As shown by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B, right side), ubiquitinated proteins were present only in the H2O2-treated HF3 samples. Because the anti-ubiquitin antibody did not react with the negative control samples that contained the same impurities, ubiquitination likely occurred to RNAPII subunits. Smeared bands of >250 kDa, which are similar in size to the H2O2-induced H14-reactive bands, may correspond to ubiquitinated Rpb1 (Fig. 1B, right side). Smeared bands of ∼160 kDa may be because of ubiquitination of other RNAPII subunits. To obtain direct evidence for Rpb1 ubiquitination, ubiquitinated proteins were affinity-purified from untreated and H2O2-treated cell extracts using a GST fusion protein containing the ubiquitin-associated domains of Rad23 as a ligand. Rad23 strongly binds to ubiquitin through the conserved ubiquitin-associated domains (22Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, the H2O2-induced H14-reactive species were highly concentrated by the affinity matrices, whereas the unmodified IIo form was washed off. These results prove the specificity of the procedure and demonstrate that the novel species of Rpb1 induced by H2O2 are ubiquitinated. Rapid Proteasomal Degradation of Rpb1 after H2O2 Treatment—According to recent reports (17Luo Z. Zheng J. Lu Y. Bregman D.B. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), UV-induced ubiquitination of Rpb1 leads to its rapid proteasomal degradation. We therefore examined whether H2O2-induced ubiquitination of Rpb1 also causes its degradation. Subsequent to H2O2 treatment, the protein level of Rpb1 was monitored in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide with or without the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. As shown by immunoblot analysis using antibody N20 that reacts with total Rpb1, no significant change was observed in the protein levels of the IIo form and the unphosphorylated IIa form during the 4 h after cycloheximide addition (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–8). Over the same period, however, the protein levels of the Ser-5-phosphorylated IIo form and the ubiquitinated form markedly decreased in the absence of MG132 (lanes 1–4). The protein levels of these forms remained unchanged in the presence of MG132 (lanes 5–8). These results suggest that subsequent to H2O2 treatment, the Ser-5-phosphorylated form, but not the Ser-2-phosphorylated form or the unphosphorylated form, is targeted for rapid proteasomal degradation through its ubiquitination. H2O2-induced Ubiquitination of Rpb1 Depends on Its Ser-5 Phosphorylation by ERK1/2—Next we analyzed a role for RNA-PII phosphorylation in the H2O2-induced ubiquitination. Four protein kinase inhibitors, DRB (P-TEFb inhibitor), U0126 (MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 inhibitor), SB203580 (MAPK p38 inhibitor), and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) were added to HeLa cells 30 min prior to UV irradiation or H2O2 treatment and left in culture during a 1-h recovery incubation (Fig. 2A, upper panels). Total ERK serves as a loading control. Under normal growth conditions, Ser-2 phosphorylation, detected by the monoclonal antibody H5, was strongly inhibited by DRB, whereas Ser-5 phosphorylation was affected by none of the inhibitors tested (lanes 1–5). These results are consistent with earlier observations that P-TEFb and TFIIH are major Ser-2 and -5 kinases, respectively (3Oelgeschlager T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Trigon S. Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Jackson S.P. Morange M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6769-6775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Ramanathan Y. Rajpara S.M. Reza S.M. Lees E. Shuman S. Mathews M.B. Pe'ery T. J. Biol.

TFIIH kinase is not sensitive to DRB at a concentration used here. UV irradiation and H2O2 treatment remarkably change protein kinases phosphorylating Ser-2 and -5 without significantly affecting the overall phosphorylation level of Rpb1. After UV irradiation, Ser-2 and -5 phosphorylation was sensitive to both DRB and SP600125 (Fig. 2A, lanes 6–10). After H2O2 treatment, Ser-2 phosphorylation was relatively insensitive to any of the inhibitors tested, whereas Ser-5 phosphorylation was highly sensitive to U0126 (lanes 11–15). Thus, the following conclusions are drawn (Fig. 2C). First, UV irradiation somehow broadens the substrate specificity of P-TEFb, allowing it to phosphorylate not only Ser-2 but also Ser-5 of the CTD. Second, UV irradiation reveals a previously undescribed role of JNK as a CTD kinase. Third, H2O2 treatment causes a situation whereby Ser-5 phosphorylation is highly dependent on the MEK1/2 pathway. Given the several reports (9Trigon S. Serizawa H. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Jackson S.P. Morange M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6769-6775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Markowitz R.B. Hermann A.S. Taylor D.F. He L. Anthony-Cahill S. Ahn N.G. Dynan W.S. Biochem. Biophys.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4399-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) showing that ERK1/2, related MAPKs activated by MEK1/2, act as CTD kinases, we tentatively conclude that ERK1/2 are major Ser-5 kinases after H2O2 treatment. We looked at activation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway after UV irradiation or H2O2 treatment using an antibody against phospho-ERK1/2. ERK1/2 were transiently activated immediately after either stimulation, which precedes RNAPII ubiquitination (Fig. 1A). As anticipated, ERK1/2 activation was suppressed by U0126 but not by the other kinase inhibitors tested (Fig. 2A, lower panels). Thus, ERK1/2 act as major Ser-5 kinases only after H2O2 treatment, although they are activated by both UV irradiation and H2O2. The appearance of ubiquitinated Rpb1 is correlated well with the appearance of Ser-5-phosphorylated Rpb1. The UV-induced ubiquitination was suppressed by DRB and SP600125 (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 10), whereas the H2O2-induced ubiquitination was suppressed by U0126 (Fig. 2, A, lane 13, and B). These results indicate that Ser-5 phosphorylation by ERK1/2 is important for H2O2-induced ubiquitination of Rpb1. Distinct Factor Requirements for UV- and H2O2-induced Ubiquitination of Rpb1—The results so far have established that UV- and H2O2-induced ubiquitinations of Rpb1 are mechanistically different. To extend this point further, we examined whether the H2O2-induced ubiquitination occurs in CSA-, CSB-, and VHL-deficient cells. According to a previous report (4Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), CSA, CSB, and some other DNA repair factors are required for UV-induced ubiquitination of Rpb1. In addition, a recent paper (15Kuznetsova A.V. Meller J. Schnell P.O. Nash J.A. Ignacak M.L. Sanchez Y. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2706-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) has described that pVHL, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is responsible for the UV-induced ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 3A, CSA- and CSB-deficient cells supported H2O2-induced Rpb1 ubiquitination as wild-type cells, whereas the mutant cells were unable to induce Rpb1 ubiquitination in response to UV irradiation. Similarly, the H2O2-induced ubiquitination occurred in VHL-deficient cells as in wild-type cells (Fig. 3B). Therefore, CSA, CSB, and pVHL are all dispensable for H2O2-induced ubiquitination of Rpb1. H2O2-induced Ubiquitination Occurs on Transcriptionally Engaged RNAPII—We next investigated whether H2O2-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination occur on transcriptionally engaged RNAPII. Transcriptionally engaged RNAPII is predominantly in the IIo form and usually resistant to various extraction procedures (21Kamiuchi S. Saijo M. Citterio E. de Jager M. Hoeijmakers J.H. Tanaka K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Conversely, much of the non-extractable IIo form is considered to be transcriptionally engaged. First, we compared subnuclear localization of the Ser-2- and Ser-5-phosphorylated IIo forms of RNAPII before and after H2O2 treatment by immunofluorescence microscopy. The antibodies H5 and H14 both stain fine dots in the non-nucleolar portion of the nucleus (Fig. 4A), which significantly overlap with the sites of active transcription (25Zeng C. Kim E. Warren S.L. Berget S.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, the distribution of RNAPII did not change substantially after H2O2 treatment. Consistent with the above results, however, the H14 staining was sensitive to prior addition of U0126 (compare g with h), suggesting that ERK1/2 are responsible for Ser-5 phosphorylation after the H2O2 treatment. Second, the extractability of RNAPII was compared before and after H2O2 treatment by biochemical fractionation (Fig. 4B). Cells were initially lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 to release cytoplasmic proteins and soluble nuclear proteins. After centrifugation, the supernatant (S1) was found to contain cytoplasmic α-tubulin, much of the transcriptional regulator C/EBPβ, and ∼30% of RNAPII, which is probably not engaged in transcription. Then the pellet was treated with DNase I to solubilize chromatin proteins. After centrifugation, the supernatant (S2) contained the rest of C/EBPβ but no RNAPII. RNAPII was partially released at the next NaCl extraction step (S3), but a significant fraction of RNAPII remained in pellet (P) where most of Lamin A/C and structural components of the nuclear matrix were found. For H2O2-treated cells, ubiquitinated Rpb1 was found in the S3 and P fractions (lanes 7 and 8). Moreover, the IIo form in these fractions was sensitive to U0126 (data not shown). These results indicate that H2O2-induced, ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Rpb1 occur on transcriptionally engaged RNAPII. U0126 Selectively Enhances H2O2-induced Cell Death—If H2O2-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Rpb1 are physiologically relevant, blocking this pathway should affect cell survival post-H2O2 treatment, and it did (Fig. 5). U0126 or dimethyl sulfoxide carrier was added to HeLa cells 30 min prior to UV irradiation or H2O2 treatment and left in the culture until the cells were harvested 24 h after stimulation. Cell viability was quantified by cell counting (data not shown) and by a soluble tetrazolium/formazan assay (Fig. 5), which gave identical results. Under our conditions, U0126 alone showed no toxic effect on HeLa cell growth. H2O2 treatment caused cell death to some extent, and the presence of U0126 remarkably enhanced H2O2-induced cell death (Fig. 5A). UV irradiation also caused cell death in a dose-dependent manner, but U0126 did not enhance UV-induced cell death over the wide range of UV doses (Fig. 5). The same was true when U0126 was removed 2 h poststimulation (data not shown) when the stress-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Rpb1 would have completed without U0126 (Fig. 1A). Thus, the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway plays an important role within the short time window when early cellular responses to oxidative stress including TCR occur. These results do not prove, but support, the idea that H2O2-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Rpb1 are critical for cell survival. UV irradiation and H2O2 are DNA-damaging agents causing different types of DNA lesions. Here we showed that when cells are exposed to H2O2, RNAPII undergoes rapid ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Both UV irradiation and H2O2 cause transient ubiquitination of Rpb1 with a peak at 1 h poststimulation (Fig. 1). Despite the apparent similarity, UV- and H2O2-induced ubiquitinations of Rpb1 proceed via distinct pathways. First, the H2O2-induced ubiquitination involves ERK1/2, whereas the UV-induced ubiquitination involves P-TEFb and JNK (Fig. 2). Second, the H2O2-induced ubiquitination does not involve CSA, CSB, and pVHL, which are all required for the UV-induced ubiquitination (Fig. 3). Third, the band pattern of the H2O2-induced ubiquitination is quite different from that of the UV-induced ubiquitination (Fig. 1). Dynamic Change of Protein Kinases Responsible for CTD Phosphorylation—We showed that protein kinases phosphorylating the CTD change remarkably upon UV irradiation or H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2). The “replacement” of the responsible kinases should occur through activation of unusual CTD kinases accompanied by inactivation of normal CTD kinases or activation of CTD phosphatases. Surprisingly, P-TEFb is responsible for phosphorylation of not only Ser-2 but also Ser-5 following UV irradiation (Fig. 2). This probably relates to the previous finding (26Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A. Bensaude O. Nature. 2001; 414: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) that P-TEFb is activated upon UV irradiation. Under uninduced conditions, a large proportion of P-TEFb in cells forms a catalytically inactive complex with 7SK RNA and MAQ1/HEXIM1 protein (27Michels A.A. Nguyen V.T. Fraldi A. Labas V. Edwards M. Bonnet F. Lania L. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4859-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This complex is dissociated upon several stimuli including UV irradiation, increasing the intracellular level of P-TEFb kinase activity. By contrast, ERK1/2 seem to be responsible for Ser-5 phosphorylation following H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2). The MAPKs ERK1/2 normally exist in an unphosphorylated inactive form in the cytoplasm (28Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Upon introducing several stimuli, including H2O2, ERK1/2 are phosphorylated at Thr-202 and Tyr-204 by the MAPKKs MEK1/2 and translocated into the nucleus, where they phosphorylate the CTD. Nuclear localization of ERK1/2, however, does not suffice for CTD phosphorylation as illustrated by the fact that ERK1/2 do not work as CTD kinases after UV irradiation when ERK1/2 are activated and translocated into the nucleus equally well (Ref. 28Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, see also Fig. 1). The normal CTD kinase TFIIH is believed to phosphorylate Ser-5 concomitant with transcription initiation. UV irradiation and H2O2 treatment probably inhibit both initiation and elongation of transcription and thereby prevent the initiation-associated Ser-5 phosphorylation by TFIIH. According to previous reports (13Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 29Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation status of the CTD is dynamically regulated during transcription elongation. Perhaps, RNAPII stalled at a DNA lesion is susceptible to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on the CTD, and its phosphorylation status is determined by the opposing actions of the unusual CTD kinases described above and Fcp1 phosphatase. A Possible Role of H2O2-induced Rpb1 Ubiquitination in Transcription-coupled BER—We propose a model that H2O2-induced Rpb1 ubiquitination is involved in transcription-coupled BER. Once thought of as a subpathway of NER, it is now clear that TCR also exists in BER (18Le Page F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 30Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 induce non-bulky, non-helix-distorting DNA lesions such as 8-oxoguanine and thymine glycol that are mainly corrected by the BER pathway, whereas UV irradiation induces bulky helix-distorting DNA lesions such as the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer and (6–4) photoproduct that are corrected by the NER pathway. As expected from the presence of transcription-coupled BER, oxidative DNA damages in the coding region are repaired considerably faster than those in the genome overall. Contrary to a classic view, we and others (18Le Page F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 31Tornaletti S. Maeda L.S. Lloyd D.R. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7294-7299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have shown recently that some of the H2O2-induced DNA lesions cause RNAPII stalling in vivo and in vitro similar to the UV-induced DNA lesions. The data presented here suggest that such stalled polymerases are recognized and ubiquitinated differentially depending on the types of DNA lesions. It is reported that transcriptional arrest caused by the transcriptional inhibitor α-amanitin or by nucleotide starvation, free of any DNA damage, leads to Rpb1 ubiquitination in vitro (6Lee K.B. Wang D. Lippard S.J. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4239-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 33Yang L.Y. Jiang H. Rangel K.M. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 683-689PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in vivo, UV- or H2O2-induced arrest of elongating RNA-PII may be the direct cause of Rpb1 ubiquitination. This view may be too simplistic, however, considering the qualitative difference of the UV- and H2O2-induced ubiquitination. Ubiquitination of Rpb1 may enhance the TCR process by causing its proteasomal degradation and permitting access of the repair machinery to damaged sites. The differential ubiquitination may even serve as a switch between BER and NER by selectively recruiting repair factors of either pathway to damaged sites. Consistent with these scenarios, H2O2-induced ubiquitination and degradation of Rpb1 occur on transcriptionally engaged RNAPII (Fig. 4) concomitant with the progress of TCR (30Cooper P.K. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.A. Science. 1997; 275: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and inhibition of this process confers a H2O2-sensitive phenotype (Fig. 5) indicative of a TCR defect (34Unk I. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1656-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Not much is known about the factors and mechanisms involved in transcription-coupled BER. It is likely, however, that some protein factors including XPG and CSB, previously thought to be involved in NER, participate in transcription-coupled BER (18Le Page F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the roles played by these common factors seem different between the pathways. XPG, an endonuclease cutting on the 3′-side of a DNA lesion during NER, functions independently of this activity during BER (35Klungland A. Hoss M. Gunz D. Constantinou A. Clarkson S.G. Doetsch P.W. Bolton P.H. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We showed here that CSA and CSB are essential for UV-induced ubiquitination but not for H2O2-induced ubiquitination of Rpb1. The differential requirement for CSA and CSB may indicate their different roles in NER and BER. We thank Noriaki Shimizu and Hirotoshi Tanaka for 786-O cells.

Post-translational modifications expand the cellular repertoire of proteins far beyond the possibilities offered by the 20 encoded amino acids, constituting one of the most exciting frontiers in modern biology. A little more than a dozen post-translational protein side-chain modifications have been identified so far. Protein methylation occurs ubiquitously in nature, in bacteria, archaea, and eucarya, involving the amino groups of such residues as arginine, lysine, histidine, alanine, proline, and glutamine and hydroxyl groups of glutamic and aspartic acid (1Paik W.K. Kim S. Yonsei Med. J. 1986; 27: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Methylated amino acids occur in highly specialized proteins, exerting diverse functional and structural roles, such as histones, flagellar proteins, myosin, actin, ribosomal proteins, opsin, EF-1α, HnPNP protein, HMG-1 and -2 proteins, fungal and plant cytochrome c, myelin basic protein, EF-Tu, heat shock proteins, calmodulin, etc. (1Paik W.K. Kim S. Yonsei Med. J. 1986; 27: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The effects of methylation on the recruitment of heterochromatin proteins to specific histones in nucleosome cores and the subsequent effects on gene expression have been documented in detail (2Dillon N.

It was reported that methylation of the histone H3 tail is an epigenetic mark, affecting acetylation and phosphorylation of histone tail residues in mammals and Drosophila (3Rea S. Eisenhaber F.

In addition, histone methylation affected DNA methylation in the heterochromatin of Neurospora crassa (8Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Nature. 2001; 414: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The essential role of lysine methylation was demonstrated also in rat ribosomal proteins (9Williamson N.A. Raliegh J. Morrice N.A. Wettenhall R.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and in the pathogenesis of late infantile ceroid lipofuscinosis (10Katz M.L. Siakotos A.N. Gao Q. Freiha B. Chin D.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A recent observation of high medical interest concerns the inhibition of toxicity of the synthetic β-amyloid peptide β-(25–35) by N-methylation (11Hughes E. Burke R.M. Doig A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25109-25115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The presence of methylated lysyl residues has also been reported for proteins from thermophilic microorganisms, such as ferredoxin from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (12Minami Y. Wakabayashi S. Wada K. Matsubara H. Kerscher L. Oesterhelt D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and a number of proteins from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (13Ammendola B. Raia C.A. Caruso C. Camardella L. D'Auria S. De Rosa M. Rossi M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12514-12523Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14Maras B. Consalvi V. Chiaraluce R. Politi L. De Rosa M. Bossa F.

Biochem. 1994; 222: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this regard, it has been shown that the rate constant of thermoin-activation of an enzyme is an inverse function of the number of modified ∈-amino groups (16Torchilin V.P. Maksimenko A.V. Smirnov V.N. Klibanov A.M. Martinek K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 567: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, no systematic study of the effect and nature of N-∈-methylation on the structural and catalytic properties of thermophilic enzymes has been carried out. β-Glycosidase from S. solfataricus (Ssβgly) 1The abbreviations used are: Ssβgly, S. solfataricus β-glycosidase; EcSsβgly, S. solfataricus β-glycosidase recombinantly expressed in E. coli; SsADH, S. solfataricus alcohol dehydrogenase; FT-IR, Fourier transform infrared; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ES-MS, electrospray mass spectrometry; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; amide I′, amide I band in a [2H]2O medium; ES, electrospray; MS, mass spectrometry. has been recently subjected to a detailed analysis of the structural determinants of protein stability, prompted by its peculiar behavior in the presence of SDS (17Gentile F. Amodeo P. Febbraio F. Picaro F. Motta A. Formisano S. Nucci R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44050-44060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This protein may also be adequate as a model for investigating the structural and functional consequences of N-∈-methylation of lysyl residues in archaea. In the present study, a detailed structural characterization of the native, methylated Ssβgly and the unmethylated enzyme, recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli (EcSsβgly) (18Moracci M. Nucci R. Febbraio F. Vaccaro C. Vespa N. La Cara F. Rossi M. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1995; 17: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), was carried out. In order to discriminate between the different behaviors of the methylated and unmethylated forms of the protein, their thermal denaturation was investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and turbidimetry. The effects of methylation on protein stability in SDS were also investigated. Methylated residues were localized within the sequence by mass spectrometry. Moreover, the localization of methylation sites was analyzed in relation with neighboring elements of secondary structure and with the overall topology of the enzyme and also in relation with the pattern of sequence conservation between Ssβgly and other mesophilic β-glucosidases belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family I. Materials—S. solfataricus strain MT4, isolated from acidic hot springs at Pozzuoli (Naples), was grown aerobically at 87 °C and pH 3.0 in a 100-liter fermenter, as previously described (19Cacace M.G. De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Homogeneous Ssβgly (20Nucci R. Moracci M. Vaccaro C. Vespa N. Rossi M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1993; 17: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar) and EcSsβgly (18Moracci M. Nucci R. Febbraio F. Vaccaro C. Vespa N. La Cara F. Rossi M. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1995; 17: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were purified as described. Cyanogen bromide was purchased from Pierce. Trypsin was from Sigma, and endoproteases Glu-C, Asp-N, and Lys-C were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Deuterium oxide (99.9%, [2H]2O) was purchased from Aldrich. All other reagents and solvents were of the highest purity. The high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems were from Hewlett Packard and Waters. The Nile Red and the standard of N-∈-methyl-l-lysine were from Sigma. The AccQ·Tag kit for amino acid analysis was from Waters. Amino Acid Composition Analysis—Aliquots of homogeneous samples of Ssβgly were desalted by reverse phase HPLC on a Sephasil C4 (5-μm) column and lyophilized in pyrolyzed glass tubes at 500 °C. Amino acid composition was determined on samples hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl at 153 °C for 1 h in sealed vials under vacuum. The sample was lyophilized and suspended in 20 mm HCl and derivatized using the AccQ·Fluor reagent kit (Waters), as described in the AccQ·Tag Method (Waters). Aliquots of derivatized samples were injected in a Breeze HPLC system (Waters) on an AccQ·Tag amino acid analysis (high efficiency Nova-Pak™ C18; 4 μm) column (Waters), specifically certified for use with the AccQ·Tag method. The elution gradient in the AccQ·Tag Method was slightly modified in order to separate peaks of derivatized standards of l-leucine (retention time 33.3 min) and N-∈-methyl-l-lysine (retention time 33.6 min). Preparation of Samples for Infrared Measurements—Typically, 1–1.5 mg of homogeneous native or recombinant protein, dissolved in the buffer used for their purification (20Nucci R. Moracci M. Vaccaro C. Vespa N. Rossi M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1993; 17: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar), were centrifuged in 30K centricon microconcentrators (Amicon) at 3000 × g and 4 °C and concentrated to a volume of ∼40 μl. Then 300 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer, p2H 7.0, in [2H]2O, were added, and the samples were concentrated again. The p2H value corresponds to the pH meter reading + 0.4 (21Salomaa P. Schaleger L.L. Long F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1-7Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This procedure was repeated several times in order to replace completely the original buffer with the phosphate buffer. In the last washing, the protein samples were concentrated to a final volume of 40 μl and used for the infrared measurements. The time of contact of the proteins with the [2H]2O medium prior to FT-IR analysis was about 24 h. At least three different measurements were carried out on different samples of each protein. Infrared Spectra—The concentrated homogeneous protein samples were placed in a thermostatted Graseby Specac 20500 cell (Graseby-Specac Ltd., Orpington, Kent, UK) fitted with CaF2 windows and 25-μm Teflon spacers. FT-IR spectra were recorded by means of a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 1760-x Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, using a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector and a normal Beer-Norton apodization function. At least 24 h before and during data acquisition, the spectrometer was continuously purged with dry air at a dew point of –40 °C. Spectra of buffers and samples were acquired at 2-cm–1 resolution, under the same scanning and temperature conditions. Typically, 256 scans were averaged for each spectrum obtained at 20 °C, whereas 32 scans were averaged for spectra obtained at higher temperatures. In the thermal denaturation experiments, the temperature was raised by 5 ± 0.1 °C steps from 20 to 95 °C. Before acquiring spectra, samples were maintained at the desired temperature for the time necessary for the stabilization of temperature inside the cell (6 min). Spectra were collected and processed using the Spectrum software from PerkinElmer. The deconvoluted parameters for the amide I band were set with a γ value of 2.5 and a smoothing length of 60. Turbidimetric Measurements—Samples containing 250 μg/ml homogeneous Ssβgly or EcSsβgly in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were filtered on 0.22-μm sterile filters (Millipore Corp.). Absorbances were recorded in a 1-cm light path quartz cuvette, at a wavelength of 600 nm, using a spectrophotometer Cary 1E thermostatted with a Cary temperature controller accessory, equipped with a Peltier’s heat exchange device positioned around the sample, with an error of 0.1 °C. The temperature was increased from 50 to 95 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min, and the increase in absorbance at 600 nm was recorded. At least three different measurements were carried out on different samples and at different concentrations. Thermal Stability Measurements—The thermal stability of Ssβgly and EcSsβgly was measured by incubating a 0.41 μm concentration of the homogeneous enzyme in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at 85 °C in a thermostatted water bath. At time intervals, aliquots containing 4.1 pmol of the enzyme were withdrawn from the incubation mixture and assayed at 75 °C under the conditions described (20Nucci R. Moracci M. Vaccaro C. Vespa N. Rossi M. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1993; 17: 239-250PubMed Google Scholar). Nile Red Fluorescence—All analyses were performed with a Jasco FP777 spectrofluorimeter, thermostatted at room temperature, using cells with a working volume of 500 μl and a path length of 10 mm. The excitation wavelength was set at 550 nm, and excitation and emission slits were set at 5 and 10 nm, respectively. Nile Red (0.25 mm in Me2SO) was added in the cuvette containing homogeneous samples of 0.41 μm Ssβgly or EcSsβgly, up to a final concentration of 1 μm, and spectra were recorded after 15 min. In a hydrophobic environment, a blue shift in the maximum emission wavelength (about 665 nm in water) and an increase in the fluorescence intensity of Nile Red are observed. Preparation of Linear Transverse Gradient Polyacrylamide Gels— The preparation of linear transverse-gradient polyacrylamide gels was described in detail (17Gentile F. Amodeo P. Febbraio F. Picaro F. Motta A. Formisano S. Nucci R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44050-44060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Linear transverse gradient gels were used, containing 4–9% total acrylamide from left to right, 2.7% N,N′-methylene bis-acrylamide, in 0.375 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1% SDS, polymerized on a sheet of GelBond-PAG (Bio-Whittaker). No stacking gel was used, but a sample gel containing 3.75% total acrylamide in electrode buffer was created on top of the gel. Reference standards and Ssβgly or EcSsβgly were subjected to electrophoresis all together in alternate lanes of 20-lane gels. The electrode buffer contained 0.025 m Tris base, 0.19 m glycine, pH 8.2, 0.1% SDS. The enzymes were dissolved in 0.01 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, 1.36 m glycerol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue as tracking dye. SDS electrophoresis was conducted at 15 °C at 10 mA, until the dye front reached the lower end on the left side of the gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Molecular Mass Estimation by Ferguson Analysis of Linear Transverse Gradient Polyacrylamide Gels—The molecular mass of Ssβgly and EcSsβgly was determined as described (17Gentile F. Amodeo P. Febbraio F. Picaro F. Motta A. Formisano S. Nucci R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44050-44060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), by indirect comparison of the relative mobilities (Rm) of the enzyme and those of calibration proteins, after electrophoresis in a linear transverse gradient polyacrylamide gel. A detailed description of the method was reported (17Gentile F. Amodeo P. Febbraio F. Picaro F. Motta A. Formisano S. Nucci R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44050-44060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Chemical and Enzymatic Hydrolyses—Homogeneous β-glycosidase samples were digested by CNBr in 70% trifluoroacetic acid, at room temperature, for 18 h in the dark. Samples were diluted with 4 volumes of distilled H2O and lyophilized. CNBr fragments were purified by HPLC on a Vydac C4 column (25 × 0.46 cm; 5 μm), using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in 95% acetonitrile (solvent B), by means of a two-step gradient. The column was equilibrated at 20% of solvent B for 5 min, and then the acetonitrile concentration was raised from 20 to 35% in 15 min and from 35 to 60% in 33 min. The elution was monitored at 220 and 280 nm. Selected CNBr peptides from Ssβgly were subdigested overnight at 37 °C with endoproteinase Asp-N in 0.4% ammonium bicarbonate containing 10% acetonitrile, pH 8.5, using an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w). Subdigestion of the peptide mixtures by endoproteinase Glu-C, trypsin, or endoproteinase Lys-C was carried out in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, for 18 h at 37 °C, using an enzyme-tosubstrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Under the alkaline conditions used for the enzymatic digestions, the C-terminal lactone of each CNBr fragment was hydrolyzed to free homoserine. Samples were then lyophilized twice prior to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Mass Spectrometry—Intact homogeneous proteins or individual peptide fractions were submitted to electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS), using a BIO-Q triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass). Samples were dissolved in 1% acetic acid in 50% acetonitrile, and 2–10 μl were injected into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The quadrupole was scanned from m/z 600 to 1800 at 10 s/scan, and the spectra were acquired and elaborated using the MassLynx software (Micromass). Calibration was performed with the multiply charged ions from a separate injection of myoglobin (Mr = 16,951.5). All mass values are reported as average masses. MALDI mass spectra were recorded using a Voyager DE MALDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). A mixture of analyte solution, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, and bovine insulin was applied to the sample plate and air-dried. Mass calibration was performed using the molecular ions from bovine insulin at 5734.6 and a matrix peak at 379.1 as internal standards. Raw data were analyzed with a computer software provided by the manufacturer and were reported as average masses. Computational Analysis—All structure calculations were performed on a SGI IRIS O2 R10000 computer. Our simulations were based on the crystal structure of Ssβgly refined at 2.6 Å (Protein Data Bank entry 1GOW) (22Aguilar C.F. Sanderson I. Moracci M. Ciaramella M. Nucci R. Rossi M. Pearl L.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Lysines 116, 135, 273, 311, and 332 were modified, using the Biopolymer module implemented in InsightII 98.0 (Biosym/MSI) (23Biosym/MSI InsightII User Guide. Biosym/MSI, San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar), by the addition of a methyl group, from the InsightII library, to the side chain N∈ atom. In the same module, hydrogen atoms were added to the methylated and unmethylated protein structures at pH 7.0. The cvff force field was applied to the two structures, and the resulting protonated state of the modified and unmodified protein gave a total charge of –36. The positions of the side chains were optimized by subsequent molecular mechanics calculations, using the Discover 3 module implemented in InsightII 98.0 (Biosym/MSI) (23Biosym/MSI InsightII User Guide. Biosym/MSI, San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar). For the minimization process, a conjugate gradient was applied after 50 steps of steepest descent algorithm. After minimization, the differences in the N-∈-methyl-lysine area were analyzed by the Viewer module of InsightII 98.0. The exposed solvent surfaces of the modified and unmodified proteins were calculated using the Molmol program, release 2.5 (24Koradi R. Billeter M. Wûthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar), with a standard radius of 1.4 Å.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Structure comparisons between Ssβgly (Protein Data Bank accession number 1GOW) (22Aguilar C.F. Sanderson I.

Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). The analysis of Ssβgly and SsADH structural topology was obtained using the TOPS (topology of protein structure) software available on the World Wide Web at www.tops.leeds.ac.uk/ (30Westhead D.R. Slidel T.W.F. Flores T.P.J. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Organism and Growth—Sulfolobus solfataricus strain MT-4, isolated from acidic hot springs at Pozzuoli (Naples), was grown in vitro in a 100-liter fermenter (19Cacace M.G. De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), in strict accordance with the optimal conditions described for growth in vivo (i.e. at 87 °C and pH 3.0, in aerobiosis) (31De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Nicolaus B. Buonocore V. Poerio E. Biotechnol. Lett. 1980; 2: 29-34Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The yield of bacterial biomass was about 240–280 g per 100 liters of culture broth. Amino Acid Composition Analysis—Several aliquots of homogeneous Ssβgly from different growth cycles of S. solfataricus were analyzed for their amino acid composition. The relative content of methylated lysines resulting from the analyses was between 14 and 17% (data not shown). Considering that 5 lysines of 23 (21.7%) were methylated (see below), these results indicated a constantly substoichiometric level of modification in the in vitro culture. FT-IR Spectroscopy—In the FT-IR deconvolution spectra of Ssβgly and EcSsβgly at p2H 7.0, the amide I′ bands (1700–1600-cm–1 region) of the two β-glycosidase forms were almost indistinguishable, which indicates nearly identical secondary structure contents for the two forms of the protein. Only small differences were noticed, by monitoring the amide I′ bandwidth as a function of the temperature (32Skorko-Glonek J. Lipinska B. Krzewski K. Zolese G. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8974-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Fernandez-Ballester G. Castresana J. Arrondo J.L.R. Ferragut L.A. Gonzales-Ros J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) at p2H 7.0, in order to determine the thermal denaturation curves of the two forms of the protein (data not shown). Since this method did not appear to be sufficiently sensitive to detect subtle changes in the secondary structure, a more detailed investigation of protein thermal denaturation was performed by difference spectroscopy (32Skorko-Glonek J. Lipinska B. Krzewski K. Zolese G. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8974-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34Banecki B. Zylicz M. Bertoli E.

Biochem. 1993; 218: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Difference spectra were derived from the series of spectra recorded at stepwise increasing temperatures, by subtracting each one of them from the spectrum recorded at the next higher temperature. For example, the 95–90 °C difference spectrum corresponded to the spectrum recorded at 95 °C, after subtraction of the one recorded at 90 °C. In these spectra, a negative band indicated a lower content of a particular secondary structural element in the spectrum recorded at higher temperature and vice versa (Fig. 1, A and B). Hence, the negative broad band between 1600 and 1700 cm–1 corresponded to the loss of secondary structure in the sample recorded at higher temperature (34Banecki B. Zylicz M. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25051-25058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the two positive peaks close to 1617 and 1685 cm–1 represented protein aggregation brought about by thermal denaturation (34Banecki B. Zylicz M. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25051-25058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The negative band close to 1540 cm–1 mainly represented an enhanced 1H/2H exchange, caused by the increase of temperature and by protein unfolding (36Osborne H.B. Nabedryk-Viala E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 88: 676-680Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The difference spectra of native and recombinant proteins, shown in Fig. 1, A and B, indicated the onset of protein denaturation and aggregation. In particular, the small negative band at 1657.2 cm–1 represented a partial loss of α-helices in the samples assayed at higher temperature, whereas the positive peak close to 1617 cm–1 reflected protein aggregation. From these spectra, it appears that protein aggregation paralleled protein denaturation. The amplitudes of the negative and positive bands in the 94.2–89.0 °C difference spectrum of Ssβgly were smaller than those present in the corresponding difference spectrum of EcSsβgly. Moreover, the Tm was observed in the 99.0–98.1 °C spectrum for native Ssβgly and in the 98.1–97.2 °C spectrum for EcSsβgly (Fig. 1, A and B). When the normalized absorbance values of the broad negative band between 1600 and 1700 cm–1 and of the positive peak close to 1617 cm–1, reflecting denatu"
https://openalex.org/W2020703342,"HSP25 is a member of the small heat shock protein family. This 25-kDa protein exhibits a highly specific distribution during mouse embryonic development. Although multiple functions have been proposed for HSP25, the role it plays during differentiation is still unknown. High levels of HSP25 can be detected in embryonic and adult skin. During epidermis differentiation, the concentration of HSP25 increases with the distance of keratinocytes from the basal layer, in parallel with the extent of keratinization. We used an ex vivo cellular system, PAM212 cells, to analyze quantitatively and qualitatively the dynamics of HSP25 production and phosphorylation during the differentiation of keratinocytes. Our observations suggest that HSP25 is involved in two steps of PAM212 keratinocyte differentiation. Shortly after the induction of differentiation, a transient hyperphosphorylation of HSP25 seems to be essential for the expression of differentiation markers. Later, the chaperone-active form of HSP25 is organized progressively into characteristic aggregates involved in the dynamics of keratin filament networks.

HSP25 (called HSP27 in human cells) belongs to the small heat shock protein (HSP) 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKAP, MAP kinase-activated protein; MEK, MAP/ERK kinase; MEKK, MEK kinase; MK, mouse keratin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. family. All members of this family are small (20–30 kDa) and contain a highly conserved carboxyl-terminal region, called the α-crystallin domain (1Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Potter R. Stein G. Stein J.

Its synthesis is strongly up-regulated in response to heat and chemical and oxidative stresses. Two residues from HSP25 can be phosphorylated via the p38 MAP kinase pathway: Ser-15 and Ser-86. p38 phosphorylates MAPKAP kinase 2/3 which in turn phosphorylates HSP25 (2Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). αA- and αB-crystallin were initially described as eye lens structural proteins. However, αB-crystallin has a function and sequence similar to those of HSP25. It can be induced by heat and chemical and oxidative stresses. These proteins are well known chaperones (3Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ehrnsperger M. Gaestel M. Buchner J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 421-429PubMed Google Scholar), although no substrate specificity has been described so far. During embryonic development, HSP25 appears to be strongly produced in specific organs or tissues such as heart, skeletal muscles, smooth muscles, epidermis, eye lens, cartilage, and bone (5Gernold M.

Immunohistochemical analyses have detected HSP25 in some areas of the developing central nervous system, even though global Western and Northern blotting failed to detect this protein (10Loones M.-T. Chang Y. Morange M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Armstrong C.L. Krueger-Naug A.M. Currie R.W. Hawkes R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 434: 262-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This specific pattern suggests that this small heat shock protein is involved in cell differentiation, which is further supported by the results obtained by a few cellular approaches. The ex vivo differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cells into macrophages or granulocytes is accompanied by the transient phosphorylation of HSP27 and by an increase in the production of the protein and a decrease in proliferation (12Spector N.L. Ryan C. Samson W. Levine H. Nadler L.M. Arrigo A.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Spector N.L. Mehlen P. Ryan C. Hardy L. Samson W. Levine H. Nadler L.M. Fabre N. Arrigo A.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The use of antisense oligonucleotides to reduce the production of HSP27 in HL-60 cells leads to a less pronounced reduction in cell growth after induction with retinoic acid and alters some parameters of granulocytic differentiation (14Chaufour S. Mehlen P. Arrigo A.P. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, HSP25 phosphorylation is not essential for HL-60 cell differentiation (15Schultz H. Rogalla T. Engel K. Lee J.C. Gaestel M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1997; 2: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). During the pluripotent differentiation of embryonic stem cells, HSP27 is dephosphorylated rapidly after induction, which precedes the transient accumulation and oligomerization of the protein. In these cells, the overexpression of HSP27 reduces the rate of cell proliferation, whereas the down-regulation of the protein by stable antisense RNA compromises the differentiation program, causing massive cell apoptosis (16Mehlen P. Mehlen A. Godet J. Arrigo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31657-31665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, HSP27 may act as a switch between differentiation and apoptosis. The ex vivo differentiation of rat olfactory progenitors is accompanied by a transient increase in HSP27 production. A down-regulation of HSP27 leads to the failure of differentiation and a massive commitment to cell death, whereas the overexpression of this protein strongly decreases the proportion of dying cells. Thus, HSP27 is probably a key element in the control of cell death during neuronal differentiation (17Mehlen P. Coronas V. Ljubic-Thibal V. Ducasse C. Granger L. Jourdan F. Arrigo A.P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The production of HSP25 and the activation of p38 MAP kinase are essential for the differentiation of P19 cells into cardiomyocytes. However, the effects of p38 MAP kinase activation seem to be independent of HSP25 accumulation (18Davidson S.M. Morange M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 146-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The overexpression of HSP25 in C1 cells, which are able to differentiate into chondrocytes, showed that elevated HSP25 levels decrease the cellular adhesion of C1 cells and interfere with their differentiation into chondrocytes (19Favet N. Duverger O. Loones M.T. Poliard A. Kellermann O. Morange M. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In vitro studies and cell system analysis suggested several roles for HSP25. HSP25 can interfere with actin polymerization and the stabilization of microfilaments (20Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G.

In this study, we concentrated on the role of HSP25 in the differentiation of mouse epidermis. In the adult mouse, the epidermis consists of several cell layers. The degree of differentiation increases from the basement membrane to the outside of the body: basal layer, spinous layer, granular layer, and the stratum corneum. The cells in the basal layer express mainly mouse keratins 5 (MK5) and 14 (MK14), whereas those in the suprabasal layers (from the spinous layer) express mainly keratins 1 (MK1) and 10 (MK10). HSP27 can be detected in the human epidermis from week 14 of gestation. HSP27 staining increases with the distance of the keratinocytes from the basal layer, in parallel with the extent of keratinization (40Jantschitsch C. Kindas-Mugge I. Metze D. Amann G. Micksche M. Trautinger F. Br. J. Dermatol. 1998; 139: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In normal human skin, HSP27 colocalizes with keratins and other markers of the cornified layer, suggesting that it plays a role in the assembly of keratin filaments (41Jonak C. Klosner G. Kokesch C. Födinger D. Hönigsman H. Trautinger F. Br. J. Dermatol. 2002; 147: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We used PAM212 cells as a model for keratinocyte differentiation. This malignantly transformed mouse cell line can proliferate in a medium with a low calcium concentration, and terminal differentiation of these keratinocytes can be induced by increasing the calcium concentration of the culture medium (42Yuspa S.H. Hawley-Nelson P. Koehler B. Stanley J.R. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 4694-4703PubMed Google Scholar). The overall pattern of keratin synthesis in these cells is similar to that in the newborn epidermis, whereas primary cultures of newborn mouse epidermis fail to produce ex vivo the same keratins (43Roop D.R. Hawley-Nelson P. Cheng C.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1983; 81: 144S-149SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the PAM212 cell line is an appropriate model for studying the role of HSP25 in the differentiation of the epidermis. We show that HSP25 is involved in two stages of PAM212 keratinocyte differentiation. First, a transient accumulation of the phosphorylated form of HSP25 seems to be essential for the induction of differentiation. Second, the nonphosphorylated chaperone-active form of HSP25 contributes to the reorganization of the keratin network by driving the disassembly of the MK5/MK14 network. Cell Culture and Differentiation—PAM212 cells were cultured in tissue culture dishes (Falcon) at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2 water-saturated atmosphere in calcium-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mm CaCl2 (low calcium medium). To carry out terminal differentiation, PAM212 cells were grown until confluence and then incubated in the same medium containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 (high calcium medium). High calcium medium was replaced every day. For p38 inhibition assays, 10 μm SB203580 (Calbiochem) was added to the culture medium. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Protein extracts were prepared by washing cells in 4 °C PBS, scraping into Laemmli sample buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and then heating for 10 min at 95 °C (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and equal amounts of protein were loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15%). Prestained low range SDS-PAGE standards from Bio-Rad were included in each gel. Proteins were transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting was performed using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies were MK1 (Babco), MK10 (Babco), and HSP25 (Stressgen). The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Promega). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Aliquots of protein extracts, containing equivalent amounts of HSP25, saturated with urea, and completed with 2% Nonidet P-40, were separated by isoelectric focusing in 4% acrylamide gels containing 8 m urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.02% Ampholine 3–10, and 0.02% Ampholine 4–6, in glass tubes. The upper tank was filled with 20 mm NaOH and the lower tank with 10 mm phosphoric acid. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis at 800 V overnight. First dimension gels were then removed from the tubes, soaked in Laemmli buffer, laid on the top of a 15% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to second dimension electrophoresis in classical conditions for size separation. Proteins were electrotransferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes. HSP25 was detected by immunoblotting as described above. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were grown and allowed to differentiate on gelatin-coated sterile glass coverslips. Cells at each stage were washed with PBS at 4 °C and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed in PBS and stored at 4 °C in PBS. The cells were subjected to immunocytochemistry in a humid chamber. To permeabilize the cells, coverslips were incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. After blocking in 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h, cells were incubated with primary antibodies in 3% BSA and PBS for 1 h. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS and once in 3% BSA and PBS (5 min), then incubated with secondary antibodies, Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin when necessary (Sigma) for 30 min in the dark. After four washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted on slides with Mowiol, dried overnight, and examined on a Leica DMRB microscope or a Leica TCS/SP2 confocal microscope. The primary antibodies were HSP25 (Stressgen), MK1 (Babco), MK5 (gift from Dr. Oulad, IGBMC, Strasbourg, France), and MK10 (DAKO). The secondary antibodies were Cy®3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson,) and Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Immunohistochemistry—For immunohistochemical analyses embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C. They were embedded in Paraplast® Plus (Sherwood Medical). 10-μm sections cut on a Leica microtome were laid on treated slides (SuperFrost Plus) in water, dried at 37 °C, and stored at 4 °C. Before immunohistochemistry, slides were cleared of Paraplast in two Histo-Clear® (National Diagnostics) baths of 15 min, then gradually rehydrated through an ethanol series and soaked in PBS for 5 min. Immunohistochemistry was performed in a humid chamber. Free aldehydes were saturated with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 30 min. Sections were submerged for 30 min in a blocking solution (3% BSA in PBS), containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for permeabilization. Slides were washed three times for 10 min in 3% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (dilution buffer), then incubated with primary antibodies in dilution buffer for 1 h. After washing three times in dilution buffer, slides were incubated with secondary antibodies in dilution buffer for 30 min. Sections were washed three times in PBS and mounted in Mowiol. Slides were examined on a Leica TCS/SP2 confocal microscope. Each picture was the result of an average performed from a series of 12 scans separated by 0.2 μm. The same antibodies were used as for immunocytochemistry. Electron Microscopy—PAM212 cells grown on Petri dishes were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% tannic acid in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 1 h at pH 7.4, washed in the same buffer, postfixed in 1% OsO4 for 45 min, and dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol including a 30-min treatment in 0.4% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol. Then, a monolayer of EPON™ was deposited on the cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then at 60 °C for 2 days. Thin strip of cells embedded in EPON were cut and embedded in cross-section. Thin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then examined in a Philips Tecnai 12 electron microscope. The Morphology of PAM212 Cells Changes during Terminal Differentiation—PAM212 keratinocytes were cultured in low calcium medium until confluence. On day 0, terminal differentiation was induced by increasing the concentration of calcium in the medium. The morphology of the cells was followed by direct observation in the culture dish. Half-confluent cells, observed 2 days before induction (day –2), were stretched and often exhibited cytoplasmic extensions (Fig. 1A, a). At day 0, PAM212 cells were apposed, but spaces were visible between the cells (Fig. 1A, b). On day 1, the cells were already organized into two layers, but spaces could still be seen between cells (Fig. 1A, c). From day 2 onward, the cells in the upper layer formed a flat surface of tightly sealed cells, making it difficult to localize cell boundaries. Only nuclei were clearly visible at these stages (Fig. 1A, d and e). The stratification of PAM212 cells could easily be visualized after staining with Hoechst. Indeed, at day 0, nuclei were well separated from each other, showing that there is only one layer of cells at this stage (Fig. 1B, a). On day 1, the nuclei density had significantly increased, and some nuclei overlapped each other, demonstrating that cells had begun to form a second layer (Fig. 1B, b). The density of the nuclei continued to increase with time such that three and sometimes four nuclei overlapped, suggesting the presence of at least three cell layers (Fig. 1B, c). Electron microscopy analysis of transverse cell sections on day 4 was consistent with these observations. On day 4, three or four cell layers were visible. The nuclear region appeared to be rather thick, but the cells exhibit very thin cytoplasmic extensions that make them creep between neighboring cells (Fig. 1C). The Production of HSP25 Increases during the Differentiation of PAM212 Cells—We used Western blotting to analyze the expression of specific differentiation markers to confirm the final differentiation of the keratinocytes (Fig. 2). MK1 and MK10 are the two main keratins produced by the suprabasal layers of the epidermis in vivo. In differentiating PAM212 cells, MK1 could be detected as early as day 1 and then increased 2-fold during the following steps. However, MK10 could not be detected before day 2 and increased until day 4. The level of HSP25 changed considerably during the differentiation process (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis detected a low level of HSP25 in proliferating cells cultured in a low calcium medium (days –2 and 0). During differentiation in high calcium medium, the level of HSP25 increased (∼6-fold) until day 3. The amount of HSP25 decreased slightly at day 4. These results confirm that PAM212 cells are a good model for epidermal differentiation and that this system is appropriate for studying the role of HSP25 in the differentiation of keratinocytes. HSP25 Aggregates Progressively during the Differentiation of the Keratinocytes—We used immunocytochemistry to analyze the distribution of HSP25 in PAM212 cells before and during terminal differentiation. Actin filaments were stained in the same experiments to (i) distinguish all the cell layers regardless of whether they contain HSP25; (ii) follow changes in cell morphology; and (iii) look for possible interactions between HSP25 and actin filaments. We found that HSP25 aggregates progressively during the differentiation of PAM212 cells (Fig. 3). At days –2 and 0, before induction, the protein was distributed homogeneously in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, a and d), and the cells (one layer) displayed a typical actin network (Fig. 3, b and e). The patterns of HSP25 and actin did not overlap at these stages (Fig. 3, c and f). From day 1 onward, the cells became stratified, and those in the bottom layer exhibited a bundle of stretched actin filaments crossing the cell in a preferential direction (Fig. 3t). HSP25 was no longer expressed in these cells (Fig. 3s). At day 1, the distribution of actin filaments was very characteristic in the cells in the newly formed upper layer. Indeed, actin formed granular structures, concentrated mainly at the cytoplasm periphery (Fig. 3, h and h′). In these cells, HSP25 had already started to form thin, elongated, tortuous aggregates. These structures were located mainly at the cell periphery and around the nuclei (Fig. 3, g and g′). The HSP25 and actin signals seemed to overlap partially at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, i and i′). At day 2, the actin filaments in upper layer cells were mainly flattened along the cortical cytoplasm, thus revealing the borders between the cells, and granular structures were still found throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3k). These cells were polygonal and tightly adhered to each other, giving the whole surface a paved appearance. This pattern of actin filaments did not change during the following steps of differentiation (Fig. 3, n, q, and q′). At day 2, the aggregated HSP25 began to concentrate in some parts of the cell, but other parts tended to be free of HSP25 (Fig. 3j). Interestingly, high amounts of HSP25 were detected around the nuclei of these cells. At day 3, HSP25 formed large (ø 1–2 μm), very compact aggregates distributed in the whole cytoplasm and in the nuclei (Fig. 3m). At day 4, the aggregates were the same shape, but in a large proportion of the cells they were located mainly at the periphery, just below the cytoplasmic membrane, and in the nucleus (Fig. 3, p and p′). Interestingly, these aggregates were ring-shaped. Indeed, staining revealed spherical structures in peripheral regions. These structures sometimes formed doublets (Fig. 3r′) but often formed single rings (see Fig. 4, p–r). This characteristic pattern suggests that HSP25 is located at the periphery of areas that do not contain HSP25 and that may or may not contain other elements. These aggregates and actin did not overlap in any part of the cell (Fig. 3, l, o, r, and r′). At day 4, HSP25 was again distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm of some cells (see Fig. 4p).Fig. 4Patterns of HSP25 and MK5 during the differentiation of PAM212 cells. PAM212 cells were treated as in Fig. 3 at day –2 (a–c), day 0 (d–f), day 1 (g–i), day 2 (j–l), day 3 (m–o), and day 4 (p–r). HSP25 (Cy3, red; a, d, g, j, m, and p) and MK5 (Alexa Fluor 488, green; b, e, h, k, n, and q) were detected by immunocytochemistry. c, f, i, l, o, and r, overlay of the signals. All observations were carried out on a confocal microscope (single scans). At days –2 and 0 (a–f), only a single cell layer existed. From day 1 to day 4 (g–r), several layers existed, and we focused on the upper layers. The insets in p, q, and r show an enlargement of an aggregate (bar, 2 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Thus, HSP25 forms progressively large aggregates that tend to concentrate at the edges of the cells and in the nuclei. This highly dynamic pattern, plus the increase in the amount of protein, strongly suggested that HSP25 plays a specific role in the differentiation of PAM212 cells. HSP25 Is Involved in the Dynamics of Cytokeratin Filaments during PAM212 Cell Differentiation—During the terminal differentiation of keratinocyte, the keratin MK5 and MK14 network, visible in basal cells in vivo, is replaced by a keratin MK1 and MK10 network, visible in suprabasal cells in vivo. We have already confirmed that MK1 and MK10 are actually induced during the differentiation of PAM212 cells. Given that HSP25 interacts with intermediate filaments in other systems, we analyzed whether HSP25 is involved in this switch. For this, we compared the pattern of HSP25 with that of each of these cytokeratins. We compared the pattern of HSP25 with that of MK5, which is expressed in PAM212 cells before induction. At days –2 and 0, MK5 formed a typical network of cytokeratin filaments throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, b and e). As described above, HSP25 was present in the whole cytoplasm at these stages (Fig. 4, a and c). The patterns of HSP25 and MK5 did not seem to overlap at these stages (Fig. 4, c and f). From day 1 onward, the cells in the bottom layer no longer contained either HSP25 or MK5. The distribution of MK5 and HSP25 overlapped in the upper layer cells from this stage, both forming similar aggregates (Fig. 4, g–r). The aggregates of HSP25 and MK5 are both ring-shaped (singlets or doublets) (Fig. 4, p–r). Immunocytochemical analysis showed that MK14 exhibits the same aggregation pattern as MK5 and thus HSP25 (data not shown). Thus, HSP25 interacts with the main keratins present in the basal layer in vivo. HSP25 seems to be involved in the reorganization of the keratin network during the differentiation of PAM212 cells. MK1 and MK10 were not expressed in PAM212 cells before induction but appeared during differentiation. For technical reasons, we did not directly compare MK1 and HSP25 patterns (both antibodies raised in rabbit). Instead, we compared the expression patterns of MK1 and MK5, the pattern of which is similar to that of HSP25 from day 1 onward. At day 1, MK1 was expressed in cells expressing MK5 that had started to aggregate (Fig. 5A, a–c). At day 2, more cells expressed MK1, and these cells no longer expressed MK5. The cells in the upper layers were very flat and intertwined, which sometimes made it difficult to distinguish the borders between the cells. Examination of a series of sections (averaged) from the upper layer showed that the cells expressing MK5 were distinct from those expressing MK1 (Fig. 5A, d–f). The same was observed at day 4, when a large proportion of the cells expressed MK1 and were still closely intertwined with cells expressing MK5, aggregated or not (Fig. 5A, g–i). We also compared the expression patterns of MK1 and MK10. Basically, cells expressing MK10 also expressed MK1, and some cells expressed MK1 without expressing MK10 (Fig. 5B). These observations are consistent with the kinet"

https://openalex.org/W2017972286,"The role of mitochondria in providing intracellular ATP that controls the activity of plasma membrane outward-rectifying K+ channels was evaluated. The OsCHLH rice mutant, which lacks chlorophyll in the thylakoids, was isolated by T-DNA gene trapping (Jung, K.-H., Hur, J., Ryu, C.-H., Choi, Y., Chung, Y.-Y., Miyao, A., Hirochika, H., and An, G. (2003) Plant Cell Physiol. 44, 463-472). The OsCHLH mutant is unable to fix CO2 and exhibits reduced growth. Wild type and mutant plants exhibit similar rates of respiratory O2 uptake in the dark, whereas the rate of photosynthetic O2 evolution by the mutant was negligible during illumination. During dark respiration the wild type and mutant exhibited similar levels of cytoplasmic ATP. In the mutant oligomycin treatment (an inhibitor of mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase) drastically reduced ATP production. The fact that this was reversed by the addition of glucose suggested that the mutant produced ATP exclusively from mitochondria but not from chloroplasts. In whole cell patch clamp experiments, the activity of outward-rectifying K+ channels of rice mesophyll cells showed ATP-dependent currents, which were 1.5-fold greater in wild type than in mutant cells. Channels in both wild type and mutant cells were deactivated by the removal of cytosolic ATP, whereas in the presence of ATP the channels remained active. We conclude that mesophyll cells in the OsCHLH rice mutant derive ATP from mitochondrial respiration, and that this is critical for the normal function of plasma membrane outward-rectifying K+ channels."

The refolding reaction of p13suc1 is multiphasic, and in this paper we analyze the kinetics as a function of denaturant and protein concentration and compare the behavior of wild type and a set of mutants previously designed with dimerization propensities that span 9 orders of magnitude. We show that the folding reactions of wild type and all mutants produce the monomer predominantly despite their very different equilibrium behavior. However, the addition of low concentrations of denaturant in the refolding buffer leads to thermodynamic control of the folding reaction with products that correspond to the wild type and mutant equilibrium dimerization propensities. We present evidence that the kinetic control in the absence of urea arises because of the population of the folding intermediates. Intermediates are usually considered to be detrimental to folding because they slow down the reaction; however, our work shows that intermediates buffer the monomeric folding pathway against the effect of mutations that favor the nonfunctional, dimeric state at equilibrium.

Each subunit of the dimer is highly superimposable on the monomer except for the so-called “hinge loop” that connects the swapping strand to the rest of the structure. The hinge loop forms a β-hairpin in the monomer and has an extended conformation in the dimer. In this work we present an global model of the folding and interconversion of monomeric and dimeric suc1. The description illustrates how domain swapping, by exploiting mostly native interactions, creates ambiguity in protein folding that can lead to misfolding and aggregation. Unexpectedly, however, we find that intermediates can protect the folding reaction and ensure that it leads to the correct oligomeric native product. Recent theoretical and experimental work on folding of small proteins has shown that the native state topology defines the general features of protein folding pathways, and that sequence specifities modulate it to some extent (4Plaxco K.W. Simons K.T. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 985-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 5Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This view raises two broad questions: 1) How do protein sequences favor native-like interactions at each stage of the folding process and avoid misfolding? Do proteins possess gatekeeper residues that restrict the conformational space to native regions (7Oliveberg M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), or is the overall energy bias in favor of native interactions rather than non-native ones sufficient to guide folding? 2) Even if only native interactions are favored, it is still possible to make native interactions with residues from another polypeptide chain rather than intramolecularly by the process of domain swapping? How do proteins avoid these undesirable interactions and ensure folding to the correct oligomeric state? Here we focus on the second question, which may be more significant than has previously been recognized. More than 40 proteins have now been crystallized in either a monomeric or domain-swapped form, showing that many proteins have a tendency to domain swap (8Newcomer M.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar); further, aggregation during refolding has been proposed in a number of proteins to result from domain swapping-mediated oligomerization (10Silow M. Tan Y.J. Fersht A.R. Oliveberg M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13006-13012Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Fink A.L. Fold Des. 1998; 3: R9-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Domain swapping might be even more of a problem within the crowded environment of the cell (12Ellis R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 114-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). One way to avoid misfolding and aggregation via domain swapping in the cell could be to assist folding with chaperones, thus providing an Anfinsen cage for monomers to fold in isolation. Our results on suc1 suggest another way; partly structured intermediates can limit misfolding by protecting the route to the biologically active state when mutations accumulate for functional reasons that energetically disfavor this state and instead favor domain-swapped misfolded states. This beneficial role of intermediates contrasts with the more commonly held negative view of intermediates as species that slow folding and reduce the cooperativity of the process, thereby acting as precursors to aggregation; in the latter case, however, misfolding is likely to be mediated by non-native intermolecular interactions rather than the native ones that characterize domain swapping. Materials—High purity urea was obtained from Rose Chemicals Ltd. All other chemicals were from Sigma or BDH. Protein Expression and Purification—The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (13Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W.H. delPino M.S. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol.

Briefly, the harvested cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA and then lysed by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was heat treated at 70 °C for 3-5 min, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. A 70% ammonium sulfate precipitation was then performed, followed by dialysis into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA overnight at 4 °C. Remaining nucleic acid contamination was removed using 5 mg of protamine sulfate/30 mg of protein followed by centrifugation. The sample was filtered and loaded on a preparative Superdex G75/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tri-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 300 mm NaCl. The elution peak corresponding to the monomer was collected for wild type protein and the majority of the mutants. Mutants EP91 and Δ8789 were found to be predominantly in the dimer form, and therefore the dimer peak was collected for these proteins. The sample were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C to remove the salt and then purified further by ion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) with a gradient of 0-300 mm NaCl. The purified proteins were stored at -80 °C after dialysis in 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA. The samples were pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The buffer used for subsequent experiments was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, unless stated otherwise. EDTA was used to prevent the formation of zinc-mediated, nondomain-swapped dimers. Stopped Flow Measurements—Kinetic experiments were performed using an Applied Photophysics stopped flow instrument. For monitoring protein folding, fluorescence was collected above 320 nm using a cut-off filter upon excitation at 280 nm. Between three and five scans were collected at each denaturant concentration and averaged. Kinetic unfolding experiments were performed by mixing protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA with 5 or 10 volumes of urea, containing the same buffer to give final concentrations of denaturant in which the protein is >99% unfolded. pH jump refolding experiments were performed as follows. The protein was denatured in 30 mm HCl. Refolding was initiated by rapid mixing with renaturing buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA) to give a final buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. Refolding was also measured in buffer containing different concentrations of urea. Anilinonaphthalene-l-sulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescence was collected above 410 nm using a cut-off filter after excitation at 390 nm. ANS was added to the refolding buffer at a concentration of 15 μm, and the protein concentration was 150 μm. Determination of Monomer and Dimer Content by Size Exclusion Chromatography—As described previously (14Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W.H. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Procl. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), monomer and dimer forms of suc1 were separated by analytical size exclusion chromatography using a Amersham Biosciences Superdex 75 or Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column connected to a Amersham Biosciences Δkta system and equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA at 25 °C. The monomer elutes at 12.4 ml, and the dimer elutes at 10.5 ml. It is very unlikely that these two elution peaks correspond to any other species; the unfolded protein, for example, elutes at a low elution volume and is not populated under these native buffer conditions. The two peaks are well separated with the absorbance signal returning to the base-line level between the two. The rate of interconversion between monomer and dimer is extremely slow at room temperature (complete equilibration takes months), and therefore gel filtration does not alter the monomer-dimer ratio of the sample. This is confirmed by the observation that reinjection of the monomer peak or the dimer peak gives a single elution peak corresponding to the monomer or the dimer, respectively. The relative amounts of monomer and dimer present in the sample can be obtained by integrating the area under the peaks in the chromatogram. This was done using the UNICORN software package from Amersham Biosciences. We showed previously that partitioning between monomer and domain-swapped dimer is controlled by two prolines in the hinge loop that generate strain in the monomer (P90) and dimer (P92) hinge conformations (14Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W.H. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Procl. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Schymkowitz J.W. Rousseau F. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similar observations about the role of strained hinge loops in domain swapping have since been made in the B1 domain of protein L (17O'Neill J.W. Kim D.E. Johnsen K. Baker D. Zhang K.Y. Structure. 2001; 9: 1017-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The monomer-dimer equilibrium of suc1 can be monitored by analytical gel filtration chromatography, and the Kd obtained for wild type was 1.8 mm; at protein concentrations in the 1-5 μm range, suc1 is >99% monomeric at equilibrium (14Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W.H. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Procl. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The mutants were designed previously by manipulating the strain with dissociation constants spanning 9 orders of magnitude (summarized in Table I). The mutant PA90 is an obligate monomer at protein concentrations in the micromolar to millimolar range. PA92 has a much lower Kd, but in the micromolar range it is also mainly monomeric. EP91 is mainly dimeric at low micromolar concentrations, and Δ8789 (deletion of residues 87-89) is an obligate dimer.Table IThermodynamic data for suc1 wild type and mutantsWild typePA90PA92Δ8789EP91Kd (μm)aKd values were taken from Rousseau et al. (14). Because the Kd for PA90, Δ8789, and EP 91 is very high or very low, measurements could not be made in the concentration range around the Kd, and these values are only estimates. Between different measurements there is 5% variability, and therefore allowing for the extreme Kd values, the errors are quoted as 10%.1850 ± 30886 × 103 ± 9 × 102180 ± 100.001 ± 10−30.1 ± .01ku monomer (× 10−3 s−1)bValues for wild type and PA90 taken from Ref. 16.2.2 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.2580 ± 277.6 ± 0.6kfmonomer (s−1)bValues for wild type and PA90 taken from Ref. 16.68 ± 0.367 ± 0.380 ± 0.563 ± 0.424 ± 0.1ku dimer (× 10−3 s−1)cValues for wild type, PA90, and PA92 were taken from Ref. 19.1.4 ± 0.27.2 ± 0.23.4 ± 1.00.025 ± 0.0010.049 ± 0.001kfapp dimer (s−1)dValues for kfapp (dimer) was determined at 5 μm protein concentration, using the following equation, kfapp(dimer)=kfapp(monomer)×fdimer, where fdimer is the fraction of dimer formed upon refolding (fdimer = [D]/[M]).4.8 ± 0.34.0 ± 0.27.9 ± 0.52.8 ± 0.20.5 ± 0.03ΔΔGdissociation (kcal mol−1)eChange of the free energy of dissociation on mutation, ΔΔGdissociation, calculated from the Kd values of wild type and mutants.−3.65 ± 0.061.38 ± 0.048.54 ± 0.065.82 ± 0.06ΔΔGmonomer intermediate (kcal mol−1)fChange upon mutation in the difference in free energy of the monomer intermediate relative to the monomeric native state ΔΔGmonomer intermediate, calculated from the refolding and unfolding rate constants of wild type and mutants using ΔΔGmonomerintermediate=-RTln((kuWT/kumutant)/(kfWT/kfmutant)).0.67 ± 0.10.25 ± 0.05−3.34 ± 0.08−1.35 ± 0.05ΔΔGmonomer transition (kcal mol−1)gChange upon mutation in the difference in free energy of the monomer transition state relative to the monomeric native state ΔΔGmonomer transition, calculated from the unfolding rate constants of wild type and mutants using ΔΔGmonomer.0.68 ± 0.10.15 ± 0.05−3.30 ± 0.05−0.73 ± 0.08ΔΔGmonomer (kcal mol−1)hChange upon mutation in the free energy of unfolding the monomer, ΔΔGmonomer, calculated from the midpoint of unfolding and m value from equilibrium denaturation of wild type and mutants as described in Ref. 16.1.19 ± 0.040.07 ± 0.04−2.63 ± 0.06−1.68 ± 0.08ΔΔGdimer intermediate/2 (kcal mol−1)iChange upon mutation in the difference in free energy of the dimer intermediate relative to the dimeric native state, ΔΔGdimer intermediate, calculated as for the monomer in footnote f.

Open table in a new tab Refolding to Monomer and Dimer Is under Kinetic Control—The proportions of suc1 monomer and dimer produced in the refolding reaction were measured by gel filtration analysis of samples immediately after refolding. The two forms of suc1 are separated by a large kinetic barrier, as is the case for many domain swapping proteins (18Bennett M.J. Choe S. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), and therefore the monomer-dimer ratio does not change during the analysis. We find that the relative amounts of monomer and dimer formed upon refolding are under kinetic rather than thermodynamic control (Fig. 2); refolding of 5 μm suc1 from the acid-denatured state produces only 93% monomer, which is less than expected from the Kd. Subsequently, over a period of weeks, the 7% dimer and 93% monomer that is formed in the refolding reaction slowly converts to the equilibrium proportions of 1% dimer and 99% monomer. The Monomer-Dimer Ratio Formed on Refolding of the Mutants Is Similar to That of Wild Type Despite Large Changes in Dissociation Constant—We next determined the monomer-dimer ratios formed on refolding the domain swapping mutants, PA90, EP91, and Δ8789. Surprisingly, we find that although wild type and the mutants vary greatly in the relative amounts of monomer and dimer populated at equilibrium, they show a striking uniformity in the proportions of monomer and dimer formed upon refolding from the denatured state (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, EP91 has a much greater dimerization propensity than wild type (Kd = 0.1 μm) and populates only 10% monomer at equilibrium at 5 μm protein concentration, but it forms even less dimer than does the wild type upon refolding. Monomeric EP91 is metastable, and equilibration to the more stable dimer species requires several weeks at room temperature. At the other extreme, Δ8789 (Kd = 1 nm) is 99% dimeric at equilibrium, yet it forms 96% monomer upon refolding at a concentration of 5 μm; conversion of Δ8789 monomer to the equilibrium proportion of 99% takes only 24 h, indicating that the kinetic barrier for monomer to dimer conversion is greatly reduced in this mutant (Fig. 3B). Our results show that mutants with Kd values spanning over 9 orders of magnitude all refold to approximately the same monomer-dimer ratio. Thus, the equilibrium partitioning between monomer and dimer can be altered by redesigning the hinge loop, but the folding reaction is unchanged. Even EP91 and Δ8789, mutants that are obligate dimers at equilibrium, refold predominantly to monomer; for these mutants, the monomer is a metastable state that is formed first and then is slowly converted to the more stable dimeric state. Wild Type and Mutants Refold in Low Denaturant Concentrations to the Equilibrium Monomer-Dimer Ratios—When wild type is refolded in buffer containing low urea concentrations (∼1-2 m), kinetic control is no longer observed, and instead the equilibrium proportions of monomer and dimer are produced. Fig. 4A shows the proportion of dimer formed on refolding plotted as a function of urea concentration in the refolding buffer. At 5 μm protein concentration, 7% dimer is formed in the absence of urea, whereas in 1-2 M urea, the equilibrium proportion of ∼1% is formed. Similar behavior is seen at 25 μm protein concentration (Fig. 4A). Likewise, the mutants refold in low urea to the proportions of monomer and dimer expected from each of their Kd values. The mutant Δ8789 illustrates this behavior most clearly. Refolding of 100 μm Δ8789 in the absence of urea yields 60% monomer, whereas refolding in 1.5 m urea yields >99% dimer (the equilibrium proportion) (Fig. 4B). An alternative explanation for the apparent switch from kinetic control of the folding reaction in the absence of urea to thermodynamic control in the presence of urea is that urea speeds up the interconversion between monomer and dimer once folding is complete; the interconversion process is known to require significant unfolding (14Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W.H. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Procl. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and therefore urea is expected to speed it up. However, this explanation can be ruled out because monomer-dimer interconversion is still very slow (of the order of hours) at the low urea concentrations at which the switch is observed. Refolding Occurs via an Intermediate—The product of refolding suc1 at 1 μm is >99% monomer, and the major refolding phase measured by stopped flow fluorescence was shown previously to have a rate constant at low denaturant concentrations that deviates from that expected for a two-state mechanism (Fig. 5A) (13Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W.H. delPino M.S. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This downward curvature in the refolding arm of the chevron plot can be interpreted as arising from the population of an intermediate before the rate-limiting transition state, {U-IM}-‡M-M where U denotes the denatured state, IM is the intermediate, ‡M is the rate-determining transition state, and M is the monomer native state. The brackets indicate a rapid pre-equilibrium between the denatured state and the intermediate. (There is also slight curvature in the unfolding arm of the chevron plot that has been ascribed to Hammond-like movement of the transition state (13Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W.H. delPino M.S. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the chevron plot for two-state folding, given by the solid line in Fig. 5A and from which the observed rate constant for refolding deviates, was calculated assuming a smooth movement of the transition state across the whole denaturant range.) Further evidence for an intermediate comes from experiments performed with the hydrophobic dye ANS that indicate that there is a species formed in the refolding reaction within the dead time of the stopped flow that binds ANS and that subsequent release of ANS occurs on the time scale of the major phase in the refolding reaction monitored by intrinsic protein fluorescence (Fig. 6). Measurement of the rate of refolding of suc1 at protein concentrations between 0.2 and 2 μm revealed no significant protein concentration dependence of the rate or relative amplitude of the major refolding phase (13Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W.H. delPino M.S. Itzhaki L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the major refolding phase does indeed correspond to the formation of the monomer form rather than the oligomeric forms of the protein. Further, we know that dimeric suc1 forms directly from the unfolded state and that association occurs early in the reaction (14Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W.H. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Procl. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, the following minimal model applies to the folding pathways of monomeric and dimeric suc1, 2M-2‡M-{2IM-2U}-‡D-D where ‡D is the rate-determining step for formation of the dimer (D). Below we show data consistent with a model in which 1) the folding pathway to dimeric suc1 proceeds through a distinct intermediate that is dimeric and 2) the monomeric and dimeric intermediates are responsible for the kinetic control of the folding of suc1. Dimeric suc1 Folds via a Dimeric Intermediate—The proportions of monomer and dimer formed upon refolding reflect the relative rates of formation of the two states. Therefore, the apparent rate constant of formation of the dimer can be calculated from the following equation, kf,dimerapparent=&percnt;dimer&percnt;monomer·kf,monomer where kf, monomer is the refolding rate constant of monomer as measured by stopped flow fluorescence, and % monomer and % dimer are the percentages of monomer and dimer formed in the reaction, as determined by analytical gel filtration chromatography. A plot of lnkf,dimerapparentversus urea concentration displays roll-over at low urea concentrations (Fig. 5B), indicating an intermediate on the dimeric folding pathway. Further, the fraction of dimer formed in the reaction, and consequently lnkf,dimerapparent also, is dependent on protein concentration (Fig. 4A). Together, the roll-over and the dependence on protein concentration are consistent with the refolding pathway to the dimer occurring via a dimeric intermediate that is distinct from the monomeric folding intermediate. Kinetic Control in suc1 Is a Consequence of the Presence of the Two Intermediates—Two regimes are apparent in the plot of the fraction of dimeric product, fdimer, versus the concentration of urea in the refolding buffer (Fig. 4A): 1) At low urea concentration, fdimer decreases steeply with increasing urea concentration. In this part of the plot, fdimer is different from the value expected from the Kd, and folding is under kinetic control. From Fig. 5B we see that this corresponds to the region of the chevron plot where the intermediates are populated and cause roll-over. The slope of the plot of fdimerversus urea concentration in this regime is shallower at the higher protein concentration. Again, this is consistent with a dimeric intermediate being more stable at higher protein concentration and being depopulated less rapidly with urea, with the consequence that the fraction of dimer formed in the refolding reaction decreases less rapidly with urea at the higher protein concentration. 2) At higher urea concentrations, but before the midpoint of the unfolding transition, fdimer is approximately constant and equal to the value that is expected from the Kd (Fig. 4A); here folding is under thermodynamic control, and from Fig. 5B, we see that this corresponds to the region of the lnkf plot where the intermediates are depopulated. The mutants behave in the same way; refolding of 100 μm Δ8789 in buffer yielded 60% monomer. In contrast, refolding of Δ8789 in buffer containing 1 m urea yielded >99% (equilibrium proportion) of dimer (Fig. 4B). From the chevron plot for this mutant (Fig. 5C), we see again that under conditions where there is roll-over, indicating the population of intermediate, refolding of Δ8789 is under kinetic control, whereas thermodynamic control occurs when the intermediate is depopulated. Thus, kinetic control of"

So far, three APC cleavage sites have been identified in the heavy chain of FVa: Arg-306, Arg-506, and Arg-679. To obtain more insight in the structural and functional implications of each individual cleavage, recombinant factor V (rFV) mutants were constructed in which two or three of the APC cleavage sites were mutated. After expression in COS-1 cells, rFV mutants were purified, activated with thrombin, and inactivated by APC. During this study we observed that activated rFV-GQA (rFVa-GQA), in which the arginines at positions 306, 506, and 679 were replaced by glycine, glutamine, and alanine, respectively, was still inactivated by APC. Further analysis showed that the inactivation of rFVa-GQA by APC was phospholipid-dependent and sensitive to an inhibitory monoclonal antibody against protein C. Inactivation proceeded via a rapid phase (kx1 = 5.4 × 104m-1 s-1) and a slow phase (kx2 = 3.2 × 103m-1 s-1). Analysis of the inactivation curves showed that the rapid phase yielded a reaction intermediate that retained ∼80% of the original FVa activity, whereas the slow cleavage resulted in formation of a completely inactive reaction product. Inactivation of rFVa-GQA was accelerated by protein S, most likely via stimulation of the slow phase. Immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal antibody recognizing an epitope between Arg-306 and Arg-506 indicated that during the rapid phase of inactivation a fragment of 80 kDa was generated that resulted from cleavage at a residue very close to Arg-506. The slow phase was associated with the formation of fragments resulting from cleavage at a residue 1.5-2 kDa carboxyl-terminal to Arg-306. Our observations may explain the unexpectedly mild APC resistance associated with mutations at Arg-306 (FV HongKong and FV Cambridge) in the heavy chain of FV.

FVa is formed via limited proteolysis of its single chain precursor FV (∼330 kDa) by thrombin. It consists of a heavy chain (∼105 kDa) and a light chain (71-74 kDa), which are held together via a Ca2+ ion. FVa is an essential part of the prothrombinase complex, which composes FVa, FXa, calcium ions, and a negatively charged membrane surface. In this complex FVa acts as a non-enzymatic cofactor that accelerates FXa-catalyzed prothrombin activation 103-105-fold (3Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Proteolytic inactivation of FVa by activated protein C (APC) is an essential reaction in the anticoagulant protein C pathway (6Esmon C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), which is important in the regulation of thrombin formation and in the inhibition of acute inflammation triggered by coagulation (7Esmon C.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Congenital deficiencies in this pathway are associated with thrombotic disease (8Griffin J.H. Evatt B. Zimmerman T.S.

Investig. 1984; 74: 2082-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Inactivation of FVa activity by APC is associated with cleavage of three peptide bonds in the heavy chain of FVa, which have been localized at Arg-306, Arg-506, and Arg-679 (10Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several mutations have been reported in the APC cleavage sites of human FV. The most important one is FV Leiden (FVL), in which arginine 506 has been replaced by glutamine (11Bertina R.M. Koeleman B.P. Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. Dirven R.J. de Ronde H. van der Velden P.A.

Lancet. 1994; 343: 1535-1536Abstract PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). This mutation results in the laboratory phenotype of APC resistance and is associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (11Bertina R.M. Koeleman B.P. Koster T. Rosendaal F.R.

Lancet. 1995; 346: 1133-1134Abstract PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar)) makes this mutation the most important heritable risk factor for venous thrombosis. Besides FVL, three other mutations have been found in the APC cleavage sites of FV. All three affect the Arg-306 position and are much less frequent than FV Leiden (17Williamson D. Brown K. Luddington R. Baglin C. Baglin T. Blood. 1998; 91: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Chan W.P. Lee C.K. Kwong Y.L. Lam C.K. Liang R.

Santos S.E. Zago M.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 312-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). There are no indications that the mutations at Arg-306 are associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis (18Chan W.P. Lee C.K. Kwong Y.L. Lam C.K. Liang R.

Haematol. 1998; 103: 888-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, the effect of these mutations on the sensitivity to APC is not entirely clear. Studies using recombinant FV have shown that mutations at Arg-306 result in an unexpectedly mild APC-resistant phenotype (22Heeb M.J. Rehemtulla A. Moussalli M. Kojima Y. Kaufman R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23van der Neut Kolfschoten M. Dirven R.J. Tans G. Rosing J. Vos H.L. Bertina R.M. Blood Coagul.

Several studies have been performed to obtain more insight in the complex mechanism of APC-catalyzed FVa inactivation. These investigations demonstrated that cleavage of the heavy chain of FVa by APC is stimulated by negatively charged phospholipids (25Walker F.J. Sexton P.W. Esmon C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 571: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 26Suzuki K. Stenflo J. Dahlback B. Teodorsson B. J. Biol.

In the presence of negatively charged phospholipids, the inactivation of FVa by APC proceeds via a rapid and a slow phase, which are associated with cleavages at Arg-506 and Arg-306, respectively (10Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nicolaes G.A. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Cleavage at Arg-506 yields a reaction intermediate with reduced FVa activity, which is completely inactivated by the subsequent cleavage at Arg-306. Inactivation of activated FVL is monophasic and associated with cleavage at Arg-306, which was stimulated ∼20-fold by protein S (31Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C.

In the presence of negatively charged phospholipids, the contribution of the cleavage at Arg-679 to the inactivation of FVa seems to be minor and is difficult to assess (30Nicolaes G.A. Tans G.

The original objective of the present study was to investigate the functional and structural implications of each individual APC cleavage in more detail. Recombinant factor V mutants were constructed in which a major part of the B-domain (rFVΔB) was removed and two or three of the APC cleavage sites were mutated. After expression in COS-1 cells, rFV mutants were purified, activated with thrombin, and inactivated by APC. Interestingly, rFVa-GQA (rFVa in which the arginines at positions 306, 506, and 679 were replaced by glycine, glutamine, and alanine, respectively) was still inactivated by APC. In this paper we report on the mechanism of APC-catalyzed inactivation of rFVa-GQA. Materials—Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. Rapid ligation kit and BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (peroxidase) were obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Plasmid isolation kits were purchased from Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA. DNA restriction fragments were purified from agarose gel using the Cleanmix kit (Talent, Trieste, Italy). CNBr-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), 98% fatty acid-free, was from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). Ovalbumin, benzamidine, phosphatidylcholine (PC), N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin, and Hepes were from Sigma. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL. EDTA was from Serva, Heidelberg, Germany. NH4Cl, Tris, and CaCl2 were purchased from Merck. Chromogenic substrate S-2238 was obtained from Chromogenix, Uppsala, Sweden. 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was from Roche Diagnostics. Proteins—Human APC, protein S, prothrombin, and thrombin were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The APC concentration was determined from APC antigen and activity measurements. APC antigen was measured by ELISA using IgG fractions of rabbit anti-human protein C (DakoCytomation Denmark A/S, Glostrup, Denmark), whereas APC activity was measured with S2366 using the kinetic parameters reported by Sala et al. (32Sala N. Owen W.G. Collen D. Blood. 1984; 63: 671-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human factor Xa and monoclonal antibodies AHV-5146 and AHV-5112 were from Hematologic Technologies Inc., Essex, VT. Monoclonal antibody 3B1 directed against the heavy chain of human FV was a kind gift from Prof. B. N. Bouma. Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was from Bio-Rad. Neutralite™ avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was from Southern Biotechnology Associated, Inc., Birmingham, AL. Human FVL was isolated from human plasma according to Nicolaes et al. (30Nicolaes G.A. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). FV Antigen Assay—FV light chain antigen was measured by ELISA using two different monoclonal antibodies directed against the light chain of FV (33Guasch J.F. Cannegieter S. Reitsma P.H. Van't Veer-Korthof E.T. Bertina R.M. Br. J. Haematol. 1998; 101: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this ELISA, mAb V-6 was used as coating antibody and biotinylated mAb V-9 as tagging antibody. Mutagenesis—In this study expression vectors (pMT2) were used containing the cDNA of FV in which two or three APC cleavage sites were mutated (23van der Neut Kolfschoten M. Dirven R.J. Tans G.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In these mutants the arginines at positions 306, 506, or 679 were replaced by glycine, glutamine, and alanine, respectively (see Table I). The vectors were used to construct FV expression vectors lacking a major part of the B-domain (deletion from amino acids 827-1499) as described before (35van der Neut Kolfschoten M. Dirven R.J. Vos H.L. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).

Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with serum-free medium (Opti-MEM Glutamax, Invitrogen). Conditioned medium was harvested after 72 h, centrifuged for 20 min at 3000 rpm (4 °C), and frozen at -20 °C. FV expression was measured by functional FV assay and ELISA. Recombinant FVΔB mutants were isolated in a two-step procedure essentially as described previously (35van der Neut Kolfschoten M. Dirven R.J. Vos H.L. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, conditioned medium was thawed, supplemented with 10 mm benzamidine, and loaded on an ion exchange column (SP-Sepharose fast flow), which was subsequently washed with 25 mm Hepes, 100 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5, until the fall-through was protein-free. Recombinant FVΔB was eluted from the column with 25 mm Hepes, 1.5 m NH4Cl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm benzamidine, pH 7.5. Fractions containing FVa activity were supplemented with 2 mg/ml ovalbumin, dialyzed against a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm benzamidine, pH 7.3, pooled, and applied at a speed of 3 ml/h to an affinity column, consisting of 1 mg mAb-3B1/ml Sepharose. The column was washed with 25 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3, and eluted with 25 mm Hepes, 1.8 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3. Eluted fractions were screened for FV (activity/antigen) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. FV containing fractions were supplemented with 2 mg/ml ovalbumin, dialyzed against 25 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.3, and stored at -80 °C. Factor Va Activity Assay—FVa activity was measured in a two-step procedure as described previously (35van der Neut Kolfschoten M. Dirven R.J. Vos H.L. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This assay was calibrated using dilutions of pooled normal plasma corresponding with 0-3 pm FV. Inactivation of FVa by APC—FVa (∼1 nm) was incubated with APC (see legends) in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 175 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 5 mg/ml BSA, 24.5 μm phospholipids (DOPS/DOPC, 10:90). At different time intervals, 10-μl samples were transferred to 240 μl of prothrombinase mix (containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 175 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mg/ml ovalbumin, FXa, prothrombin, and DOPS/DOPC, 10:90 molar ratio) yielding final concentrations of 5 nm FXa, 540 nm prothrombin, and 50 μm DOPS/DOPC vesicles. After 3 min of incubation at 37 °C, prothrombin activation was stopped by subsampling 40 μl in 460 μl of TN-EDTA (50 mm Tris, 175 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml ovalbumin, pH 7.9). Subsequently, 200 μl of this mix were transferred to a 96-well plate, and 25 μl of chromogenic substrate S-2238 (2.35 mm) was added, after which the amount of thrombin formed was measured kinetically on a Spectra III Thermo microtiter plate reader from Tecan (Salzburg, Austria). Under these conditions the formation of thrombin was linearly dependent on the FVa concentration present in the prothrombinase mixture. The FVa activity measured before the addition of APC (t = 0) was set at 100%. Curve Fitting of Time Courses of FVa Inactivation—Time courses of APC-catalyzed FVa inactivation were obtained by measuring loss of FVa activity as a function of time. Data reported in this paper indicate that inactivation of the activated rFVΔB-GQA mutant by APC proceeds via two pathways (Pathways 1 and 2), Va→k1VaB→k2Vi(Eq. 1) Va→k3Vi This model is similar to the inactivation of plasma FVa via cleavages at Arg-506 and Arg-306 (30Nicolaes G.A.

Under first-order conditions, i.e. conditions at which the inactivation rate is directly proportional to the factor Va and APC concentration, the loss of FVa cofactor activity is described by Equation 1 (30Nicolaes G.A.

Vat=Va0·e-(k1+k3)t+B·Va0·k1·e-k2·tk1+k3-k2·(1-e-(k1+k3-k2)·t) In this equation Vat is the FVa activity at time t; Va0 is the FVa activity at time 0; B is the activity of the FVa intermediate generated after cleavage at Rx1. k1, k2, and k3 are the observed pseudo first-order rate constants, from which the second-order rate constants were calculated as follows: kx1 = k1/[APC], kx2 = (k2 - k′s)/[APC] and k′x2 = (k3 - ks)/[APC], in which k′s and ks are the first-order rate constants of spontaneous inactivation of the FVa intermediate (FVaB) and intact FVa, respectively. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—PAGE was performed on SDS-PAGE (Tris/HCl prefab gels, Gradipore, French Forest, Australia) under reducing conditions according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Protein transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) was carried out semi-dry on a blot system from Amersham Biosciences. To detect FV, murine monoclonal antibodies against the heavy and light chain (AHV-5146 and AHV-5112, respectively) were used. Goat antimouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase in combination with the peroxidase blotting substrate was used to visualize the immobilized antibodies. Both antibodies were checked for any cross-reaction with BSA present in the FV fractions and were found negative. Visualization with AHV5146 was optimized to detect low molecular degradation fragments from the heavy chain (see also Fig. 1). Due to the high sensitivity of this procedure, small amounts of intact heavy chains still show significant staining (see also Ref. 41Norstrom E.A. Steen M. Tran S. Dahlback B. J. Biol.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Factor V Mutants—Recombinant FVΔB mutants were constructed with mutations either in two or in three of the known APC cleavage sites (Arg-306, Arg-506, and Arg-679). In analogy to the naturally occurring FV HongKong (R306G) and FV Leiden (R506Q) mutations, Arg-306 was replaced by glycine and Arg-506 by glutamine, whereas Arg-679 was replaced by alanine (Table I). After transfection of COS-1 cells, conditioned media containing the rFVΔB molecules were collected, centrifuged, and stored at -20 °C. Factor V expression levels (activity and antigen) of rFVΔB-wt and its mutants were similar and ranged (depending on the transfection efficiency) between 0.2 and 4 nm. After thawing and pooling of conditioned media, rFVΔB proteins were purified by ion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography. The rFVΔB mutants were activated with thrombin and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or immunoblotting. Both detection methods showed two dominant bands with a molecular mass of 105 and 71 kDa, which corresponded to the expected molecular mass of the heavy and light chain of factor Va, respectively (data not shown). Apart from these two bands, also variable amounts of 90-kDa fragment were observed, which was most likely the result of thrombin cleavage at Arg-643 (37Hockin M.F. Kalafatis M. Shatos M. Mann K.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2765-2775Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The specific activities (activity/antigen) of the purified rFV mutants were slightly lower than in conditioned medium, being around 0.7. Stability of Activated rFVΔB Mutants—Recombinant FVΔB proteins were activated with 9 nm thrombin for 20 min at 37 °C and incubated in the absence or presence of phospholipids. The stability of the activated rFVΔB mutants was assessed by following the loss of FVa activity as a function of time in a reaction mixture that did not contain APC. The first-order rate constants for spontaneous inactivation of activated rFVΔB-wt and the activated rFVΔB mutants were approximately similar, being around ∼3.0 × 10-5 s-1, which corresponds to a spontaneous loss of FVa activity of ∼0.2% per min. The presence of phospholipids did not influence the stability of the activated rFV molecules. APC-catalyzed Inactivation of Activated rFVΔB-GQA—Preliminary experiments showed that apart from the activated rFVΔB double mutants (rFVΔB-RQA, rFVΔB-GRA, rFVΔB-GQR) also the activated triple mutant rFVa-GQA was inactivated by APC and that this inactivation was strongly dependent on the presence of negatively charged phospholipids (Fig. 2). In the absence of phospholipids, inactivation of rFVa-GQA by 20 nm APC was only slightly faster than the spontaneous loss of activity. Preincubation of APC with a monoclonal antibody against protein C (C12), which blocks the active site of APC, or with 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (a nonspecific inhibitor of serine proteases) inhibited the activation of rFVa-GQA by APC, whereas preincubation with a monoclonal antibody against protein S (S18) did not affect the rate of inactivation (Table III). This indicates that the loss of FVa activity observed in the presence of APC and phospholipids (Fig. 2) was indeed mediated by APC and not a contaminating protease.Table IIIEffect of APC inhibitor C12 on APC-catalyzed loss of FVa activity of activated rFVΔB-GQA Activated rFVΔB-GQA was incubated for 180 min at 37 °C in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 175 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 5 mg/ml BSA with 20 nm APC, which had been preincubated with anti-protein C antibody C12 (∼60 μg/ml), anti-protein S antibody S18 (∼60 μg/ml), or 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (80 μm). The remaining FVa activity is shown.Condition-APCaResidual FVa activity determined after 180 min in the absence of APC was set at 100%+APC+APC/ C12+APC/S18+APC/APMSF%FVa activity10032753481a Residual FVa activity determined after 180 min in the absence of APC was set at 100% Open table in a new tab Inactivation of Activated rFVΔB-GQA with Increasing APC Concentrations—The results presented above indicate that the inactivation of rFVa-GQA by APC results from one or more proteolytic cleavages at still unidentified cleavage sites. To learn more about the mechanism of inactivation, rFVa-GQA was incubated with increasing concentrations of APC under pseudo first-order conditions. Increasing the APC concentration resulted in an acceleration of FVa inactivation (Fig. 3a). The FVa inactivation curves could not be fitted with a single exponential (data not shown), indicating that inactivation involves at least two different reactions, a rapid reaction resulting in a partially active FVa molecule that is subsequently completely inactivated via a slow reaction. Because the rate constant for the second reaction was much lower than that for the first reaction, it was possible to calculate the pseudo first-order rate constant (k2) for the second reaction and the activity of the FVa intermediate (FVaB) from semi-logarithmic plots (Fig. 3b). The slope of the lines yields k2 at different APC concentrations, and the intercept at the y axis yields an estimate for the FVa activity remaining in the intermediate (FVaB), which was found to be ∼80%. Fig. 3c shows that the pseudo first-order rate constant k2 obtained for the second slow reaction is a linear function of the APC concentration, which enabled calculation of the second-order rate constant (kx2 = 3.2 × 103m-1 s-1) for the second cleavage reaction. The line extrapolated to a rate constant of 5.6 × 10-5 s-1 at [APC] = 0 (intercept of the line with the y-axis), which most likely reflects the spontaneous loss of activity of the"
https://openalex.org/W1967780764,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) plays a key role in gene expression, by suppressing the transcription of a number of target genes. Identification of such genes is important for deciphering the functional role of HDAC. Here, using cancer gene-focused DNA microarray analysis, we identified plakoglobin as a new target gene of HDAC. Functional inhibition of HDAC by its specific inhibitors induced the expression of plakoglobin by eight-fold in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. However, the expression of beta-catenin, which is closely related to plakoglobin, was not altered, implying the specific function of HDAC in plakoglobin expression. Using antiacetyl-H4 antibody, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the distal region (-945 approximately -646) of the promoter of plakoglobin is responsible for the HDAC-mediated repression of the gene. Moreover, the induced expression of plakoglobin by the inhibition of HDAC activated the Tcf/Lef-dependent luciferase reporter gene, a well-known downstream effector of the Wnt signaling pathway. Furthermore, transient transfection of plakoglobin also activated Tcf/Lef reporter gene expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that plakoglobin is a new target gene governed by HDAC, and that it acts as an oncogene in HT1080 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050386502,"We have developed and tested successfully a general method based on Cre-mediated recombination that can be used for ubiquitous or tissue-specific expression of protein products, including tumor-inducing oncoproteins. Depending on the specificity of a chosen promoter driving cre expression, tumors develop by design in bitransgenic mouse progeny derived by crossing Cre-producing mice with partners carrying a dormant oncogenic transgene (targeted into the 3' noncoding region of the cytoplasmic beta-actin locus) that becomes functional after excision of a 'floxed' DNA segment. To provide proof-of-principle, we have used as models transgenes encoding the polyomavirus middle T antigen (PVMT) and the T antigens of the SV40 early region (SVER). Cre-dependent activation of widespread SVER expression resulted in hyperplasias or invasive tumors affecting particular visceral smooth muscles, whereas Cre-dependent, mammary gland-specific expression of PVMT-induced adenocarcinomas, according to plan. Unexpectedly, we also encountered spontaneous (Cre-independent) oncogene expression occurring as a rare event, which simulates the initiation of sporadic tumors and leads to PVMT-induced hemangiomas and mammary carcinomas or SVER-induced disseminated sarcomas, thus, revealing particular tissue susceptibilities to the actions of these oncoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1981069964,"SCF complexes are a conserved family of ubiquitin ligases composed of a common core of components and a variable component called an F-box protein that defines substrate specificity. The F-box motif links the F-box protein to the core components via its interaction with Skp1p. In yeast, the SCFMet30p complex contains the Met30p F-box protein and regulates Met4p, a transcription factor that mediates sulfur fixation and methionine biosynthesis. Although a nuclear protein, Met30p lacks a definable nuclear localization sequence. Here we show that the entire amino-terminal half of Met30p is required for its proper nuclear localization. Mutations in the F-box, but not mutations in Skp1p, affect Met30p nuclear localization, indicating that the F-box motif plays an important role in Met30p trafficking independent of its interaction with Skp1p binding. Met30p mutants that poorly localize to the nucleus display increased nuclear to cytoplasmic exchange, indicating that the amino terminus mediates nuclear retention in addition to nuclear import. The Met30p F-box motif, residues 180–225, is necessary and sufficient to bind Skp1p; however, mutations upstream of the Met30p F-box inhibit Skp1p binding.

Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). The transfer of Ub onto a protein substrate is a multistep process. A Ub-activating enzyme (E1) activates Ub in an ATP-dependent manner, resulting in the formation of a thiolester linkage between the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Ub and the active site cysteine of the E1. Ub is then transferred, via a thiolester linkage, to a member of a family of Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2s). E2 enzymes have the ability to conjugate Ub to an nonphysiological protein substrate in vitro. An isopeptide bond between the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Ub and the ϵ-amine of a substrate lysine is formed. Reiteration of this linkage, using a lysine within Ub itself, results in the formation of a poly-Ub chain on the substrate protein. To target specific substrates in vivo, Ub-conjugating enzymes require additional proteins to facilitate this step, referred to as Ub ligases (E3s). One of the largest families of ubiquitin E3 ligases is the evolutionarily conserved multimeric complex referred to as the SCF family (for review, see Refs. 4Craig K.L. Tyers M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 299-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar and 5Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) named after the components that were initially identified (Skp1p, Cdc53p, and an F-box protein). SCF complexes contain a common set of components, namely Skp1p, Cdc53p (or cullin in higher eukaryotes), and the RING protein Hrt1p (alternatively named Rbx1p or Roc1p). The latter is thought to provide a docking site for an E2 enzyme, and in yeast the major E2 associated with SCF complexes is Cdc34p. These proteins are linked to a variable protein component, called the F-box protein, which is responsible for substrate recognition. Recent crystallographic analysis has confirmed a wealth of genetic and biochemical evidence by demonstrating that the ∼40-amino acid F-box motif links the F-box protein with the common SCF components by binding Skp1p (6Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C.

Thus, SCF complexes define a family of E3 ligases that may be distinguished by a particular F-box protein, which in turn determines substrate specificity for that complex. The different complexes are designated according to the variable F-box component (e.g. SCFMet30p contains the Met30p F-box protein). SCF complexes were initially described in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and it is in this organism that some of the most extensive analysis on SCF complexes has been performed. As with other organisms, yeast contains multiple F-box proteins including Cdc4p, Grr1p, and Met30p, which have been demonstrated to form SCF complexes. These complexes may recognize multiple substrates and play key roles in controlling the abundance of cell division cycle regulators and transcription factors that coordinate cellular responses to environmental changes (reviewed in Ref. 4Craig K.L. Tyers M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 299-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).

MET genes encode transporters and enzymes necessary for the uptake of sulfate and its assimilation to methionine and cysteine.

Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), how Met30p enters the nucleus has not been determined. Additionally, the processes required for an F-box protein to be assimilated in an SCF complex are unknown. To address how F-box proteins are targeted to the desired subcellular location and are assembled into an SCF complex, we have mapped regions on Met30p that are required for these processes. Here, we show that the amino-terminal portion of Met30p, including the F-box motif, mediates Met30p nuclear localization and association with core SCF components. However, these processes appear to be independent of each other.

DNA fragments corresponding to a 3′-portion of MET30 containing L187D and E190A point mutations were made by PCR in which the primer annealing at the 3′ end contained the desired mutation. The PCR product generated from primers MET30-1a and MET30-8b as well as MET30-1a and MET30-10b were restricted with XbaI and BglII and ligated into pGST-Met30(180–640) that had been restricted with the same enzymes. This generated pGST-MET30(1–640)(L187D) and pGST-MET30(1–640)(E190A), respectively. For pGST-Met30(Δ161–169), primers annealing to the 5′ and 3′ end of Met30(1–161)p were designed to incorporate an XbaI and SphI/SalI restriction enzyme site, respectively. pRS316-Met30(1–161)p was generated by PCR using primers Mt30-1a and 5′-tttgtcgacgcatgctaggatcccatccagaatcag-3′. The PCR product was cleaved with the appropriate enzymes and ligated into pRS316, which had been previously digested with the same enzymes to generate pRS316-Met30(1–161)p.

Upon ligation, the resulting plasmid, called pRS316-Met-30(Δ161–169)p, was used as a template for pEG(KG), pGFP, and two hybrid vectors. For pGSTMet30(S163N/Q167R/S169P)p, primers annealing to the 5′ and 3′ end of Met30(161–640)p were designed to incorporate a BamHI and SalI restriction site, respectively. A PCR product was generated using 5′-gatgggatcctatcgacgaattgcttcccacggcttccctacatttcgtcactcgttac-3′, which incorporated three point mutations (S163N, Q167R, and S169P) and primer Mt30-2b (Table I). The PCR product was cleaved with the appropriate enzymes and ligated into pRS316-Met30(1–161)p, which had been previously digested with the same enzymes. Upon ligation, the resulting plasmid, called pRS316-Mt30-TM2, was used as a template for pEG(KG), pGFP, and two hybrid vectors. GFP constructs were made as follows. The GFP-encoding gene was amplified using primers 5′-cccgaattcatgagtaaaggagaagaacttttc-3′ and 5′-aaaggatcctttgtatagttcatccatgccatg-3′, which anneal to 5′ and 3′ ends of GFP respectively. These primers contained EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites, and these enzymes were used to restrict the PCR product and pHY314 (kindly provided by Steve Elledge). Upon ligation, the resulting plasmid, called pHY314-GFP, contained GFP downstream of the GAL1 promoter. All other GFP constructs were generated as in-frame fusions with GFP using this plasmid. Plasmids pGFP-MET30(180–640), pGFP-MET30(227–640), and pGFP-MET30(300–640) were cloned by ligating BamHI-SacI fragments generated from the appropriate pEG(KG) construct into pHY314-GFP digested with the same enzymes. The remaining GFP-MET30 fusions were cloned by ligating XbaI and SacI PCR-generated fragments into pHY314-GFP digested with the same enzymes. Plasmids pGFP-Met30(Δ161–179), pGFP-Met30(E190A), and pGFP-Met30(L187D) were created using the primers used for the construction of pGFPMET30(1–640). Additionally a control GFP encoding plasmid was constructed that incorporated an in-frame stop codon. When transformed into yeast cells, this GFP construct was used to compare the fluorescence signals generated by the above constructs. Plasmids pGAD, pGBD, pACTII, and pAS1-CYH2 were used to generate constructs used for yeast two-hybrid analysis, and the primers and constructs used are listed in Tables I and II. The MET30-containing PCR fragments were either restricted with NcoI and SalI and ligated into pAS1-CYH, or restricted with NcoI and XhoI and ligated into pACTII, which were both treated with the same enzymes. The SKP1-containing PCR fragments were restricted with BamHI and SalI and ligated into pGAD and pGBD vectors treated with the same enzymes. For DNA sequencing, DNA was prepared according to Qiagen/Eppendorf kit specifications and sequencing was carried out by the Arizona State University sequencing facility. Microscopy and Photobleaching Analysis—Microscopic analysis of live cells expressing GFP fusions has been previously described (19Dixon C. Brunson L.E. Roy M.M. Smothers D. Sehorn M.G. Mathias N. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The fluorescence signal for each image was normalized with respect to that for the image of GFP fused to full-length Met30p. After images were captured, the GFP signal was analyzed numerically using IPLab software (version 3.2). Measurements of fluorescence signal from an area corresponding to the position of the nucleus and cytoplasm were taken for 30–60 cells, and measurements of background fluorescence were taken for each field of cells. The ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic signal was calculated after subtracting the background fluorescence from the nuclear and cytoplasmic values. Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) experiments were performed with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal microscope (25-milliwatt argon laser, Nikon TE300, 100× plan apo objective; 1.4 numeric aperture). After induction of the GFP fusions, cells were placed in non-inducing media containing cycloheximide (1 mg/ml). Cells were placed on a pad of PBS containing 2% agarose under a coverslip. The cytoplasmic region to be bleached was centered in the field, and a circular region (∼1 μm in diameter) was then bleached at high laser power (usually 20% power) without scan. Samples were repeatedly imaged and bleached 15 times at 5-s intervals. Images were acquired at 3% laser power. Image analysis was performed using the IPLab Spectrum software (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). The signal of the background was subtracted from all measurements. To eliminate the bleaching factor resulting from repetitive exposures, the values measured for the target cell were presented as the percentage of the signal measured for the corresponding area (cytoplasm or nucleus) of the non-bleached reference cell. The percentage of the signal corresponding to either the cytoplasm or the nucleus was plotted against the number of bleachings. Protein Preparation and Western Immunoblot Techniques—Yeast lysate preparations and Western immunoblot techniques were carried out as described previously (27Mathias N. Steussy C.N. Goebl M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4040-4045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Antibodies against GST and MYC were purchased from Sigma, and antibodies raised against HA epitope were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-Skp1p antibodies were a generous gift from Dorota Skowyra. For GST pull-downs, cells were lysed in 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA. 1 mg of protein was incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. Precipitated protein was subjected to Western immunoblot analysis as previously described (28Lammer D. Mathias N. Laplaza J.M. Jiang W. Liu Y. Callis J. Goebl M.G. Estelle M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 914-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The Amino Terminus of Met30p Mediates Nuclear Localization—Using a variety of software programs, a recognizable nuclear localization sequence was not found in Met30p. Thus, to further map the region that mediates its proper localization, we created a series of GFP fusion constructs containing various portions of Met30p and determined their location in live cells using fluorescence microscopy. The signal generated by GFP not fused to any Met30p sequence was observed to be present throughout the cell (Fig. 1). In contrast, the signal generated by most members of a panel of GFP-Met30p fusions exhibited an increase in nuclear concentration (Fig. 1). By quantifying the intensity of fluorescence emitted from the cytoplasm and nucleus, we were able to evaluate the relative ability of each construct to be properly localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1). The efficiency of nuclear localization of full-length Met30p was equivalent to that of a fusion containing the amino terminus of Met30p, GFP-Met30(1–299)p. In contrast, fusions containing the carboxyl terminus of Met30p commencing at either residue 300 or residue 409 were poorly localized to the nucleus. Thus, sequences within the amino-terminal half of the protein are necessary and sufficient for proper Met30p localization. To determine more precisely the portion of the amino terminus required for proper nuclear localization, additional constructs were made. GFP-Met30(1–277)p and GFP-Met30(1–180)p displayed a decrease in the efficiency of nuclear localization compared with GFP-Met30(1–299)p. Additionally, fusions containing truncations in the amino terminus, GFP-Met30(180–640)p and GFP-Met30(50–640)p, also localized to the nucleus poorly. Together, these data indicate that sequences throughout the amino terminus of Met30p are important for mediating Met30p nuclear localization and these sequences are bound between residues 1 and 299. The F-box Motif, but Not Skp1p, Plays an Important Role in Met30p Nuclear Localization—We next attempted to identify residues within the amino terminus that mediate Met30p nuclear localization. Previously, we have demonstrated that overproduction of a polypeptide corresponding to the amino terminus of Met30p (residues 1–225) acts in a dominant negative fashion by specifically inhibiting the SCFMet30p complex (19Dixon C. Brunson L.E. Roy M.M. Smothers D. Sehorn M.G. Mathias N. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We had also generated mutants of this allele that had lost dominant negative activity. Thus, this collection of mutants was exploited toward identifying residues within this fragment of Met30p that are important for nuclear localization. Mutations upstream of the F-box, in residues 163, 167, and 169, had a modest effect on the localization of GFP-Met30(1–225)p (Fig. 2A). In contrast, versions of Met30(1–225)p containing mutations within the F-box, P188L, P188S, and C211Y, displayed a more pronounced defect in localization than those versions containing mutations upstream of the F-box (Fig. 2A). Thus, in the context of the truncated version used in this assay, the integrity of the F-box motif appears to be important for Met30p localization. Because the F-box is a binding site for Skp1p, we wished to determine whether nuclear localization of the different versions of Met30(1–225)p correlated with their ability to bind Skp1p. As expected, GST-Met30(1–225)(P188L)p, GST-Met30(1–225)(P188S)p, and GST-Met30(1–225)(C211Y)p, which contain mutations in the F-box, failed to associate with Skp1p as determined by co-precipitation analysis (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, the remaining versions of Met30(1–225)p that contain mutations upstream of the F-box also failed to interact with Skp1p (Fig. 3A). Thus, although mutations in the F-box motif affect the nuclear localization of GFP-Met30(1–225)p, the association of Skp1p does not appear to influence this process.Fig. 3Mutations within and upstream of the F-box of Met30p affect its ability to bind Skp1p. A and B, co-precipitation analysis of different GST fusions with Skp1p. Lysate prepared from cells producing the indicated GST fusion were subjected either to Western immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibody or incubated in the presence of glutathione resin. Proteins immobilized to the resin were subjected to Western immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibody. C, two-hybrid analysis of Met30p constructs. Patches of PJ69-4A cells transformed with the indicated constructs fused to either the GAL4 binding domain (BD) or activation domain (AD) were replica-plated onto media lacking adenine and incubated for 4 days at 30 °C. D, PY283 (mt30-6) transformed with plasmids expressing the indicated GST fusion were plated onto YPD media and incubated at either 23 or 37 °C for 3 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We tested whether mutations in the F-box of the full-length protein would result in its mis-localization. We generated versions of Met30p, Met30(Ll87D)p and Met30(E190A)p, that contain point mutations in residues that are highly conserved within the F-box motif. As expected, these versions failed to complement a mt30-6 temperature-sensitive mutation (data not shown) and failed to interact with Skp1p as determined by co-precipitation and two-hybrid analyses (Fig. 3, B and C). Further, such versions displayed decreased efficiency in nuclear localization compared with wild type (Fig. 1). We next explored whether the activity of core SCF components is important for Met30p localization. In cells containing the skp1–12 temperature-sensitive mutation not only is SKP1 activity compromised but Skp1–12p association with F-box proteins is undetectable (14Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Sa D. Kuras L. Thomas D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 692-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In skp1–12 cells incubated at the permissive or nonpermissive temperature, Met30p localized to the nucleus with equivalent efficiency (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar results were obtained for strains containing temperature-sensitive mutations in CDC53 and CDC34 (Fig. 2B). Thus, although the Met30p F-box motif plays an important part in Met30p localization, this process is independent of Skp1p and of other SCF core components. Homo-multimerization Is Not Required for Met30p Nuclear Localization—We have previously demonstrated that Met30p residues 1–225 but not 1–180 interact with full-length Met30p (19Dixon C. Brunson L.E. Roy M.M. Smothers D. Sehorn M.G. Mathias N. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to test whether homo-multimerization mediated M"

Using a cell-free system we show that hypersensitivity does not simply correlate with the number of DNA-bound proteins. Specifically, the leucine zipper containing basic helix-loop-helix protein TFE3 was sufficient to induce a DNase I-hypersensitive site at the immunoglobulin heavy chain μ enhancer in vitro. TFE3 enhanced binding of an ETS protein PU.1 to the enhancer. However, PU.1 binding erased the DNase I-hypersensitive site without abolishing TFE3 binding. Furthermore, TFE3 binding enhanced transcription in the presence and absence of a hypersensitive site, whereas endonuclease accessibility correlated strictly with DNase I hypersensitivity. We infer that chromatin constraints for transcription and nuclease sensitivity can differ.

Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene expression is regulated by the μ enhancer that is located in the intron between the VDJH and Cμ exons (1Gillies S.D. Morrison S.L. Oi V.T. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1983; 33: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 2Banerji J. Olson L. Schaffner W. Cell. 1983; 33: 729-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). This enhancer is necessary for expression of rearranged IGH genes in transgenic mice (3Jenuwein T. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 932-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and sufficient to confer B lymphocyte-specific transcription in transfection and transgenic assays (4Adams J.M. Harris A.W.

This activity was first demonstrated in artificial recombination substrates (8Ferrier P. Krippl B. Blackwell T.K. Furley A.J. Suh H. Winoto A. Cook W.D. Hood L. Costantini F. Alt F.W.

Med. 1994; 180: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and has recently been confirmed by deleting the element from the endogenous locus (11Chen J. Young F. Bottaro A. Stewart V. Smith R.K. Alt F.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4635-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 12Serwe M. Sablitzky F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2321-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 13Sakai E. Bottaro A. Davidson L. Sleckman B.P. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1526-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Multiple DNA-binding proteins determine the properties of the enhancer. At least 15 different μ enhancer-binding proteins have been identified, most of which appear to contribute to enhancer activity to varying degrees (14Nelsen B. Sen R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 133: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Ernst P. Smale S.T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 427-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). μ enhancer-binding proteins can be broadly classified into two categories: those whose expression is tissue restricted and those that are widely expressed. Even among the tissue-restricted proteins, there are none whose expression profile coincides precisely with those cells in which the IGH gene is expressed. For example, PU.1, which is the most tissue-restricted μ enhancer-binding protein that interacts with the μB site of the enhancer, is expressed in both B cells and macrophages (16Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Yet, the IGH gene is not expressed in macrophages. The sequence CANNTGG is the most repeated element in the μ enhancer. This motif binds the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription factors that are typically expressed in most cell types. E2A proteins bind to two of five such elements (17Henthorn P. Kiledjian M. Kadesch T. Science. 1990; 247: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 18Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1156-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and TFE3/USF (basic helix-loop-helix-zip) proteins bind to another (19Beckmann H. Su L.K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 20Roman C. Matera A.G. Cooper C. Artandi S. Blain S. Ward D.C. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 817-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in one of the earliest examples of in vivo footprinting these were the only elements shown to be protein-bound in B cells (21Ephrussi A. Church G.M. Tonegawa S. Gilbert W. Science. 1985; 227: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 22Church G.M. Ephrussi A. Gilbert W. Tonegawa S. Nature. 1985; 313: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The basis for tissue-specific DNA binding by apparently ubiquitously expressed proteins remains an enigma. It is clear that none of these elements by themselves generate enhancer activity in transient transfection assays into B cells, or non-B cells. Rather, the function of the μ enhancer is determined by combinatorial control: the combined action of tissue-restricted and ubiquitously expressed proteins, which cannot be predicted from the individual activities. The smallest functional domain of the enhancer, μ70, contains three protein binding sites: μA, μB, and μE3. These sites bind the proteins Ets-1, PU.1, and TFE3, respectively (23Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The μ70 enhancer mimics several important properties of the full enhancer (23Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 24Erman B. Sen R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4565-4575Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Rao E. Dang W. Tian G. Sen R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). First, this tripartite enhancer activates transcription in B cells, but not in several non-lymphoid cells or T cells. Second, the three proteins that bind to this enhancer exemplify tissue-restricted as well as ubiquitously distributed proteins. Third, enhancer activity in transient, or stable, transfection assays require all three sites to be intact, indicating that its function is the result of combinatorial mechanisms. Transcription activity generated by endogenous factors in B cells can be mimicked in non-lymphoid cells by ectopic co-expression of the tissue-restricted Ets-1 and PU.1 proteins. In such assays, mutation of the third (μE3) site abolishes transcriptional activity suggesting that the enhancer recruits a cellular factor to the μE3 site (23Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Unlike the full enhancer, however, the tripartite enhancer activates transcription in macrophages (27Nikolajczyk B.S. Cortes M. Feinman R. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3527-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The distinction in μ enhancer activity between B cells and macrophages, both of which express PU.1, is an interesting example of the acquisition of greater tissue specificity with increased numbers of enhancer-binding proteins. Like most characterized regulatory sequences, the μ enhancer is marked by a tissue-specific DNase I-hypersensitive site in cellular chromatin (28Mills F.C. Fisher L.M. Kuroda R. Ford A.M. Gould H.J. Nature. 1983; 306: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Ford A.M. Watt S.M. Furley A.J. Molgaard H.V. Greaves M.F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The μ enhancer-hypersensitive site is re-created in IgH transgenic mice and is strongest when neighboring matrix attachment regions are included in the transgene (30Forrester W.C. van Genderen C. Jenuwein T. Grosschedl R. Science. 1994; 265: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 31Jenuwein T. Forrester W.C. Fernandez-Herrero L.A. Laible G. Dull M. Grosschedl R. Nature. 1997; 385: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In model systems transcription factor binding is important in initiating chromatin structure changes (32Tsukiyama T. Becker P.B. Wu C. Nature. 1994; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 33Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), as well as maintaining chromatin structure (35Pazin M.J. Bhargava P. Geiduschek E.P. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1997; 276: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Using Xenopus egg extracts to assemble chromatin we previously showed that the μB-binding protein PU.1 increases restriction enzyme accessibility to sites close to the enhancer (36Nikolajczyk B.S. Sanchez J.A. Sen R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 11-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of PU.1 induces sterile μ transcripts and restriction enzyme access to the endogenous IGH locus in pro-T cells. Overall, these studies show that the μ enhancer is sufficient to alter chromatin structure, a feature that is likely to form the basis of its function as a transcription and recombination enhancer. We present an analysis of chromatin remodeling mediated by the μ70 domain of the IGH enhancer. Of the three proteins that bind to this enhancer, TFE3 alone was sufficient to induce a DNase I-hypersensitive site, endonuclease accessibility, positioning of nucleosomes adjacent to the enhancer, and transcriptional activation on chromatin templates in vitro. PU.1, an ETS protein, was recruited to chromatin by TFE3. Surprisingly, PU.1 binding abolished TFE3-induced DNase I hypersensitivity and endonuclease accessibility without affecting TFE3 binding or TFE3-induced nucleosome positioning. In contrast to its effects on chromatin structure, PU.1 had little if any effect on TFE3-activated transcription in vitro, suggesting that the requirements for nuclease accessibility and transcription are different. These observations suggest that occupancy of multiple sites and nucleosome positioning are not sufficient to generate DNase I hypersensitivity. Thus, important regulatory events may be mediated by DNA-bound proteins that are not marked by hypersensitivity to DNase I. Plasmids—μ70 dimer constructs (wt, μB-, μE3-) have been described (23Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The μA-μB- construct that contains mutations in both the μA site (GCAGGAAGCA → GCATCGAGCA) and μB site (TTTGGGGAA → CCCGGGGAA) was made as follows. The μ170 fragment containing the μB- mutation (23Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R.

The PCR product was digested with AluI and inserted into the SalI site of the Δ56 chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid (37Gilman M.Z. Wilson R.N. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell.

The His-PU.1 expression vector was constructed by inserting the BamHI-EcoRI fragment from the GST-PU expression vector (25Rao E. Dang W. Tian G. Sen R. J. Biol.

Recombinant Proteins—Ets-1 was expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein. The GST-Ets-1 protein was expressed in bacteria and purified using glutathione affinity resin following the manufacturer's specifications. Purified GST-Ets-1 was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl). TFE3 and PU.1 were expressed in bacteria as His6-tagged proteins and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography followed by DNA affinity chromatography.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and after annealing and ligation were coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). For the PU.1 affinity columns, oligonucleotides with sequences 5′-pCTTCTTCAAGTTCCTCTTCCCCTTCCCCA-3′ and 5′-pGφIAGTGGGGAAGGGGAAGAGGAACTTGAA-3′ were synthesized and processed in the same way. Bacterial cells expressing His-TFE3 were re-suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by incubation with lysozyme followed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) and eluted stepwise by imidazole. The purified protein was dialyzed against 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, loaded onto a DNA affinity column, and was eluted stepwise with the same buffer containing variable KCl concentrations. The purified TFE3 was dialyzed against buffer D. His-PU.1 was initially purified by a nickel affinity column under denaturing condition. Bacterial cells expressing His-PU.1 were re-suspended in 8 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin and eluted stepwise with imidazole. The fractions containing PU.1 were diluted into 8 m urea, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and the protein was renatured by stepwise dialysis against the same buffer containing 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0 m urea. The renatured protein was passed through a filter with a pore size of 0.45 μm and was applied to a DNA affinity column. The protein was eluted stepwise by variable KCl. The purified PU.1 was dialyzed against 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Chromatin Assembly—Chromatin was assembled with plasmid DNA, Drosophila core histones, and S-190 assembly extract derived from Drosophila embryos, essentially as described previously (39Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 173-194Google Scholar). The ratio of core histones to DNA was varied between 0.7 and 1:1 (w/w) to attain complete assembly. Nuclease Analysis—Micrococcal nuclease digestion of chromatin was done essentially as described (39Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 173-194Google Scholar). Micrococcal nuclease was diluted in buffer R (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 30 mm CaCl2 to 5, 1.3, or 0.4 units/ml. 25 μl of chromatin aliquots (containing 125 ng of DNA) were digested with 2.5 μl of the diluted micrococcal nuclease for 10 min at room temperature and the reaction was terminated by addition of 2.5 μl of stop solution (6 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml RNase A). The samples were de-proteinized by proteinase K digestion, extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and precipitated with ethanol. DNA from chromatin treated with 2.5 μl of 1.3 and 5 units/ml of micrococcal nuclease was fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel, and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Fractionated DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe specific to an enhancer proximal region (5′-TGCAGTCGCGGTTGGAGTAGTAGGCGC-3′). The same membrane was stripped and re-hybridized to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe specific to an enhancer distal region (5′-TGCCAGTGGCGATAAGTCGTGTCTTACCG-3′). DNase I digestion of chromatin was done essentially as described in Ref. 39Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 173-194Google Scholar. 25-μl Chromatin aliquots (125 ng of DNA) were digested with 2.5 μl of (80 μg/ml) DNase I for 1 min at room temperature and the reaction was terminated by addition of 2.5 μl of stop solution. The samples were de-proteinized by proteinase K digestion, extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and precipitated with ethanol. 50 ng of DNA was used for footprinting assay by primer extension with Vent (exo-) polymerase and a 32P-labeled primer (5′-TGCAGTCGCGGTTGGAGTAGTAGGCGC-3′). The samples were then analyzed by electrophoresis through 6% denaturing gels followed by autoradiography. Indirect End Labeling Analysis—The chromatin samples digested with DNase I or micrococcal nuclease (2.5 μl of 0.4 units/ml) were also analyzed by indirect end labeling analysis. 50 ng of DNA from the DNase I- or micrococcal nuclease-treated samples was linearized by treatment with AlwNI. The DNA was separated in a 1.2% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane, which was hybridized to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (5′-TGCCAGTGGCGATAAGTCGTGTCTTACCG-3′). Restriction Enzyme Accessibility—10-μl Chromatin (50 ng DNA) samples were aliquoted and 1 μl of 25 mm MgCl2 was added to each. HincII (New England Biolabs, 10 units/μl) was diluted to 1:10, 1:30, 1:100, and 1:300 in Buffer R. 1 μl of diluted HincII was added to each sample. Samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Digestion was stopped by addition of 1.5 μl of stop solution. The samples were de-proteinized with proteinase K, extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and the DNA was precipitated. The DNA was digested with AlwNI and analyzed by indirect end labeling as described above. In Vitro Transcription—Chromatin was transcribed with a Drosophila nuclear extract, as described previously (39Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 173-194Google Scholar). 35 μl of a mixture containing buffer, ribonucleoside triphosphates, and the extract was added to duplicate aliquots of chromatin (15 μl volume, each containing 75 ng of DNA) and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The transcripts were detected by reverse transcriptase primer extension analysis using the primer 5′-TAGCTCCTGAAAATCTCGAAGCTCTAG-3′. The data were quantitated with a phosphorimager. The template used in these studies contains two copies of the μ70 domain of the immunoglobulin heavy chain μ enhancer cloned 5′ to a TATA-containing c-fos gene promoter and a chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase gene (Fig. 1A). This plasmid is transcriptionally active in transiently transfected B cells and macrophages, but not in several other cell types (23Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Transcription activity requires all three binding sites in μ70, indicating that its tissue-restricted activity is the result of combinatorial mechanisms. We assembled this plasmid into chromatin using Drosophila embryo extracts (39Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 173-194Google Scholar, 40Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Adolph K.W. Methods in Molecular Genetics. 5. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 241-262Google Scholar), followed by incubation with μ70-binding proteins, PU.1, Ets-1, and TFE3, in various combinations. Thereafter, aliquots were removed for digestion with DNase I, micrococcal nuclease, or a restriction endonuclease for structural studies, or further incubated with nuclear extracts to assay transcription (Fig. 1B). Efficient chromatin assembly was evident from agarose gel analysis of micrococcal nuclease-treated DNA followed by staining with ethidium bromide (Fig. 1C). No gross nucleosomal perturbation was evident when the nucleosomal plasmids were further incubated with transcription factors prior to micrococcal nuclease digestion (Fig. 1C, lanes 3-16). Furthermore, Southern hybridization with an enhancer-proximal probe also did not reveal local changes in micrococcal nuclease digestion by the transcription factors (Fig. 1D). TFE3 Binds Chromatin and Recruits PU.1—Factor binding to DNA templates was assayed by DNase I footprinting using primer extension (39Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Gould H. Chromatin: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 173-194Google Scholar). Full-length Ets-1, TFE3, and PU.1 were expressed in bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography. Each protein bound to naked DNA and produced a characteristic pattern of protections and enhancements. Ets-1 binding to μA, although weak because of autoinhibition (41Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), was evident from the protection of several bands (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8, indicated by open arrows). PU.1 binding to μB induced prominent enhancement of DNase I cleavage (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8, indicated by solid arrows), and TFE3 produced a footprint over the μE3 site that extended into the Ets-1 binding μA site (Fig. 2, lanes 5-8, indicated by solid lines). There was no significant difference in the footprints whether each protein was added alone, or in combination with other proteins. We also examined factor binding to chromatin. Of the three proteins, only TFE3 bound to chromatin by itself to produce a clear footprint (Fig. 2, lane 13). In addition to the protection pattern seen with naked DNA, TFE3 binding to chromatin also generated two regions of enhanced DNase I cleavage (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 2, lane 13). PU.1 bound weakly to chromatin plasmid as shown by a slight increase in the intensity of the bands indicated by the solid arrows (Fig. 2, compare lanes 11 and 12 to 9 and 10). At the concentration used, Ets-1 binding was not evident by itself (Fig. 2, lane 10). TFE3 significantly increased PU.1 binding, which was apparent by prominent enhancement of the bands marked by the solid arrows (Fig. 2, compare lanes 15 and 16 to 11 and 12). In addition, enhanced DNase I cleavage induced by TFE3 alone (marked by asterisks) was reduced because of PU.1 binding. When Ets-1 was added in addition to TFE3, some protection of bands around the μA site (marked by open arrows) was observed, indicating weak Ets-1 binding (Fig. 2, compare lanes 14 and 16 to lane 13). Because these bands are weak to begin with in the absence of TFE3, it is not clear whether Ets-1 binding was enhanced by the presence of TFE3, or Ets-1 binding was simply not detectable in the absence of TFE3. Note also that similar protection around the μA site was observed when PU.1 was added together with TFE3, suggesting weak binding of PU.1 to μA site (Fig. 2, compare lane 15 to 13) (25Rao E. Dang W. Tian G. Sen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6722-6732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Enhanced PU.1, or Ets-1, binding in the presence of TFE3 was also observed when the template DNA was preincubated with these proteins prior to chromatin assembly (data not shown), suggesting that these ETS proteins do not bind stably to the nucleosomal μ enhancer without help; we surmise that pre-bound ETS proteins in these studies were displaced by subsequent nucleosome assembly. We have previously shown that Ets-1 binding to naked DNA is enhanced by TFE3, probably because of direct interactions between the two proteins that reduces the effect of the autoinhibitory domain of Ets-1 (26Tian G. Erman B. Ishii H. Gangopadhyay S.S. Sen R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, PU.1 and TFE3 do not bind cooperatively to naked DNA. Thus, the enhancement of PU.1 binding seen here is chromatin-specific, perhaps caused by alterations in chromatin structure induced by TFE3. It has been observed that binding of transcription factors within a nucleosome can be cooperative, even if binding of the same transcription factors to naked DNA is not inherently cooperative (42Adams C.C. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 44Miller J.A. Widom J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1623-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). TFE3 Induces DNase I Hypersensitivity and Nucleosome Positioning—To investigate the effects of these proteins on chromatin structure, nuclease sensitivity of the same chromatin used for footprinting was analyzed using indirect end labeling. The chromatin was treated with either DNase I or micrococcal nuclease, de-proteinized, restricted, and assayed by Southern blotting. Location of the restriction sites and the probes used are shown in Fig. 3A. As expected from the footprinting studies, DNase I digestion revealed no obvious perturbations with PU.1, Ets-1, or the two together (Fig. 3B, lanes 2-4). However, TFE3 binding generated a DNase I-hypersensitive site (marked by an arrow, Fig. 3B, lane 5) whose location coincided closely with μ enhancer sequences in the plasmid. In addition, at least two other DNase I cleavage sites were detected that flanked the μ enhancer and its associated hypersensitive site (Fig. 3B, marked by asterisks). The spacing of these sites (∼190 bp) suggested that they were because of positioned nucleosomes flanking the enhancer. Similar results were obtained with micrococcal nuclease (see below). Thus, TFE3 binding induced a DNase I-hypersensitive site and nucleosome positioning. Combinatorial Control of Chromatin Structure—We next examined the ability of combinations of enhancer-binding proteins to change chromatin structure. Addition of Ets-1 did not change the DNase I-hypersensitive site induced by TFE3 alone (Fig. 3B, lane 6). Unexpectedly, DNase I hypersensitivity disappeared when PU.1 was present in addition to TFE3, regardless of whether Ets-1 was, or was not, present in the reaction (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 8). Our footprinting data demonstrated that TFE3 remained bound to the enhancer in the presence of PU.1, or both PU.1 and Ets-1 (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). Thus, PU.1 did not erase DNase I hypersensitivity by antagonizing TFE3 binding. These observations demonstrate that DNase I hypersensitivity did not simply parallel the number of proteins bound to DNA. Specifically, maximal hypersensitivity was observed with two TFE3 sites occupied; this was not enhanced by addit"
