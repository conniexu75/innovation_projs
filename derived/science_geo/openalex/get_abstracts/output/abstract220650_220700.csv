https://openalex.org/W2067004457,"In conjunction with histone modifications, DNA methylation plays critical roles in gene silencing through chromatin remodeling. Changes in DNA methylation perturb neuronal function, and mutations in a methyl-CpG-binding protein, MeCP2, are associated with Rett syndrome. We report that increased synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in neurons after depolarization correlates with a decrease in CpG methylation within the regulatory region of the Bdnf gene. Moreover, increased Bdnf transcription involves dissociation of the MeCP2-histone deacetylase-mSin3A repression complex from its promoter. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation-related chromatin remodeling is important for activity-dependent gene regulation that may be critical for neural plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2035090622,"Mutations in MeCP2 , which encodes a protein that has been proposed to function as a global transcriptional repressor, are the cause of Rett syndrome (RT T), an X-linked progressive neurological disorder. Although the selective inactivation of MeCP2 in neurons is sufficient to confer a Rett-like phenotype in mice, the specific functions of MeCP2 in postmitotic neurons are not known. We find that MeCP2 binds selectively to BDNF promoter III and functions to repress expression of the BDNF gene. Membrane depolarization triggers the calcium-dependent phosphorylation and release of MeCP2 from BDNF promoter III, thereby facilitating transcription. These studies indicate that MeCP2 plays a key role in the control of neuronal activity–dependent gene regulation and suggest that the deregulation of this process may underlie the pathology of RT T."
https://openalex.org/W2147170044,"Functional analysis of a genome requires accurate gene structure information and a complete gene inventory. A dual experimental strategy was used to verify and correct the initial genome sequence annotation of the reference plant Arabidopsis. Sequencing full-length cDNAs and hybridizations using RNA populations from various tissues to a set of high-density oligonucleotide arrays spanning the entire genome allowed the accurate annotation of thousands of gene structures. We identified 5817 novel transcription units, including a substantial amount of antisense gene transcription, and 40 genes within the genetically defined centromeres. This approach resulted in completion of approximately 30% of the Arabidopsis ORFeome as a resource for global functional experimentation of the plant proteome."
https://openalex.org/W2000966016,"The mechanisms involved in prion neurotoxicity are unclear, and therapies preventing accumulation of PrP Sc , the disease-associated form of prion protein (PrP), do not significantly prolong survival in mice with central nervous system prion infection. We found that depleting endogenous neuronal PrP c in mice with established neuroinvasive prion infection reversed early spongiform change and prevented neuronal loss and progression to clinical disease. This occurred despite the accumulation of extraneuronal PrP Sc to levels seen in terminally ill wild-type animals. Thus, the propagation of nonneuronal PrP Sc is not pathogenic, but arresting the continued conversion of PrP c to PrP Sc within neurons during scrapie infection prevents prion neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2117926449,"Because of its requirement for signaling by multiple cytokines, Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) is an excellent target for clinical immunosuppression. We report the development of a specific, orally active inhibitor of JAK3, CP-690,550, that significantly prolonged survival in a murine model of heart transplantation and in cynomolgus monkeys receiving kidney transplants. CP-690,550 treatment was not associated with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or lymphoproliferative disease. On the basis of these preclinical results, we believe JAK3 blockade by CP-690,550 has potential for therapeutically desirable immunosuppression in human organ transplantation and in other clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2065857393,"We often think of neurodevelopmental disorders as beginning before birth, and many certainly do. A handful, however, strike many months after birth, following a period of apparently normal growth and development. Autism and Rett syndrome are two such disorders, and here I consider some of their similarities at the phenotypic and pathogenic levels. I propose that both disorders result from disruption of postnatal or experience-dependent synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2017018649,"In the mouse olfactory system, each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) expresses only one odorant receptor (OR) gene in a monoallelic and mutually exclusive manner. Such expression forms the genetic basis for OR-instructed axonal projection of OSNs to the olfactory bulb of the brain during development. Here, we identify an upstream cis-acting DNA region that activates the OR gene cluster in mouse and allows the expression of only one OR gene within the cluster. Deletion of the coding region of the expressed OR gene or a naturally occurring frame-shift mutation allows a second OR gene to be expressed. We propose that stochastic activation of only one OR gene within the cluster and negative feedback regulation by that OR gene product are necessary to ensure the one receptor-one neuron rule."
https://openalex.org/W2035736338,"The Arabidopsis autonomous floral-promotion pathway promotes flowering independently of the photoperiod and vernalization pathways by repressing FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ), a MADS-boxtranscription factor that blocks the transition from vegetative to reproductive development. Here, we report that FLOWERING LOCUS D ( FLD ), one of sixgenes in the autonomous pathway, encodes a plant homolog of a protein found in histone deacetylase complexes in mammals. Lesions in FLD result in hyperacetylation of histones in FLC chromatin, up-regulation of FLC expression, and extremely delayed flowering. Thus, the autonomous pathway regulates flowering in part by histone deacetylation. However, not all autonomous-pathway mutants exhibit FLC hyperacetylation, indicating that multiple means exist by which this pathway represses FLC expression."
https://openalex.org/W2150562868,"The collared lemming in the high-Arctic tundra in Greenland is preyed upon by four species of predators that show marked differences in the numbers of lemmings each consumes and in the dependence of their dynamics on lemming density. A predator prey model based on the field-estimated predator responses robustly predicts 4-year periodicity in lemming dynamics, in agreement with long-term empirical data. There is no indication in the field that food or space limits lemming population growth, nor is there need in the model to consider those factors. The cyclic dynamics are driven by a 1-year delay in the numerical response of the stoat and stabilized by strongly density-dependent predation by the arctic fox, the snowy owl, and the long-tailed skua."
https://openalex.org/W2079972888,"When a liquid is cooled below its melting temperature, it usually crystallizes. However, if the quenching rate is fast enough, the system may remain in a disordered state, progressively losing its fluidity upon further cooling. When the time needed for the rearrangement of the local atomic structure reaches approximately 100 seconds, the system becomes ""solid"" for any practical purpose, and this defines the glass transition temperature Tg. Approaching this transition from the liquid side, different systems show qualitatively different temperature dependencies of the viscosity, and accordingly they have been classified by introducing the concept of ""fragility."" We report experimental observations that relate the microscopic properties of the glassy phase to the fragility. We find that the vibrational properties of the glass well below Tg are correlated with the fragility value. Consequently, we extend the fragility concept to the glassy state and indicate how to determine the fragility uniquely from glass properties well below Tg."
https://openalex.org/W2115365480,The retreat and collapse of Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves in tandem with a regional atmospheric warming has fueled speculation as to how these events may be related. Satellite radar altimeter measurements show that between 1992 and 2001 the Larsen Ice Shelf lowered by up to 0.27 +/- 0.11 meters per year. The lowering is explained by increased summer melt-water and the loss of basal ice through melting. Enhanced ocean-driven melting may provide a simple link between regional climate warming and the successive disintegration of sections of the Larsen Ice Shelf.
https://openalex.org/W1982429312,"We combine photonic and electronic band structure engineering to create a surface-emitting quantum cascade microcavity laser. A high-index contrast two-dimensional photonic crystal is used to form a micro-resonator that simultaneously provides feedback for laser action and diffracts light vertically from the surface of the semiconductor surface. A top metallic contact allows electrical current injection and provides vertical optical confinement through a bound surface plasmon wave. The miniaturization and tailorable emission properties of this design are potentially important for sensing applications, while electrical pumping can allow new studies of photonic crystal and surface plasmon structures in nonlinear and near-field optics."
https://openalex.org/W2015852392,"The Alpine Iceman provides a unique window into the Neolithic-Copper Age of Europe. We compared the radiogenic (strontium and lead) and stable (oxygen and carbon) isotope composition of the Iceman's teeth and bones, as well as 40Ar/39Ar mica ages from his intestine, to local geology and hydrology, and we inferred his habitat and range from childhood to adult life. The Iceman's origin can be restricted to a few valleys within approximately 60 kilometers south(east) of the discovery site. His migration during adulthood is indicated by contrasting isotopic compositions of enamel, bones, and intestinal content. This demonstrates that the Alpine valleys of central Europe were permanently inhabited during the terminal Neolithic."
https://openalex.org/W2021167468,"We describe a new molecular class of genetic-pairing system that has a native DNA backbone but has all four base pairs replaced by new, larger pairs. The base pairs include size-expanded analogs of thymine and of adenine, both extended by the width of a benzene ring (2.4 Å). The expanded-diameter double helices are more thermodynamically stable than the Watson-Crick helix, likely because of enhanced base stacking. Structural data confirm a right-handed, double-stranded, and base-paired helical form. Because of the larger base size, all the pairs of this helical system are fluorescent, which suggests practical applications in detection of natural DNA and RNA. Our findings establish that there is no apparent structural or thermodynamic prohibition against genetic systems having sizes different from the natural one."

https://openalex.org/W2016846235,"Disjunction of pairs of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division (MI) requires anaphase-promoting complex (APC)-mediated activation of separase in budding yeast1,2 and Caenorhabditis elegans3,4,5, but not Xenopus laevis6,7. It is not clear which model best fits the mammalian system. Here we show that homologue disjunction in mouse oocytes is dependent on proteolysis of the separase inhibitor securin and the Cdk1 regulatory sub-unit cyclin B1. Proteolysis of both proteins was entirely dependent on their conserved destruction box (D-box) motifs, through which they are targeted to the APC8. These data indicate that the mechanisms regulating homologue disjunction in mammalian oocytes are similar to those of budding yeast and C.elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2083666804,"Phospholipase D (PLD) and heterotrimeric G-protein both play important, diverse roles in cellular regulation and signal transduction. Here we have determined the physical interaction between plant PLD and the only canonical α-subunit (Gα) of the G-protein in Arabidopsis thaliana and the molecular basis for the interaction. PLDα1 expressed in either Escherichia coli or Arabidopsis was co-precipitated with Gα. PLDα1 contains a sequence motif analogous to the Gα-interacting DRY motif normally conserved in G-protein-coupled receptors. Mutation of the central Lys residue PLDK564A of this motif abolished the PLDα1-Gα binding, whereas mutation of the two flanking residues PLDE563A and PLDF565A decreased the binding. Addition of Gα to PLDα1 inhibited PLDα1 activity, whereas the PLDK564A mutation that disrupted the Gα-PLDα1 binding abolished the inhibition. GTP relieved the Gα inhibition of PLDα1 activity and also inhibited the binding between PLDα1 and Gα. Meanwhile, the PLDα1-Gα interaction stimulated the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα. Therefore, these results have demonstrated the direct binding between Gα and PLDα1, identified the DRY motif on PLDα1 as the site for the interaction, and indicated that the interaction modulates reciprocally the activities of PLDα1 and Gα.

Plant PLD comprises a family of enzymes with different regulatory properties (1.Wang X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Several Arabidopsis PLDs have been shown to display different requirements for Ca2+, polyphosphoinositides, and free fatty acids as well as varied substrate selectivity. Arabidopsis has at least 12 PLDs, of which PLDα1 is most prevalent and responsible for the common plant PLD activity (1.Wang X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2.Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). PLDα1 produces a majority of the phosphatic acid under several stress conditions, such as freezing and wounding (3.Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D.

Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2183-2196PubMed Google Scholar), decreased wound-induced accumulation of jasmonic acid (4.Wang C. Zien C. Afitlhile M. Welti R. Hildebrand D.F. Wang X. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and reactive oxygen generation (6.Sang Y. Cui D. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and increased freezing tolerance and water loss (3.Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B.

Plant J. 2001; 28: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These results show that the common plant PLD has multifaceted functions, including roles in metabolism and cell signaling, dependent on the nature and severity of the stress conditions. The Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins plays an important role in signal transduction. In animal systems, Gα interacts with the upstream transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and with the β-subunit. The binding of a ligand to a cognate receptor promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Gα, and the GTP-bound Gα activates the downstream effector proteins (8.Offermanns S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 101-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In addition, Gα may interact with nonreceptor proteins to mediate signaling (9.Cismowski M.J. Takesono A. Bernard M.L. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 2301-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain a number of Gαs that mediate many distinctive cellular functions (8.Offermanns S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 101-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In contrast, the number of Gαs is very limited in plants; Arabidopsis has only a single canonical Gα gene, GPA1 (10.Assmann S.M. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S355-S373Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11.Jones A.M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis Gα-null mutants are impaired in several cellular processes, including cell division, certain ABA signaling steps in guard cells, and germination behaviors in response to glucose and hormones (12.Wang X.Q. Ullah H. Jones A.M. Assmann S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 2070-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 13.Ullah H. Chen J.G. Wang S. Jones A.M.

Science. 2001; 292: 2066-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These changes indicate that Gα is involved in multiple cellular processes in plants and thus may interact with multiple effector proteins for different functions. The only protein reported to interact with Gα in Arabidopsis is the cupin-domain protein AtPirin, which interacts with a CCAAT box-binding transcriptional factor (15.Lapik Y.R. Kaufman L.S. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1578-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which plant Gα interacts with its targets and the function of the interaction are unknown. A role of G-proteins in regulating plant PLD has been proposed recently. Most of the studies have involved the use of potential G-protein activators and inhibitors, such as toxins, nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analogues, and alcohols (16.Munnik T. Arisz S.A. De Vrije T. Musgrave A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2197-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 17.Ritchie S. Gilroy S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In barley aleurone cells, a PLDα-like activity has been suggested to be associated with a G-protein on the plasma membrane to mediate ABA signaling (17.Ritchie S. Gilroy S. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Co-incubation of bacterially expressed tobacco PLDα with Gα decreased the PLDα activity (18.Lein W. Saalbach G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that ablation of either Gα or PLDα1 in Arabidopsis affects ABA-mediated stomatal movement and increases plant water loss (7.Sang Y. Zheng S. Li W. Huang B. Wang X. Plant J. 2001; 28: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 12.Wang X.Q. Ullah H. Jones A.M. Assmann S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 2070-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). These observations raise intriguing questions of whether PLDα1 and Gα directly interact with one another and, if so, what the molecular bases are for the interaction. Here we show that PLDα1 binds to Gα through a motif analogous to the DRY motif present in many GPCRs and that the binding modulates the activity of PLDα1 and Gα. Expression and Purification of Active Plant PLDα in Escherichia coli—Arabidopsis PLDα1 cDNA was cloned previously in pBlue SK (19.Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The 2.4-kb PLDα1 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector. The forward and reverse primers were 5′-GCGGATCCATGGCGCAGCATCTGTTGCACG and 5′-CGGAGCTCTTAGGTTGTAAGGATTGGAGGC, respectively, and the bold letters mark the inserted BamHI and SacI sites. The PLDα1 cDNA insert was digested with BamHI and SacI and ligated into the pET28(+)a vector to produce PLDα1 with 6 histidine residues fused at the N terminus. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Expression of PLDα1 was induced by 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 12 h. After induction, bacteria were precipitated and lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline plus 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated with Ni-affinity agarose beads for 1 h. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g at 4 °C and washed three times with a washing buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole at pH 8.0. PLDα1 bound to the resin was eluted with an elution buffer with 1 m imidazole, Tris-HCl, and 0.5 m NaCl. In some cases, PLDα1 bound to resins was used directly for assaying PLDα1 activity. Concentration of the purified PLDα1 was measured by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad kit with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. The protein was stored in 20% glycerol at –20 °C until use. Expression and Purification of Active Plant Gα in E. coli—An Arabidopsis Gα cDNA clone was generously provided by Dr. Hong Ma (Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA) (20.Ma H. Yanofsky M. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3821-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The 1.3-kb Gα cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector. The forward and reverse primers were 5′-GAATTCATGGGCTTACTCTGCAGTAGAA and 5′-CTCGAGTCATAAAAGGCCAGCCTCCAGTA, respectively, and the bold letters mark the inserted EcoRI and XhoI sites. The cDNA insert was digested with XhoI and EcoRI and ligated into pGEX-4T to produce Gα with glutathione S-transferase (GST) fused at the N terminus. Junction of the GST-GPA1 fusion and full-length cDNA of Gα was confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) to express the GST-fused Gα according to the procedure described previously (21.Pappan K. Zheng S. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of the DRY Motif in PLDα1—Mutagenesis of the three codons in the putative DRY motif of PLDα1 was performed using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The three complementary reverse primers for mutating E563A, K564A, and F565A were as follows: 5′-GATTGAGAAAGGAGCGAAGTTCAGGGTCTATGTTGTGG, 5′-GATTGAGAAAGGAGAGGCGTTCAGGGTCTATGTTGTGG, and 5′-GAGAAAGGAGAGAAGGCCAGGGTCTATGTTGTGG, respectively. The wild-type PLDα1 cDNA in pET28(+)a served as the PCR template. The mutant clones were verified by DNA sequencing and were then transformed into BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Expression and purification of the mutated PLDα1 proteins in E. coli were performed with the same procedure as that for the original PLDα1. Protein Extraction from Arabidopsis—Fully expanded leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia) plants were frozen with liquid N2 and homogenized with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 80 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, and the resultant supernatant was used as protein extracts for co-precipitation. Protein concentration in the supernatant was measured by the Bradford method using a Bio-Rad kit with BSA as a standard. PLDα Pulldown by GST-Gα-Agarose Beads and Immunoblotting— Purified GST-Gα-agarose beads were incubated with plant protein extracts; bacterially expressed PLDα1; or PLDα1 mutants in a co-precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors (5 μg each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and antipain) in a total volume of 150 μl. After incubation at 4 °C for 3 h, beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g and washed three times with the co-precipitation buffer containing 0.01% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. Pulldown beads were assayed for PLDα1 activity and/or were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to PLDα1. PLDα1 polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit against the 13 C-terminal amino acid residues as described previously (5.Fan L. Zheng S. Wang X. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2183-2196PubMed Google Scholar). PLD bands on blots were visualized by staining alkaline phosphatase activity conjugated to a second antibody (goat against rabbit immunoglobulin). The procedures for SDS-PAGE, protein blotting, and band detection were described previously (5.Fan L. Zheng S. Wang X. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 2183-2196PubMed Google Scholar). PLDα1 Activity Assays—PLD activity was assayed by using 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-phosphatidyl-[methyl-3H]choline as a substrate. Two different methods were used. One is the common plant PLD activity assay involving the use of phosphatidylcholine (PC), 25 mm Ca2+, and 0.3 mm SDS (22.Zheng L. Krishnamoorthi R. Zolkiewski M. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19700-19706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This assay is economical and specific for PLDα1 and thus was used for most PLDα1 assays unless otherwise stated. When the effect of Gα binding on PLD activity was measured, however, the presence of SDS and high levels of Ca2+ might have interfered with the PLD-Gα interaction. Thus, a second PLD assay was used, which contained mixed lipid vesicles composed of 3.6 μmol of phosphatidylethanolamine, 0.32 μmol of PIP2, and 0.22 μmol of PC in the presence of 100 μm CaCl2. This assay, referred to as the PC-PIP2 method, was performed according to a procedure described previously (23.Pappan K. Wang X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Assay of GTPase Activity of E. coli-expressed GPA1—GTPase activity assays were performed using the EnzChek® phosphate assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The rate of phosphate released from GTP by Gα was monitored spectrophotometrically at A360 nm according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the assay mixture contained different amounts of GST-Gα, 10 μl of 0.2 mm GTP or GTP at indicated concentrations, 0.2 ml of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleotide, 10 μl (1 unit) of purine nucleotide phosphorylase, and 0.72 ml of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 10 mm NaCl) in a total volume of 1 ml in a cuvette. After mixing, the reaction was started with addition of 10 mm MgCl2. Absorbance changes were recorded every 5 min. The amount of phosphate released from GTP was calculated based on a standard curve that was determined with known amounts of KPO4 in the same manner as described above. Gα Binds to PLDα1 Expressed in E. coli and Arabidopsis— Gα and PLDα1 were expressed in E. coli as GST-fused and His-tagged proteins, respectively (Fig. 1A). Both PLDα1 and Gα are catalytically active as indicated by the presence of their respective activities (Figs. 1B and 2A). When bacterial lysate harboring His-PLDα1 was incubated with the lysate containing GST-Gα, PLDα1 was pulled down together with GST-Gα by glutathione beads (Fig. 2A). The presence of PLDα1 in the precipitates was measured by immunoblotting with PLDα1-specific antibodies and assaying PLDα1 activity (Fig. 2A). PLDα1 was not pulled down with GST, indicating that the co-precipitation resulted from the presence of Gα but not GST or the beads. To estimate the stoichiometry of the interaction, Gα and PLDα1 were purified and co-incubated at different molar ratios (Fig. 2B). Increasing the ratio of PLDα1 to Gα from 0.5 to 1 led to a doubling of the PLD co-precipitated with Gα, whereas an increase in the molar ratio to 2:1 did not lead to a further increase in PLDα complexed with Gα. These results indicate that PLDα1 binds to Gα in a 1:1 ratio.Fig. 2Binding of Gα with PLDα1 expressed in E. coli. A, co-precipitation of PLDα1 with GST-Gα.

Native PLDα1 was co-precipitated with Gα as measured by immunoblotting and PLDα1-specific activity assays (Fig. 3). As a control, GST beads gave negligible binding to PLDα1 from plant extracts. The amount of PLDα1 co-precipitated with Gα increased as the amount of Gα was increased (Fig. 3), indicating that the Gα and PLDα1 binding is dose-dependent. PLDα1 Contains a DRY-like Motif That Is Responsible for Its Binding to Gα—To determine the molecular basis for the PLDα1 and Gα interaction, the PLDα1 sequence was analyzed for the presence of sequences with similarity to known G-protein-interacting motifs. At amino acid residues 562–586, the sequence of PLDα1 is highly similar to the DRY motif that has been found in more than 200 GPCRs (Fig. 4, A and B). This motif in GPCRs is located at the cytosolic juncture of the third transmembrane domain and is thought to associate with Gα of heterotrimeric G-proteins (24.Scheer A. Costa T. Fanelli F. De Benedetti P.G. Mhaouty-Kodja S. Abuin L. Nenniger-Tosato M. Cotecchia S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 219-231PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Alewijnse A.E. Timmerman H. Jacobs E.H. Smit M.J. Roovers E. Cotecchia S. Leurs R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar). The DRY motif consists of a core triplet of amino acids, D-R-Y, and also a highly conserved hydrophobic region, VYVVV, located immediately downstream. The hydrophobic region is completely conserved in PLDα1 (Fig. 4B) and is conservatively modified in eight other Arabidopsis PLDs. The corresponding triplet amino acids in PLDα1 are conservatively substituted to EKF, which lies between the two duplicated, catalytic HKD motifs (Fig. 4A). Conservative substitutions of the DRY amino acid residues are allowable. For example, receptors in chicken and bullfrog both exhibit E-R-F (Fig. 4B). The EKF residues were mutated individually to Ala to determine the involvement of each of the residues in Gα binding. All of the three mutated PLDα1s displayed the PLD activity comparable with that of wild-type PLD (Fig. 4C), indicating that changing any of the residues to Ala results in no major alteration of PLD catalytic activity. GST-Gα was then co-incubated with the same amounts of wild-type and mutated PLDα1s (Fig. 4D), followed by precipitation of Gα with glutathione beads. Virtually no PLDα1K564A was co-precipitated as measured by the lack of PLDα1 protein (Fig. 4E) and activity (Fig. 4F) in the Gα precipitates. The amount of mutated PLDE563A and PLDF565A co-purified with Gα was more than 3-fold lower than that of wild-type PLDα1 (Fig. 4, E and F). These results indicate that the residue Lys564 is essential for PLDα1 to interact with Gα, whereas the flanking Glu563 and Phe565 are important for enhancing this interaction. Association of Gα with PLDα1 Decreases PLDα1 Activity—To test the effect of the Gα binding on PLDα1 activity, purified Gα was co-incubated with wild-type and mutated PLDα1s at approximately a 1:1 molar ratio, followed by assaying PLDα1 activity (Fig. 5). Addition of Gα decreased the wild-type PLDα1 activity by more than 3-fold, whereas addition of the same amount of an unrelated protein, BSA, had no effect, indicating that the Gα inhibition is not a nonspecific protein effect (Fig. 5A). The Gα inhibition of PLDα1E563A or PLDα1K565A was not as strong as that of wild-type PLDα1, and the lower degree of inhibition is consistent with the decreased Gα binding exhibited by these mutated PLDs. Gα had the least inhibitory effect on PLDα1K564A (Fig. 5A), which exhibited very little binding to Gα (Fig. 4, E and F). The extent of Gα inhibition of PLDα1 is conversely correlated with the binding ability of the various PLDα1s to Gα, indicating that the binding is required for the Gα inhibition of PLDα1 activity. The Gα inhibition of PLD activity was also observed with proteins from Arabidopsis (Fig. 5B). When purified GST-Gα was co-incubated with Arabidopsis leaf protein extracts, Gα decreased ∼60% of PLDα1 activity, whereas co-incubation with the same molar amount of GST or BSA had no effect on PLD activity. This result indicates that the inhibition is caused by Gα, not by GST or agarose beads present in the solution. The extent of inhibition for the leaf PLD was smaller than that of the bacterially expressed PLDα1, which could be caused by having other PLDs in plant extracts, as all Arabidopsis PLDs are active under the PC-PIP2 assay conditions (1.Wang X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2.Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition, because the molar amount of PLDα1 in plant extracts was difficult to determine, the presence of excessive PLDα1 could also contribute to less inhibition of PLD by Gα. Guanine Nucleotides Affect the Gα-PLDα1 Binding and PLDα1 Activity—Gα can bind GDP and GTP; it is GDP-bound in the resting state, whereas an exchange of GDP for GTP is associated with the activation of Gα. To determine whether guanine nucleotides affect the Gα-PLDα1 interaction, purified PLDα1 and Gα were co-incubated at a 1:1 molar ratio in the presence of different concentrations of the hydrolysis-resistant analogues GDPβS and GTPγS. GDPβS gave a dose-dependent inhibition, whereas GTPγS yielded a dose-dependent stimulation of PLDα1 activity (Fig. 6A). When GDPβS or GTPγS was added to the DRY motif mutants and Gα complexes, the activity of PLDα1K564A was not affected significantly (Fig. 6, B and C; GST versus K564A). Compared with that of wild-type PLDα1 and PLDα1K564A, GDPβS and GTPγS had an intermediate inhibitory and stimulatory effect, respectively, on the activity of PLDα1E563A and PLDα1F565A (Fig. 6, B and C; wild-type (WT) versus E563A and F565A). Binding results showed that PLDα1K564A was unable to bind to Gα and that PLDα1E563A and PLDα1F565A had decreased binding (Fig. 4E). Thus, these nucleotide effects on PLD activity are in agreement with the Gα binding abilities of these PLDs, indicating that guanine nucleotides modulate PLD activity through their effects on the Gα and PLDα1 binding. The effect of guanine nucleotides on the Gα-PLDα1 binding was further determined using Arabidopsis leaf extracts (Fig. 7). Consistent with the results shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Gα was able to bind to PLDα1 without any added guanine nucleotide. Adding GDPβS to plant protein extracts increased the amounts of PLDα1 co-purified with Gα as measured by immunoblotting and assaying PLDα1 activity in the co-precipitates (Fig. 7). Conversely, GTPγS decreased the Gα-PLDα1 binding in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition of Gα-PLDα1 binding by Gpp(NH)p, another guanosine triphosphate nucleotide analogue, was even greater than that by GTPγS; almost no PLDα1 was co-precipitated with Gα at 20 μm Gpp(NH)p. This difference could be attributed to the possibility that the Gpp(NH)p is more stable than GTPγS (Fig. 7). These results indicate that the binding of GTP to Gα, thus the activation of Gα, decreases the interaction between Gα and PLDα1, whereas Gα in the resting, presumably GDP-bound state binds to PLD. PLDα1 Binding Stimulates GTPase Activity—To determine potential reciprocal effects of the Gα-PLDα1 interaction, the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα was determined in the presence of wild-type PLDα1 or the non-Gα-binding mutant PLDα1K564A. Wild-type PLDα1 increased the GTPase activity by about 35%, whereas PLDα1K564A had no stimulatory effect on the GTPase activity (Fig. 8A). This result indicates that binding of PLDα to Gα is required for the PLDα1 stimulation of Gα-mediated hydrolysis of GTP. The kinetics of the GTPase activity was assessed by varying the substrate GTP concentrations in the presence or absence of PLDα1 (Fig. 8B). The Michaelis constant Km and the maximal rate Vmax were derived by the Lineweaver-Burk plot. With or without PLDα1, the Km for GTP was 182 nm. The Vmax was 27.0 and 36.4 pmol/mg of protein/min in the presence or absence of PLDα1, respectively. These data suggest that the PLDα1 promotes the turnover number of the GTPase activity without affecting the affinity of Gα for GTP. Results of this study provide evidence for the direct physical interaction between PLDα1 and Gα. Moreover, this study has identified the specific DRY motif on PLDα1 responsible for the binding (Fig. 3). The DRY motif is present in PLDα-related PLDs from different plant species (26.McGee J.D. Roe J. Sweat T.A. Wang X. Guikema J.A. Leach J.E. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 1013-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), indicating that this Gα regulation is conserved for the common plant PLD. The DRY motif is normally found on GPCRs and is important in coupling the receptor and G-protein activation, as mutation of this motif results in a variety of modified phenotypes, including constitutive, moderate, and null receptor activities (24.Scheer A. Costa T. Fanelli F. De Benedetti P.G. Mhaouty-Kodja S. Abuin L. Nenniger-Tosato M. Cotecchia S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 219-231PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Alewijnse A.E. Timmerman H. Jacobs E.H. Smit M.J. Roovers E. Cotecchia S. Leurs R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether the DRY motif on plant PLDs competes with plant GPCRs from the receptor-Gα interaction. However, almost nothing is known about the coupling of Gα to GPCR in plants (10.Assmann S.M. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S355-S373Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11.Jones A.M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The only reported putative Arabidopsis GPCR is GCR1 (27.Colucci G. Apone F. Alyeshmerni N. Chalmers D. Chrispeels M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but its direct interaction with Gα has yet to be demonstrated. In addition, our sequence analysis indicates that Arabidopsis GCR1 does not contain the DRY motif. It has also been stated that the loss-of-function mutant of GCR1 (gcr1) showed no shared phenotypes with that of Gα (gpa1) and that Gα might not be coupled to GCR1 in the cell (11.Jones A.M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, the study on the role of the PLD-Gα interaction in the receptor-Gα interaction awaits identification of a receptor interacting with Gα in plants. It is unlikely that PLDα1 itself serves as a canonical Gα-coupled receptor protein because of its lack of transmembrane domains. Rather, PLDα1 may function as an intracellular regulator of G-proteins. A number of regulator proteins have been identified in other organisms, which include GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (8.Offermanns S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 101-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9.Cismowski M.J. Takesono A. Bernard M.L. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 2301-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, proteins with such functions have not been reported in plants (10.Assmann S.M. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S355-S373Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11.Jones A.M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The present results indicate that PLDα1 has some GAP activity and that the GAP activity requires the Gα-PLDα1 binding (Fig. 8A). The GTPase-activating effect of PLDα1 is relatively small, and this could be due to the absence of an activated GPCR that is required for the function of some GAPs (28.Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis suggests that PLDα1 stimulates GTPase activity via increasing the turnover number without affecting the GTP affinity to the enzyme (Fig. 8B). One way of increasing turnover is to promote the exchange between GDP and GTP. In addition, other modes of regulation of Gα by PLDα1 should also be considered. PLDα1 has been proposed to translocate between cytosol to membranes in plants (1.Wang X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 4.Wang C. Zien C. Afitlhile M. Welti R. Hildebrand D.F. Wang X. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and it might be possible that the PLDα1-Gα binding modulates the intracellular location and thus the activity of G-protein. The effect of the PLDα1-Gα interaction is reciprocal; while it stimulates the GTPase activity of Gα, the interaction inhibits PLDα1 activity (Fig. 5). Results from the mutagenesis of the DRY motif have indicated that the direct binding is required for the effect on both Gα and PLDα1. Whereas the DRY motif on PLDα1 is essential to the binding, the state of Gα activation also determines the PLDα1-Gα interaction. PLDα1 is able to bind to Gα in the resting or GDP-bound state but is unable to bind GTP-bound Gα. A previous study with bacterially expressed tobacco Gα and PLDα also indicates that GTPγS can decrease the Gα inhibition of PLDα activity (18.Lein W. Saalbach G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The dissociation of Gα from PLDα1 is likely to result from a conformational change of Gα triggered by the exchange of GDP for GTP and the activation of Gα. One intriguing question raised from the PLDα1-Gα interaction is whether the PLDα1-Gα interaction modulates the association of Gα with Gβγ. According to the mammalian heterotrimeric G-protein paradigm, Gα in the GDP-bound resting state associates with Gβγ, whereas Gα in the GTP-bound activated state dissociates from Gβγ (8.Offermanns S. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 101-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Some activators of G-protein signaling proteins identified in other organisms have been shown to bind to the resting or GDP-bound form of Gα to release Gβγ (28.Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 29.Blumer J.B. Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Nezu J. Chung P. Dunican D.J. Knoblich J.A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23217-23220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that PLDα1-Gα interaction occurs with or without added GDP, and thus, PLDα1 binds to the resting state, GDP-bound Gα. One canonical Gβ gene and two Gγ genes have been identified in Arabidopsis (30.Weiss C.A. Garnaat C.W. Mukai K. Hu Y. Ma H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9554-9558Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31.Mason M.G. Botella J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1520: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The association has been demonstrated for Gβ and Gγ subunits (31.Mason M.G. Botella J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1520: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but not for Gα and Gβγ. Further studies will be needed to identify the condition under which Gα interacts with Gβγ and then to determine whether the PLDα1 binding regulates the association and/or dissociation between Gα with Gβγ. Possibilities remain also that the association of Gα with Gβγ may affect the Gα-PLDα1 interaction. Another question relevant to the understanding of the PLD-Gα interaction is the specificity of the Gα interaction with various PLDs. Except for two PLDζs and PLDγ2, nine of the 12 PLDs in Arabidopsis have the DRY motif-like sequences (data not shown) and thus can potentially interact with Gα. Different patterns of temporal and spatial expression and distribution have been noted for some PLDs (32.Fan L. Zheng S. Cui D. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1371-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 33.Wang C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34.Katagiri T. Takahashi S. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2001; 26: 595-605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could be important determinants for the Gα interaction with different PLDs in different cells and timing. In addition, individual PLDs exhibit different requirements for Ca2+, PIP2, free fatty acids, and lipid environments for activity (1.Wang X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 33.Wang C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1102-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 35.Qin W. Pappan K. Wang X.

Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2285-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus, the other cellular factors might also modulate the PLD-Gα interaction and specificity. It should be noted that analyses of PLDα1-depleted (7.Sang Y. Zheng S. Li W. Huang B. Wang X. Plant J. 2001; 28: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and Gα-null (12.Wang X.Q. Ullah H. Jones A.M. Assmann S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 2070-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) Arabidopsis have shown some shared phenotypic alterations, such as retardation of stomatal movement and increasing plant water loss. It is likely that the PLDα1-Gα interaction documented in this study underlies a structural and molecular basis for their involvement in specific plant signaling pathways. Based on “Results” and “Discussion,” a working model is proposed for the role and further investigation of the PLDα1-Gα interaction (Fig. 9). PLDα1 binds to the resting state or GDP-bound Gα through the DRY motif. The PLDα1-Gα binding hinders PLDα1 activity and may also promote dissociation of Gβγ from Gα. In addition, the PLDα1-Gα binding stimulates GTPase activity, possibly via promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. At the same time, the binding of GTP to Gα promotes dissociation of the PLDα1-Gα complexes and thus restores PLDα1 activity. The released PLDα1 will be able to bind to GDP-bound Gα again, and another cycle begins. Thus, the association and dissociation between PLD and Gα would form a positive loop to stimulate the activity of PLDα1 and Gα, and this dynamic process would regulate reciprocally the cellular function of both PLD and G-proteins. Further studies on elucidating this novel signaling process and identifying upstream regulators and downstream effectors of the interaction will facilitate the understanding of the cellular roles of PLDs and heterotrimeric G-protein in plant signal transduction.

Pol δ, and Pol ϵ. Several lines of evidence indicate that Pol α and Pol δ function in the initiation and elongation of Okazaki fragment synthesis, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 1.Hindges R.

Ott R. Dianov G.L. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3894-3901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit and the second subunit, encoded in S. cerevisiae by the POL3 and POL31 (HYS2) genes, respectively, are highly conserved in eukaryotes. The genes are also essential in the two yeasts. In contrast, the third subunit shows an extreme divergence at the primary amino acid level. For example, in very closely related yeasts such as S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus, which show a mean amino acid sequence identity of >90% for all proteins, only 82% sequence identity is observed for the Pol32 subunit. In comparison that for Pol3 and Pol31 subunits is 96 and 93%, respectively (16.Cliften P.F. Hillier L.W. Fulton L. Graves T. Miner T. Gish W.R. Waterston R.H. Johnston M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A comparison between more distant eukaryotes, including S. pombe and human, identified only one motif that was highly conserved in this subunit, i.e. the consensus proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-binding motif QXX(L/I)XXFF at the extreme carboxyl-terminus of the protein. Hydrodynamic studies of S. cerevisiae Pol δ have shown the three-subunit complex to be highly elongated, revealing an unusually high Stokes radius and an unusually small sedimentation constant (17.Johansson E. Majka J. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43824-43828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This deviation from globularity of the entire three-subunit complex could be attributed to the extremely elongated structure of Pol32. A recent study (18.Bermudez V.P. MacNeill S.A. Tappin I. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36853-36862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) of S. pombe Pol δ confirmed and extended the S. cerevisiae study and showed that the elongated structure of Cdc27 was mainly caused by the central portion of this subunit; a deletion derivative lacking the central 110 amino acids was much more globular. This structure-function analysis of S. pombe Cdc27 also identified the N-terminal 160 aa domain as being required for interaction with the second subunit, and the C-terminal 20 aa domain for interaction with PCNA. The S. pombe Cdc27 gene for the third subunit is essential for growth (19.MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Even point mutations in Cdc27 that eliminate in vitro binding to PCNA resulted in cell lethality in one study, although, in a second study, overexpression to high levels of C-terminal truncations lacking this domain rescued growth of the Cdc27 deletion (18.Bermudez V.P.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, S. cerevisiae POL32 is not essential, but pol32Δ strains show severe defects in DNA replication, repair, and mutagenesis (10.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, the combination of pol32Δ with conditional mutations in POL3, POL31, or POL30 (PCNA) also resulted in cell lethality. In this study we have addressed the functional role of the Pol32 subunit in DNA metabolism by carrying out a scanning deletion mutagenesis of the protein. The domain structure resulting from this study gives new insights in cell growth and DNA-damage induced mutagenesis in yeast, and of processive DNA synthesis in vitro. Surprisingly, we found that the essential functionalities are comprised in a small amino-terminal domain of Pol32, not much larger than that necessary to specify interaction with Pol31 subunit of Pol δ. Strains—The yeast strains used were BJ2168 (MATa, ura3–52, trp1–289, leu2–3,112, prb1–1122, prc1–407, pep4–3) for overproduction, L40 (Mata ade2 his3-Δ200 leu2–3,112 trp1–901 LYS2::(lexAop)4HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8lacZ) for two-hybrid analysis, PY175 (Mata ura3–52 trp1-Δ his3-Δ200 leu2–3,112 lys2–801 pol32Δ::HIS3) and PY188 (Mata ura3–52 trp1-Δ his3-Δ200 leu2–3,112 lys2–801 pol32Δ::HIS3). PY188 was obtained by back-crossing PY175 with strain PY74 (10.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), which showed a high frequency of damage-induced mutagenesis, and screening the resulting spores for appropriate markers and an elevated frequency of mutagenesis. Plasmids—The Escherichia coli overexpression plasmid pBL370–0 placed a His7 tag, together with a linker of 8 amino acids, at the N terminus of the POL32 gene, under control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter, in the expression vector pPY55. This plasmid was also used to create and express the POL32 scanning deletion mutants by standard PCR mutagenesis. The plasmid carrying the full-length POL32 gene is designated as pBL370–0 and a given derivative plasmid carrying truncation or internal deletion pol32-x as pBL370-x. The same truncations and deletions were also created, by standard subcloning, in the series of yeast complementation plasmid pBL387 (Bluescript ARS CEN TRP1 POL32), and in the yeast two-hybrid plasmid pBL390 (pGBT8 2 μm ori TRP1 lexA-POL32), described previously (10.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the pBL387 and pBL390 series of plasmids did not contain the His7 tag nor the linker sequence. The series of yeast integration plasmids pBL388 (Bluescript LEU2 POL32) had selected POL32 alleles swapped from the pBL387 member into integration vector pRS305. Vector pRS305 or the set of pBL388 plasmids were linearized by cutting with NarI inside the plasmid LEU2 gene, prior to integrative transformation of PY175 into the leu2–3,112 allele to leucine prototrophy. All plasmids and their sequences are available from the corresponding author upon request. Two-hybrid plasmids pBL240 (GAL4activation domain-POL30 in pACT2), pBL364 (GAL4activivation domain-POL31 in pACT2), and pACT2-FR034 (GAL4activation domain-POL1(aa 313–533)) have been previously described (10.Gerik K.J.

Yeast overexpression plasmids pBL336 (2 μm ori TRP1 GAL1promoter-POL3), pBL338 (2 μm ori LEU2 GAL1promoter-POL31), and pBL340 (2 μm ori URA3 GAL10promoter-POL32) have also been described previously (23.Burgers P.M.

PBL340–10 (URA3 GAL10promoter-pol32–10) was made by subcloning the appropriate pol32–10 fragment from pBL370–10 into pBL340. Enzymes—Pol δ, replication factor C, PCNA, and replication protein A were all purified as described previously (23.Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Mutant pcna-79 (I126A/L128A) and pcna-90 (P252A/K253A) were purified as described (24.Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pol δ-10 containing the mutant Pol32–10 subunit was overexpressed in strain BJ2168 and was purified analogous to Pol δ. To remove traces of chromosomally expressed wild-type Pol32-containing Pol δ from the purified preparation, 0.5 mg (1 ml) of the final fraction was adjusted to the same conductivity as that of buffer A100 (30 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P40, 100 mm NaCl) and passed over a 1 ml PCNA-agarose column in A100. The column was washed with 1 ml of A100 and the combined eluates stored at –70 °C. Wild-type Pol δ, but not Pol δ-10 remained bound to this affinity column. This final preparation was free from wild-type Pol32 as shown by a FarWestern analysis (24.Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of His-tagged Pol32 Proteins— BL21(DE3) containing pBL370-x was grown in one liter Terrific Broth at 30 °C to A600 = 0.6–0.8. The temperature was shifted to 15 °C and isopropyl-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 2 mm when the cells reached an A600 = 1.2–1.6. 12–16 h later, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10% sucrose, and frozen on dry ice. After thawing, EDTA was added to 1 mm, p-methylphenyl-sulfonyl fluoride was added to 0.5 mm, and lysozyme was added to 0.2 mg/ml. After 15 min on ice p-methylphenyl-sulfonyl fluoride was added to 0.5 mm. All further steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. After another 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to 0.02%, and the cells were sonicated to complete lysis and reduce the viscosity of the lysate. Ammonium sulfate was added to 150 mm, followed by 40 μl per ml of lysate of 10% polymin P to precipitate the nucleic acids. After stirring for 5 min, the lysate was cleared at 18,000 rpm for 30 min in an SS-34 rotor. To the supernatant was added 0.114 g of solid ammonium sulfate per ml. After stirring for 1 h, the precipitate was spun at 37,000 rpm in a Ti-45 rotor for 40 min. An additional 0.123 g/ml of solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant and stirred for 1 h. The pellet obtained after spinning the precipitate for 40 min at 37,000 rpm was dissolved in 4 ml of buffer E100 (40 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mm NaCl; subscript designates mm NaCl) and frozen on dry ice. After thawing and dialysis against buffer E200, the extract was loaded onto a 3-ml phospocellulose column that was equilibrated in buffer E200. The column was washed with 4 column volumes of buffer E200, followed by a step elution with buffer E1000. The eluate (8 ml) was gently mixed by rotary inversion for 1 h with 0.7 ml of nickel-nitrilo-triacetic acid agarose equilibrated in binding buffer Ni5 (40 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole; subscript designates mm imidazole) for 1 h. The agarose was transferred to a column and washed with 4 column volumes of buffer Ni40, followed by a step elution with bufferNi500. The peak fraction was frozen on dry ice. 400 μl was injected onto a 20 ml Superose 12 column. The Superose 12 column was equilibrated in buffer E200 and calibrated with bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin. The column was run at 0.4 ml/min at 25 °C, and 200 μl fractions were collected and analyzed by 9% SDS-PAGE. The peak fractions from the gel filtration column had a purity of >90% and were devoid of DNA polymerase or nuclease activity. They were used in the reconstitution experiments, for the gel-mobility shift assays, and DNA replication assays. Gel-mobility Shift Assay—Ph-PCNA (PCNA containing an amino-terminal phosphorylatable tag) was 32P-labeled as previously described (24.Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A typical 10 μl reaction mix contained about 18 fmol labeled PCNA, 250 fmol Pol δ*, and ∼100 fmol Pol32 in binding buffer (40 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μg bovine serum albumin, and 100 mm NaCl). The reaction mix without PCNA was preincubated on ice for 2 h. After addition of labeled PCNA, incubation was continued for 3 min at 30 °C. The mixture was chilled on ice before separation on a native low-ionic strength 4% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred onto a Whatmann filter, dried, and subjected to phosphoimaging analysis. In Vitro DNA Replication Assay—The standard 30 μl reaction contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 mm magnesium-acetate, 0.2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 80 μm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, and 10 μm of [32P]dTTP, 0.5 mm ATP, 50 fmol (100 ng) of singly primed single-stranded mp18 DNA (the 36-mer primer is complementary to nt 6330–6295), 1 μg (9 pmol) of replication protein A, 1 pmol wild-type or mutant PCNA, 100 fmol of replication factor C, and NaCl, Pol δ,orPol δ*, and wild-type or mutant Pol32 as indicated in the legend to the figures. Incubations were at 30 °C for the times indicated. The reactions were stopped with 10 μl of 60% glycerol/50 mm EDTA/1% SDS, and electrophoresed on a 1 or 1.5% alkaline agarose gel. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Pol δ* (360 ng, 2 pmol) was incubated in buffer H200 (40 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.01% Nonidet P40, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 mm NaCl; subscript designates mm NaCl) in a final volume of 20 μl together with 100 ng (2.5 pmol) of Pol32 or Pol32–8 for 1 h at 0 °C. Controls consisted of Pol δ and of Pol δ*. Rabbit antiserum (1.5 μl) raised against the Pol31 subunit was added to each of the reactions and incubation continued for another hour on ice. Magnetic beads (15 μl) containing sheep anti-rabbit IgG, equilibrated in E200, were added to the reactions and the reactions were left on ice with occasional mixing for 1 h. The beads were washed with 4 × 30 μlofH400, followed by 30 μl of H70. Pol α (2 pmol, 600 ng) was added to the beads in a final volume of 20 μl of H70. After 15 min, the beads were washed with 3 × 30 μl of H70, followed by elution with 2 × 15 μl of H500. The supernatants from the H500 elution were combined and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, followed by a Western analysis with monoclonal antibodies against the catalytic subunit of Pol α. The Pol32 subunit is an excellent target for a domain analysis by genetic and biochemical means for several reasons. First, the S. cerevisiae gene is not essential but shows at least three distinct phenotypes, i.e. cold-sensitivity for growth, sensitivity to the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea, and a defect in damage-induced mutagenesis. Secondly, interactions of Pol32 with at least four proteins have putatively been identified. These include Pol31, the second subunit of Pol δ, Pol1, the catalytic subunit of Pol α, PCNA, and Srs2 (10.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22.Huang M.E. Le Douarin B. Henry C. Galibert F. Mol. Gen.

Some of these protein-protein interactions have only been identified by a two-hybrid analysis and have awaited analysis by more direct methods. For none of these interactions has its relevance for cellular DNA metabolism and chromosome maintenance been established. Finally, the functionality of Pol32 and its (deletion) mutations can be easily assessed biochemically in replication studies. The catalytic and the second subunit form an isolatable heterodimeric complex, Pol3-Pol31, which we have designated as Pol δ* (23.Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Fully active Pol δ can be easily reconstituted by incubation of purified Pol δ* with Pol32, and the particular phenotype, e.g. complex stability, processivity, PCNA interaction, etc., of a particular Pol32 mutant determined biochemically. Domain Analysis of Pol32—To ascertain which domain of Pol32 is required for each of the proposed protein-protein interactions and which domains contribute to one or more of the observed phenotypes of the pol32 deletion, we carried out a scanning deletion mutagenesis study of POL32 (Fig. 1). A series of truncations and internal deletions of the POL32 gene was fused to the DNA-binding domain of the bacterial LexA gene. The deletion constructs were then assayed in the two-hybrid system in strains containing either the POL1, POL30, or POL31 gene fused to the GAL4 activation domain (26.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Interaction of POL32 with POL31 requires the N-terminal 92 aa, as alleles –1, –2, and –27 were defective, but –3 and –26 showed full interaction strength by the two-hybrid method. The extreme carboxyl-terminus of the 350-amino acid Pol32 protein contains the PCNA-consensus motif 338-QGTLESFFKRKAK-350 (conserved amino acids in bold). Not surprisingly, both allele –10, which deletes the last seven amino acids including the two conserved phenylalanines, and allele –9, which has an internal deletion from Lys-311 through Ser-343 are defective for interaction with PCNA (POL30) by two-hybrid analysis. Finally, the interaction with the catalytic subunit of Pol α-primase, POL1, resides within a discrete domain just upstream of the domain that interacts with PCNA. Alleles –7 and –9 showed partial defects, whereas allele –8 was completely defective. It is important to note that observed interaction defects in the deletion alleles are not caused by failure of a particular allele to express or be imported into the yeast nucleus. For each allele, at least one interaction could still be observed; e.g. pol32–1, defective for interaction with POL31, still showed comparable to wild-type interactions with POL1 and POL30. The only exception was pol32–27, for which mutant a several-fold lower signal with POL30 was observed, suggesting that decreased expression and/or stability could contribute to the observed phenotype. From this analysis we conclude that Pol31, Pol1, and PCNA interact with discrete and separate domains on the Pol32 protein. Previous interaction studies by the yeast two-hybrid method have also identified putative interactions of Pol32 with itself and with Srs2. The two-hybrid interaction of Pol32 with itself, suggesting the existence of a Pol32-Pol32 dimer, has been shown to be indirect and mediated by PCNA, i.e. Pol32·PCNA·Pol32 (17.Johansson E. Majka J. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43824-43828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An interaction between Pol32 and Srs2 was also suggested from a weak two-hybrid signal between POL32 and a small carboxyl-terminal region of SRS2 (25.Huang M.E. de Calignon A. Nicolas A. Galibert F. Curr. Genet. 2000; 38: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The observed two-hybrid signal was too small to permit a systematic analysis similar to that carried out with the other three genes. Furthermore, no two-hybrid signal was observed when we attempted to measure interactions of POL32 with full-length SRS2 in either combination, i.e. LexAbinding domain-POL32 with GAL4interaction domain-SRS2, or LexAbinding domain-SRS2 with GAL4interaction domain-POL32. Phenotypic Defects in POL32 Deletion Alleles—Strains deleted for POL32 show close to normal growth at 30 °C although late S phase cells do accumulate (10.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22.Huang M.E. Le Douarin B. Henry C. Galibert F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 260: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, growth at low temperatures is severely inhibited and so is growth at 30 °C in the presence of hydroxyurea. In addition, deletion mutants are defective for damage-induced mutagenesis, indicating an essential role for Pol δ in error-prone DNA synthesis past sites of damage (10.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 25.Huang M.E. de Calignon A. Nicolas A. Galibert F. Curr. Genet. 2000; 38: 178-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Similar conclusions have been reached from the study of mutations in the catalytic subunit of Pol δ (27.Giot L. Chanet R. Simon M. Facca C. Faye G. Genetics. 1997; 146: 1239-1251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Torresramos C.A. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25445-25448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Eliminating the interaction between Pol32 and PCNA in alleles –9 and –10 did not deleteriously affect growth at 12 °C or on hydroxyurea-containing media (Fig. 1). Similarly, no defects were detected when the interaction with POL1 was eliminated in alleles –8 or –11. In fact, defects were only detected when deletions approached the N-terminal region of POL32 required for interaction with POL31. Whereas allele pol32–11, which deleted the central half of POL32 showed wild-type growth, slight growth defects were observed in pol32–26 even though the interaction with POL31 was apparently still intact. A further deletion of 10 amino-terminal amino acids in pol32–27 completely eliminated the interaction with POL31. One possible problem with the interpretation of these results is that the fusion of the POL32 alleles with the LexA DNA-binding domain used for the interaction analysis in the two-hybrid analysis might effect any of the factors related to protein folding, protein stability, nuclear import, etc., differently from the analogous alleles with only native POL32 sequences. Therefore, pol32-Δ strains were transformed with the pBL390-x series of plasmids containing the LexA-POL32 fusion constructs and the growth studies were repeated. The identical results were obtained, i.e. strains containing LexA-pol32–11 showed no defects, those containing LexA-pol32–26 showed partial growth defects, and those containing LexA-pol32–27 were as defective as the deletion strains (data not shown). The PCNA-binding Motif in POL32 Enhances the Efficiency of Mutagenesis—UV-induced mutagenesis of the series of mutants was investigated at a single dose of 30 J/m2. The analysis was carried out in two distinct pol32-Δ strains. PY188 containing POL32 shows a higher frequency of UV-induced mutations in the CAN1 gene than strain PY175 with POL32 (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1). The reason for this difference is unknown. Mutants pol32–9 and pol32–10 that inactivate the PCNA-binding motif showed a slight but significant reduction in survival after UV irradiation. This was accompanied by a similar minor significant reduction in the frequency of mutagenesis, particularly for allele pol32–9 (Fig. 1). No defects in mutagenesis were detected in the alleles pol32–8 and pol32–11 defective for interaction with POL1. On the other hand, all alleles defective for interaction with POL31, e.g. pol32–1, pol32–2, and pol32–27, were also completely defective for mutagenesis, suggesting that the Pol32 subunit mediates its role in mutagenesis through the Pol δ complex. Interestingly, mutant pol32–26 that interacted efficiently with POL31 was still defective for mutagenesis (Fig. 1). The fusion gene LexA-pol32–26, which showed the strong intera"
https://openalex.org/W1992222070,"Channel-kinase TRPM7/ChaK1 is a member of a recently discovered family of protein kinases called α-kinases that display no sequence homology to conventional protein kinases. It is an unusual bifunctional protein that contains an α-kinase domain fused to an ion channel. The TRPM7/ChaK1 channel has been characterized using electrophysiological techniques, and recent evidence suggests that it may play a key role in the regulation of magnesium homeostasis. However, little is known about its protein kinase activity. To characterize the kinase activity of TRPM7/ChaK1, we expressed the kinase catalytic domain in bacteria. ChaK1-cat is able to undergo autophosphorylation and to phosphorylate myelin basic protein and histone H3 on serine and threonine residues. The kinase is specific for ATP and cannot use GTP as a substrate. ChaK1-cat is insensitive to staurosporine (up to 0.1 mm) but can be inhibited by rottlerin. Because the kinase domain is physically linked to an ion channel, we investigated the effect of ions on ChaK1-cat activity. The kinase requires Mg2+ (optimum at 4-10 mm) or Mn2+ (optimum at 3-5 mm), with activity in the presence of Mn2+ being 2 orders of magnitude higher than in the presence of Mg2+. Zn2+ and Co2+ inhibited ChaK1-cat kinase activity. Ca2+ at concentrations up to 1 mm did not affect kinase activity. Considering intracellular ion concentrations, our results suggest that, among divalent metal ions, only Mg2+ can directly modulate TRPM7/ChaK1 kinase activity in vivo.

Considering intracellular ion concentrations, our results suggest that, among divalent metal ions, only Mg2+ can directly modulate TRPM7/ChaK1 kinase activity in vivo. A new family of protein kinases that do not display sequence homology to conventional eukaryotic protein kinases has been recently identified (1Ryazanov A.G. Ward M.D. Mendola C.E. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Wiedmann M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Parmer T.G. Prostko C.R. Germino F.J. Hait W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4884-4889Google Scholar, 2Ryazanov A.G. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R43-R45Google Scholar). When mammalian and Caenorhabditis elegans elongation factor-2 kinases (eEF-2 1The abbreviations used are: eEF-2elongation factor-2ChaKchannel kinasecatcatalytic domainTRPMtransient receptor potential channel, melastatin familyMBPmyelin basic proteinPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinase.1The abbreviations used are: eEF-2elongation factor-2ChaKchannel kinasecatcatalytic domainTRPMtransient receptor potential channel, melastatin familyMBPmyelin basic proteinPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinase. kinases) were cloned, it was found that they do not display sequence homology to any conventional eukaryotic protein kinase (1Ryazanov A.G. Ward M.D. Mendola C.E. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Wiedmann M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Parmer T.G. Prostko C.R. Germino F.J. Hait W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4884-4889Google Scholar). However, their catalytic domains appeared to be homologous to the catalytic domain of myosin heavy chain kinase A from Dictyostelium (3Futey L.M. Medley Q.G. Cote G.P. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 523-529Google Scholar, 4Cote G.P. Luo X. Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6846-6849Google Scholar, 5Pavur K.S. Petrov A.N. Ryazanov A.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12216-12224Google Scholar). Two more protein kinases with the same type of catalytic domain have been subsequently identified in Dictyostelium and have been called myosin heavy chain kinases B and C (6Clancy C.E. Mendoza M.G. Naismith T.V. Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11812-11815Google Scholar, 7Liang W. Licate L. Warrick H. Spudich J. Egelhoff T. BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 19Google Scholar). This new family of protein kinases was named α-kinase, because the existing evidence suggests that these protein kinases phosphorylate amino acids located within α-helices (2Ryazanov A.G. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R43-R45Google Scholar). This is different from conventional protein kinases that phosphorylate amino acids located within loops, turns, or regions with irregular structure (8Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Google Scholar). The α-kinase catalytic domain is characterized by several conserved motifs, which are different from the distinguishing sequence motifs that are found in conventional protein kinases (2Ryazanov A.G. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R43-R45Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the recently determined three-dimensional structure of the α-kinase catalytic domain revealed that, despite the lack of sequence homology, α-kinases have a fold that is very similar to conventional eukaryotic protein kinases (9Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Google Scholar).Five more human proteins with the α-kinase domain have been identified and cloned (2Ryazanov A.G. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R43-R45Google Scholar, 10Ryazanova L.V. Pavur K.S. Petrov A.N. Dorovkov M.V. Ryazanov A.G. Mol. Biol. 2001; 35: 271-283Google Scholar, 11Ryazanov A.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 26-29Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, it was found that two of these proteins, which we initially named melanoma and kidney α-kinases and subsequently renamed channel-kinases 1 and 2 (ChaK1 and ChaK2), contained domains that are homologous to members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels (10Ryazanova L.V. Pavur K.S. Petrov A.N. Dorovkov M.V. Ryazanov A.G. Mol. Biol. 2001; 35: 271-283Google Scholar, 11Ryazanov A.G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 26-29Google Scholar). Three other laboratories independently cloned ChaK1 and named it ChaK (9Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Google Scholar), TRP-PLIK (12Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Google Scholar), or LTRPC7 (13Nadler M.J.S. Hermosura M.C. Inabe M.J.S.K. Perraud A.-L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.-P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Google Scholar). The TRP family of ion channels consists of various cation channels with diverse cellular functions that can be subdivided into three subfamilies: TRP-classic (TRPC), TRP-vanilloid (TRPV), and TRP-melastatin (TRPM) (reviewed in Refs. 14Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Google Scholar, 15Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Google Scholar, 16Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V.

Cell. 2002; 9: 229-231Google Scholar). According to recently suggested unified nomenclature for TRP channels (16Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J. Bruford E.A. Caterina M.J. Clapham D.E. Harteneck C. Heller S. Julius D. Kojima I. Mori Y. Penner R. Prawitt D. Scharenberg A.M. Schultz G. Shimizu N. Zhu M.X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 229-231Google Scholar), ChaK1 and ChaK2 are now called TRPM7 and TRPM6 respectively. To emphasize the unique bifunctional nature of TRPM7 and TRPM6, we will be referring to them as TRPM7/ChaK1 and TRPM6/ChaK2 in this paper.The electrophysiological properties of the TRPM7/ChaK1 channel have been recently characterized (12Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Google Scholar, 13Nadler M.J.S. Hermosura M.C. Inabe M.J.S.K. Perraud A.-L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.-P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Google Scholar). It was found that the TRPM7/ChaK1 channel is permeable to Ca2+ and Mg2+, is inhibited by Mg2+ or Mg-ATP (13Nadler M.J.S. Hermosura M.C. Inabe M.J.S.K. Perraud A.-L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.-P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A.

A distinctive current that is believed to be mediated by TRPM7/ChaK1 and that can be inhibited by Mg2+, has been characterized in several types of cells (13Nadler M.J.S. Hermosura M.C. Inabe M.J.S.K.

Physiol. 2002; 120: 221-235Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that TRPM7/ChaK1 may represent a novel ion channel mechanism for cellular trace metal ion entry into vertebrate cells (21Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Hermosura M.C. Nadler M.J.S. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 49-60Google Scholar). Another recent study suggests that TRPM7/ChaK1 may play a key role in the regulation of Mg2+ homeostasis (22Schmitz C. Perraud A.-L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R. Kurosaki T. Fleig A. Scharenberg A.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 191-200Google Scholar).Despite the extensive characterization of TRPM7/ChaK1 channel activity, little is known about TRPM7/ChaK1 kinase activity besides its ability to autophosphorylate and to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (10Ryazanova L.V. Pavur K.S. Petrov A.N. Dorovkov M.V. Ryazanov A.G. Mol. Biol. 2001; 35: 271-283Google Scholar, 12Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Google Scholar, 22Schmitz C. Perraud A.-L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R. Kurosaki T. Fleig A. Scharenberg A.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 191-200Google Scholar). In addition, the functional inter-relationship between the α-kinase domain and the ion channel domain in TRPM7/ChaK1 is still unclear.This work provides the first detailed characterization of the protein kinase activity of channel-kinase TRPM7/ChaK1. We investigated the biochemical properties of the TRPM7/ChaK1 kinase catalytic domain and, in particular, the effect of various divalent metal ions on TRPM7/ChaK1 kinase activity. Our results suggest that, among divalent metal ions that TRPM7/ChaK1 channel can permeate, only Mg2+ can directly modulate TRPM7/ChaK1 kinase activity in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Buffer reagents and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Rottlerin and staurosporine were dissolved in Me2SO. Radioisotopes were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PCR reagents and restriction enzymes were from Invitrogen and Roche Applied Science.

All experiments were carried out with both the short and long forms of ChaK1-cat, and essentially no difference was observed in any of the experiments. Experimental data presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 were obtained with the short form of ChaK1-cat.Fig. 2Kinase activity of ChaK1-cat.A, purified recombinant ChaK1-cat was incubated with MBP or H3 and [γ-33P]ATP in a kinase reaction mixture as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

The PCR fragment was inserted into a pCR II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) by TA cloning and then subcloned into a pMAL-p2x vector (New England Biolabs) using EcoRI restriction sites to obtain the resulting construct, pMAL-mkhC 3.15.The expression and purification of ChaK1-cat (short form) was performed as follows. Escherichia coli DH5α cells harboring the pMAL-mkhC 3.15 construct were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 2g/liter glucose (with ampicillin, 100 μg/ml) to A600 of 0.5 and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were then grown for an additional 6 h at 37 °C. All of the following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% (w/v) glycerol) containing complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), and dissolved in an 80-ml solution of 8 m urea in buffer A. The sample was sonicated and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against buffer A. After dialysis, the sample was centrifuged again at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto an amylose (New England Biolabs) column (10 ml) equilibrated with buffer A containing complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Elution was performed by a step gradient using buffer A plus 10 mm maltose.To produce ChaK1-cat (long form), a DNA fragment corresponding to the whole C-terminal part of TRPM7/ChaK1 starting right after the sixth trans-membrane domain was obtained by PCR using TRPM7/ChaK1 cDNA in pCR II-TOPO as a template and the following primers: chak1-C5-blunt, 5′-AATGTGTATTTACAAGTGAAGGCAATTTC-3′, and chak1-C3-XbaI, 5′-GCTCTAGATTATAACATCAGACGAACAGAATTAGTTG-3′. KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen) was used, which produced PCR product with blunt ends. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and then inserted into pMAL-c2x vector (New England Biolabs) using XmnI and XbaI restriction sites to produce the pMmkC2 construct. The expression and purification of the long form of ChaK1-cat was performed similar to ChaK1-cat (short form), except the expression was carried out at room temperature, which produced soluble protein. Therefore, the denaturation/renaturation step involving the dissolution in urea and dialysis was omitted. Bacteria were lysed by incubation with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 1 h on ice and subsequently sonicated.Protein Phosphorylation Assay—Assays for ChaK1-cat activity were carried out in an assay buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol), and 0.5 μg of recombinant ChaK1-cat. The total volume of the reaction was 50 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In the case where MBP or histone H3 was phosphorylated by ChaK1-cat, the assays were performed as described above with the addition of 1 μg of MBP or 1 μg of histone H3.Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Autophosphorylation of ChaK1-cat and phosphorylation of MBP and histone H3 were done as described above, except that 20 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol) per reaction was used, and the reaction volume was increased 5-fold. The samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) by semi-dry transfer. The portion of membrane with phosphoprotein was excised and incubated in 6 m HCl at 110 °C for 1.5 h. After incubation, the samples were dried with a Speedvac evaporator, and the dried material was dissolved in water. Nonradioactive phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine were added to the samples. Phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis on thin-layer cellulose plates 10 × 10 cm (cellulose on polyester, Aldrich). The first dimension was performed in pH 1.9 electrophoresis buffer containing 0.58 m formic acid and 1.36 m acetic acid at 1000 V for 20 min. The second dimension was performed in pH 3.5 electrophoresis buffer containing 0.87 m acetic acid, 0.5% (v/v) pyridine, and 0.5 mm EDTA at 1000 V for 8 min. The TLC plates were stained with 0.2% ninhydrin in ethanol and then exposed to film.RESULTSTo investigate the protein kinase activity of TRPM7/ChaK1, we expressed its C-terminal part containing kinase catalytic domain as a fusion with maltose binding protein. SDS-PAGE analysis of affinity-purified fusion protein (ChaK1-cat) showed a major band migrating at about the 95-kDa position (Fig. 1A). To determine whether ChaK1-cat is a multimer in solution, gel filtration was performed. ChaK1-cat eluted as a single kinase activity peak corresponding to a protein with the molecular mass of ∼300 kDa (Fig. 1B). This molecular mass is higher than the expected molecular mass of ChaK1-cat dimer (190 kDa); however, it is consistent with a dimer if the molecule is elongated. In fact, according to x-ray analysis, ChaK1 crystallizes as a dimer that has an unusually elongated structure (9Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Google Scholar). Therefore, active ChaK1-cat is likely to be a dimer in solution.Affinity-purified ChaK1-cat was able to undergo autophosphorylation and also phosphorylated MBP and histone H3 (Fig. 2A). ChaK1-cat appears to be specific for ATP and cannot utilize GTP as a phosphate donor. Neither autophosphorylation nor phosphorylation of MBP was observed when ATP was substituted in the reaction with GTP (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2C represents the time course of phosphorylation of MBP by ChaK1-cat. Incorporation of 33P into MBP was linear during the first 15 min. To analyze the effect of autophosphorylation on kinase activity, ChaK1-cat was preincubated with unlabeled ATP for 20 min at 30 °C before the addition of MBP and [γ-33P]ATP. As can be seen from Fig. 2D, preincubation of ChaK1-cat with ATP resulted in inhibition of subsequent autophosphorylation but did not affect the kinetics of MBP phosphorylation, suggesting that autophosphorylation does not affect ChaK1-cat kinase activity.Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that autophosphorylation of ChaK1-cat and phosphorylation of MBP occur predominantly on serine (Fig. 3, A and B). Phosphorylation of threonine in both cases was barely detectable (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast to autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of MBP, phosphorylation of histone H3 occurred at threonine (60%) and serine (40%) (Fig. 3C). As can be seen in Fig. 3D, eEF-2 kinase, another α-kinase that is known to phosphorylate its substrate on threonine, indeed phosphorylated eEF-2 exclusively on threonine.Considering the unique nature of TRPM7/ChaK1 as being protein kinase covalently linked to an ion channel, there is a possibility that TRPM7/ChaK1 kinase activity can be regulated by the ions that permeate the channel. Because TRPM7/ChaK1 channel is permeable not only to Ca2+ but also to other divalent metal ions, such as Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ (21Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Hermosura M.C. Nadler M.J.S. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 49-60Google Scholar) and is Mg2+-regulated (13Nadler M.J.S. Hermosura M.C. Inabe M.J.S.K. Perraud A.-L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.-P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of Mg2+ and other divalent metal ions on ChaK1-cat kinase activity. As can be seen in Fig. 4, A and B, ChaK1-cat requires the presence of Mg2+ for its activity, and the optimal concentration of Mg2+ for both phosphorylation of MBP by ChaK1-cat and its autophosphorylation is ∼4-10 mm.We found that Mn2+ dramatically activates ChaK1-cat. Analysis of the effect of Mn2+ at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 mm revealed that the stimulatory effect of Mn2+ is noticeable at 0.5 mm and is maximal at ∼3.5 mm (Fig. 4, C and D). Both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of MBP are strongly activated by Mn2+ (Fig. 4C). Phosphorylation of MBP by ChaK1-cat at 3.5 mm Mn2+ is stimulated ∼70-fold (Fig. 4D). Autophosphorylation in the presence of Mn2+ also caused a noticeable shift in the electrophoretic mobility of ChaK1-cat. In the presence of Mn2+, Mg2+ is not required for the phosphorylation reaction, and at 3.5 mm Mn2+ and 10 mm Mg2+ kinase activity was slightly lower than in the presence of 3.5 mm Mn2+ alone (Fig. 4A). Thus, ChaK1-cat requires either Mg2+ or Mn2+; however, the kinase activity is ∼2 orders of magnitude higher in the presence of Mn2+ than in the presence of Mg2+. As can be seen in Fig. 4E, phosphorylation of histone H3 by ChaK1-cat was also strongly increased when MnCl2 was added to the reaction mixture.It is known that some protein kinases can change their specificity for phosphorylated amino acid when a reaction is performed in the presence of Mn2+ instead of Mg2+. For example, phosphorylase kinase acts as a serine-specific kinase in the presence of Mg2+ but acts as a tyrosine kinase in the presence of Mn2+ (23Yuan C.J. Huang C.Y. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17683-17686Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis of autophosphorylated ChaK1-cat as well as MBP and histone H3 phosphorylated by ChaK1-cat in the presence of Mn2+. The addition of Mn2+ does not affect specificity of ChaK1-cat for phosphorylated amino acid. When autophosphorylation of ChaK1-cat and phosphorylation of MBP were performed in the presence of Mn2+, phosphorylation of both serine and threonine increased with >90% of 32P incorporated into serine (data not shown). Similarly, in the presence of Mn2+, phosphorylation of both threonine and serine in histone H3 was significantly increased. The activity and specificity of eEF-2 kinase were not affected by the addition of Mn2+ (data not shown).Other divalent cations that we tested cannot substitute for Mn2+ in activating ChaK1-cat. In fact, Zn2+ and Co2+ strongly inhibit phosphorylation of MBP by ChaK1-cat (Fig. 5). Both Zn2+ and Co2+ at concentrations of 500 μm completely inhibited MBP phosphorylation by ChaK1-cat (Fig. 5).The addition of Ca2+ (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mm) or EGTA (2 mm) did not have any effect on the kinase activity of ChaK1-cat (Fig. 6A). However, in the presence of calmodulin, the addition of 0.1 or 1 mm Ca2+ led to significant inhibition of MBP phosphorylation by ChaK1-cat (Fig. 6A). Similarly, 1 mm Ca2+ in the presence of calmodulin inhibited the phosphorylation of histone H3 (Fig. 6B). However, the addition of Ca2+ and calmodulin did not have any effect on the autophosphorylation of ChaK1-cat (Fig. 6, A and B).To further analyze the inhibitory effect of Ca2+/calmodulin on the phosp"

Here, we report the cloning and expression of a novel human paralog, MARK4, which shares 75% overall homology with MARK1-3 and is predominantly expressed in brain. Homology is most pronounced in the catalytic domain (90%), and MARK4 readily phosphorylates tau and the related microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and MAP4. In contrast to the three paralogs that all exhibit uniform cytoplasmic localization, MARK4 colocalizes with the centrosome and with microtubules in cultured cells. Overexpression of MARK4 causes thinning out of the microtubule network, concomitant with a reorganization of microtubules into bundles. In line with these findings, we show that a tandem affinity-purified MARK4 protein complex contains α-, β-, and γ-tubulin. In differentiated neuroblastoma cells, MARK4 is localized prominently at the tips of neurite-like processes. We suggest that although the four MARK/PAR-1 kinases might play multiple cellular roles in concert with different targets, MARK4 is likely to be directly involved in microtubule organization in neuronal cells and may contribute to the pathological phosphorylation of tau in Alzheimer's disease.

During these processes, microtubules serve as tracks for regulated movement and positioning of organelles and other membrane microdomains. Such processes require a dynamic microtubule array and are regulated by motor proteins and structural MAPs (4Scales S.J. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E.

The binding of tau and MAP2 to microtubules is controlled by phosphorylation in a spatial and temporal fashion (12Mandell J.W. Banker G.A. Perspect. Dev. Neurobiol. 1996; 4: 125-135PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of the activity that was most effective in phosphorylating the microtubule-binding domain of the MAPs tau, MAP2, and MAP4 led to the identification of three kinases that were termed MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinases (MARKs) (13Drewes G. Trinczek B. Illenberger S. Biernat J. Schmitt-Ulms G. Meyer H.E. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol.

MARKs phosphorylate tau and related MAPs on their tubulin binding repeats and consequently catalyze their detachment from microtubules in vitro and in cultured cells (13Drewes G. Trinczek B.

Cytoskeleton. 1999; 44: 209-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the major serine in tau specifically phosphorylated by MARK, serine 262, is hyperphosphorylated in tau from the neurofibrillary deposits found in Alzheimer's disease brains (18Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is in agreement with the observation that tau purified from such neurofibrillary deposits has lost the ability to bind to microtubules, which can be restored by dephosphorylation (19Alonso A.C.

Interestingly, in these organisms, the MARK-like kinases are involved in processes related to the establishment of cell polarity. The MARK ortholog in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, kin1p, is necessary for proper growth initiation from the cell tips (25Drewes G. Nurse P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, defective PAR-1 prevents the early asymmetric cell divisions of the germ line lineage (21Guo S. Kemphues K.J.

Recently, it was reported that Drosophila PAR-1 also functions as a molecular switch by phosphorylating Dishevelled, thus enabling it to transduce the Wnt signal to β-catenin (28Sun T.Q. Lu B.

Overexpression of MARK2 abrogates epithelial polarity in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (31Bohm H. Brinkmann V. Drab M. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Curr.

Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6126) Google Scholar) shows that the human MARK/PAR-1 gene family consists of four paralogous genes, of which one has not yet been characterized. In this study, we describe the cloning and characterization of the MARK4 protein kinase and demonstrate that MARK4 is distinct from the other members of the MARK kinase family, in that it associates with microtubules, centrosomes, and neurite-like processes of neuroblastoma cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Cloning—Cosmid R31237 from chromosome 19 contained part of the open reading frame of a novel MARK family member, which we termed MARK4, and was used for the design of primer 5′-GGCTCAGAGCTCGAGGTCGT TGGAGATG-3′ to amplify the complete open reading frame from human fetal brain Marathon cDNA (BD Biosciences, Clontech) by RACE-PCR using rTthXL polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the adaptor-specific primer AP1 (BD Clontech). For reasons of sequence fidelity, the 3′ portion of the amplified open reading frame was then replaced by the ScaI-XhoI fragment from an EST from human neuroepithelium, IMAGE:531830 (RZPD, Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fuer Genomforschung, Berlin, Germany). The open reading frame was fully sequenced on both strands, and the sequence was deposited into GenBank™ (accession number AY057448). For expression, the MARK4 open reading frame was fused N-terminally with a HA tag (15Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) or with GFP (BD Biosciences, Clontech) and subcloned into pZome1 (Cellzome AG, Heidelberg, Germany) or pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) via BamHI and KpnI restriction sites. Between the tag sequences and the ATG of the open reading frame, we inserted an oligonucleotide cassette encoding a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site as described previously (35Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). To test whether the expression vector itself or the site where GFP is fused to MARK4 has any effect on the expression and intracellular location of the fluorescent signal, MARK4 was also subcloned via Gateway™ cloning into pcDNA-DEST47 and pcDNA-DEST53 providing a C- or N-terminal GFP tag, respectively (Invitrogen). Human MARK3 was amplified by RT-PCR from human fetal brain mRNA (BD Clontech) using rTthXL polymerase and primers 5′-CAGGCGCCTCCTCCGCAGCC-3′ and 5′-ACCTGAGAAAAAGTGAATTTTTA-3′, cloned into pCDNA3, and sequenced on both strands, and the sequence was deposited into GenBank™ (accession number AF465413). Human MARK2 and γ-tubulin were subcloned by PCR from cDNA clones IMAGE:3850417 and IMAGE:3345973, respectively (RZPD) and subcloned into pCDNA3 and pZome1, respectively. HA-tagged rat MARK1 was expressed from a pCDNA3 plasmid as described previously (15Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). A catalytically inactive mutant of MARK4 was generated by mutating residues threonine 214 and serine 218 both into Ala using the mutagenic primer pair 5′-TCGAAGCTGGACGCCTTCTGCGGGGCCCCCCCTTATGCCGCCCCG-3′ and 5′-CGGGGCGGCATAAGGGGGGGCCCCGCAGAAGGCGTCCAGCTTCGA-3′ and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Cell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), both supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). For Neuro2a cells (ATCC), minimum Earle medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine was used. Differentiation of Neuro2a cells was induced for 24-48 h adding only 0.1% fetal calf serum to minimum Earle medium. For fluorescence investigation of fixed or living cells, cell lines were grown onto coverslips or seeded onto LabTek chambered cover glass (NUNC, Naperville, IL) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. Plasmids (150 ng) were transfected either into CHO or Neuro2a cells at 70% confluency by lipofection using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 cells were transfected by calcium-phosphate precipitation using 8 μg of DNA mixed with 62.5 μl of 2 m CaCl2, 2× Hanks'-buffered solution (280 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, 12 mm glucose, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7) in a final volume of 0.5 ml, which was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and used for a 10-cm plate of cells at ∼30% confluency.Fluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were fixed either with methanol for 10 min at -20 °C (Fig. 6, A-C) or 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 37 °C (Fig. 3). After fixation, cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibody incubation was performed in phosphate-buffered saline, 3% goat serum for 1 h at 37 °C. Monoclonal mouse anti-γ-tubulin antibody (Sigma) and polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody (BD Biosciences Clontech) were used. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, both from Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). For paraformaldehyde fixation, cells were washed in microtubule-stabilizing buffer (80 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 4% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6,000, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) for 5 min at 37 °C, fixed for 20 min at 37 °C in 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. Antibody treatment was performed using polyclonal rabbit anti-HA antibody and monoclonal mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody followed by incubation with TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted in Permafluor (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and analyzed the following day. For life observation (Figs. 4 and 5), cells were directly examined 16-18 h after transfection. Images were captured with an Axiovert fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a ×63 oil immersion objective, a CCD-camera using filters optimized for double-labeled experiments, and with Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, San José, CA) implemented for image processing.Fig. 3MARK kinases exhibit distinct cytoplasmic localization patterns, but only MARK4 colocalizes with microtubules. HA tag plasmid alone (A) or HA tag containing different tagged MARK constructs as indicated were transiently expressed in CHO cells, and cells were stained with antibodies against the HA epitope (left panels) and against tubulin (right panels). B and C, MARK4 exhibits colocalization with microtubules and induces thinning of the microtubule array and rearrangement into bundles. D and E, MARK4-T214A/S218A, a catalytically inactive MARK4 point mutant, does not colocalize with microtubules or induce bundling. F-H, MARK1, MARK2, or MARK3 does not exhibit colocalization with microtubules.

A-C, representative cells expressing GFP-MARK4 at 6, 12, and 48 h after transfection. D-F, representative cells expressing GFP-MARK4-T214A/S218A at 6, 12, and 48 h after transfection. 6 h after transfection, both active and inactive MARK4 label the centrosome (A and D). 12 h after transfection, active but not inactive MARK4 labels microtubules originating from the MTOC (B and E). 48 h after transfection, most cells round up and die (C and F). The micrographs in G-L show examples of MARK4-labeled microtubules in detail. Two (three in J) centrosomes nearby the nucleus (N) and filamentous structures emanating from the centrosomes, which likely represent bundles of microtubules. The centrosomes become clearly visible even with epifluorescent microscopy because MARK4 decreases the number of microtubules within the cells by inducing bundling. In K, only six microtubules are attached to one centrosome, whereas the other shows no microtubules at all in the focal plane (arrow).

As a result of the decreased number of microtubules, the centrosomes become clearly visible (see arrows in E and F). The fluorescent labeling of the MTOC and microtubule filaments originating from it is similar to the signal observed in CHO cells (Fig. 4). Amplified centrosomes are also labeled by GFP-MARK4 (A and B). Scale bar, 4 μm. G-J, Neuro2a cells differentiated by serum starvation and visualized 16 h post-transfection, showing GFP labeling of microtubules in the cell body. For many cells, only faint labeling is observed along the elongated processes (middle), possibly because of the lack of microtubules (H and I). Notably, the signal always increases again at the tip of these processes (left, arrows).

Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. A 10-μl sample of the supernatant was removed for immunoblotting. The remainder was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc (BD Biosciences Clontech) or anti-HA resin (Roche Diagnostics) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with lysis buffer without Triton X-100. Beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and detected using either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 3F10 at 1/20,000 for horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 9E10 at 1/10,000 (BD Biosciences Clontech). Tandem affinity purification of MARK4 was performed from HEK293 cells stably transduced with pZome1-MARK4, and copurifying proteins were sequenced by LC-MS/MS essentially as described previously (36Gavin A.C.

For kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer as above and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Beads were incubated with 10 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of protein substrate) for 30 min at 30 °C. To stop the reaction, 5 μl of boiling 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was then added. In vitro phosphorylation studies were performed with bacterially expressed substrate proteins: human tau isoforms, MAP2c, and the tau-MTBD and MAP4-MTBD fragments (comprising the repeats of the microtubule-binding domain) as described previously (14Illenberger S. Drewes G. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Meyer H.E. Olmsted J.B. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotides 5′-CCTGCCCGCCGGTCCCGGAC-3′ and 5′-GCAACTTGTGACCTCAGGTC-3′ (MWG Biotech, Munich, Germany) were mixed and labeled to 107 cpm/pmol using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Dreieich, Germany) and hybridized using QuickHyb solution according to the manufacturer (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Western blotting was performed as described previously (17Ebneth A. Drewes G. Mandelkow E. Cell Motil.

Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 79: 101-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), representing a fourth paralog, which we termed MARK4. Using 5′-RACE, we cloned the complete open reading frame from fetal brain mRNA. The encoded protein contains the characteristic sequence domains of the MARK/PAR-1 kinase family (Fig. 1A). The overall sequence homology within the MARK family is 55% with a higher degree of homology among MARK1, MARK2, and MARK3 (70%). The kinase domain at the N terminus of the protein exhibits the highest degree of homology, slightly over 90%. Notably, the LDT(Pi)FCGS(Pi)P motif containing the two activating phosphorylation sites in the regulatory loop is conserved (15Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain is followed by the small ubiquitin-associated domain (38Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), which is thought to mediate interaction with ubiquitin (39Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Adjacent to the ubiquitin-associated domain is a large less conserved “spacer” region and a conserved C-terminal kinase-associated (KA) domain (38Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), which is an exclusive feature of this protein family (Fig. 1A). In MARK4, the large spacer region is the least conserved, the overall homology with MARK1, MARK2, and MARK3 being <30%, thus setting MARK4 apart from MARK1-3 in a phylogenetic diagram (Fig. 1B). The human MARK4 locus is 19q13.3, which is close to a known susceptibility locus for Alzheimer's disease ascribed to the ApoE gene. The 4.4-kb MARK4 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed as analyzed by Northern blot with the highest levels in brain and testis. In testis, a larger mRNA, which may represent a splice variant, is also detected (Fig. 1C).Fig. 1MARK4 is a member of a conserved protein kinase family.A, sequence alignment of human MARK4 (GenBank™ accession number AAL23683) with its three paralogs MARK1 (GenBank™ accession number AAF72103), MARK2 (GenBank™ accession number CAA66229), and MARK3 (GenBank™ accession number AAL69982).

https://openalex.org/W2083991508,"The evolutionary success of planktic calcifiers during the Phanerozoic stabilized the climate system by introducing a new mechanism that acts to buffer ocean carbonate-ion concentration: the saturation-dependent preservation of carbonate in sea-floor sediments. Before this, buffering was primarily accomplished by adjustment of shallow-water carbonate deposition to balance oceanic inputs from weathering on land. Neoproterozoic ice ages of near-global extent and multimillion-year duration and the formation of distinctive sedimentary (cap) carbonates can thus be understood in terms of the greater sensitivity of the Precambrian carbon cycle to the loss of shallow-water environments and CO 2 -climate feedback on ice-sheet growth."

In addition to HSP22, also abundant in muscles are other sHSPs including HSP27, myotonic dystrophy kinase-binding protein (MKBP, HSPB2), HSPB3, αB-crystallin (αB-Cry, HSPB5), HSP20 (HSPB6), and cvHSP (HSPB7) (7.Krief S.

It is now widely accepted that sHSPs play a major role in muscles, although their precise role is not understood. A point mutation in the αB-Cry gene causes desmin-related cardiomyopathy in humans (9.Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar), and MKBP binds to and activates the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, an enzyme that when absent results in myotonic dystrophy (10.Suzuki A.

Overexpression of HSP22 in heart was recently shown to be associated with hypertrophy (6.Depre C. Hase M. Gaussin V. Zajac A. Wang L. Hittinger L. Ghaleh B. Yu X. Kudej R.K. Wagner T. Sadoshima J.

Phosphorylation of HSP27 has been implicated in the contraction (13.Yamboliev I.A. Hedges J.C. Mutnick J.L. Adam L.P. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1899-H1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of HSP20 in the relaxation (14.Beall A. Bagwell D. Woodrum D. Stoming T.A. Kato K. Suzuki A. Rasmussen H. Brophy C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11344-11351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) of smooth muscle cells. sHSPs have been shown to form two types of hetero-oligomeric complexes in striated muscles: type I complex consisting of HSP27, αB-Cry, and HSP20, and type II complex consisting of MKBP and HSPB3 (8.Sugiyama Y. Suzuki A. Kishikawa M. Akutsu R. Hirose T. Waye M.M. Tsui S.K.W. Yoshida S. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). sHSP complexes are heterogeneous in size and composition. The molecular mass of cellular sHSP complexes varies over a wide range (∼50–1000 kDa) and changes under stress conditions leading usually to smaller complexes (15.Kato K. Hasegawa K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11274-11278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crucial role of these complexes for cell survival under stress conditions has been demonstrated (16.Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Briolay J. Fostan P. Mirault M.E. Arrigo A.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 1312: 367-375Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Based on these findings it is believed that the formation of homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes of sHSPs is essential for their function. Most available data concerning formation and structure of sHSP complexes are based on studies of αA-crystallin, αB-Cry, and HSP27. These three sHSPs form dynamic homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes which may have a micellar structure and rapidly exchange subunits (17.Augusteyn R.C. Ghiggino K.P. Putilina T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1162: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18.Sun T.X. Liang J.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). HSP27 dimerizes, and two such dimers form tetramers, which are in equilibrium with larger complexes (20.Ehrnsperger M. Lilie H. Gaestel M. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14867-14874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Human HSP27 is phosphorylated at three sites (Ser15, Ser78, Ser82) by the protein kinase MAP-KAPK-2 resulting in the disassembly of large oligomeric structures predominantly into tetramers (15.Kato K. Hasegawa K. Goto S. Inaguma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11274-11278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Interactions within HSP27 complexes involve at least two sites, one site within the C-terminal α-crystallin domain and the other site at the far N terminus (22.Lambert H. Charette S.J. Bernier A.F. Guimond A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9378-9385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The site in the α-crystallin domain has been proposed to be involved in dimer formation (23.Liu C. Welsh M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and these dimers are thought to further multimerize into larger complexes using the N-terminal dimerization site. If HSP22 belongs to this group of proteins, we hypothesized that it interacts with itself and with other sHSPs which may result in the formation of homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes, similarly to other sHSPs. In an initial effort to characterize HSP22, we have studied its phylogenetic relationship among Bilateria proteins and confirmed that it is a member of the superfamily of sHSPs. By gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) we show that HSP22 forms high molecular mass complexes in the heart, similarly to other sHSPs. By yeast TH experiments, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), cross-linking (CL), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy we show that HSP22 interacts with itself and with the other tested sHSPs. We show also that HSP22 has two binding domains that are specific for individual sHSPs. Phylogeny of sHSPs—A profile hidden Markov model in HMMR 2.2 g was employed to characterize, search for and align diverse sHSP superfamily members. The non-redundant protein data base (GenBank™ CDS translations+PDB+SwissProt+PIR) was queried with sHSP-HMM for significant matches (proteins with bit scores of 4 or greater and expectation values of 0.05 or less were retained). The resulting sequences were aligned with the sHSP-HMM. To estimate phylogeny and to approximate the posterior probabilities of the tree, a Bayesian inference approach with Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo, or MC3, was used. More details are given elsewhere (24.Fontaine J.M. Rest J.S. Welsh M.J. Benndorf R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).

The PCR cycle conditions for cvHSP cDNA amplification from a human heart cDNA library (Clontech) were 50 s 95 °C, 50 s 63 °C, and 60 s 72 °C. For all TH experiments, the vectors pAS2–1 (abbreviated: pAS) and pACT2 (abbreviated: pACT) (Clontech) were used. For eukaryotic expression of Myc- and FLAG-tagged sHSPs the vectors pcDNA3.1-myc (Invitrogen) and pFlag-CMV2 (Sigma) were used, and for eukaryotic expression of YFP- and CFP-sHSP fusion proteins the vectors pEYFP and pECFP (Clontech) were used.

Open table in a new tab Two Hybrid Experiments—Small scale sequential transformation of the yeast strain Y190 was performed as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Interactions between full-length (F), N-terminal (N), and C-terminal halves (C) of sHSPs were analyzed. Briefly, yeast was first transformed with the constructs 2, 5, or 6 and grown on -Leu medium, or with construct 1 and grown on -Trp medium. In the second step, the yeast was transformed with vectors as specified in the Figs., and plated on -Trp, -Leu, -His selective medium. Y190 has two reporter genes (his+, growth of colonies; gal+, blue colonies), and two proteins were considered as interacting partners only if both reporter genes were activated. In order to reduce false positive results, every used vector with an insert was tested with an empty partner vector. In some of these controls the his+ reporter gene was moderately activated resulting in between 10 and 100 colonies/10-cm Petri dish; however, the gal+ reporter gene was never activated (not shown). Cell Culture, Transfection, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Cross-linking—293T and COS-7 cells (ATCC) were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To prevent detachment of 293T cells, tissue culture plates were treated with poly-l-lysine before seeding the cells. For transient transfection FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h later, cells were harvested and processed for co-IP, CL, or FRET analysis. For co-IP, 2 μg of a rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Sigma) or mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) were bound to 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (20% slurry, Sigma) by incubating for 2 h at 4 °C in 500 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 1% Triton X-100; 5 mm EDTA; 1 mm EGTA; 1×protease inhibitor mix, Roche Applied Science). Transfected and non-transfected COS-7 cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer A on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was then precleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C before it was incubated with the antibody-coated beads overnight at 4 °C on a rotating platform. Then the beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed three times with buffer A. Bound immunocomplexes were released from the beads by a 3-min boiling in 100 μl of buffer B (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 2% SDS; 10% glycerol; 200 mm dithiothreitol; 0.01% bromphenol blue; 1×protease inhibitor mix). Thereafter, samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Negative controls were run with rabbit and mouse preimmune sera instead of anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies (not shown). For CL, transfected 293T cells grown in 6-well plates were washed with cold PBS. Glutaraldehyde (Sigma) was diluted with PBS (0.0001, 0.0002, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.002% final concentrations) immediately before use, and 1 ml of these solutions was added per well. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then cells were cooled on ice and washed with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed with 1 ml of buffer B. The lysates were sonicated for 10 s in order to break down DNA, and then boiled for 5 min. These samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Size Exclusion HPLC—0.5 g of the left ventricle of a Rhesus monkey heart was homogenized in 2 ml ice-cold buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl; 5 mm KCl; 1 mm EDTA; 10% glycerol; 1% CHAPS; 1× protease inhibitor mix) using a PowerGen 125 homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and 100 μl of the supernatant was used for HPLC chromatography. Before loading the sample, the column (Protein PAK 300 sw, 0.75 × 30 cm, Waters) was equilibrated with buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl; 5 mm KCl; 1 mm EDTA), and separation of the proteins was at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected as indicated in Fig. 2. Proteins in all fractions were precipitated overnight by 2 vol of ethanol/1% β-mercaptoethanol at –20 °C, and the precipitates were collected by centrifugation. The air-dried pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of buffer B, briefly sonicated and boiled for 5 min. These samples were then analyzed for the presence of HSP22, HSP27, and MKBP by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using specific antibodies. The column resolved proteins with molecular masses ranging from <10 to >670 kDa and was calibrated using the molecular mass markers Dextran blue (>1000 kDa), thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa) (Fig. 2). Electrophoretic Methods and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE and transfer of the separated proteins onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Western blotting) were performed as described (1.Benndorf R. Sun X. Gilmont R.R. Biederman K.J. Molloy M.P. Goodmurphy C.W. Cheng H. Andrews P.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26753-26761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (1:5,000) (Sigma), mouse anti-Myc antibody (1:5000) (Roche Applied Science), and sheep anti-HSP22 (1.Benndorf R. Sun X. Gilmont R.R. Biederman K.J. Molloy M.P. Goodmurphy C.W. Cheng H. Andrews P.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26753-26761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) were used as primary antibodies. As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fc fragment-specific), goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc fragment-specific) and rabbit anti-sheep IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson) were used at a dilution of 1:10,000. The membranes were processed for detection using the ECL plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Measurements—COS-7 cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected with various YFP-sHSP and CFP-sHSP constructs as listed in Table I coding for the corresponding fusion proteins. Two days later, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted on slides with Prolong antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes) and used for microscopy. For FRET microscopy, an Axiovert 135TV microscope equipped with a ×40 FLUAR 1.3NA oil immersion objective lens and a CFP/YFP filter set was used (Zeiss). Images were recorded at room temperature using a cooled integrated CCD camera DAGE RT 3000 (DAGE-MTI Inc.). NIH Image software was used to acquire 8-bit gray scale images from a Scion LG3 video capture board and to quantify the image pixel intensities within user selected regions of each cell. The same region was selected for analysis in each of the images obtained from an individual cell. Individual images were exported in TIFF format and image montages created using Adobe Photoshop. No post-processing of images was conducted after acquisition. FRET was measured by determining the CFP emission before and after an 8-min photobleaching step of YFP as described (25.Siegel R.M. Ka-Ming Chan F. Zacharias D.A. Swofford R. Holmes K.L. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Science's Stke. 2000; 38: 1-6Google Scholar). The increase or dequenching of CFP emission is a direct measure of the FRET due to interaction. Interaction as measured by FRET is expressed as FRET Factor (FF) in Equation 1. FF=Ic-post-BpostIc-ante-BanteCF-1-1(Eq. 1) The symbols are defined as: Ic-post, Ic-ante, intensity of the CFP-signals in the region of interest after and before photobleaching, respectively; Bpost, Bante, background signals, outside of cell areas, after and before photobleaching, respectively; CF, correction factor (the ratio of the intensities of the CFP signals after and before photobleaching of an image area with cells which were not photobleached). The CF is used to eliminate fluctuations of the CFP signal during the course of the experiment. Ideally, if two partners do not interact, the FF-value would be 0, and any value above 0 would indicate interaction. However, individually expressed CFP and YFP control proteins are known to interact to a certain extent (26.Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). The FF value of this negative control (FF–C) was determined to be 0.096 ± 0.023 under the applied experimental conditions. Every FF value measured for interacting CFP/YFP-sHSP fusion proteins must be significantly higher than this value. For positive control, a CFP-YFP fusion protein was expressed (27.Hoppe A. Christensen K. Swanson J.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3652-3664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The measured FF value of 0.384 ± 0.037 is significantly different from FF–C (p < 0.0001) and indicates the range in which FF values for interacting proteins can be expected. For both, the interacting pairs of sHSPs and the controls, the CFP signal intensities before and after photobleaching of 10 randomly selected cells were measured. This allowed determining the significance of the differences of the FF values to the FF–C by the Student's t test. Phylogenetic Relationship of HSP22 among the Bilateria sHSPs—In the light of the divergent roles proposed for HSP22 (see Introduction and “Discussion”), we sought to gain additional information by a phylogenetic analysis. HSP22, like the other human sHSPs, consists of the conserved α-crystallin domain, a less conserved N-terminal domain, a variable central region, and variable N- and C-terminal tails (Fig. 1A). Based on the multiple alignment of all 10 human sHSPs, a hidden Markov model (sHSP-HMM) was built that was used to search the entire non-redundant protein data base (24.Fontaine J.M. Rest J.S. Welsh M.J. Benndorf R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This sHSP-HMM identified 167 Bilateria sHSP-like proteins, including all known mammalian sHSPs as proteins with significant sequence similarity. The sHSP-HMM was used to align these 167 proteins, and the alignment was used to build a Byesian inference phylogeny. An abbreviated version of this phylogeny illustrating the overall topology of Bilateria sHSPs while detailing the relationship of the HSP22 and HSP27 clades, is shown in Fig. 1B. The mammalian HSP22 form a monophyletic group which is supported by the posterior probability of 1.0. The HSP22 clade is sister to the clade of HSP25/27 of Euteleostomi including mammals, birds and fish. Thus, HSP22 is most closely related to HSP27 among all proteins contained in the databases, while protein kinases or proteins related to the Herpex simplex protein kinase ICP10 were not identified. Based on this analysis, HSP22 clearly is classified as a member of the superfamily of sHSPs. Therefore, we analyzed HSP22 for the property, which is characteristic for this superfamily: the ability to interact with itself and other sHSPs, which results in the formation of complexes. Size Distribution of HSP22 Complexes in Monkey Heart—In order to determine the possible involvement of HSP22 in sHSP complex formation in tissues, a protein extract of a piece of Rhesus monkey heart was analyzed by gel filtration HPLC followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The proteins were extracted under moderate stringency conditions in order to leave sHSP complexes intact. HSP22 partitioned into all fractions corresponding to molecular masses between 25 kDa and >670 kDa with most of the proteins being found in the high molecular mass fractions (Fig. 2). For comparison, the size distribution of two further sHSPs, HSP27 and MKBP, was also analyzed. HSP27 showed a molecular mass partition, which is very similar to that of HSP22 and also to previous analyses (28.Arrigo A.P. Suhan J.P. Welch W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5059-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), while MKBP partitioned into fractions with smaller molecular masses approximately between 25 and 200 kDa. These data suggest that (i) different sHSPs may have different size distributions, and (ii) HSP22 may interact with itself and/or other sHSPs, such as HSP27 and MKBP, which partition completely or partially into the same fractions. HSP22-HSP22 Interaction—Earlier biochemical data suggested that HSP22 forms homo-dimers (1.Benndorf R. Sun X. Gilmont R.R. Biederman K.J. Molloy M.P. Goodmurphy C.W. Cheng H. Andrews P.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26753-26761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here we examined the HSP22-HSP22 interaction in greater detail. Yeast TH assays using the constructs 1 and 2 (Table I) were performed to determine the interaction of HSP22 with itself (Fig. 3A). Both reporter genes (his+, gal+) clearly indicated interaction of HSP22 with itself. This interaction was verified biochemically by co-IP using Myc- and FLAG-tagged HSP22 (constructs 7, 8) expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3B). As expected, after transfection with HSP22-myc the anti-FLAG antibody did not precipitate HSP22-myc, while after transfection with Flag-HSP22 the anti-FLAG antibody did precipitate Flag-HSP22 (controls). After co-transfection with both HSP22-myc and Flag-HSP22, the anti-FLAG antibody pulled down both Flag-HSP22"
https://openalex.org/W2062212385,"Reconstituted actin filament networks have been used extensively to understand the mechanics of the actin cortex and decipher the role of actin cross-linking proteins in the maintenance and deformation of cell shape. However, studies of the mechanical role of the F-actin cross-linking protein filamin have led to seemingly contradictory conclusions, in part due to the use of ill-defined mechanical assays. Using quantitative rheological methods that avoid the pitfalls of previous studies, we systematically tested the complex mechanical response of reconstituted actin filament networks containing a wide range of filamin concentrations and compared the mechanical function of filamin with that of the cross-linking/bundling proteins α-actinin and fascin. At steady state and within a well defined linear regime of small non-destructive deformations, F-actin solutions behave as highly dynamic networks (actin polymers are still sufficiently mobile to relax the stress) below the cross-linking-to-bundling threshold filamin concentration, and they behave as covalently cross-linked gels above that threshold. Under large deformations, F-actin networks soften at low filamin concentrations and strain-harden at high filamin concentrations. Filamin cross-links F-actin into networks that are more resilient, stiffer, more solid-like, and less dynamic than α-actinin and fascin. These results resolve the controversy by showing that F-actin/filamin networks can adopt diametrically opposed rheological behaviors depending on the concentration in cross-linking proteins.

These results resolve the controversy by showing that F-actin/filamin networks can adopt diametrically opposed rheological behaviors depending on the concentration in cross-linking proteins. Monomeric filamin is a high molecular mass (250 kDa), 80-nm actin-binding protein that features an actin-binding domain in its N terminus and forms a V-shaped, flexible dimer (1.van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Filamin cross-links actin filaments into orthogonal networks below a threshold filamin concentration and bundles them above that threshold in vitro (2.Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Filamin isoforms are ubiquitously expressed in unicellular and multicellular organisms, eukaryotes, and prokaryotes (1.van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In cultured non-muscle adherent cells such as fibroblasts, filamin localizes to the cortical actin network, the base of cell membrane protrusions, and along stress fibers (3.Matsudaira P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In dividing cells, filamin is concentrated in the cleavage furrow, where it remains associated at the mid-body region until the completion of cell division (4.Nunnally M.H. D'Angelo J.M. Craig S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Expression of the dysfunctional human filamin-A causes the genetic disorder of ventricular heterotopia, presumably due to reduced neuronal migration to the cortex (5.Fox J.W. Lamperti E.D.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1589-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), reduced migratory speed (8.Flanagan L.A. Chou J. Falet H. Neujahr R. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and increased susceptibility to force-induced membrane leakage (9.Glogauer M. Arora P. Chou D. Janmey P.A. Downey G.P. McCulloch C.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), all of which are phenotypes attributed to reduced stiffness of cortical actin. These observations, along with filamin's key role in actin organization, membrane stabilization, and the anchoring of transmembrane cell receptor proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, suggest that filamin has an important mechanical function (2.Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). The mechanical function of filamin in vitro has been tested extensively but is the subject of much debate. Cell migration requires sol-gel transitions that result from coordinated rearrangements of the cortical actin network (10.Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). It is believed that these transformations can be accounted for by the dynamical behavior of F-actin 1The abbreviations used are: F-actin, filamentous actin; G-actin, globular actin.1The abbreviations used are: F-actin, filamentous actin; G-actin, globular actin. cross-linking proteins, an argument supported by in vitro studies using reconstituted actin networks in the presence of cross-linking proteins (11.Sato M. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Nature. 1987; 325: 828-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Indeed, actin filament solutions containing the cross-linking protein α-actinin stiffen under high rate deformations and deform readily under slow deformation (11.Sato M. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Nature. 1987; 325: 828-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), which was also observed in initial rheological studies of filamin (12.Zaner K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7615-7620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a dynamical cross-linking mechanism would be particularly suitable in fast motility events such as membrane ruffling in fast moving cells like keratocytes. However, later studies of filamin's mechanical function in vitro suggest that cortical actin is rheologically equivalent to a covalently cross-linked gel at all tested rates of deformation (13.Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Such solid-like behavior would be particularly suitable for maintaining cell shape for long periods of time. To deform, the cytoskeleton would have to rely solely on mechanisms that modulate the actin network stiffness through the regulation of filament length (e.g. by gelsolin) or cross-linking activity (e.g. phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2) for α-actinin) (13.Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Resolution of this issue is of physiological relevance, as it will help identify some of the filamin-based structural motifs necessary for actin network organization, which is central to cell shape maintenance and cell locomotion. These seemingly contradictory results about filamin's mechanical behavior were initially attributed to the use of rheological methods that broke filaments and reduced artificially the solution's viscosity in earlier studies of filamin and α-actinin (13.Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 14.Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Kas J. Lerche D. Maggs A. Sackmann E. Schliwa M. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32503-32513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our paper shows that the apparently contradictory results are also attributable to both the effect of the filamin-to-actin molar ratio on actin network mechanics and the applications of ill-defined strain and frequency sweep assays (see details under “Results”) in the rheological characterization of actin networks containing filamin. Results presented in this paper show that mechanical assays, which are typically used to test the stiffening potential of cytoskeleton networks, i.e. their ability to strengthen when subject to shear forces, can be misleading. Here, using quantitative rheological methods within well defined linear and nonlinear strain-amplitude regimes, we tested the mechanical behavior of actin filament networks in the presence of filamin, which was compared with networks containing α-actinin and fascin. Our studies resolve the apparent controversy by systematically probing the frequency-dependent and strain-dependent viscoelastic moduli of F-actin/filamin networks while ensuring that no filament breakage occurs during rheological testing and over a wide range of filamin concentrations. Our results show that F-actin/filamin networks behave as highly dynamic networks (actin polymers are still sufficiently mobile to relax the stress) below a filamin threshold concentration and as covalently cross-linked gels above that threshold. Purification of Cytoskeletal Proteins—Unless specified, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. Actin was prepared from chicken breast (16.Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Mg2+-actin filaments were generated by adding 0.1 volume of 10-X KMEI (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 100 mm imidazole, pH 7) polymerizing salt to 0.9 volume of G-actin in buffer G (0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1mm sodium azide, and 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). Filamin and α-actinin were purified from chicken gizzard as described (17.Feramisco J.R. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1194-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human fascin was expressed and purified as described (16.Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The binding of filamin to F-actin was previously characterized in vitro by Hartwig and Stossel (18.Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 563-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These authors showed that the binding of filamin was saturated at a ratio of one filamin molecule per 14 actin monomers. Hence, for the 24 μm actin solutions used in our experiments, the saturation concentration is ∼1.7 μm. The filamin concentrations used in this report varied between 0.06 and 0.24 μm, which correspond to nominal filamin-to-actin molar ratios of 1:400 and 1:100, respectively. Therefore all concentrations used in the present study are much lower than the saturation concentration. Rheology—To probe the mechanical properties of F-actin/fascin networks, we employed a strain-controlled mechanical rheometer (ARES-100; Rheometrics, Piscataway, NJ) equipped with a lower plate and an upper truncated cone (cone angle = 4°) as described (19.Tseng Y. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1643-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The temperature of the solution was maintained at 25 °C to within 0.2 °C. The G-actin solution (24 μm) was mixed with filamin in a test tube, and a one-tenth volume of 10-X KMEI was added to the solution (total volume, 1.5 ml), which was immediately loaded onto the lower plate of the rheometer using a micropipette with a cutoff tip. The plate is coupled to a computer-controlled motor, which can apply steady or oscillatory shear deformations of controlled frequency and amplitude. The cone is connected to a torque transducer, which measures the stress induced by the shear deformation within the F-actin specimen. When an oscillatory deformation of frequency ω is applied, the instrument computes the in-phase and out-of-phase components of the stress divided by the amplitude of the oscillatory deformation, which are the storage (or elastic) modulus, G′(ω), and the loss (or viscous) modulus, G″(ω), respectively. For each specimen, actin gelation was probed by measuring G′ and phase angle δ = tangent –1(G″/G′) every 30s by application of two cycles of shear deformation of 1% amplitude and 1 radian/s frequency. After steady state was reached, the frequency-dependent elasticity G′(ω) and phase angle δ(ω) were measured by setting the amplitude of the oscillatory deformation to γ0 = 1% and sequentially varying the frequency from ω = 0.05 to 100 radian/s. The strain dependence of the modulus of F-actin networks with and without cross-linking proteins was obtained by subjecting the networks to step deformation of increasing strain amplitude and monitoring the time-dependent relaxation of the stress induced in the network. The ratio of the stress to the deformation amplitude is the relaxation modulus (see “Results” for more details), which is independent of the strain amplitude at low deformation amplitude up to a yield strain amplitude. Past that threshold strain, the modulus can either increase (i.e. strain hardening) or decrease (i.e. strain-softening) for increasing deformation amplitude. Each set of experiments (linear rheology, non-linear rheology, different cross-linkers, etc.) was conducted with the same batch of actin solution. For each new rheological assay, we systematically started with measurements of the linear elasticity and viscosity of F-actin alone; these measurements were extremely reproducible. F-actin Network Gelation in the Presence of Filamin Is Monotonic at Low Filamin Concentrations and Biphasic at High Filamin Concentrations—To characterize the mechanical properties of actin filament networks in the presence of filamin, we measured first the rate and extent of gelation of F-actin solutions containing filamin upon the addition of polymerizing salt by using quantitative rheological methods. Gelation is defined here as the process of formation of a stiff network presumably caused by the onset of topological overlaps among polymerizing actin filaments and filament cross-linking/bundling by filamin, and it is monitored by the network's elasticity (i.e. stiffness) at a fixed frequency of 1 radian/s and a deformation amplitude of 1% (20.Doi M. Edwards S.F. The Theory of Polymer Dynamics. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). When elasticity reached a steady state value, elastic and viscous moduli were measured as a function of frequency and deformation amplitude to probe network dynamics and possible network stiffening under shear deformation, respectively. Up to 0.12 μm filamin in 24 μm actin ([filamin]:[actin] = 1:200), the elasticity of the network increased monotonically until it reached a steady state value, typically ∼2–3 h after the addition of the polymerizing salt to the filamin/G-actin mixtures (Fig. 1A). For a filamin-to-actin molar ratio ≥1:133 (0.18 μm filamin), however, the time course of elasticity featured a distinct maximum that occurred at a time (∼2 min) that increased slightly for increasing filamin concentration (Fig. 1B). The phase angle of F-actin networks containing up to 1:200 filamin decreased steadily during the first 2 h of gelation and remained mostly constant during the rest of the experiment (∼5 h) (Fig. 1C). This means that for long periods of time the increase in viscosity paralleled the increase in elasticity of the network undergoing gelation. In contrast, for filamin-to-actin molar ratios higher than 1:133, the phase angle decreased promptly to extremely low values (∼2–3°), rendering the network mostly solid-like in minutes (Fig. 1D) (21.Ferry J.D. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980Google Scholar). For comparison, a liquid such as glycerol displays a (constant) phase angle of 90°, and a Hookean solid displays a phase angle of 0°. The molar ratio at which the transition from monotonic to nonmonotonic gelation kinetics occurs corresponds to the threshold filamin concentration at which a transition from orthogonal networks to tight bundles occurs (2.Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). F-actin Solutions Behave as Highly Dynamic Networks at Low Filamin Concentrations and as Covalently Cross-linked Gels at High Filamin Concentrations—When the elastic modulus reached a steady state value, actin filament networks were subject to small (1%) oscillatory deformations of increased frequency to probe the dynamical behavior of filaments/bundles in solution. In the absence of filamin, the elastic modulus, G′(ω), of actin filament networks displayed a relatively steep frequency dependence at high frequency (Fig. 2A). At high filamin concentration, G′(ω) profiles became independent of frequency (Fig. 2A), suggesting that, up to time scales of 2π/ω∼600 s, actin polymers showed little mobility. This absence of relaxation behavior was maintained up to time scales of ∼600 s as confirmed by stress relaxation measurements (Fig. 4C). Hence, from a rheological standpoint, F-actin solutions behave as relatively dynamic networks at low filamin concentrations and as covalently cross-linked gels at high filamin concentrations.Fig. 4Mechanical response of F-actin/filamin networks to shear deformations.

However, G′ increased >8.4-fold for molar ratios between 1:200 (0.12 μm) and 1:100 (0.24 μm) at 1 radian/s (Fig. 2B) and 14-fold at 0.1 radian/s. Similarly, the phase angle underwent a sharp transition at a filamin-to-actin molar ratio of 1:133 (0.18 μm), from δ ∼30° to δ <3° (Fig. 2, C and D). F-actin Networks Soften under Shear at Low Filamin Concentrations and Strain-harden at High Filamin Concentrations—In vivo experiments suggest that filamin plays a central mechanical role during motility events (2.Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), but how filamin may provide the actin cytoskeleton with mechanical resilience remains unclear. The resilience and strain-dependence of the mechanical properties of F-actin/filamin networks have been measured previously using the strain-sweep assay (13.Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), a method that we now show is fundamentally flawed (see also “Discussion”). In the strain-sweep assay, multiple oscillatory deformations of controlled frequency are applied, and in-phase and out-of-phase components of the oscillatory stress induced within the network are monitored to extract elastic and viscous moduli as a function of deformation amplitude. As illustrated in Fig. 3, this assay is unsuitable because, at large deformation amplitudes, the stress becomes non-periodic and the stress amplitude decreases over time (Fig. 3D, inset) presumably due to filament breakage/alignment during the assay itself (compare Fig. 3, A and B, obtained at deformation amplitudes of γ0 = 1 and 35%, respectively). The effect is also detectable in Lissajoux figures where the induced time-dependent stress is plotted against the applied time-dependent strain (Fig. 3, C and D). Lissajoux figures obtained at large deformation amplitudes show a stress that increases dramatically during the first oscillation but is greatly decreased during subsequent oscillations (Fig. 3D). These problems cause the computation of G′ and G″ (which, at its core, assumes that stress and strain are periodic functions) to become ill-defined, which defeats the purpose of the strain-sweep assay, because its purpose is to probe the network modulus beyond the linear regime (see more under “Discussion”). Here, the mechanical response of F-actin/filamin networks under increasing shear was rigorously quantified by subjecting the networks to step deformations of increasing shear amplitudes (22.Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The step-deformation assay avoids the limitations and approximations of the strain-sweep assay. A rapidly imposed step deformation of total amplitude γ0 causes stress within the network, which relaxes because of polymer motion in solution (20.Doi M. Edwards S.F. The Theory of Polymer Dynamics. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar, 23.Morse D.C. Macromolecules. 1998; 31: 7044-7067Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The deformation-dependent shear modulus profile is defined as a the ratio of the measured time-dependent stress σ and the deformation amplitude, G(t;γ0) = σ(t, γ0)/γ0, superimposed for deformations up to ∼10% (Fig. 4A). This value of strain amplitude is the yield strain γc, which defines the limit of the linear rheological regime for which deformations are small enough (γ0 < γc) that the stress σ induced in the network proportional to the applied deformation amplitude and the network modulus G is independent of γ0 (21.Ferry J.D. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980Google Scholar). For γ0 > γc = 10%, the modulus decreased steadily over all probed time scales (Fig. 4, A and B), due presumably to filament breakage and/or shear-induced orientation (22.Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This means that actin filament networks containing low filamin concentrations “soften” when subjected to large deformations. In startling contrast to the case of low filamin concentrations, filamin-to-actin molar ratios >1:133 produced actin filament networks that stiffened when subjected to large deformations (Fig. 4C). At high filamin concentrations, F-actin networks displayed a modulus independent of amplitude up to a deformation of ∼3% (22.Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), reducing the extent of the linear regime before undergoing a 60% increase of G for γ0 between 3 and 12% (Fig. 4E, inset). Despite the fact that F-actin is bundled for an actin-to-filamin molar ratio of 1:133 (2.Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), this strain-induced hardening phenomenon occurs (less strongly) in F-actin networks cross-linked by α-actinin but not the bona fide bundling protein fascin over a wide range of concentrations. As expected, this strain-hardening effect is more pronounced in the rigorous step shear assay (>50%, Fig. 4E, inset) than in the strain-sweep assay (17%, Fig. 3E), during which early filament breakage occurs. For γ0 > γc = 12%, filamin/F-actin networks finally softened (Fig. 4, D and E) more rapidly than in networks containing low filamin concentrations (Fig. 4, B and E). Indeed, for γ0 > γc, the modulus decreased as G(γ0) ∼ γ0–a (a = 1.4–1.8) at low filamin concentrations (Fig. 4B) and G(γ0) ∼ γ0–b (b = 2.3–2.4) at high filamin concentrations (Fig. 4E). The range of values for exponents a and b correspond to short (0.1 s) and long (100 s) time scales, respectively (Fig. 4, B and E). The rapid collapse of sheared F-actin/filamin networks past γc resembles that displayed by networks cross-linked/bundled by α-actinin and fascin (20.Doi M. Edwards S.F. The Theory of Polymer Dynamics. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar, 21.Ferry J.D. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980Google Scholar). The resilience of F-actin networks, defined here as the strain amplitude for which the shear modulus decreases below its baseline value, increased monotonically with increased filamin concentration (Fig. 4F). Filamin Helps Produce F-actin Networks that Are More Resilient, Stiffer, More Solid-like, and Less Dynamic than the F-actin Cross-linking/Bundling Proteins α-Actinin and Fascin—We compared systematically the rheological properties of actin filament networks in the presence of filamin to the properties of networks in the presence of fascin or α-actinin, two relatively well characterized actin-cross-linking/bundling proteins (16.Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24.Wachsstock D. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The resilience of F-actin networks containing filamin was dramatically higher than that of the two control networks. The resilience of F-actin/filamin networks was 5-fold higher than the resilience of F-actin/α-actinin networks and 10-fold higher than the resilience of F-actin/fascin networks (Fig. 5, A and B). Strain hardening, defined as the relative (maximum) increase of the shear modulus compared with its baseline value at small deformation amplitudes (i.e. in the linear regime) (Fig. 5A) (22.Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), was similar for F-actin/filamin and F-actin/α-actinin networks at low filamin concentrations (Fig. 5C). But strain hardening was much more pronounced in F-actin/filamin networks than in F-actin/α-actinin networks at high cross-linker concentrations (Fig. 5C). In contrast to filamin and α-actinin, fascin did not produce any measurable strain hardening in F-actin networks, even at high fascin concentrations (Fig. 5C). The maximum network elasticity reached by sweeping from low to high shear deformation amplitudes (see definition in Fig. 5A) was similar for F-actin/filamin and F-actin/α-actinin at low concentrations in cross-linking proteins but became much more pronounced at high filamin concentrations than at high α-actinin concentrations (Fig. 5D). As assessed by the frequency dependence of G′(ω), actin filament networks cross-linked/bundled by α-actinin or fascin were typically more dynamic than networks cross-linked/bundled by filamin, at least at high filamin concentrations (Fig. 6A). That difference in network dynamics diminished greatly at low filamin concentrations. The mean elasticity of F-actin networks measured at 1 radian/s was similar to for all tested cross-linkers at low concentrations (Fig. 6B). Here again, differences in stiffness became significant at high concentrations in actin-cross-linking proteins, with F-actin/filamin network by far the stiffest (Fig. 6B) and most solid-like (Fig. 6C) among the three tested types of cross-linked networks. The Rheological Behavior of F-actin/Filamin Networks Depends Critically on Filamin Concentration—Our results show that at steady state F-actin/filamin networks behave either as dynamic structures or as covalently cross-linked gels, depending on the local filamin concentration. This transition in rheological behavior occurs at the actin-to-filamin molar ratio for which actin filament organization changes from mostly orthogonal networks to bundles (3.Matsudaira P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). As indicated by the strong frequency dependence of G′(ω), F-actin/filamin networks are dynamic at filamin-to-actin molar ratios as high as 1:200. Following classical interpretations of polymer physics (20.Doi M. Edwards S.F. The Theory of Polymer Dynamics. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar, 23.Morse D.C. Macromolecules. 1998; 31: 7044-7067Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar), such a frequency profile suggests that actin filaments can relax the stress via fast lateral fluctuations between points of polymer overlaps at short time scales, creating a steep frequency dependence of G′(ω) at high frequency before these filament fluctuations encounter the constraining tube-like region formed by the entanglements of surrounding filaments, creating the beginning of a quasi-plateau at long time scales or low frequencies (Fig. 2A). Increasing filamin concentration eliminates progressively the frequency dependence of G′(ω) (Fig. 2A); polymer movements are constrained earlier (at higher frequencies) by cross-linkers, and longitudinal movements of filaments become prohibited (25.Palmer A. Xu J. Wirtz D. Rheologica Acta. 1998; 37: 97-108Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). If filamin were a true covalent cross-linker, even low filamin concentrations would stop all polymer motion in solution and render G′(ω) independent of frequency. Therefore, actin filament networks adopt a covalently cross-linked behavior at high filamin-to-actin molar ratios >1:200, because the number of cross-linking proteins per filament reaches a threshold beyond which the probability of all (dynamic) cross-linkers being detached from the filament simultaneously becomes zero (26.Xu J. Wirtz D. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9570-9576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The fact that we conducted these dynamic measurements at a strain amplitude that was explicitly verified to be within the linear regime eliminates the possibility that the low elasticity of F-actin/filamin at low filamin concentrations is due to filament breakage during the assay. The filamin concentration at which the mechanical transition occurs is between 0.12 μm and 0.18 μm for a 24 μm actin solution (Fig. 2B). Because the equilibrium Kd of phosphorylated chicken gizzard filamin for F-actin (Kd = 6.9 μm) (27.Ohta Y. Hartwig J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6745-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) is known, the number of filamin dimers attached to each filament in solution can be calculated. We find that that filamin concentrations of 0.12 μm and 0.18 μm correspond to molar ratios of F-actin-bound filamin dimers to actin of 1:515 and 1:129. Because the pitch of F-actin contains 28 actin subunits and is 72-nm long, these molar ratios correspond to average distances between F-actin-bound filamin dimers along each actin filament of ∼1.32 μm and 0.88 μm. Fluorescence microscopy reveals that actin filaments have an average length of 6.7 μm (28.Xu J. Casella J.F. Pollard T.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 42: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, the dramatic transition in the mechanical behavior and associated transition in network architecture observed in F-actin networks for filamin concentrations between 0.12 μm and 0.18 μm occur when the number of filamin dimers is increased from just ∼5 to 7.5 per actin filament. The Assay Traditionally Used to Probe the Effect of Large Deformations on Cytoskeletal Networks Is Ill-suited—The strain-sweep assay, which is traditionally used to assess the resilience and response of cytoskeleton networks to shear forces (13.Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15.Tang J.X. Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P. Ito T. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2208-2215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), is unsuitable for cytoskeletal networks because, at large deformation amplitudes, the stress becomes non-periodic and the stress amplitude decreases over time because of filament breakage/alignment during the assay itself. This is unacceptable because, by definition, the computation of G′ assumes that the stress is a periodic function (21.Ferry J.D. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980Google Scholar). Moreover, because at large deformation amplitudes filament breakage occurs during each measurement, the strain-dependent profiles of G′(γ0) and G″(γ0) depend on the number of measurements made. In the strain-sweep assay, networks are also subject to accumulated deformations that are much larger than suggested in the plots of G′ versus strain amplitude shown in the literature due to repeated oscillatory deformations at each nominal deformation amplitude. Therefore, the strain-sweep assay is based on unacceptable approximations. Here, we use a rigorous method to assay the mechanical response of F-actin/filamin networks to shear. This assay showed that the resilience and the strain-hardening response of actin networks were dramatically enhanced by the presence of filamin compared with α-actinin and fascin. In the absence of cross-linkers, actin filaments strain harden slightly (22.Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) due to the unfavorable shear-induced bending that occurs around topological overlaps between filaments (22.Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 29.Coulombe P.A. Bousquet O. Ma L. Yamada S. Wirtz D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 420-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The presence of cross-linkers further enhances this effect by reducing the possibility of filaments to slide past one another (22.Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which networks of the intermediate filaments display strain hardening is fundamentally different (29.Coulombe P.A. Bousquet O. Ma L. Yamada S. Wirtz D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 420-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Keratin intermediate filament is more flexible than F-actin, which should decrease the propensity of keratin networks to strain harden, but interactions between keratin polymers are pronounced (30.Yamada S. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 382-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31.Yamada S. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143 (45): 45Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, points of polymer entanglements in keratin networks are extremely long-lived, which promotes pronounced strain hardening when networks are subject to large shear deformations. It is important to note that, over the tested range of filamin concentrations, the linear regime of deformations extends well beyond 1%, the strain amplitude at which our dynamic measurements were conducted. This justifies our use of 1% strain deformation amplitudes in dynamic measurements (shown in Fig. 2). It also suggests that the reduced network elasticity at low filamin concentrations and low frequency (Fig. 2A) is not due to shear-induced polymer breakage during the experiments as suggested previously (13.Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 14.Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Kas J. Lerche D. Maggs A. Sackmann E. Schliwa M. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32503-32513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but reflects the dynamic nature of filamin subject to low, non-destructive, shear deformation amplitudes. Mechanical Behavior of Filamin Compared with α-Actinin and Fascin—The gelation profile of F-actin in the presence of high concentrations of filamin goes through a distinct maximum. Interestingly, a similar non-monotonic gelation kinetics is displayed by polymerizing actin networks in the presence of the stereotypical F-actin-bundling protein fascin (16.Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This singular non-monotonic gelation reflects a partial collapse of the network structure profile due to the formation of actin bundles (21.Ferry J.D. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980Google Scholar). This gelation behavior is not displayed by F-actin networks in the presence of the stereotypical F-actin cross-linking/bundling protein α-actinin even at α-actinin molar ratios >1:10 (19.Tseng Y. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1643-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 32.Tseng Y. An K.M. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) for which α-actinin bundles F-actin, presumably because the α-actinin-mediated F-actin bundles themselves are cross-linked (33.Tseng Y. Kole T.P. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3162-3176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that they seem to possess very similar structures and functions (34.Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar), α-actinin and filamin display different mechanical responses at different frequencies, strain amplitudes, and concentrations. The fact that these two cytoskeleton proteins localize to the base of cell surface protrusions and in stress fibers of adherent cells (1.van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) suggests that α-actinin and filamin do not have redundant mechanical functions. Our recent work suggests instead that these two proteins may work synergistically to provide the cytoskeleton with enhanced stiffness and resilience (32.Tseng Y. An K.M. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33.Tseng Y. Kole T.P. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3162-3176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The mechanical properties of actin networks will depend not only on the kon and koff of the actin-binding protein for F-actin and the relative concentrations of the auxiliary proteins and actin (which are controlled), but also on the intrinsic molecular flexibility of the cross-linker. Clearly, electron microscopy is unsuitable for probing the flexibility of the F-actin cross-linkers, especially when these cross-linkers are under mechanical tension. The flexibility of cross-linking proteins is just starting to be investigated through single-molecule techniques. Atomic force microscopy studies of the flexibility of fragments of α-actinin (the spectrin-like repeat domain) and filamin (the immunoglobulin-like domain) have just appeared (35.Furuike S. Ito T. Yamazaki M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36.Rief M. Pascual J. Saraste M. Gaub H.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Therefore, we ought to postpone the description of a predictive model that would relate the structure, binding kinetics, and molecular flexibility of F-actin cross-linking molecules (e.g. α-actinin, fascin, and filamin) to the F-actin networks morphology and rheology when these biochemical and biophysical parameters are known. The dual role of filamin in controlling simultaneously the architecture and mechanics of F-actin networks suggests an important physiological function. Filamin localizes both in actin-rich lamellae and actin stress fibers of adherent cells (37.Langanger G. de Mey J. Moeremans M. Daneels G. de Brabander M. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1324-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). At the edge of the cell where filamin has been shown to be present (8.Flanagan L.A. Chou J. Falet H. Neujahr R. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), F-actin forms orthogonal networks containing X, Y, and T junctions mediated by F-actin cross-linking proteins. This is the region of the cell where fast remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is required, but where reasonably high stiffness is also required to allow for net pushing forces produced by polymerizing actin against the cell membrane (38.Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar). This combined orthogonal architecture and stiffness could readily be provided by low concentrations in filamin. In contrast, stable F-actin bundles lying on the ventral side of adherent cells require high stretchability to allow contractility, which can be provided in part by high concentrations in filamin. As assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy (8.Flanagan L.A. Chou J. Falet H. Neujahr R. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 37.Langanger G. de Mey J. Moeremans M. Daneels G. de Brabander M. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1324-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and immunogold staining combined with electron microscopy (37.Langanger G. de Mey J. Moeremans M. Daneels G. de Brabander M. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1324-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the concentration in filamin at the edge of the cells is indeed not as high as the local concentration in F-actin bundles. Hence, the biphasic behavior observed in the architecture and mechanical function may be due in part to the spatial distribution and dual mechanical function of filamin.

https://openalex.org/W1967483524,"Escherichia coli has eight genes predicted to encode sulfurtransferases having the active site consensus sequence Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Gly. One of these genes, ybbB, is frequently found within bacterial operons that contain selD, the selenophosphate synthetase gene, suggesting a role in selenium metabolism. We show that ybbB is required in vivo for the specific substitution of selenium for sulfur in 2-thiouridine residues in E. coli tRNA.

Nucleoside analysis of tRNAs from wild-type and ybbB mutant strains revealed that production of mnm5se2U is lost in the ybbB mutant but that 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, the mnm5se2U precursor, is unaffected by deletion of ybbB. Thus, ybbB is not required for the initial sulfurtransferase reaction but rather encodes a 2-selenouridine synthase that replaces a sulfur atom in 2-thiouridine in tRNA with selenium. Purified 2-selenouridine synthase containing a C-terminal His6 tag exhibited spectral properties consistent with tRNA bound to the enzyme. In vitro mnm5se2U synthesis is shown to be dependent on 2-selenouridine synthase, SePO3, and tRNA. Finally, we demonstrate that the conserved Cys97 (but not Cys96) in the rhodanese sequence motif Cys96-Cys97-Xaa-Xaa-Gly is required for 2-selenouridine synthase in vivo activity. These data are consistent with the ybbB gene encoding a tRNA 2-selenouridine synthase and identifies a new role for the rhodanese homology domain in enzymes.

Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 736-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Stadtman T.C. Davis J.N. Zehelein E. Bock A. BioFactors. 1989; 2: 35-44PubMed Google Scholar). Although the pathway of selenium incorporation into protein is known in E. coli and related bacteria (1.Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), the steps or enzymes involved in the incorporation of selenium into tRNAs are not completely defined. It is known that 2-selenouridine is derived from 2-thiouridine by replacement of the sulfur with selenium (Scheme 1) (9.Wittwer A.J. Stadtman T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10.Mihara H. Kato S. Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. Kennedy R.A.J.D. Kurihara T. Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. Esaki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6679-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A partially purified enzyme from S. typhimurium, termed tRNA 2-selenouridine synthase, was shown to catalyze the ATP-independent conversion of 2-thiouridine in tRNA to 2-selenouridine when supplied with selenophosphate (11.Veres Z. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8092-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, neither the gene encoding tRNA 2-selenouridine synthase nor the 2-selenouridine synthase reaction mechanism has been defined. Sulfurtransferases containing a rhodanese homology domain are ubiquitous proteins that catalyze the transfer of a sulfur atom from thiosulfate (rhodanese) or from 3-mercaptopyruvate (mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase) to thiophilic sulfur acceptors such as cyanide in vitro (12.Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The rhodanese homology domain has a conserved cysteine residue that participates in catalysis (12.Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The ∼110-amino acid rhodanese domain may comprise the entire protein, as in the GlpE and PspE rhodaneses of E. coli (13.Ray W.K. Potters M.B. Mansuri A.M. Larson T.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 181: 2277-2284Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 14.Adams H. Teertstra W. Koster M. Tommassen J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), or the domain may be fused to other protein domains of known or unknown function. Other rhodaneses and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferases contain two rhodanese homology domains, but only the C-terminal domain contains an active site cysteine that participates in catalysis (12.Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Certain ThiI proteins, including that of E. coli, contain a C-terminal rhodanese homology domain fused to an N-terminal domain that is involved in biosynthesis of the thiazole ring of thiamin and 4-thiouridine of tRNAs (15.Palenchar P.M.

Recent investigations aimed at defining the physiological functions of sulfurtransferases suggested involvement of these enzymes in selenium metabolism. Interestingly, it was found that incubation of bovine rhodanese with selenite in the presence of glutathione resulted in formation of an equimolar rhodanese-selenium adduct that was capable of serving as a selenium donor for selenophosphate synthetase (19.Ogasawara Y. Lacourciere G. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 171320998Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, we have observed that the selD operon of certain bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains a second gene homologous to E. coli ybbB 2The uncharacterized gene was initially designated ybbB based on its location in a group of ybb genes located between 11 and 12 min on the E. coli 100-min chromosome. (see Fig. 1), one of eight E. coli genes predicted to encode proteins with a rhodanese homology domain. In this work, an E. coli mutant deficient in ybbB was constructed and was found to be incapable of incorporating selenium into tRNA. However, synthesis of 2-thiouridine in tRNA by the mutant was unaffected in vivo. Purified YbbB protein contained tightly bound tRNA and exhibited tRNA 2-selenouridine synthase activity. The rhodanese homology domain of the 2-selenouridine synthase has two adjacent cysteine residues at its putative active site. The second cysteine residue (Cys97) of 2-selenouridine synthase that aligns most closely with the conserved active site cysteine of the rhodanese homology domain was found to be essential for activity in vivo. These results indicate that the rhodanese homology domain functions in selenium transfer from selenophosphate during conversion of 2-thiouridine to 2-selenouridine in bacterial tRNA.

Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). Gene disruption targeting vector pFRT-K was constructed by introducing a kanamycin resistance cassette (Kmr) flanked by FRT sites (FLP recombinase site) from pCP15 (22.Cherepanov P.P. Wackernagel W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pBluescript-KS+ (Stratagene). Thus, pFRT-K contains multiple cloning sites on each side of the Kmr cassette for cloning chromosomal DNA sequences that target the gene disruption. The Kmr cassette can be excised from chromosomal insertion sites upon introduction of pCP20, which provides FLP recombinase upon thermal induction (22.Cherepanov P.P. Wackernagel W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). For construction of the ybbB knock-out strain, a 182-bp fragment ending 52 bp upstream of the ybbB initiation codon was amplified by PCR using primers BNFI (ACTGGTCgaCCGGGTAATCCCAAC; mismatches to create the underlined restriction sites are indicated in lowercase letters) and BNRI (CAAGGAAgCTTGATTTTTAACTGC) (see Fig. 1). A 119-bp fragment consisting of the 3′-flanking region of ybbB including 22 bp from the C-terminal end of ybbB was amplified using primers BCFI (GGCGGAATtcGTTAAGGCGCGG) and BCRI (ATAAGGATcCGACACTCATATC). The C-terminal PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into the same sites of pFRT-K creating pFA150. Subsequently the N-terminal PCR product was digested with HindIII and SalI and cloned into the same sites of pFA150, creating pFA151. pFA151 was linearized with SalI and BamHI, and the DNA fragment harboring the Kmr -FRT cassette flanked by regions of ybbB was introduced by transformation into strain BW25113(pKD46) by selecting for kanamycin resistance, yielding strain FA026. The Kmr cassette of FA026 was excised by FLP recombinase-mediated homologous recombination between the FRT sites flanking the Kmr cassette, yielding strain FA027. Colonies with the ybbB gene deletion were verified by PCR using primers YBBB2 (AAGGCCATGTGTCAGATCtAGTCG) and BCRI, which generated PCR products of the expected sizes (1372 and 328 bp) for the wild-type and ybbB-deleted strain, respectively. The chromosomal location of ybbB::Kmr was verified by showing the anticipated 43% cotransduction frequency of ybbB::Kmr with a nearby Tn10 insertion (purK79::Tn10). The purK79::Tn10 marker was introduced into strain FA026 by P1 transduction creating strain FA029 (Table I). A P1 lysate of strain FA029 was made, and ybbB::Kmr was subsequently moved to strain TL524 by P1 transduction, with selection for tetracycline resistance, generating FA031. The Kmr cassette was excised from strain FA031 by FLP recombinase, creating strain FA034 (ΔybbB). Construction of the YbbB Expression Plasmid—The gene for ybbB was amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers ybbBF (CTTTTAcaTATGCAAGAGAGACAC) and ybbBHisR (TCCCgtcgacCCGCGCCTTAACCCATTC), respectively (see Fig. 1). After PCR, the NdeI-SalI fragment was cloned into pGZ117 (23.Zeng G. Larson T.J. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 822-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) between the T7 promoter and the region encoding a His6 affinity tag and thrombin cleavage site generating pFA204. The cloning procedure resulted in expression of YbbB-H with the C-terminal amino acid sequence AR|VDLVPR*GSH6, where the vertical line indicates fusion to YbbB and the asterisk indicates a thrombin cleavage site. The ybbB region of pFA204 was sequenced and found to be entirely correct. Construction of Cys-Ser Variants of YbbB—Expression vectors for production of C96S and C97S variants of YbbB were constructed by PCR amplification of the region containing the two cysteines using pFA204 as the template and ybbBF and BBCS-1 (AATTGCCACGGGCGCAGCtGAGAATACC; italicized bold serine codon) or ybbBF and BBCS-2 (AATTGCCACGGGCGCtGCAGAGAATACC) as primers (see Fig. 1). After amplification, PCR products were digested with NdeI and BtgI and cloned into the same sites of pFA204, replacing the wild-type sequence. The 300-bp NdeI-BtgI regions of the resulting plasmids were subsequently sequenced and found to be correct. The C96S and C97S variants of YbbB are encoded by pFA218 and pFA210, respectively. In Vivo Analysis of 75Se Labeling—Incorporation of selenium into protein and tRNA was determined by growing 12-ml anaerobic cultures of E. coli strains in LB-Amp supplemented with 1% glucose and 0.1 μm Na2SeO3 (20 μCi of 75Se). The cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, disrupted by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Selenium incorporation was analyzed by electrophoresis of the extracts on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using PhosphoImager detection. Bulk tRNA was isolated from the same extracts using the method previously described (9.Wittwer A.J. Stadtman T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and nucleoside analysis was performed as described (24.Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. McCune R.A. Gerhardt K.O. Agris P.F. J. Chromatogr. 1982; 230: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Isolated tRNA (50 μl) was first digested at pH 5.3 with 6 units of P1 nuclease at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of 0.65 mm ZnSO4. The pH of the reaction was then adjusted to pH 8.5 by the addition of Tris-HCl buffer, and the sample was brought to 50 mm MgSO4 and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Five units of alkaline phosphatase (bacterial or shrimp) were added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 3 h. Digestion was terminated by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation and removal of precipitated protein. Nucleoside separation was performed by HPLC using an analytical reversed phase C18 column (Vydac) and the following program: 0–25 min (0–3.5% methanol in 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.3), 25–35 min (3.5–15% methanol), and 35–45 min (100% methanol wash). The nucleosides were detected by electronic absorption at 254 and 313 nm, and 75Se was measured using a Radioflow Detector LB508 (EG&G Berthold) placed in-line immediately after the optical detection unit. Expression and Purification of Enzymes—Selenophosphate synthetase was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as described (25.Veres Z. Kim I.Y. Scholz T.D. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10597-10603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because selenophosphate synthetase requires K+ and is inhibited by Na+, all of the buffers were adjusted using HCl and KOH. 2-Selenouridine synthase and its Cys → Ser variants were expressed in E. coli BL21 Star(DE3). Competent cells were transformed with pFA204, pFA218, or pFA210 to generate overexpressing strains producing His-tagged 2-selenouridine synthase or its variants. Overnight cultures grown in Luria broth medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) were used to inoculate a fermentor containing 10 liters of the same medium. After growth at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5, the temperature was reduced to 23 °C, and 2-selenouridine synthase synthesis was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.4 mm). The cells were harvested after 3 h of induction. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol) containing 10 mm imidazole and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. For purification, the frozen cell suspension was thawed, DNase I was added, and the cells were disrupted by sonication. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 1 h at 33,000 × g, the clarified extract was mixed with 1.5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole. The slurry was stirred slowly for 1 h, transferred to a column, and washed with buffer A with 10 mm imidazole followed by a second wash with 20 mm imidazole. Each wash was maintained until the optical absorption at 280 nm reached base line. 2-Selenouridine synthase was eluted by application of buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol) and applied to a 10-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in buffer B. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer B, and adsorbed protein was eluted by application of a 0.2-liter linear gradient of 0–0.5 M KCl in buffer B. The fractions containing pure 2-selenouridine synthase (>95% pure determined by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon 30 (Amicon). Following dialysis against 50 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, the aliquots were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at –80 °C. Approximately 50 g of wet cell paste yielded 10 mg of pure 2-selenouridine synthase. In Vitro Assay of 5-Methylaminomethyl-2-selenouridine Formation— 2-Selenouridine synthase assays were performed in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratories) maintained at <5 ppm O2. All of the reaction mixtures (200 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 20 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 100 μm HSe– (10 μCi of H75Se–), 10 μm selenophosphate synthetase, and 50 μm bulk tRNA isolated from strain FA034 (ΔybbB) as indicated. The reaction mixtures were incubated with HSe– initially at ambient temperature (∼23 °C) for 10 min. Then 2-selenouridine synthase (or variant enzyme) was added to 5 μm, and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min at ambient temperature. The reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of Tris-buffered phenol followed by the addition of dithiothreitol and NaCl to 0.05 and 1.0 m, respectively. The samples were thoroughly vortexed, and the phases were separated by centrifugation. The product, [75Se]mnm5se2U, was identified by HPLC as described above for in vivo experiments. Routine measurements of selenium incorporation into tRNA were performed by first precipitating tRNA from the aqueous phase and thoroughly washing the tRNA pellets with cold 70% ethanol. The pellets were dried and resuspended in 25 μl of H2O, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Other Procedures—HSe– was prepared from Na2SeO3 in an anaerobic chamber by reduction with NaBH4 according to a published procedure (26.Klayman D.L. Griffin T.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 197-199Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar). HSe– containing H75Se– was prepared by reducing a neutralized stock solution of 75SeO32 with 80 mm dithiothreitol and dilution into HSe–. Formate dehydrogenase activity was determined using the benzyl viologen overlay assay as described (27.Ikemura T. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Methods for the isolation and digestion of unfractionated tRNA for mnm5s2U analysis by HPLC were performed as previously described (28.Lauhon C.T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6820-6829Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Protein was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein reagent and bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein purity was judged by SDS-PAGE (10 or 12%) using Gelcode Blue stain (Pierce) for detection. tRNA staining was performed by soaking SDS gels in a 0.5 μg/ml solution of ethidium bromide for 30 min at room temperature. The concentration of denatured 2-selenouridine synthase was determined by first precipitating the protein by heating at 95 °C for 5 min followed by centrifugation. The supernatant containing tRNA was removed, and the protein pellet was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 6 m guanidine HCl. The UV spectrum of this sample was recorded, and the molar extinction coefficient determined from the protein sequence (57,300 m–1 cm–1) was used to calculate the 2-selenouridine synthase concentration. The spectrum of the native enzyme was recorded in 50 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 8.0, 20 mm KCl. The samples were subjected to DNase and RNase digestion in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2 using 2 units of RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) and 5 μg/ml bovine pancreatic RNase A (Sigma), respectively, at 37 °C for 30 min and quenched by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. All HPLC procedures were performed using a Hewlett Packard 1100 series system. Electronic absorption measurements were made using a Cary Bio 100 spectrophotometer. Identification and Cloning of ybbB—With the exception of the ThiI protein of E. coli, which is involved in thiamin and 4-thiouridine biosynthesis, the physiological functions of bacterial proteins containing a rhodanese homology domain are presently unknown. The genome sequence of E. coli predicts the presence of eight proteins with the rhodanese homology domain. One of these proteins, YbbB, is a multidomain protein consisting of an N-terminal rhodanese homology domain and a second domain containing a P-loop (Walker A) motif (Fig. 1A). The P-loop motif is found in proteins that bind ATP or GTP (29.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4257) Google Scholar, 30.Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). There is also a region at the extreme C terminus of YbbB (residues 324–356) that has sequence similarity to a portion of the so-called helical region of isoleucyl tRNA synthetases. The helical region contributes to binding of the anticodon loop of the tRNA (31.Silvian L.F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Evaluation of the genomic context of ybbB in sequenced genomes revealed that this gene is occasionally present as the second gene in an operon that also contains selD, encoding selenophosphate synthetase (Fig. 1B). This discovery suggested that YbbB also participates in selenium metabolism and provided a rationale for the genetic and biochemical analysis reported here. In Vivo Analysis of YbbB Activity—To test the hypothesis that the ybbB gene product functions in selenium metabolism, we generated an E. coli ybbB deletion mutant (strain FA034). The ybbB mutant had no obvious growth defect when tested on rich or minimal growth medium. Both the wild-type (TL524) and knock-out strains were grown under anaerobic conditions in media supplemented with 0.1 μm selenite (20 μCi of 75Se) and analyzed for selenium-containing proteins and tRNA. Fig. 2 shows electrophoretic analysis of soluble extracts from wild-type and ΔybbB strains (lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Both strains incorporated 75Se into formate dehydrogenase H, a selenocysteine-containing enzyme, and also had measurable formate dehydrogenase H activity (benzyl viologen overlay assay; data not shown) indicating that the pathway of incorporation of selenium into specific selenocysteine residues in proteins is not affected by disruption of the ybbB gene. In contrast, 75Se incorporation into tRNA was completely lost when ybbB is disrupted, indicating that the gene product functions in the pathway of mnm5se2U formation in tRNA. Transformation of FA034 (ΔybbB) with a plasmid bearing intact ybbB (pFA204, lane 3) complemented the deletion and restored 75Se incorporation into tRNA. Previous studies have shown that sulfur-modified tRNA (2-thiouridine) is required as a substrate for the selenotransferase reaction (9.Wittwer A.J. Stadtman T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that YbbB participates in the sulfurtransferase step of mnm5se2U assembly and that its deletion prevents production of substrate for the selenotransferase reaction, production of mnm5s2U in tRNA was compared in the wild-type and ΔybbB mutant strains. Fig. 3 shows the results of tRNA nucleoside analysis from wild-type (Fig. 3A) and ΔybbB (Fig. 3C) strains, which show identical patterns of production of mnm5s2U, indicating that disruption of ybbB has no affect on 2-thiouridine generation. Also shown is the nucleoside analysis of a ΔmnmA strain, which is defective in the production of mnm5s2U (32.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Purification and Physical Characterization of 2-Selenouridine Synthase—The in vivo results described above strongly suggest that the ybbB gene product is tRNA 2-selenouridine synthase. To further characterize the enzyme, a ybbB overexpression system was constructed to generate sufficient quantities for purification and subsequent in vitro analysis of mnm5se2U formation. All of the purification steps required the presence of a reducing agent, eit"
https://openalex.org/W2037905095,"The FYVE domain is a conserved protein motif characterized by its ability to bind with high affinity and specificity to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), a phosphoinositide highly enriched in early endosomes. The PI(3)P polar head group contacts specific amino acid residues that are conserved among FYVE domains. Despite full conservation of these residues, the ability of different FYVE domains to bind to endosomes in cells is highly variable. Here we show that the endosomal localization in intact cells absolutely requires structural features intrinsic to the FYVE domain in addition to the PI(3)P binding pocket. These features are involved in FYVE domain dimerization and in interaction with the membrane bilayer. These interactions, which are determined by non-conserved residues, are likely to be essential for the temporal and spatial control of protein associations at the membrane-cytosol interface within the endocytic pathway. The FYVE domain is a conserved protein motif characterized by its ability to bind with high affinity and specificity to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), a phosphoinositide highly enriched in early endosomes. The PI(3)P polar head group contacts specific amino acid residues that are conserved among FYVE domains. Despite full conservation of these residues, the ability of different FYVE domains to bind to endosomes in cells is highly variable. Here we show that the endosomal localization in intact cells absolutely requires structural features intrinsic to the FYVE domain in addition to the PI(3)P binding pocket. These features are involved in FYVE domain dimerization and in interaction with the membrane bilayer. These interactions, which are determined by non-conserved residues, are likely to be essential for the temporal and spatial control of protein associations at the membrane-cytosol interface within the endocytic pathway. The FYVE domain is a double zinc finger named after the first four proteins found to contain this motif (Fab1, YotB, Vac1p, and EEA1) (1Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol.

Observations such as these have suggested that the ability of FYVE domains to localize to early endosomes may be determined by structural features distinct from those directly involved in PI(3)P binding (10Misra S. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, there is very little sequence conservation among FYVE domains in regions that do not directly contact the Ins(1,3)P2 group. Thus, the molecular basis for the differing ability of FYVE domains to localize to endosomes remains unknown. To resolve this question, we have systematically analyzed the cellular localization of a series of isolated FYVE domains from the mammalian proteins EEA1, Hrs, SARA, FGD1, and frabin. Beyond the FYVE domain, there are no functional or structural similarities among these proteins, and they each have been hypothesized to fulfill distinct cellular functions (13Estrada L. Caron E.

With the exception of one residue in the FYVE domain of FGD1, all these FYVE domains contain the specific residues that directly contact PI(3)P, and all bind to PI(3)P in vitro. However, as shown here, the ability of these domains to interact with endosomes when expressed in intact cells varies greatly. A comparative analysis of the structural features within these FYVE domains that correlate with in vivo endosome binding reveals a crucial role for two variable regions within the FYVE domain: a stretch of 4 amino acids adjacent to the conserved positively charged RRHHCR region (the “turret loop”) and a region toward the N terminus of the FYVE domain that forms the interface between FYVE domain dimers in the crystal structure of the EEA1 C terminus (6Dumas J.J.

These structural differences among FYVE domains provide an evolutionary mechanism for controlling the extent and duration of the interaction between specific FYVE domain-containing proteins and early endosomes. Construction of EGFP-FYVE Domains—The FYVE domain of human EEA1-(1305-1411) and mouse Hrs-(147-223) were inserted into pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) at the SalI and BamHI sites. The FYVE domain of human SARA-(589-656), mouse frabin-(549-618), and human FGD1-(717-789) were inserted into pEGFP-C1 vector at the BglII and SalI sites. Construction of EGFP-FKBP Mutants—The ARGENT™ regulated homodimerization kit was obtained from ARIAD Pharmaceuticals. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged-FKBP mutant (Fv-HA) was amplified by PCR and was inserted into pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) at the BspEI and BglII sites (pEGFP-Fv). The FYVE domain of human EEA1-(1305-1411, 1305-1411dm and 1337-1411), and mouse Hrs-(147-223) were inserted into pEGFP-Fv vector at the SalI and BamHI sites. The FYVE domains of human SARA-(589-656), mouse frabin-(549-618), and human FGD1-(717-789), as well a mutant of these, were inserted into pEGFP-Fv vector at the BglII and SalI sites. Mutations were constructed by the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—The FYVE domain of SARA-(582-668) was subcloned into pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs). The EEA1-FYVE domain (1336-1411) was subcloned into a modified pET-15b vector containing an N-terminal His6 tag (MGHHHHHHGS). Constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene), and cells were grown at 25 °C to an A600 of 0.4-0.6 and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h. The MBP fusion protein of the SARA-FYVE domain was purified using amylose agarose resin (New England Biolabs), and His6 fusions of EEA1-FYVE domain were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads (Qiagen). All fusion proteins were further purified to homogeneity by anion exchange chromatography over Source Q (Amersham Biosciences) and gel filtration chromatography over Superdex-200 (Amersham Biosciences). For gel filtration experiments, the column was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol and were eluted with the same buffer. The column was calibrated with ribonuclease (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), aldolasae (179 kDa), and ferritin (386 kDa). Cell Culture and Transfection to HeLa or COS7 Cells—HeLa or Cos-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Expression vectors were transfected into HeLa cells using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) or by calcium phosphate precipitation method for experiments involving the live cell fast microscopy. Fluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells were grown to 40-50% confluence on coverslips and transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated with or without 100 nm AP20187 at 37 °C for 30 min. The coverslips were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature, and imaged using a conventional wide field microscope fitted with a ×100 objective (Zeiss). Images were acquired with a cooled CCD camera and Axivision software. Live Cell Imaging—HeLa cells were transfected with eGFP-tagged constructs, and after 48 h, they were imaged using high speed, three-dimensional microscopy (31Patki V. Buxton J. Chawla A. Lifshitz L.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 288-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Exposure times of 5 ms were used to acquire each of 21 optical sections, spaced by 250 nm. Each set of 21 optical sections was acquired in less than 1 s, allowing 20 ms for each 250-nm shift in focus. Stacks were acquired every 10 s for 20 continuous minutes. The haze originating from light sources outside the in-focus plane of the cell was reduced by image restoration (31Patki V. Buxton J. Chawla A. Lifshitz L. Fogarty K. Carrington W. Tuft R. Corvera S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 32Rizzuto R. Carrington W. Tuft R.A.

Each stack of three-dimensional image was projected into a single two-dimensional image, and selected images were illustrated in each figure. For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis, CFP and YFP donor/acceptor pairs were imaged using a Coherent Argon laser tuned to 458 nm, a wavelength at which both fluorophores were simultaneously excited. The camera field was split into two subfields of 128 × 60 pixels using a dual view module (Optical Insights, Santa Fe, NM). The donor and acceptor fields were filtered by 480/30- and 535/40-emission filters, respectively. This optical configuration ensured true simultaneity of donor/acceptor excitation and emission. For analysis of donor recovery after acceptor photobleaching, the intensity of the 458 laser beam was measured using a model 1815-C power meter with a 818-UV detector (Newport Corp., Irvine CA). A single three-dimensional image stack was acquired as described above. Then, the laser was retuned to 514 nm, and the power was increased by a factor of 5. The specimen was exposed for 2 min, with which more than 90% bleaching was routinely obtained. The laser was then retuned to 458 nm, and power was adjusted to be within 2% of the power used for the acquisition of the initial image stack. A second image stack was then obtained. Controls expressing only YFP- or only CFP-FYVE domain constructs were used to determine the percent of YFP fluorescence in the CFP channel and vice versa. These values were substracted from the images obtained from cells coexpressing both fluorophores. The real YFP and CFP fluorescence intensity in the total volume of the cell was then used to calculate the YFP/CFP ratios shown. Liposome Binding Assay—Cos-7 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 2 days after transfection, cells were treated with 500 nm wortmannin for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were placed on ice and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then washed one time in cytosol buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 0.01 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, 1 mm 1,10-phenatroline, 10 mm benazimidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 500 nm wortmannin) and swollen in a 1:10 dilution of cytosol buffer in water for 10 min on ice. Cells were scraped from the plate and homogenized by repeated passage (30×) through a 27.5-gauge needle. The homogenate was spun at 1000 × g to remove nuclei and unbroken cells, and the postnuclear supernatant was spun at 200,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain the cytosolic extract. The cytosolic extracts were divided into two aliquots; one aliquot was treated with 100 nm AP20187, and the other was incubated with an equivalent volume of vehicle (ethanol) for 30 min at 37 °C. Aliquots of treated or non-treated cytosol (100 μl) were incubated with 50 μl of liposomes (1 mg/ml total lipid) composed of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and the indicated amounts of PI(3)P for 15 min at room temperature (Patki et al. (4Patki V. Virbasius J. Lane W.S. Toh B.H. Shpetner H.S. Corvera S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7326-7330Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar)). The liposomes were collected by centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 10 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunobloting with anti-GFP antibodies. Ligand Binding Experiments—His6-EEA1 and dimeric form of MBP-SARA constructs at concentrations of 1-5 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl were titrated with aliquots of Ins(1,3)P2. Samples were excited at 290 nm (2-nm band pass), and emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm (1-nm band pass) using a spectrofluorimeter. The magnitude of fluorescence quenching (ΔI) was calculated from ΔI = I - Io, where I is the integrated emission spectrum at a given free-ligand concentration (L) and Io is the integrated emission spectrum without ligand. Values for the dissociation constant (Kd) were obtained by a non-linear least square fit to a simple two state binding model ΔI = C × (L)/(Kd + [L]), where C is a constant. Subcellular Localization of Isolated FYVE Domains—Initial analysis of GFP fusion proteins of the FYVE domain constructs depicted in Fig. 1A revealed dramatic differences in their subcellular localization (Fig. 1B). Salient among these differences was the ability of the FYVE domain of SARA to strongly localize to intracellular membrane structures, likely to represent early endosomes. In contrast, the FYVE domains of the other proteins tested were primarily if not exclusively cytoplasmic over a wide range of expression levels. This exceptional ability to bind to endosomal membranes could be due to inherent differences in the binding affinity of the SARA FYVE domain for the Ins(1,3)P2 head group. To directly test this possibility, the affinity of purified FYVE domains of EEA1 and SARA for the Ins(1,3)P2 head group was measured by monitoring tryptophan fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 2, the affinity of the MBP-FYVE domain of SARA for Ins(1,3)P2 is, if anything, slightly lower than that of EEA1. Thus, differences in head group binding affinity are not able to explain the differences in endosomal targeting by these domains. Another feature of FYVE domains that may influence their ability to associate with endosomal membranes in vivo is their ability to form oligomers, through interactions between regions within the FYVE domain and/or interactions in regions outside the FYVE domain, which may vary from protein to protein. To maintain these regions extrinsic to the FYVE domain constant, each of the FYVE domains studied was fused to the protein FKBP (F36V, hereafter Fv), which homodimerizes in the presence of the small cell-permeable bivalent molecule, AP20187 (Yang et al. (42Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Narula S. Rollins C.T. Yuan R. Andrade L.J. Ram M.K. Phillips T.B. van Schravendijk M.R. Dalgarno D. Clackson T. Holt D.A. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)). As shown before, GFP-Fv-FYVE(Hrs) was found diffusely distributed in the cytosol (Fig. 3A) but displayed a dramatic translocation to vesicular structures within 10 min following the addition of AP20187. The dimerizer-induced translocation of eGFP-Fv-FYVE(Hrs) to endosomal membranes was virtually abolished by pretreatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (not shown), demonstrating its dependence on PI(3)P binding. Binding GFP-Fv-FYVE(Hrs) to liposomes containing 5% PI(3)P was also greatly increased in the presence of dimerizer (Fig. 3B). The formation of a very high affinity homodimer was evidenced by the presence of a product of twice the apparent molecular mass of the monomer in these immunoblots. These results indicate that homodimerization of FYVE domains can provide the avidity for PI(3)P required to target to early endosomes. The SARA FYVE Domain Forms Oligomers in Intact Cells—The results shown above suggest that the ability of the FYVE domains to interact with endosomes is strongly influenced by their oligomeric state. Thus, the ability of the isolated FYVE domain of SARA to associate with endosomes may reside in its ability to form oligomers without the need for regions outside the FYVE domain. To determine whether indeed the SARA FYVE domain forms oligomeric structures in live cells, we utilized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). To first determine whether FYVE domain dimers might be capable of undergoing FRET, CFP-Fv and YFP-Fv fusions of the FYVE domain of Hrs were co-expressed in Cos 7 cells. In the absence of dimerizer, these proteins were diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, as shown for the eGFP construct in Fig. 3A. To determine whether formation of dimers in the cytoplasm would elicit FRET, cells were treated previously with LY294002, a reversible inhibitor of PI 3-kinase that inhibits FYVE domain recruitment to these membranes. Cells were then exposed to AP20187, and the fluorescence in the CFP and YFP channels was monitored quasicontinuously, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 4). Within seconds after the addition of dimerizer, a clear decrease in fluorescence in the CFP channel was observed. No similar decrease was observed in control experiments in which cells expressing only CFP-Fv-FYVE(Hrs) were subjected to similar illumination intensities and times (not illustrated). Simultaneously, a significant increase in the ratio of YFP to CFP fluorescence was detected, suggesting that the decrease in CFP fluorescence was due to quenching of the CFP signal by the YFP fluorophore. Removal of LY294002 by three rapid successive washes caused the recruitment of Hrs-FYVE constructs to endosomes and an abrupt increase in the YFP to CFP fluorescence ratio. Although the cause of this increase is not clear, it may be due to an enhanced FRET efficiency when intramolecular motion is restricted to the two-dimensional plane of the endosomal surface. In any case, the results of this experiment indicate that FRET can be used as a measure of dimerization state of CFP- and YFP-FYVE domain constructs in the cytoplasm and on the endosomal surface. To further substantiate this result, the unquenching of CFP fluorescence after photobleaching of YFP was monitored. Cells transfected with CFP- and YFP-Fv-FYVE(Hrs) were treated with AP20187, and images in the YFP and CFP channels were recorded (Fig. 5A, left panels). Cells were then subjected to 2 min of high intensity illumination at a wavelength of 514 nm, which resulted in a 90% decrease of YFP fluorescence. Images in the YFP and CFP channels were subsequently recorded. An increase in the fluorescence intensity in the CFP channel could be detected concomitant with a decrease in YFP fluorescence (Fig. 5A, right panels). Thus, FRET between FYVE domain dimers could be detected both by direct measurement of the YFP to CFP ratio upon dimerization (Fig. 4) and by unquenching of donor after acceptor photobleaching in previously assembled dimers (Fig. 5). Using this later approach, cells expressing CFP- and YFP-FYVE(SARA) devoid of the Fv moiety were analyzed. Fig. 5, B and C, illustrates the pronounced unquenching of CFP fluorescence after YFP photobleaching in cells co-expressing CFP- and YFP-FYVE(SARA), suggesting strongly the existence of dimers of the SARA FYVE domain. However, another possibility would be that intermolecular FRET between monomers of CFP- and YFP-FYVE(SARA) concentrated on the endosomal surface could also occur. To test this possibility, CFP-FYVE(SARA) was co-expressed with YFP-Fv-FYVE(Hrs), or YFP-FYVE(SARA) was co-expressed with CFP-Fv-FYVE(Hrs), and cells were incubated with AP20187. This procedure resulted in the concentration of CFP and YFP on the same endosomal surface but through different FYVE domains. No unquenching of CFP fluorescence was detected with any of these combinations, indicating that non-cognate CFP and YFP FYVE domains do not elicit FRET despite their colocalization on the endosomal surface. Thus, the FRET detected when co-expressing CFP- and YFP-FYVESARA most likely reflects the presence of spontaneously assembled SARA FYVE domain dimers. To determine the stability of the oligomeric species formed by the SARA FYVE domain, histidine-tagged EEA1 and SARA FYVE domains were produced in Escherichia coli and subjected to size exclusion chromatography. Much of the SARA construct eluted as a higher order oligomer in the void volume of the column, but a distinct peak corresponding to a dimer was detected (Fig. 6). When this peak was reapplied to the column, it quantitatively eluted at the position of the dimer. In contrast, the EEA1-FYVE domain eluted as a monomer, revealing an inherent capability of the FYVE domain of SARA to form stable dimers. This property could explain the exceptional capacity of the FYVE domain of SARA to interact with the endosomal surface and may underlie the ability of full-length SARA to oligomerize (33Jayaraman L. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40710-40717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Effect of Dimerization of Isolated FYVE Domains on Their Endosomal Localization—To determine whether the differing ability of other FYVE domains to interact with the endosomal surface resides exclusively in their ability to oligomerize, the Fv extrinsic dimerization moiety was added to additional FYVE domains. Surprisingly, only the FYVE domain of frabin displayed a behavior similar to that of Hrs in response to AP20187 (Fig. 7). The FYVE domain of a close homologue of frabin (FGD1) and that of EEA1 failed to bind to endosomal membranes in response to AP20187-induced dimerization. Although the failure of the FGD1-FYVE domain to bind could be attributed to the presence of a proline in place of the conserved tryptophan of the conserved WXXD motif (Fig. 1A), the failure of the EEA1-FYVE domain to bind cannot be explained by the lack of any of the conserved residues that directly contact the PI(3)P head group. In fact, the conserved WXXD, RRHHCR, and RVC motifs are identical between the EEA1 and SARA FYVE domains. To determine the structural features that distinguish the FYVE domains of SARA and EEA1, we constructed a series of chimeras. Sequences directly N-terminal to the RRHHCR motif (the turret loop), and sequences that in the crystal structure of EEA1 form the dimer interface region, were exchanged. The subcellular localization of chimeras containing diverse combinations of 4 amino acids of the turret loops (TL) and 6 amino acids of the dimer interface loops (DI) of EEA1 and SARA is shown in Fig. 8. As shown previously, eGFP-Fv-FYVE(EEA1) displayed a cytosolic distribution both in the absence and in the presence of dimerizer (Fig. 8A, TLeDIe). However, when 4 amino acids in the turret loop of EEA1 were replaced by those of SARA, strong binding to endosomes was observed in response to dimerizer (Fig. 8A, TLs/DIe). Furthermore, replacement of the corresponding amino acids in eGFP-Fv-FYVE(SARA) with those of EEA1 caused the protein to shift (Fig. 8B, TLs/DIs) to a cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 8B, TLe/DIs). These results suggest that the turret loop of SARA contributes significantly to the membrane partitioning of the SARA FYVE domain. Replacement of 6 amino acids in the dimer interface of EEA1 with the corresponding region of SARA also resulted in significant endosomal binding in response to dimerization (Fig. 8A, TLe/DIs). When both the turret loop and the dimer interface region of the FYVE domain of EEA1 were replaced with those of SARA, the resulting construct displayed detectable endosome binding even in the absence of dimerizer and very strong binding in its presence (Fig. 8A, Tls/DIs), resembling the behavior of the FYVE domain of SARA (Fig. 8B, Tls/DIs). Thus, the extreme difference in th"
https://openalex.org/W1989880445,"The TAZ1 domain of the homologous transcriptional coactivators CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 forms a complex with CITED2 (CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail), inhibiting the activity of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α) and thereby attenuating the cellular response to low tissue oxygen concentration. We report the NMR structure of the CBP TAZ1 domain bound to the activation domain of CIT-ED2. The structure of TAZ1, consisting of four α-helices (α1-α4) stabilized by three zinc atoms, is very similar in the CITED2 and HIF-1α complexes. The activation domain of CITED2 is unstructured when free and folds upon binding, forming a helix (termed αA) and an extended structure that wraps around TAZ1. The CITED2 αA helix packs in the TAZ1 α1/α4 interface, a site that forms weak interactions with the poorly defined aminoterminal α-helix of HIF-1α. CITED2 and HIF-1α both contain a four residue motif, LP(E/Q)L, which binds in the TAZ1 α1/α2/α3 junction in each complex. The carboxyl-terminal region of CITED2 forms an extended structure with hydrophobic contacts in the TAZ1 α1/α3 interface in the site occupied by the HIF-1α αB helix. CITED2 does not bind at all to the TAZ1 site occupied by the HIF-1α carboxyl-terminal helix. The HIF-1α and CITED2 domains utilize partly overlapping surfaces of TAZ1 to achieve high affinity binding and to compete effectively with each other for interaction with CBP/p300; CITED2 and HIF-1α use these binding sites differently to maintain similar binding affinities in order to displace each other in a feedback loop during the hypoxic response.

The cellular response to hypoxia in mammals involves a complex interplay of a number of transcriptional molecules. The primary response to hypoxia involves the heterodimeric transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), 1The abbreviations used are: HIF-1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CITED2, CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with ED-rich tail; CAD, carboxyl-terminal activation domain; TAZ1, transcription adaptor zinc-binding domain of CBP; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. a major factor in the pathology of cancer, heart disease, and stroke (1.Semenza G.L.

Under conditions of oxygen deprivation, the HIF-1α subunit recruits the general transcriptional coactivators CBP or p300 to direct the expression of genes necessary for survival (4.Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Deletion of HIF-1α in mice results in neural and cardiovascular developmental arrest and embryonic death (5.Iyer N.V. Kotch L.E. Agani F. Leung S.W. Laughner E. Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Gearhart J.D. Lawler A.M. Yu A.Y. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2050) Google Scholar). Consistent with the central role of the HIF-1 system in the maintenance of cellular oxygen homeostasis, a variety of mechanisms, including oxidative degradation and transcriptional inactivation, closely regulate the activity of HIF-1α. Under normoxic conditions, low HIF-1α protein levels are maintained by a family of specific prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1-3) that target HIF-1α for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. These hydroxylases modify two prolines within conserved LXXLAP motifs in HIF-1α to enhance interaction with the von Hippel-Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (6.Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M.

The transcriptional activity of HIF-1α is directly dependent on the interaction of its carboxyl-terminal activation domain (CAD) with the TAZ1 domain, also referred to as cysteine/histidine-rich domain 1 (C/H1), of CBP/p300 (4.Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 10.Kallio P.J.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar), a second class of oxygen dependent HIF-1α specific regulator, hydroxylates an asparagine residue within the HIF-1α CAD to attenuate the interaction with the coactivator CBP/p300 (12.Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Recent NMR structures from our laboratory and others highlight the exquisite specificity involved in the formation of the HIF-1α CAD·TAZ1 complex and the nature of the molecular interactions that define the hypoxic switch (13.Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 14.Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In the complex, the CBP TAZ1 domain is composed of four α-helices stabilized by three zinc atoms in a fashion similar to that of the isolated CBP TAZ2 domain (15.De Guzman R.N. Liu H.Y. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Upon binding to CBP, the HIF-1α CAD undergoes a folding transition to form three helices, namely a poorly defined aminoterminal helix (αA) that interacts weakly with TAZ1 and two tight-binding helices, αB and αC, all of which wrap around the TAZ1 domain in highly intimate fashion. The TAZ1 domain thus acts as a scaffold, providing extensive hydrophobic surface grooves to accommodate the transcription factor activation domain. Asn-803, the target of FIH-1, is deeply buried in a hydrophobic pocket in the CAD·TAZ1 complex and participates in an extended network of hydrogen bonds that stabilize the complex. In hypoxia, a third HIF-1α regulatory mechanism is proposed to be mediated by the protein CITED2 (CBP/p300 Interacting Transactivator with glutamate (E) and aspartate (D) rich tail, also termed MRG-1 and p35srj) (16.Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). CITED2 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that competes with HIF-1α for binding to the CBP/p300 TAZ1 domain. In mice, deletion of CITED2 results in embryonic lethality due to severe cardiac and neural tube defects (17.Yin Z. Haynie J. Yang X. Han B. Kiatchoosakun S. Restivo J. Yuan S. Prabhakar N.R. Herrup K. Conlon R.A. Hoit B.D. Watanabe M. Yang Y.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10488-10493Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). CITED2 knockouts also exhibit increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other hypoxia-responsive gene products. The severe phenotype of CITED2-/- mice is consistent with the additional function of CITED2 as coactivator for AP-2 transcription factors, which are necessary for neural development (18.Bamforth S.D. Braganca J. Eloranta J.J. Murdoch J.N. Marques F.I. Kranc K.R. Farza H. Henderson D.J. Hurst H.C. Bhattacharya S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 19.Braganca J. Eloranta J.J. Bamforth S.D. Ibbitt J.C. Hurst H.C. Bhattacharya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Expression of CITED2 is directly induced by HIF-1, implicating CITED2 as a negative feedback regulator of HIF-1α and a fundamental component of the cellular mechanism for attenuation of the hypoxic response. Previous domain mapping and mutagenesis experiments have defined the region of interaction with CBP/p300 TAZ1 to be the carboxyl-terminal activation domain of CITED2 (16.Bhattacharya S. Michels C.L. Leung M.K. Arany Z.P. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). As is typical of transcription factor activation domains, the CIT-ED2 CAD contains a relatively large number of residues with acidic and bulky hydrophobic side chains but has no obvious sequence homology with the HIF-1α CAD (Fig. 1). To determine the structural basis of HIF-1α inhibition by CITED2, we have determined the solution structure of the CBP TAZ1 domain bound to the activation domain of CITED2. The structure of TAZ1·CITED2 reveals the commonalities, as well as major differences, between the binding of CITED2 and HIF-1α to TAZ1. As this work was nearing completion, the solution structure of a homologous TAZ1 domain from the p300 coactivator, also bound to human CITED2, was reported (20.Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Kung A.L. France D.S. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Aside from the structural differences imposed by the sequence differences between the TAZ1 domains of CBP and p300, there are significant differences in the lengths of the domain constructs used in the two studies. The structures of the two complexes, TAZ1·HIF-1α and TAZ1·CITED2, together with NMR relaxation data that probe the backbone flexibility, suggest a mechanism of how CITED2 and HIF-1α displace one another from TAZ1. Protein Expression and Purification—A coexpression plasmid (21.Demarest S.J. Martinez-Yamout M. Chung J. Chen H. Xu W. Dyson H.J. Evans R.M. Wright P.E. Nature. 2002; 415: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) containing mouse CBP TAZ1 (residues 340-439) and human CITED2 (204-269, 220-269) was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (dnaY) and grown in 6-liter minimal medium containing 0.1 mm ZnCl2 and, for isotopic labeling, 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) and/or 13C-glucose (2 g/liter). Cells were grown at 37 °C, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an OD600 of ∼0.8, and left at 15 °C for over-night expression. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 150 ml of buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 μm ZnSO4, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 6 m urea) and sonicated, and the cell lysate (160 ml) was diluted to 4 m urea and loaded unto a 10-ml SP-Sepharose attached to a 10 ml Q-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences). TAZ1 was eluted from the SP-Sepharose column with a linear gradient of buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 μm ZnSO4, and 1 m NaCl, 4 m urea) and further purified through a C4 and then through a C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column. CITED2 was eluted from the Q-Sepharose column and further purified through C4 and a C18 reverse phase HPLC columns in a similar manner. TAZ1 and HIF-1α CAD were prepared as described previously (13.Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Final NMR buffer was 10 mm Tris-d11, 10% 2H2O, and 2 mm NaN3, pH 6.8. NMR Sample Preparation—The lyophilized CITED2 was dissolved in 10 mm deuterated Tris-d11, adjusted to pH 7, and dialyzed in the same NMR buffer as TAZ1. To prepare the complex, CITED2 and TAZ1 were combined in 20-30 μl increments to give a final volume of 600 μl and a final molar ratio of 1:1.3 of labeled to unlabeled partner. Upon mixing TAZ1 and CITED2, precipitates formed in the NMR tube. The effective complex concentration was then estimated by comparing the NMR signal to a known sample of free protein. NMR samples contained ∼400-500 μm complex. NMR samples in 100%2H2O were prepared by lyophilizing the dialyzed TAZ1 and CITED2 and re-dissolving the proteins in 2H2O before mixing to form the complexes. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were collected at 25 °C using an Aviv model 202 CD spectrometer and a 0.2 cm cell. Samples contained 7 μm protein in 3 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC data were collected at 25 °C by using a Microcal MCS Titration calorimeter. Purified protein samples were dialyzed into ITC buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, containing 50 mm NaCl and 2 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged to remove aggregates. Protein concentrations were measured by a standard bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Titration data were fitted to a one-site model by using the Microcal data analysis software ORIGIN 2.3 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) and were not adjusted for buffer effects. ITC data were acquired at least three times using different batches of samples on different days to obtain an error estimate for the Kd values reported in Table I.Table IDissociation constants for the binding of TAZ1 with different HIF-1α and CITED2 constructs obtained by isothermal titration calorimetryTAZ1 binding partnerKdnmCITED2 (residues 220–269)13 ± 10HIF-1α (residues 776–826)10 ± 5HIF-1α (residues 790–826)47 ± 11 Open table in a new tab NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on Bruker DRX600, DRX800, and AVANCE 900 MHz spectrometers, processed using NMRPipe (22.Delaglio F.

NMR. 1994; 4: 604-613Crossref Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). Resonance assignments for TAZ1 and CITED2 were obtained from heteronuclear (1H, 15N, 13C) and a multidimensional NMR experiment used previously in the TAZ1·HIF-1α complex (13.Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were obtained from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (τm, 120 ms) and three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (τm, 120 ms) acquired for samples in 100%2H2O and 10%2H2O. Intermolecular distance restraints were obtained from 13C-edited/12C-filtered NOESY-HSQC (τm, 120 ms). The [1H]-15N heteronuclear steady-state NOE experiment for 15N-labeled CITED2 bound to unlabeled TAZ1 was acquired with water flipback for water suppression (24.Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations and Analysis—Interproton upper bound distance restraints were derived from cross peak volumes in the NOESY experiments and were assigned upper bounds of 2.7, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 Å and lower bounds of 1.8 Å. Torsion angle restraints for φ, Ψ, and χ1 were obtained from the chemical shift index and intraresidue NOE connectivities (25.Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G.

Initial structural models were calculated using 883 intraresidue and 126 intermolecular distance restraints obtained by manual assignment and 195 torsion angle restraints. Additional distance restraints were generated with the program SANE (28.Duggan B.M. Legge G.B. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 19: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and added during the structure calculation. The total numbers of distance and torsion angle restraints used are detailed in Table I. An initial set of 400 simulated annealing structures was generated using DYANA (29.Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar), followed by variable target function minimization. The 100 DYANA structures with the lowest target function were further refined by restrained molecular dynamics in AMBER7 using the ff99 force field (30.Case, D. A., Pearlman, D. A., Caldwell, J. W., Cheatham, T. E., III, Wang, J., Ross, W. S., Simmerling, C. L., Darden, T. A., Merz, K. M., Stanton, R. V., Cheng, A. L., Vincent, J. J., Crowley, M., Tsui, V., Gohlke, H., Radmer, R. J., Duan, Y., Pitera, J., Massova, I., Seibel, G. L., Singh, U. C., Weiner, P. K., and Kollman, P. A. (2002) AMBER 7, University of California, San FranciscoGoogle Scholar). When the distance and dihedral angle violations dropped below 100 kcal/mol, refinement was performed using the generalized Born (GB) potential in AMBER7 to account for the effects of solvent (31.Tsui V. Case D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2489-2498Crossref Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Twenty structures with the lowest combined distance and angle violations were sorted by AMBER energy and selected for analysis. Backbone analysis was performed using PROCHECK (32.Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4427) Google Scholar), and graphics images were prepared using MOLMOL (33.Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar). The free CITED2 activation domain, residues 220-269, is unstructured in solution as indicated by the absence of secondary structural elements in the circular dichroism spectra (Fig. 2A) and the narrow range of amide proton chemical shifts in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled CITED2 (Fig. 2B). The CD spectrum of the complex (Fig. 2A) shows the formation of additional structure compared with the individual proteins, as indicated by a comparison of the spectrum of the complex with the sum of the spectra of the two components. Upon binding to TAZ1, there is increased dispersion of the CITED2 amide proton chemical shifts, indicating structure formation (Fig. 2B). A longer CITED2 construct, residues 204-269, binds to TAZ1 in a similar manner, as manifested by changes in the backbone amide peaks of 15N-labeled TAZ1 (data not shown), but has a tendency to precipitate upon complex formation. The shorter CITED2 construct (residues 220-269) showed high affinity to TAZ1 (Kd = 13 nm, Table I) with less tendency to precipitate upon binding to TAZ1 and was therefore used for structure determination. Binding is in slow exchange on the chemical shift time scale, as evidenced by the appearance of new CITED2 peaks in the bound form and the disappearance of free CITED2 peaks when 15N-labeled CIT-ED2 is added to unlabeled TAZ1. The changes in chemical shifts for the CITED2 protein upon binding indicate the formation of a helical structure in the N terminus, with an extended structure in the center of the sequence. This is in contrast to the observation for HIF-1α of the formation of helical structure in several locations throughout the sequence. Measurement of the heteronuclear [1H]-15N NOE for CITED2 in the complex (Fig. 3) shows that the carboxyl-terminal 10 residues are relatively mobile. As observed for the binding of HIF-1α to TAZ1 (13.Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), a number of significant shifts in HSQC cross-peak positions were observed when unlabeled CITED2 was added to 15N-labeled TAZ1. Chemical shift mapping (Fig. 4) indicated that different regions of TAZ1 are perturbed by HIF-1α and CITED2, suggesting that the complexed structures of the HIF-1α and CITED2 are likely to be different.Fig. 4Chemical shift mapping of 15N-labeled TAZ1 titrated with unlabeled HIF-1α (top) and CITED2 (bottom). Chemical shift changes were calculated as ΔδHN,N = ¼√((δHN/2)2 + (δN/5)2).

The two HIF-1α constructs were used for binding studies to correlate the measured affinities with structural results. The longer HIF-1α (residues 776-826) was used in the CBP complex (20.Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Kung A.L. France D.S. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and the shorter HIF-1α (residues 790-826) was used in the p300 complex (13.Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The structure of the CBP TAZ1·HIF-1α (residues 776-826) showed intermolecular interactions involving the amino-terminal extension of HIF-1α, which likely contribute to the tighter binding affinity of the longer HIF-1α (residues 776-826) compared with that of the shorter HIF-1α (residues 790-826). ITC results indicate that CITED2 binds to TAZ1 with comparable affinity to the longer HIF-1α construct, but it binds approximately four times more tightly than the shorter HIF-1α construct. Three-dimensional structures for the TAZ1·CITED2 complex were calculated using the program DYANA (29.Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

A superposition of the 20 lowest energy structures of the TAZ1·CITED2 complex is shown in Fig. 5A, and a single member of the ensemble is shown in Fig. 5B. As was observed in the HIF-1α complex and in free TAZ1, 2R. DeGuzman, J. Wojciak, M. Martinez-Yamout, H. J. Dyson, and P. E. Wright, unpublished data. TAZ1 adopts a compact fold containing predominantly helical secondary structure stabilized by three zinc atoms. Upon complex formation, the activation domain of CITED2 wraps around TAZ1, and its folded structure is maintained by numerous intermolecular hydrophobic contacts. The structure of CITED2 is defined primarily by its association with TAZ1, as indicated by the much higher number of intermolecular NOEs (299; Table II) compared with only 13 intramolecular long-range NOEs (i - j > 4) for CIT-ED2 in the complex.Table IIExperimental restraints and structural statisticsNMR restraintsTAZ1CITED2Total distance restraints1052648Intraresidue457343Sequential250151Medium range (2 ≤ i – j ≥ 4)210141Long range (i – j > 4)13513Intermolecular distance restraints299Total dihedral angle restraints8787φ7540ψ5821χ15026Ensemble statistics (20 structures)Violation analysisMaximum distance violation (Å)0.20Maximum dihedral angle violation5.8EnergiesMean restraint violation energy (kcal mol–1)17mean AMBER energy (kcal mol–1)–6402Root mean square deviation from the average structureTAZ1-(345–435), CITED2-(222–257)Backbone atoms (N,Cα,C′) (Å)0.70 ± 0.11All heavy atoms (Å)1.16 ± 0.26Ordered residues onlyBackbone atoms (N,Cα,C′) (Å)0.49 ± 0.11All heavy atoms (Å)0.85 ± 0.12Deviation from idealized geometryBond lengths (Å)0.011 ± 0.01Bond angles (Å)2.4 ± 0.1Ramachandran plotMost favorable regions %81.6Additionally allowed regions %17.5Generously allowed regions %0.9Disallowed regions %0 Open table in a new tab The structure of the TAZ1 domain in the complex with CIT-ED2 is very similar to that in the HIF-1α complex (13.Dames S.A.

Each of the zinc-binding sites contains one histidine and three cysteine residues distributed across the ends of two helices and joined by a flexible loop. The two helices that form each zinc-binding site are packed at an angle against each other. The four helices are then packed against each other via hydrophobic interactions to enclose a hydrophobic core in the center of the molecule. Intermolecular interactions at the end of TAZ1 α4 and CITED2 (between residues Ala-435 and Lys-438 of TAZ1 and Val-227 of CITED2) stabilize the end of α4, making it significantly longer than the α4 helix in the TAZ1·HIF-1α (5 residues) (13.Dames S.A.

In the present complex, α4 forms a regular α-helix from Cys-429 to Ala-435 (7 residues) that becomes the 310-helix from Ala-435 to Lys-438. The structured portion of CITED2 in the complex begins at Phe-222, forming an extended structure with hydrophobic contacts with TAZ1 α1 and α4 (Fig. 6A). The aromatic ring of Phe-222 binds in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the TAZ1 α1 residues Leu-361, His-364, and Lys-365, whereas Ile-223 fits in the hydrophobic interface formed by α1 (Leu-361 and Lys-365) and α4 (Leu-432). The polar side chains of the highly conserved Asp-224 and Glu-226 residues are directed away from the interface and are close to the Lys-365, Lys-437, and Arg-438 of TAZ1. A well defined helix, αA, from Glu-225 to Met-235, fits in a groove formed by the TAZ1 α1/α4 interface and is stabilized by an extensive network of intermolecular hydrophobic contacts (Fig. 6A). Highly conserved nonpolar residues on αA are in direct hydrophobic contact with TAZ1 α1 and α4. Val-227 interacts with α4 residues Ala-435, Ser-436, and Lys-438, whereas Leu-228 is in a hydrophobic pocket formed by α1 residues Val-358, Leu-361, His-362, and Lys-365 and α4 residue Leu-432. The hydrophobic side chain of Met-229 fits in a cleft formed by the aromatic ring of His-362 and the methyl groups of Leu-381. The invariant Leu-231 interacts with α1 (Val-358) and α4 (Pro-431, Leu-432, and Ala-435) residues. At the end of αA, Val-232 interacts mainly with Val-358 and Leu-381, Ile-233 interacts with Leu-381, and Met-235 interacts with α1 residues Lys-351, Gln-354, and Val-358. The polar residues Glu-225, Glu-226, Ser-230, and Glu-234 are all located on the solvent-exposed face of αA The axis"
https://openalex.org/W2052441056,"The human lutropin receptor (hLHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays an essential role in reproductive physiology. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether the hLHR self-associates. We show that high molecular weight complexes of the hLHR can be co-immunoprecipitated from 293 cells transfected with differentially tagged hLHRs. These complexes are detected only in extracts from cells that have been co-transfected and not in extracts combined from cells expressing only one form of tagged hLHR, confirming the in vivo self-association of the receptor. In transiently transfected cells, in which a small percentage of cells overexpress hLHR and most of the hLHR is located intracellularly in the ER, the self-associated hLHR is composed predominantly of immature hLHR. When cells were transiently co-transfected with wild-type hLHR and a misfolded mutant of the hLHR, a physical association of the ER-localized misfolded mutant with the immature hLHR was observed, resulting in a decreased cell surface expression of the wild-type receptor. In contrast, in stably transfected cells, where the majority of cells express receptor and there is much less intracellular accumulation of hLHR, the self-associated forms of the hLHR are composed predominantly of cell surface receptor. The abundance of cell surface hLHR dimers and oligomers, as detected on SDS gels, is increased further upon human choriogonadotropin treatment of the stably transfected cells. In addition to documenting the self-association of cell surface hLHR, our results underscore the importance of the cellular distribution of recombinant GPCR as it relates to the nature of the GPCR dimerization and oligomerization.

Although dimerization has long been recognized to be involved in the signal transduction of integral membrane receptors such as receptors for growth factors and cytokines (1Heldin C.H.

However, in recent years, biochemical, biophysical, and functional studies have increasingly suggested that GPCRs exist in cells as dimers or higher ordered oligomers (for reviews, see Refs. 2Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 3Bouvier M. Nat. Rev.

In addition to homodimers of a given GPCR, specific heterodimerization between distinct GPCRs has also been documented. That GPCR heterodimerization is of functional consequence is best documented by those instances where the pharmacological or trafficking properties of the heterodimer are distinct from the individual GPCRs (4Devi L.A.

The lutropin receptor (LHR) is a GPCR that plays an essential role in reproductive physiology in both males and females. It is a member of the rhodopsin-like or Group A family of GPCRs and couples primarily to Gs (see Ref. 7Ascoli M. Fanelli F. Segaloff D.L. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar for a recent review on the LHR). The LHR and structurally related follitropin receptor and thyrotropin receptor, collectively referred to as the glycoprotein hormone receptors, in turn form a subset of rhodopsin-like GPCRs characterized by a large N-terminal extracellular domain that is responsible for the high affinity binding of the respective glycoprotein hormone. Prior to the cloning of the LHR cDNA, studies examining the equilibrium sedimentation of detergent-solubilized LHR and radiation inactivation of LHRs on gonadal cells had indicated that the LHR might exist as dimers or oligomers (8Kusuda S. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3046-3049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Crine P. Aubry M. Potier M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1984; 438: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A more recent study using cells stably expressing recombinant rat LHR demonstrated fluorescent resonance energy transfer between derivatized hormone bound to LHR-expressing cells consistent with the self-association of cell surface LHR (10Roess D.A. Horvat R.D. Munnelly H. Barisas B.G. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4518-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the desensitized rat LHR exhibits an increase in fluorescent resonance energy transfer, suggestive of larger LHR complexes formed upon LHR desensitization (11Hunzicker-Dunn M. Barisas G. Song J. Roess D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42744-42749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Using a functional complementation approach, recent studies have also shown that the co-expression of an hLHR defective in hormone binding with an hLHR defective in signaling restores hormone-stimulated signaling (12Lee C.-W. Ji I. Ryu K.-S. Song Y.-S. Conn P.M. Ji H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15795-15800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Ji I. Lee C.W. Song Y.S. Conn P.M. Ji T.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), further suggesting that the cell surface LHR self-associates. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether self-associated complexes of the hLHR could be detected biochemically. By co-immunoprecipitation of differentially tagged hLHRs, we show that the hLHR does indeed self-associate. However, our data demonstrate a profound difference in the nature of the self-association of the hLHR depending upon whether cells express most of the receptor at the cell surface or if there is a significant accumulation of receptor in the ER. Hormones and Supplies—Highly purified hCG was purchased from the NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, National Hormone and Pituitary Program and Dr. A. F. Parlow. hCG was iodinated following the procedure described for the iodination of hCG (14Ascoli M. Puett D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cell culture medium was obtained from the Media and Cell Production Core of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center of the University of Iowa. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, and Corning plasticware was obtained from Fisher. Preparation and Characterization of Tagged Receptor Constructs—The wild-type hLHR cDNA was kindly provided by Ares Advanced Technology (Ares-Serono Group, Randolph, MA) and was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Using the PCR overlap extension method (15Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6812) Google Scholar, 16Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar), a FLAG or c-Myc epitope tag was inserted after the signal peptide such that the tag would be on the N terminus of the mature protein (referred to herein as FLAG-hLHR or Myc-hLHR). For confocal microscopy, the hLHR was tagged at the C terminus with enhanced green fluorescent protein by subcloning the coding sequence of the hLHR cDNA into pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech). This latter construct is referred to herein as GFP-hLHR. The entire coding region of each construct was sequenced to ensure the fidelity of the epitope tagged cDNA. Automated DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA Core of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center of the University of Iowa. Control experiments showed that the placement of c-Myc or FLAG epitope tags at the N terminus of the hLHR does not adversely affect the cell surface expression, ligand binding properties, or signaling properties of the receptor. Although the placement of Myc or FLAG tags at the C terminus decreases cell surface expression of the hLHR, the placement of the larger GFP sequence at the C terminus of the hLHR did not decrease cell surface expression of the hLHR, and it did not affect signaling as measured by hormone-stimulated cAMP production (data not shown). Cells and Transfections—HEK293 cells were maintained at 5% CO2 in a culture medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 mm Hepes, and 10% newborn calf serum. Cells for experiments were plated on gelatin-coated plasticware. Transfections were performed using the calcium precipitation method (17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar), using 4 μg of plasmid in 2.0 ml per 35-mm dish or 20 μg of plasmid in 10 ml per 100-mm dish. For transient transfections, cells were used for experiments 48 h after transfection. To establish cell lines stably expressing the hLHR, 293 cells were plated into 100-mm gelatin-coated dishes and transfected with either Myc-hLHR in pcDNA3.1(neo), FLAG-hLHR in pcDNA3.1(zeo), or both constructs. Cells were selected in medium containing 700 μg/ml G418 (for Myc-hLHR-transfected cells), 600 μg/ml zeocin (for FLAG-hLHR-transfected cells), or both G418 and zeocin (for co-transfected cells). Stable cell lines were maintained in the medium containing the same antibiotics as described above. Western Blotting of Detergent-solubilized Cell Extracts—HEK293 cells expressing tagged hLHRs were analyzed for receptor protein by Western blotting. Cells were washed, and detergent-solubilized cell extracts were prepared using lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA as protease inhibitors) containing 100 mm iodoacetate. The extract was incubated in an ice bath for 30 min with intermittent vortexing. The lysate was then cleared by centrifuging 15 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge at maximal speed. Protein concentrations in the supernatants were measured using the Bradford assay (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 53: 304-308Google Scholar). Samples were diluted 1:6 in a 6-fold concentrated Laemmli sample buffer containing reducing agents (12% (w/v) SDS, 40% glycerol, 109 mm EDTA, 1.5 m Tris/HCl, 98 mg/ml dithiothreitol, and 6% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol), incubated for 1 h at room temperature, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10; 1:500 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). The immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation of Differentially Tagged hLHRs—HEK293 cells were transiently or stably co-transfected with Myc-hLHR and FLAG-hLHR, and detergent-solubilized lysates were prepared as described above. One day prior to the experiment, 5 μl of rabbit polyclonal antibody against FLAG (catalog no. F-7425; Sigma) was conjugated to 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by rotating overnight at 4 °C. On the day of the experiment, the conjugated anti-FLAG resin was washed with lysis buffer and added to 10 mg of cell extract. After rotating for 90 min at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitate was eluted with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing reducing agents. Twenty-five microliters of each immunoprecipitate was resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described above. The membrane was probed with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10; 1:500 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). The immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Treatment of Solubilized Extracts with Glycosidases—Detergent-solubilized extracts were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with either no additions or with 300 milliunits/ml endoglycosidase H (Endo H) or 300 milliunits/ml neuraminidase (both enzymes were purchased from Roche Applied Science). Proteolysis of Intact Cells Expressing the hLHR—Proteolysis of the cell surface hLHR was performed as previously described (19Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were cooled on ice for 15 min, washed twice with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and then fresh Hanks' balanced salt solution was added. Protease XIV (Sigma) was added to give a final concentration of 250 μg/ml, and the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min. To terminate the reaction, Waymouth's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm pepstatin, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin) was added. The cells were then collected and used for cell surface binding assays (performing the assay in plastic tubes rather than culture dishes) or for the preparation of solubilized extracts. The cell surface binding of cells after treatment with protease was 4.4 ± 0.7% (mean ± S.E.) that of untreated cells (n = 3). Biotinylation of Intact Cells Expressing the hLHR—Cell surface proteins of 293 cells were biotinylated as described previously (20Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were washed four times with ice-cold calcium-free, magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, and then biotinylated during two consecutive 15-min incubations at room temperature with 0.5 mg/ml solutions of sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Vector Laboratories) in the same buffer. The cells were then incubated with cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 15 min to quench the reaction, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, twice with 150 mm NaCl containing 2 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and lysed on ice for 30 min with lysis buffer containing a Complete Protease Inhibitor tablet from Roche Applied Science used at the concentration suggested by the manufacturer. Solubilized extracts were then either immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 or purified on an immobilized avidin column (Pierce). For the immunoprecipitation protocol, 10 μl of anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was combined with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose, rotated overnight at 4 °C, and washed. Biotinylated cell extract (100 μg) was combined with a given batch of conjugated antibody and rotated at 4 °C for 90 min. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked overnight with blocking buffer, and probed with streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (0.1 μg/ml in blocking buffer; Vector Laboratories), and visualized with an ECL detection system. For the affinity purification protocol, 10 mg of biotinylated cell extracts were applied to 1 ml of immobilized avidin (Pierce). After the extract entered the column, the column was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then washed extensively with PBS until the absorbance at 280 nm reached the value of buffer only. Bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 2.8) and immediately neutralized after collection with 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.5. These fractions were concentrated using Centricon YM-30 columns (Millipore Corp.), resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blotted with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody as described above. 125I-hCG Binding to Intact Cells—The levels of cell surface hLHR were determined by 125I-hCG binding assays to intact cells. HEK293 cells were placed on ice and washed two times with cold Waymouth's MB752/1 medium modified to omit the sodium bicarbonate and to contain 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 1 mg/ml BSA. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same medium containing a saturating concentration of 125I-hCG (500 ng/ml final concentration) with or without an excess of unlabeled hCG (50 IU/ml final concentration). The cells were collected into plastic tubes on ice, centrifuged, and washed twice with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution modified to contain 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 1 mg/ml BSA. The cells were then pelleted and counted in a γ counter. Confocal Imaging of GFP-hLHR in Stably and Transiently Transfected Cells—The day prior to the experiment, 293 cells expressing GFP-hLHR were plated onto lysine-coated slides (Biocoat cellware from Falcon). All reagents and incubations for the immunohistochemistry were at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with filtered 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4 (PBS-IH) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS-IH for 30 min. Cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS-IH for 4 min. After incubating with blocking solution (5% BSA in PBS-IH) for 1 h, the cells were incubated with monoclonal antibody to protein-disulfide isomerase (catalog no. MA3-018; Affinity Bioreagents) diluted 1:75 in PBS-IH containing 1 mg/ml BSA (PBS-IH/BSA). After washing with PBS-IH, cells were incubated for 1 h with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted 1:500 in PBS-IH/BSA. Cells were washed with PBS-IH and allowed to dry, and then Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and a coverslip were placed on top. Images were collected with a Bio-Rad 1024 laser confocal microscope. Co-localization of Differentially Tagged hLHRs—Cells transiently or stably co-transfected with Myc-hLHR and FLAG-hLHR were plated on coverslips, fixed, and permeabilized as described above. After blocking, the cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (catalog no. F3165; Sigma) and rabbit anti-Myc antibody (catalog no. sc-789; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:200 and 1:100, respectively, in PBS-IH/BSA. After washing, they were incubated for 1 h with Cy™5-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (catalog no. 515-175-062; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:500 and 1:1000, respectively, in PBS-IH/BSA. Control experiments (not shown) confirmed that there was no cross-reactivity of the anti-rabbit secondary antibody with the monoclonal primary antibody or cross-reactivity of the anti-mouse secondary antibody with the rabbit primary antibody. The cells were examined by confocal microscopy as described above. Self-association of the hLHR in Transiently Transfected Cells—To facilitate the study of potential hLHR self-association, constructs were made in which a FLAG or Myc epitope was placed at the amino terminus of the mature protein. Our own studies (data not shown) and those of others (19Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that the placement of these relatively small epitope tags at the amino terminus of the hLHR does not adversely affect receptor cell surface expression or ligand binding and signaling properties. Experiments were initially performed with 293 cells that were transiently transfected with one or both constructs. Western blots of extracts of cells that had been transiently transfected with Myc-hLHR display four prominent bands (Fig. 1). The 67- and 84-kDa bands have previously been shown to represent immature precursor and mature cell surface forms of the hLHR, respectively (19Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21VuHai-LuuThi M.T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5921-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based upon the predicted size of the protein translated from the cDNA and the resulting molecular masses calculated from SDS gels, it can be concluded that the 67-kDa immature and 84-kDa mature forms of the receptor represent monomeric forms of the protein. In addition, however, two additional higher molecular mass bands of 166 and ∼240 kDa are also observed on Western blots. These higher molecular weight complexes may represent self-associated hLHR and/or hLHR complexed with other protein(s). The complexes are not disulfide-bonded, since they are observed in the presence of reducing agents. However, the noncovalent interactions between the proteins in the complexes are strong enough to withstand the effects of SDS. To determine whether the high molecular weight complexes observed on SDS gels represent self-associated forms of the hLHR, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments on cells transiently co-transfected with Myc-hLHR and FLAG-hLHR. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, cells were transfected, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG, the immunoprecipitates were resolved on a reducing gel, and the gel was immunoblotted with anti-Myc. In this and all subsequent experiments, iodoacetate was included in the lysis buffer to prevent the artifactual reduction and reoxidation of disulfide bonds that can occur during solubilization of the LHR (25Sojar H.T. Bahl O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2552-2559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, Myc-hLHR and FLAG-hLHR can be co-immunoprecipitated with each other as 166- and ∼240-kDa complexes. These data clearly demonstrate that the high molecular weight complexes of hLHR detected on Western blots of cell lysates from hLHR-expressing cells result from the physical self-association of the hLHR. As with other self-associated GPCRs, a definitive assessment of the stoichiometry of receptor molecules in each complex is lacking. However, based on the sizes of the complexes and by analogy with other GPCRs shown to self-associate, we designate the 166-kDa complex as a dimer and the ∼240-kDa complex as an oligomer of the hLHR. Most of the hLHR Dimers and Oligomers in Transiently Transfected Cells Are Composed of Immature Receptor—To determine whether the high molecular weight complexes of hLHR in transiently transfected cells were composed of immature and/or mature receptor, we utilized several different experimental approaches. In one, we examined the sensitivity of the complexes to endoglycosidases (Fig. 3). Lysates from 293 cells transiently transfected with Myc-hLHR were subjected to treatment with Endo H, which cleaves high mannose-containing immature N-linked carbohydrates from proteins, or neuraminidase, which cleaves sialic acids from mature glycoproteins. It has previously been shown that the 67-kDa monomeric form of the hLHR is sensitive to Endo H, but not neuraminidase, consistent with it being a precursor form of the receptor in the ER, whereas the 84-kDa form of the hLHR has been shown to be sensitive to neuraminidase, but not Endo H, indicative of it containing fully processed carbohydrates and thus having exited the Golgi (21VuHai-LuuThi M.T. Misrahi M. Houllier A. Jolivet A. Milgrom E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8377-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Hipkin R.W. Sanchez-Yague J. Ascoli M. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5921-5926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 3 confirm these earlier studies and further show that neither high molecular weight complex exhibits any sensitivity to neuraminidase, whereas both exhibit a partial sensitivity to Endo H treatment. That the high molecular weight complexes are only partially sensitive to Endo H may be due to steric hindrance of the N-linked carbohydrates in the complexes to endoglycosidases. This is supported by the observation that the smaller 166-kDa complex shows more degradation upon Endo H treatment than the ∼240-kDa complex. We also examined the susceptibility of the different species of hLHR to be degraded by limited proteolysis of intact cells (19Fabritz J. Ryan S. Ascoli M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells transiently transfected with Myc-hLHR were subjected to protease treatment (under conditions where parallel binding experiments confirmed that 95% of the cell surface binding activity was lost), the lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western blots were probed with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 4A). As would be expected, protease treatment caused the selective loss of the 84-kDa monomeric form of the mature hLHR on the cell surface but had no effect on the 67-kDa immature, monomeric hLHR. These results also show that protease treatment of the intact cells did not diminish the abundance of either the 166- or ∼240-kDa complex. To further assess the cellular localization of the hLHR oligomers in transiently transfected cells, we determined if either high molecular weight hLHR complex could be detected in cells transiently transfected with Myc-hLHR and biotinylated to label cell surface proteins. Biotinylated proteins in the lysate were purified on a streptavidin column, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, only the mature, monomeric 84-kDa form of the hLHR was detected as a biotinylated species. As would be expected, the 67-kDa immature, precursor form of the receptor was not observed to be biotinylated. The lack of detection of either the 166- or ∼240-kDa forms of the hLHR under these conditions suggests that these complexes are not at the cell surface or are otherwise inaccessible to biotinylation. Taken altogether, the data in Figs. 3 and 4 are consistent with the conclusion that the 166- and ∼240-kDa complexes in transiently transfected cells represent complexes composed primarily of self-associated immature forms of the hLHR that are located intracellularly, most likely in the ER. If so, the abundance of hLHR dimers and oligomers in transiently transfected cells should not increase upon hCG treatment of the cells. As shown in Fig. 5, hCG does not affect the amounts of hLHR dimers and oligomers in transiently transfected ce"

Platelet-derived FV/Va, purified from Triton X-100 platelet lysates was composed of a mixture of polypeptides ranging from ∼40 to 330 kDa, mimicking those visualized by Western blotting of platelet lysates and releasates with anti-FV antibodies. The purified, platelet-derived protein expressed significant cofactor activity such that thrombin activation led to only a 2–3-fold increase in cofactor activity yet expression of a specific activity identical to that of purified, plasma-derived FVa.

Purified, platelet-derived FVa was 2–3-fold more resistant to activated protein C-catalyzed inactivation than purified plasma-derived FVa on the thrombin-activated platelet surface. The heavy chain subunit of purified, platelet-derived FVa contained only a fraction (∼10–15%) of the intrinsic phosphoserine present in the plasma-derived FVa heavy chain and was resistant to phosphorylation at Ser692 catalyzed by either casein kinase II or thrombin-activated platelets. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analyses of tryptic digests of platelet-derived FV peptides detected an intact heavy chain uniquely modified on Thr402 with an N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine, whereas Ser692 remained unmodified. N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-TOF analyses of platelet-derived FV/Va peptides identified the presence of a full-length heavy chain subunit, as well as a light chain subunit formed by cleavage at Tyr1543 rather than Arg1545 accounting for the intrinsic levels of cofactor activity exhibited by native platelet-derived FVa. These collective data are the first to demonstrate physical differences between the two FV cofactor pools and support the hypothesis that, subsequent to its endocytosis by megakaryocytes, FV is modified to yield a platelet-derived cofactor distinct from its plasma counterpart.

Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Bloom A.L. Forbes C.D. Thomas D.P. Tuddenham E.G.D. Haemostasis and Thrombosis. Churchill Livingstone, New York1994Google Scholar). In normal hemostasis, FVa functions as a non-enzymatic cofactor of the prothrombinase complex, which consists of a 1:1 stoichiometric and Ca2+-dependent complex of the serine protease factor Xa and FVa, bound to the membrane of appropriately activated platelets, and catalyzes the proteolytic conversion of prothrombin to thrombin (2.Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When incorporated into the prothrombinase complex, the catalytic activity of factor Xa is increased by approximately 5 orders of magnitude, and FVa contributes substantially to this increase (3.Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of FVa from the prothrombinase complex results in a 10,000-fold decrease in the rate of thrombin generation (3.Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the physiologic effect of which is demonstrated in the bleeding diatheses expressed by FV-deficient individuals (4.Tracy P.B.

Blood. 1985; 65: 810-818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Factor V circulates in two pools in whole blood. The majority (75–80%) is found in the plasma as an inactive, single chain procofactor of 330 kDa, whereas the remainder (20–25%) is found in the α-granules of platelets (9.Tracy P.B. Eide L.L. Bowie E.J. Mann K.G. Blood. 1982; 60: 59-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it is stored in a partially cleaved and activated state (9.Tracy P.B. Eide L.L. Bowie E.J. Mann K.G. Blood. 1982; 60: 59-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Osterud B. Rapaport S.I. Lavine K.K. Blood. 1977; 49: 819-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unique activation state of platelet-derived FV/Va and its proximity to the procoagulant surface of platelets make it an excellent source of cofactor activity for assembly and function of the prothrombinase complex at a site of vascular injury. Its paramount importance in the maintenance of normal hemostasis, when compared with that of plasma-derived FVa, has been demonstrated in several clinical studies. Individuals expressing substantially decreased levels of FV in their platelets exhibit a life-threatening bleeding diathesis despite their expression of relatively normal levels of plasma-derived FV (4.Tracy P.B. Giles A.R. Mann K.G. Eide L.L. Hoogendoorn H. Rivard G.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1984; 74: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). An individual with an antibody that neutralized greater than 99% of the plasma-derived FV pool endured surgical challenge as the antibody was without effect on platelet-derived FV/Va, indicating that the platelet stores of FV/Va were sufficient to maintain normal hemostasis (11.Nesheim M.E. Nichols W.L. Cole T.L. Houston J.G. Schenk R.B. Mann K.G. Bowie E.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 77: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This latter observation is consistent with the ability of platelet transfusions to correct bleeding episodes in individuals who have expressed acquired FV inhibitors for several months (5.Chediak J. Ashenhurst J.B. Garlick I. Desser R.K. Blood. 1980; 56: 835-841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though platelet-derived FV originates from the plasma pool of FV (12.Camire R.M. Pollak E.S. Kaushansky K. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 92: 3035-3041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Gould W.R. Simioni P. Kalafatis M. Luni S. Tracy P.B.

Blood. 2001; 98 (Abstr. 2157): 516Google Scholar), several studies have demonstrated distinct differences in the physical nature and proteolytic susceptibility of platelet- and plasma-derived forms of FV. Previous studies (16.Viskup R.W. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Blood. 1987; 69: 1188-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Monkovic D.D. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17132-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that platelet-derived FV/Va is composed of several peptides, some of which are distinct and have molecular weights unlike any intermediate species observed during the activation of the plasma-derived molecule. Whereas plasma-derived FV exists as a single chain procofactor expressing little if any cofactor activity (3.Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the platelet-derived FV/Va molecule, which is stored in the α-granule, has undergone partial proteolysis and expresses substantial cofactor activity upon platelet secretion (17.Monkovic D.D. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17132-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Vicic W.J. Lages B. Weiss H.J. Blood. 1980; 56: 448-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Kane W.H. Mruk J.S. Majerus P.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1982; 70: 1092-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, platelet-derived FV/Va is a unique substrate for several proteases when compared with its plasma counterpart. Kinetic analyses have demonstrated that plasma-derived FV is the preferred substrate for thrombin, whereas platelet-derived FV/Va is activated by factor Xa 50–100 times more effectively than by thrombin (17.Monkovic D.D. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17132-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin-catalyzed cleavage of platelet-derived FVa bound to activated platelets results in a 4-fold increase in cofactor activity that is sustained for as long as 4 h, whereas plasmin-catalyzed cleavage of plasma-derived FVa bound to activated platelets results in a rapid loss of cofactor activity (20.Conlon S.J. Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Tracy P.B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77 (Abstr. 2507): 616Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). An intriguing observation was made in work published by Rand et al. (21.Rand M.D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Blood. 1994; 83: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the heavy chain of platelet-derived FV/Va is totally resistant to phosphorylation by a platelet-associated kinase, under circumstances where the plasma-derived molecule is readily phosphorylated. Finally, several studies have demonstrated that platelet-derived FVa is more resistant to activated protein C (APC)-catalyzed inactivation when compared with plasma-derived FVa (22.Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Cushman M. Tracy R.P. Mann K.G. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20794-20800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23.Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Simioni P. Girolami A. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2818-2829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent insensitivity to APC results from a reduced rate of cleavage at Arg506 and is preferentially displayed when platelet-derived FVa is associated with the activated platelet membrane (22.Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Cushman M. Tracy R.P. Mann K.G. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20794-20800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, platelet-derived FV/Va appears to be a unique cofactor when compared with its plasma counterpart. All of the studies detailed above were done with platelet-derived FV/Va present in platelet releasates prepared with a variety of agonists. To date, functional studies with purified, platelet-derived FV/Va have been precluded by an inability to isolate the platelet-derived cofactor pool in its native, functional state. Therefore, this work outlines for the first time a protocol to purify platelet-derived FV/Va in order to define its physical and functional characteristics allowing the discovery of molecular characteristics unique to platelet-derived FV/Va.

Mann K.G. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20794-20800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Platelets were centrifuged at 1,500 × g in 250-ml conical polypropylene tubes for 15 min at ambient temperature. The supernatant was decanted, and the platelets were resuspended in a total of 1 liter of modified Tyrode's buffer (MTB; 0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm dextrose and 5 μm PGE1, pH 7.35) with the addition of 5 units/ml heparin. Red blood cells and those platelets that were not readily resuspended were discarded, and the suspended platelets were centrifuged at 1,500 × g. Platelets were washed two additional times in MTB buffer, and the final platelet pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm CaCl2(TBS/Ca2+). The final platelet suspension was counted on a model Z1 Coulter Counter (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Isolation of Platelet-derived FV/Va—Platelet-derived FV/Va was isolated by a modification of the procedure for the purification of plasma-derived FV (30.Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Washed platelets were diluted to a final concentration 4 × 109 platelets/ml in TBS/Ca2+ containing 5 μm PGE1 yielding ∼250–350 ml of platelet suspension. Subsequently, the protease inhibitors benzamidine (10 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), leupeptin (0.5 mm), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 μg/ml) were added to prevent protein cleavage. Platelets were lysed with the addition of Triton X-100 (1% v/v) for 5 min at 25 °C with occasional mixing yielding ∼560 units of FV. The platelet lysate was then incubated at 0 °C for 90 min to generate a cryoprecipitate, which was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C with greater than 98% recovery of platelet-derived FV/Va. An anti-human FV monoclonal antibody (30.Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) coupled to Sepharose CL-4B resin (50 ml resin; 3–4 mg antibody/ml resin) was added to the supernatant, and the suspension was slowly stirred at 4 °C for 2 h to adsorb the FV onto the resin. The resin was then transferred to a sintered glass funnel, and the supernatant was removed by vacuum. The resin was then slurried with ambient temperature TBS/Ca2+ containing 1 mm benzamidine (TBS/Ca2+/Benz), transferred to a 2.5 × 20 cm chromatography column, and washed at ambient temperature with TBS/Ca2+/Benz until the corrected A280 (A280C) was below 0.01. This was followed by an identical wash with TBS/Ca2+/Benz containing 0.35 m NaCl until an A280C < 0.01 was reached in the flow through. The bound FV was subsequently eluted with TBS/Ca2+/Benz containing 5.0 m NaCl at a flow rate of ∼0.2 ml/min. Collected fractions (5 ml) were assayed for FV cofactor activity using a prothrombin time-based clotting system employing FV-deficient plasma. Fractions containing detectable FV cofactor activity were pooled and generally exhibited nearly 10% of the starting FV/Va present in the platelet lysate. Buffer exchange of the pool into TBS/Ca2+ was accomplished at 4 °C using an Amicon ultrafiltration cell with a YM30 filter that had been soaked for 30 min in TBS/Ca2+ containing 1% PEG-8000 to reduce FV binding. The pool was then concentrated down to a volume of ∼0.15 ml, followed by the addition of glycerol/CaCl2 (50%, 2 mm final, respectively), and stored at –20 °C. The concentration of platelet-derived FV/Va was determined by western blot quantitation of the light chain fragment by densitometry using the NIH Image software package. Additionally, these calculated concentrations were confirmed by comparison of the fully activated platelet-derived cofactor to a standard curve of plasma-derived FVa. Typically, the purified platelet-derived FV/Va exhibited a 4–8% yield and a specific cofactor activity of ∼120 units/mg with greater than 140-fold purification. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting of Purified Plasma- and Platelet-derived FV/Va—Purified platelet-derived FV/Va (0.5 μm) in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 (HBS/Ca2+), containing 0.1% PEG-8000 was treated with thrombin (20 nm) at 37 °C for 15 min to ensure full activation in the presence of residual glycerol (∼6%) from the FV storage buffer. Additionally, a sample of purified plasma-derived FV was identically thrombin-activated for 10 min, sufficient to ensure full activation. The activated FVa solution was then treated with hirudin (30 nm) to terminate the reaction. Protein samples (50 μl; 7 μg) were diluted with 12.5 μl of 312.5 mm Tris-HCl, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8 (5× SDS-sample preparation buffer), heated at 100 °C for 2 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–12% polyacrylamide gels by the method of Laemmli (33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Gels were either silver-stained by the method of Merril et al. (38.Merril C.R. Dunau M.L. Goldman D. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), or protein was transferred to nitrocellulose as described by Towbin et al. (39.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar) and analyzed by western blotting techniques using either mouse anti-human FV monoclonal antibodies αHFVaLC9 (26.Foster W.B. Tucker M.M. Katzmann J.A. Miller R.S. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Blood. 1983; 61: 1060-1067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), αHFVaHC17 (26.Foster W.B. Tucker M.M. Katzmann J.A. Miller R.S. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Blood. 1983; 61: 1060-1067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or a burro anti-human FV polyclonal antibody (9.Tracy P.B. Eide L.L. Bowie E.J. Mann K.G. Blood. 1982; 60: 59-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (12.Camire R.M. Pollak E.S. Kaushansky K. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 92: 3035-3041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional Characterization of Purified Platelet-derived FV/Va— Analyses of the kinetics of prothrombin activation were used to define the apparent KD value governing the interaction of platelet- or plasma-derived FVa with other constituents of the prothrombinase complex in an assay consisting of purified reagents. Reaction mixtures, containing PCPS (30 μm), factor Xa (15 pm), dansylarginine N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (3 μm), and varying concentrations of FVa (0–7 nm) in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% PEG-8000, pH 7.4) were incubated for 5 min followed by the addition of prothrombin (1.4 μm final). At selected timed intervals, aliquots were removed and diluted with 3 volumes of Quench buffer (20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG-8000, pH 7.4) to stop the reaction. The thrombin concentration in each sample was determined using the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme TH (0.2 mm, American Diagnostica, Inc., Greenwich, CT) by comparison to a thrombin standard curve (0–200 nm). The initial rate of thrombin generation in the various prothrombin activation mixtures was calculated by linear regression analysis of the data obtained from the subsamples removed over time. Binding constants were determined by non-linear regression analysis to equations described previously (40.Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11896-11906Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Analyses of Post-translational Modification of Platelet- and Plasma-derived FVa—For in-gel trypsin digestion and extraction of FVa peptides, FVa 105-kDa heavy chain and 74-kDa light chain bands were isolated by excision from a 5–15% gradient gel following SDS-PAGE (33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and digested with sequencing grade trypsin as described (42.Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Briefly, gel slices containing either FVa heavy chain or light chain peptides were minced into 1-mm3 pieces and washed three times with 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, for 15 min. The samples were dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile for 5 min and dried under vacuum by rotary evaporation for 25 min. A 75-μl solution of trypsin (0.01 μg/μl trypsin in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0) was added to the dried gel pieces, and digestion proceeded for 21.5 h at 37 °C. To elute the resulting FVa peptides from the gel pieces, the liquid phase was removed to a second siliconized Eppendorf tube and replaced with 50 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid followed by incubation at ambient temperature for 60 min. The resulting supernatant was removed, added to the sample collected previously, replaced with an additional equal volume of the same solution, and subsequently incubated with the gel pieces an additional 30 min. The supernatants were then pooled and dried under vacuum by rotary evaporation. Samples for MALDI-TOF analyses were prepared using a ZipTipC18 micro column as per the manufacturer's instructions and spotted on a 100-well stainless steel sample plate in 10 mg/ml α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectroscopic Analyses of Trypsin-digested FVa Peptides—MALDI-TOF spectra were obtained on a Voyager DE-Pro mass spectrometer (Perceptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser and a single-stage reflector. The spectra were obtained in positive-ion mode with delayed extraction. All spectra were calibrated using a mixture of angiotensin [M + H]+ = 1296.7 (monoisotopic), adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 1–18 [M + H]+ = 2093.1 (monoisotopic), and oxidized insulin B chain [M + H]+ = 3494.7 (monoisotopic). Experimentally obtained peptide masses were entered into the MS-FIT program of the University of California, San Francisco, Protein Prospector program (prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsf-html3.4/msfit.htm) for comparison to the known sequence of human FV. Post-translational modifications present on the peptides were identified by comparison of unmatching peak masses to all known eukaryotic post-translational modifications using the FindMod tool of the ExPASy system (www.expasy.ch/tools/findmod) from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Identification of N-linked glycoforms was obtained by input of unmatching peak masses into the GlycoMod Tool (www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/glycomod_form.html) of the same system.

Here, we used the partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2), measured in surface waters from 1979 through early 2001, to examine the effect on the equatorial Pacific CO2 chemistry of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase shift, which occurred around 1988 to 1992. During the decade before the shift, the surface water PCO2 (corrected for temperature changes and atmospheric CO2 uptake) in the central and western equatorial Pacific decreased at a mean rate of about -20 microatm per decade, whereas after the shift, it increased at about +15 microatm per decade. These changes altered the CO2 sink and source flux of the equatorial Pacific significantly."
https://openalex.org/W2014271076,"Among mammalian lipoxygenases the 15-lipoxygenase-1 is somewhat special because of its capability of oxygenating complex lipid-protein assemblies (biomembranes, lipoproteins) and previous investigations have implicated calcium in enzyme/membrane interaction. We investigated the mechanism of calcium-dependent membrane association and obtained the following results. (i) Membrane binding of 15-lipoxygenase-1 involves electrostatic forces as well as hydrophobic interactions of solvent-exposed apolar amino acids (Tyr15, Phe70, Leu71, Trp181, and Leu195) with the hydrophobic core of membrane phospholipids. These sequence determinants of membrane association are clustered at the membrane contact plane of the enzyme that also involves the entrance to the substrate binding pocket. Site-directed mutagenesis of these determinants to negatively charged residues strongly impaired membrane binding. (ii) Calcium at micromolar concentrations (5-50 μm) is required for efficient membrane binding. For direct 15-lipoxygenase/calcium interaction a dissociation constant of 2-5 × 10-4m was determined (low affinity binding) and we failed to detect high affinity calcium-binding sites at the enzyme. Reversible low affinity calcium binding induces subtle structural alterations of the enzyme, which did not impact catalytic activity. (iii) Increasing calcium concentrations failed to reverse impairment of membrane binding induced by mutagenesis of the sequence determinants indicating the priority of hydrophobic interactions. Taken together these data suggest that 15-lipoxygenase-1 associates to biomembranes primarily via hydrophobic interactions between surface-exposed apolar amino acid side chains and membrane lipids. Calcium supports membrane binding probably by forming salt bridges between the negatively charged head groups of membrane phospholipids and acidic surface amino acids of the membrane contact plane and this interaction might contribute to overcome repulsive forces.

Smith W.L. Prostaglandins & Other Lipid Mediators. Vols. 68-69. 2002: 211-323Google Scholar). In mammals, LOXs are categorized with respect to their positional specificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation (2Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Google Scholar), but plant physiologists prefer a linoleic acid-related enzyme nomenclature (3Feussner I. Wasternack C. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 275-297Google Scholar). Mammalian LOXs are involved in the biosynthesis of inflammatory mediators, such as leukotrienes (4Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Google Scholar) and lipoxins (5Aliberti J. Hieny S. Reis-e-Sousa C. Serhan C.N. Sher A. Nat.

Although LOXs are cytosolic enzymes they have a tendency of membrane association. For the soybean LOX-1 it has been reported that the enzyme binds to biomembranes via calcium-dependent mechanisms (12Tatulian S.A. Steczko J. Minor W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15481-15490Google Scholar). Structural modeling suggested the existence of two independent calcium-binding sites, one in the NH2-terminal β-barrel domain (Glu21, Glu106, and Glu179) the other one in the catalytic domain (Glu673, Asp674, and Glu677). Together with surface-exposed hydrophobic amino acids these calcium-binding sites have been implicated in membrane association of the enzyme. Although the role of calcium ions is still not completely understood they have been suggested to form salt bridges between acidic surface amino acids and negatively charged constituents of the membrane phospholipids (12Tatulian S.A. Steczko J. Minor W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15481-15490Google Scholar) Mammalian LOX isoforms, in particular the human 5-LOX, were also shown to interact with calcium. In vitro activity assays with the purified 5-LOX indicated that the catalytic activity measured in the presence of biomembranes or phospholipid liposomes was strongly augmented in the presence of calcium (13Rouzer C.A. Kargman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10980-10988Google Scholar). In various cells an increase in the cytosolic calcium concentration triggers translocation of the enzyme from the cytosol to the nuclear envelope (14Peters-Golden M. McNish R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 147-151Google Scholar, 15Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Google Scholar). There, the enzyme associates with the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) and the cytosolic phospholipase A2 that supplies free arachidonic acid by cleaving membrane phospholipids (16Kudo I. Murakami M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Med. 2002; Vols. 68-69: 3-58Google Scholar). Intracellular membrane binding assays with fusion protein constructs of the human 5-LOX and green fluorescence protein suggested that the NH2-terminal β-barrel domain of the enzyme appears to play a major role in Ca2+-dependent membrane association (17Chen X.S. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 811-818Google Scholar). The human 5-LOX binds calcium reversibly with a moderate affinity (Kd of about 6 μm) and stoichiometry calculations suggested the existence of two specific calcium-binding sites (18Hammarberg T. Radmark O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4441-4447Google Scholar). Structural modeling of the enzyme on the basis of the x-ray coordinates for the rabbit 15-LOX (19Gilmore S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 4: 1003-1009Google Scholar) suggested that the amino acids interconnecting various β-sheets of the NH2-terminal domain (Asn43, Asp44, and Glu46) may constitute potential calcium ligands (20Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Google Scholar). In fact, mutagenesis of these residues led to an impaired calcium affinity and to requirement for higher calcium concentrations to stimulate enzyme activity (20Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Google Scholar). However, as for the soybean enzyme selective calcium binding may not be the only process involved in membrane association. More detailed mechanistic investigations suggested an important role of solvent-exposed tryptophans (Trp13, Trp75, and Trp102) for binding of the human 5-LOX to phosphatidylcholine vesicles (21Kulkarny S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Google Scholar). The rabbit reticulocyte-type 15-LOX (15-LOX-1) also associates to biomembranes in a calcium-dependent manner (22Watson A. Dogherty F.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 377-383Google Scholar, 23Brinckmann R. Schnurr K. Heydeck D. Rosenbach T. Kolde G. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 91: 64-74Google Scholar). When the purified enzyme was incubated with submitochondrial membranes in the presence of 0.5 mm calcium the majority of the 15-LOX was recovered from the membrane pellet (23Brinckmann R. Schnurr K. Heydeck D. Rosenbach T. Kolde G. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 91: 64-74Google Scholar). This membrane binding is a necessary precondition for oxygenation of membrane lipids but it also activates the free fatty acid oxygenase activity of the enzyme (23Brinckmann R. Schnurr K. Heydeck D. Rosenbach T. Kolde G. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 91: 64-74Google Scholar). In resting cells the 15-LOX is localized in the cytosol but an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration induces binding to intracellular membranes (23Brinckmann R. Schnurr K. Heydeck D. Rosenbach T. Kolde G. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 91: 64-74Google Scholar). In contrast to the 5-LOX no preferential binding to the nuclear envelope was observed. Instead, the enzyme was primarily detected at the cytosolic side of intracellular membrane systems and at the internal phase of the plasma membrane (23Brinckmann R. Schnurr K. Heydeck D. Rosenbach T. Kolde G. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 91: 64-74Google Scholar). To shed light on the molecular basis of calcium-dependent membrane binding we recently explored the importance of selected surface-exposed amino acids and identified Phe70, Leu71, and Trp181 as primary determinants of membrane binding (24Walther M. Anton M. Wiedmann M. Fletterick R. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27360-27366Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic role of calcium and the contribution of other candidate amino acids remained unclear. To fill this gap we investigated calcium-dependent membrane association of the rabbit 15-LOX in reconstituted in vitro systems. The study was aimed at defining the structural basis of enzyme/membrane interaction and at exploring the mechanistic role of calcium in this process. Although we confirmed the importance of calcium for membrane association we failed to detect high affinity calcium-binding sites at the enzyme. However, mutagenesis data indicated that hydrophobic interactions of solvent-exposed apolar amino acid side chains with the hydrophobic core of membrane phospholipids are the major driving forces for the formation of 15-LOX-1 ·membrane complexes. Chemicals—The chemicals used were from the following sources: (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenoic acid (arachidonic acid), EDTA, imidazole, and sodium borohydride from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany); ampicillin from Invitrogen (Eggenstein, Germany); kanamycin, glycerol, dithiothreitol, trichloroacetic acid, calcium chloride (99.99%). and sucrose from Sigma; HPLC reference compounds ((5S,6E,8Z,11Z,14Z)-5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5S-HETE), (12S,5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12S-HETE), (15S,5Z,8Z,11Z,13E)-15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid (15S-HETE)) from Cayman Chemicals (distributed by Alexis GmbH, Grünberg, Germany); Tracepur® water (Ca2+ max 1 ppb) from Merck (Darmstadt Germany); HPLC solvents from Baker (Deventer, The Netherlands). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). Phage T4 ligase, PWO-polymerase, and sequencing kits were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Escherichia coli strain M15[prep4] was purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Oligonucleotide synthesis was carried out by TiB-Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). Preparation of the Native Rabbit 15-LOX—The rabbit 15-LOX was prepared (25Rapoport S.M. Schewe T. Wiesner R. Halangk W. Ludwig P. Janicke-Höhne M. Tannert C. Hiebsch C. Klatt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 96: 545-561Google Scholar) from a stroma-free supernatant of a reticulocyte-rich blood cell suspension by sequential fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (phenyl-5-PU column, Bio-Rad), and anion exchange chromatography (Resource-Q column, Amersham Biosciences). The final enzyme preparations showed a high degree of electrophoretic homogeneity (>95% pure) and their molecular turnover rate for linoleic acid varied between 5 and 15 s-1. Independent of its specific activity the LOX preparation exhibited a dual positional specificity with arachidonic acid as substrate (12-HPETE/15-HPETE ratio of 1/9) and converted linoleic acid exclusively to 13S-HPETE (less than 2% of other product isomers were detected). Bacterial Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Recombinant Enzyme Species—The recombinant wild-type 15-LOX and the various mutants were expressed in E. coli as His-tagged fusion proteins. For this purpose the 15-LOX cDNA was cloned into the pQE-9 expression plasmid (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) between the SalI and HindIII restriction sites. Bacteria were transformed with the recombinant plasmids and routinely, 3 liters of LB medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 25 mg/liter kanamycin were inoculated with a 15-ml overnight preculture. The bacteria were allowed to grow at 37 °C for 16 h and then expression of the recombinant protein was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration). The cultures were kept for an additional 2 h at 30 °C and then the bacteria were pelleted, washed (with phosphate-buffered saline), and resuspended in 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were disrupted with an Emulsiflex-C5 high pressure cell homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) and the cell debris was spun down. The clear lysis supernatant was applied to a 0.5-ml nickel-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed twice with washing buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazol, pH 8.0) and the adherent proteins were eluted by rinsing the column with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Five 0.25-ml fractions were collected and the LOX activity was assayed in each of them. Routinely, more than 90% of the activity was recovered in fractions 2-4. These fractions were pooled, diluted 1:50 with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (gel bed volume 500 μl; Amersham Biosciences) for further purification by anion exchange chromatography. After loading the column was washed twice with 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and then the enzyme was eluted with 120 mm KCl dissolved in the same buffer. Fractions of 0.250 ml were collected, activity was assayed, and the active fractions were pooled. For storage the enzyme preparation was supplemented with 10% glycerol and stored at -80 °C. For most mutants this procedure yielded about 2 mg of electrophoretically pure protein (Fig. S4, Supplemental Materials) starting from a 3-liter culture. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed point mutations were performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and the primary structures of mutated plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For each mutant, 5-10 clones were screened by restriction mapping and activity assays to identify catalytically active LOX-positive clones. For deletion of the NH2-terminal β-barrel domain a SalI restriction site was introduced in front of Cys115 by PCR. The PCR fragment was digested with SalI and KpnI, ligated into the pQE-9 expression plasmid containing the wild-type 15-LOX and E. coli (M15[prep4]) were transformed with this plasmid. This procedure led to a NH2-terminal truncation mutant that lacked the first 114 amino acids (β-barrel truncation mutant). Expression and purification of this truncation mutant was performed as described for the other mutants. Arachidonic Acid Oxygenase Activity—Arachidonic acid oxygenase activity of wild-type and mutant 15-LOX species was assayed by HPLC quantification of the oxygenation products. The assay mixture consisted of a 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm arachidonic acid as substrate (0.5 ml total assay volume). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold methanol, the hydroperoxides formed were reduced to the more stable hydroxy compounds with sodium borohydride, and the sample was acidified to pH 3 (acetic acid). After removing the precipitate by centrifugation aliquots of the clear supernatant were injected to reverse phase-HPLC for isolation and quantification of the reaction products. Membrane Binding Assay—In our standard membrane binding assay 200 μg of SMP were incubated at room temperature with 1 μg of recombinant 15-LOX (wild-type or mutant enzyme species) in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4 (total assay volume 25 μl). After a 5-min incubation period the samples were underlaid with a 0.1-ml sucrose cushion (500 mm sucrose in the same buffer) and centrifuged for 15 min at 100,000 × g in a Beckman tabletop centrifuge (4 °C). The pellet of this centrifugation step represented LOX-loaded SMPs. The supernatant was carefully removed, transferred to a separate tube, and ovalbumin was added to reach a final concentration of 60 μg/ml. The supernatant proteins were then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid reaching a final concentration of 10% and spun down by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant of the centrifugation step was discarded and the two pellets (100,000 × g pellet and 20,000 × g pellet) were reconstituted in 25 μl of 2-fold concentrated electrophoresis loading buffer (0.58 m sucrose, 280 mm Tris base, 211 mm Tris-HCl, 139 mm SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.44 mm Serva Blue G250, and 200 mm dithiothreitol). After heating to 95 °C for 5 min, aliquots (4 μl) were loaded onto SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis the proteins were blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane by a semi-dry blotting technique and the blots were probed with a mouse anti-RGS-His tag antibody (Qiagen). As secondary antibody a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma) was used. The blots were visualized by treating them with the Western lightning chemiluminescence plus reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The intensity of the immunoreactive bands was quantified densitometrically using the Phoretix 1D software package (Phoretix Intl., Newcastle, United Kingdom). HPLC Analysis—HPLC was performed on a Shimadzu system connected to an Agilent 1100 diode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Reverse phase-HPLC was carried out on a Nucleosil C-18 column (Macherey-Nagel, KS-system, 250 × 4 mm, 5-μm particle size) coupled with an appropriate guard column (30 × 4 mm, 5 μm particle size). For analysis of the hydroxylated fatty acids a solvent system of methanol/water/acetic acid (80/20/0.1, by volume) was used at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The chromatographic scale was calibrated for conjugated dienes by injecting known amounts of 15-HETE (5-point calibrations). The chromatograms were recorded at 235 nm (quantification of conjugated dienes). For enantiomer separation of 15-HETE chiral phase-HPLC was performed on a Chiralcel OD column (250 × 4 mm, 5 μm particle size; Diacel Chemical Industries Ltd.) with the solvent system n-hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid (100/5/0.1, by volume) and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Calcium Binding Studies in Solution—For determination of calcium concentrations all vials and pipettes were rinsed with 50% nitric acid and then washed extensively with Tracepure® water (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The 15-LOX preparation exhibiting a specific linoleic acid turnover number of 10 s-1 was desalted by passing it through a BioSpin-6 desalting column (Bio-Rad) and final protein concentration was determined. 0.1-ml aliquots of the desalted enzyme preparation were incubated for 10 min at room temperature at various calcium concentrations (100, 10, 3.3, 0.33, and 0.1 mm) and then desalted twice by passing them over the same desalting columns. Calcium concentrations of the samples were measured by electrothermal atomic absorption spectroscopy (see Supplemental Materials) on a PE 4100 ZL spectrometer (Überlingen, Germany). Numerical values were determined in quadruplicate and mean ± S.D. are given. Surface Plasmon Resonance Measurements (Biacore Experiments)—The Biosensor BIACORE X and the sensor chip CM5 (disposable sensor chip, the surface of which was covered with a thin gold layer coated with carboxymethyl-dextran residue for covalent protein immobilization) were purchased from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). The purified rabbit 15-LOX (native enzyme prepared from rabbit reticulocytes as well as recombinant wild-type and mutant enzyme species) was immobilized on the sensor chip (see Supplemental Materials). The coated sensor chip was placed in the Biacore flow chamber and pre-conditioned with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, using a flow rate of 5 μl/min until a constant baseline of light diffraction was observed. Then, calcium ions (1 mm CaCl2 in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4) were pumped over the 15-LOX-loaded sensor chip (5 μl/min) and light diffraction was monitored continuously. When the diffraction index has reached a new steady state calcium was removed by washing the sensor chip with calcium-free 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 (5 μl/min for 2-3 min), and removal of calcium was indicated by return of the light diffraction index to baseline levels. Next, the chip was rinsed with 1 mm EDTA to remove traces of calcium and then re-equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, to initiate a second round of calcium binding studies (descending Ca2+ concentrations). With this technology a single 15-LOX-coated sensor chip was sufficient to perform a series of binding studies covering Ca2+ concentrations between 8 μm and 1 mm. The light diffraction raw data were analyzed with the BIAevaluation 3.0 software package (steady state method). Miscellaneous Methods—Protein concentration was determined with the Roti-Quant detection system (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) that is based on the Bradford method. SMPs, which mainly constitute inside-out vesicles of the inner mitochondrial membrane, were prepared as described previously (26Crane F.L. Glenn J.L. Green D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 22: 475-481Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were carried out at room temperature on a Shimadzu RF5001 PC spectrofluorimeter (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) using 4-ml quartz cuvettes that contained 2 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. An excitation wavelength of 284 nm was selected and the emission spectrum was recorded between 300 and 400 nm. Structural modeling of the rabbit 15-LOX·arachidonic acid complex was carried out with the Hyperchem 5.0 software package. Amino acids, the coordinates of which have not been determined in the crystal structure, were modeled using Swiss-Pdb software followed by energy minimization of the side chains. Identification of Novel Sequence Determinants Involved in Membrane Binding—It has been reported before that the rabbit 15-LOX is capable of oxygenating biomembranes (27Schewe T. Halangk W. Hiebsch C. Rapoport S.M. FEBS Lett. 1975; 60: 149-152Google Scholar, 28Murray J.J. Brash A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 265: 514-523Google Scholar) and lipoproteins (29Belkner J. Wiesner R. Rathman J. Barnett J. Sigal E. Kühn H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 251-261Google Scholar) and that calcium ions are required for effective membrane oxygenation (23Brinckmann R. Schnurr K. Heydeck D. Rosenbach T. Kolde G. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 91: 64-74Google Scholar). More recently, two clusters of hydrophobic amino acids have been implicated in membrane binding (24Walther M. Anton M. Wiedmann M. Fletterick R. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27360-27366Google Scholar). However, there was evidence for the importance of other structural elements and the mechanistic role of calcium ions has not been investigated. Inspecting the surface of the rabbit 15-LOX we observed additional hydrophobic amino acids, the side chains of which are largely solvent-exposed (Fig. 1A). Rotating the three-dimensional model of the enzyme-substrate complex (Fig. S1, Supplemental Materials) we found that most of these residues are clustered on one side of the enzyme molecule. Interestingly, this part of the protein surface also contains the immediate entrance to the substrate-binding cleft. For this study we first performed membrane binding assays with the recombinant wild-type 15-LOX and single point mutants, in which the most prominently solvent-exposed hydrophobic amino acids were exchanged to negatively charged residues. From Fig. 2A it can be seen that the majority (some 80%) of the wild-type rabbit 15-LOX added to the membrane binding assay was recovered from the membrane fraction; only a minor share was found in the membrane-free supernatant. In contrast, the majority of the Y15E and L195E mutants was detected in the supernatant fraction. Similar results were obtained with W181E, F70H, and L71K (Fig. 2B), which have previously been implicated in membrane binding (19Gilmore S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 4: 1003-1009Google Scholar, 24Walther M. Anton M. Wiedmann M. Fletterick R. Kuhn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27360-27366Google Scholar). These data indicate that the hydrophobic surface amino acids Tyr15, Phe70-Leu71, Trp181, and Leu195 are involved in membrane association. In contrast, Tyr292 and Phe412, the side chains of which are solvent-exposed to a similar extent (Fig. 1), may not significantly contribute (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Membrane binding of wild-type and mutant 15-LOX species. The wild-type rabbit 15-LOX and the different point mutations were expressed as His tag fusion proteins, purified, and membrane binding assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No exogenous calcium was added to the assay system. A, Western blot analysis of supernatant and pellet fractions of the membrane binding assay carried out with selected 15-LOX single mutants. The mutants tested are indicated above the blots. B, quantification of membrane binding assays of wild-type 15-LOX, various single point mutants, and the NH2-terminal truncation mutant (catalytic domain), in which the β-barrel domain has been deleted. As measure for the membrane binding capacity the S/P ratios (quotient of unbound (supernatant) versus membrane bound (pellet) shares) were calculated (see panel A). Thus, large bars (W181E) indicate low membrane binding capacities, small bars (wild-type) strong membrane binding. C, membrane binding assay carried out with selected 15-LOX multiple mutants. The mutants tested are specified above the Western blots and the S/P ratios are indicated below. It should be pointed out that the membrane binding studies shown in this figure were carried out in the absence of exogenous calcium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further reduce the membrane binding capacity of the rabbit 15-LOX multiple mutants were created, in which the sequence determinants for membrane binding were mutated simultaneously. From Fig. 2C it can be seen that the triple mutant Y15E/F70H/L71K exhibited a strongly reduced membrane binding capacity. The double mutant W181E/L195E was almost completely recovered from the supernatant fraction indicating a low membrane binding capacity. Similar results were obtained for the quadruple mutant Y15E/F70H/L71K/L195E. It should be stressed at this point that all surface mutants created were enzymatically active although some of them exhibited a slightly reduced specific activity (Table I and Supplemental Materials). However, even those mutants retained their positional specificity, which is proof that catalysis proceeded entirely enzyme-controlled.Table IImpact of calcium ions on arachidonic acid oxygenase activity and positional specificity of 15-LOX speciesEnzyme speciesRelative arachidonic acid oxygenase activity15-HETE/12-"
https://openalex.org/W2072381529,"The ventricular isoform of human cardiac regulatory light chain (HCRLC) has been shown to be one of the sarcomeric proteins associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC), an autosomal dominant disease characterized by left ventricular and/or septal hypertrophy, myofibrillar disarray, and sudden cardiac death. Our recent studies have demonstrated that the properties of isolated HCRLC could be significantly altered by the FHC mutations and that their detrimental effects depend upon the specific position of the missense mutation. This report reveals that the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofibrillar ATPase activity and steady-state force development are also likely to change with the location of the specific FHC HCRLC mutation. The largest effect was seen for the two FHC mutations, N47K and R58Q, located directly in or near the single Ca2+-Mg2+ binding site of HCRLC, which demonstrated no Ca2+ binding compared with wild-type and other FHC mutants (A13T, F18L, E22K, P95A). These two mutants when reconstituted in porcine cardiac muscle preparations increased Ca2+ sensitivity of myofibrillar ATPase activity and force development. These results suggest the importance of the intact Ca2+ binding site of HCRLC in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction and imply its possible role in the regulatory light chain-linked pathogenesis of FHC.

Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Google Scholar) and the regulatory domain of scallop myosin, consisting of one RLC, one essential light chain (ELC), and a part of the myosin heavy chain (2Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Google Scholar), have revealed that the RLC is localized at the head-rod junction of the myosin heavy chain and, together with the ELC, stabilizes the α-helical neck of the myosin head. The N terminus of RLC is noncovalently bound to the myosin heavy chain between Asn-825 and Leu-842, whereas its C terminus wraps around the region located between Glu-808 and Val-826 of the myosin heavy chain (1Rayment I.

The N-terminal domain of the RLC contains a divalent cation-binding site, located in the first helix-loop-helix motif, which binds both Ca2+ and Mg2+ (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal region of RLC also contains the myosin light chain kinase-specific phosphorylation site (Ser-15), which is located in the proximity of the cation-binding site (3Szczesna D. Curr.

Depending on the affected gene and the site of the mutation, FHC has a variable presentation with regard to its degree, severity, and extent of myocardial disarray. The clinical manifestations of FHC range from benign to severe heart failure and to sudden cardiac death. The best characterized clinical cases include patients with β-myosin heavy chain mutations, who show a high level of cardiac hypertrophy, and those with troponin T mutations, who have less hypertrophy but a higher incidence of sudden cardiac death in young adults. To date 10 RLC FHC mutations have been identified, eight of which are single point mutations and two are intronic splice site mutations (Fig. 1B). The first three mutations, identified in an American population, A13T, E22K, and P95A, were shown to have a rare cardiac phenotype that involved massive hypertrophy of the cardiac papillary muscles and adjacent ventricular tissue causing a mid-cavity obstruction (4Poetter K. Jiang H. Hassanzadeh S. Master S.R. Chang A. Dalakas M.C. Rayment I. Sellers J.R. Fananapazir L. Epstein N.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 63-69Google Scholar). Two other RLC mutations, F18L and R58Q, identified in a French population (5Flavigny J. Richard P. Isnard R. Carrier L. Charron P. Bonne G. Forissier J.F. Desnos M. Dubourg O. Komajda M. Schwartz K. Hainque B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 208-214Google Scholar), were associated with a classic form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that causes increased left ventricular wall thickness and abnormal electrocardiogram findings with no mid-cavity obliteration. A new report by Richard et al. (16Richard P. Charron P. Carrier L. Ledeuil C. Cheav T. Pichereau C. Benaiche A. Isnard R. Dubourg O. Burban M. Gueffet J.-P. Millaire A. Desnos M. Schwartz K. Hainque B. Komajda M. for the EUROGENE Heart Failure Project Circulation. 2003; 107: 2227-2232Google Scholar) identified two additional mutations of French origin, D166L and a splice site mutation, intervening sequences 5-2 A → G of intron 5. Three subsequent RLC FHC mutations were found in the Danish cohort, N47K, K104E, and another splice site mutation, intervening sequences 6-1 G → C of intron 6 (6Andersen P.S. Havndrup O. Bundgaard H. Moolman-Smook J.C. Larsen L.A. Mogensen J. Brink P.A. Borglum A.D. Corfield V.A. Kjeldsen K. Vuust J. Christiansen M. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 38: E43Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A C → A transversion in exon 3 of the RLC gene, resulting in the N47K substitution (Fig. 1B), was identified in the 60-year-old proband of a Danish family (6Andersen P.S. Havndrup O. Bundgaard H. Moolman-Smook J.C. Larsen L.A. Mogensen J. Brink P.A. Borglum A.D. Corfield V.A. Kjeldsen K. Vuust J. Christiansen M. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 38: E43Google Scholar). The patient had severe septal and ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal electrocardiogram findings, and a high, relatively fixed mid-ventricular flow gradient, as well as diastolic filling abnormalities. The mid-ventricular flow gradient was caused not only by the pronounced septal hypertrophy but also by a significant increase in the size of the papillary muscle apparatus. Interestingly, a marked progression in the septal hypertrophy, from 31 to 45 mm, was seen over a 2-year span from age 60 to 62 years. The N47K mutation was not identified in the 150 healthy controls or in the other 197 probands. No other mutations in the additional seven FHC genes that were screened in parallel were identified in this patient (6Andersen P.S. Havndrup O. Bundgaard H. Moolman-Smook J.C. Larsen L.A. Mogensen J. Brink P.A. Borglum A.D. Corfield V.A. Kjeldsen K. Vuust J. Christiansen M. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 38: E43Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence analysis of cardiac RLC from different organisms reveals a high sequence homology among RLC from different species and demonstrates that the FHC-mutated residues of HCRLC are highly conserved in all of the presented RLC sequences (Fig. 2A). The structure of the N terminus of RLC is similar to other EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulin (CaM) or TnC (Fig. 2B), whereas the C terminus is considerably less similar (1Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequence comparison of HCRLC and other EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins reveals that amino acids of both Ca2+ binding site mutations, N47K and R58Q of HCRLC, appear as Lys and Gln in the equivalent positions of the CaM and TnC sequences (Fig. 2B). This study presents a physiological characterization of the FHC HCRLC mutants when reconstituted in porcine cardiac muscle preparations and also reports new solution data for the N47K-HCRLC mutation. We demonstrate that two Ca2+ binding site mutants, N47K and R58Q, in which the Ca2+ binding ability was lost due to the FHC mutation, increased Ca2+ sensitivity of myofibrillar ATPase activity and steady-state force. Our results suggest that the FHC-associated perturbations of the HCRLC Ca2+ binding site that lead to its inactivation and produce alterations in the Ca2+-dependent ATPase/force could be a key mechanism of the RLC-linked pathogenesis of FHC. We also propose the importance of the intact Ca2+ binding site of HCRLC in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction in the normal and diseased state of the heart. Mutation, Expression, and Purification of Wild-type HCRLC and the FHC Mutants—The cDNA for wild-type (WT) human cardiac RLC (HCRLC) was cloned by reverse transcription PCR using primers based on the published cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF020768) and standard methods (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 8.0.1-8.5.9Google Scholar). The FHC RLC mutants, A13T, F18L, E22K, N47K, R58Q, and P95A, were generated using overlapping sequential PCR (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 8.0.1-8.5.9Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant cDNAs were constructed with an NcoI site at the N-terminal ATG and a BamHI site following the stop codon, to facilitate ligation into the NcoI-BamHI cloning site of the pET-3d (Novagen) plasmid vector and transformation into DH5α cloning host bacteria for expression of the cDNAs of WT-HCRLC and the FHC mutants. The CDNAs of the proteins were transformed into BL21 expression host cells, and proteins were expressed in large (16 liters) cultures. Expressed proteins were purified as described previously (18Szczesna D. Ghosh D. Li Q. Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Arana C. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7086-7092Google Scholar). Flow Dialysis—Flow dialysis was performed in a solution of 100 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.0 (22 °C). All proteins were equilibrated in this buffer prior to the measurements. The flow dialysis experiments were performed according to Colowick and Womack (19Colowick S.P. Womack F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 774-777Google Scholar) with slight modifications described in detail previously (18Szczesna D. Ghosh D. Li Q. Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Arana C. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7086-7092Google Scholar). Data were calculated using Scatchard analysis (20Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Google Scholar) as described (18Szczesna D. Ghosh D. Li Q. Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Arana C. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7086-7092Google Scholar). CD Measurements—Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained using a 1-mm-path quartz cell in a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were recorded at 195-250 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm at a speed of 50 nm/min and a resolution of 0.2 nm. Analysis and processing of data were done using the Jasco system software (Windows standard analysis, version 1.20). Ten scans were averaged, base lines subtracted, and no numerical smoothing applied. Values of mean residue ellipticity ([θ]MRE, in degree·cm2/dmol) for the spectra were calculated (utilizing the same Jasco system software) using the following equation (21Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4108-4116Google Scholar, 22Holt J.C. Lowey S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4600-4609Google Scholar, 23Huang W. Wilson G.J. Brown L.J. Lam H. Hambly B.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 457-465Google Scholar),[θ]MRE=[θ]/(10·Cr·1)(Eq. 1) where [θ] is the measured ellipticity in millidegrees, Cr is the mean residue molar concentration, and l is the path length in cm. The optical activity of the buffer was subtracted from relevant protein spectra. The α-helical content for each protein was calculated using the standard equation for [θ] at 222 nm (24Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1285-1291Google Scholar),[θ]222=-30,300fH-2,340(Eq. 2) where fH is the fraction of α-helical content (fH × 100, expressed in %). The measurements were performed at 5 and 22 °C in 30 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm EGTA, 0.7 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4. Spectra were presented as mean residue ellipticity as shown previously (18Szczesna D. Ghosh D. Li Q. Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Arana C. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7086-7092Google Scholar). Depletion of Endogenous RLC from Porcine Cardiac Myofibrils (CMF) Followed by Reconstitution with CTnC and FHC HCRLC Mutants—CMF were prepared from the left ventricular walls and papillary muscles of porcine hearts from healthy young adult animals according to Solaro et al. (25Solaro R.J. Pang D.C. Briggs F.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 245: 259-262Google Scholar). They were stored at a concentration of about 20 mg/ml in SB buffer containing 30 mm imidazole, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7, and 50% glycerol at -20 °C. Before experiments were performed, CMF were removed from 50% glycerol stock, diluted with an equal volume of SB solution containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (SB1), and pelleted at 800 × g. They were re-suspended, tested for protein concentration (determined by a Coomassie protein assay), and diluted to 2.5 mg/ml in the same buffer. The RLC extraction was initiated with a wash of CMF with a solution containing 5 mm CDTA, 50 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.6 mm NaN3, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 5 min at room temperature. Then the CMF were pelleted, resuspended to 2.5 mg/ml, and incubated in the same solution for another 30 min at room temperature. They were washed three times with SB1 buffer, assayed for protein concentration, and diluted to 2.5 mg/ml. The RLC-depleted CMF were then reconstituted with a 40 μm solution of HCRLC-WT and/or FHC mutants and 8 μm porcine cardiac TnC (CTnC) (for which partial extraction could take place during the RLC depletion process) for 1.5 h at room temperature (Fig. 4). The HCRLC- and CTnC-reconstituted CMF were washed twice with SB1 buffer, assayed for protein concentration, and diluted to 2.5 mg/ml in SB1 buffer. 100-μl aliquots of CMF were then used for myofibrillar ATPase assays. Myofibrillar ATPase Assays—Myofibrillar ATPase activity assays of the control (not extracted), RLC-depleted, and HCRLC/CTnC-reconstituted CMF were performed in a solution of 30 mm imidazole, pH 7, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and different concentrations of Ca2+ from pCa 9 to 4.5. After a 5-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was initiated with 2.5 mm MgATP and terminated after 5 min with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Released inorganic phosphate was measured according to Fiske and Subbarow (26Fiske C. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Google Scholar). Skinned Cardiac Muscle Fibers—Freshly isolated porcine hearts were placed in oxygenated physiological salt solution of 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. The papillary muscles of the left ventricles were isolated, dissected into muscle bundles of about 20 × 3 mm, and chemically skinned in a 50% glycerol, 50% pCa 8 solution (10-8m [Ca2+], 1mm [Mg2+], 7mm EGTA, 5 mm [MgATP2+], 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 15 mm creatinine phosphate; ionic strength = 150 mm adjusted with potassium propionate) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 24 h at 4 °C. Then the fibers were transferred to the same solution without Triton X-100 and stored at -20 °C for about 2 months. CDTA Extraction of Cardiac Muscle Fibers—Endogenous RLC depletion from porcine cardiac muscle fiber preparations was achieved in the same solution utilized for CMF extraction, containing 5 mm CDTA, 40 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.6 mm NaN3, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.4. The fibers were incubated in this solution for 5 min at room temperature and then transferred to the fresh solution of the same composition for another 30 min. The extent of RLC extraction was tested by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6A). Depletion of the endogenous RLC may result in partial extraction of the endogenous TnC, and therefore, both of these proteins were added back into the CDTA-treated fibers (Fig. 6). Reconstitution of the CDTA-depleted Fibers with CTnC and FHC HCRLC Mutants—Reconstitution of the RLC-depleted fibers with porcine CTnC and HCRLC-WT or A13T, F18L, E22K, N47K, R58Q, and P95A mutants was performed in pCa 8 solution containing 40 μm HCRLC and 15 μm CTnC. The solution of CTnC was included in the reconstitution protein mixture during the first 30 min of fiber incubation followed by a 30-min incubation with fresh HCRLC solution at room temperature. The addition of CTnC was to assure that the fibers were not deficient in CTnC, because its partial extraction could affect the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development. Reconstituted fibers were then washed in pCa 8 solution and subjected to force measurements. The SDS-PAGE of the control, CDTA-depleted, and CTnC- and HCRLC-WT- or FHC mutant-reconstituted fibers is presented in Fig. 6. Steady-state Force Development—A bundle of 3-5 single fibers isolated from a batch of glycerinated fibers was attached by tweezer clips to a force transducer, placed in a 1-ml cuvette, and bathed in pCa 8 solution containing 1% Triton X-100. The fibers were then tested for steady-state force development in pCa 4 solution (composition is the same as pCa 8 buffer except [Ca2+] = 10-4m) and relaxed in the pCa 8 solution. Steady-state force development was monitored for control, CDTA-depleted, and then CTnC- and WT-, A13T-, F18L-, E22K-, N47K-, R58Q-, and P95A-reconstituted fibers. Ca2+ Dependence of Force Development—After the initial steady-state force was determined, the fibers were relaxed in the pCa 8 buffer and then exposed to solutions of increasing Ca2+ concentrations (from pCa 8 to 4). The maximal force was measured in each “pCa” solution followed by a short relaxation of the fibers in pCa 8 solution. Data were analyzed using the following equations,&percnt;forcerestored=100×(forcerestored-residualforce)/initialforce(Eq. 3) &percnt;changeinforce=100×[Ca2+]nH/([Ca2+]nH+[Ca502+]nH)(Eq. 4) where [Ca2+50] is the free Ca2+ concentration that produces 50% force and nH is the Hill coefficient. SDS Gel Electrophoresis—Control, CDTA-depleted and CTnC/WT-, A13T-, F18L-, E22K-, N47K-, R58Q-, and P95A-reconstituted porcine cardiac myofibrils and fibers were run on 15% SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) (Figs. 4 and 6). The respective HCRLC protein bands were quantified utilizing densitometry with the Scion Image for Windows (version beta 4.0.2). The percent of RLC depletion and/or reconstitution was calculated from the net intensity of the RLC bands compared with the control untreated fibers (100%). Differences in gel loading were corrected by comparing the RLC bands with the ELC bands (not affected by the RLC extraction/reconstitution procedure) of the respective fibers. Statistical Analysis—The significant difference between the pCa50 values of the Ca2+ sensitivity of myofibrillar ATPase activity and force development among WT and respective FHC HCRLC mutants was determined utilizing an unpaired Student's t test (Sigma Plot 8.0), with significance defined as p < 0.05. Effect of N47K Mutation in HCRLC on Ca2+ Binding and the CD Spectrum—We have recently published the Ca2+ binding properties and the CD spectra of human cardiac RLC and five recombinant FHC HCRLC mutants (A13T, F18L, E22K, R58Q,and P95A) (18Szczesna D. Ghosh D. Li Q. Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Arana C. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7086-7092Google Scholar). Three of the FHC mutations, A13T, F18L,and P95A, decreased the KCa ∼3-fold, whereas two other mutations, E22K and R58Q, changed the Ca2+ binding properties in a more drastic way. Compared with WT-HCRLC (KCa = 6.67 ± 0.21 × 105m-1), the E22K mutation decreased the KCa value by ∼17-fold, whereas the R58Q mutation eliminated Ca2+ binding to HCRLC (18Szczesna D. Ghosh D. Li Q. Gomes A.V. Guzman G. Arana C. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7086-7092Google Scholar) (Table I). Flow dialysis experiments utilizing 45Ca2+ performed for the new N47K mutant showed no Ca2+ binding to the single Ca2+-Mg2+ site of HCRLC (Table I). Therefore, the Asn → Lys substitution in the second from last coordinating position of the Ca2+ binding loop of HCRLC abolished its Ca2+ binding.Table IEffect of FHC mutations in the HCRLC on Ca2+ binding to isolated HCRLC (data from Ref.18Szczesna D.

(n is specified in Fig. 7) Open table in a new tab Far-UV CD spectroscopy was used to analyze whether the N47K mutation altered the secondary structure of HCRLC. As shown in Fig. 3, the mutation did not introduce any significant changes to the CD spectrum of HCRLC, and the calculated α-helical content (at wavelength 222 nm) of N47K was 18.7 versus 18.5%, determined for WT-HCRLC (n = 10). These values of α-helical content were calculated from the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm (at 22 °C), [θ]MRE ≈ -8020 or -7930 for N47K or HCRLC-WT, respectively. As demonstrated by others (23Huang W. Wilson G.J. Brown L.J. Lam H. Hambly B.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 457-465Google Scholar, 28Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3007-3014Google Scholar), they were similar to the values presented for rabbit skeletal RLC, although the percent of α-helical content calculated by these authors was shown to be higher (23Huang W. Wilson G.J. Brown L.J. Lam H. Hambly B.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 457-465Google Scholar, 28Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3007-3014Google Scholar). The effect of the N47K mutation on the CD spectrum of HCRLC was tested further at 5 °C. This was to assess the difference between these proteins at a low temperature-induced, possibly more folded, structure. Surprisingly, the CD spectra of these proteins did not significantly change, and their calculated α-helical content was about 19%. Interestingly, there was no change in the CD spectra of WT and N47K when monitored at 5 °C and then at 22 °C followed by the measurement at 5 °C. This suggests that the secondary structure of HCRLC is quite stable in this range of temperatures. Effect of FHC HCRLC Mutations on ATPase Activity in Reconstituted CMF—Extraction of endogenous RLC from porcine CMF was achieved with a 5-min wash followed by a 30-min incubation in the CDTA-containing solution (see “Materials and Methods”). Even though the CDTA solution contained 50 mm KCl to prevent extraction of TnC, the RLC- and possibly CTnC-depleted CMF were"
https://openalex.org/W1965219865,"Sulfate-reducing bacteria, like Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, have developed a set of reactions allowing them to survive in oxic environments and even to reduce molecular oxygen to water. D. vulgaris contains a cytoplasmic superoxide reductase (SOR) and a periplasmic superoxide dismutase (SOD) involved in the elimination of superoxide anions. To assign the function of SOD, the periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase activity was followed in both wild-type and sod deletant strains. This activity was lower in the strain lacking the SOD than in the wild-type when the cells were exposed to oxygen for a short time. The periplasmic SOD is thus involved in the protection of sensitive iron-sulfur-containing enzyme against superoxide-induced damages. Surprisingly, production of the periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase was higher in the cells exposed to oxygen than in those kept in anaerobic conditions. A similar increase in the amount of [Fe] hydrogenase was observed when an increase in the redox potential was induced by addition of chromate. Viability of the strain lacking the gene encoding [Fe] hydrogenase after exposure to oxygen for 1 h was lower than that of the wild-type. These data reveal for the first time that production of the periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase is up-regulated in response to an oxidative stress. A new function of the periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase in the protective mechanisms of D. vulgaris Hildenborough toward an oxidative stress is proposed.

Microbial sulfate reduction has been reported to be an ancient process as old as 3.47 gigayears. Sulfate reduction thus represents an early specific metabolic pathway, allowing time calibration of a deep node on the tree of life (1.Shen Y. Buick R. Canfield D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) 1The abbreviations used are: SRB, Sulfate-reducing bacteria; SOR, superoxide reductase; SOD, superoxide dismutase.1The abbreviations used are: SRB, Sulfate-reducing bacteria; SOR, superoxide reductase; SOD, superoxide dismutase. are universally distributed in marine and microbial mats where sulfate reduction is the dominant anaerobic biomineralization pathway. They constitute a group of anaerobic prokaryotes, which are unified by sharing the capacity to carry out dissimilatory sulfate reduction to sulfide as a major component of their bioenergetic processes. Although sulfate reduction is generally considered to be an anaerobic process, the abundance and metabolic activity of SRB in oxic zones is frequently evaluated as higher than those in neighboring anoxic zones in numerous biotopes (2.Canfield D.E. Des Marais D.J. Sciences. 1991; 273: 1471-1473Crossref Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 3.Krekeler D. Sigalevich P. Teske A. Cypionka H. Cohen Y. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 369-375Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In situ detection of sulfate reducing activity and SRB populations in these biotopes showed that SRB species did not have the same capability of resisting oxygen. Analysis of the photooxic zone of cyanobacterial mats revealed a well-defined SRB distribution. Although Desulfobacter and Desulfobacterium were restricted to the deepest levels in the mats, Desulfococcus were predominant in the photooxic zone with Desulfovibrio also present. This distribution suggests that both groups contain oxygen-tolerant members (4.Risatti J.B. Capman W.C. Stahl D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It is thus clear that SRB exhibit a differentiated set of reactions to oxygen: first, many SRB form aggregates (5.Krekeler D. Teske A. Cypionka H. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 1997; 25: 89-96Crossref Google Scholar), resulting in a higher tolerance to oxygen exposure; second, at least Desulfovibrio species migrate in response to the oxygen concentration in their environment (5.Krekeler D. Teske A. Cypionka H. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 1997; 25: 89-96Crossref Google Scholar); and third, many species respire with oxygen (6.Cypionka H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 827-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, although it has been demonstrated that aerobic respiration is coupled with proton translocation and ATP conservation, aerobic growth in pure culture has never been proved (7.Sigavelich P. Cohen Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 5019-5023Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The high respiration rate merely seems to have a protective function. In an oxygen gradient, bacteria form bands at the outer edge of the oxic zone, suggesting both negative and positive aerotaxis responses (8.Johnson M.S. Zhulin I.B. Gapuzan M.-E.R. Taylor B.L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5598-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The capability of SRB to move toward oxygen and reduce it might play an ecological role in the zone of transition from an oxic to an anoxic environment, protecting themselves and other obligate anaerobes from the toxic effects of oxygen and creating an optimal redox environment for bacterial growth. The responses of SRB to the presence of oxygen have been most thoroughly studied in Desulfovibrio species. Various mechanisms of oxygen reduction in Desulfovibrio species have been described. Desulfovibrio gigas is able to generate ATP from internal polyglucose reserves by full reduction of oxygen directly to water. This reduction is linked to NADH oxidation and involves several soluble enzymes and electron transport proteins, the key enzyme being the rubredoxin-oxygen oxidoreductase (9.Fareleira P. Legall J. Xavier A.V. Santos H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Santos H. Fareleira P. Xavier A.V. Chen L. Liu M.Y. LeGall J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). An oxygen-reducing respiratory chain involving a membrane-bound cytochrome bd terminal oxygen reductase has been purified in the same organism (11.Lemos R.S. Gomes C.M. Santana M. LeGall J. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 40-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and genes for a membrane-bound cytochrome c oxidase have been found in D. vulgaris Miyazaki (12.Kitamura M. Mizugai K. Taniguchi M. Akutsu H. Kumagai I. Nakaya T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Genome analysis of D. vulgaris Hildenborough (www.tigr.org) and D. desulfuricans G20 (www.jgi.doe.gov) revealed the presence of both genes for cytochrome c oxidase and cytochrome bd. The involvement of hydrogenase and c-type cytochromes in periplasmic oxygen reduction by Desulfovibrio species was recently proposed (13.Baumgarten A. Redenius I. Kranczoch J. Cypionka H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although these two classes of metalloproteins have been shown to be the key enzymes of the energy-generating metabolism in anaerobic sulfate respiration (14.Odom J.M. Singleton Jr, R. The Sulfate-reducing Bacteria: Contemporary Perspectives. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 41-76Google Scholar), oxygen reduction constitutes a new mechanism in which these two proteins might be involved. Before photosynthetic bacteria, which appeared 2.7 gigayears ago, little or no oxygen was expected in the atmosphere. However, several models are proposed that describe the release of low amounts of oxidative molecules (hydrogen peroxide or molecular oxygen) (15.Freund F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2142-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 16.Bauschlicher C.W. Bakes E. Chem. Phys. 2001; 274: 11-14Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), forcing anaerobic life forms to develop defenses. Because of the ancestral character of microbial sulfate reduction, earlier than the cyanobacterial activity, the mechanism by which sulfate-reducing bacteria resist oxidative stress would represent an ancient critical system developed during earliest life forms. Because Desulfovibrio cells could be in contact with oxygen and even reduce it, they must have developed mechanisms of defense against the reactive oxygen species that are derived from partial oxygen reduction. As a matter of fact, cells contain a number of potential generators of superoxide anion, such as cytochrome, flavodoxin, and ferredoxin. Superoxide dismutase and catalase, which are enzymes well known to eliminate superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in aerobic organisms, have also been characterized in some Desulfovibrio species (17.Dos Santos W.G. Paheco I. Liu M.-Y. Texeira M. Xavier A.V. Legall J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 796-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18.Lumppio H.L. Shevni N.V. Garg R.P. Summers A.O. Voordouw G. Kurtz Jr, D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition to these enzymes, a superoxide reductase (SOR) and a rubrerythrin, which has an NADH-dependent H2O2 reductase activity, have also been found in sulfate-reducing bacteria (19.Moura I.

SOR and rubrerythrin reduce superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, respectively, without regeneration of oxygen, a feature that might be important for oxygen detoxification in anaerobes (23.Jenney F.E. Verhagen M.F.J.M. Cui X. Adams W.W. Science. 1999; 286: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The multiplicity of these enzymes renders the function of each one difficult to assign. Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough contains both SOD and SOR for eliminating superoxide ions (18.Lumppio H.L. Shevni N.V. Garg R.P. Summers A.O. Voordouw G. Kurtz Jr, D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 19.Moura I. Tavares P. Moura J.J.G. Ravi N. Huynh B.H. Liu M.-Y. Legall J. J. Biol.

Following gene deletion, it was proposed that SOR might play a key role in oxygen defense (18.Lumppio H.L. Shevni N.V. Garg R.P. Summers A.O. Voordouw G. Kurtz Jr, D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24.Voordouw J.K. Voordouw G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its periplasmic location, SOD is thought to remove the periplasmic-generated superoxide (25.Fournier M. Zhang Y. Wildschut J.D. Dolla A. Voordouw J.K. Schriemer D.C. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that could induce oxidative damage on sensitive iron-sulfur enzymes. To assign a function to the periplasmic SOD, we report here the effect of oxygen on the periplasmic hydrogenase of D. vulgaris Hildenborough wild-type and sod mutant strains. The physiological protective effect of SOD is described as well as a response mechanism of D. vulgaris cells to the presence of oxygen. Evidence is given for a peculiar function of periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase in the protection against oxidative stress. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—D. vulgaris Hildenborough (26.Postgate J.R. The Sulfate-reducing Bacteria. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1984: 12-13Google Scholar), D. vulgaris SOD100 (SOD100) (23.Jenney F.E. Verhagen M.F.J.M. Cui X. Adams W.W. Science. 1999; 286: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and D. vulgaris HYD100 (HYD100) (27.Pohorelic B.K.J. Voordouw J.K. Lojou E. Dolla A. Harder J. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were cultured in medium C and on solid medium E (26.Postgate J.R. The Sulfate-reducing Bacteria. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1984: 12-13Google Scholar) at 32 °C in an anaerobic chamber (COY) filled with a 5% H2/5% CO2/90% N2 mixed gas atmosphere. Growth medium was supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml) when appropriate. Exposure to Pure Oxygen or Chromate—Cultures (50 ml) of wild-type and mutant strains were grown anaerobically in medium C with kanamycin until A600 was equal to 0.8. These cultures (20 ml) were used to inoculate 200 ml of medium C that was in turn incubated in the anaerobic COY chamber at 32 °C for 24 h. An aliquot of the culture (100 ml) was removed from the anaerobic chamber for pure oxygen flushing at room temperature while the remaining culture was kept in anaerobic conditions in the COY chamber at room temperature. Aliquots (25 ml) of oxygen-flushed and anaerobic cultures were collected after 15, 30, and 60 min, and protein extracts were prepared. Alternatively, aliquots (100 μl) of cultures exposed to oxygen for 60 min were collected and transferred to the anaerobic chamber, serially diluted, and plated on solid medium E. Colonies were counted after 6 days of anaerobic incubation at 32 °C as the number of surviving colony-forming units/ml and compared with the surviving colony-forming units/ml obtained from cells that were not exposed to oxygen. In the case of exposure to ammonium chromate (VI), cells were cultured as described above until A600 was equal to 0.8. 100 μm (NH4)2CrO4 (final concentration) was added to 100 ml of cultures, and aliquots (25 ml) were periodically removed for protein extraction. Change of the redox potential of the medium after either chromium addition or oxygen flushing was measured using a combined redox electrode. Preparations of TE Extracts and Crude Extracts—Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5600 × g, 20 min at 4 °C) and washed once with 1 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl/0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.6). The cell pellets were then resuspended in 0.25 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl/0.1 m EDTA (pH 9) and incubated 30 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation (2000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C), the red supernatant (TE extract) was transferred into a clean tube. To prepare crude extracts, the washed cells were resuspended in 5 ml of 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and lysed by two passes through a Constant Cell Disruption System (2 kilobars). After centrifugation at 5600 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (crude extract) was collected. All buffers used for the extracts preparation were flushed with argon before use. Proteins were quantified using the Bio-Rad DC assay. Hydrogenase Activity on Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (Native PAGE)—10 μg of proteins from either TE extract or crude extract were dried, redissolved in 10 μl of native protein loading sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol (w/v), 0.2% bromphenol blue (w/v)), and loaded onto 12% (w/v) nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis in 0.02 m Tris-HCl/0.2 m glycine buffer (pH 8.3), the gel was incubated in 100 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.6) and bubbled under argon for 20 min. Methyl viologen (0.1 m final concentration) was added, and the solution was flushed with pure hydrogen until the hydrogenase band activities were revealed. The activity staining was fixed by addition of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzodiamine. Stained gels were scanned using the ImageScanner system from APBiotech, and densitometric analyses were performed using the ImageMaster 2D software (APBiotech). Spectrophometric Assays for Hydrogenase Activities—Quantification of hydrogenase activities on the various fractions was performed spectrophotometrically. Hydrogen was used as electron donor and methyl viologen as electron acceptor. The reduction of methyl viologen (1 mm) (ϵ = 13,600 m–1 s–1) was followed at 604 nm in anaerobic cuvettes filled with an oxygen-scavenging system (0.5 unit/ml glucose oxidase, 250 units/ml catalase, and 2.5 mm glucose) in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7). Before starting the reaction, the assay mixture was first bubbled for 10 min with argon then 10 min with hydrogen. Appropriate amounts of protein extracts (from 2.5 to 20 μg) were added, and the kinetics of reduction was recorded. One enzymatic unit of hydrogenase was defined as the amount of enzyme required for the reduction of 1 μmol of methyl viologen per minute. The specific activity was defined as the number of enzymatic units per milligram of proteins. Immunoblotting—Hydrogenases content was followed by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against either [Fe] hydrogenase or [NiFe] hydrogenases from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 7757 and Desulfovibrio fructosovorans, respectively. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting and detection were performed as already described (28.Towbin H. Stachelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44724) Google Scholar). Quantification of immunodetected bands was performed by densitometric analysis after scanning of the blots using the ImageScanner system of APBiotech. Cytochrome c Content—The total amount of cytochrome c in TE extracts was determined spectrophotometrically. Spectra from 260 to 600 nm were recorded on a Kontron Uvicon 922 spectrophotometer. Relative amounts of cytochrome were quantified on the basis of the absorbance of the Soret peak (409 nm) in the oxidized state. Because of the periplasmic location of the D. vulgaris Hildenborough [Fe] superoxide dismutase, it has been proposed that this enzyme is involved in the protection of periplasmic iron-sulfur proteins against superoxide-induced damage (25.Fournier M. Zhang Y. Wildschut J.D. Dolla A. Voordouw J.K. Schriemer D.C. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One of these sensitive enzymes could be the periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase. To confirm this hypothesis, hydrogenase activities of periplasmic fractions of wild-type and SOD100 strains were compared. Hydrogenase activity was directly visualized on native PAGE (Fig. 1). When cells were kept in anaerobic conditions, the intensity of the hydrogenase activity-stained bands detected in both SOD100 and wild-type TE extracts was similar (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). On the other hand, when cells were exposed for 15 min to pure oxygen, the band intensity was higher in the wild-type TE extract than in that of SOD100 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). Densitometric analysis of these bands allowed quantification of about 1.5 times more hydrogenase activity in wild-type than in SOD100 extracts (Fig. 1B). The periplasmic hydrogenase activity appeared to be higher in wild-type than in SOD100 when cells were exposed to oxygen, suggesting that superoxide dismutase protects the hydrogenase from damage induced by superoxide anions. Interestingly, Fig. 1 shows that the hydrogenase activity-stained band was more intense when cells were exposed for 15 min to pure oxygen than when cells were kept in anaerobic conditions. This increase in intensity was detected in both wild-type and SOD100 cells. Periplasmic hydrogenase activity thus appeared to be higher when cells were briefly exposed to pure oxygen than when they were kept in anaerobic conditions. To determine whether this hydrogenase activity increase was specific to the periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase, the same experiment was conducted on crude extracts (Fig. 2A). Although the intensity of the hydrogenase activity band corresponding to the [Fe] hydrogenase increased over the time of exposure to pure oxygen, no significant difference was observed on the upper activity bands that could be attributed to the other hydrogenases ([NiFe] and [NiFeSe] hydrogenases) (Fig. 2A, lanes 3, 5, and 7). As a control, no significant intensity increase was observed during this time period when the cells were kept in anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 6). Intensity measurement was performed by densitometric analysis, and variations are shown in Fig. 2B. An averaged intensity increase in 1.64 times was determined for the [Fe] hydrogenase activity band when cells were exposed to pure oxygen for 60 min. To get more accurate values, hydrogenase activities were quantified by spectrophotometric assay. A specific hydrogenase activity of 10,101 ± 193 units/mg of protein was found in the TE extract of cells exposed for 60 min to pure oxygen, compared with 7,115 ± 181 units/mg of protein for cells kept under anaerobic conditions. This 1.4-fold increase is of the same order as that calculated from the densitometric analysis. At this point, it was unknown whether this activity rise was due to an increase in specific enzyme activity or to an increase in protein synthesis. To answer this question, the amount of hydrogenases in the cells was followed. Western blot and immunodetection analyses using polyclonal antibodies against either [Fe] hydrogenase or [NiFe] hydrogenase were performed to analyze the hydrogenase content of the cells in the presence or absence of oxygen. Although the intensities of the immunodetected bands corresponding to both [NiFe] and [NiFeSe] hydrogenases did not change over the time period of cell exposure to pure oxygen (Fig. 3A), that of the immunodetected band corresponding to the [Fe] hydrogenase increased. The more intense signal was observed when the cells were exposed for 60 min to oxygen. Again, when cells were kept in anaerobic conditions, no significant increase in the amount of [Fe] hydrogenase was detected (Fig. 3B). This experiment shows that the hydrogenase activity rise is related to an increase in protein synthesis and not to an enzyme activation phenomenon. Several studies have pointed out that the periplasmic cytochrome c3 is the physiological electron acceptor of the [Fe] hydrogenase (29.Aubert C. Brugna M. Dolla A. Bruschi M. Giudici-Orticoni M.-T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30.Pereira I.A.C. Romao C.V. Xavier A.V. Legall J. Teixiera M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 494-498Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31.El Antak L. Morelli X. Bornet O. Hatchikian C. Czjzek M. Dolla A. Guerlesquin F. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The UV-visible spectrum of D. vulgaris TE extracts exhibits various absorbance bands, including the Soret peak (Fig. 4A) that are specific to hemoproteins. The evolution of the periplasmic c-type cytochrome content was monitored spectrophotometrically by following the absorbance of the Soret peak (409 nm) in the oxidized state. When the cells were exposed for various times to oxygen, the intensity of the Soret band increased. On the other hand, no change was observed during this time period in the absence of oxygen (Fig. 4B). In a similar way to the [Fe] hydrogenase, the amount of c-type cytochromes in the periplasmic space thus increased in response to the presence of oxygen. From the experiments described above, it can be deduced that the periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase is involved in the immediate response of the cell to the presence of oxygen. To specify the importance of this enzyme, the effect of oxygen was also studied on a mutant strain, D. vulgaris HYD100, in which the gene encoding for this hydrogenase had been deleted (27.Pohorelic B.K.J. Voordouw J.K. Lojou E. Dolla A. Harder J. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Changes in total hydrogenase activity and cytochrome content of HYD100 cells, induced by the presence of oxygen, were followed. Hydrogenase activity-stained PAGE revealed no change in band intensity corresponding to both [NiFe] and [NiFeSe] hydrogenases (data not shown). Neither production nor activity change in any of the remaining hydrogenases was thus observed when the cells were exposed to oxygen to compensate for the absence of the [Fe] hydrogenase in this strain. On the other hand, an increase in the periplasmic cytochrome content was also observed (Table I).Table IEffects of oxygen on both HYD100 viability and cytochrome c contentPeriplasmic cytochrome contentaDetermined from the absorbance of the Soret peak (409 nm).Cell viabilitybDetermined as the number of colony-forming units/ml on medium E.Anaerobic conditionsAfter 1 h of exposure to O2Anaerobic conditionsAfter 1 h of exposure to O2%Wild-type10023310023.3HYD1001001831005a Determined from the absorbance of the Soret peak (409 nm).b Determined as the number of colony-forming units/ml on medium E. Open table in a new tab To relate the [Fe] hydrogenase activity with the capability of the cell to survive oxygen, viability of D. vulgaris wild-type and HYD100 after exposure for 1 h to pure oxygen were compared. While, in the absence of oxygen, both wild-type and HYD100 had the same viability in lactate-sulfate medium, the viability of the two strains differed largely when the cells were exposed to pure oxygen. Colonies counting on plates showed that 5% of HYD100 were able to survive 1 h of exposure to oxygen, whereas 23.3% survivors were found for the wild-type in the same conditions (Table I). The [Fe] hydrogenase appears to be highly involved in the cellular mechanisms allowing cells to survive exposure to oxygen. Two factors must be considered when cells are exposed to oxygen: first, the direct effect of oxygen that might inactivate some enzymes and, second, an increase in the redox potential of the medium. One way of distinguishing between these two effects is to use chemical oxidant compounds instead of oxygen. The redox potentials E′0 of the couples ½O2/H2O and Cr(VI)O42-/Cr(III)(OH)3 are very similar (820 and 800 mV, respectively). It is thus expected that, in terms of redox potential effects, oxygen and chromium would have almost the same consequences on the redox potential of the cell environment. When 100 μm ammonium chromate was added to 100 ml of D. vulgaris Hildenborough culture in medium C, the redox potential quickly increased and then decreased to its initial value. The increase of the redox potential is of the same order as when the culture is flushed with pure oxygen as described above (Fig. 5A). An increase of the hydrogenase activity in the TE extracts was observed (Fig. 5B). Hydrogenase activity increased to reach a maximum 30 min after chromate addition and then decreased to its initial value. Similar changes in the cytochrome content were observed (data not shown) with a maximum cytochrome c content reached 30 min after chromate addition. Chromate addition has thus the same consequences as flushing with pure oxygen on D. vulgaris cells concerning both hydrogenase and cytochrome contents. It has been proposed that D. vulgaris Hildenborough superoxide reductase (SOR) is involved in the elimination of cytoplasmic superoxide anions produced subsequent to partial oxygen reduction by either soluble or membrane-bound oxygen reductases (18.Lumppio H.L. Shevni N.V. Garg R.P. Summers A.O. Voordouw G. Kurtz Jr, D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24.Voordouw J.K. Voordouw G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, [Fe] SOD is a periplasmic protein. Periplasmic [CuZn] superoxide dismutases of several Gram-negative pathogens can protect against superoxide-radical-mediated host defenses and thus contribute to virulence (32.Sansone A. Watson P.R. Wallis T.S. Langford P.R. Kroll J.S. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because D. vulgaris Hildenborough is not a pathogen, this function is improbable. The periplasmic space of D. vulgaris contains a lot of low redox potential enzymes that might generate superoxide anions in the presence of oxygen. If not scavenged, superoxide anions would induce damage in the forms of oxidation and destabilization of iron-sulfur clusters of some enzymes and lead to their inactivation (33.Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The [Fe] superoxide dismutase could thus be involved in the elimination of periplasmic-generated superoxides, preventing sensitive enzymes inactivation. In fact, Desulfovibrio periplasm contains several iron-sulfur-containing enzymes (hydrogenases or formate-dehydrogenases) involved in the energetic metabolism of the cell (27.Pohorelic B.K.J. Voordouw J.K. Lojou E. Dolla A. Harder J. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34.Lissolo T. Choi E.S. Legall J. Peck Jr, H.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35.Sebban C. Blanchard L. Bruschi M. Guerlesquin F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 133: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that might be sensitive to superoxide anions. [Fe] hydrogenase is one of the most abundant iron-sulfur enzymes in the D. vulgaris periplasm. This enzyme is composed of two subunits that coordinate two [4Fe-4S] clusters in a ferredoxin-like domain and an H-cluster composed of a typical [4Fe-4S] cubane bridged to a binuclear active site iron center (36.Nicolet Y. Piras C. Legrand P. Hatchikian C.E. Fonticella-Camps J.C. Structure. 1999; 7: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). This high content of iron-sulfur clusters renders this hydrogenase a good model of a superoxide-sensitive enzyme. To experimentally assign a function to the periplasmic [Fe] SOD of D. vulgaris, sensitivity of the [Fe] hydrogenase was thus followed in vivo in both D. vulgaris Hildenborough wild-type and the sod-deleted strains (SOD100). Our results show that hydrogenase activity is higher in wild-type than in SOD100 strains when cells are exposed to pure oxygen for a short time. Sensitivity of hydrogenase is thus higher in the SOD100 strain than in the wild-type. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the periplasmic superoxide dismutase is involved in the protection of sensitive enzymes against superoxide-induced damage. An intriguing point is that in both strains (i.e. wild-type and SOD100), total hydrogenase activity in the periplasmic space increased when the cells were exposed to oxygen. This hydrogenase activity rise was related to an increase in the amount of protein as shown by immunoblotting. On the other hand, this phenomenon was only observed for the periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase, because no difference was detected concerning the other hydrogenases. Our data show that D. vulgaris [Fe] hydrogenase synthesis is induced when the cells are exposed to pure oxygen. Up-regulation of the [Fe] hydrogenase synthesis by oxygen is a new mechanism indicated here for the first time. [Fe] hydrogenase is a key enzyme for the dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Its physiological function has been shown to be hydrogen uptake when both hydrogen and lactate are electron donors for sulfate reduction (27.Pohorelic B.K.J. Voordouw J.K. Lojou E. Dolla A. Harder J. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and hydrogen production with pyruvate and lactate as electron donors in the absence of sulfate (37.Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 184: 5903-5911Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments have shown that hydrogenases are oxygen-sensitive enzymes (38.Adams M.W.W. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7045-7055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.van Dijk C. van Berkel-Arts A. Veeger C. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 340-344Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is thus surprising that the presence of oxygen up-regulates the synthesis of the enzyme. In the same way, the periplasmic cytochrome content increases when cells are exposed to oxygen. This phenomenon has already been described for D. desulfuricans. The authors reported that, under continuous culture conditions with low oxygen partial pressures, the cytochrome c content increased by about 20% (40.Abdollahi H. Wimpenny J.W.T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1025-1030Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although our experimental conditions were different the same effect, namely the presence of oxygen on the cytochrome c content, was observed. Several deleterious effects of oxygen on SRB must be considered. When oxygen penetrates into the cell it can inhibit sulfate reduction, probably because of the inactivation of some key enzymes. Moreover, reactive oxygen species are generated leading to various damage to proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids (41.Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). One response of the cell for eliminating oxygen is to reduce it. It has been shown that oxygen reduction by D. vulgaris Marburg mainly occurred in the periplasm and that this reduction was hydrogenase/cytochrome-dependent (13.Baumgarten A. Redenius I. Kranczoch J. Cypionka H. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our experiments suggest that both D. vulgaris Hildenborough periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase and cytochromes are involved in oxygen reduction as well. In response to the presence of oxygen, cells increase the amount of both proteins in the periplasm to increase oxygen reduction rate and thus eliminate it. The fact that, after exposure to oxygen, viability of the strain lacking the gene encoding [Fe] hydrogenase (HYD100) is about four times lower than that of wild-type is in complete agreement with an important function of [Fe] hydrogenase in the protection against oxygen stress. On the other hand, the presence of oxygen strongly modifies the physicochemical parameters of the environment. First, it causes a chemical oxidation of hydrogen sulfide produced by the cell from sulfate respiration. Second, the redox potential of the culture increases with increasing oxygen concentration (40.Abdollahi H. Wimpenny J.W.T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1025-1030Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This redox environment change might cause a stress to the cells. Ammonium chromate (VI) is a strong oxidizer, and its addition to the medium induces a rapid redox potential increase. In our experimental conditions, the addition of chromate to the culture induces a similar redox potential increase as that observed when the culture is flushed with pure oxygen. It is noteworthy that, in the presence of chromate, both cytochrome and [Fe] hydrogenase synthesis increase. The response of the cells is the same as in the case of the presence of oxygen. It appears that the [Fe] hydrogenase is involved in the response to an oxidative stress induced by either the presence of oxygen or a strong redox potential increase. What might be the role of the [Fe] hydrogenase in the protection against oxidative stress? As discussed above, this enzyme, coupled to cytochromes, could be directly involved in the elimination of oxygen by reduction to water. The [Fe] hydrogenase could also be involved in a mechanism devoted to the decrease of the environmental redox potential to obtain optimal conditions for cell growth. A few years ago, we reported that, in addition to the transmembrane electron transport from hydrogen to sulfate, which normally occurs during dissimilatory sulfate reduction, the redox reactions driven by the Hmc complex are crucial for the establishment of the required low redox niche necessary for cell development (42.Dolla A. Pohorelic B.K.J. Voordouw J.K. Voordouw G. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One can thus imagine that the periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase participates in these mechanisms by supplying electrons to the Hmc complex. On the other hand, electrons derived from hydrogen uptake by the [Fe] hydrogenase could be driven to other electron transport systems that have to be characterized. For example, one of these systems could be the outer membrane-bound cytochromes (43.van Ommen Kloeke F. Bryant R.D. Laishley E.J. Anaerobe. 1995; 1: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) that might drive low potential electrons to the cell surface. A third hypothesis that cannot be ruled out is that an oxidative stress might induce a modification of the hydrogen metabolism leading to an increase of hydrogenase activity, either uptake or production. Such a modification has recently been reported for another obligate anaerobe, namely Thermotoga neapolitana. The authors reported that the rate of hydrogen production increased when low levels of oxygen were provided (44.Van Ooteghem S.A. Beer S.K. Yue P.C. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2002; 98–100: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrate that [Fe] hydrogenase is up-regulated in response to an oxidative stress in the anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacterium D. vulgaris Hildenborough. This is the first time that involvement of [Fe] hydrogenase in the protection against oxidative stress has been pointed out. Because of the ancestral character of sulfate reduction (1.Shen Y. Buick R. Canfield D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), such a function of [Fe] hydrogenase might represent one of the earliest mechanisms to protect the cells against an oxidative stress. Further studies are necessary to obtain a better understanding of the function of this enzyme during oxidative stress and to indicate other original systems involved in this stress. We thank Dr. C. Hatchikian (Laboratoire de Bioénergétique et Ingénierie des Protéines, CNRS) for providing us with antibodies against D. desulfuricans [Fe] hydrogenase. We are indebted to N.

https://openalex.org/W2055065992,"Free radical-initiated lipid autoxidation in low density lipoprotein (LDL) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Oxidation of the lipid components of LDL leads to a complex mixture of hydroperoxides, bicyclic endoperoxides, monocyclic peroxides, and serial cyclic peroxides. The oxidation compounds and/or their decomposition products can modify protein components, which may lead to various diseases. A novel class of peroxides (termed dioxolane-isoprostanes) having a bicyclic endoperoxide moiety characteristic of the isoprostanes and a dioxolane peroxide functionality in the same molecule was identified in the product mixture formed from in vitro autoxidation of cholesteryl arachidonate. The same products are also detected in in vitro oxidized LDL. Various mass spectrometric techniques have been applied to characterize these new peroxides. The structure of these compounds has also been confirmed by independent synthesis. We reason, based on the free radical mechanism of the transformation, that only the 12- and 8-peroxyl radicals (those leading to 12-HPETE and 8-HPETE) of arachidonate can form these new peroxides. We also suggest that the formation of these peroxides provides a rationale to explain the fact that 5- and 15-series isoprostanes are formed in preference to 8- and 12-series. Furthermore, series of other isoprostanes, such as dioxolane A2, D2, E2, etc., can be derived from the dioxolane-isoprostane peroxides. These findings offer further insights into the oxidation products of arachidonate and the opportunity to study their potential biological relevance.

Arachidonic acid is a ubiquitous polyunsaturated fatty acid in mammalian cellular membranes. Recent experimental observations show that enzymatic oxidation products derived from arachidonic acid play an important role in the control of organ physiology (1Funk C.D.

Academic Press, Inc., New York1980: 261-295Google Scholar). On the other hand, oxidation of arachidonic acid or its esters can occur by a non-enzymatic free radical process. Some of the oxidation products of these non-enzymatic peroxidations have been linked to human disease states. In particular, oxidative modification of the lipid components of low density lipoprotein, the major carrier of cholesteryl esters in human blood, has been attributed to the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis (7Patel R.P.

The free radical initiated oxidation of arachidonic acid or its esters is extremely complicated because of the fact that insertion of molecular oxygen may occur at C5, C8, C9, C11, C12, or C15 of the 20-carbon fatty acid chain. The resultant peroxyl radicals can undergo further reactions to give a complex mixture of primary hydroperoxides and cyclic peroxides with dozens of regioisomers and diastereomers (8Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Google Scholar). Furthermore, these unstable peroxides can decompose and give rise to other reactive products, such as malondialdehyde, γ-ketoaldehydes (such as levuglandins, LGs), and 4-hydroxy nonenal (9Esterbauer H. Zollner H. Schauer R.J. Vigo-Pelfrey, C. Membrane Lipid Oxidaiton. Vol. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 239-268Google Scholar, 10Esterbauer H. Schauer R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6948-6955Google Scholar). A number of oxidation products from arachidonate autoxidation have been characterized and their biological activities are a major research focus (Scheme 1). Bicyclic endoperoxides (1a), monocyclic peroxides (1b), and serial cyclic peroxides (1c) have previously been characterized from the mixture of products formed in the autoxidation of cholesteryl arachidonate (8Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Google Scholar, 12Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Google Scholar, 13Yin H.

Oxidation products having a tetrahydrofuran moiety (1d) were recently characterized under conditions of reaction having increased oxygen tension (14Fessel J.P. Porter N.A. Moore K.P. Sheller J.R. Roberts Jr., L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16713-16718Google Scholar). The epoxyisoprostanes (1e) and epoxycyclopentenones (1f) are probably derived from the bicyclic endoperoxides (15Subbangounder G. Wong J.W. Lee H. Faull K.F. Miller E. Witztum J.L. Berliner J.A. J.

Measurement of isoprostanes, the reduced compounds of bicyclic endoperoxides, in biological fluids or tissues has been regarded as one of the most useful non-invasive biomarkers for oxidative stress status (17Morrow J.D.

Previous experimental observations showed that 5- and 15-series (numbers refer to the position of hydroxyl group on the side chain) isoprostanes are more abundant than those of 8- and 12-series (12Yin H.

We report herein that a novel class of compounds that have a bicyclic endoperoxide moiety and a cyclic peroxide functionality in the same molecule is formed in arachidonate oxidations. A variety of mass spectrometric methods have been developed to characterize these new compounds from the in vitro oxidation mixture of arachidonic acid or its esters. These compounds are named dioxolane-isoprostanes peroxides for convenience here because their structures are closely related to the isoprostanes but they have an additional dioxolane functional group. These compounds are also found as products from in vitro oxidized LDL. They may have biological relevance because of the presence of the reactive bicyclic endoperoxide functionality. All lipid autoxidation reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of oxygen unless otherwise noted. Air and argon were passed through a bed of calcium sulfate desiccant. Benzene was distilled from sodium and stored over 4A molecular sieves. Tetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane were dried by Solv-Tek (Berryville, VA) solvent purification columns using activated alumina for drying and Q-5 packing for deoxygenating the solvents. Oxygen (medical grade) was obtained from A. L. Compressed Gas (Nashville, TN). HPLC grade solvents were purchased from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI) or EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ). All lipids were purchased from NuChek Prep (Elysian, MI) and were of the highest purity (>99%). The free radical initiator di-tert-butyl hyponitrite was synthesized prior to use (22Mendenhall G.D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1983; 24: 451-452Google Scholar, 23Kiefer H. Trayler T.G. Tetrahedron Lett. 1966; 7: 6163-6168Google Scholar). 2,2′-Azobis[2-(2-imdazolin-2-yl)propane] dihydrochloride (C-0) was generously donated by Wako Chemicals USA Inc. (Richmond, VA). N,O-Bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide was purchased from Supelco Inc. (Bellefonte, PA). PGF2α, PGF3α, and 1a,1b-dihomo-PGF2α were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). All other reagents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. Reactions involving hydroperoxides were visualized by TLC using a stain of 1.5 g of N,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, 25 ml of H2O, 125 ml of MeOH, 1 ml of acetic acid. Hydroperoxides yield an immediate pink color, whereas cyclic peroxides exhibit a pink color after mild charring. General TLC staining was accomplished by iodine or use of a phosphomolybdic acid stain prepared as a 20% (w/v) solution in EtOH. In general, hydroperoxides were stored as dilute solutions with 1 mol % butylated hydroxytoluene in either hexanes or benzene at -78 °C and were never exposed to temperatures >40 °C. Flash column chromatography was performed using 35-70-μm silica gel. Thin layer chromatography was performed using 0.2-mm layer thickness silica gel-coated aluminum (60 F254, EM Industries), and TLC plates were analyzed using UV light (254 nm) with a Mineralight UVSL-25 hand lamp. Preparative TLC was performed on Silica Gel 60ALK6D plates (Whatman). Analytical HPLC was carried out using a Waters model 600E pump with a Waters 996 Photodiode array detector. Millenium32 chromatography software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) was used to control the 996 and to collect and process data. Cyclic peroxide analysis by analytical HPLC utilized a single Beckman Ultrasphere 5μ (4.6 mm × 25 cm) silica column. A flow rate of 1 ml/min was used for analytical NP HPLC. Preparative HPLC was performed using a Dynamax-60 Å 8-μm (83-121-C) silica column (21.4 mm × 25 cm) with a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Narrowbore HPLC for MS analysis used a single Beckman ultrasphere 5 μm (2.0 mm × 25 cm) silica column for analysis of cyclic peroxides and two Beckman Ultrasphere 5-μm (2.0 mm × 25 cm) silica columns for acyclic hydroperoxide analysis. Coordination ion spray mass spectrometry (CIS-MS) was accomplished using a Finnigan TSQ-7000 (San Jose, CA) triple quadrapole mass spectrometer operating in positive ion mode equipped with a standard API-1 electrospray ionization source. The source was outfitted with a 100-μ deactivated fused silica capillary. Data acquisition and evaluation were conducted on ICIS EXECUTIVE INST, version 8.3.2, and TSQ 7000 software INST, version 8.3. Data collected for selected reaction monitoring (SRM) experiments was also processed using Xcalibur, version 1 (Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Nitrogen gas served both as sheath gas and auxiliary gas; argon served as the collision gas. The electrospray needle was maintained at 4.6 kV and the heated capillary temperature was 200 °C. The tube lens potential and capillary voltage were optimized to maximize ion current for electrospray, with the optimal determined to be 80 and 20 V, respectively, for cholesteryl ester analysis. Positive ions were detected scanning from 100 to 1000 atomic mass units with a scan duration of 1 s. Profile data was recorded for 1 min and averaged for analysis. For CID experiments the collision gas pressure was set from 2.30 to 2.56 millitesla. To obtain fragmentation information of each compound, the dependence of offset-voltage and relative ion current was studied. The collision energy offset was varied from 10 to 40 eV depending on the compound being analyzed. Samples were introduced either by direct liquid infusion or by HPLC. For direct liquid injection, stock solutions of the lipids (100 ng/μl in 1% isopropyl alcohol in hexane) were prepared and mixed 1:1 with silver tetrafluoroborate (51.4 ng/μl in isopropyl alcohol). Samples were introduced to the ESI source by syringe pump at a rate of 10 μl/min. For HPLC sample introduction a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC system was used. The auxiliary gas flow rate to the ESI interface was increased to between 5 and 10 units to assist in desolvation of the samples. For cholesteryl arachidonate hydroperoxide analysis, normal phase HPLC sample introduction was carried out using two tandem Beckman Ultrasphere narrowbore 5-μ silica columns (2.0 mm × 25 cm) operated in isocratic mode with 0.35% isopropyl alcohol in hexanes. For analysis of cyclic peroxide mixtures, sample introduction was carried out using a single Beckman Ultrasphere narrowbore 5-μ silica column (2.0 mm × 25 cm) operated in isocratic mode with 1.0% isopropyl alcohol in hexanes. The flow rate for both modes of chromatography was 150 μl/min. Column effluent was passed through an Applied Biosystems 785A programmable absorbance UV detector with detection at 234 nm. An Upchurch high pressure mixing tee was connected next in series for the post-column addition of the silver salts. The silver tetrafluoroborate (AgBF4) solution (0.25 mm in isopropyl alcohol) was added via a Harvard Apparatus (Cambridge, MA) syringe pump at a flow rate of 75 μl/min. A long section of PEEK tubing (1.04 m, 0.25-mm inner diameter) allowed time for the complexation of the silver to the lipid while delivering effluent to the mass spectrometer. A Rheodyne 7725 injector was fitted with a 100-μl PEEK loop for 20-50-μl sample injections. A PPh3-reduced oxidation mixture of 12-HPETE was analyzed by negative ion ESI-MS coupled with reverse-phase HPLC separation using a Supelco Discovery® C18 column (15 cm × 2.1 mm, 5 μ) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a linear gradient starting with 75% solvent A (0.05% acetic acid) to 20% in 40 min. Mobile phase B consists of acetonitrile/methanol (95/5). LC-APCI ECNI-MS was performed on the same instrument TSQ-7000 using an APCI ion source. The mass spectrometer operating conditions were as follows: vaporizer temperature was 475 °C, heated capillary at 300 °C, with the corona discharge needle set at 16 μA (24Singh G. Gutierrez A. Xu K. Blair I.A. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 3007-3013Google Scholar). The pressure of sheath gas and auxiliary gas was optimized for maximal response. For full scan and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) analyses, unit resolution was maintained for both parent and daughter ions. GC-NICI MS was performed using a Hewlett-Packard HP5989A GC/MS instrument interfaced with an IBM Pentium II computer system. GC was performed using a 30 m, 0.25-mm diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness DB-Wax column (J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA) or 15 m, 0.25-mm diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness, DB 1701 fused silica capillary column (Fison, Folsom, CA). The column temperature was programmed from 190 to 260 °C at 10 °C/min. Methane was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Ion source temperature was 250 °C, electron energy was 70 eV, and filament current was 0.25 mA. Lipid autoxidations were performed at 37.0 ± 0.2 °C and temperature was controlled using an I2R Thermo-watch ML6-1000SS. In a round-bottomed flask, cholesteryl arachidonate (400 mg, 0.584 mmol) was dissolved in benzene to make a solution of 0.15 m. To the mixture were added 0.5 eq of methyl trolox (methyl 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylate) (25Suarna C. Dean R.T. Southwellkeely P.T. Aust. J. Chem. 1997; 50: 1129Google Scholar) and 0.1 eq of di-tert-butyl hyponitrite. The reaction was stirred under oxygen at 37 °C for 24 h. The reaction was quenched by adding 2 mg of butylated hydroxytoluene. Analytical HPLC (tandem Si column, 0.5% isopropyl alcohol in hexane, λ = 234 nm) indicated seven major fractions: A, tR = 13.80 min, 15-HPETE; B, tR = 14.54 min, 12-HPETE; C, tR = 16.11 min, 11-HPETE; D, tR = 20.91 min, 9-HPETE; E, tR = 21.29 min, 8-HPETE; F, tR = 26.11 min, 5-HPETE; G, tR = 51.30 min, methyl trolox. The excess hydrogen atom donor methyl trolox was separated by flash column chromatography on silica using solvent mixture of hexane:ethyl acetate (9:1). All the peroxide stain-positive fractions were combined and separated by semi-preparative HPLC (0.5% isopropyl alcohol in hexane, 234 nm). Components D and E were collected as a mixture. The primary hydroperoxides separated by HPLC were converted to more highly oxidized peroxides according to our previous procedure (8Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Google Scholar). Oxidized lipid derived from ∼0.13 μmol of lipid hydroperoxides was dissolved in 200 μl of ethanol and 200 μl of ethyl acetate. Approximately 5 mg of Pd-C was added to the mixture and hydrogenation was performed in a hydrogenator with a H2 pressure of 50 p.s.i. for 1 h. The mixture was filtered. The solution was subjected to basic hydrolysis using 8.0 m KOH for 60 min at 40 °C. After adjusting the pH to 1-3, the mixture was loaded on a C18 SepPak (Waters Associates) cartridge that was preconditioned with 5 ml of methanol and then 5 ml of water. The column was washed with 5 ml of water and 5 ml of heptane. The eluent of 10 ml of ethyl acetate was collected. The solution was dried over NaSO4. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue was dissolved in 20 μl of CH3CN. To the resulting solution was added 20 μl of 10% (v/v) pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile and 10 μl of 10% (v/v) N,N-diisopropylethylamine in acetonitrile and the mixture was kept at room temperature for 30 min. The reagent was dried under nitrogen and the residue was subjected to TLC separation using the solvent ethyl acetate/methanol (98/2, v/v). Approximately 5 μg of the PFB ester of PGF2α was applied on a separate lane and visualized by spraying with a 10% solution of phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol followed by heating. Compounds migrating in the region of the PFB ester of PGF2α (R = 0.4) and the adjacent area 4 cm above and under were scrapped and extracted from the silica gel by ethyl acetate. The PFB esters after TLC separation can be directly used for LC-APCI/MS studies or further derivatized to TMS derivatives for GC-MS analysis. After evaporation of the ethyl acetate, 20 μl of N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and 10 μl of dimethylformamide were added to the residue and the mixture was incubated at 40 °C for 20 min. The reagents were dried under nitrogen and the derivatives were dissolved in 10 μl of dry undecane for analysis of GC-MS. Lipoprotein Isolation Procedures (26Havrilla C.M. Ph.D. dissertation. Duke University, Durham, NC2000Google Scholar)—Whole blood from fasting, normolipidemic healthy subjects was collected in a 440-ml ACD blood collection bag (Baxter-Fenwal). The blood bag was centrifuged at 4200 rpm for 10 min at 22 °C and the plasma was collected. LDL (1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml) were isolated from plasma by sequential floatation ultracentrifugation (27Schmaker V.N. Pupione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Google Scholar) at 14 °C using a Beckman Optima LE 80 centrifuge and a Ti 70 rotor. Each spin was performed at 504,000 × g for 5.5 h. Lipoproteins were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline, sterilized by passage through a Millipore Millex®-GV (0.22-μm Filter Unit), and stored at 4 °C under argon. Protein concentrations of the lipoprotein preparations were determined by the method of Lowry. LDL isolation was confirmed with the use of SDS-PAGE separation of associated apoproteins and Beckman LIPO gel electrophoresis of intact lipoproteins (28Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 269-489Google Scholar). Oxidation and Extraction of Lipoproteins—The lipoprotein concentrations were adjusted to either 1.5 mg of protein/ml or 0.75 mg of protein/ml with phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to equilibrate to 37 °C for 5 min in a round bottom flask before the initial aliquot was removed. Initiator C0 (100 mm stock solution) was added to the stirred solution to give the final C0 concentration, typically 1 mm for the 1.5 mg/ml LDL solution or 0.5 mm C0 for the 0.75 mg/ml LDL solution. Immediately after the addition of C0 (time 0) and at various time intervals, LDL aliquots (500 μl) were taken for analysis of the secondary oxidation products. Each of these aliquots was treated with 50 μl of butylated hydroxytoluene and the lipids were extracted with a Folch extraction (29Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 226: 497-509Google Scholar). For the Folch extraction procedure, to each 500-μl aliquot of LDL was added methanol (3.0 ml) and chloroform (6.0 ml) with a 30-s vortexing period in between each solvent addition. To the homogenous solution was added 0.74% aqueous KCl (1.75 ml) and the mixture was vortexed for 1 min to properly separate the phases. The solution was centrifuged for 10 min to separate the layers. The top phase was removed and discarded. The lower layer was treated with anhydrous sodium sulfate and placed on an ice bath for 15 min. The drying agent was filtered from the solution and the organic layer was concentrated under a stream of argon. The lipid residues were combined and transferred to a vial for storage. Separation of lipid classes of LDL was achieved by modification of a method reported by Homan et al. (30Homan R. Anderson M.K. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1998; 708: 21-26Google Scholar) using an aminopropyl HPLC column by Milne (31Milne G.L. Ph.D. dissertation. Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN2002Google Scholar). A mixed solvent systems was used, which includes Solvent A: hexanes-THF (99:1); Solvent B: acetone-CH2Cl2 (2:1); Solvent C: isopropyl alcohol/water (85:15). The separated lipid fractions, such as cholesterol esters and phospholipids, were derivatized for GC-MS analysis according to the protocol of derivatizing cholesteryl arachidonate oxidation products mentioned in the previous section. A solution of 5 mg of PGF3α was subjected to PFB esterification. The PFB ester was separated by flash chromatography using ethyl acetate and hexane (1:4). The structure of the product was characterized by 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR. The 1,3-diol on the cyclopentane ring was protected by formation of butylboronate. The C15 hydroxyl group was transformed to diethylphosphite by reaction of the protected PGF3α with triethylamine and chlorodiethylphosphite (32Nagata N. Kawakami M. Matsuura T. Saito I. Tetrahedron Lett. 1989; 30: 2817-2820Google Scholar). 15-OOH PGF3α PFB ester was synthesized by treatment of the phosphite with anhydrous H2O2. The butylboronate was removed in the same reaction. The separation of 15-OOH PGF3α PFB was achieved by HPLC using 12% isopropyl alcohol in hexane. The oxidation of 15-OOH PGF3α PFB was carried out in benzene with di-tert-butyl hyponitrite as radical initiator. The oxidation mixture was subject to MS analysis for the formation of dioxolane-isoprostane peroxide compounds. Formation of Dioxolane-Isoprostane Peroxides from 12-HPETE Ch by a Free Radical Mechanism—The oxidation of arachidonic acid gives rise to a complex mixture of products. Six different peroxyl radicals are formed from arachidonate and each of these peroxyl radicals can be converted to the corresponding HPETE by a hydrogen abstraction reaction. A set of cyclic peroxides and endoperoxides specific to each peroxyl radical can also form making analysis of the mixture difficult. The analytical problem can be significantly simplified by examination of products that form from specific peroxyl radicals. To do this, individual hydroperoxides (HPETEs) are used as starting materials for further oxidation. Thus 12-HPETE, when exposed to free radical initiators, serves as a precursor to the corresponding peroxyl radical. Consequently, the set of products derived only from the 12-peroxyl radical form when 12-HPETE is used as a starting material. Characterization of the oxidation products that derive from the individual hydroperoxides greatly simplifies the analytical problem and provides mechanistic insights for the autoxidation process (13Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Gao L. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16720-16725Google Scholar). To implement this strategy, we separated the regioisomeric hydroperoxides of cholesteryl arachidonate by semipreparative HPLC and exposed the pure regioisomeric hydroperoxides, namely the 15-, 11-, 12-, 8/9-, and 5-HPETEs to free radical initiators under air. We note that 8- and 9-HPETE Ch cannot be separated under normal phase HPLC conditions. Some preliminary results using this strategy have been previously reported for 15-, 11-, and 5-HPETE Ch (8Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Google Scholar). When 12-HPETE Ch was subjected to reaction under oxygen with free radical initiators, a complex mixture of cholesterol ester peroxides was generated and this mixture was subjected to a variety of analytical procedures, described below. Characterization of Dioxolane-Isoprostane Peroxides from Oxidation of 12-HPETE Ch by Silver CIS MS in Combination of HPLC—The characterization of organic peroxides by mass spectrometry has seen limited use because of the instability of these compounds (33Yin H. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 1248-1254Google Scholar, 34Rondeau D. Vogel R. Tabet J.-C. J. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 38: 931-940Google Scholar). Some structural information can be obtained from standard ionization techniques but hydroperoxides, in particular, have a propensity to dehydrate when subjected to many of the common ionization methods. Very recently, silver CIS MS has been successfully applied to study simple organic peroxides as well as the mixtures of peroxides generated from lipid autoxidation (8Havrilla C.M. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 8042-8055Google Scholar, 12Yin H. Havrilla C.M. Morrow J.D. Porter N.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7745-7754Google Scholar, 35Yin H. Hachey D.L. Porter N.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 12: 449-455Google Scholar). Specific fragmentation at the peroxyl functionality occurs when silver ion is coordinated to double bonds or aromatics of unsaturated hydroperoxides. The oxidation mixture of 12-HPETE Ch was first analyzed by direct liquid infusion using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The parent ion information is shown in Fig. 1. The doublet-like peaks are characteristic of silver adducts because silver has two isotopes, 107 and 109, having almost equal abundance. 12-HPETE Ch silver ion adducts are observed at m/z 811/813, whereas the peaks at m/z 793/795 and 795/797 correspond to the corresponding alcohol and ketone. The ketone and alcohol are products that result from the termination of two peroxyl radicals. The monocyclic peroxides and bicyclic endoperoxides (such as 2d and 2g, respectively) have m/z 843/845, whereas the peaks in the region m/z 827/829 would likely be because of termination products of the peroxyl radicals leading to these compounds. The peaks observed at m"

In Escherichia coli and most other bacteria, ACC is composed of four subunits encoded by accA, accB, accC, and accD. Prior work from this laboratory showed that the in vivo expression of the accBC operon had a strikingly nonlinear response to gene copy number (Li, S.-J, and Cronan, J. E., Jr. (1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 332–340) in that the presence of 50 or more copies of the accBC operon resulted in only a 2–3-fold increase in AccB and AccC. We now report that AccB functions to negatively regulate transcription of the accBC operon. Expression of a chimeric protein consisting of the N terminus of E. coli AccB and the C-terminal bioinylation domain of Bacillus subtilis AccB down-regulated transcription of the E. coli accBC operon. A truncated form of AccB consisting of the N-terminal 68 amino acids of E. coli AccB was sufficient to negatively regulate the accBC operon. In vivo bypass of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity by expression of a malonyl-CoA synthase from Rhizobium trifolii allowed construction of strain deleted for the accA and accB genes. Unexpectedly, the ΔaccB mutation could not be resolved from the ΔaccA mutation. Transcription of the accBC operon in the ΔaccB ΔaccA strain continued well into stationary phase under growth conditions that normally result in greatly decreased transcription. These data support a model in which AccB acts as an autoregulator of accBC operon transcription.

Although Escherichia coli has been a paradigm for the study of fatty acid-containing membrane lipids, several aspects of the regulation of E. coli fatty acid synthesis remain unclear. A number of potential control points in the pathway exist. Blockage of phospholipid biosynthesis causes an accumulation of derivatives of acyl carrier protein (ACP) 1The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; BCCP, biotin carboxyl carrier protein; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; kb, kilobase pair; MOPS, sodium 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; DIG, digoxigenin. acylated with fatty acids and a dramatic decrease in the rate of fatty acid biosynthesis. The inhibition of fatty acid synthesis can be reversed by cleavage of the acyl-ACPs (1.Jiang P. Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that such species might inhibit fatty acid synthetic enzymes. Acyl-ACPs were subsequently been shown in vitro to inhibit the enoyl-ACP reductase, 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activities of E. coli (2.Davis M.S. Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1499-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3.Price A.C. Choi K.H. Heath R.J. Li Z. White S.W. Rock C.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1833-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid metabolism, the ATP-dependent formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA and bicarbonate. In contrast to eucaryotic forms, the E. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase is composed of four distinct proteins; biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP; AccB), biotin carboxylase (AccC), and two proteins (AccA and AccD) catalyzing the carboxyltransferase partial reaction (7.Cronan Jr., J.E. Waldrop G.L. Prog. Lipid. Res. 2002; 41: 407-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA takes place in two steps. Biotin carboxylase catalyzes the first reaction by transferring CO2 in an ATP-dependent fashion from bicarbonate to the biotin moiety of AccB, resulting in carboxybiotinoyl-AccB. The CO2 group is subsequently transferred from the carboxybiotin moiety to acetyl-CoA by the carboxyltransferase subunits, resulting in malonyl-CoA formation (7.Cronan Jr., J.E. Waldrop G.L. Prog. Lipid. Res. 2002; 41: 407-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). ACC seems an appropriate target for regulation of the fatty acid synthetic pathway. This reaction is the first committed step in fatty acid metabolism. In E. coli ACC has recently been demonstrated in vivo to be a rate-limiting step since increased levels of E. coli ACC increased the rate of fatty acid synthesis (8.Davis M.S. Solbiati J. Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28593-28598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Additionally, the only known fate in E. coli of malonyl-CoA, the ACC product is in the synthesis of fatty acids. Since 94% of the ATP used in membrane phospholipid synthesis is consumed occurs during fatty acid synthesis, controlling malonyl-CoA production would be energy efficient (9.Jackowski S. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991: 43-85Google Scholar). The rates of transcription of all four acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes are regulated with respect to growth rate (10.Li S.J. Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The accB and accC genes form an operon and have pattern of regulation that differs from that of the unlinked accA and accD genes (10.Li S.J. Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the accB and accC are frequently adjacent genes even in bacteria only distantly related to E. coli. Of 90 sequenced microbial genomes surveyed, 75 organisms (encompassing 54 distinct species) retain the accB and accC genes in a genomic organization suggestive of cotranscription. This result suggests that coregulation of these two genes may be a widely conserved and important feature of cellular metabolism. This hypothesis has been directly demonstrated in a Gram-positive organism, Bacillus subtilis, in which the accBC genes were shown to be growth-rate regulated in a manner analogous to that of E. coli (11.Marini P.E. Perez C.A. de Mendoza D. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 175: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The accBC genes are located in an operon located at min 73.35 (3403.1 kb) of the E. coli MG1655 chromosome, a site distant from the carboxyltransferase subunit genes, accA (min 4.50) and accD (min 52.40). A number of unusual features are found in the DNA segment immediately upstream of the accBC operon; a long, non-translated leader region of 319 base pairs, a 98-bp sequence of bent DNA within this leader region, an unknown open reading frame of 188 bp, as well as a series of inverted repeats upstream of the accB initiation codon (10.Li S.J. Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Deletion analyses of these features, however, failed to show any regulatory roles for these features (10.Li S.J. Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We now report that transcription of the accBC operon is regulated by accumulation of AccB. Bacteria, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in minimal E salts supplemented with 0.2% glucose and vitamin-free casamino acids (Difco) when necessary. Optimal induction of the Plac and Ptac promoters was determined for each gene, but maximal expression was with 1 mm IPTG. Genes under control of the arabinose promoter were induced with 0.2% l-arabinose. Malonate supplementation was determined to be optimal for most strains at 2 mm. Greater concentrations of malonate were inhibitory to growth of MG1655 and other K-12 strains. Growth on malonate as a sole carbon source was conducted in minimal medium E plates supplemented with casamino acids (0.04%) and malonate at 2 mm. Malonate liquid medium was supplemented with 5% sucrose as an osmotic stabilizer.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids employedBacterial strainsGenotype or descriptionSource or ref.MG1655F- λ-ilvG- rfb-50 rph-1Coli GeneticStockCenterJH642Bacillus subtilis phe trpD.

Plasmid pESJ114 is an ampicillin-resistant plasmid that uses the pBR322 origin of replication and contains a truncated accB gene under control of the Plac promoter. A kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by terminator regions was inserted 204-bp downstream of the accB ATG resulting in expression of the first 68 amino acids of AccB and the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. This N-terminal portion of AccB lacks the biotinylation domain and failed to complement an accB mutation. Plasmid pESJ114 was maintained in a lacIq background to mitigate the toxicity of truncated gene expression. Plasmid pCY216 is a chloram-phenicol resistant pACYC origin plasmid carrying the BirA coding region under control of an arabinose promoter (12.Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCY335 is a kanamycin-resistant pBR322-origin plasmid carrying the coding region for the C-terminal 87 amino acids of AccB under control of the arabinose promoter. The C-terminal fragment encoded contains all the structural elements required for efficient biotinylation, but is unable to complement an accB mutant or function in vivo in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction (12.Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Plasmid pMATop-2 is pBluescript SK+ containing the matA, matB, and matC genes under their native promoter (14.Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10332-10336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pESJ297 is a pMATop-2 derivative in which the ampicillin gene was replaced with a gentamycin-resistance cassette from p34S-GM (13.Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2710-2715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The B. subtilis accB gene was cloned from strain JH642 using the polymerase chain reaction into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) resulting in pESJ207. Plasmid pESJ207 was restriction digested with KpnI and NotI and the accB fragment was ligated into the same sites of pPRO-Lar.A122 to give pESJ209. Plasmid pESJ225 encodes a chimeric AccB consisting of the N-terminal 44 amino acids of E. coli AccB fused to the C-terminal 109 residues of B. subtilis BCCP in vector pPROLar.A122 (Clontech). Plasmid pESJ315 encodes a chimeric AccB consisting of the N-terminal 47 amino acids of B. subtilis AccB and the C-terminal 109 amino acids of E. coli AccB in pPROLar.A122. The ability of pESJ225 and pESJ315 to provide active AccB was demonstrated by complementation of the accBts mutation of strain L8 at 42 °C. Strains for analysis of biotin operon activity include CY481, a derivative of BM4092 containing a wild-type birA gene (14.Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10332-10336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) plus a bioFZ::lacZ fusion and strain SA291, which contains a bio operon deletion extending from galK to moaA (15.Adhya S. Cleary P. Campbell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 956-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Strain ESJ298 is SA291 containing pMATop-2. Biotin supplementation at 41 nm was used to repress bio operon expression, and minimal biotin supplementation was conducted at 4 nm. E. coli strain L8 contains an accBts allele in which the encoded protein is unstable upon growth at 40 °C to 42 °C (16.Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (37364): 37355-37373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). pDEW201 is a Photorhabdus luminescens promoterless probe vector containing the luxCDABE genes necessary for light production in vivo in the absence of exogenously supplied substrates for luminescence (17.Van Dyk T.K.

Light emission from luciferase fusions was monitored with a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold Instruments) and is reported in the form of Relative Light Units. Protein Biotinylation Assay—Cultures were grown overnight in the presence of excess biotin (>40 nm) to completely repress the biotin biosynthetic operon. The cells were then washed three times in biotin-free medium and resuspended in medium containing d-[8–9-3H]biotin and allowed to grow. Metricel 0.45-μm filter disks (Millipore) were applied to a vacuum manifold, soaked in 0.1 mm biotin to reduce nonspecific biotin binding, and allowed to dry. The filters were then washed in 50% trichloroacetic acid and allowed to dry. Samples (0.1 ml) of the cultures was then pipetted onto the filter disk and followed immediately by 1 ml of 5% trichloroactic acid solution. The filters were then washed in 1 ml of absolute ethanol to remove free biotin, dried, and the resulting radioactivity counted in a Beckman scintillation counter. Northern Blotting—Northern blotting procedures were modified from those of Kornblum et al. (18.Kornblum J.S. Projan S.J. Moghazeh S.L. Novick R.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 63: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Between 5 and 10 μg of total RNA in a volume of ∼5 μl was added to a mixture of 2 μl of 5× MOPS buffer which consisted of 0.1 m MOPS, 40 mm sodium acetate, 5 mm EDTA pH 7.0), 3.5 μl of 37% (w/v) formaldehyde, and 10 μl of deionized ultrapure formamide (Sigma). This mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 15 min and placed on ice. RNA loading buffer (50% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% bromphenol blue, and 0.25% xylene cyanol FF) (2 μl) was then added. The RNA species were separated using 1.2% agarose gels prepared with MOPS buffer plus 1.8% formaldehyde, and electrophoresed in 10% MOPS, 2% formaldehyde at 5 V/cm for ∼3 h. Duplicate gels were run and stained with ethidium bromide to confirm the presence of sharp bands for the major ribosomal species. Transfer of RNA to positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Applied Science) was conducted using a BIOS transfer apparatus with 20× SSC as the transfer solution. Following overnight transfer, gels were stained with ethidium bromide to visually confirm efficient transfer of the ribosomal RNAs. RNA was fixed to the nylon membrane using a Fisher model FBUVXL-1000 UV-cross-linker for approximately 3 min. Northern blots were incubated in prehybridization solution consisting of 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50% deionized formamide, 5× SSC, 2% nonfat dry milk, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine at 50 °C for at least 2 h and generally overnight in a volume of 75 ml. The probes (15–25 ng/ml) were boiled for 10 min, placed on ice for 5 min, and added to 75 ml of prehybridization solution. Hybridization was generally conducted at 60 °C for at least 24 h. RNA Preparation—Culture samples were placed in microcentrifuge tubes, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 s, and the liquid was removed by aspiration. The cultures were then immediately flash-frozen in a dry ice-methanol bath. Alternatively, samples were added to 2 volumes of a tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide RNA stabilization reagent (RNAprotect Bacterial Reagent, Qiagen), incubated for 15 min, centrifuged, and the pellet flash-frozen in dry ice-methanol. The samples were then briefly thawed and the cells lysed by 1 mg/ml lysozyme in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) for 10 min. The RNA was then purified using nucleic acid binding columns according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Qiagen RNAeasy spin columns), and the RNA quantitated in duplicate by spectrophotometry. RNase-free DNase added to remove traces of DNA. Typical yields from 2 ml of actively growing E. coli cultures varied from 50 to 100 μg of total RNA. When very early phases of growth were assayed, 5–10 ml cultures were sampled. The RNA samples were prepared and quantitated immediately before use in Northern blotting to insure uniform loading. Northern Probe Construction and Signal Detection—In general, for PCR-amplifying genomic sequences to be used as probes in nucleic acid analysis E. coli strain MG1655 was used as a template. Bacterial colonies were taken from agar plates and used directly in standard PCR reactions with no further purification. To detect the accBC transcript, primers AccCmRNA left and AccCmRNA right (Table I) were used to PCR amplify a 663-bp fragment internal to the accC gene, ∼250-bp downstream of the accC initiation codon. This fragment was subsequently labeled by incorporation of DIG-labeled nucleotides using a random priming method in conjunction with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment and quantitated before use in Northern blots (Roche Applied Science). A probe specific to the accB coding region was generated by restriction digestion of plasmid pESJ89 with HindIII and KpnI to generate a 264-bp fragment carrying a portion internal to the accB gene. Following purification the fragment was labeled using the replacement synthesis reaction in conjunction with Klenow fragment. To detect mRNA in the accBC promoter region, a segment of DNA that began in the accBC promoter region and extended to 10-bp upstream of the accB ATG was amplified using primers bccpupstleft and bccpupstright (Table II).

Following hybridization with the DIG-labeled probe and post-hybridization washes, anti-DIG-AP antibodies were incubated with either CDP or CDP-Star according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Applied Science) and the resulting light-producing reaction monitored using x-ray film autoradiography. Construction of Genomic Replacements and Deletions—Genomic replacements were conducted using the methods of Yu et al. (19.Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) and Datsenko and Wanner (20.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). The use of the defective λ prophage as a source of λred recombinase (19.Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) had a much higher efficiency than the plasmid-encoded recombinase functions, such as pKD46 and pKD20 (20.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). The method of generating genomic insertions was essentially that described (20.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar), with the exception of inducing recombinase expression in pKD46 for 12–24 h and growth of the transformants at room temperature, which increased the number of recombinant clones considerably. To remove the chromosomal FRT-flanked antibiotic resistance cassettes plasmid pCP20 was used according to the method of Datsenko and Wanner (20.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). The primers used for the accA kanamycin cassette insertion are accA::kan left accA::kan right. The primers used to delete accB were accBinsertionleft and accbinsertionright. To replace the endogenous accBC promoter with the lacZYA promoter, a plasmid was constructed consisting of the lacZYA promoter from strain MG1655 inserted downstream of the kanamycin resistance cassette of pKD13 (19.Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). This construct was used as a template for PCR using primers Plac::accbcRevand Plac::accbcRev. The resulting PCR product was recombined into the chromosome using the method of Yu et al. (19.Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). This resulted in the Plac promoter initiating transcription at the same position (297-bp upstream of the accB initiation codon) as the wild-type accBC promoter. After PCR confirmation, Western blotting demonstrated an IPTG dependent increase in AccB production in this strain (data not shown). Overproduction of AccB Results in Decreased accBC Operon Transcription—Our first indication that AccB might play a role in transcription of the accBC operon was that growth was severely inhibited upon expression of accB from the lac promoter of a multicopy plasmid pLS24 (21.Li S.J. Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, if accB and accC were cotranscribed from the same vector growth proceeded normally. It therefore seemed possible that overexpression of AccB might down-regulate expression of the chromosomal accBC operon thereby resulting in an AccC deficiency. Our earliest studies used a plasmid carrying a transcriptional fusion construct consisting of the promoter region upstream of accBC fused to the luxABCDE genes of plasmid pDEW201 (17.Van Dyk T.K. Majarian W.R. Konstantinov K.B. Young R.M. Dhurjati P.S. LaRossa R.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overproduction of AccB from a second plasmid resulted in decreased expression of luciferase (Fig. 1), a result consistent with a regulatory role for AccB. In subsequent experiments Northern blotting was used to determine the levels of the chromosomally encoded accBC transcript in the presence or absence of AccB overproduction. This allowed regulation to be examined in a more physiological context and avoided the complications introduced by use of a multicopy reporter. The chromosomal accBC transcript was monitored independently of the plasmid-encoded accB transcript by use of a probe with homology only to the accC gene portion of the message. Previous analyses of accBC transcription showed no evidence of any RNA processing events that could lead to differential transcription of the accBC transcript (21.Li S.J. Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, probing for accC mRNA provides a valid representation of transcription of the entire operon. Several cell doublings were required before growth inhibition upon accB overexpression from plasmid pESJ89 was observed. Therefore, upon induction of increased accB expression in early- to mid-exponential cultures, growth continued unabated with only a slight reduction in final cell densities. To separate overall growth effects from any specific consequences of AccB overproduction on accBC operon transcription, cultures were grown to early log phase in glucose containing medium (glucose was included to aid repression of the lac promoter). The cells were then collected, washed, and resuspended in medium containing either glucose or IPTG. Upon resumption of growth the levels of chromosomal accBC transcripts were analyzed by Northern blotting of RNA samples taken over the course of the experiment (Fig. 2). In cultures where accB expression was repressed by addition of glucose, accBC operon transcription remained constant throughout the time course (although transcription began to diminish slightly after 2 h as growth slowed due to the onset of stationary phase). In contrast induction of increased accB expression had a dramatic and rapid effect on accBC transcription (Fig. 2A). Densitometric quantitation of accBC transcript levels showed that elevated levels of AccB resulted in a 50% decrease in transcript levels within 30 min after induction, falling to 10% of uninduced levels by 40 min after induction. The inhibition of accBC transcription was specific to AccB overexpression in that overexpression of the accA, accD, and accC gene products had no effect on accBC operon transcript levels (Fig. 2B). Incorporation of d-[8–9-3H]biotin showed that AccB expression from plasmid pESJ89 resulted in a 4-fold increase in the rate of AccB production relative to uninduced cultures. Therefore, only a modest overexpression of AccB was needed to trigger the decrease in transcri"
https://openalex.org/W1985645100,"Cytochrome P-450 1A1 (CYP1A1) is known to be induced by aromatic hydrocarbons, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). We found that p38 MAP kinase inhibitors (SB203580 and SB202190; 40 μm each; pyridinyl imidazole compounds) suppressed CYP1A1-mRNA induction by TCDD (2 nm) in mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 cells and in human hepatoma HepG2 cells, and also suppressed CYP1B1-mRNA induction by TCDD (2 nm) in human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cells. An analogue compound, SB202474, which does not inhibit p38 MAP kinase, also suppressed CYP1A1-mRNA induction by TCDD. Moreover, overexpression of a dominant-negative gene for p38 MAP kinase in Hepa-1 cells did not suppress Cyp1a1 reporter gene induction by TCDD. Therefore, the suppression of Cyp1a1 transcription by pyridinyl imidazole compounds is not because of their inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity. Because SB203580 did not inhibit in vitro AhR transformation by TCDD, this compound was not acting as a simple AhR antagonist. SB203580 decreased TCDD-induced histone acetylation levels in the region of the Cyp1a1 gene promoter, especially around the TATA box sequence. This result suggests the possibility that pyridinyl imidazole compounds suppress the recruitment of some co-activator that has the histone acetyltransferase activity necessary for CYP1A1-mRNA transcription.

Immunosuppression, tumor promotion, and teratogenesis are well known toxic effects of these compounds in vertebrates (1Kikuchi H. Shibazaki M. Ahmed S. Baba T. Chemosphere. 2001; 43: 815-818Google Scholar, 2Hossain A. Tsuchiya S. Minegishi M. Osada M. Ikawa S. Tezuka F.A. Kaji M. Konno T. Watanabe M. Kikuchi H. J. Biol.

Toxicol. 1994; 34: 343-372Google Scholar).The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated cytosolic protein that is a member of the family of the basic-helix-loop-helix-Per/ARNT/Sim transcription factors, and it regulates the induction of the Cyp1a1 gene (5Okey A.B. Riddick D.S. Harper P.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 226-232Google Scholar). In the unstimulated state, AhR forms a complex with two molecules of heat shock protein 90 and the immunophilin homologue protein, XAP-2 (6LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6153-6159Google Scholar, 7Petrulis J.R. Kusnadi A. Ramadoss P. Hollingshead B. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2677-2685Google Scholar). When ligand (for example, TCDD) binds to the ligand-binding domain of AhR, a chaperone protein is dissociated from the complex, and AhR can then translocate into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, AhR forms a heterodimer with AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT), and recognizes its target sequence, a xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) was found upstream of the CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, and NQO1 genes (5Okey A.B. Riddick D.S. Harper P.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 226-232Google Scholar, 8Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Pharmacogenetics. 1993; 3: 213-230Google Scholar). The involvement of AhR in cytotoxicity is evidenced by AhR-null mice being resistant to the toxic effects of TCDD and other aromatic hydrocarbons (9Shimizu Y. Nakatsuru Y. Ichinose M. Takahashi Y. Kume H. Mimura J. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ishikawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 779-782Google Scholar). Because AhR is a central molecule in the action process of TCDD toxicity, the induction of cytochrome P-450 1A1 (CYP1A1) has been used as a model system for the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of TCDD.The induction of CYP1A1 by TCDD is suppressed by pretreatment of immune cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-1, or tumor necrosis factor (10Tian Y. Ke S. Denison M.S. Rabson A.B. Gallo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 510-515Google Scholar, 11Ke S. Rabson A.B. Germino J.F. Gallo M.A. Tian Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39638-39644Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in the intracellular signaling cascades induced by LPS have been analyzed in detail, and are known to induce activation of the MAP kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, JNKs, p38s) pathway through its membrane-bound receptor, Toll-like receptor (12Guha M. Mackman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Google Scholar). LPS also activates the NF-κB pathway. Tian and co-workers (10Tian Y. Ke S. Denison M.S. Rabson A.B. Gallo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 510-515Google Scholar) showed that activated AhR can interact with NF-κB subunit p65 (RelA), and that this interaction results in a suppression of the transcription of its target gene. Introduction of the oncogene ras into cultured human breast cancer cells suppresses the transcriptional activation by TCDD of several members of the AhR battery of genes (13Reiners Jr., J.J. Jones C.L. Hong N. Clift R.E. Elferink C. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 91-100Google Scholar). Puga and co-workers (14Puga A. Barnes S.J. Chang C. Zhu H. Nephew K.P. Khan S.A. Shertzer H.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 997-1005Google Scholar) showed that TCDD treatment induced a transient activation of transcription factors, especially AP-1, in Hepa-1 cells, and that this activation was AhR-dependent (14Puga A. Barnes S.J. Chang C. Zhu H. Nephew K.P. Khan S.A. Shertzer H.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 997-1005Google Scholar). They also reported that TCDD affected the expression level of various genes, including those for members of Ras/MAPK-related signaling pathways in HepG2 cells (15Puga A. Maier A. Medvedovic M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1129-1142Google Scholar). These data suggest that the AhR pathway and the MAP kinase pathway may cross-talk with each other, but the detailed mechanism remains controversial (for example, how LPS suppresses CYP1A1 and the extent of the contribution of the MAP kinase pathway to induction by TCDD).In the light of the background described above, we decided to focus on the p38 MAP kinase pathway, which is strongly activated by LPS through its Toll-like receptor 4, to assess its involvement in the inhibition of CYP1A1 by LPS. The MAP kinase pathway of p38 ultimately activates transcription factor ATF-2, and regulates the transcription of target genes by binding to its regulatory sequence, AP-1 (12Guha M. Mackman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Google Scholar). This cascade can be blocked by a series of pyridinyl imidazole compounds, exemplified by SB203580, which were originally identified by their ability to suppress the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines (16Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar). In the course of experiments with such chemical inhibitors, we found that CYP1A1-mRNA induction by TCDD was potently suppressed by pre-treatment of Hepa-1 cells with pyridinyl imidazole compounds.In this paper, we describe possible mechanisms by which pyridinyl imidazole compounds may suppress CYP1A1-mRNA induction by TCDD. Our data suggest that these widely used p38 MAP kinase-specific inhibitors may have another target molecule(s), besides p38 MAP kinase.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—HepG2 (HB 8065) and MCF7 (HTB 22) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The Hepa-1 cell line, derived from mouse hepatoma, was kindly provided by Dr. K. Sogawa (Tohoku University). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin G in humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The toxicities of all the inhibitors were tested by examining their effects on the growth rate of Hepa-1 cells, and the chemicals were used within the range of nontoxic doses (in terms of cell viability).Chemicals—TCDD was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Cambridge, MA). SB203580 (99.8% purity) was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI), and SB202474 (99.6% purity) and SB202190 (99.1% purity) from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA). α-Naphthoflavone and trichostatin A (TSA) were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), and omeprazole from LTK Laboratories, Inc. (St. Paul, MN). Labeled compound [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences.Plasmid Construction and Transfection into Cells—The 5′ upstream sequence (from -1642 bp to +57 bp) of the Cyp1a1 gene was provided by Dr. Daniel W. Nebert (University of Cincinnati Medical Center) (17Gonzalez F.J. Nebert D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7269-7288Google Scholar). The isolated fragment was ligated into pGL3-Basic (Promega). The wild-type p38 MAP kinase, dominant-negative p38 (both pCMV-Flag-p38MAPK, TGY and AGF), and the dominant-negative vectors of MKK3 and MKK6, were provided by Dr. Roger J. Davis (University of Massachusetts Medical School) (18Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Google Scholar, 19Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Google Scholar). The constitutively activated MKK6 was produced by replacing Ser-207 and Thr-211 with Glu using the PCR procedure (19Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Google Scholar). The activity of the Gal4 DNA binding domain, GAL4/ATF2 (20Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar), was measured in a cotransfection assay with the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transfection of plasmid DNA into cells was performed by the lipofection method using FuGENE6 (Roche Diagnostics, Japan). Transfection efficiency was normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity, which was produced by co-transfection of pCAGGS-lacZ (provided by Dr. J. Miyazaki, Osaka University Medical School) (21Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Google Scholar).The cells were harvested 22 h after transfection with expression plasmid, then lysed by a two times freeze-thaw in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The cleared lysate obtained by centrifugation was saved, and luciferase activity was measured in 10 μl of the sample using a Fluoroscan ASCENT FL (Labosystems, Finland).RNA Extraction and Northern Hybridization—Total RNA was extracted from cells by the acid guanidine phenol-chloroform extraction method (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Then, 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gel for 2 h at 80 V, and blotted on Hybond N+ (Amersham Biosciences) using 20× SSC overnight. The coding region of the Cyp1a1-cDNA fragment (1.7 kb) was used for the hybridization probe. A fragment of β-actin cDNA (398 bp) was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using 5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC-3′ and 5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3′ primers, and used as an endogenous control. The hybridization probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Prime-It (Stratagene), and purified on a Sephadex G-50 DNA-grade column (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was pre-hybridized with pre-hybridization buffer for 4 h at 68 °C, and then hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe (1 × 106 cpm/ml) using hybridization buffer overnight (more than 16 h) at 68 °C. Then, the membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC containing 0.5% SDS for 20 min. Signal was detected and quantified using a Bioimage analyzer BAS2000 (Fujifilm Co., Tokyo, Japan).Cytosolic Protein Preparation—Livers were removed from 6-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, and homogenized with ice-cold HEDG buffer (25 mm K+-HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor (Complete™; Roche Diagnostics)) using 3 ml of buffer for 1 g of liver, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 105,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and this supernatant fraction (cytosolic protein) was used in the experiments involving an in vitro transformation assay (23Harper P.A. Giannone J.V. Okey A.B. Denison M.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 603-612Google Scholar).Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Rat XRE oligomers (5′-GATCCGGCTCTTCTCACGCAACTCCGAGCTCA-3′ and 5′-GATCTGAGCCTGGAGTTGCGTGAGAAGAGCC-3′, with underlining representing the XRE core sequence) (24Fujisawa-Sehara A. Yamane M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5859-5863Google Scholar) were annealed and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by means of Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Then, the 32P-labeled XRE was purified on a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Amersham Biosciences). In the experiment involving in vitro transformation of rat cytosolic protein, 800 μg of protein was incubated with 10 nm TCDD, either alone or together with 20-160 μm SB203580 or 40 μm PD98059, for 3 h at 22 °C. One-tenth of the incubated protein (80 μg protein) was then incubated for 20 min at 22 °C with 225 ng of poly(dI-dC) containing 95 mm NaCl and 1× protease inhibitor (Complete™; Roche Diagnostics) in HEDG buffer in a total volume of 25 μl (23Harper P.A. Giannone J.V. Okey A.B. Denison M.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 603-612Google Scholar), followed by the addition of 1 ng of 32P-labeled XRE oligonucleotide (∼200,000 cpm). Then, the sample was incubated for an additional 20 min at 22 °C. To confirm the specific binding of XRE to AhR, a 250 times excess concentration of cold XRE was added. Then, samples were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide in 0.5× TBE buffer for 90 min at 150 V. After the gel had been dried, the radioactive signal was detected and quantified using a Bioimage analyzer, BAS2000.Western Blotting—Cells were transfected with expression vector, incubated for 48 h, then extracted with 50 μl of cell lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm NaCl, 1× protease inhibitor (Complete™; Roche Diagnostics), 1 mm dithiothreitol). Protein (50 μg) was electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was immunostained with anti-FLAG antibody (1000-fold dilution), and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was carried out essentially by the method of Wang and Hankinson (25Wang S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11821-11827Google Scholar). Hepa-1 cells were grown to 80% confluence in two plates in a 10-cm dish. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (-), cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min, then collected using a cell scraper. They were then rinsed twice with ice-cold washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline(-), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin), suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1× protease inhibitor (Complete™; Roche Diagnostics)), and incubated on ice for 10 min. Then, the cell suspension was sonicated for 15 s using a Branson sonifier (model W185 with micro-probe) at power setting 4, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, so that the DNA fragment size was 200-600 bp. Supernatant (120 μl) was collected and diluted in ChIP dilution buffer (1080 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor (Complete™; Roche Diagnostics)) followed by immunoclearing with 2.5 μg of shared salmon sperm DNA and Protein A buffer (60 μl of 50% slurry Protein A-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) in ChIP dilution buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed for 16 h at 4 °C with 6 μl (200-fold dilution) of anti-acetylated histone H4 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA) or anti-AhR antibody (SA-210; BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA). After immunoprecipitation, 60 μl of Protein A buffer was added, and the incubation was continued for another 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed sequentially in low-salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100), high-salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100), and LiCl detergent buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA). Precipitates were then washed twice in TE buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and extracted with 500 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Eluates were pooled and incubated at 65 °C for 12 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. After incubation for 1 h at 45 °C with 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 20 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 2 μl of Proteinase A (10 mg/ml), DNA fragments were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, and precipitated using 2 volumes of ethanol. Precipitates were then suspended in 20 μl of TE buffer. For PCR, a 1-μl sample from a 20-μl DNA extraction was used, with 30 cycles of amplification. For detection of the Cyp1a1 TATA box (-285 to +66), the primers used were 5′-TTTCCTCAAACCCCTCCCTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGTGAAGAGTGTTCTCTAGGAC-3′ (11Ke S. Rabson A.B. Germino J.F. Gallo M.A. Tian Y. J. Biol.

Fig. 2 shows the results of Northern hybridization. Pretreatment with SB203580 for 1 h before the addition of 2 nm TCDD significantly suppressed CYP1A1-mRNA induction by TCDD in a dose-dependent manner in both Hepa-1 cells and HepG2 cells (Fig. 2, A and C). Generally, around 10 μm SB203580 is used for the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity. At such a dose, about a 50% suppression of CYP1A1-mRNA induction was observed. At 40 μm SB203580, suppression was by about 75-90%. This suppression was confirmed at a higher dose (20 nm) of TCDD (Fig. 2B). Induction of the mRNA for another AhR battery gene, CYP1B1, was also suppressed by SB203580 (Fig. 2D). On treatment of the cells with SB203580 alone, no CYP1A1-mRNA induction was detected in any of the cultured cells. At a concentration of 80 μm, SB203580 had no effect on cell survival or viability, as assessed using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (data not shown).Fig. 2Effects of the p38 MAP kinase inhibitors on TCDD-induced CYP1A1- and CYP1B1-mRNAs.A and C, dose-dependent effect of SB203580 (SB) on the induction of CYP1A1-mRNA by TCDD. Hepa-1 (A) or HepG2 (C) cells were pretreated with various doses of SB203580 for 1 h before the addition of 2 nm TCDD. B, dose-dependent effect of TCDD on CYP1A1-mRNA, and its suppression by SB203580. Hepa-1 cells were pretreated with 40 μm SB203580 for 1 h before the addition of various doses of TCDD. D, effect of SB203580 on the induction of CYP1B1-mRNA by TCDD. MCF7 cells were pretreated with 40 μm SB203580 or 10 μm PD98059 (PD) for 1 h before the addition of 2 nm TCDD or solvent (DMSO). The membrane was hybridized with a CYP1B1-mRNA specific probe. In all experiments, cells were harvested 22 h after TCDD treatment. E, effect of SB202474 and SB202190 on CYP1A1 induction. Hepa-1 cells were pretreated with various doses of SB202474 and SB202190, analogues of pyridinyl imidazole, for 1 h before the addition of 2 nm TCDD. After incubation with TCDD for 22 h, cells were harvested, and Northern hybridization was performed using a Cyp1a1-cDNA probe. Upper panel of A shows quantification of the CYP1A1-mRNA signal using a Bioimage analyzer, BAS-2000 (Fujifilm Co.). Each data point indicates the mean from three independent experiments, with the bar showing the standard deviation. The intensity of CYP1A1-mRNA was normalized with respect to that of β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)SB203580 Suppresses CYP1A1-mRNA Induction by TCDD at the Level of Transcription—AhR recognizes the XRE sequence in the regulatory region upstream of the Cyp1a1 gene. Next, we examined whether the above suppression is exerted at the transcriptional level, using a luciferase reporter gene inserted into the regulatory region of the Cyp1a1 gene (-1642 bp to +57 bp) in a pGL3 Basic vector (Fig. 3A). Treatment with 2 nm TCDD induced about a 7-fold increase in luciferase activity in transfected Hepa-1 cells. On the other hand, in an experiment involving pretreatment with various doses of SB203580 1 h before the addition of 2 nm TCDD, a significant dose-dependent suppression of luciferase activity was observed (Fig. 3B). This trend was in good agreement with the results of Northern hybridization (Fig. 2). This result implied that SB203580 suppressed the transcription of the Cyp1a1 gene, rather than inhibiting of CYP1A1-mRNA degradation.Fig. 3Suppression of Cyp1a1 reporter gene by SB203580. Hepa-1 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of a reporter gene, the Cyp1a1-promoter region (-1642 to +57) ligated with pGL3Basic vector, together with 0.2 μg of pCAGGS-lacZ vector. After 16 h incubation, cells were treated with various doses of SB203580 for 1 h before the addition of 2 nm TCDD. Cells were incubated for a further 22 h, then harvested and luciferase activity was measured. Luciferase activity was normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity.

The IC50 concentration of SB203580 for p38 MAP kinase is below 1 μm and that of SB202190 is below 0.5 μm, whereas SB202474, which has no ability to inhibit p38 MAP kinase activity, is generally used as a negative control compound in p38 MAP kinase studies (16Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar). The effects of these compounds on CYP1A1-mRNA induction by TCDD were tested by Northern hybridization (Fig. 2E). SB202190 and SB202474, analogues of the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580, suppressed CYP1A1-mRNA induction by TCDD in the same way as SB203580 itself (lanes 3-16). Furthermore, it shows that this effect is not because of inhibition of the p38 MAP kinase activity, because SB202474, which does not inhibit p38 MAP kinase activity at all, suppressed CYP1A1-mRNA induction by TCDD (lanes 6-8).The p38 MAP Kinase Pathway Is Not Involved in the Induction of CYP1A1-mRNA by TCDD—To evaluate the contribution made by the p38 MAP kinase pathway to the induction of CYP1A1-mRNA by TCDD, we used dominant-negative constructs of p38 MAP kinases. MKK3 and MKK6 are upstream molecules of p38 MAP kinase. MKK3/6 dominant-negative constructs were transfected into Hepa-1 cells, and their effects were assessed on the activation of the Cyp1a1 reporter gene by TCDD (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4A, no significant suppression of reporter gene expression was observed with any combination. Furthermore, a p38 MAP kinase dominant-negative construct was also tested in the same way as MKK3/6 (Tables I). The “-fold induction” (that is, the luciferase activity of the reporter gene in the presence of TCDD divided by that in the absence of TCDD) was not significantly different between the wild-type p38 MAP kinase and the dominant-negative p38 MAP kinase construct at 2 μg of plasmid DNA. The inhibitory function of dominant negative p38 MAP kinase in Hepa-1 cells was confirmed using the constitutively activated MKK6 and ATF-2 systems (Table II) (19Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Google Scholar). The left and right panels in Fig. 4B show the expression levels (detected by Western blotting) of the dominant-negative constructs for MKK3/6 and p38 MAP kinase, respectively. These results, like those described above, imply that the p38 MAP kinase pathway is not involved in the induction of CYP1A1-mRNA by TCDD.Fig. 4Effect of MKK3/6 or p38 MAPK dominant-negative constructs on TCDD-induced Cyp1a1 reporter gene activity.A, Hepa-1 cells were transfected with MKK3 or MKK6 dominant-negative constructs (MKK3-D.N. or MKK6-D.N.) together with 0.5 μg of Cyp1a1 reporter gene and 0.2 μg of pCAGGS-lacZ. Then, 16 h after transfection cells were treated for 22 h with 2 nm TCDD. Cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured. Luciferase activity was normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity. B, the expression levels of transfected MKK3-D.N. and MKK6-D.N. (left panel) and p38 MAPK-D.N.

Reiners and co-workers (26Reiners Jr., J.J. Lee J.Y. Clift R.E. Dudley D.T. Myrand S.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 438-445Google Scholar) revealed that this suppression was because of an antagonistic effect of PD98059 on AhR. This compound strongly suppresses in vitro AhR transformation by TCDD. We performed an in vitro AhR transformation assay using SB203580, with PD98059 as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 5 (lane 3) a rat cytosolic AhR activated by 10 nm TCDD formed a complex with a 32P-labeled XRE sequence, and the complex formation was completely suppressed by the addition of a 200 times excess of cold XRE (lane 2). Co-incubation with PD98059 completely inhibited AhR activation by TCDD (lane 13), but co-incubation with SB203580 did not (lanes 8-11).

https://openalex.org/W2026091472,"The cyclooxygenase (COX) reaction of prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis begins with the highly specific oxygenation of arachidonic acid in the 11R configuration and ends with a 15S oxygenation to form PGG2. To obtain new insights into the mechanisms of stereocontrol of oxygenation, we mutated active site residues of human COX-2 that have potential contacts with C-11 of the reacting substrate. Although the 11R oxygenation was not perturbed, changing Leu-384 (into Phe, Trp), Trp-387 (Phe, Tyr), Phe-518 (Ile, Trp, Tyr), and Gly-526 (Ala, Ser, Thr, Val) impaired or abrogated PGG2 synthesis, and typically 11R-HETE was the main product formed. The Gly-526 and Leu-384 mutants formed, in addition, three novel products identified by LC-MS, NMR, and circular dichroism as 8,9-11,12-diepoxy-13R-(or 15R)-hydro(pero)xy derivatives of arachidonic acid. Mechanistically, we propose these arise from a free radical intermediate in which a C-8 carbon radical displaces the 9,11-endoperoxide O-O bond to yield an 8,9-11,12-diepoxide that is finally oxygenated stereospecifically in the 13R or 15R configuration. Formation of these novel products signals an arrest in the normal course of prostaglandin synthesis just prior to closing of the 5-membered carbon ring, and points to a crucial role for Leu-384 and Gly-526 in the correct positioning of the reacting fatty acid intermediate. Some of the Gly-526 and Leu-384 mutants catalyzed both formation of PGG2 (with the normal 15S configuration) and the 13R- or 15R-oxygenated diepoxides.

These by-products are formed at the two positions on arachidonic acid that are normally oxygenated during the transformation to prostaglandins. At the separate peroxidase site on the enzyme, PGG2 is ultimately reduced to its 15-hydroxy analog, PGH2, and similarly, the HPETEs to their hydroxyl analogs, HETEs. The order of the individual steps in the main reaction is well understood. What is not so well understood is the structural or mechanistic basis for the exquisite control of stereochemistry throughout the process.

Nonetheless, as a result of all these studies a substantial body of data has accumulated on the effects of mutations on the profile of oxygenated products (14Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Rieke J.C. Sun Y. Wingerd B.A. Micielli R. Mulichak A.M. Malkowski M.G. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10347-10357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). One remarkable conclusion stemming from these mutagenesis experiments is how well the enzyme can tolerate mutations and still maintain synthesis of the normal prostaglandin stereochemistry. The typical consequence of mutations, if they alter the products, is to increase the proportion of one or other of the HPETE by-products; at the same time, any PG endoperoxide formed is PGG2 with the usual stereochemistry. An exception to this rule, that the process of PG synthesis remains unaffected, is our recent report that small but specific changes to residues surrounding C15 of arachidonic acid in the COX active site could invert the configuration of the 15-hydroperoxy group of PGG2 from 15S in wild-type to 15R in mutant COX enzymes (15Schneider C.

Of the two residues identified, Ser-530, 2The numbering of amino acid residues is according to the sequence of ovine COX-1.2The numbering of amino acid residues is according to the sequence of ovine COX-1. the target of acetylation by aspirin, had the more crucial role in preserving the usual 15S stereochemistry. Its replacement with the larger residues methionine, valine, or threonine led to formation of a prostaglandin product that was 82-95% of the 15R configuration. The second residue identified, Val-349, upon specific mutation only to isoleucine led to a 40 or 60-65% inversion of the C15 configuration in COX-1 and COX-2, respectively (15Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Prusakiewicz J.J. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. Samel N. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).With this precedent in mind, the initial objective of the studies reported here was to identify active site residues involved in stereocontrol of the initial oxygenation at C11. Five amino acids were selected for mutation based on their proximity to C11 of arachidonic acid as it appears when bound in the active site of the COX-1 isozyme (11Malkowski M.G. Ginell S.L. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Although several of these amino acids have been targeted previously for mutation, the effects on product stereochemistry have not been reported. The approximate location of the five selected residues in relation to the bound arachidonic acid is depicted in schematic form in Fig. 1 (encircled residues). According to the previous findings on stereocontrol at C15 we hypothesized that either increasing space or constricting space around C11 of arachidonic acid would lead to partial or even complete inversion of the oxygenation from the wild-type 11R to the 11S configuration. As noted earlier, 11R-HETE is a regular by-product during the COX reaction. It is thought to arise from a conformation of arachidonic acid bound in the active site that is slightly different from the conformation necessary to yield PGG2 (21Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8501-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Whether PGG2 or 11-HETE is the product, the oxygenation always occurs with high stereospecificity in the 11R-configuration (7Hecker M. Ullrich V. Fischer C. Meese C.O. Eur. J.

As reported here, our attempts to date to influence the stereocontrol at C11 have met with the same extraordinary resistance of the COX enzyme to producing anything other than the natural 11R oxygenation. In the course of these mutagenesis experiments, nevertheless, we identified two residues in the COX-2 active site that, upon mutation, arrest prostaglandin ring cyclization after formation of the 9,11-endoperoxide, and instead complete the catalytic cycle by formation of three novel diepoxyalcohol derivatives of arachidonic acid. Despite the arrest in cyclopentane ring formation, synthesis of these products is completed in the COX active site by a second highly specific oxygenation on the carbon chain at either C13 or C15.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration and Expression of Mutant COX-2 Enzymes—Mutant enzymes were prepared using human COX-2 cDNA in the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) and appropriate oligos in the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) essentially as described before (15Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Prusakiewicz J.J. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. Samel N. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All mutants and wild-type COX-2 were transiently transfected into HeLa cells together with co-transfection of a recombinant virus containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene (23Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).The G526S mutant and wild-type COX-2 were also prepared in the pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector (BD Biosciences) and expressed in Sf9 insect cells. The human COX-2 cDNA used for this expression system contained a His6 tag located after the signal cleavage site and was kindly provided by Dr. David DeWitt, Michigan State University (24Smith T. Leipprandt J. DeWitt D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At 72-h post-viral infection, Sf9 cells were pelleted by centrifugation and disrupted by freeze-thaw lysis. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of resuspension buffer consisting of 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm diethyldithiocarbamate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μl of protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C the pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of the same buffer and passed through a glass homogenizer several times. While stirring at 4 °C, an 11% solution of CHAPS was added dropwise to the homogenate to a final concentration of 1%, and stirring was continued for an additional 2 h. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C the supernatant was mixed overnight with 2 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), pre-equilibrated in the resuspension buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The slurry was poured into a column support and washed twice with 5 ml of the resuspension buffer each containing 0.5% CHAPS and 20 mm or 50 mm imidazole, respectively. The COX-2 protein was eluted with 10 ml of the washing buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. Fractions of 2 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Imidazole was removed by dialysis of the pooled fractions (typically the first two fractions) against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% CHAPS. This purification protocol yielded >85% pure protein as estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis. The final concentration of the enzyme preparations was 1.6 μg/μl (23 μm) for wild-type and 2.7 μg/μl (39 μm) for G526S COX-2.Incubations and Extraction of Products—HeLa cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated on ice in incubation buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm phenol, pH 8.0). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford protein assay (BioRad). To determine the relative conversion of arachidonic acid by wild-type and mutant COX-2, equal amounts of cells in 100 μl incubation buffer were reacted with 50 μm [14C]arachidonic acid for 10 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 μm hematin. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 250 μl of methanol and 125 μl of methylene chloride. After centrifugation the supernatant was removed and evaporated from the organic solvents, dissolved in 50 μl of methanol and 900 μl of 0.1% acetic acid. The samples were loaded onto preconditioned 100 mg Oasis HLB cartridges (Waters). After washing with water, products and unreacted substrate were eluted using 1 ml of methanol.Large scale incubations of purified G526S COX-2 from the baculovirus expression system were conducted in 10 parallel reactions. Each reaction consisted of 2 ml of incubation buffer containing 1 μm hematin and 50 μl of 39 μm G526S COX-2. Reactions were started by addition of 50 μg of arachidonic acid dissolved in 10 μl of ethanol. To one of the reactions 3 × 106 cpm [14C]arachidonic acid were added additionally. After 10 min at room temperature, the reactions were terminated by addition of 200 μl of methanol and 16 μl of glacial acetic acid. Each reaction was loaded immediately onto a preconditioned 100 mg Oasis HLB cartridge (Waters), washed with water, and products and substrate were eluted with 1 ml of methanol. In some of the experiments the pooled eluates were treated with 0.2 mg/0.5 ml triphenylphosphine.Product Analyses—Products extracted from HeLa cell incubations were analyzed by RP-HPLC using a Waters Symmetry C18 5-μm column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a stepwise gradient of the solvents: acetonitrile/water/acetic acid 37.5:62.5:0.01 (by volume) for 15 min, then acetonitrile/water/acetic acid 70:30:0.01 (by volume) for 15 min, and finally with methanol. Prior to HPLC analysis unlabeled standards of HETEs (0.2 μg each) and PGE2 (2 μg) were added to facilitate UV-detection of the peaks. Chromatography was monitored using an Agilent 1100 series diode array detector coupled on-line to a Packard A140 Radiomatic liquid scintillation counter. Initially, only 20% aliquots of the samples were analyzed by RP-HPLC to monitor the product profile. For chiral analysis of PGE2 and 11-HETE the remaining 80% of each sample were injected in a second RP-HPLC run under identical conditions. Products were collected and further analyzed using SP-HPLC and chiral phase HPLC as described (15Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Prusakiewicz J.J. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. Samel N. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).The products formed by the purified G526S mutant COX-2 were analyzed and isolated by RP-HPLC using a Waters Symmetry C18 5-μm column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted with a solvent of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid 50:50:0.01 (by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After 15 min, the solvent was changed to methanol to elute 11-HETE and unreacted arachidonic acid. Chromatography was monitored using the diode array detector coupled on-line to the liquid scintillation detector. Following reduction with triphenylphosphine, two peaks were collected from RP-HPLC with retention times of ≈10 min and ≈13 min, extracted using methylene chloride, and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. SP-HPLC of the early eluting peak gave a single peak at retention time 26.5 min using a Beckman Ultrasphere Si 5-μm column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted with a solvent of hexane/isopropyl alcohol/acetic acid 100:5:0.1 (by volume) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The second peak from RP-HPLC was either methylated using ethereal diazomethane or chromatographed without methylation. Diazomethane was prepared using the Aldrich generator (www.sigmaaldrich.com/Brands/Aldrich/Technical Bulletins.html). Using identical SP-HPLC conditions as above, the second RP-HPLC peak (after methylation) resolved into two products with retention times of ≈18 and ≈21 min.Kinetic Analyses—Rates of reaction of wild-type and G526S COX-2 enzymes were determined from oxygen consumption. A Clark-type oxygen electrode was used. The reactions contained 2 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm phenol, pH 8.0 supplemented with 1 μm hematin maintained at 27 °C. Wild-type and mutant enzyme was added at a final concentration of 0.12 μm in the assays (16 μg of protein). The reaction was initiated by addition of 100 μm arachidonic acid, and oxygen uptake was monitored for 5 min. Rates were calculated from the slope of the linear curve over the first 15-30 s, and assuming an initial oxygen concentration of 240 μm in the buffer.LC-ESI-MS and NMR—For LC-ESI-MS analyses a Thermo Finnigan LC Quantum system was used. Samples isolated by SP-HPLC were introduced via a Waters Symmetry C18 3-μm column (0.2 × 10 cm) eluted with a water/acetonitrile gradient containing 10 mm ammonium acetate at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The heated capillary ion lens was operated at 220 °C. Nitrogen was used as a nebulization and desolvation gas. The electrospray potential was held at 4 kV. Mass spectra were acquired over the mass range m/z 100-1,000 at 2 s/scan.1H NMR and H,H COSY NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX 400 MHz or 500 MHz spectrometer. The ppm values are reported relative to residual non-deuterated solvent (δ = 7.24 ppm for C6H6; δ = 1.92 ppm for CH3CN). 10 μlofD2O were added to some of the samples dissolved in benzene-d6, and the samples were analyzed again.CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-700 spectropolarimeter. The configuration of the hydroxyl group was assigned based on Cotton effects in the spectrum of the benzoate ester derivative. The benzoate group has a transition moment that is sufficiently close to that of the double bond adjacent to the hydroxyl group. This allows efficient coupling of the two chromophores, however, due to the relatively low λmax of the chromophores only the Cotton effect at higher wavelength is observed which is still sufficient to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule (26Gonnella N.C. Nakanishi K. Martin V.S. Sharpless B.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 3775-3776Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27Humpf H.-U. Berova N. Nakanishi K. Jarstfer M.B. Poulter C.D. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 3539-3542Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The methyl ester derivatives of the three diepoxyalcohol products 1-3 (about 25 μg each) were dissolved in 50 μl of dry acetonitrile and reacted with 1 μl of benzoyl chloride in the presence of 1 μl DBU and a few grains of dimethylaminopyridine at room temperature overnight. After evaporation of the solvent, 500 μl of water were added and the products were extracted using 1 ml of dichloromethane. The methyl ester, benzoate derivatives were isolated by RP-HPLC using a Waters Symmetry C18 5-μm column (0.46 × 25 cm) eluted with a solvent of methanol/water/acetic acid (95:5:0.01 by volume) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and UV detection at 235 nm. The products eluting at 5 min were collected and extracted from the HPLC solvent using dichloromethane. 1H NMR (400 MHz, in CD3CN) was used to confirm the structure of the derivative and to determine the coupling constants between H14 and H15 (product 1) and between H13 and H14 (products 2 and 3). In each case the existence of the conformer in which the geminal hydrogen at the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group is eclipsed with the hydrogen of the double bond was evident from the large coupling constant of 6.3 Hz (product 1) and 9.1 Hz (products 2 and 3). The methyl ester, benzoate derivatives were dissolved in acetonitrile to a final OD of 1.2-1.4 AU at 228 nm for recording of the CD spectra.RESULTSActivity of COX-2 Mutants—We prepared a series of human COX-2 enzymes with mutations of residues Leu-352, Leu-384, Trp-387, Phe-518, and Gly-526 (Fig. 1). The carbons on the side chains of these amino acids are located within 3-6 Å of the carbon chain of arachidonic acid, as seen in the crystal structure of ovine COX-1 (11Malkowski M.G. Ginell S.L. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and the associated hydrogen atoms are closer still (Table I). Mutations were selected with a view to changing the available space in the oxygenase active site while preserving the overall hydrophobic nature of the pocket. The mutations tested were a change of Leu-352 to Ala, Ile, Gln, Met, or Val; of Leu-384 to Phe or Trp; of Trp-387 to Phe or Tyr; of Phe-518 to Ile, Trp, or Tyr; and of Gly-526 to Ala, Ser, Thr, or Val. All mutants and the wild-type COX-2 were expressed in HeLa cells and subsequently incubated with 50 μm [14C]arachidonic acid and the product profile analyzed by RP-HPLC.Table IDistances between side chain carbon atoms of selected residues and arachidonic acid (AA) bound in the active site of ovine COX-1 (Protein Data Bank entry 1DIY) (11Malkowski M.G.

All mutants were catalytically active, many with similar activity to wild type. For the purposes of this comparison, the products shown for wild-type COX-2 are PGE2, (quantitatively accounting for 80-90% of the prostaglandins produced), 11-HETE and 15-HETE, taking their total as 100%. As can be seen on the left side of Fig. 2, the five different mutations to Leu-352 had almost no effect, either on activity or on the profile of products. In the middle part of Fig. 2, the three mutations to Phe-518 and two mutations to Trp-387 can be seen to increase the relative levels of 11-HETE and 15-HETE at the expense of PGE2. On the right side, illustrating the results with the Leu-384 and Gly-526 mutations, the appearance of two new HPLC peaks is indicated by the black bars and white bars; among the Leu-384 and Gly-526 mutant COX-2 enzymes, only the L384W and G526A mutants retain the ability to synthesize PGE2.Fig. 2Product formation and relative conversion of arachidonic acid by wild-type and mutant human COX-2 enzymes expressed in HeLa cells. Incubations were conducted and analyzed by RP-HPLC and chiral-phase HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentage (%) of the total of the products PGE2, 15-HETE, 11-HETE, and the novel products 1, 2, and 3, is given. Under the bar graph, the relative activity of the mutants is scored as the conversion of arachidonic acid compared with the wild-type set at 100%; ++++, 75-100%; +++, 50-75%; ++, 25-50%; +, <25%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For several of these mutations, the identity and the C15 stereochemistry of the [14C]PGE2 product was analyzed using a straight-phase HPLC system that easily resolves 15R-PGE2 and PGE2 (15Schneider C.

This analysis was carried out on PGE2 formed by the L352Q, F518I, F518Y, L384W, and G526A COX-2 enzymes, the latter two being the only ones that synthesized both PGE2 and the new products to be identified below. All these PGE2 analyses found exclusively natural (15S) PGE2 (Fig. 3A). 11-HETE is prominent in all the mutants that have an altered profile from wild type, and it is the dominant product in each of the Gly-526 mutant enzymes. The stereochemistry of the 11-[14C]HETE was measured by chiral column HPLC using a method that gives a 2-min baseline separation of the two enantiomers (25Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Anal.

https://openalex.org/W2027498615,"CD40 is a member of the growing tumor necrosis factor receptor family that has been shown to play important roles in T cell-mediated B lymphocyte activation. Ligation of B cell CD40 by CD154, mainly expressed on activated T cells, stimulates B cell proliferation, differentiation, isotype switching, up-regulation of surface molecules contributing to antigen presentation, development of the germinal center, and the humoral memory response. In this study we demonstrate that the redox factor APE/Ref-1 acts as a key signaling intermediate in response to CD40-mediated B cell activation. The transcription factors Pax5a or BSAP (B cell lineage-specific activator protein) and EBF (early B cell factor) are constitutively expressed in spleen B cells and CD40 cross-linking induces increases in Pax5a and EBF binding activity compared with nonstimulated B cells. We show that upon CD40 antibody-mediated cross-linking, APE/Ref-1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of activated B cells, where it modulates the DNA binding activity of both Pax5a and EBF. Moreover, we show that the repression of APE/Ref-1 protein production is able to block CD40-mediated Pax5a activation. We also provide evidence that APE/Ref-1 can modulate the cooperative activation of the blk promoter operated by Pax5a and EBF and that APE/Ref-1 might directly regulate EBF functional activity. Finally, we show that the interaction between Pax5a and EBF enhances EBF binding activity to its consensus sequence, suggesting that Pax5a can physically interact with EBF and modulate its DNA binding activity.

CD40 is a surface receptor expressed on B cells and certain accessory cells that belong to the pleiotropic growing tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The interaction between CD40 and its ligand (CD154), which is mainly expressed on activated CD4+ T cells, is critical in the regulation of immune response. Engagement of CD40 on B lymphocytes promotes proliferation, cytokine production, up-regulation of various surface molecules involved in antigen presentation, formation of germinal center, memory B cell, and antibody isotype switching (1.Durie F.H.

Immunity. 1996; 5: 527-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition to these serine-threonine kinases, a link between CD40 signaling and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been suggested (7.Ren C.L. Morio T. Fu S.M. Geha R.S. J. Exp.

In each of the above pathways, one of the major final outcomes is an alteration in the activity of one or more transcription factors. Pax5a or B cell lineage-specific activator protein (BSAP) 1The abbreviations used are: BSAP, B cell lineage-specific activator protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CMV, cytomegalovirus; luc, luciferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Tc, tetracycline; ROS, reactive oxygen species; EBF, early B cell factor. and EBF (early B cell factor) are two transcription factors essential for B cell development. Both are expressed at all stages of B cell development except in the plasma cell and are involved in the transcription control of several B cell restricted genes. Pax5a, the product of the Pax5 gene, is a member of a multigene family of transcription factors that share the paired box DNA binding domain and are important regulators of early development (10.Strachan T. Read A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The Pax5 gene is alternatively spliced during B cell development: the predominant form Pax5a (full-length Pax5), Pax5b, Pax5d, and Pax5e (11.Zwollo P. Arrieta H. Ede K. Molinder K. Desiderio S. Pollock R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10160-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Only Pax5a and Pax5d possess an intact DNA-binding domain, enabling them to interact with and compete for Pax5-binding sites on DNA. Pax5d and Pax5e do not have transactivation, repression, or partial homeodomain homology regions at the C terminus but present a 42-amino acid novel sequence with unknown function (11.Zwollo P.

We have previously shown that Pax5a activity is regulated through a redox mechanism. In particular we demonstrated that an oxidized form of Pax5a is unable to interact with DNA, whereas the reduced form binds strongly, and that an intramolecular disulfide bond within the paired domain of Pax5a causes interference with specific DNA binding (37.Tell G. Pellizzari L. Cimarosti D. Pucillo C. Damante G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, exposure of B cells to H2O2 results in rapid transfer of the cytoplasmic redox factor APE/Ref-1 into the nucleus, an event correlated with an increase in Pax5a binding activity (33.Tell G. Zecca A. Pellizzari L. Spessotto P. Colombatti A. Kelley M.R. Damante G. Pucillo C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). APE/Ref-1 (also designated HAP-1) is a trifunctional protein involved in apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease DNA base repair activity, in proofreading exonuclease activity (34.Jiricny J. Nature. 2002; 415: 593-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and in modulating DNA binding activity of several transcription factors including NF-κB, Egr-1, p53, and members of Pax family (33.Tell G.

Commun. 1998; 252: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The redox and repair activities of APE/Ref-1 are localized to distinct, nonoverlapping domains of the protein that function independently. The N-terminal domain is essential for redox activity and contains the nuclear localization sequence (residues 1–36) (38.Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar), whereas the endonuclease activity resides in the C-terminal region (39.Xanthoudakis S. Miao G.G. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). APE/Ref-1 expression is ubiquitous; however, it exhibits a complex and heterogeneous expression pattern that differs among tissue types (40.Kakolyris S. Kaklamanis L. Giatromanolaki A. Koukourakis M. Hickson I.D. Barzilay G. Turley H. Leek R.D. Kanavaros P. Georgoulias V. Gatter K.C. Harris A.L. Histopathology. 1998; 33: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Early B-cell factor was identified as a B lymphocyte-specific protein that recognizes a site in the mb-1 promoter (41.Hagman J. Travis A. Grosschedl R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3409-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 42.Hagman J. Belanger C. Travis A. Turck C.W. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 760-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This protein was also identified as olfactory factor 1 in olfactory neurons (43.Kudrycki K. Stein-Izsak C. Behn C. Grillo M. Akeson R. Margolis F.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3002-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). DNA binding studies showed that EBF binds as an homodimer and recognizes specific nucleotide sequences representing variations of an inverted repeat of a 5′-GGGA(A/T)T half-site separated by 2 bp spacer (42.Hagman J. Belanger C. Travis A. Turck C.W. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 760-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 44.Travis A. Hagman J. Hwang L. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3392-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). DNA binding activity is mediated by a novel zinc coordination motif in the amino-terminal half of EBF where there are also sequences that mediate DNA-dependent dimerization and transactivation (45.Hagman J. Gutch M.J. Lin H. Grosschedl R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2907-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal region of EBF contains a second, serine/threonine-rich activation domain with homology to the second helix of basic-helix-loop-helix proteins (42.Hagman J. Belanger C. Travis A. Turck C.W. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 760-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The deletion of these α-helical repeats was found to markedly reduce DNA binding and dimerization in solution. EBF was shown to interact with functional regions in the promoters of mb-1 (41.Hagman J.

This suggests that EBF has a role in the regulation of several genes encoding proteins of the pre-B and B cell receptor. Pax5a is required also during later stages of B cell development for the maintenance of mature B cell characteristics and function (51.Horcher M. Souabni A. Busslinger M. Immunity. 2001; 14: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), but the role of EBF in mature B cells is currently unknown. The aim of this work was to determine whether CD40-mediated stimulation of B lymphocytes promotes activation of EBF and Pax5a and to investigate the role of APE/Ref-1 in this process. Our data demonstrate that upon CD40 antibody-mediated cross-linking, APE/Ref-1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of activated B cells, where it is able to control the DNA binding activity of Pax5a. In addition, we show that APE/Ref-1 modulates EBF activity and the Pax5a and EBF cooperative activation of the blk promoter. Moreover, we observed that the interaction between Pax5a and EBF enhances EBF binding activity to its consensus sequence, suggesting that Pax5a can physically interact with EBF and modulate its DNA binding activity. Together, these data suggest a novel role of APE/Ref-1 in B cells CD40-mediated activation. Cell Preparation and Culture Conditions—Purified splenic B cells were obtained from 6–12-week-old female Balb/c mice as follows: splenocyte cell suspension were depleted of red blood cells by hypotonic lysis with ACK lysing buffer (BioWhittaker) and of T cells by complement-mediated cytotoxic lysis using anti-Thy 1.2 mAb (a gift from K. Hathcock, Experimental Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) in conjunction with rabbit complement (Low-Tox M; Cedar Lane). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 20 mm Hepes (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) (BioWhittaker), and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The resulting cells were checked by cytofluorimetric analysis (BD Biosciences FACScan) and then were incubated with purified anti-mouse CD40 mAb HM40-3 at 1 μg/ml (BD Pharmingen) for 72 h. All experiments reported in this paper were performed at this time point, which represent the maximum value of proliferation, assayed by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 1% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) (BioWhittaker Europe). NS-1 (non-secreting mouse myeloma) and Raji (Burkitt lymphoma) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and antibiotics (200 units/ml penicillin and 200 μg/ml streptomycin) (BioWhittaker Europe). Preparation of Cell Extracts—107 cells were washed twice with PBS and then resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT). The samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic extracts. Then, the pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT) to extract nuclear proteins. After incubation for 20 min on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts. For whole protein NS-1 extracts, 107 cells were re-suspended with 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and, after incubation for 20 min at 4 °C, the extracts were centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 20 min to remove all cell debris. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (52.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and the samples used immediately for Western blot or electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis or kept at –80 °C. Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of protein, obtained as described above, were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-PAGE minigel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) using a semidry apparatus (Multiphor II, Amersham Biosciences). The filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution: 5% nonfat milk powder in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). After washing with PBST, the membranes were incubated with primary Ab (diluted in blocking solution) overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at room temperature. APE/Ref-1 was detected by a rabbit polyclonal specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), actin and nucleoporin by the mouse polyclonal specific antibody (Sigma and BD Biosciences, respectively), and Pax5a by the mouse polyclonal specific antibody D2A8 generated in our laboratory (33.Tell G. Zecca A. Pellizzari L. Spessotto P. Colombatti A. Kelley M.R. Damante G. Pucillo C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The filters were then washed with PBST and incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) and Bio-Max light films (Kodak) according to the manufacturer's protocol. EMSA—The sequence of the top strand of double-stranded oligonucleotide probes used in EMSAs were: H2A2.2, 5′-TCTGACGCAGCGGTGGGTGACGACT; mb-1, 5′-GAGAGAGACTCAAGGGAATTGTGG; CREB, 5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG. Oligonucleotides were end labeled with [γ-32P]dATP by incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas), annealed, and purified on column spinX Costar 8160 (Corning) filled with Sephadex G-50 fine (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear extracts (8 μg) were incubated with 0.5–1 ng of labeled probe (10,000–20,000 cpm) for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT) with 1 μg of calf thymus and bovine serum albumin. In the EMSA experiment with the mb-1 probe, the binding buffer contained 0.2 mm ZnCl2. Unlabeled oligonucleotides as DNA competitors were added 10 min before the addition of DNA probe at molar excesses indicated in the respective figures. The samples were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide Tris borate-EDTA gel, which was dried and then exposed to a Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Biosciences) film at –80 °C. For in vitro experiments with recombinant proteins, EMSA were performed with the mb-1 probe incubated with 100 ng of GST-EBF oxidized protein, obtained after prolonged air exposure, in the presence or absence of 400 ng of APE/Ref-1 recombinant protein or with 10 μg of crude, boiled, or APE/Ref-1-depleted NS-1 cellular extracts. The immunoprecipitation of APE/Ref-1 was performed as described before (33.Tell G. Zecca A. Pellizzari L. Spessotto P. Colombatti A. Kelley M.R. Damante G. Pucillo C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In these experiments binding buffer did not contain EDTA and DTT. To test the role of Pax5a on EBF DNA binding activity, EMSA were performed with the mb-1 probe, equal amounts of oxidized GST-EBF and recombinant APE/Ref-1, and 100 ng of recombinant Pax5a. Moreover, 3 μg of stable NS-1 transfected with Pax5a (NS-1/Pax5a) nuclear extracts were incubated with or without 100 ng of GST-EBF. Oligonucleotide Treatment of B Cells—APE/Ref-1 antisense oligonucleotide and the complementary sense oligonucleotide were synthesized and HPSF purified by MWG-Biotech AG. The oligonucleotides were phosphorothioated at 3′ and 5′ ends (at the position marked by *) to confer nuclease resistance (53.Daily D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Offen D. Mittelman L. Melamed E. Holmgren A. Barzilai A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1335-1344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The sequence of the APE/Ref-1 antisense probe was 5′-T*T*CCCCGCTTTGGCATC*G*C*-3′, and sense was 5′-G*C*GATGCCAAAGCGGGG*A*A*-3′ (nucleotides –3 to 16). The probe did not show homology to other known genes according to the GenBank™ data base. Spleen B cells were washed once with serum-free media (Opti-MEM, Invitrogen) and then 1.6 ml of serum-free media was added for 4 × 106 cells in a 60-mm tissue culture plate. 25 μl of Lipofectin (Invitrogen) was diluted in 200 μl of serum-free media, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then mixed with the DNA (10 μg) diluted in 200 μl of serum-free media. The mixture was incubated for 15 min and the combined volume of 400 μl was added to the cells. The cells were then maintained in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 12 h, after which 2 ml of growth medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum was added to each transfection well. Then transfected cells (1 × 106/ml) were incubated with the appropriate stimulus. At the end of that incubation, culture growth was determined by counting, and viability was confirmed with trypan blue exclusion. Plasmids and Construction of the Bidirectional Expression Vector— The pBI vector (Clontech) allows to simultaneously express two genes under control of a bidirectional tetracycline-responsive promoter (Pbi-1) (54.Baron U. Freundlieb S. Gossen M. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3605-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Pbi-1 promoter contains the Tet-responsive element, which is repressed in the presence of tetracycline (Tc). pBI-GL (Clontech) allows the simultaneous regulation of both luciferase and β-galactosidase genes by one central Tet-responsive element. The 965-bp BamHI/EcoRI fragment containing hRef-1 cDNA was taken from pGEX-3X-hRef-1 (see below) and filled in with Klenow fragment. The resulting blunt fragment was cloned into the NheI Klenow filled in site of pBI to make pBI-APE/Ref-1. Primers EBF-NheI-REV (5′-GCAGCTAGCCACTCTGGGACTCATG-3′) and EBF-NheI-FOR (5′-GTAGCTAGCTGGGCAGCGGCATGAA-3′) containing the NheI restriction site were used to amplify the region encoding EBF cDNA, using CMV-EBF as a template. The amplified sequence was cloned into the NheI site of pBI to make pBI-EBF. DNA sequencing confirmed that all PCR products were free of any undesired mutations. The 1.2-kb and 750-bp NotI fragments containing Pax5a and Pax5d cDNA, respectively, were taken from pcDNA3.1-Pax5a and pcDNA3.1-Pax5d (11.Zwollo P. Arrieta H. Ede K. Molinder K. Desiderio S. Pollock R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10160-10168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and cloned into the NotI site of pBI to make pBI-Pax5a and pBI-Pax5d or cloned into the NotI site of pBI-EBF to make pBI-Pax5a-EBF and pBI-Pax5d-EBF, respectively, or in NotI site of PBI-Ref-1 to make pBI-Pax5a-APE/Ref-1 and pBI-Pax5d-APE/Ref-1, respectively. Generation of Stable Cells Expressing Various Transactivators and Quantification of Transactivation Activity—HeLa cells were grown in 35-mm dishes to 50–60% confluence and transfected via the calcium phosphate procedure with 5 μg of tTA2/3/4 (Clontech) plasmids. These are three vectors that express at different levels the tetracycline-sensitive Pbi-1 transactivator and cause expression of pBI cloned genes at different levels (55.Baron U. Gossen M. Bujard H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2723-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were transferred to 10-cm dishes and maintained in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). After 4 weeks, at least 30 resistant clones were isolated using cloning cylinders (Sigma) expanded separately and frozen as soon as possible. The presence of integrated tTA in neomycin-resistant cell lines were confirmed by PCR on chromosomal DNA using primers ptTA forward (5′-GTCTGGATCCTTACTTAGTTACCC-3′) and ptTA reverse (5′-ATAGAAGACACCGGGACCGATC-3′) that amplify a portion of the appropriate tTA plasmid. Positive clones were screened by transient transfections with PBI-GL reporter vector to identify G418-resistant clones that meet the criteria for good Tet-Off cell lines: low background and high induction of luciferase and β-galactosidase in response to Tc (2 μg/ml). A clone from HeLa-tTA2 cells (HeLa cells that constitutively synthesize tTA2) was selected for the highest -fold induction (e.g. showing highest expression with lowest background) for propagation and further testing. HeLa-tTA2 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cell/35-mm dish and grown in the presence or absence of Tc (2 μg/ml). The next day, 2 h prior to transfection, the culture medium was renewed and the cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The calcium phosphate/DNA precipitate contains 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA (consisting of 0.6 μg of pBI, 0.8 μg of pGLblk, 0.2 μg of lacZ expression vector (CMV-β-galactosidase), included for normalization of transfection efficiency, and pUC18 as nonspecific carrier DNA for equalization the DNA content in each transfection). The precipitate (55 μl/dish) was added to HeLa-tTA2 cells that were further incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h (56.Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The next day, the cells were washed twice in PBS and grown in the presence or absence of Tc (2 μg/ml). After 48 h the cells were scraped using TEN buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl), centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer provided"
https://openalex.org/W2076355885,"Fas (APO-1/CD95) is a cell surface receptor that initiates apoptotic pathways, and its cytoplasmic domain interacts with various molecules suggesting that Fas signaling is complex and regulated by multiple proteins. Calmodulin (CaM) is an intracellular Ca2+-binding protein, and it mediates many of the effects of Ca2+. Here, we demonstrate that CaM binds to Fas directly and identify the CaM-binding site on the cytoplasmic death domain (DD) of Fas. Fas binds to CaM-Sepharose and is co-immunoprecipitated with CaM. Other death receptors, such as tumor necrosis factor receptor, DR4, and DR5 do not bind to CaM. The interaction between Fas and CaM is Ca2+-dependent. Deletion mapping analysis with various GST-fused Fas cytoplasmic domain fragments revealed that the fragment containing helices 1, 2, and 3 of the Fas DD has the CaM-binding ability. Sequence analysis of this fragment predicted a potential CaM-binding site in helix 2 and connected loops. A valine 254 to asparagine mutation in this region, which is analogous to the identified mutant allele of Fas in lpr mice that have a deficiency in Fas-mediated apoptosis, showed reduced CaM binding. Computer modeling of the interaction between CaM and helix 2 of the Fas DD predicted that amino acids, which are important for Fas-CaM binding, and point mutations of these amino acids caused reduced Fas-CaM binding. The interaction between Fas and CaM is increased ∼2-fold early upon Fas activation (at 30 min) and is decreased to ∼50% of control at 2 h. These findings suggest a novel function of CaM in Fas-mediated apoptosis.

The Fas DD consists of six amphipathic α-helices arranged antiparallel to one another, with side chains of hydrophobic residues forming an extensive network of interactions that constitute the core of the protein. Helices 1 and 2 are centrally located with helices 3 and 4 on one side and helices 5 and 6 on the other (7Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Fas-FasL ligation leads to a clustering of the DDs of the receptors (7Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and an adapter protein, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) (8Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar), then binds through its own DD to the clustered-receptor DD. FADD also has a death effector domain that binds to an analogous domain in caspase-8 (9Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Several other cytoplasmic proteins that can bind to Fas have been identified, including Daxx (10Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), FAP-1 (Fas-associated phosphatase-1) (11Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), RIP (receptor-interacting protein) (12Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), and FAF1 (Fas-associated factor 1) (13Chu K. Niu X. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11894-11898Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). tumor necrosis factor receptor calmodulin death domain Fas-associated death domain-containing protein death-inducing signaling complex glutathione S-transferase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2. Calmodulin (CaM) acts as a major Ca2+ sensor and regulator through its interaction with a diverse group of cellular proteins. There is 100% identity in the amino acid sequence of CaM among vertebrates, with multiple genes encoding identical CaMs (14Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Structurally, CaM is a dumbbell shape formed by two globular domains at its C and N termini that are connected by a flexible helical linker region. The globular ends each contain a pair of Ca2+-binding motifs called EF-hands, and the binding of Ca2+ to CaM exposes a hydrophobic surface that is responsible for binding to various target proteins (15Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). The function of CaM is not confined to its Ca2+-bound form, because Ca2+-free CaM (apocalmodulin) can recognize different target proteins (16Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). More than 30 CaM-binding proteins have been identified, including enzymes such as kinases, phosphatases, and nitric-oxide synthase, as well as receptors, ion channels, G-proteins, and transcription factors (17Lee A. Wong S.T. Gallagher D. Li B. Storm D.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 18Liao B. Paschal B.M. Luby-Phelps K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6217-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Many known Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding proteins possess a region that is characterized by an amphipathic helix consisting of ∼20 amino acid residues. This region contains positively charged amino acids interspersed among hydrophobic residues (20James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Specific characteristics of the region for several CaM-binding proteins include a net positive charge, moderate hydrophilicity, and a moderate to high helical hydrophobic moment (21O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). However, these criteria do not always identify the CaM-binding region in target proteins. From sequence comparisons of CaM-binding peptides and CaM-binding domains within the CaM-regulated proteins, three classes of CaM-binding motifs have emerged. These classes include a modified variant of the IQ motif as a consensus for Ca2+-independent binding and two related motifs for Ca2+-dependent binding, termed 1-8-14 ((FILVW)XXXXXX(FAILVW)XXXXX(FILVW)) and 1-5-10 (XXX-(FILVW)XXX(FILV)XXXX(FILVW)) based on the conserved hydrophobic residues within these motifs (14Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that CaM binds to Fas directly and identify the CaM-binding site in the DD of Fas. We also show changes in the Fas-CaM interaction during Fas-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that CaM is a novel regulator of Fas-mediated apoptosis. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—Jurkat cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Calmodulin-Sepharose® 4B and GST antibody were from Amersham Biosciences, and Sepharose CL-4B was from Sigma. Antibodies were purchased from the following companies: antibodies for Fas (monoclonal, B-10) and TNFR from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), DR4 antibody and agonistic Fas antibody (clone CH11) from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), caspase-8 antibody from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and DR5 antibody from Sigma. Purified CaM (from bovine brain) was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The monoclonal antibody to CaM was developed as described previously (22Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CaM Pull-down Assay and Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100) or purified GST fusion protein diluted in binding buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 120 mm NaCl, 1% Brij) were incubated with Calmodulin-Sepharose® 4B or control Sepharose for 1-2 h at 4 °C as indicated in the figure legends. After washing, beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation with CaM antibody was performed using the Seize™primary mammalian immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For Western blot for CaM, membranes were then fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min. The membranes were blocked in 2% nonfat milk and incubated with primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Generating Fas Fragments by Polymerase Chain Reaction—Various fragments of human Fas were generated by PCR with the following forward (F) and reverse (R) primers containing EcoRI (italics) and XhoI (bold) sites (underlines indicate stop codons): F1, 5′-CCACTAATAATTCGTGAAGAGAAAGG-3′; F2, 5′-TCTGATGTTGAATTCAGTAAATATATC-3′; F3, 5′-GACAATGTCCAAGAATTCGCAGAACAGAAA-3′; R1, 5′-CATATACTCAGAATCGAGTTGTTGTTT-3′; R2, 5′-AGCAATACTCGAGATATATTTTCACAAGTC-3′; R3, 5′-AAGCACTCGAGCTTTCTGTTCTCATGTGTC-3′. The following combinations were used to produce the indicated human Fas fragments: (a) F1 and R1, amino acids 191-335; (b) F1 and R2, amino acids 191-229; (c) F1 and R3, amino acids 191-270; (d) F2 and R3, amino acids 230-270; and (e) F3 and R1, amino acids 271-335. The amino acid 191-320 fragment was generated by restriction endonuclease digestion of the 191-335 fragment with SpeI followed by treatment with T4 deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase to generate a stop codon. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to make Fas point mutations V254N, T241F, G247F, and F248A. Primers for the mutagenesis were purchased from Invitrogen. Preparation of GST Fusion Protein—Wild-type or mutated Fas cytoplasmic regions were inserted into the pGEX5-1 vector using EcoRI and XhoI sites. The expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were performed according to the manufacturer's directions for GST expression and purification systems (Amersham Biosciences). Computer-based Modeling of the CaM-Fas Interaction—The model of the interaction between CaM and the Fas DD helix 2 was prepared using RIBBONS (23Carson M. J. Mol. Graph. 1987; 5: 103-106Crossref Scopus (514) Google Scholar). This model was based on the crystal structure of calmodulin and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II peptide complex (24Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Binding of Fas to CaM-Sepharose—The interaction between Fas and CaM was first demonstrated by a CaM pull-down assay. Jurkat cell lysates were incubated with calmodulin-conjugated-Sepharose (CaM-Sepharose) or control Sepharose and Western blotted with Fas antibody. The results show that Fas is detected in CaM-Sepharose-bound proteins but not in control Sepharose-bound proteins (Fig. 1A). We also used lysates of other cells for the CaM pull-down assay: the normal human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10a), the human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7), the human pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIAPaca-2, PANC-1), the human cholangiocarcinoma cell line (Sk-ChA-1), primary cultures of mouse osteoclasts, and a mouse macrophage-lineage cell line (RAW 264.7). From all cell lysates tested, Fas was detected in CaM-Sepharose-bound proteins (data not shown). Because Fas belongs to the TNFR superfamily in which many members have structural similarity, we were interested in whether other receptors in the TNFR family interact with CaM. Western blot analysis of CaM-Sepharose-bound proteins showed no interaction between TNFR-1 (p55), DR4, or DR5 and CaM (Fig. 1A). Many of the CaM-target protein interactions are Ca2+-dependent (14Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). To investigate the Ca2+ dependence of Fas binding to CaM-Sepharose, the CaM pull-down assay was performed with cell lysates in Ca2+-supplemented buffer (1 mm) or EGTA-containing buffer (1 mm). Fig. 1B shows that the presence of EGTA abolished the binding of Fas to CaM-Sepharose, indicating that Fas binding to CaM-Sepharose is Ca2+-dependent. Co-immunoprecipitation of CaM and Fas—Because Fas binding to CaM-Sepharose was observed, we next investigated whether endogenous CaM and Fas interact in vivo. We immunoprecipitated CaM from the lysates of Jurkat cells with CaM antibody and tested for associated Fas by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, Fas was co-immunoprecipitated with CaM demonstrating that the Fas-CaM complex is present in cells. Direct Interaction of CaM and GST-Fas—Although we observed a Fas-CaM association in vitro and in vivo, we could not exclude the possibility that their association is mediated by other Fas-binding proteins present in the cell lysates. To demonstrate the direct binding between Fas and CaM, we performed in vitro binding assays. The Fas cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 191-335) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion protein affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose. This GST-Fas protein was clearly detected by the Fas antibody, which has an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain of Fas, confirming that the Fas cytoplasmic domain is attached to GST. We incubated GST-Fas with CaM-Sepharose in a binding buffer containing Ca2+ and tested for the interaction of GST-Fas to CaM-Sepharose by Western blot using a GST antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, GST-Fas bound to CaM-Sepharose but not to control Sepharose. GST alone did not show any interaction with CaM-Sepharose. We also tested for the binding of purified CaM to GST-Fas. After the incubation of GST-Fas or GST protein alone with purified CaM, GST-associated proteins were pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose, and the presence of CaM was determined by Western blot using the CaM antibody. Fig. 3B shows that CaM was pulled down by GST-Fas. These results confirm the direct interaction between Fas and CaM. Mapping of the Site on Fas Involved in Binding to CaM—To determine the region in the cytoplasmic domain of Fas that is required for binding to CaM, we prepared a series of Fas deletion mutants that were expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 4A) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose. These Fas deletion mutants were incubated with CaM-Sepharose, and the amount of CaM-bound Fas was determined by Western blot using a GST antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, fragments containing amino acids 191-335 (the entire Fas cytoplasmic domain; numbers represent amino acid sequence numbers), 191-320, and 191-270 bound to CaM-Sepharose; however, the 191-229 amino acid fragment did not bind to CaM-Sepharose suggesting that the 230-270 fragment contains the CaM-binding site(s). To further confirm that the 230-270 fragment contains the CaM-binding site(s), we generated 230-270 and 271-335 Fas fragments as GST fusion proteins. A CaM pull-down assay revealed that the 230-270 fragment, but not the 271-335 fragment, binds to CaM (Fig. 4B). The CaM-binding ability of Fas amino acids from 230 through 270 was further confirmed by incubation with pure CaM. Three different GST fusion Fas cytoplasmic regions, 191-229, 230-270, and 271-335, were incubated with purified CaM and pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose. Western blot analysis, using the CaM antibody, demonstrated that only the 230-270 fragment pulls down CaM (Fig. 4C). We also incubated the GST-Fas-(230-270) fragment with CaM-Sepharose in the presence of EGTA and confirmed that the interaction of the 230-270 fragment with CaM is Ca2+-dependent (Fig. 4D). Prediction of CaM-binding Motif—Fas amino acids 230-270 cover the helices 1, 2, and 3 of the DD of Fas. We examined the amino acid sequence of 230-270 to identify the possible CaM-binding site. The 41 amino acids between amino acid residue 230 and 270 were checked for CaM-binding regions using a Web-based data base, the cellular calcium information server, 2The data base is available at calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca. provided by Dr. Ikura's laboratory at the Ontario Cancer Institute (see also Ref. 19Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). This sequence analysis normalizes scores (0-9) based on multiple criteria, e.g. hydropathy, α-helical propensity, residue weight, residue charge, hydrophobic residue content, helical class, and the occurrence of particular residues. A repeated high score indicates the location of a putative binding site (25Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The search results showed a series of high scores (∼9) for helix 2 and the connected loops (Fig. 5). Although CaM binds to diverse sequences in a diverse group of proteins, sequence comparisons of CaM-binding peptides and CaM-binding domains within CaM-regulated proteins have classified three recognition motifs for CaM interaction (14Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). They include a modified variant of the IQ motif as a consensus for Ca2+-independent binding and two related motifs for Ca2+-dependent binding, termed 1-8-14 ((FILVW)XXXXXX(FAILVW)XXXXX(FILVW)) and 1-5-10 (XXX(FILVW)XXX(FILV)-XXXX(FILVW)) based on the conserved hydrophobic residues within these motifs. In the Fas 230-270 region, we predicted a possible CaM-binding motif, LSQVKGFVRKNGV (Fig. 5, underlined). This sequence fits the 1-5-10 motif (XXX(FILVW)XXX(FILV)XXXX(FILVW)) with a net charge of +3. This region corresponds to helix 2 and the loop between helices 2 and 3 of the Fas DD. Although a part of helix 1 was also highly scored by the cellular calcium information server data base,2 we could not find a classical CaM-binding motif in this region; it does not contain charged amino acids. Taken together, these results predict that the helix 2 area, containing the 1-5-10 motif, is the most likely CaM-binding site. The Effect of Fas Point Mutations on CaM Binding—Next, we changed single amino acids in the putative CaM-binding site to determine whether these changes affect Fas-CaM binding. First, we changed valine 254 to asparagine (V254N). Valine 254 is located in the loop between helices 2 and 3 and is one of the hydrophobic residues that meet the criteria for the 1-5-10 motif. Interestingly, V254N is analogous to an identified mutant allele of Fas in the cg strain of lpr-autoimmune mice that have been shown to be deficient in Fas-mediated apoptosis. In addition, this mutation has been shown to reduce both the self-association of the Fas DD and binding to FADD, suggesting that it alters the protein structure (7Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To determine CaM-binding to this mutation, we generated the whole cytoplasmic region of Fas with the V254N mutation as a GST fusion protein and tested for binding of this mutated Fas fragment to CaM-Sepharose. As shown in Fig. 6A, the V254N mutant has a reduced CaM-binding ability when compared with wild-type Fas. To predict other amino acid changes that might possibly affect CaM-Fas binding, we modeled the three-dimensional structure of CaM bound to a peptide corresponding to the Fas 230-270 fragment (Fig. 6B). A threonine 241 mutation to phenylalanine (T241F), a glycine 247 mutation to phenylalanine (G247F), and a phenylalanine 248 mutation to alanine (F248A) are predicted to be substitutions that will maximally affect binding to CaM, because three-dimensional computer modeling predicts that these residues have close interactions with CaM (Fig. 6B). The effect of these mutations on CaM binding was tested using CaM-Sepharose. Whole Fas cytoplasmic regions containing T241F, G247F, or F248A were prepared as GST fusion proteins and incubated with CaM-Sepharose, and the amount of CaM-bound Fas was determined by Western blot with a GST antibody. Fig. 6C shows that all three mutations have reduced CaM-binding ability when compared with wild type. These results support our prediction that helix 2 of the Fas DD is responsible for the interaction with CaM. Changes in Fas-CaM Interaction during Fas-mediated Apoptosis—Because CaM binds to the Fas DD and may therefore regulate Fas-mediated apoptosis, we tested whether the Fas-CaM interaction is altered during the early stage of Fas-mediated apoptosis. We treated Jurkat cells with the agonistic Fas antibody (clone CH11) for 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with CaM antibody, and the amount of Fas bound to CaM was assessed by Western blot for Fas. Interestingly, upon the activation of Fas with the agonistic antibody, the binding between Fas and CaM was increased by ∼2-fold in 30 min. This binding was then decreased to ∼50% of the control after 2 h (Fig. 7). These results indicate that CaM binds to Fas with more affinity in response to Fas activation followed by its release from Fas, suggesting that Fas-CaM interaction is functionally significant. Fas is one of the well characterized death receptors that initiates the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. After Fas was first discovered as a mediator of cell death (1Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar), considerable effort was focused on identifying the downstream molecules, especially those that bind to the Fas cytoplasmic domain. Although several Fas-binding molecules such as FADD (8Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar), Daxx (10Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), FAP-1 (11Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), RIP (12Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), and FAF1 (13Chu K. Niu X. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11894-11898Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) have been identified, many aspects of Fas-mediated apoptosis remain undetermined. Moreover, Fas can not only induce apoptosis in many cell types, but it can also mediate cell proliferation in certain cell types (26Owen-Schaub L.B. Meterissian S. Ford R.J. J. Immunother. 1993; 14: 234-241Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Alderson M.R. Armitage R.J. Maraskovsky E. Tough T.W. Roux E. Schooley K. Ramsdell F. Lynch D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2231-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), suggesting that the engagement of Fas and its ligand transduces a variety of biological effects, which may be mediated by interactions of the Fas cytoplasmic domain with various molecules. In this report, we demonstrated for the first time that CaM interacts with the Fas DD directly and that the interaction between CaM and Fas is altered during Fas-mediated apoptosis, suggesting a functional significance of this interaction. We confirmed CaM-Fas binding by several methods, including a CaM pull-down assay with CaM-Sepharose, immunoprecipitation, and an in vitro binding assay with purified proteins. Additionally, we identified a CaM-binding site in the Fas DD by analyzing the Fas amino acid sequence and using deletions and point mutations of Fas. These findings are important not only for understanding Fas-mediated apoptosis but also for expanding the knowledge of CaM, which has been known to interact with diverse molecules. Although CaM interacts with a large number of proteins via diverse binding motifs, even more interesting is the diversity of the molecular and functional roles of CaM binding. The interaction of CaM with CaM-dependent serine/threonine protein kinases (CaM kinase I/II/IV, CaM kinase kinase, and myosin light chain kinase) and the phosphatase calcineurin displaces autoinhibitory domains in the proteins to induce full activation of these enzymes. CaM binding also causes rearrangement of key switches to create the active site in target proteins (28Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y.Q. Lu D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 29Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) and dimerization of membrane proteins, such as the small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channels (29Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 30Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Based on such diverse target-protein activation mechanisms, it is of interest to consider the role of CaM that is bound to Fas. We observed that a C-terminal 15-amino acid deletion mutant of Fas (191-320) strongly interacts with CaM, relative to the association of the whole Fas-cytoplasmic domain with CaM (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that the interaction between Fas and FADD is also enhanced when the C-terminal 15 amino acids of Fas are deleted (8Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). This deletion probably causes a conformational change in Fas, which helps both FADD and CaM gain access and bind to Fas. Therefore, it is possible that CaM may compete with FADD for binding to Fas. It is also possible that CaM acts as a bridging molecule between different proteins, because CaM-binding sites may not always exist on a single target protein (29Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). We screened the CaM-binding abilities of several molecules, which are known as DISC (death-inducing signaling complex) components, and identified one DISC component, c-FLIP, as a CaM-binding molecule, 3E.-Y. Ahn and J. M. McDonald, unpublished observations. consistent with our hypothesis that CaM acts as a bridging molecule between the Fas DD and other DISC components. In this report, we have shown that during Fas-mediated apoptosis the interaction between Fas and CaM is altered, and CaM binding to Fas was increased in 30 min after Fas activation and then decreased after 2 h (Fig. 7). Together with our published and unpublished data showing that CaM antagonists can induce apoptosis in human cholangiocarcinoma cells (31Pan G. Vickers S.M. Pickens A. Phillips J.O. Ying W. Thompson J.A. Siegal G.P. McDonald J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Ahn E.Y. Pan G. Oh J.H. Tytler E.M. McDonald J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 2053-2063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and Jurkat cells, 3E.-Y. Ahn and J. M. McDonald, unpublished observations. the decrease in Fas-CaM binding 2 h after Fas activation suggests that the release of CaM from Fas facilitates apoptotic pathways. However, the reason for the initial increase in the binding of CaM to Fas 30 min after Fas activation is less obvious. Interestingly, this biphasic Fas-CaM interaction is somewhat analogous to the pattern of ERK1/2 activation in response to Fas activation. It has been reported that the activation of ERK1/2 is induced rapidly (in ∼5 min) after agonistic Fas antibody treatment and then is down-regulated after 1 h (33Tran S.E.F. Holmström T.H. Ahonen M. Kähäri V.M. Eriksson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16484-16490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition, ERK1/2 activation has been shown to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis through suppression of cleavage caspase-8 and Bid, and pretreatment with an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 activation pathway sensitizes cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis (34Holmström T.H.

Similarly, we have observed that caspase-8 cleavage was accelerated when cells were pretreated with CaM antagonists before Fas activation. 3E.-Y. Ahn and J. M. McDonald, unpublished observations. Therefore, it is possible that the initial increase in Fas-CaM binding plays an inhibitory role as a “counteraction” or a “buffering action” to delay or suppress the early steps of Fas-mediated apoptosis, including caspase-8 cleavage. The exact mechanism by which CaM affects Fas-mediated apoptosis is under investigation in our laboratory. Although we demonstrated that CaM binding to Fas requires Ca2+ molecule (Figs. 1B and 4D), Ca2+ may not be the sole regulator of CaM-Fas binding in vivo. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration during Fas-mediated apoptosis have been documented by several groups. Sen et al. (35Sen C.K. Sashwati R. Packer L. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) measured intracellular Ca2+ concentration every 15 min during the first 2 h of Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. They observed no change in intracellular Ca2+ concentration until 60 min after Fas activation and a remarkable increase after 2 h. Scoltock et al. (36Scoltock A.B. Bortner C.D. Bird G.S.J. Putney Jr., J.W. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30586-30596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) also reported that agonistic Fas antibody treatment of Jurkat cells resulted in a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ commencing between 1 and 2 h after treatment and persisting until subsequent loss of cell membrane integrity. We have also observed an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration at 4 and 8 h after Fas activation in carcinoma cells (32Ahn E.Y. Pan G. Oh J.H. Tytler E.M. McDonald J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 2053-2063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we observed a deceased CaM-Fas binding 2 h after Fas activation (Fig. 7). Given this information, we propose that the dynamic changes in Fas-CaM interaction during the early stage of Fas-mediated apoptosis may not correlate simply with overall intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Although Ca2+ is necessary for Fas-CaM interaction, it is likely that other factors, such as conformational changes of the Fas cytoplasmic domain after Fas activation and recruitment of other molecules to Fas, also regulate the ability of CaM to bind to the Fas DD. It is still possible that the alteration of Fas-CaM binding is affected, at least partially, by the local changes of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Generally, Ca2+-binding dyes have been used to measure the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and the results represent the average Ca2+ concentration in the cytoplasm. However, Ca2+ is not evenly distributed in the cytoplasm; the Ca2+ concentration may be much higher within the microdomains around the mouths of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane or on the internal Ca2+ stores (37Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). Therefore, the localized Ca2+ concentration near the Fas cytoplasmic domain might regulate CaM binding, which could be proven by more detailed imaging of Ca2+ compartmentalization. The observations in this report provide novel insights into both elucidation of the mechanism of apoptosis and understanding the function of calmodulin. Fundamental understanding of the role of CaM binding to Fas may also provide a new therapeutic modality with CaM antagonists targeting the Fas-CaM interaction. We thank Margaret A.

Here we present data indicating that, in the neuronal electrogenic sodium- and potassium-coupled glutamate transporter EAAC-1, the substrate-binding site and one of the gates, or a residue controlling the gating process, are in close physical proximity. Arginine 445, located only two residues away from a residue implicated in glutamate binding (Bendahan, A., Armon, A., Madani, N., Kavanaugh, M. P., and Kanner, B. I. (2000) J. Biol.

Upon expression in oocytes, measurements of l-[3H]-glutamate transport under voltage clamp reveal that the charge/flux ratio for l-glutamate at –60 mV is ∼30-fold higher than that of the wild type. Also, with d-aspartate, R445S exhibits an ∼15-fold increase in this ratio. In contrast to the wild type, the reversal potential of the substrate-dependent currents in R445S shifts to more negative potentials when either the external sodium or potassium concentration is decreased. These findings indicate that these two cations are the main current carriers in the R445S mutant. Introduction of a methionine or a glutamine, but not a lysine, at position 445 gives rise to a phenotype similar to R445S. Therefore, it seems that the elimination of a positive charge in the vicinity of the substrate-binding site converts the transporter into a glutamate-gated cation-conducting pathway.

Glutamate transporters mediate a stoichiometric (coupled) current and a non-stoichiometric (uncoupled) current (20.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P.

Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Structure-function investigations of glutamate transporters have revealed that many important determinants for substrate interaction reside in domains highly conserved within the family. Transmembrane domain 7, positioned between the two oppositely oriented reentrant loops, contains Tyr-403 and Glu-404, which seem to be involved in K+ interaction (19.Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 25.Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Zarbiv R. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Determinants for Na+ and Li+ interaction have been found both in transmembrane domain 7 (Thr-400) and in the second reentrant loop (Ser-440 and Ser-443) (24.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26.Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A conserved arginine, at position 477 in glutamate transporter-1 (corresponding to Arg-447 in EAAC1) in transmembrane domain 8, has been shown to play a pivotal role in the interaction with the acidic amino acid substrate and the potassium ion (27.Bendahan A. Armon A. Madani N. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Despite these significant insights, little is known about the molecular basis linking substrate interaction with stoichiometric coupling. Here we report that, when Arg-445 is mutated to non-positive residues, large glutamate-dependent leak currents but greatly diminished l-[3H]-glutamate uptake rates are observed upon expression of these mutants in oocytes. These leak currents are carried by Na+ and K+. It seems, therefore, that a positive charge in the vicinity of the substrate-binding pocket controls the ability of the transporter to couple the fluxes of cations and glutamate. Site-directed Mutagenesis—An existing construct of rabbit EAAC1 residing in pBluescript SK(–) (27.Bendahan A. Armon A. Madani N. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was modified to have a stop codon immediately after a 10-histidine tail and to remove a 1.6-kbp 3′ untranslated region. An NsiI site was engineered into the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter 1 (GAT1) tagged with a 10-histidine tail between this site and the stop codon. The stop codon is located just before the poly-linker of pBluescript SK(–). Both of these constructs were cut with restriction enzymes NsiI and XhoI, and the EAAC1 sequence obtained therefrom was ligated to the 10-histidine pBluescript SK(–) background, now devoid of GAT1. This construct, termed E10H, was used as a parent for single-stranded U-DNA generation and subsequent annealing of the antisense mutagenic primer, as described previously (24.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Expression and Uptake in Oocytes—Restriction enzymes StuI and NsiI were used to subclone the mutant sequence from E10H into EAAC1 residing in the vector pOG2, where it is flanked by a 5′ untranslated Xenopus β-globin sequence and a 3′ poly-(A) signal (Ref. 27.Bendahan A.

The mutant sequence is termed WT-EAAC1 in this study. The subcloned sequence was sequenced on both strands between the two restriction sites noted above. cRNA was transcribed by using mMESSAGEmMA-CHINE (Ambion), injected into X. laevis oocytes, and maintained as described previously (24.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology and Current-flux Measurement—Voltage jumping was performed by using a conventional two-electrode voltage clamp, as described previously (24.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Agarose-cushioned micropipettes (1%/2 M KCl) were used on some batches of oocytes to prevent KCl leakage (28.Schreibmayer W. Lester H.A. Dascal N. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 426: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). All current-voltage relations represent steady-state net currents ((Ibuffer+AA) – (Ibuffer)) elicited by the amino acids (AA) l-aspartate, d-aspartate, or l-glutamate and were analyzed with Clampfit version 6.05 (Axon Instruments). Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear fitting to the generalized Hill equation using built-in functions of Origin version 6.1 (Microcal), as described previously (24.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The standard buffer was composed of 130 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4. In chloride substitution experiments, gluconate salts were used, and an agarose (2%/2 M KCl) bridge was used to connect the recording chamber to the Ag/AgCl ground electrode. In sodium substitution experiments, NaCl was replaced by equimolar concentrations of choline chloride. In experiments where the potassium concentration was varied, the sodium concentration was held constant at 20 mm, and 110 mm NaCl was substituted iso-osmotically with mixtures of choline chloride and KCl so that the potassium concentration ranged between 2.5 and 110 mm. Current-flux experiments were performed by clamping the oocyte at –60 mV, stopping the gravity flow, and then adding 100 μm d-aspartate or l-glutamate containing d-[2,3-3H]-aspartic acid (0.39 Ci/mmol) or l-[G-3H]-glutamic acid (0.40 Ci/mmol), respectively, directly into the bath. After perfusion for 200 s, the gravity flow was re-started, and the substrate was washed out. To remove any nonspecific radioactivity transferred by the pipette, the oocyte was washed briefly in four Petri dishes prior to transferal to scintillation vials. In current-flux experiments, the current was low-pass-filtered at 10 kHz and acquired once each msec with Axoscope1 (Axon Instruments). The amount of charge translocated was determined after baseline subtraction as the areaunder-curve with Clampfit 8 (Axon Instruments) and converted to moles using Faraday's constant. Altered Substrate Interaction in Mutants at Position 445—We reasoned that residues close in the primary sequence to R447 that have been proposed to interact with the γ-carboxyl group of di-carboxyl substrates in EAAC1 (27.Bendahan A. Armon A. Madani N. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) could also be involved in substrate interaction. This possibility was investigated by subjecting residues in the stretch from D444 to N451 to site-directed mutagenesis. We found that, when the arginine at position 445 (R445-EAAC1) was changed, saturating concentrations of the various acidic amino acid substrates elicited currents of different magnitude. Substitutions at other positions did not have this effect (data not shown). The WT-EAAC1-mediated currents show no difference in size when elicited by 1 mm of either d-aspartate, l-aspartate, or l-glutamate (Fig. 1). This concentration is saturating for all three substrates on WT-EAAC1 (4.Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar), and the similarity in the size of the current agrees with that reported for WT-EAAC1 and its human homologue, EAAT3 (4.Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 29.Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the size of R445S-EAAC1-mediated currents varies dramatically with the substrate (Fig. 1). At –60 mV, the net currents elicited by 1 mm l-aspartate or d-aspartate are 43 ± 1.6% (n = 10) and 12 ± 2% (n = 10), respectively, of that by l-glutamate (n = 10). To ascertain that 1 mm also is a saturating concentration for R445S-EAAC1, its apparent affinity (Km) for these substrates was determined by recording the currents at varying substrate concentrations. In agreement with previous studies on the human homologue of WT-EAAC1 (29.Arriza J.L. Fairman W.A. Wadiche J.I. Murdoch G.H. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5559-5569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), WT-EAAC1 currents elicited by d-aspartate and l-glutamate at –60 mV are fully saturated at 300 μm; the Km for d-aspartate is 37 ± 4.2 μm (n = 4; nH = 0.9 ± 0.02), and for l-glutamate, it is 29 ± 6.4 μm (n = 4; nH = 0.9 ± 0.05; data not shown). In R445S-EAAC1, the l-glutamate current at –60 mV is also fully saturated at 300 μm, but, in contrast to WT-EAAC1, the Km for l-glutamate is 4.8 ± 1.3 μm (n = 4; nH = 0.95 ± 0.05; data not shown). The net currents elicited by d-aspartate in R445S saturate at 10 μm, and the concentration eliciting half-maximum current, at –60 mV, is 0.28 ± 0.02 μm (n = 5; nH = 1.0 ± 0.1, data not shown). Effect of Removing Extracellular Chloride—It is now well established that glutamate transporters mediate an inwardly rectifying current reflecting the stoichiometric forward uptake, as well as a non-rectifying bi-directional uncoupled anion conductance (20.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 23.Borre L. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13501-13507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By removing chloride from the external recording solution, the outward current resulting from inward flux of chloride should be abolished. In agreement with previous studies (20.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), the outward current is indeed abolished in WT-EAAC1 when external chloride is replaced by gluconate (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, the outward current mediated by R445S-EAAC1 is still observed in the nominal absence of extracellular chloride (Fig. 2), indicating that the outward current mediated by R445S-EAAC1 is carried by ions other than chloride. Experiments in which chloride is partially substituted by the ∼70-fold more permeant thiocyanate anion (24.Borre L. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30.Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) results in an increased outward current (data not shown), indicating that R445S-EAAC1 is capable of entering the uncoupled anion pathway even though the minor change in the reversal potential upon chloride substitution (Fig. 2) indicates that this anion contributes little to the total current. Effect of Other Residues at Position 445—Additional mutants have been made and analyzed to determine whether it is the removal of the arginine or the introduction of a serine at position 445 which is responsible for both the altered substrate specificity as well as for the chloride-independent outward currents. Substituting Arg-445 with the polar but non-charged glutamine (Fig. 3) or with the bulky and hydrophobic methionine (data not shown) results in currents whose size varies with the substrate, as found for R445S-EAAC1 (Fig. 1). Strikingly, currents are similar in size in a mutant where the arginine is substituted by the positively charged lysine (Fig. 3), just as is the case for WT-EAAC1 (Fig. 1). The results on the substitution mutants at position 445 raise the possibility that the ability of mutant transporters to exhibit currents which vary with substrate is related to their ability to carry out substrate-elicited outward currents in the nominal absence of chloride. Indeed significant outward currents mediated by both R445Q-EAAC1 (Fig. 4) and R445M-EAAC1 (data not shown) persist in the absence of external chloride, as is the case for R445S-EAAC1 (Fig. 2). In contrast, the outward current mediated by R445K-EAAC1 is abolished when external chloride is replaced by the impermeable gluconate anion (Fig. 4), exactly as observed with WT-EAAC1 (Fig. 2). Effect of Changing the Extracellular Na+ and K+ Concentrations—We addressed the question of which ions are carrying the substrate-elicited outward currents in R445S-EAAC1. The observed reversal potential of –3.8 ± 0.9 mV (n = 17) (Fig. 2) is in between the equilibrium potentials for sodium and potassium, suggesting the possibility that R445S-EAAC1 is permeant to these two cations. To test this idea, l-glutamate currents mediated by R445S-EAAC1 and WT-EAAC1 were recorded at various extracellular Na+ concentrations (Fig. 5, A and B). In the absence of sodium (choline substitution), no glutamate-induced currents were observed in either case (Fig. 5, A and B). Significant substrate-elicited outward currents were observed above ∼30 mm Na+ in WT-EAAC1, and the reversal potential shifted toward more positive values with decreasing Na+ concentrations (Fig. 5B). In contrast, when the extracellular Na+ concentration was decreased from 130 to 10 mm, the reversal potential of the R445S-EAAC1-mediated currents shifted from 1.6 ± 1.6 mV to –39 ± 1.6 mV (n = 3) (Fig. 5A). In addition, both the size and conductance of the substrate gated currents in R445S-EAAC1 increased as the extracellular Na+ concentration increased (Fig. 5A), indicating an increased inward flux of sodium as the inward Na+ gradient increased. The observed shift in reversal potential is less than the 64.8 mV predicted by the Nernst equation for a selective Na+ flux. A possible explanation is that glutamate causes R445S to become more permeant not only to sodium but also to potassium. At 2.5 mm K+ and 20 mm Na+, bi-directional substrate-elicited currents were observed in R445S that reversed at –36 ± 1.7 mV (n = 3) (Fig. 5C). If glutamate increases the permeability for potassium, one would predict a shift in this reversal potential toward more positive potentials as the potassium concentration increased. The net currents depicted in Fig. 5C show that this is exactly what happened in R445S. In contrast, the WT-EAAC1-mediated currents remained inward and did not reverse when the potassium concentration increased to 40 or 110 mm (n = 3) (Fig. 5D). This behavior of WT-EAAC1 will be addressed in “Discussion.” In R445S, glutamate also elicited currents in lithium medium but not in Tris Plus medium (data not shown) or choline chloride (Fig. 5A). Increasing the MgCl2 concentration from 1 to 20 mm did not change the substrate-gated currents (data not shown). Changing the pH from 7.5 to 6.5 or 8.5 also did not influence the size and reversal potential of the currents mediated by R445S-EAAC1 (n = 3; data not shown). Determination of the Charge to Flux Ratio in WT-EAAC1 and R445S-EAAC1—Whereas the currents mediated by R445S-EAAC1 were of equal size or larger than those mediated by WT-EAAC1, the velocity of radioactive uptake by R445S was much lower. The kinetic parameters of uptake by R445S-EAAC1 are: Km = 6.4 ± 1 μm and Vmax = 16 ± 1 pmol/20 min for l-glutamate; and Km = 4 ± 0.5 μm and Vmax = 33 ± 0.9 pmol/20 min for d-aspartate (nH = 1.1 ± 0.2 in all cases; n = 3–5; data not shown). In comparison, the corresponding values for WT-EAAC1 are: Km = 54 ± 7 μm and Vmax = 558 ± 34 pmol/20 min (nH = 1.0 ± 0.05) for l-glutamate and Km = 30 ± 2 μm and Vmax = 570 ± 19 pmol/20 min (nH = 1.2 ± 0.05) for d-aspartate (n = 3–5; data not shown). To substantiate the impression that R445S-EAAC1 translocates many more charges than WT-EAAC1 with each molecule of l-glutamate, currents have been recorded simultaneously during radiolabeled uptake on the same oocytes. A holding potential of –60 mV was chosen to be able to measure significant d-aspartate-elicited currents. Fig. 6A shows a typical result from oocytes clamped at –60 mV and expressing either WT-EAAC1, R445S-EAAC1, or GAT1 (31.Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-160102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In WT-EAAC1, an uptake of 22.4 pmol d-[3H]-aspartate was associated with a steady-state current of around –45 nA. Interestingly, the R445S-EAAC1 mutant only takes up 3.4 pmol d-[3H]-aspartate. Despite this diminished uptake, the translocated substrate elicits a current larger than twice that of WT-EAAC1. As a control, we used oocytes expressing GAT1 which do not transport glutamate or aspartate; no substrate-gated currents are measurable in these oocytes, and the d-[3H]-aspartate uptake is 0.62 pmol, similar to uptake by uninjected oocytes (data not shown) which probably reflects nonspecific binding. The charge/flux ratio in WT-EAAC1 is 6.7 ± 0.9 for l-glutamate (n = 11) and 5.1 ± 0.5 for d-aspartate (n = 9) (Fig. 6B). In striking contrast to WT-EAAC1, the charge/flux ratios in R445S-EAAC1 are dramatically increased: 217 ± 32 for l-glutamate (n = 7) and 74 ± 7.4 for d-aspartate (n = 6). The recent crystal structures of the lactose permease and the glycerol-3-phosphate transporter, both in their inward-facing conformation, identify the substrate-binding site in an inwardfacing Λ-shaped structure. According to an alternating access mechanism, this structure is proposed to change into an outward facing V-shaped structure, such that the binding site will be outward facing (32.Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 33.Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). In the discussion that follows, the conformational movements between the outward- and inward-facing forms that take place during the substrate translocation are referred to as opening and closing of outer and inner gates. The model depicted in Fig. 7 represents the alternating access translocation cycle of the wild-type glutamate transporter EAAC1 (17.Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18.Pines G. Kanner B.I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11209-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 19.Kavanaugh M.P. Bendahan A. Zerangue N. Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1703-1708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and serves as a framework to explain the results from this study. Also indicated is the state at which the R445S mutant is suggested to differ. Translocation occurs when the transporter is loaded with either the sodium/glutamate/proton or with potassium. One full transport cycle represents the sequential translocation of sodium/glutamate/proton in one direction and of potassium in the opposite direction (15.Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 17.Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). State I represents the empty and outward-facing transporter with a closed inner gate, to which either sodium/glutamate/proton (indicated by Glu for short) or potassium can bind in a mutually exclusive fashion. Under normal physiological conditions, binding of sodium/glutamate/proton (Step 1) brings the transporter into State II, where the potassium-binding site is altered such that potassium no longer can bind. The normal forward uptake cycle for wild type proceeds clockwise from State II, yielding the inward-facing sodium/glutamate/protonbound conformation of State III. Their release to the inside, indicated by Step 3, yields the empty inward-facing conformation of State IV, where the outer gate is closed but where the inner gate now is open. In this empty, inward-facing conformation, potassium or sodium/glutamate/proton can (re-)bind in a mutually exclusive fashion. Under physiological conditions, with low intracellular sodium and higher intracellular than extracellular potassium, it is this latter cation that binds (Step 4) and brings the transporter into State V. The potassium-bound transporter “reorients” to the outside (Step 5), after which potassium is released (Step 6), bringing the transporter back to State I from where a new cycle can start. Compared with the wild type, the R445S mutant exhibits enhanced glutamate- and aspartate-induced currents despite a greatly reduced radioactive uptake (Fig. 6). Also in contrast to the wild type, the R445S-mediated currents are not carried by chloride (Fig. 2) but rather are carried by sodium and potassium (Fig. 5). These data can be explained in terms of a phenotype in which State III has a defect in the closing rate of the outer gate. Such a defect will result in a situation where both gates are simultaneously open, thereby creating the conducting pathway through which sodium can enter the cell at negative potentials and potassium can exit at positive potentials (indicated by State III for R445S in Fig. 7). From the conducting glutamate-bound State III, R445S enters a non-conducting state; glutamate may be released either to the inside (Step 3) or back to the outside by progressing counter-clockwise from State III to State I. Alternatively, the conducting state of R445S may also occur if glutamate binding (Step 1, clockwise) causes both gates to be open simultaneously by premature inner gate opening. The R445S phenotype is described equally well by either possibility. However, we favor the possibility in which the outer gate closure is affected, because if transmembrane domain 8 has a linear sequence in space (9.Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 34.Slotboom D.J. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), position 445 will be more extracellular than position 447. The reversal potential of the R445S-mediated currents shifts toward negative potentials when the external sodium or potassium concentration is decreased (Fig. 5, A and C). The shift in reversal potential with potassium for the stoichiometrically coupled process is in the opposite direction (15.Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The outward currents mediated by wild type are caused by the sodium- and glutamate-gated chloride influx (Refs. 20.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 23.Borre L. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30.Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and Fig. 2) which is activated during Steps 1 and 2 (35.Grewer C. Watzke N. Wiessner M. Rauen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9706-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 36.Otis T.S. Kavanaugh M.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2749-2757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observed reversal potential shift in wild type with sodium is in the opposite direction to that in the mutant (Fig. 5, A and B). The sodium-dependent glutamate-induced currents in the wild type reflect the sum of the non-reversing coupled currents and the anion currents which reverse at around –30 mV (20.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). A reduction of the external sodium concentration is expected to decrease the size of the coupled current as well as the contribution of the reversing anion current, thereby shifting the reversal potential of the summed current to more positive values. The shift of the reversal potential of the mutant with sodium is probably not solely determined by the altered driving force, but is also likely to be influenced to some extent by the fact that sodium itself enables glutamate to induce the currents. When the external potassium concentration is increased, the otherwise bi-directional currents mediated by wild type are now exclusively inward at all potentials (Fig. 5D). This can also be easily explained in the framework of the model presented in Fig. 7. At negative potentials, the glutamate-elicited inward currents mediated by wild type result from its clockwise progression through the cycle. Increasing the external potassium concentration in the presence of glutamate (which are the conditions of the experiment in Fig. 5D) will increase the probability that potassium rather than glutamate will bind to State I. Because their binding is mutually exclusive, the transporter counter will be brought clockwise into State VI (Fig. 7), and the glutamate-elicited inward current will be diminished. At positive potentials, the elevated potassium concentration gives rise to outward current because of reverse transport (15.Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 17.Kanner B.I. Bendahan A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6327-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 37.Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hebert S.C. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16561-16568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) taking place during the counter-clockwise progression from Step 6 to Step 1 (Fig. 7). These outward currents are decreased when glutamate is added to the outside, again because of the mutually exclusive binding of potassium and glutamate. Subtracting the currents in the absence of external glutamate (smaller inward current and larger outward current) from those in its presence (larger inward current and smaller outward current) yields the inward currents shown for wild type (Fig. 5D). Two types of uncoupling have been inferred in ion-coupled transporters. In one type there is a defect in the sequential binding of the driving ion and the driven substrate, whereas in the other, the binding sites are simultaneously accessible from either side of the membrane. An example of the first case is provided by the bacterial multidrug/proton exchanger EmrE, in which glutamate-14 is involved in the sequential binding of the proton and the positively charged drug (38.Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mutating glutamate-14 to aspartate decreases the apparent proton affinity and results in a decreased ability of the proton to release the drug (38.Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5264-5269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The second case has been suggested to occur in mutants of the proton-coupled lactose permease that exhibit a constitutive proton-leak, which can be blocked by substrate (39.King S.C. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9645-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in mutants in which the substrate elicits a proton-leakage (40.Matzke E.A. Stephenson L.J. Brooker R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19095-19100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This latter scenario is phenotypically similar to the R445S mutant. Importantly however, a significant novel feature of our study is that the determinant, which causes glutamate to open both gates simultaneously, may be close to its binding site. Arginine 447, close to the arginine 445 investigated here, has been inferred as a binding residue of the glutamate γ-carboxyl group (27.Bendahan A. Armon A. Madani N. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies show that, when the cysteine occupying the equivalent position of arginine 447 in the neutral amino acid transporter 2, is replaced by arginine, the transporter is converted into an acidic amino acid transporter. 2N. Madani, A. Bendahan, B. I. Kanner, and M. P. Kavanaugh, unpublished data. In addition, in the neutral amino acid transporter 1, threonine occupies the equivalent position and its substrate specificity can be converted into that of the neutral amino acid transporter 2 by replacing it with cysteine, and vice versa. 2N. Madani, A. Bendahan, B. I. Kanner, and M. P. Kavanaugh, unpublished data. Thus, even though a crystal structure of a glutamate transporter is not yet available, there is strong evidence that position 447 of EAAC1 is indeed part of the substrate-binding site. Arginine 445 is uniquely positioned (only two residues away) to modulate glutamate-dependent gating. Thus, the substrate-binding site and one of the gates, or a residue controlling the gating process, are in close physical proximity. The Vmax and Km values of transport by the R445S mutant are greatly reduced compared with wild type. As the Km is the composite of the several rate constants associated with various steps, one possibility is that a rate-constant associated with a step subsequent to binding is lowered in this mutant. Indeed, it could be decreased to such an extent that the affected step becomes rate-limiting for the transport cycle, thus causing the observed reduction in Vmax. In contrast to wild type, the maximum substrate-elicited currents (Imax) mediated by the R445S mutant vary with the substrate (Fig. 1), and the major part of this current is uncoupled (Figs. 5 and 6). One attractive possibility is that l-glutamate, l-aspartate, and d-aspartate differ in their residency times at State III (Fig. 7). As long as the substrate resides in its binding site, the uncoupled flux continues, and its magnitude will vary according to how long it remains bound. Another possibility is that the substrate-binding pocket is physically linked to the gating mechanism, and the different dimensions of the substrates influence the rate by which the outer gate can close. The net outward substrate-dependent currents mediated by other mutants where arginine 445 has been changed to an uncharged residue are also not carried by chloride (Figs. 2 and 4). Therefore, it appears that, in the absence of a positive charge at position 445, gating is impaired concomitant with differences in the maximal substrate-elicited currents (Figs. 1 and 3). It is not clear, however, why a positive charge at position 445, which is highly conserved in the glutamate transporter family is essential for optimal gating. One possibility is that glutamate binding causes the arginine at position 445 to move, thereby enabling it to interact physically with a negatively charged amino acid residue. The formation of such a salt bridge could induce closure of the outer gate directly, but it is also possible that this occurs by means of an indirect conformational change. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved negatively charged residues, in conjunction with the type of experimental approach used here, may shed further light on the molecular mechanism of ion-coupled transporters.

In mice, CBFα regulates the expression of ELA2, suggesting a common link for both diseases. However, gene-targeted mouse models have failed to reproduce either human disease, thus prohibiting further in vivo studies in mice. Here we investigate CBFα regulation of the human ELA2 promoter, taking advantage of bone marrow obtained from patients with either illness. In particular, we have identified novel ELA2 promoter substitutions (-199 C to A) within a potential motif for lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (LEF-1), a transcriptional mediator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, in SCN patients. The LEF-1 motif lies adjacent to a potential CBFα binding site that is in a different position in human compared with mouse ELA2. We find that LEF-1 and CBFα co-activate ELA2 expression. In vitro, the high mobility group domain of LEF-1 interacts with the runt DNA binding and proline-, serine-, threonine-rich activation domains of CBFα. ELA2 transcript levels are up-regulated in bone marrow of an SCN patient with the -199 C to A substitution. Conversely, a mutation of the CBFα activation domain, found in a patient with familial platelet disorder with AML, fails to stimulate the ELA2 promoter in vitro, and bone marrow correspondingly demonstrates reduced ELA2 transcript. Observations in these complementary patients indicate that LEF-1 cooperates with CBFα to activate ELA2 in vivo and also suggest the possibility that up-regulating promoter mutations can contribute to SCN. Two hereditary AML predisposition syndromes may therefore intersect via LEF-1, potentially linking them to more generalized cancer mechanisms.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4717-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 23.Nuchprayoon I. Simkevich C.P. Luo M. Friedman A.D. Rosmarin A.G. Blood. 1997; 89: 4546-4554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts to model these two leukemia syndromes in mice have failed, however. Knock-in mice targeted with an SCN-causing human ELA2 mutation demonstrate normal hematopoiesis (24.Grenda D.S. Johnson S.E. Mayer J.R. McLemore M.L. Benson K.F. Horwitz M. Link D.C. Blood. 2002; 100: 3221-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Knock-out mice targeted for heterozygous disruption of AML1 also lack thrombocytopenia, platelet abnormalities, and leukemia (25.Okuda T. van Deursen J. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing J.R.

A possible explanation for the shortcomings of the mouse models is that there may be differences in transcriptional control of hematopoiesis. In particular, a CBFα binding site does not appear conserved at the corresponding position in the human neutrophil elastase (hELA2) promoter, and there is evidence for the involvement only of PU.1 (28.Srikanth S. Rado T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and C/EBP (29.Verbeek W. Gombart A.F. Chumakov A.M. Muller C. Friedman A.D. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not c-Myb (30.Friedman A.D. Int. J. Hematol. 2002; 75: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To define the regulation of the hELA2 promoter in vivo toward the goal of investigating a potential transcriptional linkage between these two leukemic syndromes, we here utilize bone marrow from patients with these two diseases. One sample comes from an SCN patient demonstrating a novel ELA2 promoter sequence substitution, whereas the other derives from a FPD/AML patient with an AML1 activation domain mutation. We find that CBFα directly interacts with lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (LEF-1). LEF-1 is an effector of Wnt signaling (31.Moon R.T. Bowerman B. Boutros M. Perrimon N. Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), a pathway entrenched in cancer mechanisms. The cooperative activation of ELA2 by LEF-1 and CBFα suggests that there may be a common link between both syndromes that may, in turn, connect them to more general cancer mechanisms. Patients—Bone marrow aspirates from patients and controls, subjected to Institutional Review Board-approved protocols, represent discarded portions of samples obtained for routine care. The -199 C to A ELA2 substitution appears in two SCN cases. One is an 11-year-old girl with SCN presenting at age 4 years following recurrent gingivitis. She died after bone marrow transplant at age 12 years. A 2-year-old brother died of SCN-related sepsis. Her mother lacked this ELA2 variant. Samples from the father and brother were not available. The other is a 46-year-old man, diagnosed at age 40 following years of recurrent aphthous stomatitis; other family members were unavailable. Mutations in other known and candidate SCN genes, including Gfi1, were not detected in either SCN patient. IV:2/pedigree 3 of Michaud et al. (47.Michaud J. Wu F. Osato M. Cotties G.M. Yanagida M.

Bone marrow was aspirated during first complete remission, when blood cell counts were normal. Vectors and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Human and mouse ELA2 promoters were PCR-amplified from peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA and subcloned into the pGL3 firefly luciferase reporter (Promega). Human LEF-1HA, dnLEF-1HA, and pt-β-catenin expression constructs have been described (32.Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar, 33.Takemaru K.I. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Human CBFα and CBFβ pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) expression vectors were gifts of Dr. H. Scott (Walter and Eliza Hall Institute). cDNA encoding human PU.1, C/EBPϵ, and c-Myb were reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-amplified from HL-60 cells and subcloned into PCS2+ expression vectors (34.Li F.Q. Horwitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14230-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). LEF-1 cDNA was subcloned into pCS2+ for in vitro transcription/translation. Mutagenesis with oligonucleotide cassettes was used to construct ELA2 promoter and LEF-1 and CBFα mutations. LEF-1 and CBFα mutants were subcloned into PCDNA3.1 expression vector. pET-23b expression vector (Novagen) was used to generate His-tagged LEF-1 and CBFα. Cell Lines and Cultivation—HEK293T, HeLa, NIH-3T3, U-937, KG-1, and HL-60 cells were purchased from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (first three) or RPMI plus 12.5% fetal bovine serum (latter three). RT-PCR and Real Time PCR Analysis—RNA was isolated from bone marrow with QIAamp and from cell culture with RNeasy (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed with TaqMan Gold (ABI) using random priming (or oligo(dT), as indicated) for 25 or 40 cycles, as noted. Real time PCR was performed using the ABI 7900HT system in a 50-μl volume for 40 cycles: 50 °C for 2 min; 95 °C for 10 min; 95 °C for 0.15 min; 60 °C for 1 min with 5′-FAM/3′-BHQ-1 ELA2 probe and VIC glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) control probe. ELA2 transcript was normalized to GAPDH using the standard curve method (manufacturer's protocol). Expression analysis of LEF/TCF factors used specific human primers with oligo(dT)-primed cDNA for 30 PCR cycles to produce products of the indicated sizes: LEF-1, 251 bp; TCF-1, 247 bp; TCF-3, 250 bp; TCF-4, 264 bp. Transient Expression of Recombinant Proteins and Luciferase Assay—For luciferase assays, 2 × 105 or 4 × 105 cells were seeded per well into 12- or 6-well tissue culture dishes, respectively, cultured overnight, and then transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) with 1 or 2 μg of DNA (unless stated otherwise), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK; Promega) was co-transfected as an internal control, and the firefly activities were normalized to Renilla activity. In 12-well dish transfections, a total of 1 μg of the tested activators, 50 ng of reporter and 5 ng of pRL-TK were used (unless stated otherwise), and quantities per well were doubled for 6-well plates. Luminometry (Berthold Technologies) scored luciferase activity 24 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase assay (Promega). Transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated three times, and S.E. was reported. Empty vector was added to normalize the total amount of DNA in every transfection, and each transfection was performed in triplicate. 0.1 μg of the 260-bp ELA2 promoter were used as luciferase reporter in all of the assays (unless stated otherwise). Recombinant Protein Expression—His6-tagged LEF-1 and CBFα were produced in Escherichia coli. cDNAs were subcloned into pET-23b (Novagen) and expressed in the pLysS strain with nickel affinity chromatography purification. In vitro transcription/translation was performed using TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate (Promega) with or without [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and in Vitro Association Assay—Transiently co-transfected cells were lysed in 400 μl of iced lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 135 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), followed by 3-s sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, adjusted for protein concentration, and incubated with 2 μg of goat polyclonal anti-CBFα antiserum (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rat monoclonal anti-hemagglutin (anti-HA) antiserum (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C overnight with rotation, followed by the addition of 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) with 1 h of further incubation. Immunoprecipitates were centrifuged and washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer. 20 μl of loading buffer were added to the drained beads and then resolved by SDS-PAGE with immunoblot detection using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The concentrations of antibodies for immunoblot were as follows: 3 μg/ml mouse monoclonal antibody to human LEF-1 (REMB1, Exalpha Biologicals); 1:300 C-19; 1:5,000 mouse monoclonal antibody to GAPDH (6C5; Biodesign International); 1:1,000 anti-HA; 1:2,000 mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antiserum (Sigma). Secondary detection employed 1:10,000 peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) reactive to the primary antibody. In vitro association assays used 25 μl of vector-programmed TNT extract. 35S-Labeled CBFα- or LEF-1-HA-containing extracts were mixed with unlabeled LEF-1 or CBFα extracts with or without CBFβ. Antibodies against HA or CBFα were added with rotation overnight at 4 °C. 20 μl of protein G beads (Sigma) were added and rotated for 1 h, and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE with autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—1 μg (unless stated otherwise) of nickel affinity-purified, bacterially expressed His-tagged LEF-1 or CBFα was mixed with 1 ng of 32P-5′-radiolabeled annealed double-stranded oligonucleotide probe in an equal volume of 2× buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)), incubated for 30 min on ice, and then electrophoresed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. Competitive oligonucleotides, at indicated excess, were added 5 min before probe, and antibody was added 30 min before probe. For titration experiments, shifted bands were excised from dried gels and subject to scintillation counting. Antisense Morpholino Oligonucleotide Knockdown—LEF-1, AML1, or scrambled sequence control antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (GeneTools) were transfected to HL-60 or U937 cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. 17 h later, cells were extracted, and NE activity was assayed (34.Li F.Q. Horwitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14230-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed as described (35.Duan Z. Horwitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5932-5937Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) using U937 cells. 1 μg of mouse monoclonal antibody to human LEF-1 (REMB1) or goat polyclonal antibody to CBFα (N-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to precipitate protein-DNA complexes. About 5 ng of immunoprecipitated DNA served as a template in each reaction in a total volume of 50 μl and corresponded to about 1:10,000 to 1:20,000 of the genomic DNA isolated from 1.5 ml of soluble chromatin. ELA2 Promoter Substitutions in SCN—ELA2 mutations affecting the protein sequence cause the majority of SCN cases (7.Dale D.C. Person R.E. Bolyard A.A. Aprikyan A.G. Bos C. Bonilla M.A. Boxer L.A. Kannourakis G. Zeidler C. Welte K. Benson K.F. Horwitz M. Blood. 2000; 96: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); promoter mutations have not previously been sought. In 4 of 41 SCN patients lacking ELA2 coding abnormalities, we identified two different single nucleotide substitutions in the promoter after sequencing ∼300 upstream base pairs. Two patients demonstrate a heterozygous C to A transversion 15 bases upstream of the transcription start site in a potential GC-box for the general transcription factor Sp1 (Fig. 1A). Two other SCN patients possess a heterozygous C to A transversion at position -199, within a potential LEF-1/TCF motif that differs from the consensus only by a G to T transition (Fig. 1A). Neither variant appears in any of 47 SCN patients with ELA2 coding mutations. Among 260 controls, the -15 C to A substitution does not occur. The -199 C to A substitution is present in just one of these controls. SCN is usually a monogenic disorder; however, there is a suggestion that in some circumstances multiple inherited factors might be contributory (2.Horwitz M. Li F.-Q. Albani D. Duan Z. Person R. Meade-White K. Benson K.F. Cancer Invest. 2003; 21: 577-585Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the greatly elevated frequency of promoter variants among individuals with SCN suggests that these variants may contribute to disease risk. Regardless of their potential contributions to disease, these variants afford an opportunity to investigate ELA2 transcriptional regulation in vivo. Elevated ELA2 Expression in an SCN Patient with the Potential LEF/TCF Binding Site Substitution—To determine whether the -199 C to A substitution affects ELA2 expression, we performed RT-PCR (Fig. 1B) and real time RT-PCR (Fig. 1C) on bone marrow obtained from one of these SCN patients. The ELA2 transcript shows an over 4-fold increase in the SCN patient compared with two normal controls. These results suggest that the -199 C to A substitution found in the LEF-1/TCF binding site of the ELA2 promoter up-regulates expression. LEF-1 Expression in Myeloid Lineages—LEF-1, a LEF/TCF transcription factor family member, is a terminal component of the canonical Wnt pathway (31.Moon R.T. Bowerman B. Boutros M. Perrimon N. Science. 2002; 296: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The Wnt family of secreted proteins regulates intercellular interactions by binding a cell surface receptor, a Frizzled family member, which, in the canonical pathway, relays the signal through the cytoplasm to stabilize β-catenin protein levels. β-Catenin translocates to the nucleus and forms a complex with LEF/TCF, thereby transcriptionally activating or repressing target genes. The name of LEF-1 derives from its isolation from lymphocytes (36.van de Wetering M. de Lau W. Clevers H. Cell. 2002; 109: 13-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), but expression of LEF/TCF family members (37.Thiele A. Wasner M. Muller C. Engeland K. Hauschildt S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6786-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and β-catenin (38.Chung E.J. Hwang S.G. Nguyen P. Lee S. Kim J.S. Kim J.W. Henkart P.A. Bottaro D.P. Soon L. Bonvini P. Lee S.J. Karp J.E. Oh H.J. Rubin J.S. Trepel J.B. Blood. 2002; 100: 982-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) also occurs (at least) in monocytes. Given elevated ELA2 expression in the SCN patient with an altered potential LEF/TCF binding site, we tested for the expression of these factors in myelocytic cells. RT-PCR confirms expression of transcripts encoding LEF-1 and TCF-3, but neither TCF-1 nor TCF-4, in human bone marrow (Fig. 1D) and LEF-1 expression (Fig. 1E) in human HL-60 promyelocytes (39.Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) and U-937 promonocytes (40.Nilsson K. Sundstrom C. Int. J. Cancer. 1974; 13: 808-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), both of which (8.Bieth J.G. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 54-60Google Scholar) express ELA2. (Immunoblot analysis also confirms expression of LEF-1 in HL-60 cells, shown below in Fig. 3A.) We therefore have focused on LEF-1 as probably contributing to the transcriptional effects of the -199 C to A ELA2 promoter substitution. β-Catenin-independent Enhancer Function of the Potential LEF-1 Element—We addressed whether the potential LEF-1 binding site contributes to in vitro ELA2 promoter activity by constructing derivative ELA2 promoters, containing either 560 or 260 bp of the upstream regulatory region, driving a luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2A). We assayed activity in transiently transfected HEK293T kidney cells, commonly used to investigate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, with or without co-transfection of a LEF-1 expression vector. As shown in Fig. 2B, LEF-1 stimulates the wild type ELA2 promoter (NEP260WT). In contrast, reporters containing a deletion (NEP260ΔLEF-1) or substitutions (NEP260LEF-1BM) within the LEF-1 binding site only weakly react to LEF-1, confirming that this sequence functions as a LEF-1-responsive element in vitro. (Assays in HeLa and NIH-3T3 cells produced similar results (not shown).) TCF-3 also activated the expression of ELA2 (data not shown). Wnt signaling can proceed through noncanonical β-catenin-independent pathways (41.Kuhl M. Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 279-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), and LEF-1 can activate transcription independently of β-catenin (42.Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 43.Eastman Q. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). To determine whether β-catenin influences ELA2 transactivation, we tested the effects of pt-β-catenin, a stabilized form in which four aminoterminal serine and threonine residues are substituted with alanines (44.Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Co-expression of pt-β-catenin and LEF-1 did not significantly increase reporter activity (Fig. 2B). A dominant negative form of LEF-1 (dnLEF-1) lacking the β-catenin binding domain stimulated the ELA2 promoter as efficiency as the full-length pt-β-catenin (data not shown), indicating that LEF-1 activates the ELA2 promoter largely independently of β-catenin. Elevated ELA2 Expression with the -199 C to A Substitution in HEK293T Cells—To determine whether the effect of the -199 C to A ELA2 substitution can be reproduced in vitro, we prepared reporters containing this substitution fused with either 560 bp (NEP560C>A) or 260 bp (NEP260C>A) of the upstream regulatory region (Fig. 2A). This substitution confers increased transcription upon both lengths of sequence in HEK293T cells, whereas there is no significant difference in the basal level (Fig. 2C). The effect is not as strong as what is apparent in the bone marrow of the SCN patient with the corresponding sequence change. There are at least two reasons for this difference. First, the reporter may not include all upstream elements required for co-activation of the more proximal promoter region present in the reporters. Second, HEK293T cells, derived from kidney, are unlikely to express an appropriate repertoire of co-activating transcription factors. Nevertheless, we can conclude that the elevated ELA2 transcription in bone marrow from an individual with this substitution probably results from this single base substitution, as opposed to the possibility of an undetected, additional DNA sequence change outside of the boundaries of the region that we examined. LEF-1 Binding in Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—To corroborate the function of the LEF-1 binding site in the ELA2 promoter, we carried out EMSAs employing recombinant LEF-1 (Fig. 2D). The probes consisted of 32P-5′-labeled doublestranded oligonucleotides spanning the region from -210 to -176 of the ELA2 promoter, corresponding to either the wild type sequence or the -199 C to A substitution. Fig. 2D shows that LEF-1 forms a retarded complex with the wild type sequence (compare lane 1 with lane 4). Anti-LEF-1 antibody (lane 3), but not control IgG (lane 2), supershifts the retarded complex. LEF-1 therefore binds specifically to the sequence found in the ELA2 promoter. LEF-1 also binds specifically to a probe containing the -199 C to A substitution (lane 10). When the cold -199 C to A substituted probe"

Replacement of Lys532 with either arginine or alanine has essentially no effect on the sequence preference of the enzyme, indicating that this interaction is not required for the preference for a T at the -1 position. Although both the cleavage and religation activities of the K532R mutant enzyme are reduced, cleavage is reduced to a greater extent than religation. The reverse is true for the K532A mutant enzyme with religation so impaired that the nicked intermediate accumulates during plasmid relaxation assays. Consistent with the shift in the cleavage religation equilibrium toward cleavage for the K532A mutant enzyme, expression of the mutant enzyme in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is cytotoxic, and thus this mutant enzyme mimics the effects of the anticancer drug camptothecin. Cleavage assays with the mutant enzymes using an oligonucleotide containing a 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate indicate that Lys532 functions as a general acid during cleavage to protonate the leaving 5′-oxygen. It is possible that the contact with the -1 base is important during catalysis to provide positional rigidity to the active site.

DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that solve topological problems generated by key nuclear processes such as DNA replication, transcription, recombination, DNA repair, chromatin assembly, and chromosome segregation by catalyzing the passage of individual DNA strands or double helices through one another. All cells contain two highly conserved classes of topoisomerases that are differentiated on the basis of their mechanistic and physical properties. The monomeric type I enzymes do not require high energy cofactors to change the helical state of DNA. They create a transient nick in one DNA strand through which the complementary strand is passed, leading to DNA relaxation (1.Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 2.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). The type II enzymes are multisubunit proteins that require ATP and modulate DNA topology by passing an intact helix through a transient double-strand break they create in the same or different DNA (3.Wang J.C. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). All type II topoisomerases and the type IA subfamily form transient covalent phosphodiester bonds with the 5′-end of broken DNA strands, whereas the type IB topoisomerases form a transient linkage to the 3′-end of the DNA (2.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). The type IB topoisomerase subfamily includes eukaryotic topoisomerase I, the topoisomerases encoded by vaccinia and other poxviruses, and some newly identified bacterial enzymes (1.Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 4.Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently, a structure of human topoisomerase I with a bound 22-bp DNA has been solved by x-ray crystallography (5.Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 6.Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Human topoisomerase I is a monomeric protein of 765 amino acids that binds to double-stranded DNA in a “clamp”-like manner with a preference for supercoiled DNA (7.Madden K.R. Stewart L. Champoux J.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5399-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both negative and positive supercoils can be relaxed without a requirement for a high energy cofactor such as ATP. The reaction involves nucleophilic attack of Tyr723 on a phosphodiester bond in the DNA, resulting in temporary breakage of one DNA strand and covalent attachment of the active site tyrosine to the 3′-phosphate at the nick. Based on information gained from the structure of the topoisomerase I-DNA complex, relaxation likely takes place by a rotational mechanism (6.Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Religation is mechanistically similar to strand breakage, with the 5′-hydroxyl at the nick acting as the nucleophile to religate the DNA strand and release the enzyme. The covalent intermediate between topoisomerase I and DNA is normally quite transient, i.e. strand religation is fast relative to strand cleavage. However, in the presence of the topoisomerase I-specific poison camptothecin (CPT), 1The abbreviations used are: CPT, camptothecin; topo70, NH2-terminal truncation of human topoisomerase I missing first 174 amino acids; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; WT, wild type; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. the rejoining step is slowed significantly, resulting in topoisomerase I being trapped in a covalent complex with DNA (8.Hsiang Y.H.

In fact, the double-strand breaks resulting from a collision of a replication fork with the drug-trapped topoisomerase I are the predominant cytotoxic mechanism of this anti-cancer drug as evidenced by the protective effect of DNA synthesis inhibitors (9.Ryan A.J. Squires S. Strutt H.L. Evans A. Johnson R.T. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10.Holm C. Covey J.M. Kerrigan D. Pommier Y.

Addition of the protein denaturant SDS to a topoisomerase I reaction in vitro traps the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. This technique has proven useful for the determination of topoisomerase I cleavage sites on linear double-stranded DNA. The following weak consensus sequence was observed for the bases at positions -4 to -1 where cleavage occurs between the -1 and +1 positions, and the enzyme becomes attached covalently to the -1 nucleotide: (-4) A/T, (-3) G/C/A, (-2) T/A, and (-1) T (12.Been M.D. Burgess R.R. Champoux J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3097-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 13.Parker L.H. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 6-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The basis for this weak sequence preference of topoisomerase I has not been determined, but a close examination of the crystal structure of human topoisomerase I bound to DNA reveals a possible mechanism (5.Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 6.Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Among the numerous interactions between the enzyme and its DNA substrate, only one residue makes a base-specific contact with the DNA. This contact is between the side chain amino group of Lys532 and the O-2 atom of the -1 thymine base. An analogous interaction between Lys532 and the -1 position on the DNA was observed in a crystal structure of human topoisomerase I with a DNA substrate that contains a cytosine at the -1 position, the next most preferred nucleotide at this position (12.Been M.D. Burgess R.R. Champoux J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3097-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14.Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The fact that both pyrimidine bases interact with Lys532 through the O-2 raises the question of whether Lys532 might be important for the nucleotide preference of the enzyme at the -1 position. The type IB topoisomerases share a common chemistry and three-dimensional structure with the tyrosine recombinases that include phage P1 Cre and Escherichia coli XerD recombinases, as well as the Int family of phage integrases (5.Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 15.Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The hallmark of the type IB topoisomerases and the tyrosine recombinases is an active site that consists of two arginines, one histidine, and the nucleophilic tyrosine (1.Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 16.Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Ellenberger T. Landy A.

A fifth essential catalytic residue, a lysine, has been identified biochemically in the XerD protein from Salmonella typhimurium (19.Cao Y. Hayes F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Flp (20.Chen Y. Rice P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24800-24807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and in vaccinia topoisomerase (Lys167) (21.Petersen B.O. Wittschieben J. Shuman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The equivalent residue in human topoisomerase I is Lys532. This lysine residue is conserved among type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases with an occasional conservative substitution of arginine at the corresponding position. Evidence has been presented that Lys167 in vaccinia topoisomerase acts as a general acid to protonate the leaving 5′-oxygen during the cleavage reaction (22.Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). More recently Arg130 in the vaccinia enzyme has also been implicated in expulsion of the leaving group (23.Krogh B.O. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5711-5714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To investigate further the role of Lys532 in catalysis by human topoisomerase I and in the sequence preference of the enzyme, we replaced Lys532 with alanine and, more conservatively, with arginine and analyzed the effects of these changes in vitro and in vivo. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutant alleles of the NH2-terminally truncated human topoisomerase I (topo70) were generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The PCRs were performed on plasmid pGST-topo70 (24.Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), using the following primer pairs to generate pGST-topo70K532R: K532Rforward (5′-GACTTCCTCGGGAGGGACTCCATCAG) and K532Rreverse (5′-CTGATGGAGTCCCTCCCGAGGAAGTC). K532Aforward (5′-GAGTTTGACTTCCTCGGCGCCGACTCCATCAGATAC) and K532Areverse (5′-GTATCTGATGGAGTCGGCGCCGAGGAAGTCAAACTC) were used to create pGST-topo70K532A. The changed bases are underlined. The introduction of these mutations was monitored by the disappearance of an EcoNI site and was verified by sequencing. To introduce these mutations into the baculovirus system, plasmid pFastBac1-topo70 H632Q (25.Yang Z. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 677-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) that contains the topo70 coding region was digested with NheI/partially HindIII. The excised 521-bp NheI/HindIII fragment was replaced with the corresponding fragments from pGST-topo70 K532R and pGST-topo70 K532A containing the introduced mutations and restoring H632Q to WT. The resulting plasmids pFastBac1-topo70 K532R and pFastBac1-topo70 K532A were then used according to the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system instruction manual (Invitrogen) to integrate the mutated human topoisomerase I coding sequences into the bacmid in E. coli DH10BAC cells. Correct integration of topoisomerase I into the bacmid was verified by PCR. The topoisomerase I double mutant K532R/Y723F was generated by replacing the 1.5-kb EcoRI/NheI fragment of pFastBac1-topo70 K532R with the equivalent fragment from pFastBac1-topo70 Y723F, thus creating plasmid pFastBac1-topo70 K532R/Y723F. pFastBac1-topo70 Y723F was generated by replacing the EcoRI/NheI fragment from pFastBac1-topo70 (25.Yang Z. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 677-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with the equivalent fragment from pGST-topo70 Y723F (24.Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—The recombinant topoisomerase I proteins (WT, K532R, K532A, and K532R/Y723F) were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells (Invitrogen). To generate recombinant baculovirus particles, bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf9 cells according to the Bac-to-Bac expression system manual. The expression of the topo70 proteins was verified by immunoblotting. The procedures for baculovirus amplification, expression of topoisomerase I, and purification of the overexpressed proteins were performed as described previously (26.Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Plasmid Relaxation Assay—Supercoiled plasmid pBluescript KSII(+) (Stratagene) was used in the plasmid relaxation assays. These assays were performed essentially as described previously (26.Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All plasmid relaxation experiments were performed in a reaction buffer containing 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin per ml. For the dilution experiment (Fig. 2A), proteins were serially diluted 2-fold in reaction buffer, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of the indicated amounts of the enzyme to a 15-μl sample containing 0.5 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 5× loading dye (2.5% SDS, 10% Ficoll, 50 mm EDTA, 0.125% bromphenol blue). The samples were then treated for 30 min at 37 °C with proteinase K (40 μg/ml) to remove topoisomerase I protein from any covalent complexes that were present. After electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel in TBE (89 mm Tris borate, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8), the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml TBE), briefly rerun to separate the relaxed and nicked plasmid DNAs, and the DNA visualized with UV illumination. The time course assays were performed under the same conditions with the amounts of protein indicated in the figure legends. Equilibrium Cleavage Assay—The 25-mer oligonucleotide CL25 (Fig. 3A) was 32P-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to the complementary 25-mer CP25. Reaction mixtures containing 150 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10 nm oligonucleotide substrate CL25/CP25 were incubated at room temperature (23 °C), and reactions were started by the addition of enzyme (200 nm). At the indicated time points, 20-μl samples were removed and the reactions stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 2% SDS. Half of these mixtures were added to 10 μl of protein sample loading buffer (156 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 25% glycerol, 12.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.0025% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and 7 μl of each sample were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. To the second half of the reaction, 2 μl of 0.1 m MgCl2 and 85 μl of ethanol were added to precipitate the DNA and the proteins that are covalently bound to it. The pellets were resuspended in 7 μl of 1.5 mg/ml trypsin and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were then mixed with 15 μl of formamide loading dye (96% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.03% xylene cyanol, 0.03% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 3 min, and 6-μl aliquots were analyzed by denaturing 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel electrophoresis (sequencing gel). Image retrieval and quantitation were carried out using a PhosphorImager in conjunction with the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Suicide Cleavage Assays—The suicide cleavage assays were performed under conditions identical to those used for the equilibrium cleavage assays using as substrates CL14/CP25 (Fig. 4A) or CL22-S/CP22 (Fig. 5A). The 14-mer CL14 or the 22-mer CL22-S were 5′-32P-end-labeled and annealed to the complementary 25-mer CP25 or the 22-mer CP22, respectively, both of which had been cold-phosphorylated at their 5′-ends. Reactions were stopped with SDS and analyzed by both SDS-PAGE and sequencing gel electrophoresis as described above. The ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) was used for quantitation.Fig. 5Suicide cleavage using a 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate containing DNA oligonucleotide. A, the structure of the 5′-32P-end-labeled CL22-S/CP22 oligonucleotide substrate containing a 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate linkage (-OPS-) is indicated with the cleavage site marked with an arrow. B, WT and the K532A and K532R mutant enzymes were incubated with the suicide substrate CL22-S/CP22 for the indicated times, and the reactions were stopped with SDS. The amount of covalent complex was quantified after analyzing the product by SDS-PAGE using the PhosphorImager. The data shown here are representative of a total of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Religation Assay—The same labeled CL25/CP25 substrate and reactions that were used in the equilibrium cleavage assays were also used in the religation assay. WT and K532R were incubated with the substrate for 10 min to ensure that equilibrium had been reached. K532A was incubated for2hto accumulate enough covalent complex that could easily be visualized by SDS-PAGE. At the 0 time point, NaCl was added to the reactions to a final concentration of 500 mm to prevent rebinding of topoisomerase I to the DNA after religation. Religation was stopped by the addition of SDS, and the samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE and sequencing gels as described for the cleavage assays. Yeast Experiment—The yeast shuttle vector pHT-100 (27.Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by O. Westergaard, allowed galactose-dependent topoisomerase I expression. It is a CEN/ARS plasmid that contains the GAL1-10 promoter linked to the full-length human topoisomerase I gene with URA3 as a selectable marker. To generate pHT-100-K532A, the 859-bp SphI/NheI fragment of pHT-100 was replaced with the corresponding fragment from pFastBac1-topo70K532A. pHT-100 was cut with BamHI to release the entire topoisomerase I sequence on a 3.4-kb fragment and religated to generate the empty vector pHT-100-ΔtopoI. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are the haploid WT strain W303-1a (MATa ade2-1 trp1-1 can1-100 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ura3-1) and the topI null mutant RS190 which is identical to W303-1a plus top1-8::LEU2 (28.Eng W.K. Faucette L. Johnson R.K. Sternglanz R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 755-760PubMed Google Scholar). Both strains were generously provided by R. Sternglanz. The two S. cerevisiae strains were each transformed with plasmids pHT-100-ΔtopoI, pHT-100, and pHT-100-K532A using the lithium acetate method (29.Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). Rich (YPD) and minimal (SD) media were prepared as described (30.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Cold Spring Harbor LaboratoryLaboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). For drop assays, two colonies from each transformation were grown overnight at 30 °C in SD-ura medium with glucose as the carbon source. Cultures were then diluted to an A600 of 1, and 5 μl from each of 10-fold dilutions (100 to 10-3) were spotted on solid SD-ura medium. The plates contained either galactose or glucose as carbon source to activate or repress expression of topoisomerase I from the GAL1-10 promoter, respectively. Plates were incubated at 30 °C, and pictures were taken every day for 4 days. Sequence Specificity—Two different DNA fragments were used to determine the cleavage specificity of different topoisomerase I variants. Plasmid pGEM-3Zf(-) (Promega) was digested with AatII and NdeI, and the 249-bp fragment was gel-purified. The NdeI end was labeled by a fill-in reaction using T4 DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dATP plus the other three unlabeled dNTPs. After heat inactivation of the polymerase, the fragment was cleaved with BspHI to leave a 233-bp 3′end-labeled fragment. Following purification by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the substrate was resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA). Reactions (final volume 10 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide, ∼1 ng of labeled DNA fragment, and 100 ng of the indicated topoisomerase I enzyme (25 ng at the lower WT concentration), with or without 50 μm CPT. CPT was freshly diluted from a frozen 10 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide. After the indicated incubation times (30 min or 4 h) at 23 °C, 1 μl of 6% SDS was added in order to induce topoisomerase I-mediated DNA breakage. The samples were ethanol-precipitated, and the pellets were resuspended in 7 μl of 1 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. 15 μl of formamide loading dye were added to the samples, and 6.5-μl samples were analyzed on a 6% sequencing gel. The AG ladder was prepared using the Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reaction (31.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1993Google Scholar), and the T ladder was generated using KMnO4 oxidation (32.Holstege F.C. Timmers H.T. Methods. 1997; 12: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, both ladders were treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to generate 5′-hydroxyl ends. The second DNA fragment was derived from the plasmid pBendWest as described previously (24.Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 141-bp 3′-end-labeled NheI/MluI fragment contains the high affinity topoisomerase I cleavage site that was also present on the oligonucleotide substrates CL14 and CL25 (33.Bonven B.J. Gocke E. Westergaard O. Cell. 1985; 41: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The experiment was performed as described above for the pGEM-3Zf fragment. Protein Crystallization—Crystals of the human topo70 K532R/Y723F protein in complex with a 22-mer duplex DNA oligonucleotide used in previous structural studies (6.Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) were grown by vapor diffusion at room temperature. The drops, containing equal volumes of 48 mm topo70 K532R/Y723F-DNA solution and the reservoir (15% PEG 3350 monomethyl ether, 200 mm MgCl2, 100 mm MES, pH 7.5, and 2 mm TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine), yielded crystals within 1 week. Crystals grew to ∼100 × 100 × 30 μm and were flash-frozen in a cryoprotectant of artificial mother liquor supplemented with 15% ethylene glycol. Structure Determination—Data were collected on beamline 19-BM (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratories, Argonne, IL) and processed with HKL2000 (34.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Initial phases for the topo70 K532R/Y723F-DNA complex were obtained using molecular replacement methods in AMoRe (35.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) with the coordinates of human topo70 Y723F in a non-covalent complex with a 22-bp DNA duplex oligonucleotide (Protein Data Bank code 1A36) (6.Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) as a search model. Further refinement and model building were performed with alternate rounds of REFMAC5 (36.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) and Xtalview (37.McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Mutant Proteins—To determine the biochemical importance of Lys532 in catalysis and sequence selectivity by human topoisomerase I, two mutations were introduced into a 70-kDa form of the WT enzyme (topo70). Topo70 lacks the first 174 NH2-terminal amino acids but retains full enzymatic activity in vitro (26.Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Lys532 was replaced by alanine and more conservatively by arginine; the mutant proteins will be referred to as K532A and K532R, respectively. The mutant enzymes were expressed in insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses and purified according to the procedure published previously (26.Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7593-7601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) for WT topo70. Equal amounts of the proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1). Effects of Lys532 Mutations on Relaxation of Supercoiled DNA—The effect of the introduced mutations on catalysis was first examined by assaying the ability of the purified proteins to relax a supercoiled plasmid substrate (Fig. 2). Serial 2-fold dilutions of the WT and mutant proteins were incubated with 0.5 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA. The K532R enzyme was about 100-fold less active than the WT enzyme (Fig. 2A), but when present at ∼200-fold higher concentration than the WT enzyme exhibited similar reaction kinetics in a time course experiment under otherwise identical conditions (Fig. 2B). The K532A enzyme was at least 500 times less active than the WT enzyme based on the finding that activity is barely detectable even at the highest protein concentration used in the dilution series experiment (Fig. 2A). After prolonged incubation at a high protein concentration, K532A primarily produced nicked circular DNA (Fig. 2B), with very few relaxed molecules. Because the products of the reaction were treated with proteinase K prior to the gel analysis, an increase in nicked circles (containing a proteinase K-resistant peptide) reflects the accumulation of covalent complexes. Thus, the simplest explanation for this observation is that in addition to the overall low relaxing activity, the cleavage religation equilibrium for K532A is markedly shifted toward cleavage. Equilibrium Cleavage Assays—To characterize further the mutant enzymes, the 25-mer duplex oligonucleotide substrate CL25/CP25 (Fig. 3A) containing a preferred topoisomerase I cleavage site (Fig. 3A, arrow labeled 1) was used in an SDS cleavage assay. A secondary cleavage site is also present on this oligonucleotide (Fig. 3, arrow labeled 2). This substrate is identical to the 22-bp DNA substrate that was used to obtain the crystal structu"
https://openalex.org/W2131956504,"The binding of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) to serine proteinases, such as tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), is mediated by the exosite interactions between the surface-exposed variable region-1, or 37-loop, of the proteinase and the distal reactive center loop (RCL) of PAI-1. Although the contribution of such interactions to the inhibitory activity of PAI-1 has been established, the specific mechanistic steps affected by interactions at the distal RCL remain unknown. We have used protein engineering, stopped-flow fluorimetry, and rapid acid quenching techniques to elucidate the role of exosite interactions in the neutralization of tPA, uPA, and β-trypsin by PAI-1. Alanine substitutions at the distal P4′ (Glu-350) and P5′ (Glu-351) residues of PAI-1 reduced the rates of Michaelis complex formation (ka) and overall inhibition (kapp) with tPA by 13.4- and 4.7-fold, respectively, whereas the rate of loop insertion or final acyl-enzyme formation (klim) increased by 3.3-fold. The effects of double mutations on ka, klim, and kapp were small with uPA and nonexistent with β-trypsin. We provide the first kinetic evidence that the removal of exosite interactions significantly alters the formation of the noncovalent Michaelis complex, facilitating the release of the primed side of the distal loop from the active-site pocket of tPA and the subsequent insertion of the cleaved reactive center loop into β-sheet A. Moreover, mutational analysis indicates that the P5′ residue contributes more to the mechanism of tPA inhibition, notably by promoting the formation of a final Michaelis complex.

Christ G. Wojita J. Gulba D. Thromb. Res. 2001; 103: 7-19Google Scholar). This inhibitor also plays a vital role in other physiological processes, including tumor invasion and tissue remodeling (2Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 57: 25-40Google Scholar). PAI-1 belongs to the serpin superfamily, which shares several unique structural features, including a five-stranded β-sheet motif and a flexible reactive center loop (RCL). The conformational changes associated with these structures have been linked to the inhibitory function of PAI-1 (3Carrell R.W. Evans D.L.I. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Notably, the mechanism of inhibition depends on the structural changes accompanying the S (stressed) to R (relaxed) transition that results in complete insertion of the N-terminal (proximal) part of the RCL into β-sheet A as an additional β-strand, s4A. The proteinase, tethered by a covalent bond with the P1 residue of the serpin, is displaced from the initial docking site to the opposite end of the serpin molecule, separating the P1′ and P1 residues by ∼70 Å (10Lawrence D.A.

This mechanism efficiently distorts and inactivates the catalytic triad of the proteinase, stabilizing the serpin-proteinase complex at the acyl-enzyme intermediate stage.Unique to the PAI-1 inhibitory mechanism are the exosite interactions between the surface-exposed variable region-1 (VR1) or 37-loop of tPA and the distal RCL of PAI-1 (13Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Google Scholar, 14Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14580-14585Google Scholar). These interactions are believed to facilitate the rate of formation of Michaelis complex (tPA·PAI-1), although direct evidence for this hypothesis is still lacking (15Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 721-724Google Scholar, 16Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Bassel-Duby R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Several studies have demonstrated the importance of positively charged residues on the VR1 of tPA in the efficient inhibitory activity of PAI-1 (14Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14580-14585Google Scholar, 15Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 721-724Google Scholar, 16Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21423-21426Google Scholar). This loop (residues 294-304: FAKHRRSPGER) was partially disordered in the three crystal structures of the catalytic domain of human tPA, suggesting some degree of flexibility, and was identified as the site of initial contact with the RCL of serpins (13Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Fischer S. Rudolph R. Kohnert U. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 117-135Google Scholar, 18Renatus M. Bode W. Huber R. Sturzebecher J. Prasa D. Fischer S. Kohnert U. Stubbs M.T. J.

Inspection of the amino acid sequence of PAI-1 indicates a small stretch of amino acids (residues 350-355; EEIIMD) in the RCL that contains three negatively charged residues. This region of PAI-1 could provide the complementary side chains necessary to interact with the positively charged VR1 of tPA, thereby enhancing Michaelis complex formation via electrostatic effects (15Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 721-724Google Scholar, 17Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Gerard R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21423-21426Google Scholar). Moreover, a salt bridge interaction between the Arg-304 of tPA and the Glu-350 of PAI-1 has been proposed on the basis of a model, using the x-ray crystal structure of a noncovalent bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor-trypsin complex (15Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 721-724Google Scholar). However, charge reversals of the Glu residues (E350R and E351R) at the distal RCL of PAI-1 only decreased the inhibitory activity against tPA by 1 order of magnitude compared with the 2-order of magnitude change afforded by a similar charge reversal on tPA (i.e. R304E), suggesting that the proposed salt bridge interaction is not the primary determinant of proteinase inhibition (17Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J.H. Sambrook J.F. Gerard R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21423-21426Google Scholar).Scheme 1 illustrates the proposed model of the suicide substrate mechanism for tPA inhibition by PAI-1 (10Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Muhammad S. Day D.E. Kvassman J.-O. Ginsburg D. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5839-5844Google Scholar, 20Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Google Scholar, 21Olson S.T.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Google Scholar). In this scheme, a noncovalent Michaelis complex (EI) is formed during the initial encounter (k1/k-1) of the proteinase (E) with its cognate inhibitor (I). This is followed by a reversible acylation step (k2/k-2) that generates an acyl-enzyme intermediate (E∼I) as a result of scissile bond cleavage. Recently, a rate-limiting displacement of the distal cleaved reactive loop from the proteinase (k3/k-3) was identified (21Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Google Scholar), resulting in formation of an intermediate species (E-I) in which the hinge residue(s) at the proximal RCL (starting with P14) are initially inserted into the “breach region” of β-sheet A (23Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Google Scholar). Loop insertion and translocation of the tethered proteinase result in stabilization of the acyl-enzyme complex (k5 and E-I) by distortion of the catalytic triad (20Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Google Scholar). Alternatively, the kinetically trapped acyl-enzyme can undergo deacylation (k4) in which a free enzyme is regenerated and a cleaved inhibitor (I*) is released (20Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Google Scholar).In the present studies, we clearly demonstrate that the distal reactive loop residues of PAI-1, namely P4′ (Glu-350) and P5′ (Glu-351), are both important to the initial binding step of PAI-1 (Scheme 1), facilitating the fast rate of Michaelis complex formation (ka). Alanine substitutions at these residues significantly reduced ka by 13.4-fold. Consequently, the ratelimiting displacement of the distal loop (k3/k-3) is not hindered by a strong exosite interaction, thereby increasing the limiting rate for loop insertion (klim) by 3.3-fold. This enhancement is presumably due to a destabilized interaction of the distal reactive loop with tPA. Analysis of the contributions of the distal loop residues to the individual steps of the inhibitory mechanism suggests that the P5′ residue is the primary residue involved in the exosite interactions with tPA. This residue, however, contributes less to the mechanism of uPA inhibition. Together, these results indicate that the difference in the inhibitory activity of PAI-1 toward tPA and uPA is due, in part, to the extent of the exosite interactions with these proteinases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Reagents—SpectrozymetPA (CH3SO2-d-HHT-Gly-Arg-pNA) and SpectrozymeUK (Cbo-l-(γ)Glu(α-t-BuO)-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide) were obtained from American Diagnostica, Inc. (Greenwich, CT). S-2222 was obtained from Chromogenix (Milano, Italy). Hi-Trap, heparin-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, desalting column (PD-10), and gel filtration medium (Sephadex G-25) were from Amersham Biosciences. HEPES, EDTA, bovine trypsin, and porcine elastase were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade or better and were available commercially. In the present studies, spectral and kinetic experiments were performed at 25 °C in a buffer system comprising 30 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, unless otherwise noted.Construction, Expression, Purification, and Fluorescent Labeling of Recombinant PAI-1 Variants—The S338C (P9 Cys), E350A (P4′ Ala), E351A (P5′ Ala), and E350A/E351A (P4′/P5′ Ala/Ala) PAI-1 variants or combinations thereof were constructed with the Muta-Gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad) as described (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar, 25Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Google Scholar), with the following mutagenic oligonucleotides: S338C, 5′-1098dGACTATGACAGCTGTACATGAGGAGGCCACCG1067-3′; E350A, 5′-1134dGTCCATGATGATCTCCGCGGGGGCCATGCGGGC1102-3′; E351A, 5′-1134dGTCCATGATGATCGCCTCGGGGGCCATGCGGGC1102-3′; E350A/E351A, 5′-1134dGTCCATGATGATCGCCGCGGGGGCCATGCGGGC1102-3′. The nucleotides that deviate from the wild-type cDNA sequence are underlined. Mutations were validated by DNA sequencing of the entire PAI-1 gene. All mutant and wild-type constructs were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified as previously described (22Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Google Scholar, 26Kvassman J.O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-222Google Scholar). Labeling of single Cys-containing PAI-1 variants (i.e. P9C, E350A/P9C, E351A/P9C, and E350A/E351A/P9C) with iodoacetamido-NBD (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were performed as described, with labeling efficiencies in the range of 1.0-1.3 mol of NBD/mol of PAI-1 variant (27Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Google Scholar). Any latent PAI-1 that was generated from the labeling reaction was separated from its active counterpart by chromatography on immobilized β-anhydrotrypsin as described (23Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Google Scholar). The concentrations of recombinant PAI-1 variants were measured at 280 nm, using an absorption coefficient of 0.93 ml mg-1 cm-1 and an Mr of 43,000 (26Kvassman J.O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-222Google Scholar, 28Vaughan D.E. Declerck P.J. Reilly T.M. Park K. Collen D. Fasman G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1202: 221-229Google Scholar). Activity of each labeled PAI-1 variant was assessed by formation of a covalent complex with a 2-fold molar excess of proteinase and nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis (22Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Google Scholar, 29Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Google Scholar).Functional Activity of PAI-1—The molar fractions of wild-type or mutant PAI-1 capable of inhibiting tPA, uPA, and β-trypsin through formation of stoichiometric complexes (i.e. stoichiometry of inhibition) were determined as described (22Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Google Scholar). Following incubation for 20 min in HEPES buffer containing 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, residual enzyme activity was determined by diluting an aliquot of the reaction into a 100 μm solution of appropriate chromogenic substrate (SpectrozymetPA for tPA, SpectrozymeUK for uPA, and S-2222 for β-trypsin) and monitoring the linear increase in absorbance at 405 nm for 1 min. Stoichiometry of inhibition values were obtained from the extrapolated x intercept of data plotting the residual proteinase activity versus molar ratio of inhibitor/proteinase.Apparent Second-order Rate Constant for the Proteinase-PAI-1 Reaction—The apparent bimolecular rate constants (kapp) for the irreversible inhibition of proteinases by wild-type PAI-1 (wtPAI-1) and exosite mutants of PAI-1 (i.e. E350A, E351A, and E350A/E351A) were determined by a competitive kinetic method with the appropriate chromogenic substrates as previously described (20Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Google Scholar, 21Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D.

Reactions were performed under pseudo-first-order conditions, using the following concentrations: 40-80 nm for PAI-1 variants and 4-8 nm for proteinases. The progress curves for inhibition were monitored at 405 nm and fitted to a single exponential function with a linear component to obtain the pseudo-first-order rate constant, kobs. The second-order rate constant, kapp, was calculated for each proteinase-PAI-1 pair as described (22Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Google Scholar), using the following Km values: 77.9, 40.0, and 38.1 μm for SpectrozymetPA, SpectrozymeUK, and S-2222, respectively (23Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Google Scholar).Association Kinetics of PAI-1-Proteinase Interactions—The secondorder rate constants for the formation of noncovalent Michaelis complexes (ka) between PAI-1 variants and various proteinases were directly determined by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence due to displacement of p-aminobenzamidine (PAB) from the active site of the proteinase (21Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Google Scholar). Fluorescence changes were monitored at 325 nm, using an emission filter (Oriel 51260) with a cut-off below 335 nm. PAI-1 concentrations were increased in the presence of 0.3 μm tPA, 0.1 μm uPA, or 0.2 μm β-trypsin and the following PAB concentrations: 200 μm for tPA, 40 μm for uPA, and 10 μm for β-trypsin. The observed pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs), obtained from single exponential fits to the stopped-flow traces, were plotted against the effective PAI-1 concentration, using the correction factor, 1 + [PAB]/KD, where KD is the dissociation constant for PAB binding to each proteinase. The following KD values were employed for the calculation: 8.5, 154.6, and 15.0 μm for β-trypsin, tPA, and uPA, respectively (18Renatus M. Bode W. Huber R. Sturzebecher J. Prasa D. Fischer S. Kohnert U. Stubbs M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21713-21719Google Scholar, 23Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Google Scholar). The linear dependence of kobs on PAI-1 concentration results in a slope that corresponds to ka.Fluorescence Emission Spectroscopy—Fluorescence measurements were obtained by using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and slit widths of 2.5 and 5 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. The emission spectra of 0.2 μm NBD-labeled PAI-1 variant in HEPES buffer containing 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000 were obtained in the absence and presence of 0.4 μm tPA or uPA. To ensure a complete reaction, PAI-1 samples were incubated with tPA or uPA for 10 min prior to the emission scan. For the reaction with elastase, PAI-1 was incubated with 0.04 μm proteinase for 1 h prior to data acquisition. Fluorescence enhancements were measured as previously described (27Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Google Scholar).Stopped-flow Kinetics of P9-NBD-labeled PAI-1—Stopped-flow fluorimetry was performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV instrument with a thermostated syringe chamber. The fluorescence change accompanying the reaction of NBD-labeled PAI-1 variants with at least a 5-fold molar excess of each proteinase was monitored at 480 nm, using an emission filter (Oriel 51300) with a cut-off below 515 nm (21Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Google Scholar, 22Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Google Scholar, 27Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Google Scholar). As found previously, all stopped-flow traces fit best to a double exponential function, yielding pseudo-first-order rate constants kobs1 and kobs2 (27Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Google Scholar). Of the two rate constants, the faster component (kobs1) yielded the major fluorescence change and was analyzed. The minor contribution of kobs2 to the fluorescence change has been accounted for and discussed elsewhere (21Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Google Scholar, 27Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Google Scholar). The plot of kobsversus proteinase concentration was fitted to an equation that assumes a two-step binding mechanism and is best described by a rectangular hyperbola function: kobs = klim[E]o/(Km + [E]o), where [E]o is the proteinase concentration, klim is the limiting rate constant for the formation of the final inhibited complex (E-I), and Km is the proteinase concentration at which kobs reaches half of klim. Km is defined by the equation (klim + koff)/kon, where kon and koff are the forward and reverse rate constants for the formation and breakdown of Michaelis complex (EI), respectively.Limiting Rate Constant for Formation of the Inhibited Serpin-Proteinase Complex—The rate of formation of the stable tPA·PAI-1 complex was determined by continuous flow rapid acid quenching as previously described (20Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Google Scholar, 22Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Google Scholar). Saturating conditions were chosen to monitor single turnover of PAI-1 by the enzyme. In this case, 3 μm tPA was reacted with 1 μm E350A/E351A PAI-1, and the reaction products were analyzed as described (20Kvassman J.O. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15491-15502Google Scholar). The limiting rate constant for the formation of the final inhibited complex was determined by fitting the reaction progress curve to a nonlinear function describing a first-order reaction.RESULTSInhibitory Properties of Exosite PAI-1 Variants—To evaluate the effects of site-directed mutations on the ability of PAI-1 to form stable serpin-proteinase complexes, the single (E350A and E351A) and double (E350A/E351A) exosite variants were reacted with a 2-fold molar excess of each proteinase, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Fig. 1 shows that each PAI-1 variant is just as capable as wtPAI-1 in forming SDS-stable complexes with tPA and uPA, as well as β-trypsin (data not shown). In addition, the stoichiometry of inhibition values for tPA, uPA, and β-trypsin were not significantly different from those of control wtPAI-1 reactions (Table I). Although the exosite variants appeared to be functional as proteinase inhibitors, the point mutations reduced the apparent second-order rate constant (kapp) for tPA inhibition (Table I). In comparison with wtPAI-1, the E351A and E350A/E351A variants reduced the kapp by 4- and 5-fold, respectively, but the E350A substitution reduced the kapp by only 2-fold. As indicated in Table I, the exosite substitutions at the P4′ and P5′ residues did not dramatically change the kapp values for the inhibition of uPA and had no effect on the inhibition of β-trypsin. Taken together, the data suggest that the role of the P4′ and P5′ residues in the proteinase inhibition is to increase the specificity for tPA, while having little or no effect on PAI-1 inhibitory activity with uPA and β-trypsin, respectively.Fig. 1Assessment of functional activity of PAI-1 and its exosite variants via SDS-PAGE.

This method has been used in previous studies to determine directly the second-order association rate constant between PAI-1 and various proteinases, such as tPA, uPA, and β-trypsin (21Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the linear dependence of kobs on the effective concentrations of PAI-1 for the three proteinases, and the calculated rate constants are reported in Table II. Among the exosite mutants that were evaluated, E350A/E351A showed a significant (13.4-fold) reduction in ka for tPA compared with wtPAI-1 (Fig. 2A), whereas E350A and E351A showed smaller reductions in ka (3.3- and 5.4-fold, respectively). As observed for the overall proteinase inhibition, the changes in ka values for uPA and β-trypsin were small and indistinguishable, respectively, in comparison with control wtPAI-1 reactions (Fig. 2, B and C).

(2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 800–806). It has also been claimed that extraction of barley etioplasts with 100% acetone containing 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate prevents the conversion of Pchlide b to Pchlide a and leads to the detection of large amounts of Pchlide b in the isolated etioplasts. In this work the extraction protocol of Reinbothe et al. is compared with the more conventional 80% aqueous acetone extraction method. No Pchlide b was detected either in etiolated barley leaves or isolated barley etioplasts irrespective of the extraction protocol. On the other hands, small amounts of Pchlide b were detected in green barley leaves and isolated chloroplasts, extracted either with 80% acetone or 100% acetone containing 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate. It is concluded that the proposed occurrence of a light-harvesting POR-Pchlide-a,b complex in etiolated plant tissues is untenable, and its ensuing consequences and implications, for the greening process, are irrelevant.

The occurrence of monovinyl (MV) 1The abbreviations used are: MVmonovinylDEPdiethyl pyrocarbonatePchlideprotochlorophyllidePORNADPH:Pchlide oxidoreductaseLHPPproposed light harvesting POR-Pchlide complexChlchlorophyll. Pchlide b in green plants was reported in 1991, and its chemical structure was ascertained by 1H NMR and fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy as well as by fluorescence spectroscopy (1.Shedbalkar V.P. Ioannides I.M. Rebeiz C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17151-17157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later on, spectrofluorometric techniques were developed for the quantitative determination of MV-Pchlide b under various growth conditions (2.Ioannides I.M. Shedbalkar V.P. Rebeiz C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Its concentration in green cucumber cotyledons ranged from 400 to 800 pmol/100 mg of tissue protein. It was not detectable in etiolated tissues but was proposed as a logical precursor of chlorophyll b via two distinct biosynthetic routes in greening and green plant tissues (3.Rebeiz C.A.

In 1999, Reinbothe et al. (4.Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. N. & Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) proposed that in barley etioplasts, Pchlide a and Pchlide b formed a supramolecular complex with NADPH and two closely related NADPH:Pchlide oxidoreductases (POR), namely PORA and PORB. The complex was referred to as a light-harvesting POR-Pchlide complex (LHPP). It has also been suggested that LHPP contained five non-photoactive Pchlide b and one photoactive Pchlide a. Reinbothe et al. (4.Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. N. & Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) conjectured that the formation of LHPP is essential for the development of the photosynthetic apparatus and conferred photoprotection upon the greening system. The above claims were rapidly refuted by two separate research groups that could not find any convincing evidence supporting the occurrence of Pchlide b in etiolated barley (5.Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrish M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rudiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 6.Armstrong G.A. Apel K. Rudiger W. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 40-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In response to the aforementioned criticism, Reinbothe et al. (7.Reinbothe S. Pollmann S. Reinbothe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 800-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) recently refined their claims. Although they reasserted their belief in the ubiquitous occurrence of LHPP in etiolated tissues, they proposed that Pchlide b is metabolically unstable, and during conventional pigment extraction in organic solvents, it is rapidly converted to MV-Pchlide a by 7-formyl reductase, an enzyme that has been shown to be active in the conversion of chlorophyll (Chl) b to Chl a (8.Ito H. Ohtsuka T. Ayumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1475-1479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this work we evaluate the assertions of Reinbothe et al. (7.Reinbothe S. Pollmann S. Reinbothe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 800-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and present experimental evidence that rule out (a) the occurrence of Pchlide b in etiolated tissues and (b) its putative conversion to Pchlide a during conventional pigment extraction with 80% acetone. Therefore the proposed occurrence of an LHPP in etiolated plant tissues is untenable, and its ensuing consequences and implications (9.Reinbothe C. Buhr F. Pollman S. Reinbothe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10.Reinbothe C. Lepinat A. Deckers M. Beck E. Reinbothe S. J. Biol.

Plant Material—Barley (Hordeum Vulgare, Hi Barley Brand) seeds were purchased from Illini FS Inc. (Urbana, IL). Germination was carried out in plastic trays containing wet vermiculate either in darkness or in a growth chamber illuminated with 1000-watt metal halide lamps (211 Watt m–2) under a 14-h light/10-h dark photoperiod. At midday, etiolated or green leaves were harvested after 6–7 days of growth at 28 °C. Preparation of Pchlide b Phytyl Ester—Pchlide b phytyl ester was prepared as described elsewhere (1.Shedbalkar V.P. Ioannides I.M. Rebeiz C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17151-17157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pchlide b and its phytyl ester exhibit identical absorbance and fluorescence properties (1.Shedbalkar V.P. Ioannides I.M. Rebeiz C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17151-17157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Etioplasts and Chloroplasts—Etioplasts were prepared from etiolated barley leaves by Percoll density gradient centrifugation as described by Reinbothe et al. (11.Reinbothe S. Krauspe R. Parthier B. Planta. 1990; 181: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12.Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Seidenbecher C. Parthier B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 365-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts were similarly prepared from green barley leaves. Protochlorophyllide Extraction from Etiolated and Green Barley Leaves—All centrifuge tubes used for plastid lysis and pigment extraction were autoclaved. To prevent biochemical artifacts, the upper half of etiolated or green barley leaves (0.3 g) were hand ground in mortar filled with liquid nitrogen. The leaf powder, still covered by liquid nitrogen, was transferred to propylene tubes that were prechilled to –20 °C and containing 30 ml of 100% acetone and 0.1% DEP, as recommended by Reinbothe et al. (7.Reinbothe S. Pollmann S. Reinbothe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 800-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), or containing 6 ml of 80% acetone lacking DEP. According to Reinbothe et al. (7.Reinbothe S. Pollmann S. Reinbothe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 800-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) extraction with 80% acetone leads to the conversion of MV-Pchlide b to MV-Pchlide a. The tissue was further homogenized for 30 s, using a Brinkman homogenizer (Westbury, NY), fitted with a PT 10/35 probe. Pchlide Extraction from Isolated Etioplasts and Chloroplasts—Pigments of either wet etioplast pellets or etioplast suspensions were extracted with a 100-fold excess of 100% acetone containing 0.1% DEP or with 80% acetone lacking DEP. To prevent any enzymatic activity during pigment extraction, etioplast pellets or suspensions were frozen in liquid nitrogen, then 100% acetone containing 0.1% DEP or 80% acetone was added, and the mixture was briefly homogenized. Following centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 12 min at 1 °C, the acetone extract was decanted and stored at –80 °C until use. The 100% acetone extracts (about 30 ml) were concentrated under gas N2 to 5 ml. Some samples were adjusted to 80% acetone with water. Fully esterified tetrapyrroles were extracted from the acetone extracts with hexane as described in (13.Rebeiz C.A. Smith A. Witty M. Heme Chlorophyll and Bilins, Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 111-155Google Scholar). Protochlorophyllides remained in the hexane-extracted acetone fraction as detailed in Ref. 13.Rebeiz C.A. Smith A. Witty M. Heme Chlorophyll and Bilins, Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 111-155Google Scholar. They were transferred to diethyl ether as described in Ref. 13.Rebeiz C.A. Smith A. Witty M. Heme Chlorophyll and Bilins, Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 111-155Google Scholar. Light Treatment—To determine the photoconvertibility of Pchlide a, etiolated barley leaves or isolated etioplasts were subjected to a single 2.5-ms actinic white-light flash that converts Pchlide a to Chlide a (14.Belanger F.C. Rebeiz C.A. Plant Sci. Lett. 1980; 18: 343-350Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Spectrofluorometry—Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a fully corrected photon counting, high resolution SLM spectrofluorometer model 8000 C, interfaced with an IBM model 60 microcomputer. Room temperature determinations were performed in a cylindrical microcell, 3 mm in diameter at emission and excitation bandwidth of 4 nm. 77 K spectra were recorded at emission and excitation bandwidths that varied from 0.5 to 4 nm depending on signal intensity. The photon count was integrated for 0.5 s at each 1-nm increment. Quantitative Pigment Determination—Digital spectral data were automatically converted by the computer into quantitative values via Porphyrin Analytical Tools software. The latter (C. A. Rebeiz and D. G. Saab, copyrighted software) is described on our web site (w3.aces.uiuc. edu/nres/lppbp/Computational Software). Minimum detection levels were about 0.2 pmol/ml of hexane-extracted acetone fraction. Experimental Strategy—To resolve the controversy surrounding the occurrence of MV-Pchlide b in etiolated tissues, a two-pronged experimental approach was adopted. First, Pchlides extraction was carried out as described by Reinbothe et al. (7.Reinbothe S. Pollmann S. Reinbothe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 800-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) either under conditions that prevented the putative conversion of MV-Pchlide b to MV-Pchlide a (i.e. by extraction with 100% acetone containing 0.1% DEP) or under conditions that presumably led to the conversion of MV-Pchlide b to MV-Pchlide a (i.e. by extraction with 80% acetone, lacking DEP). Second, determination of the MV-Pchlide a and b content was achieved unambiguously by use of well established 77 K spectrofluorometric techniques (1.Shedbalkar V.P. Ioannides I.M. Rebeiz C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17151-17157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Ioannides I.M. Shedbalkar V.P. Rebeiz C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 13.Rebeiz C.A. Smith A. Witty M. Heme Chlorophyll and Bilins, Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 111-155Google Scholar,). Indeed, in diethyl ether at 77 K, MV-Pchlide b exhibits well pronounced emission and excitation maxima at 642–643 and 462–463 nm, respectively (1.Shedbalkar V.P. Ioannides I.M. Rebeiz C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17151-17157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand under identical conditions, pentacoordinated MV-Pchlide a exhibits an emission maximum at 625–626 nm and split Soret excitation maxima at 437–438 and 443–445 nm (13.Rebeiz C.A. Smith A. Witty M. Heme Chlorophyll and Bilins, Methods and Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 111-155Google Scholar, 15.Tripathy B.C. Rebeiz C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Pchlide b Does Not Occur in Etiolated Barley—According to Reinbothe et al (7.Reinbothe S. Pollmann S. Reinbothe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 800-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), extraction of etiolated barley tissues or barley etioplasts, with 100% acetone containing 0.1% DEP prevents the conversion of Pchlide b to Pchlide a and results in the detection of substantial amounts of Pchlide b. All attempts to repeat these results with etiolated barley leaves or isolated barley etioplasts failed, irrespective of whether the extraction was performed with 80% acetone (Fig. 1A and B, traces a and b) or 100% acetone containing 0.1% DEP (Fig. 1, A and B, trace c). All emission spectra exhibited pentacoordinated Pchlide a emission maxima in ether at 77 K, at 625–626 nm, and a much lower longer wavelength emission maximum at 642–643 nm that corresponds to the emission maximum of hexacoordinated Pchlide a (Fig. 1A, traces a–c) (16.Belanger F.C. Rebeiz C.A. Spectrochim. Acta. 1984; 40A: 807-827Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The hexacoordinated/pentacoordinated, 642–643/626–627 nm emission ratio of about 0.23, elicited by excitation at 463 nm, corresponds to that of authentic MV-Pchlide a in ether at 77 K. Authentic MV-Pchlide b exhibited an emission maximum at 642–643 nm and a lower and broader, longer wavelength emission maximum at 674–681 nm (1.Shedbalkar V.P. Ioannides I.M. Rebeiz C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17151-17157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A, trace d, and Fig. 2, trace c). Excitation spectra recorded at 643 nm, which corresponds to the mixed emission maximum of Pchlide b + hexacoordinated Pchlide a, exhibited a By (0-0) MV-Pchlide a excitation maximum at 437–438 nm and a Bx (0-0) excitation shoulder at 443–445 nm (Fig. 1B, traces a–c), (15.Tripathy B.C. Rebeiz C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Authentic MV-Pchlide b exhibited a Soret excitation maximum at 462–463 nm (Fig. 1B, trace d), which was missing from the Soret excitation profiles of etiolated barley (Fig. 1B, traces a–c). The use of liquid nitrogen, to stop any enzymatic activity during pigment extraction with cold 100% acetone, had no effect on the extracted Pchlide profile (results not shown). Altogether, these results are in direct contradiction with those reported by Reinbothe et al. (7.Reinbothe S. Pollmann S. Reinbothe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 800-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and confirm our earlier results (2.Ioannides I.M. Shedbalkar V.P. Rebeiz C.A. Anal.

(4.Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. N. & Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), LHPP consists of five PORA-Pchlide b-NADPH ternary complexes and one PORB-Pchlide a-NADPH ternary complex embedded into the lipid bilayers of the prolamellar body of etioplasts. Furthermore, it is stated that in the LHPP complex, only Pchlide a is photoconvertible to Chlide a by light, while Pchlide b is not. As a consequence, if the hypothesis of Reinbothe et al. is correct (4.Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. N. & Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), rapid conversion of the Pchlide pool under non-denaturing conditions should result in about 20% Pchlide photoconversion and the appearance of a Pchlide-Chlide pool that consists of about 80% Pchlide b and 20% Chlide a. Rapid photoreduction of the Pchlide pool of isolated barley etioplasts by a single light flash resulted in the formation of MV-Chlide a, exclusively. No Pchlide b was detected (Table I). Photoconversion rates of Pchlide to Chlide a amounted to 62–72% instead of 20%, irrespective of whether the extraction was performed with 100% acetone containing 0.1% DEP or with 80% acetone (Table I).Table IConversion of the Pchlide pool of isolated barley etioplasts to Chlide a by a single actinic white light flashExp.Light treatmentExtraction methodTetrapyrrolesPchlide bPchlide aChlide aChl aTotal TetsPercent conversionnmol/g proteinADark80% acetoneND1751NDND1751Light80% acetoneND689106043179262BDark100% acetoneND983NDND983Light100% acetoneND2676652996172 Open table in a new tab Small Amounts of Pchlide b along with Larger Amounts of Pchlide a Are Synthesized in Green Barley Leaves—It was reported previously that small amounts of Pchlide b were formed by green plants (1.Shedbalkar V.P. Ioannides I.M. Rebeiz C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17151-17157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Ioannides I.M. Shedbalkar V.P. Rebeiz C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To determine whether the amounts of detectable Pchlide b in green barley were affected by the acetone concentration used in pigment extraction, the Pchlide emission profile of green barley leaves extracted with 80% acetone or 100% acetone containing 0.1% DEP were recorded. As shown in Fig. 2, the ether extract of the carboxylic tetrapyrrole pools of green barley leaves extracted with 80% acetone or with 100% acetone containing 0.1% DEP and excited at 463 nm (the Soret excitation maximum of Pchlide b) exhibited a considerable increase in the Pchlide b + hexacoordinated Pchlide a emission at 642–643 in comparison with the pentacoordinated Pchlide a emission at 626–627 nm. This in turn resulted in an 8.6-fold increase in the 642–643/626–627 nm emission ratio in comparison with authentic Pchlide a, due to the presence of MV-Pchlide b in the green leaf extract. Excitation at 463 nm also elicited emissions at 662 nm and an emission shoulder at 678 nm that correspond to the emission maxima of Chlide b and Chlide a, respectively. The longer wavelength emission of Pchlide b contributes slightly to the emission at 678 nm (Fig. 2, trace c). The amounts of Pchlide a and b accumulation detected in isolated barley chloroplasts suspensions and pellets extracted with 80% acetone or 100% acetone containing 0.1% DEP are reported in Table II. The only observed difference between the two extraction methods was the incomplete pigment extraction achieved with 100% as compared with 80% acetone (Table II).Table IIEffect of solvent used in pigment extraction on the detection of accumulated tetrapyrroles in isolated barley chloroplastsExp.Plant materialExtraction methodTetrapyrrolesPchlide aPchlide bChlide aChlide bChl aChl bnmol/g proteinAChloroplast pellet80% acetone112311388089,25152,259Chloroplast suspension80% acetone1042718294171,66798,148BChloroplast pellet100% acetone19259591107,40159,266Chloroplast suspension100% acetone24146255148,75192,685 Open table in a new tab Small amounts of MV-Pchlide b are readily detectable in green barley leaves and isolated chloroplasts (Fig. 2 and Table II). However, none was detected in etiolated barley leaves and isolated etioplasts irrespective of the extraction procedure (Fig. 1). The only observed difference between extraction with 80% acetone or 100% acetone containing 0.1% DEP was the incomplete pigment extraction achieved with 100% as compared with 80% acetone. The confusion surrounding the occurrence of MV Pchlide b in etiolated tissues may have been caused by the identical fluorescence emission maxima of hexacoordinated MV-Pchlide a and the red emission maximum of MV-Pchlide b at 642–643 nm, in diethyl ether at 77 K (Fig. 1A) (16.Belanger F.C.

However, the hexacoordinated Pchlide a emission maximum at 642–643 nm observed in the Pchlide pools of etiolated barley in diethyl ether at 77 K (Fig. 1A) lacks the Pchlide b signature, i.e. a corresponding Soret excitation maximum at 462–463 nm (Fig. 1B). Finally, although Reinbothe et al. (7.Reinbothe S. Pollmann S. Reinbothe C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 800-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported tabular m/z data for 7-OH-Pchlide a, Pchlide a and Pchlide b, in etiolated barley, the quality of the reported data could not be evaluated in the absence of the authentic mass spectra. Altogether the above results indicate that although small amounts of Pchlide b are detected in chloroplasts isolated from green tissues, none is present in etiolated tissues. It is therefore concluded that Pchlide b plays no role in the greening process of etiolated tissues. On the other hands, we have proposed that in green plants MV Pchlide b contributes to the formation of Chlide b and Chl b, via two distinct routes, namely routes 8 and 11, which are responsible for Chl b formation in green plants (3.Rebeiz C.A.

Every subunit in a tetrameric CNG channel contains a cytoplasmic ligand-binding domain (BD) that includes a β-roll (flanked by short helices) and a single C-terminal helix called the C-helix that was previously found to control efficacy (maximal open probability) and selectivity for cGMP versus cAMP. We constructed a series of chimeric CNG channel subunits, each containing a distinct BD sequence (chosen from among six phylogenetically divergent isoforms) fused to an invariant non-BD sequence. We assayed these “BD substitution” chimeras as homomeric CNG channels in Xenopus oo-cytes to compare their functions and found that the most efficient activation by both cAMP and cGMP derived from the BD of the catfish CNGA4 olfactory modulatory subunit (fCNGA4). We then tested the effects of replacing subregions of the bovine CNGA1 BD with corresponding fCNGA4 sequence and hence identified parts of the fCNGA4 BD producing efficient activation. For instance, replacing either the “hinge” that connects the roll and C-helix subdomains or the BD sequence N-terminal to the hinge greatly enhanced cAMP efficacy. Replacing the “loop-β8” region (the C-terminal end of the β-roll) improved agonist sensitivity for cGMP selectively over cAMP. Our results thus identify multiple BD elements outside the C-helix that control selective ligand interaction and channel gating steps by distinct mechanisms. This suggests that the purine ring of the cyclic nucleotide may interact with both the β-roll and the C-helix at different points in the mechanism.

These channels are widespread in the nervous system and in a variety of other tissues, and most notably they are essential signaling components in visual and olfactory transduction, where their activation leads both to changes in membrane potential and to the influx of calcium into the cytoplasm (reviewed in Refs. 1Burns M.E. Baylor D.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 779-805Google Scholar and 2Zufall F. Firestein S. Shepherd G.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 577-607Google Scholar). Functional CNG channels are tetramers (homomeric or heteromeric) of homologous subunits; vertebrates contain a family of six paralogous CNG channel subunit genes in two phylogenetic subfamilies (3Bradley J. Frings S. Yau K.W. Reed R. Science. 2001; 294: 2095-2096Google Scholar), CNGA and CNGB. Distinct combinations of these paralogues are expressed in each tissue type to produce CNG channels whose response parameters are presumably adapted to the physiological requirements of the tissue; these parameters include sensitivity and efficacy (maximal ligandgated open probability) for cAMP and cGMP and selectivity for one agonist over the other. Thus, CNG channels hold promise as targets for tissue-specific pharmacological regulation of signaling through cyclic nucleotide-dependent, electrical, and calcium-dependent pathways. It is therefore important to understand how CNG channel function is determined by the sequences of individual subunits and more generally how structural elements in the channel work together to control the quantitative properties of the ligand gating mechanism.All CNG channel subunits have a common modular architecture (reviewed in Refs. 4Zagotta W.N. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 235-263Google Scholar and 5Biel M. Zong X. Ludwig A. Sautter A. Hofmann F. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 151-171Google Scholar) incorporating recognized structural motifs, namely a 6TM domain joined at its cytoplasmic C-terminal end to a conserved “C-linker” region of ∼80 residues, followed by a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (BD). The 6TM domain is homologous to that of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, with six membrane-spanning segments (S1-S6) and a re-entrant “P-loop” between S5 and S6 that lines the aqueous pore. The BD is homologous to those of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases, cAMP-dependent G-protein exchange factors, and the bacterial catabolite activator protein. BD sequences are also found (associated with the 6TM domain and C-linker regions) in several ion channel families with homology to CNG channels, such as the HCN “pacemaker” and the EAG channels. Useful models for the CNG channel BD are based on known three-dimensional structures of homologous BDs (6Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Google Scholar, 7Su Y. Dostmann W.R.

The roll subdomain consists of an eight-stranded β-roll flanked by two short helices, called the “A-helix” and the “B-helix.” The β-roll itself contains (between its sixth and seventh β-strands) a short “P-helix” and “PB-loop” that constitute a conserved phosphate-binding cassette (10Diller T.C. Xuong Madhusudan, N.H. Taylor S.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 73-82Google Scholar). The C-helix subdomain consists of a single long helix; one particular C-helix residue has been shown to control agonist selectivity in bovine CNGA1, presumably by forming a specific contact with the purine ring of the ligand (11Varnum M.D. Black K.D. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 619-625Google Scholar).We reasoned that phylogenetically divergent CNG channel subunit isoforms should have accumulated mutations in many functionally important parts of the BD in the course of adaptation to different physiological settings, and analysis of these mutations could be useful in investigating the structural determinants of channel activation. We previously assessed the importance of sequence polymorphism in the BD by constructing a series of chimeric CNG channel subunits in which each chimera contained a distinct BD sequence, but all chimeras shared identical sequence outside the BD (12Young E.C. Sciubba D.M. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 523-546Google Scholar). These “BD substitution” chimeras enabled direct functional comparisons between BD sequences. We have now expanded the previous set of three BD substitution chimeras to test BDs from a phylogenetically diverse range of CNG channel isoforms. This revealed a broad spectrum of response properties deriving from BD sequence polymorphism and led to the identification of one particular sequence (from catfish CNGA4) that produced extremely efficient activation properties. This BD sequence was then dissected to identify specific subsequences in which polymorphism strongly influences efficacy or sensitivity. Our analysis shows that multiple BD regions (outside the previously studied C-helix ligand contact) contribute to highly efficient ligand gating; these regions moreover control distinct sets of molecular interactions during the activation process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Subcloning—Subcloning in the oocyte expression vector pGEM-HE and chimera construction and mutagenesis by PCR were done as described (12Young E.C.

The C-terminal regions of these genes were aligned using Clustal W (see Fig. 1C) to define homologous positions; then the BD sequence was defined as bCNGA1 Leu485-Ala614 and homologous sequences in the other subunits. Similarly, the putative ligand contact position is defined as bCNGA1 Asp604 and homologous positions in other BDs. New X chimeras were constructed by substitution of the BD in the chimera ROON-S2 previously studied (21Tibbs G.R. Goulding E.H. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 612-615Google Scholar, 22Tibbs G.R.

All sequences subjected to PCR were dideoxy-sequenced.Patch Clamp Recording of Channel Currents and Data Analysis— The procedures were essentially performed as described (12Young E.C. Sciubba D.M. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 523-546Google Scholar). In brief, Xenopus oocytes were injected with 0.25-25 ng of RNA; 1-5 days later, inside-out patches were obtained with electrodes of resistance 1-5 MΩ (coated with Sylgard for single-channel recording). The pipette and bath solutions both contained 67 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2 with KOH. Na-cAMP or Na-cGMP were included in the bath solution by iso-osmolar replacement of NaCl and applied by gravity perfusion. Patch clamp equipment, software, and data acquisition and analysis were as described (12Young E.C. Sciubba D.M. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 523-546Google Scholar).Macroscopic currents elicited by cyclic nucleotide were recorded at -100 mV (filtered at 4 kHz, digitized at 1 kHz) after the steady-state current level was reached and were corrected by subtraction of leak currents recorded without agonist. Time stationarity of dose-response curves (i.e. completion of spontaneous run-up or run-down (26Molokanova E. Maddox F. Luetje C.W. Kramer R.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4786-4795Google Scholar)) was verified as described (12Young E.C. Sciubba D.M. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 523-546Google Scholar). For each curve, response current I at agonist concentration [A] was fitted (with weighting by 1/S.D.) with the Hill equation, I = Imax/(1 + (K1/2/[A])h), where K1/2 is the concentration of A eliciting half-maximal activation, h is the Hill coefficient, and Imax is the maximal current amplitude. Dose responses collected for cAMP and cGMP in the same patch were used to evaluate selectivity ratios (K1/2,cGMP/K1/2,cAMP and Imax,cAMP/Imax,cGMP). Ratios significantly less than or greater than unity indicate selectivity for cGMP or cAMP, respectively.Single-channel currents in steady-state agonist concentrations were recorded at -80 mV (filtered at 4 kHz, digitized at 20 kHz), and open probability (Popen) was evaluated from all points current amplitude histograms as described (12Young E.C. Sciubba D.M. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 523-546Google Scholar). Maximal conductance and two prominent subconductances from proton block were characteristic of previously studied X chimeras (12Young E.C. Sciubba D.M. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen.

Pmax was determined as Popen from continuous stretches of data (>30 s) in 10 μm cAMP for X-fA4, 3 mm cAMP or cGMP for RO-fA4, 30 mm cAMP for RO-rA4, 3 mm cGMP, or 30 mm cAMP for RO-fA4 Asp. To normalize dose responses in terms of Popen for Figs. 3, 4, and 6, data and Hill fits for both agonists were multiplied by Pmax/Imax of the agonist giving higher Imax.Fig. 3Chimeras with disfavored opening reveal efficacy differences.A, design and single-channel recordings of RO chimera homomers containing fCNGA4 or rCNGA4 BDs.

This assumes that open channel conductance is the same in saturating cAMP and cGMP and that Pmax,cGMP is near unity. If the latter assumption is omitted, Imax,cAMP/Imax,cGMP is an upper limit on Pmax,cAMP. However, both assumptions were validated for RO-bA1 previously (13Paoletti P. Young E.C. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 17-34Google Scholar, 21Tibbs G.R. Goulding E.H. Siegelbaum S.A.

In addition, Pmax,cGMP > 0.95 was verified directly in single-channel recordings for at least two patches each (>3 mm cGMP) of RO-bA1{4}, RO-bA1{4.1}, RO-bA1{4.2}, and RO-bA1{1-3}. We assumed that a fully liganded channel has a single closed and a single open state, so the free energy of opening in saturating cAMP is ΔGsat,cAMP = -RT ln [Pmax,cAMP/(1 - Pmax,cAMP)]. The change in ΔGsat,cAMP associated with converting RO-bA1 to a subregion chimera was calculated by subtracting the mean ΔGsat,cAMP for RO-bA1 from the mean ΔGsat,cAMP for the new chimera, that is, ΔΔGsat = ΔGsat,cAMP[new] - ΔGsat,cAMP[RO-bA1]. Unless otherwise noted, the means are reported ± S.D. with the sample size (n), and unpaired t test was used to assess the significance in population differences.Table IIIActivation properties of subregion replacement RO chimeras The values are the means ± S.D. of measurements from individual patches (numbers of patches in parentheses).

Sciubba D.M. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 523-546Google Scholar) all share identical sequence outside the BD region; differences between X chimeras can thus be attributed to BD sequence differences. The invariant non-BD sequence (X) consists of the bovine CNGA1 (bCNGA1) sequence with two sequence regions replaced by corresponding residues from catfish CNGA2 (fCNGA2) for technical advantages (Fig. 1A). Replacement of the P-loop increases ion conductance through the open channel (23Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Liu D. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1993; 364: 61-64Google Scholar), facilitating current detection in both macroscopic current and single-channel recordings. Replacement of the “N-S2” region favors the intrinsic opening transition, enhancing the response to any agonist (21Tibbs G.R. Goulding E.H. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 612-615Google Scholar, 27Goulding E.H. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 369-374Google Scholar). These two replacements increase the chances of observing cyclic nucleotide-activated currents from X chimeras containing BDs of unknown functionality that might work poorly in activation.The previous study tested BDs from bCNGA1, fCNGA2, and rat CNGA4 (rCNGA4); this study included BDs from more phylogenetically diverse isoforms, namely CNGA4 recently cloned from catfish olfactory epithelium (fCNGA4) and TAX-4 and TAX-2 from the nematode C. elegans (Fig. 1, B and C). Whereas bCNGA1, fCNGA2, and TAX-4 are classed as “conventional” type because they can form functional homomeric CNG channels, rCNGA4, fCNGA4, and TAX-2 are classed as “modulatory” type because they cannot form functional homomeric CNG channels but do coassemble with conventional subunits in heteromers. Nonetheless, X chimeras derived from BDs of either conventional or modulatory subunits were equally capable of expression alone in Xenopus oocytes, forming channels that responded to cyclic nucleotide when assayed in excised inside-out membrane patches using voltage-clamp recording. Thus, like the previously studied rCNGA4 BD, the BDs of the modulatory subunits fCNGA4 and TAX-2 can support channel activation in a homomeric channel without relying on any residues of a conventional subunit BD.Sensitivity of the X chimeras to low agonist concentrations was quantified by K1/2, the concentration eliciting half-maximal activation (Table I). The chimera X-fA4, containing the fCNGA4 BD, stands out because of its extreme sensitivity to cAMP. Single-channel records (Fig. 2A) show that 10 μm cAMP is sufficient to increase the open probability (Popen) of X-fA4 to >0.99 (only rare brief channel closures were detected). X-fA4 is also sensitive to micromolar cGMP, but this property is not unique, appearing also in X-bA1, X-TAX4, and X-TAX2. However, these latter chimeras have K1/2,cAMP more than an order of magnitude higher than K1/2,cGMP. Thus, the fCNGA4 BD in X-fA4 is unique in that its high sensitivity applies similarly to both agonists.Table IActivation properties of BD substitution CNG channel chimeras (“X-chimera” series) The numbers of patches are given in parentheses for the means ± S.D. of values from individual patches; the values without number of patches are ratios of means.ChimeraBD sourceK1/2Selectivity ratiosSynonym and reference for previous datacAMPcGMPSensitivity (K1/2,cGMP/K1/2,cAMP)Efficacy (Imax,cAMP/Imax,cGMP)μmX-fA4catfish CNGA41.01 ± 0.17 (11)0.73 ± 0.10 (11)0.721 ± 0.034 (11)0.991 ± 0.020 (11)X-rA4rat CNGA481 ± 85 (9)120 ± 140 (9)1.45 ± 0.14 (9)1.024 ± 0.019 (9)X-β (12)X-fA2catfish CNGA2643 ± 29 (6)261 ± 12 (6)0.407 ± 0.0261.38 ± 0.11 (5)X-α (12)X-bA1bovine CNGA1432 ± 99 (4)1.8 ± 1.0 (10)0.0042 ± 0.00250.98ROON-S2 (21,22)X-TAX4C. elegans TAX-4680 ± 37 (2)3.70 ± 0.59 (2)0.00546 ± 0.00057 (2)0.743 ± 0.039 (2)X-TAX2C. elegans TAX-274 ± 33 (6)2.0 ± 1.3 (6)0.0286 ± 0.0049 (6)0.926 ± 0.044 (6) Open table in a new tab Fig. 2The fCNGA4 BD mediates efficient activation with cGMP selectivity.A, excerpted recordings of a single homomeric X-fA4 channel in an inside-out patch held at -80 mV, with steady-state cAMP concentrations indicated.

Physiol. 2001; 118: 523-546Google Scholar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A given subsaturating concentration of cGMP reliably elicited larger X-fA4 currents than did the same concentration of cAMP (Fig. 2B, upper traces). This cGMP selectivity was unexpected because the fCNGA4 BD has a methionine residue in its putative C-helix ligand contact position (11Varnum M.D. Black K.D. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 619-625Google Scholar), where other cGMP-selective X chimeras (X-bA1, X-TAX4, and X-TAX-2) have aspartate. In fact, in the rCNGA4 BD, a methionine ligand contact imparts cAMP selectivity (28Pagès F. Ildefonse M. Ragno M. Crouzy S. Bennett N. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1227-1239Google Scholar, 29Shapiro M.S. Zagotta W.N. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2307-2320Google Scholar), as confirmed in X-rA4 (12Young E.C. Sciubba D.M. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 523-546Google Scholar). The cGMP selectivity of X-fA4 might thus suggest that the methionine in the fCNGA4 C-helix cannot form the ligand interaction required for cAMP selectivity, perhaps because of a different structure in this region. We disproved this possibility by constructing a new X chimera, named X-rA4R/fA4C, which contains the roll subdomain of rCNGA4 (indicated by subscript R) and the C-helix of fCNGA4 (indicated by subscript C); this chimera shows cAMP selectivity at low agonist concentrations (Fig. 2, B and C). Fig. 2D summarizes K1/2 measurements for cAMP and cGMP in individual patches of X-fA4, X-rA4, and X-rA4R/fA4C, which all have the methionine ligand contact. Even though the absolute K1/2 values observed for a chimera varied from patch to patch, the K1/2 selectivity of X-fA4 was always in favor of cGMP, whereas both X-rA4 and X-rA4R/fA4C always favored cAMP. This shows that the fCNGA4 C-helix has cAMP-selective determinants (presumably including the ligand contact methionine) similar to those of the rCNGA4 C-helix. We propose that the intact fCNGA4 BD exhibits cGMP selectivity because the fCNGA4 roll subdomain contains some cGMP-selective elements, whose energetic contributions to gating properties outweigh those of the cAMP-selective C-helix.Efficacies Compared Using a New Series of BD Substitution Chimeras—Comparisons of X chimeras clearly show differences in BD sensitivity, but the K1/2 parameter in isolation is poorly informative of microscopic physical processes such as ligand binding or channel opening (30Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Google Scholar). It is more valuable to compare the efficacy (maximal open probability, Pmax) in saturating agonist concentrations where every channel should have uniform (i.e. maximal) BD occupancy. Unfortunately, several X chimeras have extremely high efficacy (e.g. X-fA4 in Fig. 2A), and differences in their respective equilibrium constants for channel opening at saturating agonist concentration would not be easily detectable, because the numerical difference in their Pmax values would be too small. We predicted that BD substitution chimeras using a design similar to the X chimeras but containing a different N-S2 sequence that disfavored intrinsic channel opening might exhibit efficacies that were significantly less than unity; efficacy differences between chimeras would then be more readily apparent. We therefore incorporated the BDs from modulatory subunits (rCNGA4, fCNGA4, and TAX-2) into a new series of chimeras, called “RO chimeras,” in which the N-S2 sequence was that of intact bCNGA1 (Fig. 3A). The RO chimeras still contain the P-loop of fCNGA2 to facilitate single-channel recording, but all of the sequence N-terminal to the P-loop matches exactly that of bCNGA1. All of the RO chimeras were found to be capable of forming functional homomeric CNG channels, repeating our success with the X chimeras. Table II summarizes the properties of the new RO chimeras and includes also RO-bA1 containing the bCNGA1 BD, which was called RO133 in previous studies (13Paoletti P. Young E.C. Siegelbaum S.A. J.

https://openalex.org/W2000147308,"We have investigated the prefibrillar state of salmon (s) and human (h) calcitonin (CT). Size exclusion chromatography at pH 3.3 and 7.4 indicates that sCT is present in solution as a dimer, whereas hCT elutes as a monomer at pH 3.3 and as monomer-dimer at pH 7.4. Guanidine hydrochloride unfolding experiments show that dimerization is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. We investigated the dimeric structure by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and calculations by using an sCT mutant (LAsCT) in which Pro23 and Arg24 were substituted for Leu23 and Ala24. As indicated by the Leu9–Tyr27 and Leu12–Leu19 contacts, the mutated hormone forms a head-to-tail dimer whose basic unit is an α-helix in the region Leu12–Tyr22. The solution behavior of LAsCT is identical to that of sCT, so the dimeric structure can safely be extended to sCT: we believe that such a structure inhibits fibril maturation in sCT. No stable dimer was observed for hCT, which we attributed to the absence of a defined helical structure. However, we suggest that intermolecular collisions of short ordered regions (for example, a sequence of turns) in hCT favors intermolecular contacts, and specific orientation can be obtained through hydrogen bond formation involving Tyr12, Phe16, and Phe19, with the aromatic ring acting as an acceptor. Taken together, our results indicate that hCT fibrillation can be reduced by favoring a helical dimer, obtainable by replacing the three aromatic amino acids with leucines.

Protein amyloid fibrils are found in about 20 diseases of unrelated origin, including Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus (type II diabetes), familial amyloidosis, light chain amyloidosis, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and Parkinson's disease (1Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). It is not known which structural features cause specific proteins to form amyloid fibrils in vivo; however, evidence is accumulating that aggregation is initiated from specific regions within a polypeptide chain (2Taddei N.

Human calcitonin (hCT), 1The abbreviations used are: CT, calcitonin; hCT, human CT; sCT, salmon CT; LAsCT, sCT with Pro23–Arg24 substituted by Leu-Ala; BPTI, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor; MD, molecular dynamics; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy; r.m.s., root mean square; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy. a 32-amino-acid polypeptide hormone of ∼3.4 kDa (Scheme 1) produced by thyroidal C-cells, forms amyloid fibrils associated with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (7Benvegna S. Trimarchi F. Facchiano A. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1994; 17: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Synthetic hCT also forms amyloid fibrils in vitro, with a morphology similar to the thyroid deposits (8Arvinte T. Cudd A. Drake A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6415-6422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcitonin (CT) can be used to treat various diseases including Paget's disease and osteoporosis (9Zaidi M. Inzerillo A.M. Moonga B.S. Bevis P.J. Huang C.L. Bone (NY). 2002; 30: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but the tendency of hCT to associate into amyloid fibrils at physiological pH limits its efficacy as a drug. Salmon CT (sCT) (Scheme 1), the clinically used alternative to hCT, causes immunogenic reactions (10Levy F. Muff R. Dotti-Sigrist S. Dambacher M.A. Fisher J.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the mechanism of amyloid formation by hCT and controlling this process are important not only in the context of amyloid formation but also as a step toward improved therapeutic use of CT. The detailed molecular mechanism of CT fibril formation is not yet well understood. It has been proposed that the first step is a homogeneous association of α-helices to form the nucleus of a fibril followed by an autocatalytic heterogeneous fibrillation of β-sheets to form a mature fibril (11Kamihira M. Naito A. Tuzi S. Nosaka Y.A. Saitô H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that hydrophobic interactions favor the formation of α-helical bundles, whereas charged amino acids regulate the β-sheet association (12Kanaori K. Nosaka A.Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12138-12143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fibrillation of sCT is much slower than hCT, requiring more than 8 months as compared with 21 min for hCT at 1 mg/ml and pH 7.4 (8Arvinte T. Cudd A. Drake A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6415-6422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); furthermore, the fibrillation of hCT at low pH is slower than that at physiological pH (8Arvinte T. Cudd A. Drake A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6415-6422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that the proposed fibrillation mechanism involves a homogeneous aggregation of α-helices, it is surprising that sCT does not fibrillate, despite having a helical propensity higher than hCT (13Siligardi G. Samorì B. Melandri S. Visconti M. Drake A.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1117-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Amodeo P. Motta A. Strazzullo G. Castiglione Morelli M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To understand the structural determinants that cause the differing fibrillation mechanism of hCT and sCT, we investigated the prefibrillar state of both hormones. Size exclusion chromatography at pH 3.3 and 7.4 indicate that sCT is present in solution as a dimer. hCT is eluted as a monomer at pH 3.3 but is in equilibrium between dimer and monomer at pH 7.4. The structure of dimeric sCT was investigated by NMR spectroscopy and calculations by resorting to an sCT mutant (referred to as LAsCT) in which Pro23 and Arg24 were substituted for Leu23 and Ala24 (Scheme 1). LAsCT showed properties identical to those of sCT, the only difference being the stability and the length of the amphipathic α-helix in membrane-like environment. 2G. Andreotti, B. López Méndez, P. Amodeo, M. A. Castiglione Morelli, H. Nakamuta, and A. Motta, submitted. We report here that, in water, LAsCT forms an α-helical head-to-tail dimer in the region Leu12–Tyr22. Guanidine HCl unfolding experiments at physiological pH indicate that hydrophobic interactions are responsible for the association of all three calcitonins. The striking similarity between LAsCT and sCT strongly suggests that sCT dimerizes via the hydrophobic face of the helix using the leucines at sites 12, 16, and 19. On the contrary, hCT, in which the key leucines are substituted by aromatic residues (Scheme 1), takes up a sequence of turns in the central region. An important issue is whether aromatic amino acids in hCT have a driving role in fibril formation (5Reches M. Porat Y. Gazit E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35475-35480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Our results support this idea. The absence of a defined helix in the central region of hCT corroborates the requirement for fibrillation of specific chemical properties in a definite region of the hormone (5Reches M. Porat Y. Gazit E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35475-35480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Intermolecular collision of short ordered regions is a possible mechanism to bring together two molecules to allow chemical interaction. In particular, the presence of aromatic residues at sites 12, 16, and 19 in hCT would drive a specific orientation through hydrogen bond formation, the benzene ring acting as hydrogen bond acceptor. Such a mechanism could well explain fibril formation by short hCT-based peptides. Furthermore, leucines (but not aromatic residues) in the central region of sCT and LAsCT favor a stable prefibrillar helical dimer that prevents amyloid formation. We therefore propose that hCT fibrillation can be prevented by stabilizing a leucine-based helical dimer, which can be achieved by substituting aromatic amino acids for leucine residues at sites 12, 16, and 19. Biological support for our conclusion is given by a report showing a 20-fold increase of hCT hypocalcaemic potency, obtained by replacing aromatic amino acids by Leu residues (15Maier R. Kamber B. Riniker B. Rittel W. Clin. Endocrinol. 1976; 5 (suppl.): 327S-332SCrossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, our finding strongly supports the hypothesis (16Kallberg Y. Gustafsson M. Persson B. Thyberg J. Johansson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12945-12950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) that stabilization of an α-helix/β-strand-discordant stretch (i.e. an α-helix in a polypeptide segment that should form a β-strand according to secondary structure predictions) into α-helix avoids amyloid fibril formation. Peptide Synthesis—sCT, LAsCT, and hCT (a gift from Dr. Nagana A. Goud, Bachem, Torrance, CA) were prepared by standard methods. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was carried out at room temperature, using a 1.5 × 50-cm Sephadex G-50 Fine column at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Chromatography was performed at pH 7.4, using 20 mm phosphate containing 100 mm NaCl, and at pH 3.3, using 20 mm acetate containing 100 mm NaCl. The concentrations used for hCT were as follows: 0.15, 0.36, and 1.33 mm at pH 3.3 and 0.081 and 0.31 mm at pH 7.4. The concentrations used for sCT and LAsCT were as follows: 0.40 and 0.45 mm at pH 3.3, and 0.58 mm at pH 7.4. Insulin B-chain (3.5 kDa) and bovine pancreatic tripsin inhibitor (BPTI, 6.6 kDa), both purchased from Sigma, were used as molecular weight standards. Peptide concentrations were determined by ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy using coefficients at 275 nm of 1531 and 1515 cm-1m-1 for hCT, sCT, and LAsCT, respectively (17Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Orlowski R.C. Schleuter R.J. Boni L.T. Hui S.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5074-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Measurements were performed on a Jasco-J710 spectropolarimeter connected to a water bath used to control the temperature of the cell. LAsCT CD spectra were recorded in the far UV region (200–240 nm) at 295 K and pH 3.3 (20 mm acetate, 100 mm NaCl) and 7.4 (20 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl) with a peptide concentration of 0.072 mm in a 1.0-cm path length cell. Spectra in the presence of 0.4 m SDS, at both pHs, were acquired with a peptide concentration of 0.41 mm in a 0.1-cm path length cell. A spectral bandwidth of 2.0 nm and a scan speed of 10 nm/min were used. The precision of the data was improved by averaging five scans, and the results are reported as mean residue ellipticity (θ). Prediction of percentages of secondary structure from CD spectra was obtained using the k2d software, a Kohonen neural network with a two-dimensional output layer (18Andrade M.A. Chacón P. Morán F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 19Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Morán F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 443-454Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (www.embl-heidelberg.de/∼andrade/k2d). Possible fibril formation of each peptide was monitored at 293 K with time course experiments for 24 h by following the ellipticity at 205 nm. Freshly dissolved peptide was used at different concentrations (0.030, 0.060, and 0.18 mm at pH 3.3 and 7.4, in 20 mm acetate and phosphate buffers, respectively, both containing 100 mm NaCl). CD spectra of LAsCT and sCT samples corresponding to the above concentrations, as obtained from a sample of 0.59 mm kept at room temperature, were examined after 8 months. Guanidine Denaturation—The guanidine hydrochloride denaturation studies of hCT, sCT, and LAsCT were carried out at 295 K in 100 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. Mixtures of freshly prepared stock solutions of peptide, phosphate buffer, and guanidine hydrochloride were made to obtain denaturant concentration ranging from 0 to 4 m. The final peptide concentration was 0.1 mg/ml. Preliminary experiments showed that incubation of 30 min was sufficient to reach the equilibrium. Guanidine-induced unfolding was monitored by measuring ellipticity at 220 nm as a function of denaturant concentration. The CD spectrum of each sample was recorded between 210 and 230 nm in a 0.1-cm path length cell. A spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm and a scan speed of 50 nm/min were used, and each spectrum was accumulated five times. All the spectra were corrected for the contribution of the buffer. The results are reported as mean residue ellipticity. NMR Data Collection—All CT samples were prepared by dissolving the appropriate amounts of the peptide in 0.5 ml of 1H2O, 2H2O (90/10 v/v) to yield concentrations of 0.59 mm. Deuterated water was obtained from CortecNet (Paris, France). 1H NMR spectra, recorded at 293 K and pH 3.3 and 7.4, were acquired on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz using an inverse multinuclear probehead fitted with gradients along the x, y, and z axes. Spectra were referenced to sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-(2,2,3,3-2H4)propionate. Homonuclear two-dimensional clean TOCSY (20Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) and NOESY (21Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4857) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded by incorporating the excitation sculpting sequence (22Hwang T.-L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1590) Google Scholar) for water suppression. We used a pulsed-field gradient double echo with a soft square pulse of 4 ms at the water resonance frequency, with the gradient pulses of 1 ms each in duration. 512 equally spaced evolution time period t1 values were acquired, averaging 16 transients of 2048 points, with 6024 Hz of spectral width. Time domain data matrices were all zero-filled to 4096 in both dimensions, yielding a digital resolution of 2.94 Hz/point. Prior to Fourier transformation, resolution enhancement was applied with a Lorentz-Gauss window to both t1 and t2 dimensions for all the experiments. NOESY spectra were obtained with different mixing times (100, 200, 300, and 400 ms), TOCSY experiments were recorded with a spin-lock period of 64 and 96 ms, achieved with the MLEV-17 pulse sequence Structure Calculations—Distance restraints for structure calculations were obtained by integrating the volumes of NOE peaks at different mixing times and representing the buildup of the NOEs by a second-order polynomial. The corresponding interproton distances were calculated using an r-6 dependence of the initial slope. An upper bound was set for all distance restraints to 10% above the calculated distance, whereas the lower bound was set conservatively to 0.25 nm, representing a value close to van der Waals contact. For the methyl protons, a correction of 0.03 nm was made (23Koning T.M.G. Boelens R. Kaptein R. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 111-123Google Scholar). ϕ and Ψ dihedral angle restraints were derived from 3JNHα coupling constants. The structure of the monomer was calculated with 230 NOEs (109 intraresidue, 85 sequential (αCHi–NHi+1, βCHi–NHi+1, and NHi–NHi+1), and 36 medium range (αCHi–NHi+n, n ≥ 2, and αCHi–βCHi+3)). For the dimer, we used a total of 464 NOEs, which include four intermolecular NOEs defining the mutual orientation of single chains. Model building and preliminary calculations were performed with the united atom model (24Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4904) Google Scholar) with the SYBYL 6.2 package (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). The solvation effects were approximated by using a distance-dependent dielectric constant ϵ = r. A cutoff radius of 0.8 nm for non-bonded interactions, with a residue-based pair list generation routine, was used for all calculations. In the united atom model, distance restraints were included as C–C or C–N distance, increasing the upper limits calculated for interproton distances by 0.1 nm. Semiparabolic penalty functions were used with force constants in energy minimization and room temperature molecular dynamics (MD) of 83.33 kJ mol-1 radians-2 for dihedral restraints and 8.33 kJ mol-1 nm-2 for distance restraints. In simulated annealing and preliminary MD simulations, a time step of 1 fs was used, with no restraints on bond length. Simulated annealing runs were performed with different lengths (from 10 to 250 ps), temperatures (maximum values from 500 to 800 K, applied for 25–75% of the total time, cooling rates from 1 to 5 K ps-1), and restraint force constant time profiles. Energy minimization and MD simulations with solvent were performed with the SANDER module of the AMBER 4.1 package. A time step of 2 fs, with rigid restraint of all bond lengths (SHAKE algorithm) (25Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comp. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (17344) Google Scholar, 26van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J.C. Mol. Physiol. 1977; 34: 1311-1327Crossref Scopus (1595) Google Scholar), and periodic boundary conditions were applied. All MD simulations were performed in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble (300 K, 1 atm), with a solvent box that initially extended 0.8 nm from the most external solute atom on each side of the box. Molecular structures were drawn and analyzed with the graphics program MOLMOL (27Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6503) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—The apparent molecular weights of hCT and sCT at non-fibrillating concentration were measured by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column using as eluents 20 mm phosphate containing 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) and 20 mm acetate containing 100 mm NaCl (pH 3.3). sCT (Fig. 1A, open circles) eluted at pH 3.3 with an apparent molecular mass of 6.6 kDa (compare with BPTI, 6.6 kDa, stars) instead of 3.4 kDa as indicated by its amino acid composition. On the contrary, hCT (open squares) eluted with an apparent molecular mass corresponding to that of the insulin B-chain (3.5 kDa, crosses). Therefore, whereas sCT elutes as a dimer, hCT appears as a monomer. Both elution patterns are symmetric, as are those of the two standards, and this implies the presence of a single species in solution. At pH 7.4 (Fig. 1B), sCT shows an elution profile (filled circles) with a predominant component corresponding to the molecular weight of a dimer, with a slight tail due to the presence of a second minor component corresponding to sCT monomer. Such an asymmetry of the eluted peak is characteristic of a dissociating system (28Cunningham B.C. Mulkerrin M.G. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 253: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), suggesting an equilibrium between the two forms strongly favoring the dimer. The elution pattern of hCT (Fig. 1B, filled squares) is asymmetric with a sharper front edge between monomer and dimer and a tail region showing a distinct second component corresponding to hCT monomer, suggestive of a slow equilibrium between the two forms. Denaturation with Guanidine Hydrochloride—Fig. 2 depicts the denaturation curves at pH 7.4 and 295 K, obtained by monitoring the hCT (filled squares) and sCT (filled circles) ellipticities at 220 nm as a function of guanidine HCl concentration. Upon addition of guanidine, we observed a reduction of ellipticity for both hormones. This is consistent with the presence of hydrophobicity-induced association for both hCT and sCT. Identical behavior was observed for sCT at pH 3.3 (not shown), supporting the relevance of hydrophobic association in the formation of the dimer at both acidic and physiological pH. LAsCT, an sCT Mutant Used to Characterize the Dimer—The possibility of characterizing the sCT dimer relies on its stability in solution. In water, at physiological conditions, CD spectra indicate that neither hCT nor sCT have significant ordered structure (29Arvinte T. Drake A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6408-6414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reported α-helix percentages are ∼8% for hCT and ∼14% for sCT, with ∼18% of turns. NMR NOESY experiments of hCT and sCT in water at pH 7.4 (not shown) indicated the presence of strong αCHi–NHi+1 connectivities along the whole chain of hCT and sCT, and weak NHi–NHi+1 connectivities concentrated in the 12–20 region and in the Cys1–Cys7 loop. Furthermore, we noticed the presence of scattered αCHi–NHi+2 and βCHi–NHi+1 connectivities. This finding argues for the presence of a structure fluctuating between an extended chain and a sequence of turns located in the central region of CT (30Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 162-170Google Scholar). We synthesized the LAsCT mutant to lengthen and stabilize the helix. A detailed structural study by NMR spectroscopy and calculations of LAsCT in the presence of SDS2 indicated that LAsCT does have a longer (Leu4–Gly28) and more stable helix than does sCT (Thr6–Tyr22). What structure does it assume in water? Fig. 3 shows the CD spectra of LAsCT at pH 7.4 and 295 K in water (broken line) and in SDS (continuous line). Estimation of the secondary structure by the k2d neural network algorithm (18Andrade M.A. Chacón P. Morán F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 19Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Morán F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 443-454Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) suggests the presence of ∼20% α-helix in water. In SDS, a dominant α-helix is clearly discernable, as two minima with high ellipticity values are observed at 220 and 208 nm. We estimated the presence of 56% α-helix, significantly lower than the 75% obtained by NMR studies. Therefore, although secondary structure estimation from CD spectra is less reliable than from NMR, we think that the detected helical percentage (∼20%) indicates a sufficient stability to promote the dimer. Possible fibril formation by LAsCT was examined (with time course) at pH 3.3 and 7.4 for freshly dissolved peptide at different concentrations (0.031, 0.060, and 0.18 mm). The ellipticity at 205 nm was monitored for 24 h without any appreciable variation of the signal. We also compared the CD spectra of the samples above with corresponding concentrations derived from a sample of 0.59 mm kept at room temperature for 8 months without showing macroscopic evidence of aggregation. The spectra from the two sets are identical, so we concluded that the fibrillation time for LAsCT is a slow process, similar to that reported for sCT (8Arvinte T. Cudd A. Drake A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6415-6422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel filtration experiments indicated that at pH 3.3 and 7.4, the elution patterns of LAsCT are symmetric and correspond to an apparent dimeric molecular weight. Finally, the denaturation curve at pH 7.4 is very similar to that observed for sCT, confirming the hydrophobic nature of the interactions stabilizing the dimer. Therefore, we conclude that, except for the longer helical segment, the solution behavior of LAsCT is identical to that of sCT. LAsCT Forms an Antiparallel α-Helix Dimer in Water—The NMR spectral assignment of LAsCT was carried out at pH 3.3 and pH 7.4 by the homonuclear 1H NMR approach (30Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 162-170Google Scholar). Identification of the complete spin systems of all 32 residues was based on TOCSY and NOESY experiments. The peptide secondary structure was delineated from qualitative analysis of the sequential (αCHi–NHi+1 and NHi–NHi+1) and medium range (αCHi–NHi+n, 1 < n < 4, and αCHi–βCHi+3) NOEs. Fig. 4A summarizes the observed NOEs at pH 7.4 and at a concentration of 0.59 mm. The central region of the peptide shows intense NHi–NHi+1 NOEs, whereas the αCHi–NHi+1 connectivities are weaker, implying a generally helical structure (30Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 162-170Google Scholar). This was clearly identified by αCHi-NHi+3, αCHi–NHi+4 and αCHi–βCHi+3 appearing in the region Leu12–Tyr22 (Fig. 4A); the lack of such connectivities at the N- and C-terminal regions suggests a less organized structure. The presence of a helix in the Leu12–Tyr22 region is also supported by 3JHNα < 6 Hz (30Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 162-170Google Scholar). Although without doubt the helical nature in the 12–22 region is established via sequential and medium range NOEs, the differentiation between an α-helix and a 310-helix is, however, more difficult. Actually, the fact that αCHi–NHi+2 connectivities, not observable in an α-helix, are generally detected along the chain and in particular, in the Leu12–Tyr22 region, suggests that we have a 310-helix. On the other hand, the presence of αCHi–NHi+4 connectivities (Leu12–Leu16, Ser13–His17, His17–Thr21, and Lys18–Tyr22), not observable in a 310-helix, also demonstrates that this part of the peptide could take up an α-helix. The simultaneous presence of NOEs peculiar to α- and 310-helices can be interpreted as evidence of flexibility (31Otting G. Qian Y. Müller M. Affolter M. Gehring W. Wüthrich K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4305-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Calculations (see below), however, indicate a preference for the α-helix. The helical wheel diagram (Fig. 4B) indicates that Leu12, Leu16, and Leu19, and Ser13, His17, and Thr21 are positioned on opposite sides of the helix, indicating an amphipatic helix whose hydrophobic face is composed of leucine residues. Three-dimensional structures of LAsCT were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” From the initial 60 structures, 30 were selected for further refinement. They had no violations of the upper and lower bounds of the NMR distance restraints greater than 0.10 and 0.12 nm, respectively, and did not predict any unobserved NOEs. They were subjected to restrained energy minimization using the AMBER package (see “Experimental Procedures”). The energies of these refined structures were all in the narrow range from -3,225 to -3,775 kJ·mol-1. Refinement produced a decrease of the overall energy, but the NOE restraint energies underwent a small increase upon minimization. The overall agreement among individual conformers can be seen by global root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation. The average r.m.s. deviation between the 12 best structure pairs is 0.074 ± 0.016 nm for the backbone atoms in the 9–22 region, and 0.128 ± 0.036 nm including all heavy atoms of the helical region. The average sum of all violations for these structures is 0.76 nm, whereas the average distance restraint violation is 0.0067 nm. Fig. 5A shows a superposition of the polypeptide backbone for the first 12 best structures of LAsCT: a unique backbone fold is obtained for residues 9–22, whereas lack of convergence is instead observed in the C terminus of the hormone and, to a lesser degree, in the N-terminal region. This reflects the absence of a sufficient number of NOEs, mainly due to the inherent flexibility of the molecule (14Amodeo P. Motta A. Strazzullo G. Castiglione Morelli M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In fact, the distribution of the observed NOEs along the LAsCT sequence indicates that the average number of constra"

This tryptophan interacts with the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor BH4, and W457A/F mutations largely reduced the catalytic formation of NO. BH4 decreases the rate of NO rebinding to the ferric iNOSoxy compared with that measured in its absence. The pterin has a larger effect on W457A/F than on the WT protein by increasing NO release from the protein. Therefore, BH4 raises the energy barrier for NO recombination to the mutated proteins in contrast with our observations on eNOS (Slama-Schwok, A., Négrerie, M., Berka, V., Lambry, J.-C., Tsai, A.-L., Vos, M., and Martin, J.-L. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 7581-7586). Thus, we show a differential effect of BH4 on NO release from eNOS and iNOS. Compared with the position of this residue in the BH4-repleted enzyme, simulations of the NO dissociation dynamics point out at a swing of Trp-457 toward the missing pterin in the absence of BH4. NO geminate-rebinding data show a more efficient NO release from eNOS than from iNOS once NO is formed. Consistently, NO produced by iNOS is regulated by its ferric nitrosyl complex in contrast with eNOS. We show that the small enhancement of the NO geminate recombination rate in W457A/F compared with that in the WT enzyme cannot explain the decrease of NO yield because of the mutation; the major effect of the mutation thus arises from an uncoupled catalysis (Wang, Z. Q., Wei, C. C., Ghosh, S., Meade, A. L., Hemann, C., Hille, R., and Stuehr, D. J. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12819-12825).

High NO concentrations counter pathogens by their cytotoxicity and taking part in the response of the immune system. In contrast, the constitutive isoforms, the neuronal nNOS and, especially, the endothelial eNOS produce NO at low concentrations, which acts as a physiological signal in vasorelaxation, neurotransmission, and oxygen detection (1Stuehr D.J.

The NOS enzymes utilize NADPH as a donor of electrons, arginine, and oxygen as co-substrates (2Alderton W. Cooper C.E. Knowles R.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 593-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (3239) Google Scholar). The cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin BH4 is required for NO production and strongly decreases the level of superoxide ions formed by NOS in its absence (3Rusche K.M. Spiering M.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The binding of BH4 to iNOS has structural effects in promoting the enzyme dimerization (4Abou-Soud H.M.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). According to the x-ray structures of iNOS oxygenase domain, BH4 makes hydrogen bonds with the heme propionate and extensive interactions with the residues Trp-455, Trp-457, Phe-470, Arg-375, and Arg-193 (13Crane B.R.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12826-12832Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutation of the residues located near the BH4 binding site in the oxygenase domain of iNOS shows that hydrogen bonding and stacking modify the extent of dimer formation, the heme environment, and the efficiency of NO synthesis. Specifically, the mutation of Trp-457 into Phe and Ala allowed for dimerization but decreased the NO synthesis activity 3.3-fold and 8-fold, respectively (17Ghosh D.K. Wolan D. Adak S. Crane B.R.

Single-turnover experiments using these mutated proteins followed the formation and decay of Fe(II)-O2 and the BH4 radical as intermediates, yielding the ferric complex as the final species (18Wang Z.Q.

Chem. 2002; 277: 12830-12837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These studies showed that Trp-457 ensured a correct rate of electron transfer from BH4 to Fe(II)-O2 in the presence of arginine, which maximized the extent of N-hydroxyarginine formed. In the second step of catalysis, Trp-457 modulated the kinetics of N-hydroxyarginine oxidation by iNOS, although the BH4 radical was not detectable (in the millisecond time scale). However, the rate of Fe(II)-O2 decay was coupled with the rate of citrulline formation. The amount of citrulline per heme decreased to 54 and 38% in W457F and W457A, respectively, compared with the wild type. Several publications characterized a reversible inhibition of iNOS related to the heme binding of self-generated NO. During steady-state catalysis, the ferric nitrosyl complex mainly accumulated, whereas during the first seconds of catalysis, the ferrous-NO complex has also been detected (12Hurshman A.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Abou-Soud H.M Ichimori K. Nakazawa H. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6876-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Heme-NO complex buildup was biphasic, with a fast “pre-equilibrium” phase of all newly formed NO binding to the ferric NOS heme before leaving the active site. This phase accounted for about 30% of the absorption changes, whereas a slower phase occurring in the tens of seconds reflected the binding of NO that builds up in solution to the ferric heme. Modeling studies of NOS catalysis could reproduce these phases (21Santolini J. Meade A.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48887-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this report, we study the geminate recombination of NO to the ferric and ferrous states of iNOSoxy (WT). NO recombines much faster to the ferrous heme than to the ferric heme of iNOS, in contrast with eNOS. This fact is consistent with the specificity of the catalysis of both isoforms. We also found differential effects of the tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor on NO release from iNOS and eNOS. These results are discussed from the perspective of simulations of the molecular dynamics. We also studied the mutated proteins W457F and W457A to check whether the large decrease in NO yield induced by the Trp mutation can be partly accounted for by modifications of NO release. Our results clearly show that the mutation has a minimal effect on the rate and extent of NO release and mainly reduces the efficiency of the catalysis. Materials—l-arginine, (6R)5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), as well as chemicals used for the HEPES buffer, DTT, sodium dithionite, potassium ferricyanide, and glycerol were purchased from Sigma. NO gas diluted at 1% or 10% in argon, pure NO (99.999%) and high purity argon (99.9995%) were obtained from Air Product or Alpha Gaz. Expression of the Enzymes—Wild-type and mutant iNOSoxy Δ-65 proteins (amino acids 66-498 plus a six His tag extension at the C terminus) were over-expressed in BL21 cells using the pCWori vector and purified as reported previously (17Ghosh D.K. Wolan D. Adak S. Crane B.R. Kwon N.S. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24100-24112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Preparation of Samples for Spectroscopy—A concentrated solution of wild-type iNOSoxy or Trp-457 mutants (at a final concentration of 67 μm) in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, and 5% glycerol was mixed with 1 or 20 mm arginine in an optical cuvette with a 1-mm path length. It was sealed with a rubber stopper and degassed by repetitive cycles of vacuum and argon. Anaerobic solutions of 1 mm BH4 and DTT (3 mm final concentration) were added to the protein containing arginine when BH4-repleted samples were needed. The concentration of BH4 was determined by its absorbance at 298 nm (ϵ298 = 9.4 × 103m-1 cm-1) measured in the HEPES buffer at pH = 7.5 and found to be similar to the reported value (22Eberlein G. Bruice T.C. Lazarus R.A. Henrie R. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 7916-7924Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The solution was then incubated overnight on ice to allow completeness of the equilibration. NO gas was then introduced in the cell at a pressure of 1.3 bar using a gas train. When experiments with the reduced enzyme were performed, a slight molar excess of dithionite solution (that was previously titrated with potassium ferricyanide) was used. Depending on the NO concentration used, it was sometimes necessary to add more dithionite (2 to 3 equivalents) to achieve a stable ferrous-nitrosyl complex during the course of our laser experiment. Time-resolved Spectroscopy—Time-resolved spectroscopy was performed with a 30 Hz pump-probe laser set-up described previously (23Martin J.L. Vos M.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 199-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Photodissociation of NO-bound iNOS was achieved by an excitation pulse at 582 nm, with a pulse width of 40 fs. The transient spectrum detected after a variable delay was probed with a white light continuum pulse, whose group velocity dispersion was minimized at 400 nm by a set of prisms. The wavelength calibration of the charge-coupled device camera was checked every day by using a thin-band filter. 25 scans were simultaneously recorded in three time windows: 50 ps, 500 ps, and 2 or 4 ns. Carbon monoxide bound to reduced myoglobin was monitored under the same conditions and used as a reference of flat kinetics in the time scales of 500 ps to 4 ns (24Petrich. J. Poyart C. Martin J.-L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4049-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Analysis of the data was performed by singular matrix decomposition of the time-wavelength matrix (25Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1988Google Scholar). Molecular Dynamics Simulations—The modeling was performed by using the CHARMM27 software on an HP J5600 computer. The calculations used the file for Protein Data Bank ID code 1NSI (26Li H. Raman C.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26916) Google Scholar). The dimer was composed of two identical chains of 431 residues each, two iron protoporphyrins, one Zn atom at the dimer interface, two NO ligands, two BH4 and arginine molecules, 279 water molecules from the x-ray data, to which a “bath” of 4035 water molecules was added. Hydrogen atoms were generated by using the CHARMM HBUILD command. The energy of the structure was minimized. A relative di-electric constant equal to unity was applied to the entire structure. The equations of motion were numerically integrated using the Verlet algorithm with 1-fs time steps. To prepare simulations, an initial heating from 0 to 300°K was performed, and the speed of the atoms was calculated according to a Maxwell distribution. An equilibration at 300°K was then achieved in five steps of 50 ps each, allowing us to obtain a stable starting structure to perform the simulations of the NO dissociation. To simulate NO dissociation, the sudden approximation was used, by deleting the Fe-NO bond. The structure was allowed to relax during 10 to 20 ps, by incremental steps of 1 fs. Four trajectories of 10 ps, representing eight dissociation events, were performed for BH4-bound iNOSoxy. Two trajectories of 10 and 20 ps were calculated for iNOSoxy without cofactor. Steady-state Absorption—The wild-type iNOSoxy protein presents a maximum of the Soret band at λmax = 422 nm without substrate and the BH4 cofactor. This peak accounts for the low spin state of the sample. The addition of 20 mm arginine alone induces a partial shift from 422 nm to a broad maximum of the Soret band around 402 nm and a marked shoulder at 422 nm (29Hurshman A.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3439-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Addition of 1 mm of BH4 in the presence of DTT completely shifts the protein to high spin: the Soret band then peaks at 395 nm (5Rusche K.M. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 421-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). NO binding shifts the Soret maximum to 440 nm, and two Q bands are observed at 548 and 575 nm (Fig. 1). The NO complexes of the protein in the presence of arginine alone or with both arginine and BH4 are stable. Transient Absorption—Our laser set-up allowed us to cleave selectively the iron-NO bond by excitation of the complex at 582 nm, a wavelength located within one of the Q bands of the nitrosyl complex (λmax = 575 nm). This bond cleavage is effective within the pulse width (40 fs). We then followed the absorption changes associated with NO rebinding to the heme. These changes corresponded to an absorption difference at a given time relative to that before the laser shot. In our experiment, we measured the geminate recombination that involves the rebinding of photo-dissociated NO molecules prior to their escape from the protein into the solvent. This takes place in the time scale of a few ps to 4 ns. We did not follow the slower phase, occurring in milliseconds, because of NO recombination with the heme after its escape into the solvent, which is a bimolecular reaction. The transient spectrum presented a maximum absorption at 397 nm, a bleaching with a minimum at 442 nm, and two isosbestic points at 421 and 469 nm (Fig. 1). This result held true with or without 1 mm BH4. These spectral features are characteristic of the ferric unliganded iNOSoxy with some quantitative differences. The steady-state difference spectrum presents the same extrema, but the intensity of the peak at 397 nm is somewhat smaller than the transient one, and the isosbestic point is blue-shifted to 418 nm. The latter differences are more marked in the absence of BH4 (data not shown). Thus, in the steady state, there is a mixed population between low- and high-spin species, depending on the BH4 content in the absence of NO. Once NO is bound, the ferric species turn to purely high spin, evidenced in the transient spectra. They retain their shape, and their amplitude decreases with time. Thus, the kinetics is associated with the decay of the same ferric species in a high-spin state that undergoes geminate recombination. The geminate recombination of NO to the ferric heme of iNOSoxy involves two phases: a fast phase occurring in picoseconds, and a slower step taking place in nanoseconds (Fig. 2). This multi-exponential decay does not come from the heterogeneity in the dimer population. Indeed, the concentration of 70 μm of protein used in our experiments insured that iNOSoxy and W457A/F were dimeric. Indeed, 0.1 μm protein already formed 60, 70, and >90% dimer, respectively, for W457F, W457A, and iNOSoxy in the presence of 20 mm arginine (17Ghosh D.K. Wolan D. Adak S. Crane B.R. Kwon N.S. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24100-24112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The fast phase is best fitted by two exponentials, τ1 = 50 ± 5 ps, and τ2 = 425 ± 25 ps; the long component is τ3 = 1.7 ± 0.2 ns, obtained with arginine and the cofactor. The A4 asymptotic value represents the upper limit of the probability of NO escape from the protein without rebinding. Thus, about 13% of the photodissociated NO molecules are able to escape geminate recombination in the presence of arginine. The rate of NO rebinding to the heme depended upon the BH4 concentration (Fig. 2). The extent of decay decreased in the tens of picoseconds but increased in the hundreds of picoseconds in the absence of BH4, compared with that at 1 mm BH4. In addition, the lifetimes τ1 and τ2 are larger with the cofactor than without (Fig. 2A and Table I). Similar results were obtained by changing the arginine concentration from 20 mm to 1 mm, while BH4 was kept constant at 1 mm (data not shown). Nonetheless, the kinetics reached a similar extent of decay after about 2 ns, i.e. 80% decay independently of the BH4 concentration used. The kinetics were independent of the NO concentration in the range 1-10% in the gas phase (Table I and data not shown).Table IKinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the main singular value decomposition component with three exponents and a constant The kinetic experiments were performed using 67 μm of the oxygenase domain of the enzymes iNOSoxy wild type (WT) or W457F/A mutants, 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, and 5% glycerol.SampleArginineBH4τ1A1aRelative amplitude, A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 = 1, not including the amplitude of the transient due to the excited stateτ2A2aRelative amplitude, A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 = 1, not including the amplitude of the transient due to the excited stateτ3A3aRelative amplitude, A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 = 1, not including the amplitude of the transient due to the excited stateA4aRelative amplitude, A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 = 1, not including the amplitude of the transient due to the excited statemmmmpspspsWTbNO 10% in the gas phase200300.322860.3832000.200.12WTcNO 1% in the gas phase200340.323250.3631800.190.13WTbNO 10% in the gas phase201500.154250.4817100.240.13W457AbNO 10% in the gas phase200200.391380.3411070.170.10W457bNO 10% in the gas phase201440.182100.367400.210.25W457FbNO 10% in the gas phase200240.372020.3620000.150.12W457FcNO 1% in the gas phase200330.271930.3817040.170.18W457FbNO 10% in the gas phase201550.262650.3420930.170.23WT redcNO 1% in the gas phase2010420.342140.3717220.270.02WT redbNO 10% in the gas phase2010380.342050.3415900.320W457A redbNO 10% in the gas phase201280.553380.410.04W457A redbNO 10% in the gas phase2010340.523560.420.06W457F reddNO 0.1% in the gas phase201320.543140.430.03W457F redcNO 1% in the gas phase201400.584830.420.09W457F redbNO 10% in the gas phase201350.542830.400.06a Relative amplitude, A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 = 1, not including the amplitude of the transient due to the excited stateb NO 10% in the gas phasec NO 1% in the gas phased NO 0.1% in the gas phase Open table in a new tab The affinity for both arginine and BH4 was lower for the mutated proteins W457A/F than for the wild type (17Ghosh D.K. Wolan D. Adak S. Crane B.R. Kwon N.S. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24100-24112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We measured the absorbance of the Soret band of W457A at different concentrations of BH4 in the presence of 20 mm arginine. The shift from 423 to 395 nm was nearly reached at 1 mm BH4; it was achieved at 3 mm BH4 (data not shown). The geminate recombination was clearly much faster without than with 1 mm BH4, following a similar qualitative trend as that seen for the wild-type protein (Fig. 2, A and B and Table I). A large effect of BH4 is observed in the first exponential, both in its lifetime varying from τ1 = 20 to 44 ps and in its amplitude A1 = 0.39 to 0.18 in the absence/presence of BH4 respectively. The addition of 1 mm BH4 also increased the constant term compared with that obtained in BH4-free solutions (Fig. 2B and Table I). This contrasts with the lack of such an effect in the wild-type enzyme. The mutated protein W457F followed a similar behavior than W457A with respect to the effect of BH4 on the geminate recombination rate (Table I). The transient absorption of the reduced iNOS is red-shifted to 407 nm compared with that of the oxidized protein peaking at 397 nm. This maximum at 407 nm is close to that observed in the steady-state absorption λmax = 410 nm. The geminate recombination of NO to the reduced heme, shown in Fig. 3, is best fitted by three exponential terms, τ1 = 40 ± 2 ps, τ2 = 210 ± 10 ps, and τ3 = 1650 ± 80 ps. The same parameters were obtained within experimental error at either 1 or 10 mm BH4 in the presence of dithionite (data not shown). The constant term is close to zero, thus none of the dissociated NO molecules escaped geminate recombination when the heme was in its ferrous state. Fig. 3A compares the geminate rebinding of NO to iNOS as a function of its redox state. The rate of NO rebinding to the ferrous heme is faster relative to that of the corresponding ferric species. The pre-exponential term A1 increases from 0.15 to 0.34, and the second lifetime τ2 decreases from 425 to 210 ps in the ferric compared with the ferrous state. Moreover, the NO rebinding is complete when the heme is reduced, in contrast with a probability reaching 13% of NO escape from rebinding for the oxidized species. Fig. 3B shows that the extent of NO recombination is much lower in eNOS enzyme than in iNOS. The effect of the redox state on the geminate rebinding of both NOS isoforms will be discussed below. Fig. 4A compares the geminate recombination of NO to the three proteins in the presence of both arginine and BH4. Under these conditions, all three samples formed the ferric high-spin unliganded heme after photo-dissociation (Figs. 1 and 2A). The kinetics of NO rebinding differ in the hundreds of picoseconds: τ2 = 425 ± 30 ps for the wild type compared with τ2 = 230 ± 30 ps for W457A/F. The constant term increases somewhat, from 13 to 24% by mutation of W to A or F, respectively (Fig. 2 and Table I). Fig. 4B compares the rebinding of NO to the reduced proteins in the presence of arginine and BH4. The kinetics of NO rebinding to either W457A/F are very similarly fitted by two exponential terms, τ1 = 34 ± 6 ps and τ2 = 350 ± 70 ps and a constant one. These decays are much faster than that obtained with the wild-type protein, especially in the tens of picoseconds. The weight of the first exponential term largely increases from 0.34 in iNOSoxy to 0.54 in both W457A and W457F. As shown in Table I, the recombination of NO to the ferrous heme does not depend on the NO concentration in the range 0.1-10%. Simulations of the dynamics of NO dissociation were performed by using the structure of BH4-bound iNOSoxy (Protein Data Bank ID code 1NSI) (26Li H. Raman C.S. Glaser B.E. Young T.A. Parkinson J.F.

Fig. 5 shows the structure of the reduced heme in the presence of arginine and pterin represented in red. Superimposed is the structure simulated in the absence of the cofactor depicted in blue. The pterin site is left empty by the absence of BH4. To the best of our knowledge, there is no experimental evidence showing that the arginine is able to replace the missing pterin, as it occurs in eNOS (30Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P. Kral V. Masters B.S.S. Poulos T. Cell. 1998; 95: 939-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The two simulated structures differ in the tilt of Trp-457 when the pterin site remains vacant and in some accommodation of the heme propionate chains. Fig. 5 also shows the position of NO, depicted in green (N atom) and magenta (oxygen atom) after a typical trajectory of 10 ps. The ligand remained confined in the heme pocket. The same dynamics were obtained independently of the presence of the pterin, suggesting that NO rebinding to the ferrous heme does not depend on the pterin, at least for 10-20 ps. Effect of BH4on NO Rebinding to the Ferric Heme of iNOSoxy and W457A/F—Our transient absorption measurements probe the rebinding of NO to the heme once it is photodissociated; only intra-protein dynamics are relevant in the investigated time scales. The picosecond phase corresponds to NO rebinding that did not leave the heme pocket, whereas the nanosecond phase reflects the rebinding of NO molecules that left the heme pocket but were still in the protein. The former phase is probably lacking activation energy, whereas the latter process has to overcome an energy barrier. The upper limit of the probability of NO escape from the protein is given by the A4 asymptotic value (Table I). The geminate recombination rate is decreased in the picosecond range by the presence of BH4, compared with BH4-depleted proteins (Fig. 2A). This effect is enhanced in the mutated proteins. This clearly points to a rearrangement of the heme pocket induced by the pterin. No structure is available for BH4-depleted iNOSoxy. Thus, we simulated the molecular dynamics based on the structure of BH4-bound iNOSoxy to which the pterin was removed (Protein Data Bank ID code 1NSI; Ref. 26Li H. Raman C.S. Glaser B.E. Young T.A.

The calculations, made on the ferrous nitrosyl, suggest a tilt of Trp-457 toward the vacant site of the missing pterin, compared with its position adopted in the presence of BH4. The heme propionates adapt their position adequately to Trp-457 rotation (Fig. 5). Th"

Recent evidence indicates that Raf signaling also may contribute to myoblast cell cycle exit and cytoprotection. To further define the mechanisms by which Raf participates in cellular responses, a stable line of myoblasts expressing an estrogen receptor-Raf chimeric protein was created. The cells (23A2RafERDD) demonstrate a strict concentration-dependent increase in chimeric Raf protein synthesis and downstream phosphoMAPK activation. Initiation of low-level Raf activity in these cells augments contractile protein expression and myocyte fusion. By contrast, induction of high level Raf activity in 23A2RafERDD myoblasts inhibits the formation of myocytes and muscle reporter gene expression. Interestingly, treatment of myoblasts with conditioned medium isolated from Raf-repressive cells inhibits all of the aspects of myogenesis. Closer examination indicates that the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) gene is up-regulated in Raf-repressive myoblasts. The cells also direct elevated levels of Smad transcriptional activity, suggesting the existence of a TGF-β1 autocrine loop. However, extinguishing the biological activity of TGF-β1 does not restore the myogenic program.

The mechanism by which these soluble inhibitory proteins impede skeletal myogenesis involves the activation of specific intracellular signaling cascades. In the case of TGF-β1, a requisite induction of Smad3 protein phosphorylation and nuclear translocation occurs that interferes with muscle gene transcription (9.Liu D. Black B.L. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2950-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism for FGF2-mediated inhibition of myogenesis is less understood but may involve downstream signaling events that are controlled through G-proteins (10.Fedorov Y.V. Jones N.C.

Overexpression studies and application of specific kinase inhibitors has led to the identification of several essential signaling pathways in skeletal myoblasts. It is firmly established that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p38, a stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), both are necessary for the formation of mature myocytes (11.Cuenda A.

Removal of downstream signaling events by the respective kinases through the use of chemical inhibitors abolishes myogenesis. By contrast, initiation of downstream signaling modules by constitutively active Ras, a membrane-localized GTPase that participates in numerous receptor tyrosine kinase-initiated signaling events, results in a severe reduction in muscle gene transcription and myoblast fusion (16.Kong Y.

Interestingly, the means by which Ras and Raf inhibit muscle gene expression does not appear to be directly dependent upon the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Inhibition of MEK/ERK signal transduction does not reinstate the full complement of muscle gene transcription and myoblast fusion to myoblasts expressing constitutively active Ras or Raf (17.Ramocki M.B.

Raf kinase is a serine/threonine kinase whose activation precludes ERK1/2 (MAPK) phosphorylation and a concomitant alteration in gene transcription (23.Herrera R. Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S27-S31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24.Hindley A. Kolch W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling through the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is a common mitogenic response for many cell types. Recently, several groups have reported differential cellular responses as a consequence of Raf/MAPK signal intensity. At lower levels of MAPK activity, epithelial and fibroblasts demonstrate increased proliferative rates (25.Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1636-1640PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). By contrast, high levels of Raf/MAPK result in cell cycle arrest and senescence (26.Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 27.Schulze A. Lehmann K. Jefferies H.B. McMahon M. Downward J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The Raf-mediated responses are attributed to signaling through MEK/MAPK as well as non-MEK-dependent signaling events. Regulation of Raf activity indicates that the protein physically associates with other kinases, regulatory proteins, and scaffolding proteins (for review see Ref. 28.Chong H. Vikis H.G. Guan K.L. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has become increasingly apparent that Raf kinase can control cellular transcriptional responses through mechanisms that are independent of the archetypical MEK/ERK module. A Raf kinase allele that fails to interact with MEK and cause ERK1/2 phosphorylation retained the ability to activate NFκB-directed transcription and promote neuronal differentiation (29.Pearson G. Bumeister R. Henry D.O. Cobb M.H. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37303-37306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results argue that Raf participates in several downstream signaling cascades. Differential utilization of these pathways may be reflected in the decision of the cell to undergo proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and senescence. Because many growth factors exhibit contrasting effects on skeletal myogenesis yet utilize many of the same intracellular signaling pathways, it is likely that signal intensity plays a critical role in the decision to complete terminal differentiation. To this end, myoblasts that express an inducible activated Raf allele were created. Our results indicate that low level Raf activity promotes myogenesis, whereas high level Raf activity inhibits muscle formation. Coincident with repression of differentiation by activated Raf is an increase in TGF-β1 gene expression and Smad-directed transcriptional activity. However, the removal of TGF-β1 from the extracellular environment of the Raf-repressive myoblasts does not reinstate the differentiation program. In summary, Raf signaling modules are both positive and negative mediators of myogenesis that is a direct reflection of signal strength. Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Transfections—23A2RafERDD myoblasts were created by transduction of 23A2 myoblasts with a retrovirus encoding the fusion protein RafERDD (30.Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). RafERDD is comprised of the kinase domain of human c-Raf-1 fused in-frame with the estrogen receptor ligand binding domain. Following infection, the cells were selected in puromycin and clones were isolated by limiting dilution. 23A2 and 23A2RafERDD myoblasts were cultured on gelatinized tissue culture grade plasticware in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.5% Geneticin (Invitrogen). Differentiation was induced in confluent cultures by continuous culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 2% horse serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.5% Geneticin. For the measurement of muscle-specific reporter gene activity, myogenic cells cultured in 6-well tissue plasticware were transiently transfected with 1 μg of troponin I luciferase (TnI-Luc), the minimal E-box reporter plasmid, 4Rtk-Luc, or a multimerized AP-1 binding site reporter (AP-1-Luc) and 50 ng of pRL-tk, a Renilla luciferase plasmid as a monitor of transfection efficiency, using standard calcium phosphate methods (16.Kong Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27481-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in differentiation media for 48 h in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT, Sigma) prior to lysis and measurement of luciferase activities (Dual-luciferase, Promega, Madison, WI). Inhibition of MEK activity was achieved by supplementation of differentiation medium with 20 μm PD98059. The amount of corrected luciferase activity generated by 23A2 or 23A2RafERDD myoblasts treated with vehicle was set to 100%. Each experiment was replicated a minimum of three times. For conditioned medium experiments, the culture medium was removed from myoblasts treated for 48 h with Me2SO or varying amounts of 4HT. The medium was centrifuged to remove debris and brought to a final concentration of 2% horse serum. The resulting medium was applied to confluent 23A2 myoblasts, and the cells were maintained for an additional 48 h prior to fixation. Heat inactivation of the conditioned medium was performed as described previously (31.Weyman C.M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2521-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation, Northern Blots, and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated with STAT60-denaturing solution per the manufacturer's recommendations (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Twenty micrograms of total RNA were separated through 1% agarose gels containing 2% formaldehyde, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and irreversibly cross-linked to the medium by UV. The blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes generated by random hexamer priming (DecaPrime, Ambion, Houston, TX). The probes corresponded to regions contained within the TGF-β1 and glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene-coding regions. Northern blot analysis was performed using Ultra-Hyb (Ambion) at 42 °C overnight according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Blots were washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS once at room temperature and twice with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. Blots were exposed to phosphorimaging screens for the visualization and quantification of message levels. For the semi-quantitative assessment of mRNA levels, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Amplification of GAPDH and TGF-β1 was performed using Taq polymerase (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), gene-specific primers, and thermocycle conditions of 95 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s for a total of 35 cycles. To ensure that quantification was accomplished in the linear range of amplification, an aliquot was removed from each reaction after 25, 30, and 35 cycles. GDF-8 was amplified as described previously (32.Rios R. Carneiro I. Arce V.M. Devesa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Amplicons were separated through 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, visualized under UV, and photographed. Western Blot and Scanning Densitometry—23A2RafERDD myoblasts were differentiated in the presence or absence of 4HT. After 48 h, the cells were lysed in 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and an aliquot was removed for protein quantification. Equal amounts of protein were electrophoretically separated through denaturing gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) to remove nonspecific binding sites. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer, and the blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with shaking. Antibodies and dilutions included the following: anti-myogenin (F5D ascites, Developmental Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, 1:5000); anti-myosin heavy chain (MF20 hybridoma supernatant, Developmental Hybridoma Bank, 1:5); anti-ERK1/2 and anti-phosphoERK1/2 (Cell Signaling); and anti-estrogen receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, 1:300). After extensive washing with TBST, the blots were reacted with the appropriate peroxidase secondary antibody for 45 min at room temperature. Visualization of protein bands was accomplished by chemiluminescence and autoradiography. Multiple exposures to x-ray film were used to ensure that the linear range of densitometry was maintained. Autoradiograms were scanned on a Storm 860 phosphorimaging system (Molecular Dynamics, Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—23A2 and 23A2RafERDD myocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS, and nonspecific antigen sites were blocked by incubation with 5% horse serum in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. Cultures were incubated with anti-myosin heavy chain (MF20) for 60 min at room temperature. After exhaustive washing with PBS, the cells were reacted with donkey anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, 1:200) for 45 min at room temperature. Cultures were washed with PBS and counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Immunofluorescent detection was accomplished using a Nikon TE200 inverted phase microscope equipped with epifluorescence. Representative photomicrographs were captured to slide film and assembled in Adobe Photoshop. Creation and Characterization of an Inducible Raf Myogenic Cell Line—Previous work has clearly demonstrated that overexpression of activated alleles of Raf are inhibitory to myocyte formation and muscle gene expression (17.Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.L. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 18.Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21.Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, MAPK-dependent repression appears to be a function of Raf signaling intensity in avian myoblasts (18.Dorman C.M. Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To extend these observations, an activated Raf kinase that is responsive to the estrogen analog, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT), was stably expressed in 23A2 mouse myoblasts (23A2RafERDD). Confluent cultures of 23A2RafERDD myoblasts were differentiated in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of 4HT. After 48 h, the cells were lysed for Western analysis of chimeric Raf (α-estrogen receptor), activated MAPK (α-phosphoMAPK), and total MAPK (α-MAPK) expression. As shown in Fig. 1, a dose-dependent increase in the relative amount of RafERDD protein is found with amounts 4HT from 0.25 nm to 2.5 μm (lanes 2–6). Coincident with the increase in chimeric Raf protein is an elevation in the amounts of phosphorylated MAPK. Phosphorylated ERK2 is preferentially activated at 4HT concentrations as low as 0.25 nm, whereas activated ERK1 is first apparent at 4HT concentrations of 25 nm or greater. No differences in the amounts of total MAPK (ERK1/2) were evident. Activation of ERK1/2 signal transmission leads to an increase in AP-1-directed transcriptional activity in many cell types including skeletal myoblasts. To ensure that the Raf/ERK pathway was functional in 23A2RafERDD myoblasts, semiconfluent cells were transiently transfected with a multimerized AP-1 reporter plasmid and pRL-tk, a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase as a marker of transfection efficiency. Subsequently, the cells were treated with increasing amounts of 4HT for 48 h prior to lysis and measurement of luciferase activities. Control 23A2 myoblasts were treated in an analogous fashion. AP-1-Luc reporter activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Results demonstrate a dose-dependent increase in AP-1-Luc activity with increasing amounts of 4HT (Fig. 2). At concentrations of 4HT greater than 250 nm, a decline in AP-1 luciferase activity was evident. Moreover, the response is directly attributed to the induction of RafER activity as 23A2 myoblasts failed to initiate AP-1-transcriptional activity upon treatment with 4HT. These results indicate that the Raf/ERK signaling axis is intact and functional in the myogenic cells. As final confirmation of the integrity of the Raf signaling system in 23A2RafERDD myoblasts, confluent cultures of cells were treated for 48 h in differentiation medium containing vehicle only (Me2SO) or 1 μm 4HT. Subsequently, cells were fixed and immunostained for myosin heavy chain (α-MyHC). Control 23A2RafERDD myocytes treated with vehicle readily differentiate into large multinucleated myofibers that express copious amounts of the contractile protein, MyHC (Fig. 3). By contrast, activation of the Raf/ERK signaling pathway leads to a severe reduction in both myofiber number and MyHC protein expression. These results directly reflect published reports of the effects of activated Raf on skeletal myogenesis. Thus, 23A2RafERDD myoblasts represent a myogenic cell line that retains its muscle features in the absence of Raf activity and is differentiation-defective in the presence of Raf signal transmission. Contrasting Effects of Raf Signal Transduction on Skeletal Myoblasts—To understand the effects of signal intensity of myogenesis, 23A2RafERDD myoblasts were differentiated in the presence of increasing amount of 4HT. After 48 h, the cells were lysed and equal amounts of total cellular proteins were analyzed by Western blot for the expression of muscle proteins (anti-MyHC, anti-myogenin). Scanning densitometry was performed on the chemiluminescent autoradiograms. Muscle protein expression was normalized to total ERK2 expression, an internal marker for protein loading, transfer, and detection efficiency. In the absence of 4HT, 23A2RafERDD myoblasts differentiate into myocytes that express both MyHC and myogenin (Fig. 4). Unexpectedly, low level induction of Raf activity using concentrations of 4HT (0.25 or 2.5 nm) causes an increase in the amount of contractile and regulatory protein expression. Supplementation of differentiation medium with 25 nm 4HT or greater causes the predicted loss of MyHC and myogenin protein expression. The biphasic response of 23A2RafERDD myoblasts to increasing 4HT concentrations is further reflected in muscle-specific reporter gene activity. 23A2 and 23A2RafERDD myoblasts were transiently transfected with TnI-Luc and pRL-tk. After 48 h in differentiation medium supplemented with 4HT, the cells were lysed and luciferase activities were measured. TnI luciferase enzymatic activity did not vary as a function of 4HT treatment in control 23A2 myoblasts, indicating that the estrogen analog does not significantly alter basal muscle gene expression (Fig. 5). The levels of Raf activity directed in response to 25 nm 4HT or greater are sufficient for a reduction in TnI-Luc activity. However, low level Raf activity (0.25–2.5 nm 4HT) directs only a slight increase in muscle reporter gene activity. It is likely that a larger portion of the TnI regulatory region is necessary to obtain a substantial increase in reporter gene transcription. Our results clearly demonstrate that Raf has contrasting effects on muscle formation that are intensity-dependent.Fig. 5Raf activation alters two distinct phases of myogenesis. 23A2 and 23A2RafERDD myoblasts transiently transfected with TnI-Luc and pRL-tk were cultured in differentiation medium supplemented with increasing concentrations of 4HT. TnI-Luc was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. The amount of reporter activity directed by 23A2 myocytes in the absence of 4HT was set to 100%. Low level Raf activity causes a slight increase in muscle reporter gene activity, whereas high level Raf activity inhibits myogenesis. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments.

Johnson S.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33.Johnson S.E. Dorman C.M. Bolanowski S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28742-28748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To determine the role of MEK in the RafER-imposed block to myogenesis, confluent 23A2RafERDD myoblasts were transiently transfected with TnI-Luc and pRL-tk. The myoblasts were treated for 48 h with increasing amounts of 4HT and 20 μm PD98059 or vehicle only. Cell lysates were collected, and luciferase activities were measured. The amount of muscle reporter gene activity directed in the absence of 4HT and the chemical MEK inhibitor was set to 1. As expected, the selected concentrations of 4HT caused a reduction in the amount of TnI-Luc reporter activation (Fig. 6). Suppression of MEK function restored muscle gene transcription as evidenced by an increase in TnI-Luc activity to levels comparable to controls. However, strong stimulation of Raf signaling initiated by 2.5 μm 4HT was refractile to the effects of the MEK inhibitor. Western analysis of replica samples demonstrates that treatment with PD98059 reinstates myosin heavy chain expression to levels <10% of controls (data not shown). These results duplicate previous observations using constitutive Raf alleles of various signaling intensities (21.Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Johnson S.E. Dorman C.M. Bolanowski S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28742-28748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Raf Inhibition of Myogenesis Involves Secretion of a Soluble Factor—It has been reported that the inability of myoblasts to differentiate in the presence of activated Raf is a product of sequestration of MEF2 in the cytoplasm (21.Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, forced expression of the transcription factor in avian myoblasts does not reinstate the muscle gene program, arguing that additional factors are involved (33.Johnson S.E. Dorman C.M. Bolanowski S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28742-28748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Moreover, rhabdomyosarcoma cells secrete bioactive TGF-β1 that acts in an autocrine manner to suppress differentiation (34.Bouche M. Canipari R. Melchionna R. Willems D. Senni M.I. Molinaro M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1147-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To further characterize the differentiation-defective phenotype of myoblasts directing extreme levels of Raf/ERK signal, conditioned medium was collected from 23A2RafERDD myoblasts that were treated with Me2SO, 2.5 nm 4HT, or 2.5 μm 4HT in differentiation medium. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were supplemented with horse serum to a final concentration of 2%. An aliquot of conditioned medium isolated from the 2.5 μm of treatment group was heat-inactivated prior to supplementation with horse serum (31.Weyman C.M. Wolfman A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2521-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Confluent cultures of 23A2 myoblasts were allowed to differentiate for 48 h in the conditioned medium followed by fixation and immunostaining for MyHC. Control cultures were treated with Me2SO, 2.5 nm 4HT, or 2.5 μm 4HT and analyzed as described. Conditioned medium from 23A2RafERDD myoblasts differentiated in the presence or absence of 2.5 nm 4HT did not alter the ability of myoblasts to fuse into MyHC-positive myofibers (Fig. 7). By contrast, medium harvested from 23A2RafERDD myoblasts treated with 2.5 μm 4HT dramatically inhibited myocyte formati"
