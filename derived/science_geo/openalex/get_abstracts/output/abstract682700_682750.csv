https://openalex.org/W3206986155,"Atomically ordered intermetallic nanoparticles are promising for catalytic applications but are difficult to produce because the high-temperature annealing required for atom ordering inevitably accelerates metal sintering that leads to larger crystallites. We prepared platinum intermetallics with an average particle size of <5 nanometers on porous sulfur-doped carbon supports, on which the strong interaction between platinum and sulfur suppresses metal sintering up to 1000°C. We synthesized intermetallic libraries of small nanoparticles consisting of 46 combinations of platinum with 16 other metal elements and used them to study the dependence of electrocatalytic oxygen-reduction reaction activity on alloy composition and platinum skin strain. The intermetallic libraries are highly mass efficient in proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells and could achieve high activities of 1.3 to 1.8 amperes per milligram of platinum at 0.9 volts."

We deciphered the water-filling mechanism for the state-of-the-art water-harvesting metal-organic framework MOF-303 by performing an extensive series of single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements and density functional theory calculations. The first water molecules strongly bind to the polar organic linkers; they are followed by additional water molecules forming isolated clusters, then chains of clusters, and finally a water network. This evolution of water structures led us to modify the pores by the multivariate approach, thereby precisely modulating the binding strength of the first water molecules and deliberately shaping the water uptake behavior. This resulted in higher water productivity, as well as tunability of regeneration temperature and enthalpy, without compromising capacity and stability."
https://openalex.org/W3205927750,"Although solid-state lithium (Li)-metal batteries promise both high energy density and safety, existing solid ion conductors fail to satisfy the rigorous requirements of battery operations. Inorganic ion conductors allow fast ion transport, but their rigid and brittle nature prevents good interfacial contact with electrodes. Conversely, polymer ion conductors that are Li-metal-stable usually provide better interfacial compatibility and mechanical tolerance, but typically suffer from inferior ionic conductivity owing to the coupling of the ion transport with the motion of the polymer chains1-3. Here we report a general strategy for achieving high-performance solid polymer ion conductors by engineering of molecular channels. Through the coordination of copper ions (Cu2+) with one-dimensional cellulose nanofibrils, we show that the opening of molecular channels within the normally ion-insulating cellulose enables rapid transport of Li+ ions along the polymer chains. In addition to high Li+ conductivity (1.5 × 10-3 siemens per centimetre at room temperature along the molecular chain direction), the Cu2+-coordinated cellulose ion conductor also exhibits a high transference number (0.78, compared with 0.2-0.5 in other polymers2) and a wide window of electrochemical stability (0-4.5 volts) that can accommodate both the Li-metal anode and high-voltage cathodes. This one-dimensional ion conductor also allows ion percolation in thick LiFePO4 solid-state cathodes for application in batteries with a high energy density. Furthermore, we have verified the universality of this molecular-channel engineering approach with other polymers and cations, achieving similarly high conductivities, with implications that could go beyond safe, high-performance solid-state batteries."
https://openalex.org/W3163838900,"The progression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in Africa has so far been heterogeneous, and the full impact is not yet well understood. In this study, we describe the genomic epidemiology using a dataset of 8746 genomes from 33 African countries and two overseas territories. We show that the epidemics in most countries were initiated by importations predominantly from Europe, which diminished after the early introduction of international travel restrictions. As the pandemic progressed, ongoing transmission in many countries and increasing mobility led to the emergence and spread within the continent of many variants of concern and interest, such as B.1.351, B.1.525, A.23.1, and C.1.1. Although distorted by low sampling numbers and blind spots, the findings highlight that Africa must not be left behind in the global pandemic response, otherwise it could become a source for new variants."
https://openalex.org/W3205872415,"Dietary interventions can change metabolite levels in the tumour microenvironment, which might then affect cancer cell metabolism to alter tumour growth1–5. Although caloric restriction (CR) and a ketogenic diet (KD) are often thought to limit tumour progression by lowering blood glucose and insulin levels6–8, we found that only CR inhibits the growth of select tumour allografts in mice, suggesting that other mechanisms contribute to tumour growth inhibition. A change in nutrient availability observed with CR, but not with KD, is lower lipid levels in the plasma and tumours. Upregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), which synthesises monounsaturated fatty acids, is required for cancer cells to proliferate in a lipid-depleted environment, and CR also impairs tumour SCD activity to cause an imbalance between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids to slow tumour growth. Enforcing cancer cell SCD expression or raising circulating lipid levels through a higher-fat CR diet confers resistance to the effects of CR. By contrast, although KD also impairs tumour SCD activity, KD-driven increases in lipid availability maintain the unsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratios in tumours, and changing the KD fat composition to increase tumour saturated fatty acid levels cooperates with decreased tumour SCD activity to slow tumour growth. These data suggest that diet-induced mismatches between tumour fatty acid desaturation activity and the availability of specific fatty acid species determine whether low glycaemic diets impair tumour growth. Lien et al. show that low glycemic diets can reduce tumour growth by deregulating lipid metabolism."

Zhang et al . use laser powder bed fusion to combine small amounts of 316L stainless steel into Ti64 titanium alloy. This process creates an alloy with a distinctive microstructure that retains high strength while substantially improving ductility. The design strategy should be useful for improving mechanical properties in other alloy system as well. —BG

Looking at postmortem brain samples from patients affected by any of several neurodegenerative disorders, Terreros-Roncal et al . investigated whether adult neurogenesis was disrupted (see the Perspective by Gage). Indeed, functions of the neurogenic niche shifted and the cells produced were abnormal in shape and differentiation. The neuronal plasticity characteristic of the hippocampus may make it especially susceptible to the ravages of neurodegenerative disease. —PJH"
https://openalex.org/W3207841857,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants is jeopardizing the effectiveness of current vaccines and limiting the application of monoclonal antibody-based therapy for COVID-19 (refs. 1,2). Here we analysed the memory B cells of five naive and five convalescent people vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to investigate the nature of the B cell and antibody response at the single-cell level. Almost 6,000 cells were sorted, over 3,000 cells produced monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein and more than 400 cells neutralized the original SARS-CoV-2 virus first identified in Wuhan, China. The B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.1.248 (Gamma) variants escaped almost 70% of these antibodies, while a much smaller portion was impacted by the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants. The overall loss of neutralization was always significantly higher in the antibodies from naive people. In part, this was due to the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline, which was found only in people who were convalescent and generated potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies. Our data suggest that people who are seropositive following infection or primary vaccination will produce antibodies with increased potency and breadth and will be able to better control emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants."
https://openalex.org/W3206272465,"Domestication of horses fundamentally transformed long-range mobility and warfare1. However, modern domesticated breeds do not descend from the earliest domestic horse lineage associated with archaeological evidence of bridling, milking and corralling2-4 at Botai, Central Asia around 3500 BC3. Other longstanding candidate regions for horse domestication, such as Iberia5 and Anatolia6, have also recently been challenged. Thus, the genetic, geographic and temporal origins of modern domestic horses have remained unknown. Here we pinpoint the Western Eurasian steppes, especially the lower Volga-Don region, as the homeland of modern domestic horses. Furthermore, we map the population changes accompanying domestication from 273 ancient horse genomes. This reveals that modern domestic horses ultimately replaced almost all other local populations as they expanded rapidly across Eurasia from about 2000 BC, synchronously with equestrian material culture, including Sintashta spoke-wheeled chariots. We find that equestrianism involved strong selection for critical locomotor and behavioural adaptations at the GSDMC and ZFPM1 genes. Our results reject the commonly held association7 between horseback riding and the massive expansion of Yamnaya steppe pastoralists into Europe around 3000 BC8,9 driving the spread of Indo-European languages10. This contrasts with the scenario in Asia where Indo-Iranian languages, chariots and horses spread together, following the early second millennium BC Sintashta culture11,12."

We report a processing strategy that uses cell wall engineering to shape flat sheets of hardwood into versatile three-dimensional (3D) structures. After breaking down wood’s lignin component and closing the vessels and fibers by evaporating water, we partially re-swell the wood in a rapid water-shock process that selectively opens the vessels. This forms a distinct wrinkled cell wall structure that allows the material to be folded and molded into desired shapes. The resulting 3D-molded wood is six times stronger than the starting wood and comparable to widely used lightweight materials such as aluminum alloys. This approach widens wood’s potential as a structural material, with lower environmental impact for buildings and transportation applications."

https://openalex.org/W3206813102,"Tumours use various strategies to evade immune surveillance1,2. Immunotherapies targeting tumour immune evasion such as immune checkpoint blockade have shown considerable efficacy on multiple cancers3,4 but are ineffective for most patients due to primary or acquired resistance5–7. Recent studies showed that some epigenetic regulators suppress anti-tumour immunity2,8–12, suggesting that epigenetic therapies could boost anti-tumour immune responses and overcome resistance to current immunotherapies. Here we show that, in mouse melanoma models, depletion of KDM5B—an H3K4 demethylase that is critical for melanoma maintenance and drug resistance13–15—induces robust adaptive immune responses and enhances responses to immune checkpoint blockade. Mechanistically, KDM5B recruits the H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 to repress endogenous retroelements such as MMVL30 in a demethylase-independent manner. Derepression of these retroelements activates cytosolic RNA-sensing and DNA-sensing pathways and the subsequent type-I interferon response, leading to tumour rejection and induction of immune memory. Our results demonstrate that KDM5B suppresses anti-tumour immunity by epigenetic silencing of retroelements. We therefore reveal roles of KDM5B in heterochromatin regulation and immune evasion in melanoma, opening new paths for the development of KDM5B-targeting and SETDB1-targeting therapies to enhance tumour immunogenicity and overcome immunotherapy resistance. KDM5B recruits SETDB1 to repress endogenous retroelements such as MMVL30, suppressing anti-tumour immunity, and the depletion of KDM5B induces a robust adaptive immune response and enhances the response to immune checkpoint blockade."
https://openalex.org/W3207343669,"The emergence of superconductivity with doping from correlated insulators in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has raised the intriguing possibility that its pairing mechanism is distinct from that of conventional superconductors, as described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. While there is now ample evidence for strong electronic correlations in MATBG, recent studies have claimed that unlike correlated insulators, superconductivity persists even when these interactions are partially screened. This suggests that the pairing in MATBG might be conventional in nature, a consequence of the large density of states of its nearly flat bands, perhaps phonon-mediated as in BCS superconductors. Here we combine tunneling and Andreev reflection spectroscopy with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to observe several key experimental signatures for unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. We show that the tunneling spectra below the transition temperature $T_c$ are inconsistent with that of a conventional s-wave superconductor, but rather resemble that of a nodal superconductor with an anisotropic pairing mechanism. We observe a large discrepancy between the tunneling energy gap $\Delta_T$, which far exceeds the mean-field BCS ratio (with $2\Delta_T/k_BT_c \sim 25$) and the energy gap $\Delta_{AR}$ extracted from Andreev reflection spectroscopy ($2\Delta_{AR}/k_BT_c \sim 6$). The tunneling gap persists even when superconductivity is suppressed, indicating its emergence from a pseudogap phase, with a suppressed density of states at the Fermi level. Moreover, the pseudogap state and superconductivity are both absent when MATBG is aligned with the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) underneath. These findings and other observations reported here provide a preponderance of evidence for a non-BCS mechanism for superconductivity in MATBG."
https://openalex.org/W3207537581,"Extrachromosomal circular DNA elements (eccDNAs) have been described in the literature for several decades, and are known for their broad existence across different species1,2. However, their biogenesis and functions are largely unknown. By developing a new circular DNA enrichment method, here we purified and sequenced full-length eccDNAs with Nanopore sequencing. We found that eccDNAs map across the entire genome in a close to random manner, suggesting a biogenesis mechanism of random ligation of genomic DNA fragments. Consistent with this idea, we found that apoptosis inducers can increase eccDNA generation, which is dependent on apoptotic DNA fragmentation followed by ligation by DNA ligase 3. Importantly, we demonstrated that eccDNAs can function as potent innate immunostimulants in a manner that is independent of eccDNA sequence but dependent on eccDNA circularity and the cytosolic DNA sensor Sting. Collectively, our study not only revealed the origin, biogenesis and immunostimulant function of eccDNAs but also uncovered their sensing pathway and potential clinical implications in immune response."
https://openalex.org/W3205139696,"Up to 40% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease present with psychosocial disturbances. We previously identified a gut vascular barrier that controls the dissemination of bacteria from the intestine to the liver. Here, we describe a vascular barrier in the brain choroid plexus (PVB) that is modulated in response to intestinal inflammation through bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharide. The inflammatory response induces PVB closure after gut vascular barrier opening by the up-regulation of the wingless-type, catenin-beta 1 (Wnt/β-catenin) signaling pathway, rendering it inaccessible to large molecules. In a model of genetically driven closure of choroid plexus endothelial cells, we observed a deficit in short-term memory and anxiety-like behavior, suggesting that PVB closure may correlate with mental deficits. Inflammatory bowel disease–related mental symptoms may thus be the consequence of a deregulated gut–brain vascular axis."
https://openalex.org/W3207444061,"Extreme climatic events, including marine heatwaves (MHWs), are altering ecosystems globally, often with profound socioeconomic impacts. We examine how MHWs have affected the provision of ecosystem services and evaluate the socioeconomic consequences for human society. Ecological impacts range from harmful algal blooms and mass mortality events to reconfigurations of entire ecosystems, affecting provisioning, habitat, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services globally. Reported economic costs of individual MHW events exceed US$800 million in direct losses or >US$3.1 billion in indirect losses of ecosystem services for multiple years. However, biological responses to MHWs can also increase human-ocean interactions, providing opportunities for coastal societies. Our study provides a global perspective on the far-reaching impacts of MHWs on human societies and highlights the urgent need to develop robust approaches to mitigation and adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3205847810,"Although it is generally accepted that phages drive bacterial evolution, how these dynamics play out in the wild remains poorly understood. We found that susceptibility to viral killing in marine Vibrio is mediated by large and highly diverse mobile genetic elements. These phage defense elements display exceedingly fast evolutionary turnover, resulting in differential phage susceptibility among clonal bacterial strains while phage receptors remain invariant. Protection is cumulative, and a single bacterial genome can harbor 6 to 12 defense elements, accounting for more than 90% of the flexible genome among close relatives. The rapid turnover of these elements decouples phage resistance from other genomic features. Thus, resistance to phages in the wild follows evolutionary trajectories alternative to those predicted from laboratory-based evolutionary experiments."

Many such efforts are usually associated with on-chip micro- or nanoscale structures in real space and possess a static orbital angular momentum. Recently, a new branch of singular optics has emerged that seeks phase singularities in multiple dimensions, realizing vortex beams with compact nanodevices. Here, we review the topological phase singularities in real space, momentum space, and the spatiotemporal domain for generating vortex beams; discuss recent developments in theoretical and experimental research for generation, detection, and transmission of vortex beams; and provide an outlook for future opportunities in this area, ranging from fundamental research to practical applications."

We evaluated the immune responses in nonhuman primates that received a primary vaccination series of mRNA-1273 and were boosted about 6 months later with either homologous mRNA-1273 or heterologous mRNA-1273.β, which encompasses the spike sequence of the B.1.351 Beta variant. After boost, animals had increased neutralizing antibody responses across all VOCs, which was sustained for at least 8 weeks after boost. Nine weeks after boost, animals were challenged with the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. Viral replication was low to undetectable in bronchoalveolar lavage and significantly reduced in nasal swabs in all boosted animals, suggesting that booster vaccinations may be required to sustain immunity and protection."
https://openalex.org/W3206054692,"Tissue maintenance and repair depend on the integrated activity of multiple cell types1. Whereas the contributions of epithelial2,3, immune4,5 and stromal cells6,7 in intestinal tissue integrity are well understood, the role of intrinsic neuroglia networks remains largely unknown. Here we uncover important roles of enteric glial cells (EGCs) in intestinal homeostasis, immunity and tissue repair. We demonstrate that infection of mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus leads to enteric gliosis and the upregulation of an interferon gamma (IFNγ) gene signature. IFNγ-dependent gene modules were also induced in EGCs from patients with inflammatory bowel disease8. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis of the tunica muscularis showed that glia-specific abrogation of IFNγ signalling leads to tissue-wide activation of pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs. Furthermore, disruption of the IFNγ–EGC signalling axis enhanced the inflammatory and granulomatous response of the tunica muscularis to helminths. Mechanistically, we show that the upregulation of Cxcl10 is an early immediate response of EGCs to IFNγ signalling and provide evidence that this chemokine and the downstream amplification of IFNγ signalling in the tunica muscularis are required for a measured inflammatory response to helminths and resolution of the granulomatous pathology. Our study demonstrates that IFNγ signalling in enteric glia is central to intestinal homeostasis and reveals critical roles of the IFNγ–EGC–CXCL10 axis in immune response and tissue repair after infectious challenge. Enteric glial cells have tissue-wide immunoregulatory roles through the upregulation of IFNγ-dependent genes both at steady state and after parasite infection, promoting immune homeostasis and CXCL10-mediated tissue repair after pathogen-induced intestinal damage in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3204978797,"Cells repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through a complex set of pathways critical for maintaining genomic integrity. To systematically map these pathways, we developed a high-throughput screening approach called Repair-seq that measures the effects of thousands of genetic perturbations on mutations introduced at targeted DNA lesions. Using Repair-seq, we profiled DSB repair products induced by two programmable nucleases (Cas9 and Cas12a) in the presence or absence of oligonucleotides for homology-directed repair (HDR) after knockdown of 476 genes involved in DSB repair or associated processes. The resulting data enabled principled, data-driven inference of DSB end joining and HDR pathways. Systematic interrogation of this data uncovered unexpected relationships among DSB repair genes and demonstrated that repair outcomes with superficially similar sequence architectures can have markedly different genetic dependencies. This work provides a foundation for mapping DNA repair pathways and for optimizing genome editing across diverse modalities."
https://openalex.org/W3205699459,"Over the past century, adsorption has been investigated extensively in equilibrium systems, with a focus on the van der Waals interactions associated with physisorption and electronic interactions in the case of chemisorption. In this study, we demonstrate mechanisorption, which results from nonequilibrium pumping to form mechanical bonds between the adsorbent and the adsorbate. This active mode of adsorption has been realized on surfaces of metal-organic frameworks grafted with arrays of molecular pumps. Adsorbates are transported from one well-defined compartment, the bulk, to another well-defined compartment, the interface, thereby creating large potential gradients in the form of chemical capacitors wherein energy is stored in metastable states. Mechanisorption extends, in a fundamental manner, the scope and potential of adsorption phenomena and offers a transformative approach to control chemistry at surfaces and interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W3206694195,"Mouse caspase-11 and human caspase-4 and caspase-5 recognize cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce pyroptosis by cleaving the pore-forming protein GSDMD1-5. This non-canonical inflammasome defends against Gram-negative bacteria6,7. Shigella flexneri, which causes bacillary dysentery, lives freely within the host cytosol where these caspases reside. However, the role of caspase-11-mediated pyroptosis in S. flexneri infection is unknown. Here we show that caspase-11 did not protect mice from S. flexneri infection, in contrast to infection with another cytosolic bacterium, Burkholderia thailandensis8. S. flexneri evaded pyroptosis mediated by caspase-11 or caspase 4 (hereafter referred to as caspase-11/4) using a type III secretion system (T3SS) effector, OspC3. OspC3, but not its paralogues OspC1 and 2, covalently modified caspase-11/4; although it used the NAD+ donor, this modification was not ADP-ribosylation. Biochemical dissections uncovered an ADP-riboxanation modification on Arg314 and Arg310 in caspase-4 and caspase-11, respectively. The enzymatic activity was shared by OspC1 and 2, whose ankyrin-repeat domains, unlike that of OspC3, could not recognize caspase-11/4. ADP-riboxanation of the arginine blocked autoprocessing of caspase-4/11 as well as their recognition and cleavage of GSDMD. ADP-riboxanation of caspase-11 paralysed pyroptosis-mediated defence in Shigella-infected mice and mutation of ospC3 stimulated caspase-11- and GSDMD-dependent anti-Shigella humoral immunity, generating a vaccine-like protective effect. Our study establishes ADP-riboxanation of arginine as a bacterial virulence mechanism that prevents LPS-induced pyroptosis."

Cognitive functions emerge in distributed neuronal networks through local and interareal neuronal interactions, constituting a complex interaction network. A full account of this interaction network will be fundamental for understanding brain function. Neuronal interaction networks depend on structural neuronal connectivity networks, and central insights have been obtained from anatomy. Anatomical tract tracing based on tracer injections in animals has revealed that connection strengths decrease exponentially with distance and are highly structured with characteristic motifs (Ercsey-Ravasz et al., 2013Ercsey-Ravasz M.

A given anatomical projection may or may not be used for neuronal interactions at a given moment, and it may be used for neuronal interactions of different kinds (e.g., mediating activation, suppression, modulation). While AC is typically measured in regard to monosynaptic connections, interareal neuronal interactions can extend to di- and polysynaptic interactions. While much of anatomical tract tracing, including the data used here, is focused on cortico-cortical connections, neuronal interactions may also use subcortical pathways (Guillery and Sherman, 2002Guillery R.W.

Interareal neuronal synchronization can be assessed by local field potential (LFP) coherence, and entrainment can be assessed by LFP Granger causality (GC). Both coherence and GC can be determined per frequency, resulting in coherence or GC spectra. Also, neuronal interactions can lead to correlated power fluctuations, which can be assessed by power correlation spectra. Intriguingly, neuronal rhythms in different frequency bands mediate different types of interareal interactions. We showed previously that among 8 macaque visual areas, interareal GC is stronger in the bottom-up direction for theta and gamma, and stronger in the top-down direction for beta (Bastos et al., 2015bBastos A.M.

Our previous analysis only took into account the GC asymmetry between bottom-up and top-down directions, per area pair, thereby accounting for only a very small component of the total GC variability. We related these GC asymmetries to differences in the laminar pattern between anatomical bottom-up and top-down projections, per area pair, again accounting for merely a tiny part of the total variability in anatomical projections. Anatomical projection strengths show a much larger variance, in fact, >5 orders of magnitude, across different area pairs (Markov et al., 2014aMarkov N.T. Ercsey-Ravasz M.M. Ribeiro Gomes A.R. Lamy C. Magrou L. Vezoli J. Misery P. Falchier A. Quilodran R. Gariel M.A. et al.A weighted and directed interareal connectivity matrix for macaque cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2014; 24: 17-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Here, we establish the full variability in interareal power correlation, coherence, and GC across all pairs of simultaneously recorded sites and brain areas, which we directly relate to the full variability in interareal anatomical projection strength across those area pairs. We use a unique high-resolution micro-electrocorticography (mECoG) dataset providing simultaneous LFP signals from 218 recording sites distributed across 15 areas, in 2 awake macaques. The complete 218 × 218 matrices of power correlation, coherence, and GC revealed the respective interaction networks to consist of clearly defined modules, and that the coherence and GC networks are independent of the underlying power distributions. Intriguingly, those interaction networks agree partly for some pairs of frequency bands, while differing markedly between others, as observed in human subjects (Williams et al., 2021Williams N. Wang S.H. Arnulfo G. Nobili L. Palva S. Palva J.M. Modules in connectomes of phase-synchronization comprise anatomically contiguous, functionally related regions.bioRxiv. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.24.449415Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This is remarkable given that all rhythms operate on the same anatomical backbone, suggesting that they are differentially affected by AC. To understand this better, we analyzed the mutual dependence between on the one hand, interareal power correlation, coherence, or GC, and on the other hand, the strength of the corresponding anatomical projections. Anatomical projection strength was assessed by retrograde tracer injections and quantification of labeled neurons in many cortical areas. Across area pairs, the resulting cortico-cortical projection strengths predicted power correlation less than coherence, and they were most predictive of GC. Importantly, anatomical projection strengths predicted coherence and GC much better in the gamma band than in the beta band, with intermediate values for the high-beta band. Finally, as we had previously found that beta is stronger in the top-down and gamma stronger in the bottom-up direction, we reanalyzed the correlation between anatomical projection and functional interaction strength, independently for the 2 directions. This showed that variability in beta-based interactions was more related to projections in the top-down direction, and variability in gamma-based interactions to projections in the bottom-up direction. These findings provide a fuller account of cortical interaction networks defined by brain rhythms and reveal a previously unsuspected richer landscape. We investigated neuronal activity in large-scale brain networks in 2 macaque monkeys performing a selective visual attention task (Figure 1A; see Method details). We focused on the task period with sustained visual stimulation and attention. Attention conditions were pooled to increase sensitivity, except where explicitly noted. Chronically implanted subdural mECoG grids with 252 electrodes allowed simultaneous recording from 218 local bipolar derivations, referred to as (recording) sites, distributed over large parts of the left hemisphere (Figure 1B for the combined sites of both monkeys, Figure S1A for the sites per monkey), and covering 15 cortical areas. We computed the following frequency-resolved FC metrics between all possible site pairs: (1) coherence, a metric of interareal synchronization; (2) power correlation, the Spearman rank correlation between fluctuations in band-limited power; and (3) GC, a metric of directed interareal influence (see Method details). Coherence and power correlation are undirected metrics, whereas GC is a directed metric that allows the calculation of influences in both directions. For analyses at the level of site pairs, we used all possible site combinations—per monkey ≈23,000 coherence or power-correlation spectra, and ≈46,000 GC spectra (after exclusion of site pairs with spectra indicative of artifactual coupling, which amounted to 1.7% of all site pairs in monkey 1 and 1.1% in monkey 2; see Method details). The 15 simultaneously recorded cortical areas allowed for the analysis of FC for 105 area pairs. Each area was recorded from several sites (see Method details), such that each interareal interaction was assessed by several interareal site pairs. The spectra of site pairs belonging to a given area pair were averaged for all of the analyses at the level of area pairs. Figure 1B shows example coherence and GC spectra for several pairs of cortical areas. These spectra show distinct peaks, which are specific for the respective pair of brain areas. Across all 105 area pairs, average FC spectra showed peaks for 4 characteristic brain rhythms, with some individual differences across the 2 monkeys (Figure 1C for coherence, Figure S1B for power correlation and GC): The theta rhythm (3 ± 2 Hz in monkey 1 and 4 ± 3 Hz in monkey 2; peak ± full width at half-maximum [FWHM]), the beta rhythm (18 ± 5 Hz in monkey 1 and 15 ± 5 Hz in monkey 2), the high-beta rhythm (34 ± 5 Hz in monkey 1 and 32 ± 4 Hz in monkey 2), and the gamma rhythm (75 ± 8 Hz in monkey 1 and 62 ± 8 Hz in monkey 2) (Figures 1B, 1C, and S1B). All further analyses focus on these 4 rhythms. For analyses at the 4 corresponding frequency bands, FC values were averaged over the frequency bins in the monkey-specific frequency bands and subsequently averaged over monkeys. For analyses of full spectra, the FC spectra were aligned to the 4 monkey-specific peak frequencies (PFs) and subsequently averaged over monkeys. For each band, we calculated all FC metrics for all pairs of recording sites. The resulting FC matrices for monkey 1 are shown in Figures 2A and 2C; The same analysis for monkey 2 is shown in Figures S2A and S2C; The individual matrices cannot be directly averaged over animals because the numbers of recording sites per area differ between monkeys (see Method details). The 4 frequency bands showed distinct interaction networks. We defined distinctiveness D = 1-R2, with R2 being the coefficient of determination (squared Pearson correlation coefficient) across all site pairs, between matrices of one FC type (concatenated over the 2 animals), separately for all combinations of frequency bands (Figure 2E). As an example, GC networks were least distinct between beta and high-beta, with D = 0.29, and most distinct between beta and gamma, with D = 0.75. As it is known that FC metrics in different frequency bands tend to jointly decrease with distance (Leopold et al., 2003Leopold D.A. Murayama Y. Logothetis N.K. Very slow activity fluctuations in monkey visual cortex: implications for functional brain imaging.Cereb. Cortex. 2003; 13: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar; Nelson and Pouget, 2012Nelson M.J. Pouget P. Physical model of coherent potentials measured with different electrode recording site sizes.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we partialized the calculation of R2 for distance, which increased all D values. Hence for GC networks, D between beta and high-beta increased to 0.74, and D between beta and gamma increased to 1. Note that D was overall much lower for power correlation than for coherence or GC. The almost complete distinctiveness, after distance partialization, between FC networks for some frequency-band combinations is remarkable, given that all networks emerge on the same AC network. If the shared AC network does not account for the distinct interaction networks, then these interaction networks may be accounted for by different distributions of power across recording sites for the different frequency bands. We calculated the same distinctiveness metric between FC and the co-occurrence of power, concretely, for example, between the gamma-GC matrix and the matrix of the products of average gamma power values of the corresponding site pairs (specifically log10(powersite1×powersite2)), again either with or without partializing for cortical distance (Figure 2F). Staying with the example of the gamma GC network, distinctiveness was 1, both with and without partialization for distance. We considered that GC may be particularly related to power in the sending-area sites, and therefore also calculated D between, for example, the gamma-GC matrix and the matrix of average gamma power values of the corresponding sending-area sites (specifically log10(power); Figure 2G). This left D values essentially unchanged at 1 (with and without partialization). Thus, band-specific FC networks, as assessed, for example, by gamma and beta GC, are highly distinct and contain structure beyond power distributions. Note that the D values were overall much lower for power correlation than for coherence or GC. Note that the GC matrices (Figure 2C) list both the sending areas (on the y axis) and the receiving areas (on the x axis) according to their hierarchical level. In this manner, differences between GC in the bottom-up versus top-down direction described previously (Bastos et al., 2015bBastos A.M. Vezoli J. Bosman C.A. Schoffelen J.M. Oostenveld R. Dowdall J.R. De Weerd P. Kennedy H. Fries P. Visual areas exert feedforward and feedback influences through distinct frequency channels.Neuron. 2015; 85: 390-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) can be appreciated by appropriately comparing the upper and lower triangular GC matrices (for the 8 visual areas investigated in Bastos et al., 2015bBastos A.M. Vezoli J. Bosman C.A. Schoffelen J.M. Oostenveld R. Dowdall J.R. De Weerd P. Kennedy H. Fries P. Visual areas exert feedforward and feedback influences through distinct frequency channels.Neuron. 2015; 85: 390-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar], i.e., V1, V2, 8L, V4, TEO, DP, 8M, 7A). This illustrates that these bottom-up versus top-down differences account for only a small fraction of the full GC variability that we investigate here. Visual inspection of the FC matrices suggested that band-specific interaction networks may form distinct modules. We therefore performed a modularity analysis that rearranges connectivity matrices so that highly connected sites (“nodes”) are contained in the same module (see Method details; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010Rubinov M. Sporns O. Complex network measures of brain connectivity: uses and interpretations.Neuroimage. 2010; 52: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (6411) Google Scholar). The resulting partitioning is referred to as community structure. To obtain 1 consensus community structure over the 4 frequency bands, we combined (for example) the GC matrices for the 4 bands in the same way as previous studies combined connectivity matrices over participants. For the example of GC in monkey 1 (Figure 2D), this revealed that module 1 was dominated by gamma, module 2 by high-beta, and module 3 by beta, with relatively strong links between modules 2 and 3, and weak links between both of these modules and module 1. The modularity analysis for monkey 2 is shown in Figure S2 and shows an overall similar pattern for GC. To characterize overall modularity, we calculated the modularity index. Networks with high modularity index show strong intramodule and weak intermodule connectivity. Modularity indices are reported in Figures 2 and S2, on the margins of the corresponding (triangular) matrices. Modularity indices were much lower for power correlation than for coherence or GC. To investigate whether band-specific FC networks have meaningful brain-topographical patterns, we calculated, for each site pair, a metric that is referred to as “strength.” Coherence strength of a recording site is the average coherence of that site with all other sites (excluding sites within a 2-mm radius to avoid residual volume conduction effects). Power correlation strength is defined accordingly. For GC, we defined the GC-outflow strength of a site as the average GC of that site to all other sites, and GC-inflow strength as the average GC to that site from all other sites. Averaging collapses the FC matrices onto their margins, and allows visualization of topographical distributions as strength maps (Figure 3, averaged over monkeys; see Method details). Strength maps, for most combinations of FC type and frequency band, showed contiguous clusters with the tendency to respect sulcal anatomy, and thereby most strength maps showed clear and meaningful topographies. We also demonstrate that weak long-distance FC deviates significantly from randomized intersite FC (Figure S3A; see Method details). Significant interareal FC covers long distances (>20 mm) for all frequencies; FC at gamma extends up to 50 mm and FC at beta, theta, and high-beta beyond 60 mm. We next investigated whether these FC patterns could be partly explained by known patterns of AC. We previously showed that GC asymmetries are related to the feedforward/feedback character of the respective anatomical projections (Bastos et al., 2015bBastos A.M. Vezoli J. Bosman C.A. Schoffelen J.M. Oostenveld R. Dowdall J.R. De Weerd P. Kennedy H. Fries P. Visual areas exert feedforward and feedback influences through distinct frequency channels.Neuron. 2015; 85: 390-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), as quantified by the supragranular labeled neuron (SLN) percentage value (Barone et al., 2000Barone P. Batardiere A. Knoblauch K. Kennedy H.

Ullman S. et al.Anatomy of hierarchy: feedforward and feedback pathways in macaque visual cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 2014; 522: 225-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In the present study, we address another fundamental aspect of an anatomical projection, namely its strength, which is captured by the fraction of labeled neurons (FLN) (Vezoli et al., 2004Vezoli J. Falchier A. Jouve B. Knoblauch K. Young M. Kennedy H. Quantitative analysis of connectivity in the visual cortex: extracting function from structure.Neuroscientist. 2004; 10: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After injection of a retrograde tracer into area A, retrogradely labeled neurons are counted across the brain (e.g., in area B). The FLN of the projection from B to A is the number of labeled neurons found in B divided by the total number of neurons found across the brain. In this way, FLN reflects the fraction of neurons projecting to A that originates in B. While the majority of projections to a given cortical area arises from within the area itself (∼80%), we are concerned here with projections arising from other areas and so estimate the extrinsic fraction of labeled neurons (FLNe) (Markov et al., 2011Markov N.T. Misery P. Falchier A. Lamy C. Vezoli J. Quilodran R. Gariel M.A. Giroud P. Ercsey-Ravasz M. Pilaz L.J. et al.Weight consistency specifies regularities of macaque cortical networks.Cereb. Cortex. 2011; 21: 1254-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We were interested in how interareal FC, assessed by coherence, power correlation, and GC, relates to interareal AC, assessed by FLNe. We used a dataset based on 28 retrograde tracer injections across 14 cortical areas (Figure 4A). These 14 areas were identical to the 15 areas recorded electrophysiologically, except that they did not include the temporo-parietal area (TPt). The 14 areas resulted in a 14 × 14 matrix of 182 FLNe values (Figure 4C). Note that this is a directed matrix of AC, in which FLNe from area A to area B is quantified independently of the FLNe in the reverse direction. Thus, the following analyses relate the full FLNe matrix (Figure 4C) to the corresponding part of the full GC matrix. By contrast, the matrices of coherence and power correlation assess overall FC irrespective of direction. To relate them to AC strength, we averaged FLNe over the 2 directions, giving a triangular matrix with 91 entries (Figure 4B). Spectra were averaged over all site pairs of a given area pair (Figures S3C and S3D) and subsequently over the 2 animals (Figure S4). Hence, we determined the PFs per monkey and per rhythm (theta, beta, high-beta, gamma), and expressed frequencies relative to the per-monkey PFs. This suggested that overall, coherence and GC increased with increasing FLNe (Figure S4A). For this analysis, we excluded FLNe values based on <10 labeled neurons (Figure S4A) to ensure the reliability of FLNe estimation (Markov et al., 2014aMarkov N.T. Ercsey-Ravasz M.M. Ribeiro Gomes A.R. Lamy C. Magrou L. Vezoli J. Misery P. Falchier A. Quilodran R. Gariel M.A. et al.A weighted and directed interareal connectivity matrix for macaque cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2014; 24: 17-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The pattern held, when we included those FLNe values (Figure S4B), or when we replaced them by estimates from a model fitted to neuron counts from the non-zero FLNe values (Figure S4C; see Method details). To quantify the observed patterns, we performed linear regression analysis between log10(FC) and log10(FLNe) separately for all combinations of FC type (coherence, power correlation and GC) and frequency band (theta, beta, high-beta, gamma) (Figure 5). For each combination, there was a significantly positive correlation (p < 4.17E−3 after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons), but with a wide range of correlation strengths (Figure 5A). FLNe was least predictive for FC at beta, with explained variance (R2 values) for beta power correlation or beta GC of 0.14. FLNe was most predictive of theta (R2 = 0.47) and high-beta coherence (R2 = 0.39) and gamma GC (R2 = 0.42). To capture the size of the FLNe effect on FC, we used a regression analysis (Figure 5B). We performed a simple linear regression with the dependent variable log10(FC) and the independent variable log10(FLNe). We then used the linear fit to calculate the expected FC at the minimal FLNe value, in other words, FC(min(FLNe)), and at the maximal FLNe value, in other words, FC(max(FLNe)). The ratio FC(max(FLNe)) / FC(min(FLNe)) was used as the FLNe-related FC change (Figures 5B and 5C). This metric is related to the regression slope, but normalizes for differences in FC across frequencies that are not due to FLNe. We derived error estimates by 100 bootstrap replications over trials (Figures 5B and 5C) (Efron and Tibshirani, 1994Efron B. Tibshirani R.J. An Introduction to the Bootstrap. CRC Press, 1994Crossref Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that the 3 types of FC showed different degrees of dependency with FLNe. The power correlation was the least FLNe dependent, coherence was intermediate, and GC was by far the most strongly FLNe dependent. The spectrum for power correlation did not show any clear peaks (even when scaled independently). The spectrum for coherence showed peaks for high-beta and gamma, and a local trough for beta, while that for GC showed a small peak in the theta range and substantial peaks for high-beta and gamma, and again a local trough for beta. These results suggest that the dependence of coherence and GC on AC has a characteristic spectral pattern. At the individual PFs for gamma and high-beta (and partly also for theta), this dependence is stronger than at neighboring frequencies; by contrast, at the individual PFs for beta, this dependence is weaker than at neighboring frequencies. FC is both stimulation and task dependent, which is likely to dynamically influence its dependence on AC. Therefore, we obtained this spectrum for GC separately for the pre-stimulus baseline period, and for the 2 attention conditions during the post-cue period (Figure S5A). During the baseline, the spectrum showed muc"

Notably, the anterior insula was associated with both breathing-related prediction certainty and prediction errors, suggesting an important role in representing and updating models of the body. Individuals with low versus moderate anxiety traits showed differential anterior insula activity for prediction certainty.

These differences are thought to reflect song practice and performance, respectively2,3, providing a useful system in which to explore how neurons encode and regulate motor variability in these two states. Here we show that calcium signals in ensembles of spiny neurons (SNs) in the basal ganglia are highly variable relative to their cortical afferents during song practice. By contrast, SN calcium signals are strongly suppressed during female-directed performance, and optogenetically suppressing SNs during practice strongly reduces vocal variability. Unsupervised learning methods4,5 show that specific SN activity patterns map onto distinct song practice variants. Finally, we establish that noradrenergic signalling reduces vocal variability by directly suppressing SN activity. Thus, SN ensembles encode and drive vocal exploration during practice, and the noradrenergic suppression of SN activity promotes stereotyped and precise song performance for an audience."

For example, mouse Parkin coregulated gene (PACRG) recruits meiosis-expressed gene 1 (MEIG1) to the manchette during normal spermiogenesis. Here we mutated Y68 of MEIG1 using the CRISPR/cas9 system and examined the biological and physiological consequences in mice. All homozygous mutant males examined were completely infertile, and sperm count was dramatically reduced. The few developed sperm were immotile and displayed multiple abnormalities. Histological staining showed impaired spermiogenesis in these mutant mice. Immunofluorescent staining further revealed that this mutant MEIG1 was still present in the cell body of spermatocytes, but also that more MEIG1 accumulated in the acrosome region of round spermatids. The mutant MEIG1 and a cargo protein of the MEIG1/PACRG complex, sperm-associated antigen 16L (SPAG16L), were no longer found to be present in the manchette; however, localization of the PACRG component was not changed in the mutants. These findings demonstrate that Y68 of MEIG1 is a key amino acid required for PACRG to recruit MEIG1 to the manchette to transport cargo proteins during sperm flagella formation. Given that MEIG1 and PACRG are conserved in humans, small molecules that block MEIG1/PACRG interaction are likely ideal targets for the development of male contraconception drugs.

Mouse Meig1 was originally cloned in a screen for genes essential for meiosis (1Don J. Wolgemuth D.J.

Even though Meig1 is expressed in multiple tissues, it is most abundantly expressed in tissues rich in ciliated cells. Therefore, it is predicted to be important for cilia formation. In mouse testis, Meig1 message is present in germ cells and Sertoli cells (4Don J. Winer M.A. Wolgemuth D.J.

Our laboratory further discovered that MEIG1’s primary function is in germ cells, not in Sertoli cells (9Teves M.E. Jha K.N. Song J. Nagarkatti-Gude D.R. Herr J.C. Foster J.A. Strauss J.F. Zhang Z. Germ cell-specific disruption of the Meig1 gene causes impaired spermiogenesis in mice.Andrology. 2013; 1: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The mechanism of MEIG1’s function was further studied in our laboratory. MEIG1 is present in cell bodies of spermatocytes and round spermatids, but it is translocated to the manchette in elongating spermatids (10Li W. Tang W. Teves M.E. Zhang Z. Zhang L. Li H. Archer K.J.

A MEIG1/PACRG complex in the manchette is essential for building the sperm flagella.Development. 2015; 142: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The manchette is a transient structure only present in elongating spermatids. The timing of manchette development is very precise (11Clermont Y.O.R. Louis Harkey H. Clermont Y. Hermo L.

Two major functions of the manchette have been proposed: shaping spermatid heads and sorting structural proteins to the centrosome and the developing sperm tail through intra-manchette transport (IMT) (13Kierszenbaum A.L.

These proposed functions are supported by the characteristics of its structural proteins and mutant mouse models. The manchette contains molecular motor proteins and proteins used to build sperm tails (15Kierszenbaum A.L. Rivkin E. Tres L.L.

SPAG16L is localized in the manchette of elongating spermatids of wild-type mice. However, it is absent in the manchette of the remaining elongating spermatids of MEIG1 or PACRG-deficient mice (10Li W. Tang W. Teves M.E. Zhang Z. Zhang L. Li H. Archer K.J. Peterson D.L.

Thus, MEIG1 and PACRG appear to form a complex in the manchette to transport cargo (SPAG16L) to build sperm flagellum. MEIG1’s structure was resolved by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (47Li W. Walavalkar N.M. Buchwald W.A. Teves M.E. Zhang L. Liu H. Bilinovich S. Peterson D.L. Strauss J.F. Williams D.C. Zhang Z. Dissecting the structural basis of MEIG1 interaction with PACRG.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 18278Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The shape of MEIG1 resembles a dumbbell, such that associated proteins can bind to either of two opposing concave surfaces or the two convex ends of the dumbbell. Twelve amino acids exposed on the protein surface are believed to mediate interactions between MEIG1 and its binding partners, particularly PACRG (47Li W. Walavalkar N.M. Buchwald W.A. Teves M.E. Zhang L. Liu H. Bilinovich S. Peterson D.L. Strauss J.F. Williams D.C. Zhang Z. Dissecting the structural basis of MEIG1 interaction with PACRG.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 18278Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We examined the role of the 12 amino acids in MEIG1/PACRG interaction and discovered that the four amino acids located on the same surface, W50, K57, F66, and particularly Y68, mediate interaction between MEIG1 and PACRG (47Li W. Walavalkar N.M. Buchwald W.A. Teves M.E. Zhang L. Liu H. Bilinovich S. Peterson D.L. Strauss J.F. Williams D.C. Zhang Z. Dissecting the structural basis of MEIG1 interaction with PACRG.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 18278Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We mutated the Y68 amino acid using the CRISPR/cas9 system to study its role in vivo. The single amino acid mutant MEIG1 was still present in the cell bodies of spermatocytes and round spermatids, but was no longer present in the manchette of the remaining elongating spermatids. The MEIG1 mutation caused male mice infertility associated with dramatically reduced sperm counts and abnormal sperm morphology, including short tails, vesicles in the flagella, and different thicknesses along the tails. Most importantly, sperm were immotile. SPAG16L was not present in the manchette in elongating spermatids of the mutant mice. The phenotype was similar to the global Meig1 knockout mice. The study demonstrates that Y68 is a key amino acid for PACRG to recruit MEIG1 to the manchette to form the MEIG1/PACRG complex, which is essential for transporting cargo proteins for sperm formation. We previously discovered that four amino acids, W50, K57, F66, and particularly Y68, mediate interactions between MEIG1 and PACRG in vitro (47Li W. Walavalkar N.M. Buchwald W.A. Teves M.E. Zhang L. Liu H. Bilinovich S. Peterson D.L. Strauss J.F. Williams D.C. Zhang Z. Dissecting the structural basis of MEIG1 interaction with PACRG.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 18278Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To test if these amino acids, particularly Y68, are important for MEIG1’s function in vivo, we generated a mouse model replacing Y68 with alanine using the CRISPR/cas9 system (Fig. S1A). DNA sequencing of the RT-PCR product revealed that only Y68 amino acid was mutated to A68 in the model (Fig. S1B). Western blot analysis using testicular extracts demonstrated that the mutant MEIG1 protein was expressed in the testis (Fig. 1A). Localization of the mutant MEIG1 was examined by immunofluorescence staining. As reported previously (10Li W. Tang W. Teves M.E. Zhang Z. Zhang L. Li H. Archer K.J. Peterson D.L. Williams D.C. Strauss J.F. A MEIG1/PACRG complex in the manchette is essential for building the sperm flagella.Development. 2015; 142: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the wild-type MEIG1 was present in cell bodies of spermatocytes and round spermatids, and it was translocated to the manchette of elongating spermatids (Fig. 1Ba–c). The Y68A mutant MEIG1 was still present in cell bodies of spermatocytes and round spermatids. However, it was no longer present in the manchette. Interestingly, the mutant MEIG1 appeared to accumulate in the acrosome as an increased MEIG1 signal was observed here (Fig. 1Bd–f). Homozygous mutant mice did not show any gross abnormalities. To test fertility of these mutant mice, 2 to 3 month-old wild-type mice and homozygous mutant mice were bred with 2 to 3-month-old wild-type mice for more than 2 months. All the control mice, including wild-type and heterozygous males and homozygous mutant females, showed normal fertility. All homozygous mutant males examined were infertile (Fig. 2A). There was no significant difference in testis/body weight between the control and homozygous mutant mice (Fig. 2B). Sperm number, morphology, and motility from the control and homozygous mutant mice were examined (Fig. 2, C–F). The sperm count was dramatically reduced in the mutant mice (Fig. 2, C and D and Movie S1). Sperm from the control mice showed normal morphology (Fig. 2C and Movie S2, left panel). Multiple abnormalities in sperm were observed in the mutant mice, including short tails, vesicles in the flagella, and different thicknesses along the tails (Fig. 2C and Movie S1, right panel), and percentage of abnormal sperm was significantly increased in the mutant mice (Fig. 2E and Movie S1). More than 70% of sperm from the control group were motile and showed progressive motility (Fig. 2F and Movie S2); No sperm were motile in the mutant mice (Fig. 2F and Movie S1). Significantly reduced and nonfunctional sperm suggests impaired spermatogenesis in the mutant mice. To examine the spermatogenesis process in the mutant mice, testes from 4 to 5 month-old control and homozygous mutant mice were collected for HE staining. The control mice showed a normal spermatogenesis process. However, the mutant mice showed impaired spermiogenesis. Elongating spermatids lacking tails or with short tails and deformed heads were frequently observed in the seminiferous tubules of the mutant mice (Fig. 3A). Histology of cauda epididymis of the adult control and the mutant mice was also examined. The control mice had highly concentrated normal sperm in the lumen (Fig. 3Ba). However, the mutant mice had low sperm concentration with multiple abnormalities, as observed in the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 3Bb). To investigate the structural basis for the reduced sperm number and sperm morphology changes, TEM was conducted in testis. In seminiferous tubules of the controls, normal spermiogenesis process was observed, including chromatin condensation, flagella formation, and numbers of elongated spermatids released to the lumen (Fig. 4a). However, in the MEIG1Y68A mutant mice, there were few sperm in the seminiferous tubules, and these developed sperm had abnormal flagellar structure, chromatin condensation, and sperm head shapes. The flagella with abnormal ‘‘9 + 2’’ axoneme arrangement were surrounded by many lysosomes, which seemed to degrade the abnormal sperm. They were also concentrated in Sertoli cells, with evidence of Sertoli cell phagocytosis. What’s more, consistent with the phenotype of MEIG1-deficient mice, flagellar components such as microtubules and outer dense fibers could be detected but were not assembled correctly (Fig. 4, b–h). Testicular PACRG level and its localization in elongating spermatids were examined in the MEIG1Y68A mutant mice. There was no difference in PACRG levels between the control and MEIG1 mutant mice (Fig. 5A). However, co-IP experiment showed that PACRG does not bind with the Y68A mutant MEIG1 (Fig. 5B). We previously discovered that mouse PACRG was present in the manchette of elongating spermatids of wild-type and global Meig1 knockout mice (10Li W. Tang W. Teves M.E. Zhang Z. Zhang L. Li H. Archer K.J. Peterson D.L. Williams D.C. Strauss J.F. A MEIG1/PACRG complex in the manchette is essential for building the sperm flagella.Development. 2015; 142: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the MEIG1Y68A mutant mice, like in the control mice (Fig. 5C, top panels), PACRG was still present in the manchette (Fig. 5C, bottom two panels), even though the mutant MEIG1 was not present in the manchette anymore (Fig. 1Bf), supporting our previous conclusion that PACRG is an “upstream protein” of MEIG1. SPAG16L is present in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes and round spermatids and is recruited to the manchette by MEIG1/PACRG complex (10Li W. Tang W. Teves M.E. Zhang Z. Zhang L. Li H. Archer K.J. Peterson D.L. Williams D.C. Strauss J.F. A MEIG1/PACRG complex in the manchette is essential for building the sperm flagella.Development. 2015; 142: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We therefore examined testicular SPAG16L expression levels and localization in the MEIG1Y68A mutant mice. The testicular SPAG16L expression level was not changed as revealed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6A). In spermatocytes and round spermatids, SPAG16L was still localized in the cytoplasm of the mutant mice, which is consistent with the localization as seen in the control mice (Fig. 6Ba–d). However, SPAG16L was no longer present in the manchette in elongating spermatids of the mutant mice (Fig. 6Bd). The results further support our conclusion that the manchette localization of SPAG16L is dependent on MEIG1 (10Li W. Tang W. Teves M.E. Zhang Z. Zhang L. Li H. Archer K.J. Peterson D.L. Williams D.C. Strauss J.F. A MEIG1/PACRG complex in the manchette is essential for building the sperm flagella.Development. 2015; 142: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our lab previously resolved MEIG1’s structure by NMR. Twelve amino acids exposed on the protein surface are believed to mediate interactions between MEIG1 and its binding partners (47Li W. Walavalkar N.M. Buchwald W.A. Teves M.E. Zhang L. Liu H. Bilinovich S. Peterson D.L. Strauss J.F. Williams D.C. Zhang Z. Dissecting the structural basis of MEIG1 interaction with PACRG.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 18278Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We further examined the role of the 12 amino acids on MEIG1’s surface in MEIG1/PACRG interaction and discovered that the four amino acids located on the same surface, W50, K57, F66, and especially Y68, are involved in interaction with PACRG (47Li W.

https://openalex.org/W3205136588,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an essential glycolipid that covers the surface of gram-negative bacteria. The transport of LPS involves a dedicated seven-protein transporter system called the lipopolysaccharide transport system (Lpt) machinery that physically spans the entire cell envelope. The LptB2FG complex is an ABC transporter that hydrolyzes ATP to extract LPS from the inner membrane for transport to the outer membrane. Here, we extracted LptB2FG directly from the inner membrane with its original lipid environment using styrene-maleic acid polymers. We found that styrene-maleic acid polymers-LptB2FG in nanodiscs display not only ATPase activity but also a previously uncharacterized adenylate kinase (AK) activity, as it catalyzed phosphotransfer between two ADP molecules to generate ATP and AMP. The ATPase and AK activities of LptB2FG were both stimulated by the interaction on the periplasmic side with the periplasmic LPS transport proteins LptC and LptA and inhibited by the presence of the LptC transmembrane helix. We determined that the isolated ATPase module (LptB) had weak AK activity in the absence of transmembrane proteins LptF and LptG, and one mutation in LptB that weakens its affinity for ADP led to AK activity similar to that of fully assembled complex. Thus, we conclude that LptB2FG is capable of producing ATP from ADP, depending on the assembly of the Lpt bridge, and that this AK activity might be important to ensure efficient LPS transport in the fully assembled Lpt system."
https://openalex.org/W3210865785,"Models of terrestrial planet formation predict that the final stages of planetary assembly-lasting tens of millions of years beyond the dispersal of young protoplanetary disks-are dominated by planetary collisions. It is through these giant impacts that planets like the young Earth grow to their final mass and achieve long-term stable orbital configurations1. A key prediction is that these impacts produce debris. So far, the most compelling observational evidence for post-impact debris comes from the planetary system around the nearby 23-million-year-old A-type star HD 172555. This system shows large amounts of fine dust with an unusually steep size distribution and atypical dust composition, previously attributed to either a hypervelocity impact2,3 or a massive asteroid belt4. Here we report the spectrally resolved detection of a carbon monoxide gas ring co-orbiting with dusty debris around HD 172555 between about six and nine astronomical units-a region analogous to the outer terrestrial planet region of our Solar System. Taken together, the dust and carbon monoxide detections favour a giant impact between large, volatile-rich bodies. This suggests that planetary-scale collisions, analogous to the Moon-forming impact, can release large amounts of gas as well as debris, and that this gas is observable, providing a window into the composition of young planets."
