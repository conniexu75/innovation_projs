https://openalex.org/W2006304022,"Large-crystal perovskite films The performance of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite planar solar cells has steadily improved. One outstanding issue is that grain boundaries and defects in polycrystalline films degrade their output. Now, two studies report the growth of millimeter-scale single crystals. Nie et al. grew continuous, pinhole-free, thin iodochloride films with a hot-casting technique and report device efficiencies of 18%. Shi et al. used antisolvent vapor-assisted crystallization to grow millimeter-scale bromide and iodide cubic crystals with charge-carrier diffusion lengths exceeding 10 mm.

https://openalex.org/W2143338675,"State-of-the-art photovoltaics use high-purity, large-area, wafer-scale single-crystalline semiconductors grown by sophisticated, high-temperature crystal growth processes. We demonstrate a solution-based hot-casting technique to grow continuous, pinhole-free thin films of organometallic perovskites with millimeter-scale crystalline grains. We fabricated planar solar cells with efficiencies approaching 18%, with little cell-to-cell variability. The devices show hysteresis-free photovoltaic response, which had been a fundamental bottleneck for the stable operation of perovskite devices. Characterization and modeling attribute the improved performance to reduced bulk defects and improved charge carrier mobility in large-grain devices. We anticipate that this technique will lead the field toward synthesis of wafer-scale crystalline perovskites, necessary for the fabrication of high-efficiency solar cells, and will be applicable to several other material systems plagued by polydispersity, defects, and grain boundary recombination in solution-processed thin films."

Metadata, however, contain sensitive information. Understanding the privacy of these data sets is key to their broad use and, ultimately, their impact. We study 3 months of credit card records for 1.1 million people and show that four spatiotemporal points are enough to uniquely reidentify 90% of individuals. We show that knowing the price of a transaction increases the risk of reidentification by 22%, on average. Finally, we show that even data sets that provide coarse information at any or all of the dimensions provide little anonymity and that women are more reidentifiable than men in credit card metadata."
https://openalex.org/W2048118807,"Many enzymes oxidize unactivated aliphatic C-H bonds selectively to form alcohols; however, biological systems do not possess enzymes that catalyse the analogous aminations of C-H bonds. The absence of such enzymes limits the discovery of potential medicinal candidates because nitrogen-containing groups are crucial to the biological activity of therapeutic agents and clinically useful natural products. In one prominent example illustrating the importance of incorporating nitrogen-based functionality, the conversion of the ketone of erythromycin to the -N(Me)CH2- group in azithromycin leads to a compound that can be dosed once daily with a shorter treatment time. For such reasons, synthetic chemists have sought catalysts that directly convert C-H bonds to C-N bonds. Most currently used catalysts for C-H bond amination are ill suited to the intermolecular functionalization of complex molecules because they require excess substrate or directing groups, harsh reaction conditions, weak or acidic C-H bonds, or reagents containing specialized groups on the nitrogen atom. Among C-H bond amination reactions, those forming a C-N bond at a tertiary alkyl group would be particularly valuable, because this linkage is difficult to form from ketones or alcohols that might be created in a biosynthetic pathway by oxidation. Here we report a mild, selective, iron-catalysed azidation of tertiary C-H bonds that occurs without excess of the valuable substrate. The reaction tolerates aqueous environments and is suitable for the functionalization of complex structures in the late stages of a multistep synthesis. Moreover, this azidation makes it possible to install a range of nitrogen-based functional groups, including those from Huisgen 'click' cycloadditions and the Staudinger ligation. We anticipate that these reactions will create opportunities to modify natural products, their precursors and their derivatives to produce analogues that contain different polarity and charge as a result of nitrogen-containing groups. It could also be used to help identify targets of biologically active molecules by creating a point of attachment--for example, to fluorescent tags or 'handles' for affinity chromatography--directly on complex molecular structures."

Some have argued that this is due to culture rather than being innate. Rugani et al. , however, show that 3-day-old chicks share this representation of numbers, consistently seeking lower numbers to the left of a target and larger numbers to the right (see the Perspective by Brugger). These results suggest that there may be an innate spatial representation of numerical values that we share with other animals. Science , this issue p. 534 ; see also p. 477"
https://openalex.org/W2113216285,"Switching transcription and replication Because mitochondrial DNA is circular, the transcription and replication machinery might be expected to collide. A single mitochondrial RNA polymerase (mtRNAP) transcribes the mitochondrial DNA and also generates primers for replication. Agaronyan et al. now show that transcription and replication are kept separate in human mitochondria, with the mitochondrial transcription elongation factor TEFM serving as a key player in the switch. In the absence of TEFM, mtRNAP terminates downstream from the promoter, forming primers to promote replication. In the presence of TEFM, the primers are not formed, and the overall processivity of mtRNAP elongation complexes is enhanced, promoting genome transcription. These mutually exclusive mechanisms allow the processes to proceed independently as needed by the cell. Science , this issue p. 548"

PI3Kδ is a class I PI3K that is formed by a catalytic subunit (p110δ) and a regulatory subunit (p85).

In the European Union, Zydelig is indicated, in combination with rituximab, for the treatment of patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia and refractory follicular B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and as first line therapy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation who are unsuitable for chemoimmunotherapy (19.EMA Zydelig: summary of opinion (initial authorization). European Medicines Agency, London, UK2014Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the results of a set of biochemical and biophysical experiments aimed at defining how idelalisib inhibits PI3Kδ. The human p110α and murine p110δ catalytic subunits were co-expressed with the p85α regulatory subunit and purified as heterodimers. Human p110γ was expressed and purified without a regulatory subunit. PI3Kβ was purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA) (item 14-603, lot 1994929-B). Polyhistidine tags engineered at the N termini of the p110 constructs were used to purify the protein. The p110 domains and p85α were cloned into pFastBacHTa and pFastBac dual vectors, respectively. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21) cells at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml were infected with an optimized ratio of viruses for 70 h at 27 °C. 20 g of cell pellets were processed for each of these samples, and the protein was purified using a Ni-NTA FF column (GE Life Sciences) and was buffer-exchanged using a KW2003 SEC column (Showa Denko America, New York, NY). The final sample of p110α-p85α was delivered in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. P110δ-p85α was delivered in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 40% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, and 3 mm CHAPS. P110γ was delivered in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. A second p110δ construct was prepared with an rTEV-digestible site inserted after the adaptor-binding domain (ABD) and co-expressed with the iSH2 domain of p85α. The cloning, expression, and purification strategies for this construct were adapted from a published protocol (20.Berndt A. Miller S. Williams O. Le D.D. Houseman B.T. Pacold J.I. Gorrec F. Hon W.C. Liu Y. Rommel C. Gaillard P. Rückle T. Schwarz M.K. Shokat K.M. Shaw J.P. Williams R.L. The p110 δ structure: mechanisms for selectivity and potency of new PI(3)K inhibitors.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The addition of 3 mm CHAPS to the lysis buffer helped maximize the recovery of the p110δ/iSH2-p85α complex from the cell pellet. Cell lysate after clarification was loaded on a Ni-NTA FF column and extensively washed with lysis buffer (20 CV) containing 1 m NaCl to remove contaminant proteins. The pure heterodimer was eluted from the column and digested with the rTEV protease to remove the iSH2 and ABD domains. The resulting protein was passed through a Ni-NTA FF column, and the flow-through portion containing ΔABD-p110δ protein was pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a size exclusion chromatography column (KW2003) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 50 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 1% (w/v) betaine, 300 mm CHAPS, and 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP). Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled and concentrated to 20 mg/ml for crystallization trials. The final sample had 15% polydispersity as measured by dynamic light scattering (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA), and the purity was 98% as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. We measured IC50 values for all four class I PI3Ks. The full-length protein used for the PI3Kα, γ, and δ measurements is described above. The PI3Kβ consisted of a complex of N-terminal His6-tagged recombinant full-length human p110β and untagged, full-length, human p85α (Millipore). The enzymatic activity of the class I PI3K isoforms was measured using a time-resolved FRET assay that monitors formation of the product PIP3, because it competes with fluorescently labeled PIP3 for binding to the GRP-1 pleckstrin homology domain protein. An increase in PIP3 product results in a decrease in time-resolved FRET signal as the labeled fluorophore is displaced from the GRP-1. PI3K isoforms were assayed under initial rate conditions in the presence of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 2 × Km ATP (100–300 μm), 10 μm PIP2, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) DMSO at the following concentrations for each isoform: PI3Kα, β, δ at 25–50 pm and PI3Kγ at 2 nm. After an assay reaction time of 30 min at 25 °C, reactions were terminated with a final concentration of 10 mm EDTA, 10 nm labeled PIP3, and 35 nm europium-labeled GRP-1 detector protein before reading time-resolved FRET on an Envision plate reader (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 615/665 nm; delay, 100 μs; and read window, 500 μs). The data were normalized based on positive (1 μm wortmannin) and negative (DMSO) controls, and IC50 values were calculated from the fit of the dose-response curves to a four-parameter equation. All IC50 values represent geometric mean values of a minimum of four determinations. These assays generally produced results within 3-fold of the reported mean. The KINOMEscan platform (DiscoveRx, San Diego, CA) was used to assess the interaction of idelalisib, at a concentration of 10 μm, with the ATP-binding site of a broad set of kinases (21.Fabian M.A. Biggs 3rd, W.H. Treiber D.K. Atteridge C.E. Azimioara M.D. Benedetti M.G. Carter T.A. Ciceri P. Edeen P.T. Floyd M. Ford J.M. Galvin M. Gerlach J.L. Grotzfeld R.M. Herrgard S. Insko D.E. Insko M.A. Lai A.G.

Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). To solutions of recombinant PI3Kδ (p110δ-p85α) (final concentration, 15 pm) in reaction buffer from the PI3K HTRF assay kit (Millipore) was added idelalisib at concentrations from 0 to 80 nm (final concentration). After a 1-h preincubation period, PIP2 was added to a final concentration of 10 μm, and ATP was added at concentrations from 0 to 1.5 mm to initiate the reaction. After 45 min, the reactions were quenched with a stop solution from the assay kit. A detection solution was then added to each well, and the mixture was further incubated for 2 h. Time-resolved fluorescence was measured with a Tecan Infinite M1000 plate reader, using an excitation wavelength of 330 nm and emission wavelengths of 620 and 665 nm. The ratio of emission at 665 nm to that at 620 nm was used as the measure of reaction rate. The rate data were fit globally using the equation v = Vmax [S]/(Km(1 + [I]/Ki) + [S](1 + [I]/αKi)), where v is the observed reaction rate, Vmax is the maximum reaction rate, [S] is the concentration of ATP, Km is the Michaelis constant for ATP, [I] is the concentration of idelalisib, Ki is the inhibition constant for idelalisib, and α is a multiplier for Ki that describes the competition behavior. Values of α ≫ 1 are indicative of competitive inhibition, values of α approximately equal to 1 imply noncompetitive inhibition, and values of α ≪ 1 are characteristic of uncompetitive inhibitors (22.Copeland R.A. Reversible inhibitors.Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. A. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 266-304Crossref Google Scholar). Solutions of 3 nm PI3Kδ-p 85α were preincubated with either 400 nm idelalisib or 100 nm wortmannin for 1 h. One microliter of solution was transferred to 99 μl of reaction buffer solution containing 10 μm PIP2 and 300 μm ATP to initiate the enzyme reaction. At 5-min intervals, samples from each reaction were quenched with HTRF stop solution, and fluorescence was measured using the detection kit as described above. The reactions were measured over a time frame of 40 min. Control reactions consisted of the reaction of 30 pm PI3Kδ in the absence of inhibitor, the reaction of 30 pm PI3Kδ in the presence of 400 nm idelalisib or 100 nm wortmannin, and the reaction of 30 pm PI3Kδ in the presence of 4 nm idelalisib or 1 nm wortmannin. The data were analyzed with linear least square fits to obtain reaction rates. ΔABD-p110δ was minimally biotinylated using a 1:1 molar ratio of protein to EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin (ThermoScientific; catalog no. 21338). The binding site was protected from biotinylation by adding 10 μm of idelalisib to 9 μm of protein prior to addition of EZ-link sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin. Biotinylation in the absence of idelalisib protection was also tested. Following incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the mixture was desalted using a Zeba spin desalting column (ThermoScientific; catalog no. 89883) pre-equilibrated in Biacore running buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm TCEP, 5% glycerol, 0.05% P20) to remove any unreacted biotin. The presence of one biotin molecule per protein molecule was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Characterization of inhibitor binding and dissociation was performed using a Biacore T100 instrument and research grade series S CM5 sensor chips (GE Healthcare; catalog no. BR-1005-30). Before use, CM5 sensor chips were preconditioned using two 6-s pulses each of 100 mm HCl, 50 mm NaOH, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and deionized H2O at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. Approximately 15,000 response units (RU) of neutravidin was immobilized on all four surfaces via standard amine-coupling chemistry (GE Healthcare; catalog no. BR-1000-50) in HBS-P buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% P20). Biotinylated protein was injected over separate flow cells to achieve capture levels ranging between 6,000 and 14,000 response units. Any remaining free sites on neutravidin were blocked with two 5-min pulses of 50 μm EZ-Link-Amine-PEG2-Biotin (ThermoScientific; catalog no. 21346) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Idelalisib at concentrations of 0.12, 0.37, 1.1, 3.3, 10, and 30 nm (in duplicate) was injected for a 90-s association time and a 1–200-s dissociation time at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. Wortmannin was injected on a separate sensor chip at a concentration of 2 μm for an 8-min association phase and a 1-hour dissociation phase. At the end of each injection cycle, the injection needle and tubing were washed with 50% DMSO using the “extra wash” command. A five-point DMSO concentration series (ranging from 0.8% to 1.2% DMSO) was included to generate a calibration curve to correct for excluded volume effects. Sensorgrams were double-referenced and corrected for solvent effects using Scrubber 2.0c software (Biologic Software, Campbell, Australia) but fitted using both Scrubber and CLAMP software (23.Myszka D.G.

Three independent surfaces were globally fit for the association and dissociation rates ka and ka, while floating the maximum binding response (Rmax) and mass transport (kt) constant for each surface. The solutions from the fits for all three surfaces from both Scrubber and CLAMP all showed ka*Rmax/kt values of <5 (a measure of the suitability of the solution to yield unique values for ka and kd) (26.Karlsson R.

Additionally, kinetic values derived from the global fit using CLAMP software were not highly correlated. The observed correlation coefficients for ka versus kd were 0.62 and 0.67 in replicate experiments, demonstrating that although the sensorgrams are influenced by mass transport, a unique solution for these parameters can be determined (24.Myszka D.G.

Both fitting routines yielded values for ka and kd for identical surfaces that did not differ appreciably (< 4.5%). For wortmannin, only an off-rate analysis was performed. Crystals used for seeding were obtained by vapor diffusion at 20 °C with 25 nl of 11 mg/ml ΔABD-p110δ and 0.9 mm of a p110δ inhibitor in protein storage buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 50 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1% v/v ethylene glycol, 1% (w/v) betaine, 0.3 μm CHAPS, and 5 mm TCEP) added to 25 nl of reservoir solution (25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 m bis-tris (pH 6.5). Crystals were pulverized, pooled together in the reservoir solution, vortexed with a Seed-Bead (Hampton Research) for 45 s, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. For seeding crystallization trials, the frozen seed was thawed and diluted 500-fold in 25% (v/v) PEG 300, 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5). Preparation of diffraction quality ΔABD-p110δ:idelalisib crystals started with a mixture of 0.48 μl of 2.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 0.30 μl of 20 mm ligand, and 12 μl of 12 mg/ml ΔABD-p110δ in storage buffer (described above). The mixture was allowed to sit for 1 h at room temperature instead of 4 °C to prevent the formation of white precipitate. Seeded vapor diffusion droplets were assembled by adding 90 nl of the 500-fold diluted seed (described above) to 100 nl of the n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside-ligand-ΔABD-p110δ mixture. The droplets were equilibrated against reservoir wells containing 50 μl of 1% to 30% (v/v) PEG 300, 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.5) at 20 °C. Crystals appeared in 2–5 days across the 1% to 30% PEG range.

The inhibitor and surrounding ATP-binding site are very clearly defined in the electron density maps. The coordinates as well as the diffraction data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under code 4XE0. Table 1 shows the idelalisib IC50 values for each class I isoform measured in the presence of 2 × Km ATP. The IC50 of idelalisib for PI3Kδ is 19 nm, whereas the IC50 values for PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, and PI3Kγ are 8,600, 4,000, and 2,100 nm, respectively. Thus, idelalisib potently inhibits PI3Kδ and is selective relative to the other class I isoforms (453-, 210-, and 110-fold selective against the α, β, and γ isoforms, respectively).

The activity of PI3Kδ was measured at various concentrations of ATP and idelalisib, and the data were fit globally to the competition expression described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are shown in Fig. 2. The global fit yielded the following kinetic parameters: Km = 37 ± 3 μm and Ki = 1.5 ± 0.1 nm. The measured Km value of 37 μm from the competition data was slightly lower than the value reported in Table 1, but this difference did not significantly affect the data analysis. The fit for the parameter α gave a very high value that reached the limits of the data fitting program. The high value of α (α ≫ 1) demonstrates ATP-competitive inhibition by idelalisib. As confirmation of the ATP competition, a fit of the kinetic data with a pure competitive model gave identical values for Km and Ki with the same goodness of fit (data not shown). Along with the kinetic characterization of idelalisib described above, two additional studies showed that it is a reversible inhibitor. Dilution experiments showed that the kinase can be completely inhibited with idelalisib at concentrations ∼20-fold greater than its IC50. However, enzyme activity was quickly recovered following a 1:100 dilution of the enzyme-inhibitor complex into a buffer solution containing the ATP and PIP2 substrates. DMSO and the irreversible inhibitor wortmannin were used as control compounds (Fig. 3, A and B). The rate of PIP2 phosphorylation upon dilution was approximately one-half of that of the DMSO control. This rate is consistent with the steady-state reaction rate of PI3Kδ in the presence of 4 nm idelalisib. Because the reaction was sampled at 5-min intervals, no distinct kinetic phase for compound dissociation was observed. However, based on the linearity of the progress curve, the dissociation of inhibitor likely occurred within the first few minutes of reaction time. In contrast, enzyme preincubated with wortmannin did not show detectable recovery of activity upon"

However, the tissue penetration depth of laser scanning microscopy is limited by light scattering and/or absorption by the tissue. Recently, several optical clearing reagents have been proposed for visualization in fixed specimens. However, they require complicated protocols or long treatment times. Here we report the effects of 2,2′-thiodiethanol (TDE) solutions as an optical clearing reagent for fixed mouse brains expressing a yellow fluorescent protein. Immersion of fixed brains in TDE solutions rapidly (within 30 min in the case of 400-µm-thick fixed brain slices) increased their transparency and enhanced the penetration depth in both confocal and two-photon microscopy. In addition, we succeeded in visualizing dendritic spines along single dendrites at deep positions in fixed thick brain slices. These results suggest that our proposed protocol using TDE solution is a rapid and useful method for optical clearing of fixed specimens expressing fluorescent proteins."

We previously reported that α5β1 integrin promotes osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal skeletal cells (MSCs), but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we determined the signaling mechanisms induced by α5β1 integrin interaction with its high-affinity ligand CRRETAWAC in murine and human MSCs and in vivo. We show that cyclized CRRETAWAC fully displaced MSC adhesion to FN, whereas related peptides lacking the full RRET sequence produced a partial displacement, indicating that RRET acts as an RGD-like sequence that is required to antagonize FN-mediated cell adhesion. However, all peptides increased focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, OSE2 transcriptional activity, osteoblast gene expression, and matrix mineralization in MSCs, indicating that peptide-induced α5β1 integrin priming can promote osteogenic differentiation independently of the RRET sequence. Biochemical analyses showed that peptide-induced α5β1 integrin priming transiently increased PI3K/Akt phosphorylation and promoted Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional activity independently of RRET. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K activity reduced osteoblast differentiation and abolished Wnt regulatory gene expression induced by α5β1 integrin priming. In vivo, systemic delivery of cyclized GACRETAWACGA linked to (DSS)6 to allow delivery to bone-forming sites for 6 weeks increased serum osteocalcin levels and improved long bone mass and microarchitecture in SAMP-6 senescent osteopenic mice.

In this study, we report a novel mechanism by which priming of α5β1 integrin in MSCs promotes osteoblast differentiation through activation of PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a model that can translate into improved bone microarchitecture in senescent osteopenic mice. Murine pluripotent mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human primary MSCs derived from the bone marrow stroma were purchased from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 1% l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin.

To determine the role of the RRET sequence, we used the related peptides CRRTAWAC and CRETAWAC, which lack the full RRET sequence. All peptides were synthesized and flanked by GA residues next to cysteines (GACRRETAWACGA, GACRRTAWACGA, and GACRETAWACGA) to allow for cyclization and stability (26Fromigué O. Brun J. Marty C.

The completed peptides were cleaved from the resin and side chain-deprotected by treatment with the scavengers water/triisopropylsilane/dithiothreitol/phenol/trifluoroacetic acid (2.5:2.5:2.5:2.5:90, v/v/w/w/v) for 30 min under microwave radiation (Discover; temperature, 38 °C; power, 20 watts). The cyclization of (DSS)6-GACRETAWACGA was performed for 24 h at room temperature in water/acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (50:50:0.1) with 1.2 eq of Aldrithiol-4 (Sigma-Aldrich) under conditions of high dilution (1.10−4 m) to avoid formation of the corresponding dimeric cyclopeptide. The corresponding cyclic peptide and (DSS)6-GRGESP were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a Shimadzu preparative HPLC system with a reverse-phase HPLC column (Phenomenex C12 Jupiter Proteo, 90 Å, 21.2 × 250 mm) with mixture of aqueous 0.1% (v/v) TFA (system A) and 0.1% (v/v) TFA in acetonitrile (system B) as the mobile phase (flow rate of 15 ml/min) and employing UV detection at 220 nm. Characterizations of the peptides were performed by mass spectrometry on a Q-Tof Ultima GLOBAL hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight instrument. The predicted and observed high-resolution masses for (DSS)6-GRGESP (C83H129N27O52) were 2336.8358 and 2336.7764 Da, respectively. The predicted and observed high-resolution masses for (DSS)6-GACRETAWACGA (C108H162N34O58S2) were 2928.0292 and 2928.0332 Da, respectively. To determine cell adhesion in response to the peptides, human (hMSCs) and mouse (mMSCs) MSCs were resuspended in DMEM and 0.5% BSA and incubated with cyclized peptides or a specific anti-α5β1 integrin antibody (40 μg/ml; MAB1969, Millipore) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell adhesion to a plate coated with 20 μg/ml human FN for 90 min at 37 °C and washed with 1% BSA was tested after 10 min at 37 °C. The plates were washed twice with DMEM, and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and quantified using the crystal violet assay (Sigma). hMSCs and mMSCs were grown to 80% confluence, serum-starved for 4 h, treated for 30 min with 50 ng/ml PDGF (used as a positive control; R&D Systems) or the indicated peptide (70 μm), and fixed. Total and phosphorylated (Tyr-397) FAK levels were determined by ELISA (FACE FAK assay, Active Motif, La Hulpe, Belgium). To test RUNX2 transcriptional activity, mMSCs were cotransfected with 0.3 μg/well p6OSE-Luc (a luciferase expression plasmid containing six RUNX2-binding sites), pControl-Luc plasmid (a luciferase expression plasmid without RUNX2 binding used as a control), or phRL-SV40 (a Renilla expression plasmid without a RUNX2-binding site used as an internal transfection control). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 70 μm peptides or 100 ng/ml BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein-2; used as a positive control; R&D Systems) for 24 h, and luciferase and Renilla activities were determined sequentially using a Renilla luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla activity to avoid transfection variability and to pControl-Luc to normalize the luciferase background. Results are expressed as relative luciferase units. For the TOPFlash luciferase reporter assays, cells were cotransfected with 0.3 μg/well TOPFlash or FOPFlash and 10 ng/well phRL-SV40, and CM was used as a positive control (47Haÿ E. Laplantine E.

https://openalex.org/W2086748852,"All evidence so far suggests that the absolute spatial orientation of an experiment never affects its outcome. This is reflected in the Standard Model of physics by requiring all particles and fields to be invariant under Lorentz transformations. The most well-known test of this important cornerstone of physics are Michelson-Morley-type experiments\cite{MM, Herrmann2009,Eisele2009} verifying the isotropy of the speed of light. Lorentz symmetry also implies that the kinetic energy of an electron should be independent of the direction of its velocity, \textit{i.e.,} its dispersion relation should be isotropic in space. In this work, we search for violation of Lorentz symmetry for electrons by performing an electronic analogue of a Michelson-Morley experiment. We split an electron-wavepacket bound inside a calcium ion into two parts with different orientations and recombine them after a time evolution of 95ms. As the Earth rotates, the absolute spatial orientation of the wavepackets changes and anisotropies in the electron dispersion would modify the phase of the interference signal. To remove noise, we prepare a pair of ions in a decoherence-free subspace, thereby rejecting magnetic field fluctuations common to both ions\cite{Roos2006}. After a 23 hour measurement, we limit the energy variations to $h\times 11$ mHz ($h$ is Planck's constant), verifying that Lorentz symmetry is preserved at the level of $1\times10^{-18}$. We improve on the Lorentz-violation limits for the electron by two orders of magnitude\cite{Hohensee2013c}. We can also interpret our result as testing the rotational invariance of the Coloumb potential, improving limits on rotational anisotropies in the speed of light by a factor of five\cite{Herrmann2009,Eisele2009}. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of quantum information techniques in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model."
https://openalex.org/W1973637889,"Oncogenetic events and unique phenomena of the tumor microenvironment together induce adaptive metabolic responses that may offer new diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets of cancer. Hypoxia, or low oxygen tension, represents a well-established and universal feature of the tumor microenvironment and has been linked to increased tumor aggressiveness as well as resistance to conventional oncological treatments. Previous studies have provided important insights into hypoxia induced changes of the transcriptome and proteome; however, how this translates into changes at the metabolite level remains to be defined. Here, we have investigated dynamic, time-dependent effects of hypoxia on the cancer cell metabolome across all families of macromolecules, i.e., carbohydrate, protein, lipid and nucleic acid, in human glioblastoma cells. Using GC/MS and LC/MS/MS, 345 and 126 metabolites were identified and quantified in cells and corresponding media, respectively, at short (6 h), intermediate (24 h), and prolonged (48 h) incubation at normoxic or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. In conjunction, we performed gene array studies with hypoxic and normoxic cells following short and prolonged incubation. We found that levels of several key metabolites varied with the duration of hypoxic stress. In some cases, metabolic changes corresponded with hypoxic regulation of key pathways at the transcriptional level. Our results provide new insights into the metabolic response of glioblastoma cells to hypoxia, which should stimulate further work aimed at targeting cancer cell adaptive mechanisms to microenvironmental stress."
https://openalex.org/W2004979384,"The death of massive stars is believed to involve aspheric explosions initiated by the collapse of an iron core. The specifics of how these catastrophic explosions proceed remain uncertain due, in part, to limited observational constraints on various processes that can introduce asymmetries deep inside the star. Here we present near-infrared observations of the young Milky Way supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, descendant of a type IIb core-collapse explosion, and a three-dimensional map of its interior, unshocked ejecta. The remnant's interior has a bubble-like morphology that smoothly connects to and helps explain the multi-ringed structures seen in the remnant's bright reverse shocked main shell of expanding debris. This internal structure may have originated from turbulent mixing processes that encouraged the development of outwardly expanding plumes of radioactive 56Ni-rich ejecta. If this is true, substantial amounts of its decay product, 56Fe, may still reside in these interior cavities."
https://openalex.org/W1995543194,"The mammalian poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family includes ADP-ribosyltransferases with diphtheria toxin homology (ARTD). Most members have mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. PARP13/ARTD13, also called zinc finger antiviral protein, has roles in viral immunity and microRNA-mediated stress responses. PARP13 features a divergent PARP homology domain missing a PARP consensus sequence motif; the domain has enigmatic functions and apparently lacks catalytic activity. We used x-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical analyses to investigate the structural requirements for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in human PARP13 and two of its functional partners in stress granules: PARP12/ARTD12, and PARP15/BAL3/ARTD7. The crystal structure of the PARP homology domain of PARP13 shows obstruction of the canonical active site, precluding NAD+ binding. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that this closed cleft conformation is maintained in solution. Introducing consensus side chains in PARP13 did not result in 3-aminobenzamide binding, but in further closure of the site. Three-dimensional alignment of the PARP homology domains of PARP13, PARP12, and PARP15 illustrates placement of PARP13 residues that deviate from the PARP family consensus. Introducing either one of two of these side chains into the corresponding positions in PARP15 abolished PARP15 ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Taken together, our results show that PARP13 lacks the structural requirements for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2029290423,"Highly conserved molecular chaperone Hsp70 heat shock proteins play a key role in maintaining protein homeostasis (proteostasis). DnaK, a major Hsp70 in Escherichia coli, has been widely used as a paradigm for studying Hsp70s. In the absence of ATP, purified DnaK forms low-ordered oligomer, whereas ATP binding shifts the equilibrium toward the monomer. Recently, we solved the crystal structure of DnaK in complex with ATP. There are two molecules of DnaK-ATP in the asymmetric unit. Interestingly, the interfaces between the two molecules of DnaK are large with good surface complementarity, suggesting functional importance of this crystallographic dimer. Biochemical analyses of DnaK protein supported the formation of dimer in solution. Furthermore, our cross-linking experiment based on the DnaK-ATP structure confirmed that DnaK forms specific dimer in an ATP-dependent manner. To understand the physiological function of the dimer, we mutated five residues on the dimer interface. Four mutations, R56A, T301A, N537A, and D540A, resulted in loss of chaperone activity and compromised the formation of dimer, indicating the functional importance of the dimer. Surprisingly, neither the intrinsic biochemical activities, the ATP-induced allosteric coupling, nor GrpE co-chaperone interaction is affected appreciably in all of the mutations except for R56A. Unexpectedly, the interaction with co-chaperone Hsp40 is significantly compromised. In summary, this study suggests that DnaK forms a transient dimer upon ATP binding, and this dimer is essential for the efficient interaction of DnaK with Hsp40."

Despite their extensive use in preclinical studies, the immunogenicity of the yeast-derived IZ and bacteriophage-derived Fd has not been properly evaluated. When IZ and Fd would be routinely used for future clinical applications and vaccines, immune responses against IZ, and Fd could affect the effectiveness of these therapeutics and vaccines. For example, with repeated administration of therapeutic proteins, IZ- or Fd-specific antibodies (Abs) might enhance systemic clearance of the protein thereby decreasing the efficiency of the therapy (29.Hemmer B. Stüve O. Kieseier B. Schellekens H. Hartung H.-P.

Reynolds H.M. Lumicisi B. Bryson C.J. Immunogenicity of protein therapeutics: The key causes, consequences and challenges.Self Nonself. 2010; 1: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Here we report that the IZ and Fd trimerization domains induce potent Ab responses in vaccinated animals. To dampen the anti-IZ response, we designed an IZ variant with four potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) at strategic positions in the heptad repeat domain of IZ (IZN4). Protein trimerization was not affected by the addition of four glycans to the IZ domain. Moreover, IZN4 induced significantly lower IZ-specific Ab responses in vaccinated animals when fused to two different antigens, without hampering the immune response against these antigens. This novel IZN4 trimerization domain should be useful for trimeric protein vaccines and therapeutics. The expression vector for the HIV-1 subtype B JRFL Env SOSIP.R6 (Env) with a C-terminal IZ (RMKQIEDKIEEILSKIYHIENEIARIKKLIGER) and histidine tag has been described elsewhere extensively (13.Melchers M.

In short, the Env construct used in this study (Env-IZ) contains a disulfide between gp120 and gp41; an improved furin cleavage site (R6); an I559P mutations to improve trimerization; a codon-optimized GCN4-pII isoleucine zipper (IZ); a GGGGTGGGGTG-linker between the IZ and Env moiety; a C-terminal histidine tag (His-tag) (1.Harbury P.B.

The codon-optimized influenza hemagglutinin (HA) sequence (GenBankTM: ACU65077.1, residues 10–509) was synthesized (Mr. Gene) and was cloned to replace the Env sequence in the same expression vector yielding [HA]GGGGTGGGGTGRMKQI EDKIEEILSKIYHIENEIARIKKLIGERHHHHHHHH (HA-IZ). To obtain Env-Fd and HA-Fd, the codon-optimized T4 bacteriophage Fd sequence (GYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFL) was cloned in place of the IZ sequence. Env-IZ variants with the different PNGS were generated using the Quickchange mutagenesis kit (Agilent). For HA-IZN4 we replaced the IZ in HA-IZ with the IZN4 (NGTGRMKQIEDKIENITSKIY NITNEIARIKKLIGNRT) sequence from Env-IZN4. For the constructs used in rabbit vaccinations (i.e. Env-IZ, Env-IZN4, HA-IZ, and Env-IZN4), a stop-codon was introduced before the His-tag to avoid the induction of antibodies against the tag. mAbs were gifts or purchased from the following sources: Polymun Scientific (2G12); Progenics Pharmaceuticals (PA1, soluble CD4, CD4-IgG2); J. Mascola and P. Kwong, Vaccine Research Center (VRC01); D. Burton, The Scripps Research Institute (PGT121); J. Robinson, Tulane University (48d); H. Katinger, through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (2F5); Sino Biologicals (H5 HA mAb); Genscript (anti-His-tag mAb). HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were transfected with PEImax (Polysciences) and plasmid DNA expressing IZ- and Fd-fusion proteins. For the experiments shown in Fig. 3A, plasmid DNA encoding the protease furin was co-transfected in a 1:1 ratio with Env-IZ or Env-IZN4 plasmid to induce cleavage of the gp120 and gp41ecto-IZN4 subunits of the Env-IZN4 proteins. When indicated, kifunensine (5 μg/ml, Cayman Chemical) was added during transfection to block mannose trimming of N-linked glycans (33.Elbein A.D. Tropea J.E. Mitchell M. Kaushal G.P. Kifunensine, a potent inhibitor of the glycoprotein processing mannosidase I.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15599-15605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To remove oligomannose glycans from Env-IZ and Env-IZN4, 20 μl supernatant of kifunensine-treated HEK293T cells was treated with 1 μl of endoglycosidase H (Sigma Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins in HEK293T cell supernatants were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE). Western blotting was performed using anti-His-tag mAb (0.13 μg/ml), PA1 (0.2 μg/ml), or anti-H5 HA mAb (0.5 μg/ml) for SDS-PAGE and 2G12 (0.1 μg/ml) for BN-PAGE. Proteins were detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse Ab (for anti-His-tag, PA1, and anti-H5 HA mAbs) or goat anti-human Ab (for 2G12). HEK293T cell supernatants containing Env-IZ, Env-IZN2/3a/3b/4, HA-IZ, HA-IZN4, or HA-Fd were diluted 1:2 in TBS/10%FCS and immobilized on Ni-NTA HisSorb 96-well plates (Qiagen) (100 μl/well) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washing steps with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), sera from mice, rats, and rabbits was serially diluted in 2% skimmed milk/20% sheep serum and added for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, HRP-labeled goat-anti-mouse, goat-anti-rat, or goat-anti-rabbit Abs (Jackson Immunoresearch) were added for 1 h at a 1:5000 dilution (final concentration 0.33 μg/ml) in TBS/2% skimmed milk, followed by five washes with TBS/0.05% Tween-20. Colorimetric detection was performed using a solution containing 1% 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01% H2O2, 100 mm sodium acetate and 100 mm citric acid. Midpoint titers were calculated using GraphPad Prism (version 5.01). Anti-gp120 Ab titers were measured by D7324-capture ELISA as described previously (34.Van Montfort T. Melchers M. Isik G. Menis S. Huang P.-S. Matthews K. Michael E. Berkhout B. Schief W.R. Moore J.P. Sanders R.W.

Reactivity of Env proteins with mAbs or receptor mimics was measured by anti-Env-IZ ELISA immobilized on Ni-NTA plates as described above, using HRP-labeled goat-anti-human as the secondary Ab.

HA-Fd, HA-IZ, Env-Fd containing transfection supernatants were concentrated 8-fold using Vivaspin20 filters (Sartorius) and incubated with rabbit sera for 1h at RT. Subsequently, sera were serially diluted in 2% skimmed milk with 20% sheep serum, supplemented with the corresponding 8-fold concentrated supernatant. Subsequent ELISA assay steps were performed as described above. Relative Ab binding to the Env and IZ domains in rabbit serum was assessed using the midpoint binding titers as follows (Fig. 1C): For Env: ((Env-Fd − HA-Fd)/(HA-IZ + Env-Fd)) × 100%; for IZ: ((HA-IZ − HA-Fd)/(HA-IZ + Env-Fd − HA-Fd)) × 100%. For the experiments shown in Fig. 1A four outbred NMRI mice, four Wistar rats, and four New Zealand White rabbits were immunized in the abdominal dermis with endotoxin-free Env-IZ plasmid DNA using gene gun technology at week 0, 2, and 4. For mice and rats we used 20 μg of plasmid DNA and 125 μg of DNA was used for rabbits. For the experiment shown in Fig. 1B, sera from rabbits immunized with Env-Fd (Env from clade B isolate YU2 with C-terminal foldon domain, described extensively elsewhere) (36.Yang X. Lee J. Mahony E.M. Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Highly stable trimers formed by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoproteins fused with the trimeric motif of T4 bacteriophage fibritin.J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) were obtained from an ongoing vaccination experiment in New Zealand White rabbits that is done in collaboration with IAVI. These rabbits were immunized with 30 μg of Env-Fd protein in ISCOMATRIXTM adjuvant at weeks 0, 4, and 20. In previous vaccination experiments using similar protocols, five to six animals per group provided enough statistical power to detect significant differences between two groups in binding antibody measurements (35.Melchers M.

Therefore, we used six New Zealand White rabbits for the experiments in Fig. 5, A and B that were immunized in the abdominal dermis at week 0, 2, 4, 8 with 125 μg endotoxin-free DNA encoding Env-IZ, Env-IZN4, HA-IZ, and Env-IZN4 using gene gun technology(35.Melchers M.

All protocols dealing with animal manipulations were in accordance with guidelines published by FELASA (Federation of European Animal Science Association) and GV-SOLAS (German Society of Laboratory Animal Science) and were reviewed by the Harlan, MFD Diagnostics, or Davids Biotechnologie Animal Care Committees, as appropriate. To determine the immunogenicity of the IZ domain, we immunized mice, rats and rabbits with plasmid DNA encoding the HIV-1 Env from strain JRFL containing an IZ domain at the C terminus (Env-IZ) (32.Sanders R.W. Vesanen M. Schuelke N. Master A. Schiffner L. Kalyanaraman R. Paluch M. Berkhout B. Maddon P.J. Olson W.C. Lu M. Moore J.P.

Virol. 2012; 86: 2488-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, the immunogenicity of the Fd domain was studied in rabbits that were immunized in an independent study with Env from the strain YU2, containing the Fd domain at the C terminus (Env-Fd). Sera from all immunized animals were tested for IZ- and Fd-specific Ab responses by testing the response against fusion proteins in which IZ and Fd were fused to influenza hemagglutinin from strain A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (HA). We observed high levels of Abs against IZ in sera from Env-IZ-vaccinated mice, rats and rabbits (Fig. 1A). Similarly, we observed strong anti-Fd response in sera from Env-Fd-vaccinated rabbits (Fig. 1B), but not vice versa. Thus, both IZ and Fd are highly immunogenic. To analyze the relative amounts of IZ-specific versus Env-specific Abs, we performed a competition ELISA in which we depleted either Env- or IZ-specific Abs. In the four tested rabbits, 36 to 61% of the relative binding Ab response against the Env-IZ immunogen was specific for the IZ-domain (Fig. 1C). We conclude that the relatively small IZ trimerization domain (12 kDa) was highly immunogenic in rabbits in comparison with Env (∼400 kDa). Silencing of unwanted immunodominant Ab epitopes can be achieved by using N-linked glycans (N-glycans) (28.Eggink D. Goff P.H. Palese P.

Immunol. 2013; 191: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated whether it would be possible to shield the immunogenic IZ protein surface with N-glycans. The IZ domain is a heptad repeat in which isoleucines on the first (a) and fourth (d) position in the α-helix direct trimerization (Fig. 2A). Introduction of PNGS by means of the amino acid motif aspargine-X-serine/threonine (NX(S/T)) is only possible on the cde positions in the heptad repeat, because other options would eliminate the isoleucines responsible for oligomerization, or would result in a steric clash of the N-glycan with a neighboring α-helix. We chose to use NXT motifs over NXS, because NXT motifs have a higher probability of glycosylation (40.Kasturi L. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. The hydroxy amino acid in an Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequon can influence N-linked core glycosylation efficiency and the level of expression of a cell surface glycoprotein.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14756-14761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations we selected four positions for insertion of NXT motifs that were ultimately combined in a variant that had all four motifs (Fig. 2, B and D). Note that the first PNGS is in the linker region between Env and IZ. In silico prediction suggested that introducing four NXT motifs in IZ (IZN4) had a negligible effect on the tertiary structure of the IZ (Fig. 2B). Modeling of IZ glycans on the IZN4 trimer showed that the accessibility of underlying protein surface was dramatically reduced (Fig. 2C). We sequentially intro"
https://openalex.org/W2064077309,"Hearing mechanisms in baleen whales (Mysticeti) are essentially unknown but their vocalization frequencies overlap with anthropogenic sound sources. Synthetic audiograms were generated for a fin whale by applying finite element modeling tools to X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. We CT scanned the head of a small fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) in a scanner designed for solid-fuel rocket motors. Our computer (finite element) modeling toolkit allowed us to visualize what occurs when sounds interact with the anatomic geometry of the whale’s head. Simulations reveal two mechanisms that excite both bony ear complexes, (1) the skull-vibration enabled bone conduction mechanism and (2) a pressure mechanism transmitted through soft tissues. Bone conduction is the predominant mechanism. The mass density of the bony ear complexes and their firmly embedded attachments to the skull are universal across the Mysticeti, suggesting that sound reception mechanisms are similar in all baleen whales. Interactions between incident sound waves and the skull cause deformations that induce motion in each bony ear complex, resulting in best hearing sensitivity for low-frequency sounds. This predominant low-frequency sensitivity has significant implications for assessing mysticete exposure levels to anthropogenic sounds. The din of man-made ocean noise has increased steadily over the past half century. Our results provide valuable data for U.S. regulatory agencies and concerned large-scale industrial users of the ocean environment. This study transforms our understanding of baleen whale hearing and provides a means to predict auditory sensitivity across a broad spectrum of sound frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W1969087040,"Climate change is expected to change the distribution of species. For long-lived, sessile species such as trees, tracking the warming climate depends on seedling colonization of newly favorable areas. We compare the distribution of seedlings and mature trees for all but the rarest tree species in California, Oregon and Washington, United States of America, a large, environmentally diverse region. Across 46 species, the mean annual temperature of the range of seedlings was 0.120°C colder than that of the range of trees (95% confidence interval from 0.096 to 0.144°C). The extremes of the seedling distributions also shifted towards colder temperature than those of mature trees, but the change was less pronounced. Although the mean elevation and mean latitude of the range of seedlings was higher than and north of those of the range of mature trees, elevational and latitudinal shifts run in opposite directions for the majority of the species, reflecting the lack of a direct biological relationship between species' distributions and those variables. The broad scale, environmental diversity and variety of disturbance regimes and land uses of the study area, the large number and exhaustive sampling of tree species, and the direct causal relationship between the temperature response and a warming climate, provide strong evidence to attribute the observed shifts to climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2020435303,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical sensor of energy sufficiency, acts as central metabolic switch in cell metabolism. Once activated by low energy status, AMPK phosphorylates key regulatory substrates and turns off anabolic biosynthetic pathways. In contrast, the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is active when there are sufficient nutrients for anabolic reactions. A critical factor regulating mTOR is phosphatidic acid (PA), a central metabolite of membrane lipid biosynthesis and the product of the phospholipase D (PLD)-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. PLD is a downstream target of the GTPase Rheb, which is turned off in response to AMPK via the tuberous sclerosis complex. Although many studies have linked AMPK with mTOR, very little is known about the connection between AMPK and PLD. In this report, we provide evidence for reciprocal regulation of PLD by AMPK and regulation of AMPK by PLD and PA. Suppression of AMPK activity led to an increase in PLD activity, and conversely, activation of AMPK suppressed PLD activity. Suppression of PLD activity resulted in elevated AMPK activity. Exogenously supplied PA abolished the inhibitory effects of elevated AMPK activity on mTOR signaling. In contrast, exogenously supplied PA could not overcome the effect AMPK activation if either mTOR or Raptor was suppressed, indicating that the inhibitory effects of PLD and PA on AMPK activity are mediated by mTOR. These data suggest a reciprocal feedback mechanism involving AMPK and the PLD/mTOR signaling node in cancer cells with therapeutic implications. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a critical sensor of energy sufficiency, acts as central metabolic switch in cell metabolism. Once activated by low energy status, AMPK phosphorylates key regulatory substrates and turns off anabolic biosynthetic pathways. In contrast, the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is active when there are sufficient nutrients for anabolic reactions. A critical factor regulating mTOR is phosphatidic acid (PA), a central metabolite of membrane lipid biosynthesis and the product of the phospholipase D (PLD)-catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine.

In nucleus pulposus (NP) cells, our previous work demonstrated that PHD isoforms have a differential contribution in controlling hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α degradation and activity. Recently we have shown that a regulatory relationship exists between PHD3 and inflammatory cytokines in NP cells. With respect to PHD2, the most abundant PHD isoform in NP cells, very little is known concerning its function and regulation under inflammatory conditions that characterize intervertebral disc degeneration. Here, we show that PHD2 is a potent regulator of the catabolic activities of TNF-α; silencing of PHD2 significantly decreased TNF-α-induced expression of catabolic markers including SDC4, MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS5, as well as several inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, while partially restoring aggrecan and collagen II expression. Use of NF-κB reporters with ShPHD2, SiHIF-1α, as well as p65−/−, PHD2−/−, and PHD3−/− cells, shows that PHD2 serves as a co-activator of NF-κB/p65 signaling in HIF-1-independent fashion. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous and exogenously expressed tagged proteins, as well as fluorescence microscopy, indicates that following TNF-α treatment, PHD2 interacts and co-localizes with p65. Conversely, loss of function experiments using lentivirally delivered Sh-p65, Sh-IKKβ, and NF-κB inhibitor confirmed that cytokine-dependent PHD2 expression in NP cells requires NF-κB signaling. These findings clearly demonstrate that PHD2 forms a regulatory circuit with TNF-α via NF-κB and thereby plays an important role in enhancing activity of this cytokine.

https://openalex.org/W1994345812,"Human α-synuclein (α-Syn) is a natively unstructured protein whose aggregation into amyloid fibrils is associated with Parkinson disease (PD) pathogenesis. Mutations of α-Syn, E46K, A53T, and A30P, have been linked to the familial form of PD. In vitro aggregation studies suggest that increased propensity to form non-fibrillar oligomers is the shared property of these familial PD-associated mutants. However, the structural basis of the altered aggregation propensities of these PD-associated mutants is not yet clear. To understand this, we studied the site-specific structural dynamics of wild type (WT) α-Syn and its three PD mutants (A53T, E46K, and A30P). Tryptophan (Trp) was substituted at the N terminus, central hydrophobic region, and C terminus of all α-Syns. Using various biophysical techniques including time-resolved fluorescence studies, we show that irrespective of similar secondary structure and early oligomerization propensities, familial PD-associated mutations alter the site-specific microenvironment, solvent exposure, and conformational flexibility of the protein. Our results further show that the common structural feature of the three PD-associated mutants is more compact and rigid sites at their N and C termini compared with WT α-Syn that may facilitate the formation of a partially folded intermediate that eventually leads to their increased oligomerization propensities."

https://openalex.org/W2157085984,"Recent findings indicate that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer as well as autoimmune and several neurodegenerative diseases, and is thus a target for novel therapeutics. One disease that is related to aberrant protein degradation is multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disorder involving the processing and presentation of myelin autoantigens that leads to the destruction of axons. Here, we show that brain-derived proteasomes from SJL mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in an ubiquitin-independent manner generate significantly increased amounts of myelin basic protein peptides that induces cytotoxic lymphocytes to target mature oligodendrocytes ex vivo. Ten times enhanced release of immunogenic peptides by cerebral proteasomes from EAE-SJL mice is caused by a dramatic shift in the balance between constitutive and β1i(high) immunoproteasomes in the CNS of SJL mice with EAE. We found that during EAE, β1i is increased in resident CNS cells, whereas β5i is imported by infiltrating lymphocytes through the blood-brain barrier. Peptidyl epoxyketone specifically inhibits brain-derived β1i(high) immunoproteasomes in vitro (kobs/[I] = 240 M(-1)s(-1)), and at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, it ameliorates ongoing EAE in vivo. Therefore, our findings provide novel insights into myelin metabolism in pathophysiologic conditions and reveal that the β1i subunit of the immunoproteasome is a potential target to treat autoimmune neurologic diseases."

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the regulation of ribosome and tRNA synthesis was recently shown to involve the Cdc-like kinase Kns1 and the GSK-3 kinase Mck1. In this study, we explored additional roles for these conserved kinases in processes connected to the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). We conducted a synthetic chemical-genetic screen in a kns1Δ mck1Δ strain and identified many novel rapamycin-hypersensitive genes. Gene ontology analysis showed enrichment for TORC1-regulated processes (vesicle-mediated transport, autophagy, and regulation of cell size) and identified new connections to protein complexes including the protein kinase CK2. CK2 is considered to be a constitutively active kinase and in budding yeast, the holoenzyme comprises two regulatory subunits, Ckb1 and Ckb2, and two catalytic subunits, Cka1 and Cka2. We show that Ckb1 is differentially phosphorylated in vivo and that Kns1 mediates this phosphorylation when nutrients are limiting and under all tested stress conditions. We determined that the phosphorylation of Ckb1 does not detectably affect the stability of the CK2 holoenzyme but correlates with the reduced occupancy of Ckb1 on tRNA genes after rapamycin treatment. Thus, the differential occupancy of tRNA genes by CK2 is likely to modulate its activation of RNA polymerase III transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2078089677,"Heparanase, the exclusive mammalian heparan sulfate-degrading enzyme, has been suggested to be utilized by leukocytes to penetrate through the dense basement membranes surrounding blood venules. Despite its established role in tumor cell invasion, heparanase function in leukocyte extravasation has never been demonstrated. We found that TH1/TC1-type effector T cells are highly enriched for this enzyme, with a 3.6-fold higher heparanase mRNA expression compared with naive lymphocytes. Using adoptive transfer of wild-type and heparanase-deficient effector T cells into inflamed mice, we show that T-cell heparanase was not required for extravasation inside inflamed lymph nodes or skin. Leukocyte extravasation through acute inflamed skin vessels was also heparanase independent. Furthermore, neutrophils emigrated to the inflamed peritoneal cavity independently of heparanase expression on either the leukocytes or on the endothelial and mesothelial barriers, and overexpression of the enzyme on neutrophils did not facilitate their emigration. However, heparanase absence significantly reduced monocyte emigration into the inflamed peritoneal cavity. These results collectively suggest that neither leukocyte nor endothelial heparanase is required for T-cell and neutrophil extravasation through inflamed vascular barriers, whereas this enzyme is required for optimal monocyte recruitment to inflamed peritoneum.—Stoler-Barak, L., Petrovich, E., Aychek, T., Gurevich, I., Tal, O., Hatzav, M., Ilan, N., Feigelson, S.

This mechanism implies that anionic lipids interfere with electrostatic interactions of membrane proteins. The integrin αIIbβ3 transmembrane (TM) complex is stabilized by a membrane-proximal αIIb(Arg995)-β3(Asp723) interaction; here, we examine the influence of anionic lipids on this complex. Anionic lipids compete for αIIb(Arg995) contacts with β3(Asp723) but paradoxically do not diminish the contribution of αIIb(Arg995)-β3(Asp723) to TM complex stability. Overall, anionic lipids in annular positions stabilize the αIIbβ3 TM complex by up to 0.50 ± 0.02 kcal/mol relative to zwitterionic lipids in a headgroup structure-dependent manner. Comparatively, integrin receptor activation requires TM complex destabilization of 1.5 ± 0.2 kcal/mol, revealing a sizeable influence of lipid composition on TM complex stability. We implicate changes in lipid headgroup accessibility to small molecules (physical membrane characteristics) and specific but dynamic protein-lipid contacts in this TM helix-helix stabilization. Thus, anionic lipids in ubiquitous annular positions can benefit the stability of membrane proteins while leaving membrane-proximal electrostatic interactions intact."

Moreover, a recent report shows that dendritic spine morphogenesis depends on the interaction of dysbindin with WAVE2 and Abi-1 (26Ito H. Morishita R. Shinoda T. Iwamoto I. Sudo K. Okamoto K.

DISC1 has emerged as a susceptibility factor in mental disorders on the basis of the cosegregation of a balanced chromosomal translocation (t1;11) that disrupts the DISC1 gene in multiple psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia (10Straub R.E.

Neurosci. 2010; 13: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), all implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A considerable number of studies have characterized interacting partners of dysbindin and DISC1. Interestingly, several reports show that the protein interaction networks associated with dysbindin and DISC1 share common components, implying a common physiological pathway for these two major schizophrenia susceptibility factors (36Camargo L.M. Collura V. Rain J.C. Mizuguchi K. Hermjakob H. Kerrien S. Bonnert T.P. Whiting P.J. Brandon N.J.

Cytosolic protein interactions of the schizophrenia susceptibility gene dysbindin.J. Neurochem. 2010; 113: 1491-1503PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, dysbindin and DISC1 physically associate in vitro, although the biological relevance of this has not been investigated (38Ottis P. Bader V. Trossbach S.V. Kretzschmar H. Michel M. Leliveld S.R. Korth C. Convergence of two independent mental disease genes on the protein level: recruitment of dysbindin to cell-invasive disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 aggresomes.Biol.

In this study, we demonstrate the functional collaboration of dysbindin and DISC1 in the neurite outgrowth process which involves fine-tuning of dysbindin degradation by DISC1, and provide evidence of a convergent pathway where dysbindin and DISC1, two schizophrenia-associated proteins, cooperate. For yeast two-hybrid assays, pPC97-DISC1 and pPC86-NDEL1 were prepared as described previously (39Park Y.U. Jeong J. Lee H. Mun J.Y. Kim J.H. Lee J.S. Nguyen M.D. Han S.S. Suh P.G. Park S.K.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 17785-17790Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The human dysbindin coding sequence was amplified by PCR from a human dysbindin cDNA clone (clone ID 4139934, Open Biosystems, GenBank accession number BC011912) and inserted into the pPC86 vector (Invitrogen) using the SalI and NotI sites. Full-length human and mouse DISC1 constructs were prepared as described previously (39Park Y.U. Jeong J. Lee H. Mun J.Y. Kim J.H. Lee J.S. Nguyen M.D. Han S.S. Suh P.G. Park S.K.

For constructs of DISC1 fragments, corresponding regions of human DISC1 (hDISC1) were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) and pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma). For mouse dysbindin constructs, the full-length dysbindin coding sequence was amplified using reverse transcription products generated from CAD 2The abbreviations used are: CADCath.a-differentiatedEGFPenhanced GFPANOVAanalysis of varianceUPSubiquitin-proteasome systemFLfull-length. mouse neuroblastoma cells, subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), pUB-GFP (Addgene), pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma), and pCDNA3.1 Myc-His (Invitrogen). To construct the deletion mutant of dysbindin, a region of human dysbindin corresponding to the designated codon was amplified by PCR using EGFP-dysbindin as a template and inserted into pEGFP-N1. Sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. For shRNA constructs, mouse DISC1 shRNA was prepared following a previous description (39Park Y.U. Jeong J. Lee H. Mun J.Y. Kim J.H. Lee J.S. Nguyen M.D. Han S.S. Suh P.G. Park S.K. Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) plays essential roles in mitochondria in collaboration with Mitofilin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To generate the shRNA-resistant GFP-mouse DISC1 and mouse dysbindin constructs by inserting silent mutations in the shRNA target sequence in pUB-GFP (Addgene), site-directed mutagenesis of DISC1 and dysbindin was performed using PCR-based methods. The PCR primer sequences used were as follows: 5′-AAG ACT TTA AGT GAC AAA TCA AGG GAG GCA AAAGTGAAA-3′ for dysbindin and 5′-CGCACAATGAAGGCCAATACCGTCAAATGTATGGAAGTGTTG-3′ for DISC1.

HEK293T, HEK293, COS7, and CAD cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or VivaMagic (Vivagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For neuronal cultures, developing cortices were dissected from embryonic day 15 Institute for Cancer Research (CrljBgi:CD-1) mouse embryos in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). Dissected tissue was dissociated by treatment with DNase I (0.1%) and Trypsin (0.25%) for 6 min at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were diluted in plating medium, Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 10% horse serum (Gibco), and then plated onto cover slips coated with poly-d-lysine. Plating media was replaced with culture media (Neurobasal media supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics). Rabbit polyclonal anti-dysbindin was used as described previously (26Ito H. Morishita R. Shinoda T. Iwamoto I. Sudo K. Okamoto K. Nagata K. Dysbindin-1, WAVE2 and Abi-1 form a complex that regulates dendritic spine formation.Mol. Psychiatry. 2010; 15: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Anti-mDISC1 antibodies were a gift from Dr. Kaibuchi (University of Nagoya). A rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP protein (Molecular Probes), anti-FLAG (ABR), and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) were used. Anti-α tubulin (catalog no. DM1A), anti-GAPDH (catalog no. 6C5), anti-GFP (catalog no. B-2), anti-DISC1 (catalog no. N-16), and anti-Myc (catalog no. 9E10) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm glycerol-2-phosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)) and precleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g. Supernatants were denatured in SDS sample buffer by boiling for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Whole brain tissues from an Institute for Cancer Research mouse were homogenized in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and precleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated with antibody (0.5–1 μg) on a rocking platform for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C, and then 100 μl of 10% protein A-agarose (GE Healthcare) resuspended in the same lysis buffer was added and incubated with gentle shaking for an additional 90 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 2× SDS sample loading buffer. For the in vitro binding assay, transfected HEK293T cell lysates were incubated with 1 μg of anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, and then protein A-agarose beads (GE Healthcare) were added and incubated for an additional 90 min at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and incubated with 5 μg of GST-dysbindin for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g and rinsed four times with lysis buffer. Precipitates were subjected to anti-GST and anti-FLAG immunoblotting. Cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and incubated for 30 min in blocking solution (2% goat serum and 1% Triton X-100 in PBS). Cells were incubated with anti-Myc (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (1:2000, Molecular Probes) for 1.5 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Hoechst dye was used for nuclear staining, and cells on coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS and mounted in antifade medium (Molecular Probes). Pictures were taken with a confocal microscope (Olympus, FluoView-1000). HEK293 cells were transfected with HA-ubiquitin (a gift from Dr. Chin Ha Chung, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea) along with Myc-dysbindin and EGFP-DISC1 constructs. 48 h after transfection, cells were treated with 25 μm MG132 (Enzo) for 8 h prior to lysis. The cell lysates were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide and incubated with anti-Myc antibodies for 4 h. Protein A-agarose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in 2× SDS/PAGE sampling buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc, anti-GFP, and anti-HA antibodies. CAD cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics for 1 day and then transfected with the indicated constructs using VivaMagic (Vivagen). After 48 h of transfection, cells were detached using trypsin, diluted in DMEM with antibiotics, seeded again onto 12-well plates, and cultured for 72 h. Neurites on 150–250 fluorescent cells from three independent experiments were selected randomly, and neurites longer than the diameter of the soma were measured by ImageJ software (National Institute of Health). The length of the longest neurite and total neurite length were used for analyses. For cultured primary neurons, control red fluorescent protein (RFP) vector or RFP-expressing shRNAs were transfected into cells to visualize the neuronal morphology using Lipofectamine 2000 at days in vitro 0 and cultured for 3 days. Neurons were fixed, and neurite length was measured in randomly selected microscopic fields using a ×20 objective. Neurites on 190–249 transfected neurons from three independent experiments were measured by ImageJ software and analyzed blindly. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 software and are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA or Student's t test. To examine whether dysbindin interacts with DISC1, we employed a yeast-two-hybrid assay. We found that cotransformants containing dysbindin and DISC1 showed a positive signal, indicating interaction-dependent β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 1A). DISC1 and NDEL1 (nudE nuclear distribution gene E homolog (A. nidulans)-like 1) were used as positive controls in this assay. In addition, GST-dysbindin also interacted directly with FLAG-DISC1 purified by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B). Moreover, reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of dysbindin and DISC1 was detected consistently in transfected HEK293T cell lysates (Fig. 1C), indicating potential protein complex formation in the cellular context. Consistently, DISC1 and dysbindin were coimmunoprecipitated from mouse brain lysates (Fig. 1D). We also examined the subcellular localization of these two proteins using immunocytochemistry in HEK293 cells. Confocal microscopy images showed significant colocalization between Myc-dysbindin and EGFP-DISC1 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results suggest that dysbindin and DISC1 form a physiologically functional complex. We next attempted to identify the protein subregions mediating the interaction between dysbindin and DISC1. A series of deletion mutants of dysbindin were generated on the basis of domain predictions, and their interactions with DISC1 were assayed by coimmunoprecipitation in HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1F, the unstructured N-terminal and coiled-coil domains of dysbindin (residues 1–87 (dysbindin1–87) and 88–180 (dysbindin88–180), respectively) were coimmunoprecipitated with full-length DISC1, whereas the dysbindin C terminus (residues 181–351, dysbindin181–351) was not. Conversely, we also analyzed the interaction of full-length dysbindin with EGFP-tagged fragments of DISC1 (residues 1–350, 345–591, and 586–854). DISC11–350 and DISC1345–591 were both coimmunoprecipitated with full-length dysbindin, whereas DISC1586–854 was not (Fig. 1G). Therefore, the interaction between dysbindin and DISC1 involves a rather broad interface encompassing residues 1–180 of dysbindin and residues 1–591 of DISC1. The reduction of dysbindin protein in schizophrenic patients has been shown previously (23Weickert C.S. Rothmond D.A. Hyde T.M. Kleinman J.E. Straub R.E.

Invest. 2004; 113: 1353-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), implying that the abundance of dysbindin can be associated with the disease. It has been reported recently that TRIM32, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, ubiquitylates dysbindin and facilitates its degradation (40Locke M. Tinsley C.L. Benson M.A. Blake D.J. TRIM32 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for dysbindin.Hum Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 2344-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, some reports hint at the possibility that DISC1 affects the ubiquitylation and stability of multiple DISC1-interacting proteins (39Park Y.U. Jeong J. Lee H. Mun J.Y. Kim J.H. Lee J.S.

Given the role of tyrosine phosphorylation events in different human infections and our previous results showing the activation of the tyrosine kinase Src upon incubation of cells with Listeria monocytogenes, we searched for novel host proteins undergoing tyrosine phosphorylation upon L. monocytogenes infection. We identify the heavy chain of the non-muscle myosin IIA (NMHC-IIA) as being phosphorylated in a specific tyrosine residue in response to L. monocytogenes infection. We characterize this novel post-translational modification event and show that, upon L. monocytogenes infection, Src phosphorylates NMHC-IIA in a previously uncharacterized tyrosine residue (Tyr-158) located in its motor domain near the ATP-binding site. In addition, we found that other intracellular and extracellular bacterial pathogens trigger NMHC-IIA tyrosine phosphorylation. We demonstrate that NMHC-IIA limits intracellular levels of L. monocytogenes, and this is dependent on the phosphorylation of Tyr-158. Our data suggest a novel mechanism of regulation of NMHC-IIA activity relying on the phosphorylation of Tyr-158 by Src.

Listeria monocytogenes is a human intracellular food-borne bacterial pathogen that causes serious disease in immunocompromised individuals. Within the host it finds suitable replication niches in the liver and spleen, disseminates, and then can reach the central nervous system. In pregnant women, L. monocytogenes targets the fetus, eliciting fetal infection and abortions (1.Allerberger F. Wagner M. Listeriosis: a resurgent foodborne infection.Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2010; 16: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The ability of L. monocytogenes to cause disease relies on its capacity to invade nonphagocytic cells, replicate therein, and spread to the entire organism overcoming the intestinal, blood-brain, and fetoplacental barriers (2.Lecuit M. Understanding how Listeria monocytogenes targets and crosses host barriers.Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2005; 11: 430-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Through the expression of bacterial factors, L. monocytogenes establishes a cross-talk with host cells favoring the progression of the cellular infection (3.Camejo A. Carvalho F. Reis O. Leitão E. Sousa S. Cabanes D. The arsenal of virulence factors deployed by Listeria monocytogenes to promote its cell infection cycle.Virulence. 2011; 2: 379-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, L. monocytogenes invasion is mainly driven by the bacterial surface proteins InlA and InlB that bind E-cadherin and c-Met, respectively, at the surface of host cells (4.Mengaud J.

This engagement of host cell receptors triggers tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated signaling, resulting in the local activation of the Arp2/3 complex that initiates actin polymerization at the site of L. monocytogenes attachment (6.Bierne H.

In this study we aimed to identify new cellular proteins undergoing tyrosine phosphorylation in response to L. monocytogenes infection, and we address whether such post-translational modification would regulate cellular infection. The tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were recovered from L. monocytogenes-infected epithelial cells and subjected to mass spectrometry identification.

Although the serine/threonine phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain is a well known mechanism to regulate non-muscle myosin IIA activity (15.Vicente-Manzanares M. Ma X. Adelstein R.S. Horwitz A.R. Non-muscle myosin II takes centre stage in cell adhesion and migration.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 778-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar), our knowledge on the regulation of the heavy chain is limited, and NMHC-IIA tyrosine phosphorylation has never been characterized. Here, we show that NMHC-IIA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to several bacterial pathogens. Our data indicate that upon L. monocytogenes cellular infection NMHC-IIA was phosphorylated in tyrosine residue 158 by the host Src kinase. In the presence of blebbistatin, a chemical inhibitor of myosin II activity, the percentage of cells showing L. monocytogenes-associated actin foci was increased and correlated with higher levels of intracellular L. monocytogenes. In addition, increased numbers of intracellular L. monocytogenes were also found in cells depleted of NMHC-IIA as well as in conditions where NMHC-IIA tyrosine phosphorylation is prevented. These results show the involvement of NMHC-IIA in L. monocytogenes infection and point to the regulatory role of its phosphorylation in tyrosine 158, which could affect NMHC-IIA activity. Our findings describe a novel post-translational modification of NMHC-IIA with important implications in bacterial infection. Taking into account the central role of NMHC-IIA in key cell biology processes, our data also suggest the existence of a new mechanism of NMHC-IIA regulation that could be of critical importance in the canonical functions of non-muscle myosin IIA. Listeria and Escherichia coli strains were grown aerobically at 37 °C, with shaking, in brain-heart infusion and lysogeny broth (LB) media, respectively.

When indicated, cells were treated with 10 μm PP1 or 50 μm Y-27632 30 min before infection. After washing twice with ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% IgePal CA-630 (Sigma), 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Interchim), PhosSTOP, and cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and lysates were recovered after centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Cell lysates (500 μg) were incubated overnight (4 °C) with 1 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 or 5 μg of anti-NMHC-IIA antibodies. Immune complexes were captured with 50 μl of Pure Proteome protein A or G magnetic beads (Millipore). Immunoprecipitated fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and gels were silver-stained using the ProteoSilverTM plus silver staining kit (Sigma) or processed for immunoblotting. For kinase assay, HEK293 cells were harvested and lysed 24 h post-transfection, GFP fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP-conjugated agarose beads (sc-9996 AC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and eluted in 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5. Protein identification was performed by MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry as described (23.Osório H. Reis C.A. Mass spectrometry methods for studying glycosylation in cancer.Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 1007: 301-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Protein bands were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels, reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and in-gel digested with trypsin. Peptides were extracted, desalted, concentrated using Ziptips (Millipore), crystallized onto a MALDI sample plate, and analyzed using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF/TOF (Applied Biosystems). Peptidic mass spectra were acquired in reflector positive mode at a 700–4000 m/z mass window, and proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprint using Mascot software (Matrix Science, UK) integrated in the GPS Explorer software (ABSCIEX) and searched against the SwissProt/UniProt Homo sapiens protein sequence database. The maximum error tolerance was 35 ppm, and up to two missed cleavages were allowed. Bands corresponding to NMHC-IIA, from anti-NMHC-IIA IPs of NI and L. monocytogenes-infected HeLa cells, were processed as described above. Phosphopeptides were selectively enriched by titanium dioxide chromatography (TiO2 Mag-Sepharose, GE Healthcare). MALDI matrix used was 9 mg/ml 2′,4′,6′-trihydroxyacetophenone monohydrate, 5 mg/ml diammonium citrate, in 50:50, v/v, water/acetonitrile. Mass spectra were acquired in a 4800 Plus MALDI TOF/TOF analyzer mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX) both in reflector negative and MS/MS modes. Proteins were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 2.5% skimmed milk in buffer A. Membranes used for anti-phosphotyrosine detection were blocked with Western Blocker solution (Sigma), also used to dilute primary and secondary antibodies. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (15 min), quenched with 20 mm NH4Cl (1 h), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (5 min), and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS (30 min). Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA. Coverslips were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies washed three times in PBS and incubated 45 min with secondary antibodies and phalloidin Alexa 555 or 647. DNA was counterstained with DAPI (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides with Aqua-Poly/Mount (18606, Polysciences). Images were collected with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss Axiovert LSM 510 or Leica SP2 AOBS S.E.) and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. The lentiviral shRNA expression plasmids Mission pLKO.1-puro (control) and Mission shRNA-c-Src (Sigma) were used in combination with the envelope plasmid pMD.G and packaging plasmid pCMVR8.91. Packaging, envelope, and shRNA vector plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. Viral supernatants were harvested after 72 h, filtered, and incubated with target HeLa cells for 48 h at 37 °C. Puromycin was used to select for individual clones. The knockdown was verified by immunoblot and/or real time RT-PCR. HeLa cells seeded in 24- or 6-well plates were transfected with 60 nm control siRNA-D (sc-44232 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or specific siRNAs for NMHC-IIA or NMHC-IIB depletion, using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Assays were performed 48 h later. Sequences of siRNAs are provided in Table 4. For transient protein expression, HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well), 6-well plates (4 × 105 cells/well), or 10-cm dishes (3 × 106 cells/dish) and transfected at 90% confluency with 500 ng, 2.5 μ, or 15 μg of plasmid DNA, respectively, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Assays were performed 24 h later. For rescue assays, HeLa cells were transfected with NMHC-IIA-si#2 and 24 h later transiently transfected with plasmids encoding siRNA-resistant GFP-NMHC-IIA-WT. Kinase assays were performed using the Src assay kit (17-131, Millipore), following the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-GFP-immunoprecipitated fractions from HEK293 cells expressing GFP-NMHC-IIA variants were incubated (10 min, 30 °C) with 10 units of recombinant Src (14–117, Millipore), in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer supplemented with 9 μl of manganese/ATP mixture and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions, including an Src-specific substrate or lacking Src, were used as controls. Reactions were precipitated with 40% TCA and spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper squares, washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid, once with acetone, and transferred to microtubes containing UniverSol liquid scintillation mixture (MP Biomedicals). Incorporation of 32P was determined in a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta TriLux liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as counts/min. Radioactivity measurements were performed in duplicate in two independent assays. Statistical analyses were performed with Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). One-way analysis of variance with post hoc testing analyses were used for pairwise comparison of means from at least three unmatched groups. Two-tailed Student's t test was used to compare means of two samples and one-sample t test to compare with samples arbitrarily fixed to 100. Differences were not considered statistically significant for p value ≥0.05. To identify new host proteins undergoing tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr(P)) in response to L. monocytogenes and that could affect L. monocytogenes cellular infection, we compared the Tyr(P) protein profiles of L. monocytogenes-infected and noninfected (NI) HeLa cells. Cell extracts were collected at different time points post-inoculation and subjected to IP using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (anti-Tyr(P)). IP fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Bands showing variable intensities in L. monocytogenes-infected versus NI cells were excised and processed for mass spectrometry identification. A band corresponding to an ≈250-kDa protein and displaying increased intensity throughout the infection (Fig. 1A) was identified as the human NMHC-IIA (data not shown). To validate this result, HeLa and Caco-2 cells were incubated with L. monocytogenes for different time periods, and the presence of NMHC-IIA in anti-Tyr(P) IP fractions was assessed by immunoblot using NMHC-IIA-specific antibodies. We detected a time-dependent increase of NMHC-IIA in IP fractions from L. monocytogenes-infected cells (Fig. 1B). Levels of NMHC-IIA in Tyr(P) fraction increased 3.5-fold after 60 min of L. monocytogenes incubation with HeLa cells and 15-fold in Caco-2 cells upon 20 min of L. monocytogenes infection (Fig. 1B). Levels of NMHC-IIA in whole cell lysates (WCL) were not affected by infection (Fig. 1B), showing that increased levels of NMHC-IIA in IP samples are not related to an augmentation of NMHC-IIA expression. Incubation of HeLa cells with the nonpathogenic species Listeria innocua for 60 min only induced a small enrichment of NMHC-IIA in the anti-Tyr(P) IP fractions as compared with L. monocytogenes (Fig. 1C). In addition, NMHC-IIA was barely detected in IP fractions from HeLa cells stimulated by E. coli DH5α or latex beads (Fig. 1C). Altogether, these results indicate that the enrichment of NMHC-IIA in the pool of Tyr(P) proteins is associated with the pathogenic features of L. monocytogenes and is not a broad cellular response to any extracellular stimuli. To investigate whether the same response could be induced upon infection with other human bacterial pathogens, HeLa cells were incubated for 4 h with the extracellular pathogenic E. coli EPEC and EHEC or the invasive E. coli K12 expressing the Y. pseudotuberculosis invasin (K12-inv) (24.Isberg R.R. Falkow S. A single genetic locus encoded by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis permits invasion of cultured animal cells by Escherichia coli K-12.Nature. 1985; 317: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), an infection model allowing the study of signaling pathways triggered downstream from the invasin-integrin interaction. As compared with NI conditions, NMHC-IIA appeared slightly increased in anti-Tyr(P) IP fractions from EPEC- and EHEC-infected cells. Strikingly, K12-inv induced a robust enrichment of NMHC-IIA in IP samples that is abolished in cells incubated with bacteria harboring a disrupted invasin-encoding gene (K12-Δinv, Fig. 1D). For comparison, cells were also incubated with L. monocytogenes for 1 and 4 h (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that the enrichment of NMHC-IIA in the pool of Tyr(P) proteins is an event triggered by several human bacterial pathogens. Our data suggest that bacterial infection either induces the direct NMHC-IIA Tyr(P) or stimulates its interaction with a protein that itself undergoes Tyr(P). To address this i"

The single-molecule methods, which provide the size distribution of the aggregates, revealed that Hsp70/40 prevented the formation of large aggregates from small aggregates and that the solubilization of the small aggregates required both Hsp104 and Hsp70/40. We directly visualized the individual association-dissociation dynamics of Hsp104 on immobilized aggregates and found that the lifetimes of the Hsp104-aggregate complex are divided into two groups: short (∼4 s) and long (∼30 s). Hsp70/40 stimulated the association of Hsp104 with aggregates and increased the duration of this association.

Previous biochemical and in vivo imaging analyses revealed that the disaggregase reaction by Hsp104/ClpB-Hsp70/40 occurs in several steps. First, Hsp70/40 bind to aggregated proteins prior to the Hsp104/ClpB action (13.Zietkiewicz S. Krzewska J. Liberek K.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 8513-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Finally, Hsp104/ClpB bind to the aggregates and exert threading activity to reactivate the substrates (1.Tyedmers J. Mogk A. Bukau B. Cellular strategies for controlling protein aggregation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 2.Doyle S.M. Genest O. Wickner S. Protein rescue from aggregates by powerful molecular chaperone machines.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). As described above, extensive efforts over the past decade have elucidated the basic mechanism of Hsp104/ClpB as a molecular machine (1.Tyedmers J. Mogk A. Bukau B. Cellular strategies for controlling protein aggregation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 2.Doyle S.M. Genest O. Wickner S. Protein rescue from aggregates by powerful molecular chaperone machines.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, the process by which Hsp104-Hsp70 solubilizes the substrate aggregates remains poorly understood. For example, because the aggregates are heterogeneous intermolecular assemblies in nature, the ability of conventional biochemical analyses to characterize the heterogeneous substrates are limited. Indeed, conventional methods to detect the Hsp104/ClpB activity have mainly relied on so-called “end point” assays, such as centrifugation analyses, the reactivation of enzymatic activity because of the disaggregation, or electron microscopic observations (e.g. Refs. 7.Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Heat-inactivated proteins are rescued by the DnaK.J-GrpE set and ClpB.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chem. 2005; 280: 23861-23868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Alternatively, previous in vivo imaging using GFP fusions showed “snapshots” of the individual interactions of Hsp104/ClpB with the substrates (15.Winkler J. Tyedmers J. Bukau B. Mogk A. Hsp70 targets Hsp100 chaperones to substrates for protein disaggregation and prion fragmentation.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 198: 387-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 19.Seyffer F. Kummer E.

Biol. 2012; 19: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, so far, no attempts have been made to visualize and analyze the dynamics of the interaction of Hsp104 with the aggregates. To understand the dynamic aspects of the disaggregase reaction in more detail, methods to visualize the heterogeneous aggregates at single-molecule/particle levels must be developed and then extended to analyze the interactions between Hsp104/ClpB and the aggregates. In this report, we describe several methods we developed to visualize and quantitate aggregated proteins at single-molecule levels. These analyses discriminated the size distribution of the heterogeneous aggregates. Moreover, we successfully visualized real-time binding and release events between Hsp104 and the aggregated proteins at a single-molecule level. Statistical analysis revealed the detailed kinetics of the Hsp104-aggregate dynamics, which was influenced by the presence of Ssa1/Ydj1, providing novel insights into the mechanism by which Hsp104 and Hsp70/40 cooperatively function in aggregate solubilization. The purification of Hsp104 and the Hsp104-trap mutant was conducted as described previously, with several modifications (22.Bösl B. Grimminger V. Walter S.

Luciferase was incubated with a 5-fold molar excess of CyTM5 mono-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester dye (GE Healthcare), 5-fold Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes), or 20-fold EZ-LINKTM Sulfo-NHS-LC Biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 90 min. We confirmed that the Cy5-labeled luciferase had a comparable enzymatic activity to that of non-labeled luciferase. Hsp104 was incubated with an equimolar amount of CyTM3 mono-reactive NHS ester dye (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 90 min. Nonreacted dyes were removed by passage through a Micro Bio-SpinTM 6 column (Bio-Rad) and equilibrated with 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. The labeling yield was ∼0.8 Cy3 per Hsp104 monomer. For the single-molecule analysis, the Hsp104 hexamer was prepared by incubating Cy3-Hsp104 and non-labeled Hsp104 at a molar ratio of 1:5. The recovery of aggregated luciferases was performed as described previously, with some modifications (6.Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Hsp104, Hsp70, and Hsp40: a novel chaperone system that rescues previously aggregated proteins.Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Luciferase was denatured by 6 m urea for 30 min at room temperature. To prepare luciferase aggregates, the urea-denatured luciferase was diluted 100-fold into buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 10 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA) containing an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 5 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase for 30 min on ice. For the disaggregation assay, the solution of aggregated luciferase (100 nm in monomer concentration), with or without 1 μm Hsp104, 2 μm Ssa1, and 1 μm Ydj1, was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Aliquots of the solutions were mixed with the luciferase substrate solution (Promega). Luminescence was measured by luminescence PSNTM (ATTO). Cy5-luciferase aggregates were incubated with or without Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1, for 30 min at 30 °C. An aliquot of the mixture was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 1 h, to separate the supernatant and the precipitate. The total fraction and the supernatant fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the band intensities were detected by Cy5 fluorescence, using an FLA7000 bioimager (Fujifilm). The band intensities were measured by the MultiGauge software (Fujifilm), and the ratio of the supernatant to the total fraction was defined as the solubility. Luciferase aggregates were prepared by diluting the urea-denatured luciferase as described above. All DLS measurements were performed at 30 °C with a Zetasizer Nano ZSP system (Malvern). Aliquots of the solution of Cy5-luciferase aggregates, with or without Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1 and 5 mm ATP, were placed on a non-coated glass slide (Matsunami) at 30 °C. The fluorescence images of Cy5-luciferase aggregates were observed on an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX-70, Olympus) with a He-Ne laser (633 nm) and recorded by an electron multiplying charge-coupled device camera iXon897 (Andor Technology) at 100 ms/frame. The fluorescence intensities of the Cy5-luciferase aggregates were measured by ImageJ software. All FCS measurements were performed at 25 °C with an LSM780 microscope (Carl Zeiss) as described previously with some modifications (27.Saito K. Ito E. Takakuwa Y. Tamura M. Kinjo M. In situ observation of mobility and anchoring of PKCβI in plasma membrane.FEBS Lett. 2003; 541: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence was excited at 488 nm by adjusting the acousto-optical tunable filter to 0.5%. All fluorescence autocorrelation functions (FAFs, G(τ)) in aqueous solutions were measured three times for 100 s. The chamber was coated with 3 mg/ml BSA and washed with PBS to prevent the nonspecific absorption of proteins. The solutions of 100 nm Alexa Fluor 488-luciferase aggregates were incubated at 30 °C with or without Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1 and 5 mm ATP and measured. The experimental procedure described previously was performed (28.Taguchi H. Ueno T. Tadakuma H. Yoshida M. Funatsu T.

Cell. 2004; 14: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), with some modifications. A flow cell, shown schematically in Fig. 5A, was made from a glass slide and a coverslip, with double-sided tape acting as a spacer. The experimental procedure for coating the surface of the glass slide with 0.5% biotinylated PEG has been described previously (30.Zhou Z.P. Shimizu Y. Tadakuma H. Taguchi H. Ito K. Ueda T.

Lett. 2009; 38: 308-309Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To immobilize Cy5-luciferase aggregates on the glass surface, 0.1 mg/ml neutravidin was flowed into the cell. After washing, 100 nm biotinylated Cy5-luciferase aggregates, used immediately after preparation by diluting the urea-denatured luciferase as described above, were flowed into the cell and incubated for 5 min. After the excess amounts of the luciferase aggregates were washed out, 100 nm Cy3-Hsp104, 200 nm Ssa1, 100 nm Ydj1, and 5 mm ATP, with the ATP-regenerating system containing the oxygen scavenger system (4.5 mg/ml glucose, 50 unit/ml glucose oxidase, 50 unit/ml catalase, and 10 mm DTT), were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C and flowed into the cell. The Cy5-luciferase aggregates were illuminated with a He-Ne laser (633 nm), and Cy3-Hsp104 was illuminated with a green solid laser (532 nm, Sapphire 532 LP, Coherent). Images were separated by using Dual-View (Optical Insights) and recorded by an iXon897 camera at 100 ms/frame. At least two fields of images were recorded for each assay. The positions of the Cy5-luciferase aggregates and the association times of Cy3-Hsp104 with the Cy5-luciferase aggregates were analyzed by ImageJ software and a homemade program. The plots of the complexes between Hsp104 and the aggregates were fit by using the following equation: C[exp(−kt)]+C′[exp(−k′t)], in which k and k′ are the rate constants of the fast and slow components, respectively. We used firefly luciferase aggregates, prepared by diluting urea-denatured luciferase, as a model substrate for the disaggregation reaction (6.Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Hsp104, Hsp70, and Hsp40: a novel chaperone system that rescues previously aggregated proteins.Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Before conducting the single-molecule experiments, we examined which chaperones were responsible for the reactivation of the luciferase aggregates. As reported previously (e.g. Ref. 6.Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Hsp104, Hsp70, and Hsp40: a novel chaperone system that rescues previously aggregated proteins.Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), the luciferase aggregates were reactivated only in the presence of both Hsp104 and Ssa1/Ydj1 in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). We centrifuged the luciferase aggregates, which were labeled with Cy5, to monitor their aggregation status. The centrifugation assay revealed that substantial fractions of luciferase were soluble in the presence of either Hsp104-Ssa1/Ydj1 or Ssa1/Ydj1 (Fig. 1B), showing that the Hsp70/40 system is sufficient to maintain the solubility of luciferase. The result that Ssa1/Ydj1 maintained the solubility but did not reactivate the protein is consistent with previous data from the bacterial DnaK/DnaJ system (7.Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Heat-inactivated proteins are rescued by the DnaK.J-GrpE set and ClpB.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 32.Zietkiewicz S. Lewandowska A. Stocki P. Liberek K. Hsp70 chaperone machine remodels protein aggregates at the initial step of Hsp70-Hsp100-dependent disaggregation.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7022-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular mechanism for the chaperone-dependent disaggregation, the aggregates were subjected to a detailed characterization. At first, we conducted DLS experiments to characterize the luciferase aggregates. DLS is a particle size analysis method applicable to protein aggregates (33.Panyukov Y. Yudin I. Drachev V. Dobrov E. Kurganov B. The study of amorphous aggregation of tobacco mosaic virus coat protein by dynamic light scattering.Biophys. Chem. 2007; 127: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34.Georgalis Y. Starikov E.B. Hollenbach B. Lurz R. Scherzinger E. Saenger W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Huntingtin aggregation monitored by dynamic light scattering.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6118-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The DLS measurements revealed that the luciferase aggregates at the initial stage had a heterogeneous size distribution (Fig. 2). The hydrostatic radius of the main species was ∼200 nm, and this species accumulated after a 30-min incubation (Fig. 2). Note that the ∼200 nm hydrostatic radius corresponds to ∼9.5 × 105 kDa if the particles are assumed to be spherical. The polydispersities of the aggregates were ∼0.96 at the initial stage, which shifted to ∼0.27 after the 30 min incubation, indicating an apparent reduction of the heterogeneity. Further characterization of chaperone-dependent disaggregation requires the inclusion of chaperones during the DLS measurement. However, the experiment was not straightforward because the inclusion of a stoichiometric amount of the relatively large-sized chaperones, such as the Hsp104 hexamers, perturbed the DLS measurement of the luciferase aggregates. To directly characterize the aggregates, we adopted the HILO illumination method, which illuminates fluorescent molecules by a sharply inclined laser at a low background (Fig. 3A) (35.Tokunaga M. Imamoto N. Sakata-Sogawa K. Highly inclined thin illumination enables clear single-molecule imaging in cells.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Using HILO illumination, we clearly observed visible dot-like fluorescent particles when we immobilized the Cy5-luciferase aggregates. Because there were no such dot-like particles in the buffer containing native luciferase (Fig. 3B), we concluded that the dot-like particles are aggregated forms of Cy5-luciferase. Quantification of the fluorescence intensities of these dot-like particles permitted us to estimate the sizes of the aggregates and to generate histograms of the size distributions (Fig. 3C). The aggregated luciferase was then incubated in the presence of chaperones and ATP. The presence of Hsp104 and ATP did not significantly affect the size distribution of the aggregates (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the addition of either Ssa1/Ydj1 or Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1 drastically changed the size distribution of the aggregates, as detected by the reduction in the number of high fluorescence intensity particles (Fig. 3C), suggesting that Ssa1/Ydj1, regardless of the presence of Hsp104, prevents the accumulation of large-size aggregates. However, the histograms with the addition of Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1 or Ssa1/Ydj1 were distinct from those of native luciferase because of the residual presence of smaller aggregates (Fig. 3C). Because the reactivation of luciferase activity absolutely required Hsp104 in addition to Ssa1/Ydj1 (Fig. 1A), we expected, at first, that the size distributions of the aggregates would be different between Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1 and Ssa1/Ydj1. However, the size distribution of the aggregates under the Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1 conditions was indistinguishable from that under the Ssa1/Ydj1 conditions (Fig. 3C), probably because of a limitation in the dynamic range of the microscopy. Therefore, we took another approach, FCS, to characterize the smaller aggregates that could not be distinguished by HILO microscopy. FCS is a method to analyze the diffusion of fluorescent molecules in a microscopic detection volume (under 1 femtoliter) and, therefore, estimate the diffusion constants, which correlate with the molecular sizes (36.Haustein E. Schwille P. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy: novel variations of an established technique.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2007; 36: 151-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). We first examined native and aggregated forms of Alexa Fluor 488-luciferase by FCS. FCS analysis revealed that the FAF, which correlates with the size distribution, of the Alexa Fluor 488-luciferase aggregates was shifted to the right compared with the FAF of native luciferase (Fig. 4A), confirming that the aggregates are larger than native luciferase in FCS. The aggregates were then incubated in the absence or presence of chaperones, and aliquots of the mixtures were measured by FCS over time. After the 30-min incubation, no reliable FCS data could be obtained under the chaperone-free conditions because of the frequent appearances of spike noises (data not shown), which were too large to analyze by FCS, reflecting further self-association of aggregates, as shown in the DLS analysis (Fig. 2). In contrast, the FAF in the presence of Ssa1/Ydj1 did not change, even after 30 min (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Ssa1/Ydj1 prevented further association of large aggregates, and maintained the size of the aggregates. Strikingly, the presence of Hsp104 in addition to Ssa1/Ydj1 shifted the FAF to the left with time (Fig. 4C), reflecting the size reduction of the aggregates because of their solubilization. The Hsp104/Ssa1/Ydj1-dependent size reduction eventually reached that of native luciferase (Fig. 4C), implying that the solubilized luciferase has enzymatic activity, as shown in Fig. 1A.

The enzymes use ATP to activate lipoate to its adenylate, lipoyl-AMP, which remains tightly bound in the active site. This mixed anhydride is attacked by the ϵ-amino group of a specific lysine present on a highly conserved acceptor protein domain, resulting in the amide-linked coenzyme. The Streptomyces coelicolor genome encodes only a single putative lipoate ligase. However, this protein had only low sequence identity (<25%) to the lipoate ligases of demonstrated activity and appears to be a circularly permuted version of the known lipoate ligase proteins in that the canonical C-terminal domain seems to have been transposed to the N terminus. We tested the activity of this protein both by in vivo complementation of an Escherichia coli ligase-deficient strain and by in vitro assays. Moreover, when the domains were rearranged into a protein that mimicked the arrangement found in the canonical lipoate ligases, the enzyme retained complementation activity. Finally, when the two domains were separated into two proteins, both domain-containing proteins were required for complementation and catalysis of the overall ligase reaction in vitro. However, only the large domain-containing protein was required for transfer of lipoate from the lipoyl-AMP intermediate to the acceptor proteins, whereas both domain-containing proteins were required to form lipoyl-AMP.

Lipoic acid is an essential sulfur-containing cofactor found in eukaryotes, in most bacteria, and in some archaea. It is required for the function of several key enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism (1Perham R.N.

The 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and the glycine cleavage system contain lipoyl domains (LDs) 2The abbreviations used are: LDlipoyl domainACPacyl carrier proteinKEGGKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. that are highly conserved and contain a specific lysine residue to which lipoic acid is attached (2Cronan J.E.

The lipoyl moiety plays a unique role in catalysis. The terminal dithiolane ring becomes reduced and acylated with a reaction intermediate, whereas the lipoyllysine arm serves as a tether and a highly mobile carrier of reaction intermediates between the active sites of these multienzyme complexes (1Perham R.N.

If lipoic acid is available in the environment, LplA catalyzes both the ATP-dependent activation of lipoate to lipoyl-AMP and the subsequent transfer of the activated lipoyl moiety to an apo-LD (e.g. the E2 component of a 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase) with concomitant release of AMP (Fig. 1A) (5Morris T.W.

When exogenous lipoic acid is absent, LipB, an octanoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) transferase, transfers the octanoyl moiety from the fatty acid biosynthetic intermediate octanoyl-ACP to the LD of a lipoate-accepting protein. The octanoylated domains are substrates for sulfur insertion by LipA, a radical S-adenosylmethionine enzyme that replaces single hydrogen atoms on carbons 6 and 8 of octanoate with sulfur atoms (8Cicchillo R.M. Booker S.J. Mechanistic investigations of lipoic acid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli: both sulfur atoms in lipoic acid are contributed by the same lipoyl synthase polypeptide.J. Am. Chem.

Two different bacterial lipoate synthesis pathways have been described: the E. coli LipB-LipA pathway and a more complex pathway in Bacillus subtilis that requires two additional proteins (9Christensen Q.H.

Christensen Q.H. Mansilla M.C. Cronan J.E. de Mendoza D. A novel two-gene requirement for the octanoyltransfer reaction of Bacillus subtilis lipoic acid biosynthesis.Mol. Microbiol. 2011; 80: 335-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and in Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium related to B. subtilis that is auxotrophic for lipoic acid and that encodes two ligases, both of which function in lipoic acid scavenging (12Christensen Q.H.

This laboratory previously predicted that the putative lipoate-protein ligase of this bacterium might have a circularly permuted architecture relative to the well characterized E. coli LplA protein (13Christensen Q.H. Cronan J.E. The Thermoplasma acidophilum LplA-LplB complex defines a new class of bipartite lipoate-protein ligases.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21317-21326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the structurally characterized E. coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae LplA proteins have a large N-terminal domain that contains the lipoic acid-binding site plus a small C-terminal domain (Fig. 1C) (11Fujiwara K. Maita N. Hosaka H. Okamura-Ikeda K. Nakagawa A. Taniguchi H. Global conformational change associated with the two-step reaction catalyzed by Escherichia coli lipoate-protein ligase A.J. Biol.

Another variation is seen in the mammalian lipoyl transferase, which, although sharing 34% sequence identity with E. coli LplA and slightly larger, is unable to synthesize the lipoyl-AMP intermediate. The mammalian protein functions only to transfer the lipoyl moiety from the adenylate to the lipoate protein (14Fujiwara K. Takeuchi S. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y.

A third type of lipoate ligase is found in the thermophile archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum, in which the ligase is composed of two separate proteins, LplA and LplB, encoded by adjacent genes (13Christensen Q.H.

Both LplA and LplB are required for lipoyl-AMP formation, but LplA alone is sufficient for lipoyl transferase activity (13Christensen Q.H. Cronan J.E.

A recent crystal structure shows that the two T. acidophilum proteins interact to form a structure with a domain orientation similar to that of the E. coli protein (18Posner M.G. Upadhyay A. Crennell S.J. Watson A.J. Dorus S. Danson M.J. Bagby S. Post-translational modification in the archaea: structural characterization of multi-enzyme complex lipoylation.Biochem. J. 2013; 449: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Given the low sequence identity to known ligases plus conservation of the E. coli domain arrangement even in an enzyme in which the arrangement is not dictated by covalent bonding, the question arises as to the whether or not the S. coelicolor protein is a functional LplA protein able to catalyze the overall ligase reaction. Moreover, identification of a protein as encoding a lipoate-protein ligase is not straightforward because members of this biotin protein ligase-LplA-LipB protein family (Pfam Clan CL0040) catalyze three other reactions: octanoyl transfer from octanoyl-ACP, amido transfer in B. subtilis, and ligation of biotin to its cognate proteins. We report that the S. coelicolor protein is indeed a fully functional lipoate ligase and that, upon separation of the two domains into two polypeptide chains, the domains of S. coelicolor LplA interact and carry out both the lipoate activation and lipoyl transfer partial reactions.

The LDs of S. coelicolor branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase E2 (KEGG entry SCO3815), S. coelicolor gcvH (KEGG entry SCO5471), and E. coli gcvH (KEGG entry b2904) were amplified by PCR from the corresponding genomic DNAs with primers XC005–XC010. All primers added BspHI and HindIII sites. The products were digested with these restriction enzymes and ligated into NcoI- and HindIII-digested pET28b to give plasmids pXC003–pXC005 (Table 1). Using the same approach, the large and small domains of S. coelicolor were inserted into plasmids pBAD322C and pKK223, respectively, using primers XC015/XC016 and XC017/XC018 to give pXC006 and pXC007. Using primers XC019/XC020 and XC021/XC022, the two domains were also individually inserted into the pET28b vector to obtain pXC008 and pXC009. To obtain the circularly permutated S. coelicolor lplA gene, overlap extension PCR was performed. The large and small domains of S. coelicolor lplA were first amplified by PCR using primers XC024-XC025 and XC016–XC023 (Table 2), respectively. The E. coli lplA linker sequence was added to primers XC023 and XC024 to provide a spacer between the large and small domains of the circularly permutated lplA gene from S. coelicolor. PCR products from the first round of amplification were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). In the second round of PCR amplification, the purified large and small domain PCR products were used as templates, and XC025 and XC016 were used as primers to insert NcoI and HindIII sites. The final PCR product was digested with the same enzymes and inserted into pBAD322C digested with the same enzymes to give pXC010. All plasmids constructed were verified by DNA sequencing. The coding sequences of the wild-type S. coelicolor lplA gene and its small and large domains were inserted into vector pET28b to generate pXC002, pXC008, and pXC009, respectively, to express N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged proteins. Each plasmid was expressed in the E. coli Tuner (BL21) strain. One-liter cell cultures expressing wild-type LplA and the LplA small domain and 4-liter cultures of the LplA large domain were grown at 37 °C in LB broth until A600 = 0.8, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and allowed to grow for another 16 h at 18 °C before harvesting. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) and lysed by French pressure cell treatment. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel chelate resin (Qiagen) and allowed to bind to the resin for >5 h. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) to remove contaminating proteins, and the His-tagged protein was eluted with wash buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra 10- or 3-kDa cutoff) and dialyzed overnight. Protein concentrations were determined at 280 nm using extinction coefficients calculated from the ProtParam program on the ExPASy tool website. Protein purity was monitored by SDS-PAGE. The E2 LD and GcvH (glycine cleavage H) proteins from E. coli and S. coelicolor were purified by precipitation and ion exchange chromatography according to the methods described previously (6Zhao X. Miller J.R. Jiang Y. Marletta M.A. Cronan J.E. Assembly of the covalent linkage between lipoic acid and its cognate enzymes.Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1293-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Plasmids pXC003–pXC005 encoded the native proteins (Table 2). The anion exchange chromatography protocol allowed resolution of the apo and holo forms of the domain as shown on a 20% native polyacrylamide gel. Pure apo-domain was dialyzed, flash-frozen in dry ice, and stored in −80 °C. The purified LDs were submitted to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Mass Spectrometry Laboratory for electrospray mass spectral analysis. The E. coli ΔlipB ΔlplA strain QC146 was used for complementation. To prevent carryover of lipoic acid, all plasmid-carrying strains were grown for 1 day on the same medium containing 0.4% glycerol, appropriate antibiotics, 5 mm acetate, and 5 mm succinate to bypass the lipoic acid-requiring aerobic pathways. Strains were then grown overnight at 37 °C on M9 minimal plates (41Baruah H. Puthenveetil S. Choi Y.A. Shah S. Ting A.Y.

Strains MG1655, QC146, XC001, and XC002 were grown to A600 = 0.8 in 20 ml of LB broth with additional lipoic acid (5 μg/ml) and arabinose (0.2%). Soluble fractions of whole cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Equal amounts of protein were loaded and separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred by electrophoresis to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) for 15 min at 15 V. The membranes were preblocked with TBS buffer (100 mm Tris base and 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk powder. The membranes were probed for 1 h with an anti-lipoyl protein primary antibody (Calbiochem) diluted 1:10,000 in the above buffer. Following incubation with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (diluted 1:5000; Roche Applied Science), the labeled proteins (pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) were detected using Quantity One software. A model of the small domain of S. coelicolor LplA was determined by threading it with the T. acidophilum LplB crystal structure (Protein Data Bank ID 3R07, chain C) using the automated mode of SWISS-MODEL (21Arnold K.

However, the mechanism underlying gastric cancer susceptibility and resistance to YM155 is yet to be specified. Here, we demonstrate that cIAP1 stability dictates resistance to YM155 in human gastric cancer cells. Treatment of human gastric cancer cells with YM155 differentially induced cell death dependent on the stability of cIAP1 as well as survivin. Transfection with cIAP1 expression plasmids decreased cell sensitivity to YM155, whereas knockdown of endogenous cIAP1 using RNA interference enhanced sensitivity to YM155. In addition, double knockdown of survivin and cIAP1 significantly induced cell death in the YM155-resistant cell line, MKN45. We also showed that YM155 induced autoubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of cIAP1. Surprisingly, survivin affected the stability of cIAP1 through binding, contributing to cell sensitivity to YM155. Thus, our findings reveal that YM155 sensitizes human gastric cancer cells to apoptotic cell death by degrading cIAP1, and furthermore, cIAP1 in gastric cancer cells may act as a PD marker for YM155 treatment.

Gastric cancer is a major health problem worldwide. In 2011, ∼989,600 new cases (∼7.8% of all cancers) and 738,000 deaths (∼9.7% of all cancers) occurred worldwide (1Jemal A. Bray F. Center M.M. Ferlay J. Ward E. Forman D. Global cancer statistics.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2011; 61: 69-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (30249) Google Scholar). Asian and South American countries have higher incidence rates of gastric cancer than Western Europe and the United States. Unfortunately, most gastric cancer patients still present at an advanced stage, and, although there have been advances in diagnostic and treatment strategies, the mortality rates remain poor. Conventional therapies, such as radiotherapy, surgery, and chemotherapy, for the treatment of gastric cancer patients can improve survival. However, numerous gastric cancer patients either do not respond to these therapies or relapse after surgery. Targeted therapies have been utilized as a treatment strategy for many solid tumors, including colorectal, breast, lung, and renal cancers (2Custodio A. Méndez M. Provencio M.

Target therapeutic advances in gastric cancer partially increased ORR and OS rates through the inhibition of cell proliferation and angiogenesis and changes to the tumor microenvironment (6Kasper S. Schuler M. Targeted therapies in gastroesophageal cancer.Eur. J. Cancer. 2014; 50: 1247-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, targeted therapies for gastric cancer can be divided into two categories (7Yoong J. Michael M. Leong T. Targeted therapies for gastric cancer: current status.Drugs. 2011; 71: 1367-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar): those that target the epidermal growth factor receptor family and those that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, the survival rate of gastric cancer patients receiving these therapeutic strategies remains poor. YM155, a small imidazolium-based compound, has recently been reported to suppress the expression of survivin through the repression of its promoter activity (8Cho Y.Y. Yao K. Kim H.G. Kang B.S. Zheng D. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Ribosomal S6 kinase 2 is a key regulator in tumor promoter induced cell transformation.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8104-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). YM155 may also suppress survivin expression through disrupting the binding of SP1, a zinc finger transcription factor, to the survivin promoter (9Cheng Q. Ling X. Haller A. Nakahara T. Yamanaka K. Kita A. Koutoku H. Takeuchi M. Brattain M.G. Li F. Suppression of survivin promoter activity by YM155 involves disruption of Sp1-DNA interaction in the survivin core promoter.Int. J. Biochem. Mol.

Ribosomal S6 kinase 2 is a key regulator in tumor promoter induced cell transformation.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 8104-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Until now, many reports have shown the efficacy of YM155 alone and in combinational application against cultured cancer cells, including breast, NSCLC, pancreas, prostate, glioblastoma, and head and neck cancers (8Cho Y.Y.

However, the mechanism relating to SP1 and YM155 in cancer cells has remained unclear. Moreover, the inhibitory mechanism of YM155 targeting survivin on the growth of various cancer cells is yet unclear. In this investigation, the inhibitory mechanisms of YM155 treatment against human gastric cancer cells were studied. We first tested whether YM155-induced apoptosis was associated with inhibition of survivin expression. We next focused on the cIAP1 4The abbreviations used are: cIAP1cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1IAPinhibitor of apoptosis proteinBIRbaculovirus IAP repeatXIAPX-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. change in anti-apoptotic proteins that related to YM155-induced apoptosis.

KATOIII, AGS, MKN1, MKN28, MKN45, MKN74, NCI-N87, and 293T cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). All gastric cancer cells or 293T human embryonic kidney cells were maintained with RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, GIBCO BRL) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO BRL) and 100 μg/ml of penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. YM155, a survivin suppressant, and MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, were purchased from Sigma. Cells were treated with YM155 at the indicated doses for 48 h, and cell death was determined using the trypan blue exclusion method. Cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells for the annexin V staining assay. Then, cells were treated with YM155 at the indicated doses for 48 h. The cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, stained with an annexin V staining solution (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and analyzed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Survivin and cIAP1 cDNAs were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). Survivin T34A, C84A, T34A/C84A, or cIAP1 H588A mutants were mutated using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Intron Biotechnology, Seoul, Republic of Korea). The survivin deletion mutant (ΔBIR) was subcloned into a GFP-tagged pCMV plasmid and the cIAP1 RING deletion mutants (ΔRING) or CARD-RING deletion mutants (ΔCARD-RING) were subcloned into a HA-tagged pcDNA3.1 plasmid. The following sequences were used for siRNA transfection: scramble, 5′-GCGCAUUCCAGCUUACGUAUU; survivin, 5′-UGUAGAGAUGCGGUGGUCVUUUU-3′; and cIAP1, 5′-AACATAGTAGCTTGTTCAGTG-3′. All DNA and siRNA transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total cellular proteins (20 μg/well) were resolved on 8–15% SDS-PAGE gels for Western blot analysis and then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated with the following antibodies: anti-GFP, anti-HA, anti-ubiquitin, anti-GST, anti-His, and anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-survivin, anti-caspase-3, anti-caspase-8, and anti-caspase-9 (Cell Signaling, Beverley, CA); and anti-cIAP1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at 4 °C for 12 h. Primary antibodies were detected using goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized via chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). For the in vivo binding assay, cell lysates (0.5 mg) were incubated with anti-survivin (or GFP) or anti-cIAP1 (or HA) antibodies at 4 °C for 12 h. The mixture was added to protein G Plus-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with Nonidet P-40 RIPA lysis buffer, boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer, and then analyzed with anti-survivin (or GFP) or anti-cIAP1 (or HA) antibodies. Purified His-survivin, GST-cIAP1, and GST proteins were purchased from Abnova (Taipei, Taiwan) for in vitro GST pulldown assays. Briefly, 500 ng of GST or GST-cIAP1 proteins were incubated with 500 ng of His-survivin protein in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 120 mm NaCl) at 30 °C for 1 h, added to GST pulldown buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) to terminate the reaction and then glutathione-Sepharose beads were added (Cell Signaling Technology) for another 1 h at 4 °C. The mixtures were washed five times with GST pulldown buffer and heated with 2× SDS sample buffer. The binding of survivin and cIAP1 was analyzed via Western blotting with anti-His and anti-GST antibodies, respectively. For the in vivo ubiquitination assays, cell lysates were precipitated using anti-cIAP1 or anti-HA antibodies at 4 °C for 12 h and then added to protein G-Sepharose beads for another 2 h. The precipitates were prepared for Western blot analysis using anti-ubiquitin antibody. For the in vitro cIAP1 ubiquitination assay, 500 ng of purified GST-cIAP1 proteins were incubated with 8 ng of human E1, 500 ng of human His-UbcH5a, 2 mm Mg-ATP, and 5 μg of ubiquitin (Boston Biochem Inc., Cambridge, MA) in ubiquitination reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl) and treated with 10 or 20 nm YM155 for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixtures were pulled down using a GST buffer and then analyzed by Western blot assay using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. ProteonTM XPR36 (Bio-Rad) was used to determine the binding of YM155 to cIAP1. GST and GST-cIAP1 proteins were captured on a Proteon GLH sensor chip (Bio-Rad). GST or GST-cIAP1 proteins were captured to 2600 or 7000 response units after immobilization, respectively. YM155 was injected at various concentrations at a flow rate of 100 μl/min for 60 s and allowed to dissociate for an additional 300 s. Native gels were prepared using an 8–15% acrylamide mixture without SDS. Cell lysates (30 μg/well) were loaded onto native gels without heating, and run in Tris glycine electrophoresis buffer (47 mm Tris base, 364 mm glycine) without SDS for 12 h on ice at 30 V. Newly synthesized survivin or cIAP1 protein was labeled using the Click-it metabolic labeling reagents (Invitrogen). Briefly, KATOIII cells were transfected with survivin or cIAP1 expressing plasmids for 48 h and then cells were depleted with methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium for 1 h. The cells were incubated with methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 50 μm l-azidohomoalanine, a methionine analog (Invitrogen), for 4 h. The cells were washed with PBS followed by the addition of complete media. The cells were then chased for the indicated times. l-Azidohomoalanine incorporated protein was biotinylated using the Click-it protein reaction buffer kit (Invitrogen). The biotinylated proteins were precipitated using anti-biotin and then analyzed by Western blotting using anti-survivin or anti-cIAP1 antibodies. All data were statistically analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t test. The significance in the text was verified by p values, and p values <0.05 were deemed significant. It has recently been reported that YM155 inhibits cell growth and proliferation in various tumor cells (15Rauch A. Hennig D. Schäfer C. Wirth M. Marx C. Heinzel T. Schneider G. Krämer O.H. Survivin and YM155: how faithful is the liaison?.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1845: 202-220PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of p53-mutant or -deficient prostate cancer cells with YM155 decreases survivin expression (16Yamauchi T. Nakamura N. Hiramoto M. Yuri M. Yokota H. Naitou M. Takeuchi M. Yamanaka K. Kita A.

Sepantronium bromide (YM155) induces disruption of the ILF3/p54(nrb) complex, which is required for survivin expression.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2012; 425: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In mesothelioma cells, YM155 inhibits MCL-1 expression as well as survivin (17Tang H. Shao H. Yu C. Hou J. Mcl-1 downregulation by YM155 contributes to its synergistic anti-tumor activities with ABT-263.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2011; 82: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, YM155 has an anti-tumor effect on various cancer cells. However, the mechanism that regulates survivin and sensitivity to YM155 in human gastric cancer cells remain largely unexplored. To this aim, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of YM155 on multiple gastric cancer cells (Fig. 1A). The viability of most gastric cancer cells was not affected, with the exception of KATOIII and AGS cells followed by YM155 treatment. To analyze the effect of YM155, two human gastric cancer cell lines with high expression levels of survivin were selected. First, the inhibitory effect of YM155 on these cells was analyzed. Each cell line was treated with different doses of YM155 for different times (Fig. 1). Interestingly, differences in sensitivity to YM155 were observed in the cancer cells (Fig. 1B). Consistently, increased annexin V staining was observed in KATO III cells after exposure to YM155, but not in MKN45 cells (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether the difference in sensitivity to YM155 was a result of different levels of survivin, we analyzed survivin levels after exposure to YM155. The survivin levels in KATO III cells, which were sensitive to YM155, decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner in response to YM155. However, survivin levels in MKN45 cells, which were resistant to YM155, were not changed (Fig. 1D). In addition, YM155 induced the cleavage of pro-caspase-3 to yield active caspase-3 in KATO III cells, but not in MKN45 cells. These results indicate that human gastric cancer cells display differential sensitivities to YM155. Next, we examined the effects of survivin silencing via small interfering RNA (siRNA) on two gastric cancer cell lines, KATO III and MKN45 (Fig. 1E). The knockdown effects of the survivin siRNA on two gastric cancer cells were confirmed. Dead cell populations were dose-dependently increased in KATO III cells after YM155 treatment. However, although the siRNA decreased survivin levels, MKN45 cell death did not increase after exposure to YM155. Consistently, caspase-3 cleavage was significantly induced in KATO III cells, whereas that in MKN45 cells was weakly observed. Moreover, the levels of survivin were clearly decreased in only sensitive AGS cells, whereas survivin levels in the other cells did not decrease (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that YM155 may induce cell death through the regulation of an alternative molecule as well as survivin in human gastric cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 1E, YM155 may target another factor as well as survivin. It was recently reported that YM155 inhibits XIAP in pancreatic cancer cells and cIAP2 in cancer cells (18Na Y.S. Yang S.J. Kim S.M. Jung K.A. Moon J.H. Shin J.S. Yoon D.H. Hong Y.S. Ryu M.H. Lee J.L. Lee J.S. Kim T.W. YM155 induces EGFR suppression in pancreatic cancer cells.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e38625Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To confirm this hypothesis, we initially analyzed the effects of YM155 on XIAP, cIAP1, and 2 other IAP family members. Surprisingly, the levels of cIAP1 protein were significantly decreased in KATO III cells after treatment with YM155, whereas that in MKN45 cells was not decreased (Fig. 2A, i and ii). In addition, XIAP and cIAP2 levels did not change in either cancer cell line, implying that difference in sensitivity to YM155 may relate to cIAP1 as well as survivin. Also, YM155 induced the decrease of cIAP1 expression through protein levels but not mRNA levels (Fig. 2A, iii). Accordingly, we further analyzed the effects of cIAP1 on sensitivity to YM155. Therefore, we first constructed a plasmid expressing HA-tagged cIAP1 cDNA. Transfection with a construct expressing cIAP1 cDNA decreased YM155-induced apoptotic cell death in KATOIII cells but not MKN45 cells (Fig. 2B). Moreover, cIAP1 inhibited the YM155-induced decrease in survivin. In contrast, cIAP1 knockdown via siRNA decreased survivin levels in KATO III cells after exposure to YM155, but not in MKN45 cells (Fig. 2C, i). The dead cell population was also increased in KATO III cells that expressed cIAP1 siRNA (Fig. 2C, ii), indicating that YM155 targets cIAP1 and affects survivin in YM155-sensitive gastric cancer cells. Based on the above data, we analyzed the effects of survivin on sensitivity to YM155 and cIAP1. To this end, we constructed a plasmid expressing GFP-tagged survivin cDNA. Survivin expression inhibited the YM155-induced decrease in cIAP1 protein levels and cell death in KATO III cells but not MKN45 cells (Fig. 2D). Conversely, knockdown of survivin decreased cIAP1 levels, but not in MKN45 cells (Fig. 2E, i). Consistently, cell death was also increased in KATO III cells only (Fig. 2E, ii), suggesting that YM155 induces a decrease of cIAP1 as well as survivin. However, YM155 does not decrease cIAP1 levels in YM155-resistant cells. As shown in FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, YM155 did not decrease survivin or cIAP1 levels in MKN45 cells, which are resistant to YM155. Furthermore, single knockdown of survivin or cIAP1 did not induce cell death or a decrease in protein levels in MKN45 cells. Accordingly, we analyzed the effects of both survivin and cIAP1 siRNA on the YM155-resistant cell line MKN45. Double knockdown of survivin and cIAP1 significantly induced cell death in MKN45 cells (Fig. 3). Our results strongly suggest that sensitivity to YM155 depends on decreased survivin and cIAP1 protein levels in human gastric cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 2, survivin affected the expression of cIAP1 protein. Conversely, cIAP1 affected the expression of survivin protein. Thus, the proteins affected the expression of each other. Expression of survivin inhibited the YM155-induced decrease of cIAP1 protein levels. This result implies that survivin may affect cIAP1 protein stability. To confirm this hypothesis, we have performed the in vivo ubiquitination assays using ubiquitin chain-specific antibodies to analyze the effects of YM155 on survivin ubiquitination. Cells were treated with MG132 followed by YM155 treatment. Cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitated using an anti-survivin antibody. The level of survivin protein clearly increased in response to MG132. Consistently, survivin ubiquitination was also induced (Fig. 4A, i). Also, we analyzed whether the degradation of cIAP1 protein after exposure to YM155 was proteasome dependent using the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Treatment of the YM155-sensitive cell line, KATO III, with MG132 significantly increased cIAP1 protein levels (Fig. 4A, ii), whereas cIAP1 levels in MKN45 cells were not affected by MG132 treatment followed by YM155 (data not shown). Consistent with these data, endogenous cIAP1 was ubiquitinated in response to YM155 in a time-dependent manner such as TNF-α treatment (Fig. 4B, i and ii). We further analyzed the effect of YM155 on cIAP1 ubiquitination through a in vitro ubiquitination assay. Ubiquitination of purified GST-cIAP1 gradually increased after exposure to YM155 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B, iii). We analyzed the interaction between YM155 and cIAP1 for the effect of YM155 on cIAP1 ubiquitination. We performed a surface plasmon resonance assay. A peak of YM155-bound cIAP1 protein was observed by surface plasmon resonance analyses of YM155 that was incubated with purified GST-cIAP1 protein (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that YM155 induces the abrogation of cIAP1 autoinhibition through a direct binding interaction. We next analyzed whether cIAP1 ubiquitination was affected by survivin expression; we transfected KATO III cells with survivin-cDNA. Ectopic expression of survivin did not induce cIAP1 ubiquitination (Fig. 4B, i). Conversely, the knockdown of survivin led to cIAP1 ubiquitination (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that survivin inhibits cIAP1 ubiquitination and its subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. On the basis of these results, we further explored the role of survivin in controlling cIAP1 turnover by treating with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and measuring changes in exogenously expressed survivin protein levels over time. In a cycloheximide-chase experiment, ectopic expression of GFP-tagged survivin did not induce changes in cIAP1 protein levels in KATO III cells, whereas transfection with an empty vector led to diminished cIAP1 protein levels (Fig. 4E). Conversely, knockdown of survivin significantly decreased cIAP1 protein levels (Fig. 4F), indicating that survivin positively controls the protein stability of cIAP1. In view of these data, we also analyzed the effect of cIAP1 expression on survivin protein stability. Ectopic expression of cIAP1 did not decrease survivin protein levels after treatment with cycloheximide, whereas survivin protein levels were significantly decreased in cells expressing the control vector (Fig. 4G). Conversely, survivin protein levels decreased more than control (Fig. 4H). We additionally performed a non-radioactive pulse-chase assay to re-confirm the effects of cIAP1 or survivin overexpression on protein stability. Cells were transfected with either a survivin or cIAP1 construct or empty vector. After the indicated times, cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated using an anti-biotin antibody. The level of cIAP1 or survivin protein was detected via Western blotting using an anti-cIAP1 or survivin antibody. The overexpression of survivin affected the protein stability of cIAP1, and cIAP1 overexpression also affected survivin protein stability (Fig. 4I). These results indicate that survivin and cIAP1 affect the protein stability of each other. Based on the above data, we examined the direct interaction between endogenous cIAP1 and survivin. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analyses revealed both cIAP1-bound survivin and survivin-bound cIAP1 (Fig. 5A, i). To further confirm this, we performed GST pulldown assays. Western blot analyses of purified GST-cIAP1 or GST proteins incubated with purified His-tagged survivin. GST pulldown assays followed by Western blotting detected survivin-bound cIAP1 proteins, but did not detect survivin-bound GST proteins. These results suggest that survivin directly interacts with cIAP1 (Fig. 5A, ii). To further investigate the interaction between cIAP1 and survivin, we constructed HA-tagged cIAP1, GFP-tagged wild-type survivin, and its deleted mutant, δBIR. In 293 cells co-transfected with these plasmids, HA-tagged cIAP1 was detected in GFP-tagged wild-type survivin immunoprecipitates, but not in GFP-tagged BIR-deleted survivin mutant immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5B), indicating that cIAP1 directly interacts with the BIR domain of survivin. Thus, cIAP1 may affect the stability of survivin through interaction with the BIR domain. To confirm this, we first constructed a GFP-tagged survivin T34A mutant (threonine was mutated to alanine in the BIR domain) (19Aspe J.R. Wall N.R. Survivin-T34A: molecular mechanism and therapeutic potential.Onco. Targets Ther. 2010; 3: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar), or C84A mutant (cysteine was mutated to alanine in the BIR domain) (20Li F. Ambrosini G. Chu E.Y. Plescia J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. Control of apoptosis and mitotic spindle checkpoint by survivin.Nature. 1998; 396: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). cIAP1 ubiquitination was induced independently of the expression of each mutant after exposure to YM155 (Fig. 5C). Consistently, cIAP1 directly interacted with wild-type survivin, but not with other mutants (Fig. 5D, i), implying that cIAP1 may bind to specific amino acid resides that are only present in the BIR domain of survivin. These results suggest that cIAP1 affects the stability of survivin through an interaction with the BIR domain. We additionally analyzed the effect both survivin mutants had on stability of the cIAP1 protein. Each survivin mutant also led to a decrease in ectopic cIAP1 protein levels compared with cells transfected with wild-type survivin after exposure to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 5D, ii). Based on the above results, whether survivin point mutants specifically affect cell death in KATOIII cells, which are sensitive to YM155, was examined. Cell death was significantly increased in KATOIII cells but not MKN45 cells expressing T34A, C84A, or both, after exposure to YM155, whereas ectopic expression of wild-type survivin partially inhibited YM155-induced cell death (Fig. 5E), indicating that T34A/C84A, which has a point mutation in the BIR domain of survivin, affects YM155-induced cell death. These results suggest that cIAP1 is stabilized through binding to the BIR domain of survivin and thereby can induce resistance to YM155. As shown in Fig. 5A, cIAP1 also directly interacted with survivin. In view of these data, the interaction of survivin with cIAP1 was further investigated. To this end, we first constructed a plasmid for HA-tagged cIAP1 cDNA and its point mutant, H588A, which is an alanine substitution mutation that is solely present in the RING domain of cIAP1 (21Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Ubiquitin protein ligase activity of IAPs and their degradation in proteasomes in response to apoptotic stimuli.Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In 293 cells co-transfected with these plasmids, HA-tagged cIAP1 wild-type was detected in GFP-tagged survivin immunoprecipitates, but not in HA-tagged cIAP1 H588A immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5F, i), indicating that survivin interacts with the RING domain of cIAP1. We further analyzed the effect of the cIAP1 mutant, H588A, on the stability of survivin protein. Consistent with the two survivin mutants, ectopic expression of the cIAP1 mutant, H588A, resulted in decreased levels of ectopic survivin protein compared with cells treated with wild-type cIAP1. Furthermore, dimerization of the cIAP1 mutant, H588A, was not observed (Fig. 5F, ii and iii). These results suggest that survivin may interact with the RING domain of cIAP1 and subsequently increase its stability. In addition, we analyzed the RING domain of cIAP1 responsible for the interaction with survivin. To this end, we constructed an HA-tagged mutant construct (delta RING cIAP1) lacking the RING domain of cIAP1. Cells were co-transfected with wild-type survivin and HA-tagged wild-type cIAP1 or δRING cIAP1. Wild-type survivin was readily detected via Western blotting following incubation with extracts from cells expressing wild-type cIAP1, but not δRING cIAP1 (Fig. 5G). Thus, the RING domain of cIAP1 is crucial for the interaction with survivin as well as dimerization. Transfection of HA-tagged cIAP1 H588A in KATOIII cells but not MKN45 cells led to cell death after exposure to YM155, unlike in cells expressing wild-type cIAP1 (Fig. 5H), indicating that the stabilization of cIAP1 by survivin affects YM155-induced cell death. Taken together, these results provide evidence that cIAP1 interacts with the BIR domain of survivin, and survivin binds to the RING domain of cIAP1, and these interactions affect gastric cancer cell sensitivity to YM155. Several studies have elucidated the mechanisms by which YM155, a novel small-molecule survivin suppressant, exerts anticancer effects in a variety of human solid tumors (15Rauch A. Hennig D. Schäfer C. Wirth M. Marx C. Heinzel T. Schneider G. Krämer O.H. Survivin and YM155: how faithful is the liaison?.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1845: 202-220PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism underlying human cancer susceptibility to YM155 remains to be fully elucidated. Recently, it was reported that YM155 exerts an antiproliferative effect, inducing cell death through suppression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) in human pancreatic cancer cells (18Na Y.S. Yang S.J. Kim S.M. Jung K.A. Moon J.H. Shin J.S. Yoon D.H. Hong Y.S. Ryu M.H. Lee J.L. Lee J.S. Kim T.W. YM155 induces EGFR suppression in pancreatic cancer cells.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e38625Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, YM155 may be an effective therapeutic agent, showing that its action on other IAP superfamily members as well as survivin. Here, we present evidence that differences in sensitivity to YM155 depend on the protein stability of cIAP1 as well as survivin in human gastric cancer cells. We further showed that their protein stability is interactively controlled through a direct interaction of survivin with cIAP1. Over the past decade, targeted therapy for cancer treatment has progressed. Unfortunately, despite a wide variety of approaches, human gastric cancer remains a major challenge with fewer effective targeted therapies than other cancers. Recently, it was reported that YM155 promotes cisplatin-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer (22Sun X.P. Dong X. Lin L. Jiang X. Wei Z. Zhai B. Sun B. Zhang Q. Wang X. Jiang H. Krissansen G.W. Qiao H. Sun X. Up-regulation of survivin by AKT and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α contributes to cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer.FEBS J. 2014; 281: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our research focused on the inhibitory effect of YM155 alone on gastric cancer. We investigated whether YM155 could induce apoptotic cell death through the down-regulation of cIAP1 protein as well as survivin in human gastric cancer cells, but not mRNA levels (Fig. 2). In addition, decreased levels of XIAP and cIAP2 were not observed (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). On the basis of these results, we focused on a decrease of cIAP1 protein after exposure to YM155. For this, we first analyzed the stability of cIAP1 and survivin with regard to their expression. As shown in Fig. 4, the decrease in the levels of cIAP1 or survivin by YM155 was blocked by the ectopic expression of each protein. Conversely, survivin knockdown led to cIAP1 ubiquitination, suggesting that survivin and cIAP1 each affect the protein stability of the other and subsequently determine cell sensitivity to YM155. We further confirmed the mechanism underlying the degradation of cIAP1 and survivin by YM155. As shown in Fig. 5, cIAP1 directly interacted with the BIR domain of survivin, and survivin bound to the RING domain of cIAP1. We also analyzed the RING or combined RING-CARD on survivin-bound cIAP1. To this end, we first constructed HA-tagged constructs of the RING domain and the RING-CARD domain. We assessed the levels of survivin-bound cIAP1 after co-transfecting 293 cells with GFP-tagged wild-type survivin and HA-tagged wild-type cIAP1, HA-tagged RING, or RING-CARD. The levels of wild-type survivin-bound cIAP1 clearly decreased in the cells transfected with HA-tagged RING or RING-CARD (data not shown). These results suggest that the RING or combined RING-CARD acts as an antagonist to the survivin-cIAP1 interaction. Interactive control of cIAP1 and survivin affects the sensitivity to YM155. However, these interactions were also observed in MKN45 cells, which are resistant to YM155 (Fig. 6A). A survivin heteromer disappeared in KATOIII cells, which are sensitive to YM155, after exposure to YM155, but an increase of the heteromer was observed in MKN45 cells (Fig. 6B). Also, we analyzed the interaction between survivin and the cIAP1 dimer and monomer. We prepared lysates from YM155-treated cells and immunoprecipitated them using an anti-survivin antibody. Immunoprecipitation and native gel analyses revealed that survivin interacts with the monomer of cIAP1. In addition, treatment of YM155 led to a decrease in the cIAP1 monomer in KATOIII cells, but not in MKN45 cells (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that the survivin-cIAP1 complex is regulated by other factors in MKN45. That is, sensitivity to YM155 determine to the presence of other factor regulators for the survivin-cIAP1 complex. Therefore, knockdown of survivin or cIAP1 induces cell death through each others regulation in KATOIII, which is not regulated by other factors for the survivin-cIAP1 complex, but only double knockdown of survivin and cIAP1 induces cell death in MKN45, which is regulated by other factors for the survivin-cIAP1 complex (Fig. 3). The results coincided with data shown in Fig. 2. Next, we analyzed whether cIAP1 or survivin point mutants specifically affect cell death in MKN45 cells. Cell death was not observed in MKN45 cells expressing survivin T34A, C84A, both, or cIAP1 H588A after exposure to YM155, unlike KATOIII cells (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5), implying that there may be another factor that interacts with cIAP1 or/and survivin. Future research will be focused on the detailed mechanisms or unknown molecules that can directly regulate the stability of cIAP1 or/and survivin in human gastric cancer cells that are resistant to YM155. Although we clearly established the important role of cIAP1 as well as survivin for the anti-tumor effects of YM155 in human gastric cancer cells, the regulatory mechanisms of cIAP1 and survivin in YM155-resistant cells were not addressed. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of YM155 for gastric cancer treatment through the degradation of cIAP1 as well as survivin."

TfR2 is primarily expressed in hepatocytes and is hypothesized to sense iron levels in the blood to positively regulate the expression of hepcidin through activation of the BMP signaling pathway. Hepcidin is a peptide hormone that negatively regulates iron egress from cells and thus limits intestinal iron uptake. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid approach using the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 identified CD81 as an interacting protein. CD81 is an abundant tetraspanin in the liver. Co-precipitations of CD81 with different TfR2 constructs demonstrated that both the cytoplasmic and ecto-transmembrane domains of TfR2 interact with CD81. Knockdown of CD81 using siRNA significantly increased TfR2 levels by increasing the half-life of TfR2, indicating that CD81 promotes degradation of TfR2. Previous studies showed that CD81 is targeted for degradation by GRAIL, an ubiquitin E3 ligase. Knockdown of GRAIL in Hep3B-TfR2 cells increased TfR2 levels, consistent with inhibition of CD81 ubiquitination. These results suggest that down-regulation of CD81 by GRAIL targets TfR2 for degradation. Surprisingly, knockdown of CD81 decreased hepcidin expression, implying that the TfR2/CD81 complex is involved in the maintenance of hepcidin mRNA. Moreover, knockdown of CD81 did not affect the stimulation of hepcidin expression by BMP6 but increased both the expression of ID1 and SMAD7, direct targets of BMP signaling pathway, and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, indicating that the CD81 regulates hepcidin expression differently from the BMP and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.

Hepcidin, a master regulator of iron homeostasis, is a peptide hormone predominantly produced by the liver.

In the liver, both HAMP1 and TfR2 are primarily expressed in hepatocytes. TfR2 is proposed to sense iron levels in the blood and positively regulate the expression of hepcidin. Our previous studies using an adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV2/8) to express Tfr2 in hepatocytes of Tfr2-deficient mice demonstrated that Tfr2 expression increases hepcidin expression and reduces hepatic iron overload in the Tfr2-deficient mice (14.Gao J.

However, the mechanism and signaling pathway by which TfR2 regulates hepcidin expression remains to be determined. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of hepcidin expression (15.Guihard S. Clay D. Cocault L. Saulnier N. Opolon P. Souyri M. Pagès G.

It is targeted to the lysosome for degradation through the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway without detectable direct ubiquitination (23.Chen J. Wang J. Meyers K.R. Enns C.A.

In the present study, a yeast two-hybrid assay using the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 as the “bait” and a human liver library as the “prey” was employed to identify proteins that are responsible for its trafficking within the cell. CD81 scored as a binding partner of TfR2. CD81 is a broadly expressed protein and is associated with a wide variety of different biological responses, including cell adhesion, morphology, motility, metastasis, proliferation, differentiation, cell activation, and signal transduction (24.Levy S.

We were interested in CD81 because of its high level of expression in the liver (25.Reynolds G.M. Harris H.J. Jennings A. Hu K. Grove J. Lalor P.F. Adams D.H. Balfe P. Hübscher S.G. McKeating J.A.

The pcDNA3/CD81 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Vinicio Carloni (Department of Internal Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1-Myc (Invitrogen). The pcDNA3-TfR2ΔCD encoding TfR2 lacking its cytoplasmic domain was generated from pcDNA3-TfR2 by PCR. The chimera, TfR2CD/TfR1-f, containing the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 and the transmembrane and ecto-domains of TfR1 followed by a Flag epitope was described previously (21.Chen J. Enns C.A.

Cycloheximide was added into the medium to a final concentration of 150 μg/ml for 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 h. Cells were solubilized, and the lysates were subjected to SDS-10% PAGE. The TfR2 and actin were detected on immunoblots. The integrated intensity of TfR2 was normalized to that of actin, which did not change detectably over the time course of the experiment. The normalized intensity was expressed as a percentage of the intensity at time 0. Half-life was determined by single exponential decay (Prism, GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). The graph shows the mean of 10 experiments; error bars indicate standard deviation. Cells seeded in 35-mm dish for 16 h were transfected with siRNA. After 2 days, they were washed three times with ice-cold PBS+ buffer (PBS with 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2) and incubated with 0.25 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS+ buffer for 30 min on ice. The reaction was quenched by washing the cells five-times with ice-cold PBS buffer containing 0.1% glycine (pH 7.6). Cells were solubilized, and cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. Biotinylated proteins were isolated with streptavidin-agarose and subjected to SDS-10% PAGE followed by immunodetection with anti-TfR2, anti-TfR1, anti-actin, and anti-Flag antibodies. The difference between groups was analyzed by the paired two-tailed Student's t test using Prism (Prism; GraphPad). We wanted to determine the proteins that interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 because this domain often plays roles both in the trafficking of membrane proteins and in signaling. To identify the interacting partners of TfR2, a yeast two-hybrid screen using the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 as the “bait” and a human liver library as the “prey” was used. CD81 was identified to interact with TfR2. To confirm the physical interaction between TfR2 and CD81, CD81-Myc and full-length TfR2 or pcDNA3 empty vector were transiently co-transfected into HEK293 cells, an easy to transfect human cell line often used to detect protein-protein interactions. CD81-Myc was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitate showed that TfR2 co-precipitated with CD81 (Fig. 1A, left panel). No TfR2 was detected in immunoprecipitates of the mock-transfected samples, indicating that TfR2 does not interact with the Myc antibody. To further confirm the interaction between TfR2 and CD81, a reciprocal immunoprecipitation with anti-TfR2 antibody was performed. CD81 could be detected in TfR2 isolates (Fig. 1A, right panel). Unlike TfR2, TfR1 did not interact detectably with CD81 (Fig. 1B), further suggesting that the interaction between CD81 and TfR2 was specific. The interaction between TfR2 and CD81 was tested further. Because TfR1 does not interact with CD81, a chimera containing the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 (TfR2CD) and the transmembrane and ecto-domains of TfR1 with a Flag epitope at the C-terminal (TfR2CD/TfR1-f) was used to confirm the interaction. TfR2CD/TfR1-f and CD81-Myc or empty vector were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells. As predicted from the yeast two-hybrid screen, CD81-Myc interacted with TfR2CD/TfR1-f (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the transmembrane and ecto-domains of TfR2 also interact with CD81, a truncated TfR2 lacking the cytoplasmic domain (TfR2ΔCD) and CD81-Myc were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells. TfR2ΔCD co-precipitated with CD81-Myc (Fig. 1D). Therefore, both the cytoplasmic domain of TfR2 and the transmembrane/ecto-portion of TfR2 interact with CD81. We noticed that increased expression of CD81 resulted in decreased TfR2 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1, A and D) and suspected that CD81 could be playing a role in the degradation of TfR2. TfR2 is degraded in lysosomes without detectable ubiquitination (23.Chen J. Wang J. Meyers K.R. Enns C.A. Transferrin-directed internalization and cycling of transferrin receptor 2.Traffic. 2009; 10: 1488-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but those results did not rule out the possibility that a binding partner of TfR2 could be ubiquitinated. CD81 is ubiquitinated by GRAIL (26.Lineberry N. Su L. Soares L. Fathman C.G. The single subunit transmembrane E3 ligase gene related to anergy in lymphocytes (GRAIL) captures and then ubiquitinates transmembrane proteins across the cell membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28497-28505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To test whether the interaction between CD81 and TfR2 contributed to the down-regulation of TfR2, Hep3B cells were stably transfected with TfR2, TfR2CD/TfR1-f, or TfR2ΔCD. This hepatoma cell line was chosen because it does not express detectable TfR2 but does endogenously express CD81. To test whether CD81 decreased the steady-state level of TfR2, Hep3B-TfR2 cells were transiently transfected with CD81-Myc for 48 h. TfR2 decreased modestly, whereas TfR1 remained the same (Fig. 2A), implying that CD81 was not producing a generalized down-regulation of plasma membrane proteins. Similarly, increased expression of CD81-Myc decreased the levels of TfR2CD/TfR1-f (Fig. 2B) and of TfR2ΔCD (Fig. 2C). Similar to cells expressing TfR2, the level of TfR1 did not change in TfRΔCD-expressing cells. TfR1 level showed a tendency to decline in the TfR2CD/TfR1-f cells, most likely because of the formation of heterodimers between TfR1 and TfR2CD/TfR1-f (Fig. 2B). The ectodomain of TfR1 contains the dimerization motif (30.Lawrence C.M. Ray S. Babyonyshev M. Galluser R. Borhani D.W. Harrison S.C. Crystal structure of the ectodomain of human transferrin receptor.Science. 1999; 286: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Together, the results in FIGURE 1., FIGURE 2. indicate that the level of TfR2 is inversely associated with the expression of CD81. Because increased expression of CD81 decreases the steady-state levels of TfR2, knockdown of CD81 could be expected to increase TfR2 levels. Hep3B-TfR2 cells were transfected with CD81 siRNA to down-regulate endogenous CD81, and TfR2 was detected by immunoblot to test this possibility. TfR2 increased 2.3-fold, whereas TfR1 remained unchanged when CD81 mRNA was decreased by approximately a factor of 2 (Fig. 3A). Similarly, knockdown of CD81 increased TfR2CD/TfR1-f and ΔCDTfR2 (Fig. 3, B and C) when CD81 mRNA decreased by approximately a factor of 2 after treating with CD81 siRNA. A control siRNA (lane C and column C) was used to test for nonspecific siRNA effects in all experiments. Again, the level of TfR1 was higher in the cells expressing TfR2CD/TfR1-f when cells were treated with CD81 siRNA, presumably because of heterodimerization of TfR1 with TfR2CD/TfR1-f. The higher level of TfR2 when CD81 was decreased supports a role for CD81 maintenance of the steady-state level of TfR2. An increase in the steady-state levels of TfR2 could be caused by a decrease of TfR2 degradation. To test whether this were the case, Hep3B-TfR2"
https://openalex.org/W2053883732,"The regulatory particle (RP) of the 26 S proteasome functions in preparing polyubiquitinated substrates for degradation. The lid complex of the RP contains an Rpn8-Rpn11 heterodimer surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped scaffold formed by six proteasome-COP9/CSN-initiation factor (PCI)-containing subunits. The PCI domains are essential for lid assembly, whereas the detailed molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Recent cryo-EM studies at near-atomic resolution provided invaluable information on the RP architecture in different functional states. Nevertheless, atomic resolution structural information on the RP is still limited, and deeper understanding of RP assembly mechanism requires further studies on the structures and interactions of individual subunits or subcomplexes. Herein we report the high-resolution NMR structures of the PCI-containing subunit Rpn9 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The 45-kDa protein contains an all-helical N-terminal domain and a C-terminal PCI domain linked via a semiflexible hinge. The N-terminal domain mediates interaction with the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10, whereas the PCI domain mediates interaction with the neighboring PCI subunit Rpn5. The Rpn9-Rpn5 interface highlights two structural motifs on the winged helix module forming a hydrophobic center surrounded by ionic pairs, which is a common pattern for all PCI-PCI interactions in the lid. The results suggest that divergence in surface composition among different PCI pairs may contribute to the modulation of lid assembly."

Then we used a group of data from Sun Yat-sen University Gastrointestinal Hospital (SYSUGIH) to validate the accuracy of our developed method. The χ2 test, Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank test, COX model, and discriminate analysis were used to analyze the data with SPSS13.0.We found that the LM number and pathological T staging were independent prognostic risk factors. CEA grading, LN status by CT, and T staging by CT were independent risk factors for LM in gastric carcinoma. In addition, we developed the equation Y = -5.0 + X1 + 1.8X3 + 0.7X4 (X1 = CEA grading, X3 = LN status by CT, X4 = T staging by CT) to evaluate the situation of LM. The data from SYSUGIH shows this equation has a better accuracy compared with CT.SLM is an independent risk factor in gastric cancer. And there was no survival difference between the skip metastasis group and the other SLM group (P = 0.659). It is inappropriate for the patient with SLM doing a standard D2 lymphadenectomy, due to the fact that LM rarely occurs in the splenic artery, splenic hilum. The risk factors for LM include CEA grading, LN status by CT, and T staging by CT. And we can use Y = -5.0 + X1 + 1.8X3 + 0.7X4 (X1, CEA grading, X3 = LN status by CT, X4 = T staging by CT, the critical value is 0.3) to estimate the possibility of LM, which has a better accuracy compared with CT."
https://openalex.org/W2019413122,"Reproductive investment is typically considered in terms of size and number of propagules produced. Compared with a thorough understanding of the overall patterns and ecological correlates of avian clutch size, egg size has received less attention and the total effort invested in laying a clutch of eggs is rarely considered. We used clutch volume as an alternative estimate of reproductive investment and present the first class-level analysis of clutch volume in birds using 1,364 randomly-selected species in 204 families. The relationship between body mass and egg volume was very strong (r2 = 0.946), validating previous studies identifying four families (Apterygidae, Pelecanoidiididae, Sternidae and Dromadidiae) with disproportionately large eggs. Clutch volume was also closely related to body mass (r2 = 0.909) and all but one of the taxa with disproportionately large eggs conformed to the overall relationship, their greater egg dimensions compensated by diminished clutch size. The only family which departed significantly from the relationship between body mass and clutch volume was the mound builders (Megapodiidae)—the only group of birds that do not rely on body heat for incubation. Although previously known for laying large clutches of large eggs containing disproportionately large yolks, the remarkable investment of megapodes in reproduction (more than seven times greater than other birds of comparable mass) has been hitherto overlooked. We consider the evolutionary basis and ecological implications of this finding, suggesting that energetic costs associated with incubation act as an upper limit on reproductive output of other birds. We recommend clutch volume as a sensitive, fine-grained measure of reproductive effort for research at a wide range of scales and advocate further analysis of ecological correlates of clutch volume in birds and amniotes generally."
https://openalex.org/W2023149433,"The epithelial-connective tissue interface (ECTI) plays an integral role in epithelial neoplasia, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This interface undergoes significant alterations due to hyperproliferating epithelium that supports the transformation of normal epithelium to precancers and cancer. We present a method based on nonlinear optical microscopy to directly assess the ECTI and quantify dysplastic alterations using a hamster model for oral carcinogenesis. Neoplastic and non-neoplastic normal mucosa were imaged in-vivo by both multiphoton autofluorescence microscopy (MPAM) and second harmonic generation microscopy (SHGM) to obtain cross-sectional reconstructions of the oral epithelium and lamina propria. Imaged sites were biopsied and processed for histopathological grading and measurement of ECTI parameters. An ECTI shape parameter was calculated based on deviation from the linear geometry (ΔLinearity) seen in normal mucosa was measured using MPAM-SHGM and histology. The ECTI was readily visible in MPAM-SHGM and quantitative shape analysis showed ECTI deformation in dysplasia but not in normal mucosa. ΔLinearity was significantly (p < 0.01) higher in dysplasia (0.41±0.24) than normal (0.11±0.04) as measured in MPAM-SHGM and results were confirmed in histology which showed similar trends in ΔLinearity. Increase in ΔLinearity was also statistically significant for different grades of dysplasia. In-vivo ΔLinearity measurement alone from microscopy discriminated dysplasia from normal tissue with 87.9% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity, while calculations from histology provided 96.4% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity. Among other quantifiable architectural changes, a progressive statistically significant increase in epithelial thickness was seen with increasing grade of dysplasia. MPAM-SHGM provides new noninvasive ways for direct characterization of ECTI which may be used in preclinical studies to investigate the role of this interface in early transformation. Further development of the method may also lead to new diagnostic approaches to differentiate non-neoplastic tissue from precancers and neoplasia, possibly with other cellular and layer based indicators of abnormality."
https://openalex.org/W1975795071,"Radio-frequency catheter ablation (RFCA) using Joule heat has two fundamental weaknesses: the limited depth of treatment and the risk of thrombus formation. In contrast, focused shock wave (SW) therapy could damage tissues at arbitrary depths without heat generation. Thus, we aimed to develop a SW catheter ablation (SWCA) system that could compensate for the weaknesses of RFCA therapy.We developed a SWCA system where the SW generated by a Q-switched Holmium: yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser beam was reflected by a reflector attached to 14-Fr catheter tip and then was converged onto the focus. We examined the feasibility of our system on pigs in vivo. When applied using the epicardial approach, the SWCA caused persistent spheroidal lesions with mild superficial injury than the RFCA. The lesions were created to a depth based on the focal length (2.0 mm) [2.36 ± 0.45 (SD) mm immediately after procedure, n = 16]. When applied to the atrioventricular (AV) node using the endocardial approach, the SWCA caused junctional escape rhythms in 2 pigs and AV block in 12 pigs (complete AV block in 9) in acute phase (n = 14). Nine of the 14 pigs survived with pacemakers for the long-term study, and the AV block persisted for 12.6 ± 3.9 (SD) days in all surviving pigs. Histological examination showed AV nodal cell body atrophy in the acute phase and fibrotic lesions in the chronic phase. Importantly, no acute or chronic fatal complications were noted.Our novel SWCA system could be a promising modality as a non-thermal ablation method to compensate for the weaknesses of RFCA therapy. However, further research and development will be necessary as the current prototype still exhibited the presence of micro-thrombus formation in the animal studies."
https://openalex.org/W2006960575,"A monitoring trial was carried out to investigate the effect of boreholes configuration on the stability and gas production rate. These boreholes were drilled from the retaining roadway at longwall mining panel 1111(1) of the Zhuji Coalmine, in China. A borehole camera exploration device and multiple gas parameter measuring device were adopted to monitor the stability and gas production rate. Research results show that boreholes 1~8 with low intensity and thin casing thickness were broken at the depth of 5~10 m along the casing and with a distance of 2~14 m behind the coal face, while boreholes 9~11 with a special thick-walled high-strength oil casing did not fracture during the whole extraction period. The gas extraction volume is closely related to the boreholes stability. After the stability of boreholes 9~11 being improved, the average gas flow rate increased dramatically 16-fold from 0.13 to 2.21 m3/min, and the maximum gas flow rate reached 4.9 m3/min. Strengthening boreholes configuration is demonstrated to be a good option to improve gas extraction effect. These findings can make a significant contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the coal mining industry."

However, the mechanism remains unclear. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and its receptors S1PR2 and S1PR3 are known to play an important role in kidney disease. Here, we tested whether NPKL is able to regulate the S1P pathway in the kidney of IgAN rats. Four groups of rats were included in the study: Control, IgAN, IgAN treated with losartan, and IgAN treated with NPKL. The IgAN model was generated by injection of bovine serum albumin and staphylococcus enterotoxin B. We found that IgAN rats had increased staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the mesangial area and increased mRNA and protein levels of S1PR2 and S1PR3 in the kidney compared to control rats. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a downstream growth factor in the S1P pathway, was also elevated in the kidney of IgAN rats. Treatment with either NPKL or losartan was able to reduce PCNA staining and the expression of both S1PR2 and S1PR3 in the kidney of IgAN rats. However, NPKL (but not losartan treatment) reduced the expression of CTGF in the kidney of IgAN rats. In addition, we treated rat mesangial cells with sera collected from either NPKL-treated rats or control rats and found that NPKL-serum was able to reduce S1P-induced mesangial cell proliferation and the expression of S1PR2/S1PR3 and CTGF. NPKL also attenuates expression of fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress markers in the kidney of IgAN rats. Our studies provide the mechanism by which NPKL attenuates kidney injury in IgAN rats."
https://openalex.org/W2006450971,"Background Clinical studies suggest that short-term insulin treatment in new-onset type 2 diabetes (T2DM) can promote prolonged glycemic control. The purpose of this study was to establish an animal model to examine such a “legacy” effect of early insulin therapy (EIT) in long-term glycemic control in new-onset T2DM. The objective of the study was to investigate the role of diet following onset of diabetes in the favorable outcomes of EIT. Methodology As such, C57BL6/J male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 21 weeks to induce diabetes and then received 4 weeks of daily insulin glargine or sham subcutaneous injections. Subsequently, mice were either kept on the HFD or switched to a low-fat diet (LFD) for 4 additional weeks. Principal Findings Mice fed a HFD gained significant fat mass and displayed increased leptin levels, increasing insulin resistance (poor HOMA-IR) and worse glucose tolerance test (GTT) performance in comparison to mice fed a LFD, as expected. Insulin-treated diabetic mice but maintained on the HFD demonstrated even greater weight gain and insulin resistance compared to sham-treated mice. However, insulin-treated mice switched to the LFD exhibited a better HOMA-IR compared to those mice left on a HFD. Further, between the insulin-treated and sham control mice, in spite of similar HOMA-IR values, the insulin-treated mice switched to a LFD following insulin therapy did demonstrate significantly better HOMA-B% values than sham control and insulin-treated HFD mice. Conclusion/Interpretation Early insulin treatment in HFD-induced T2DM in C57BL6/J mice was only beneficial in animals that were switched to a LFD after insulin treatment which may explain why a similar legacy effect in humans is achieved clinically in only a portion of cases studied, emphasizing a vital role for diet adherence in diabetes control."

https://openalex.org/W1964040053,"A major goal of current signaling research is to develop a quantitative understanding of how receptor activation is coupled to downstream signaling events and to functional cellular responses. Here, we measure how activation of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase on mouse neuroblastoma cells by the neurotrophin artemin (ART) is quantitatively coupled to key downstream effectors. We show that the efficiency of RET coupling to ERK and Akt depends strongly on ART concentration, and it is highest at the low (∼100 pm) ART levels required for neurite outgrowth. Quantitative discrimination between ERK and Akt pathway signaling similarly is highest at this low ART concentration. Stimulation of the cells with 100 pm ART activated RET at the rate of ∼10 molecules/cell/min, leading at 5–10 min to a transient peak of ∼150 phospho-ERK (pERK) molecules and ∼50 pAkt molecules per pRET, after which time the levels of these two signaling effectors fell by 25–50% while the pRET levels continued to slowly rise. Kinetic experiments showed that signaling effectors in different pathways respond to RET activation with different lag times, such that the balance of signal flux among the different pathways evolves over time. Our results illustrate that measurements using high, super-physiological growth factor levels can be misleading about quantitative features of receptor signaling. We propose a quantitative model describing how receptor-effector coupling efficiency links signal amplification to signal sensitization between receptor and effector, thereby providing insight into design principles underlying how receptors and their associated signaling machinery decode an extracellular signal to trigger a functional cellular outcome."
https://openalex.org/W1975118498,"The developing chick optic tectum is a widely used model of corticogenesis and angiogenesis. Cell behaviors involved in corticogenesis and angiogenesis share several regulatory mechanisms. In this way the 3D organizations of both systems adapt to each other. The consensus about the temporally and spatially organized progression of the optic tectum corticogenesis contrasts with the discrepancies about the spatial organization of its vascular bed as a function of the time. In order to find out spatial and temporal correlations between corticogenesis and angiogenesis, several methodological approaches were applied to analyze the dynamic of angiogenesis in the developing chick optic tectum. The present paper shows that a typical sequence of developmental events characterizes the optic tectum angiogenesis. The first phase, formation of the primitive vascular bed, takes place during the early stages of the tectal corticogenesis along which the large efferent neurons appear and begin their early differentiation. The second phase, remodeling and elaboration of the definitive vascular bed, occurs during the increase in complexity associated to the elaboration of the local circuit networks. The present results show that, apart from the well-known influence of the dorsal-ventral and radial axes as reference systems for the spatial organization of optic tectum angiogenesis, the cephalic-caudal axis also exerts a significant asymmetric influence. The term cortico-angiogenesis to describe the entire process is justified by the fact that tight correlations are found between specific corticogenic and angiogenic events and they take place simultaneously at the same position along the cephalic-caudal and radial axes."
