https://openalex.org/W2002598418,"Classical phase transitions occur when a physical system reaches a state below a critical temperature characterized by macroscopic order. Quantum phase transitions occur at absolute zero; they are induced by the change of an external parameter or coupling constant, and are driven by quantum fluctuations. Examples include transitions in quantum Hall systems, localization in Si-MOSFETs (metal oxide silicon field-effect transistors; ref. 4) and the superconductor-insulator transition in two-dimensional systems. Both classical and quantum critical points are governed by a diverging correlation length, although quantum systems possess additional correlations that do not have a classical counterpart. This phenomenon, known as entanglement, is the resource that enables quantum computation and communication. The role of entanglement at a phase transition is not captured by statistical mechanics-a complete classification of the critical many-body state requires the introduction of concepts from quantum information theory. Here we connect the theory of critical phenomena with quantum information by exploring the entangling resources of a system close to its quantum critical point. We demonstrate, for a class of one-dimensional magnetic systems, that entanglement shows scaling behaviour in the vicinity of the transition point."

The decrease inl-Arg levels induces a profound decrease in T cell function through mechanisms that have remained unclear. The data presented here demonstrate that Jurkat T cells cultured in medium withoutl-Arg (l-Arg-free RPMI) have a rapid decrease in the expression of the T cell antigen receptor ζ chain (CD3ζ), the principal signal transduction element in this receptor, and a decrease in T cell proliferation. This phenomenon is completely reversed by the replenishment of l-Arg but not other amino acids. These changes are not caused by cell apoptosis; instead, the diminished expression of CD3ζ protein is paralleled by a decrease in CD3ζ mRNA. This change in CD3ζ mRNA expression is not caused by a decrease in the transcription rate but rather by a significantly shorter CD3ζ mRNA half-life. This mechanism is sensitive to cycloheximide. Therefore, the regulation ofl-Arg concentration in the microenvironment could represent an important mechanism to modulate the expression of CD3ζ and the T cell receptor and consequently of T cell function. l-Arg plays a central role in the normal function of several organ systems including the immune system. l-Arg can be depleted by arginase I produced by macrophages and hepatocytes in several disease states such as trauma and sepsis and following liver transplantation.

The mechanisms mediating the CD3ζ decrease are poorly understood. We tested the effect of the absence of l-Arg on T cell signal transduction. The results show that Jurkat T cells cultured in tissue culture medium without l-Arg had a rapid decrease in the expression of CD3ζ but not of other chains of the TCR such as CD3ε (36Taheri F. Ochoa J.B. Faghiri Z. Culotta K. Park H.J. Lan M.S. Zea A.H. Ochoa A.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 958-965PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of l-Arg did not impair the up-regulation of the IL-2 receptor chains nor the production of IL-2 after antigen stimulation (36Taheri F. Ochoa J.B. Faghiri Z. Culotta K. Park H.J. Lan M.S. Zea A.H. Ochoa A.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 958-965PubMed Google Scholar). This effect was specific tol-Arg, since the depletion of other amino acids such asl-glutamine or l-leucine did not change the expression of CD3ζ (36Taheri F. Ochoa J.B. Faghiri Z. Culotta K. Park H.J. Lan M.S. Zea A.H. Ochoa A.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 958-965PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the work presented here suggests that the CD3ζ down-regulation induced by l-Arg starvation is not caused by apoptosis but rather through post-transcriptional mechanisms that decrease the half-life of the CD3ζ mRNA. This process is completely reversible by the replenishment of l-Arg. Tissue culture medium included complete RPMI 1640 (C-RPMI),1 which contains 1140 μml-Arg (BioWhitaker (Walkersville, MD)), l-Arg-free RPMI, andl-glutamine-free RPMI (l-Gln-free RPMI) (Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 25 mm HEPES (Invitrogen), 4 mml-glutamine (Biowhitaker), and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). RPMI from Invitrogen or RPMI from BioWhitaker showed similar effects in Jurkat CD3ζ expression. Jurkat T cells, a CD4+ cell line (clone E6-1) (ATCC, Manassas, VA), was used to test the role ofl-Arg starvation on CD3ζ expression. Cells were counted and recultured every 2 days to 5 × 105 cells/ml in fresh C-RPMI (Bio Whitaker, Walkersville, MD). In each experiment, CD3ζ was tested by flow cytometry at time 0 (at the time of passage), and its value ranged between 55 and 63 mean fluorescence intensity. The flow cytometry parameters were kept constant, so data could be compared from one experiment to the next. COS-7 L African green monkey kidney cells (Invitrogen) were used for transfection experiments. These cells do not express detectable levels of CD3ζ mRNA or protein before the transfection. Anti-CD3ε−fluorescein isothiocyanate, anti-CD3ζ-phycoerythrin, and anti-APO2.7-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL) were used for flow cytometry. Mouse IgG1-fluorescein isothiocyanate and mouse IgG-phycoerythrin (Beckman-Coulter) were used as isotype controls. Human cDNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (1.6 kb) (CLONTECH) and CD3ζ (1.7 kb) (a kind gift from Dr. Cox Terhorst and Dr. Allan Weissman) were used to detect CD3ζ and GAPDH by Northern blot. Flow cytometry analysis was performed as previously described (36Taheri F. Ochoa J.B. Faghiri Z. Culotta K. Park H.J. Lan M.S. Zea A.H. Ochoa A.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 958-965PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 Jurkat cells were washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and resuspended in 200 μl of DPBS containing 1 μg of anti-CD3ε or isotype control. Cells were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, washed with DPBS, and resuspended in 200 μl of DPBS containing 500 μg/ml of digitonin plus 1 μg of anti-CD3ζ or 1 μg of isotypic control. To detect apoptosis, 1 μg of anti-APO2.7 was added. Cells were incubated for 8 min after which they were washed and resuspended in 400 μl of DPBS. Fluorescence acquisition and analysis were done in a Coulter-EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL) with a 488-nm argon laser. The data are expressed as mean channel fluorescence intensity. 10 million Jurkat cells were used for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted by lysis with TRIzol (Invitrogen) and purified according to the manufacturer's specifications. Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (37Curiel R.E. Garcia C.S. Rottschafer S. Bosco M.C. Espinoza-Delgado I. Blood. 1999; 94: 1782-1789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA from each sample were electrophoresed under denaturing conditions, blotted onto Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Membranes were prehybridized at 42 °C in ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX) and hybridized overnight with 1 × 106 cpm/ml of32P-labeled probe. Human cDNA for GAPDH (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and CD3ζ were labeled by random priming using a RediPrime Kit (Amersham Biosciences) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were washed three times, once at 65 °C for 30 min, using a buffer containing 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS and twice at 65 °C for 30 min in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Membranes were subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C using Eastman Kodak Co. Biomax-MR films and intensifying screens. To test mRNA transcription inhibition, cells were cultured in tissue culture medium containing actinomycin D (Act D) (Sigma) at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) was used to study the role ofde novo proteins in the mRNA stability. To determine the half-life of RNA, the CD3ζ/GAPDH ratio at time 0 was considered as 100% of expression and was used to calculate the half-life of CD3ζ mRNA at all other time points. A densitometer, alphaImager 2000 (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA) was used to analyze the band intensities. All signal intensities were normalized to GAPDH. Nuclear run-on experiments were performed as previously described (38Liu Y. Sun L. Jost J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2718-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei from 50 × 107 cells/sample were isolated by lysing cells in 4 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 150 mm sucrose, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma)) for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40. Nuclei were pelleted again as described above and resuspended in 150 μl of freezing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA). Run-on assays were performed by adding 150 μl of 2× transcription buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm sucrose, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, GTP, CTP) and 100 μCi of 800 Ci/mmol [α-32P]uridine triphosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples were incubated at 29 °C for 30 min. Labeled transcripts were isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as described before and purified according to the manufacturer's specifications. Equal amounts of radioactivity (2 × 106 cpm of labeled RNA) or the same number of nuclei were added in 2 ml of ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion) to Nytran membranes onto which 500 ng of denatured full-length human CD3ζ cDNA and human GAPDH cDNA were immobilized using a slot blot apparatus (Invitrogen) and a UV cross-linker (Fisher). Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 48 h. Filters were washed three times at 42 °C for 15 min with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and twice at 65 °C for 20 min with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Filters were then autoradiographed at −70 °C. Data were normalized for the content of GAPDH present in each sample using an alphaImager 2000 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Coding region CD3ζ cDNA (1.5 kb) was excised from pGEM/ζ and joined by T4 DNA ligase (Promega, Madison, WI) to pCI mammalian expression vector (cytomegalovirus promoter) (Promega), which had been previously linearized with XbaI and EcoRI. COS-7 L African green monkey kidney cells (Invitrogen) were cultured to 90% confluence according to the manufacturer's specifications, after which they were transfected with PCI/CD3ζ or empty vector using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were then cultured and studied for mRNA stability. Briefly, COS-7 L cells were cultured for 48 h, after which 3 × 106 cells were cultured in C-RPMI orl-Arg-free RPMI in presence of Act D (5 μg/ml) for 2, 4, and 8 h. Northern blot was used to study the CD3ζ and GAPDH half-life, as described above. Comparison in CD3ζ expression between Jurkat cells cultured in C-RPMI and l-Arg-free RPMI was done by Student's t test using the Graph Pad statistical program (Graph Pad, San Diego, CA). Jurkat cells cultured in RPMI 1640 without l-Arg (l-Arg-free RPMI) have a rapid decrease in the expression of CD3ζ by 24 h that becomes more pronounced after 48 h (Fig.1A). A careful study of the kinetics of this phenomenon shows a gradual decrease of CD3ζ detectable after 2 h of culture in l-Arg-free RPMI, followed by a plateau of 24 h and a final and more pronounced decrease by 48 h. In contrast, cells cultured in C-RPMI orl-glutamine-free RPMI (l-Gln-free RPMI) do not show changes in the expression of CD3ζ (Fig. 1B). The flow cytometry data was confirmed using Western blots (data not shown). We previously reported that the down-regulation of the CD3ζ induced byl-Arg starvation was specific, since the depletion of other amino acids such as l-glutamine and l-leucine did not change the expression of this protein (36Taheri F. Ochoa J.B. Faghiri Z. Culotta K. Park H.J. Lan M.S. Zea A.H. Ochoa A.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 958-965PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that the absence of l-Arg does not produce a decrease in other TCR proteins such as CD3ε. Furthermore, it does not prevent the up-regulation of other receptors such as the IL-2 receptor nor the production of IL-2 (36Taheri F. Ochoa J.B. Faghiri Z. Culotta K. Park H.J. Lan M.S. Zea A.H. Ochoa A.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 958-965PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in CD3ζ induced by the absence of l-Arg was completely reversed by replenishment of l-Arg (Fig. 2). Jurkat cells cultured in l-Arg-free RPMI for 48 h and transferred to RPMI with 100 μml-Arg recover the CD3ζ expression to normal levels within 24 h. In contrast, cells kept in l-Arg-free RPMI and transferred to freshl-Arg-free RPMI continued to have a decreased expression of CD3ζ (Fig. 2).FIG. 2Replenishment of l-Arg induces the recovery of the CD3ζ expression.Jurkat cells were cultured in l-Arg-free RPMI for 48 h, after which they were washed and cultured in l-Arg-free RPMI plus 100 μml-Arg (♦) orl-Arg-free RPMI (●) for an additional 24 h. Cells were cultured in C-RPMI as control (▪). CD3ζ expression was measured by flow cytometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) An increase in T cell apoptosis has been suggested as one of the mechanisms that could cause a decreased expression of CD3ζ (39Chen X.

However, Jurkat cells cultured in l-Arg free medium did not show an increase in the percentage of APO 2.7-positive cells in the first 72 h of culture, compared with cells cultured in C-RPMI (Table I). Similar results were observed using annexin V and propidium iodide as markers of apoptosis/necrosis (data not shown).Table IPercentage of apoptotic cells in Jurkat cells cultured in the presence or absence of l-Arg0 h24 h48 h72 hC-RPMI2 ± 1.31-aPercentage of Apo 2.7-positive cells ± S.D.4 ± 1.86.3 ± 2.18.2 ± 2.2l-Arg-free RPMI2 ± 1.64.2 ± 1.47.2 ± 2.68.6 ± 1.11-a Percentage of Apo 2.7-positive cells ± S.D. Open table in a new tab We studied the expression of mRNA encoding for CD3ζ as a possible explanation for the decreased expression on CD3ζ protein. As shown in Fig.3A, Jurkat cells cultured inl-Arg-free RPMI for 24 and 48 h showed a marked decrease in CD3ζ mRNA expression (2.3- and 4.2-fold decrease, respectively), compared with control cells cultured in C-RPMI. The kinetics of the phenomena showed a gradual decrease in CD3ζ mRNA expression starting at 4 h of culture in l-Arg-free RPMI, which continued throughout the 48 h of culture (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, cells cultured in C-RPMI had a constant expression of the CD3ζ RNA. We then tested whether the decrease in CD3ζ mRNA caused byl-Arg starvation was due to a decrease in the transcription rate of the CD3ζ mRNA. Run-on experiments were done using the nuclei from Jurkat cells cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of l-Arg. Results consistently showed a lower [α-32P]UTP incorporation (data not shown) and lower transcription rates for both CD3ζ and GAPDH in the nuclei of Jurkat cells cultured in l-Arg-free RPMI (Fig.4A), suggesting a general decrease in RNA synthesis in the absence of l-Arg. However, there were not significant differences in the CD3ζ/GAPDH ratio when compared with cells cultured in C-RPMI (Fig. 4A). In addition, when run-on experiments were normalized based on the amount of radiolabeled RNA (2 × 106 cpm), there were no measurable differences in either CD3ζ or GAPDH mRNA expression in Jurkat cells cultured in C-RPMI and l-Arg-free RPMI (Fig.4B). Therefore, although the absence of l-Arg induced a general decrease in the transcriptional rate, it was not specific for CD3ζ mRNA. The diminished expression of CD3ζ mRNA could also be explained by a decrease in RNA stability. It has been previously reported that the absence of l-Arg induces changes in post-transcriptional mechanisms in yeast (41Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Furthermore,l-Arg starvation induced changes in the expression of genes associated with its own metabolic pathway (41Fafournoux P. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To test whetherl-Arg starvation induced changes in the CD3ζ RNA stability, Jurkat cells were cultured in C-RPMI andl-Arg-free RPMI in the presence of Act D (5 μg/ml), an inhibitor of transcription, followed by measurement of the expression of CD3ζ mRNA at various time points. Jurkat cells cultured in C-RPMI displayed a constant expression of CD3ζ mRNA for at least 8 h. In contrast, cells cultured in l-Arg-free RPMI had a significantly lower CD3ζ mRNA stability (p< 0.0001), which was seen as early as 4 h after culture (Fig.5A). The half-life of CD3ζ mRNA cultured in l-Arg-free RPMI was 3.8 h as compared with 11.2 h of Jurkat cells cultured in C-RPMI (Fig.5B). Therefore, the data suggest that the decreased half-life of CD3ζ mRNA could be induced by post-transcriptional mechanisms. To test this possibility COS-7 L African green monkey kidney cells were transfected with a mammalian expression vector containing the coding region for CD3ζ. The transfected COS-7 L cells were then cultured in C-RPMI or l-Arg-free RPMI and tested for mRNA stability. As shown in Fig. 6, CD3ζ mRNA was detected in COS-7 L cells transfected with the plasmid containing the coding region CD3ζ cDNA (lane 3), but it was not detectable in cells not transfected or transfected with the empty vector (lanes 1 and 2). CD3ζ mRNA expression was similar in transfected COS-7 L cells cultured in presence or absence of l-Arg for 2, 4, and 8 h (lanes 4–9). However, when cells were cultured in the presence of Act D, an inhibitor of transcription, COS-7 L cultured in l-Arg-free RPMI had a decreased CD3ζ mRNA half-life (lanes 13–15) when compared with cells cultured in C-RPMI (lanes 10–12). These results confirm that the absence of l-Arg induces a decrease in CD3ζ mRNA stability by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Because little is known about the mechanisms regulating CD3ζ mRNA under these conditions, we tested whether the decreased in RNA stability was associated with the de novo synthesis of proteins. Jurkat cells were cultured in C-RPMI orl-Arg-free RPMI in the presence of cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor) and Act D. As shown in Fig.7, cells cultured in C-RPMI had a longer CD3ζ mRNA half-life than cells cultured in l-Arg-free RPMI (lanes 2 and 3 versus lanes 4 and 5). There were no differences in CD3ζ mRNA when cycloheximide was added to cells cultured with and without l-Arg (lanes 6–9), since, as previously shown, there were no differences in transcriptional rate. In contrast, when cells were cultured in the presence of Act D and cycloheximide, there was a significant increase in the CD3ζ mRNA level in cells cultured inl-Arg-free RPMI (lanes 4 and 5 versus lanes 12 and 13). This suggests that the decrease in CD3ζ mRNA stability could be associated with the synthesis of a new protein such as a ribonuclease or other protein regulating CD3ζ mRNA stability. Activation of T cells is initiated by the binding of antigen to the αβ chains of the TCR in the context of major histocompatibility complex and the delivery of co-stimulatory signals (42Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). The TCR is a multiple subunit complex made of eight polypeptide subunits including TCRαβ and CD3εγ, -εδ, and -ζζ. CD3ζ generally exists within the TCR·CD3 complex as a disulfide-linked homodimer, which is mostly intracellular and plays a central role in initiating the signal transduction cascade that leads to T-cell activation (25Irving B.A. Weiss A. Cell. 1991; 64: 891-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar,27Weissman A.M. Ross P. Luong E.T. Garcia-Morales P. Jelachich M.L. Biddison W.E. Klausner R.D. Samelson L.E. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3532-3536PubMed Google Scholar). CD3ζ is also the rate-limiting step in the assembly and membrane expression of the TCR (26Minami Y. Weissman A.M. Samelson L.E. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2688-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Regulation of CD3ζ expression is mostly mediated by antigen stimulation (43Valitutti S. Muller S. Salio M. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Binding of antigen to the TCRαβ chains leads to the phosphorylation of the CD3ζ immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs, which starts T cell activation. It also triggers TCR internalization and the subsequent degradation of CD3ζ in lysosomes or proteasomes (43Valitutti S. Muller S. Salio M. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 44Alcover A. Alarcon B. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 325-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23659-23665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). T cell activation eventually leads to the up-regulation of CD3ζ mRNA, resulting in the recovery of CD3ζ expression to normal levels by 24–48 h and an increase in the total number of TCR expressed on the cell membrane (43Valitutti S. Muller S. Salio M. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 46Bronstein-Sitton N. Wang L. Cohen L. Baniyash M. J. Biol.

CD3ζ expression has been found decreased in T cells and NK cells of patients with cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic infectious diseases. The mechanisms that can lead to a down-regulation of CD3ζ include T cell apoptosis (39Chen X. Woiciechowsky A. Raffegerst S. Schendel D. Kolb H.J. Roskrow M. Br. J.

Since recent data suggest that TRAIL can bypass apoptosis resistance caused by Bcl-2, we further investigated the role of Bcl-2 in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here we report that overexpression of Bcl-2 conferred protection against TRAIL in neuroblastoma, glioblastoma or breast carcinoma cell lines. Bcl-2 overexpression reduced TRAIL-induced cleavage of caspase-8 and Bid indicating that caspase-8 was activated upstream and also downstream of mitochondria in a feedback amplification loop. Importantly, Bcl-2 blocked cleavage of caspases-9, -7 and -3 into active subunits and cleavage of the caspase substrates DFF45 or PARP. Also, Bcl-2 blocked cleavage of XIAP and overexpression of XIAP conferred resistance against TRAIL indicating that apoptosis was also amplified through a feedforward loop between caspases and XIAP. In contrast, in SKW lymphoblastoid cells, TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-8 directly translated into full activation of caspases, cleavage of XIAP, DFF45 or PARP and apoptosis independent of Bcl-2 overexpression, although Bcl-2 similarly inhibited loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c, AIF and Smac from mitochondria in all cell types. By demonstrating a cell type dependent regulation of the TRAIL signaling pathway at different level, e.g. by Bcl-2 and by XIAP, these findings may have important clinical implication. Thus, strategies targeting the molecular basis of resistance towards TRAIL may be necessary in some tumors for cancer therapy with TRAIL."

https://openalex.org/W2032259240,"A change in 'symmetry' is often observed when matter undergoes a phase transition-the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken. The transition made by underdoped high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors is unusual, in that it is not a mean-field transition as seen in other superconductors. Rather, there is a region in the phase diagram above the superconducting transition temperature Tc (where phase coherence and superconductivity begin) but below a characteristic temperature T* where a 'pseudogap' appears in the spectrum of electronic excitations. It is therefore important to establish if T* is just a cross-over temperature arising from fluctuations in the order parameter that will establish superconductivity at Tc (refs 3, 4), or if it marks a phase transition where symmetry is spontaneously broken. Here we report that, for a material in the pseudogap state, left-circularly polarized photons give a different photocurrent from right-circularly polarized photons. This shows that time-reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken below T*, which therefore corresponds to a phase transition."

The pSRα1-Flag-hSNF5, pGEX4T-1, and pCDNA3 version of hSNF5 and their derivatives were engineered by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the appropriate primers. pM-c-Myc-(1–262), pM-p53, pGEX4T-1/p53, and pM-p53-(1–83) were cloned using PCR with appropriate primers. The anti-hSNF5 antibody (sc-9751) and anti-p53 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and BD Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Anti-BRG-1 antibody was obtained from Dr. H. Kwon. Anti-BAF155 and anti-SRG3 antibodies were obtained from Dr. Rho H. Seong.Glutathione S-transferase (GST)1 Pull-down AssaysRadiolabled in vitro translated proteins were incubated with GST fusion protein in T buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After glutathione-Sepharose beads were added, this mixture was incubated on a rotating machine (Nutator, Becton-Dickinson) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed four times with T buffer, then 5 × loading dye (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 14.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% bromphenol blue) was added, and the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE.Immunoprecipitation and Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation293T cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described (22Pugh B.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 37: 349-357PubMed Google Scholar). Glycerol gradient sedimentation was carried out according to Tanese (23Tanese N. Methods. 1997; 12: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 293T nuclear extract (∼2 mg) was applied to a 10-ml 10–30% glycerol gradient. Samples were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Twenty 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the top (F1) to the bottom (F20) of each gradient. Proteins in odd-numbered fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and separated by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitations, even-numbered fractions (F2-F6, and F12-F16) were used to immunoprecipitate proteins with anti-HA antibodies.Cell Culture and Luciferase AssaysThe human embryonic kidney cell line 293T, human oestoblastoma Saos-2, U2OS, and human cervical carcinoma C33A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Media was prepared according to standard methods. Yeast strain FY22 and its isogenic mutant strains Δsnf2 (FY1360) and Δsnf5 (FY1658) were transformed using the LiAc/polyethylene glycol method (25Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Galactosidase activity was determined in triplicate from the pools of three independent transformed colonies.Cell Growth Suppression and Apoptosis AssayCells (1 × 105 cells per well) were plated in each well of a 6-well tissue plate and transfected with pCDNA3 constructs by using calcium phosphate precipitation. G418 (500 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium 48 h after transfection. The cells were incubated for 14–21 days, fixed with 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol for 15 min, and stained with 0.4% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 15 min to visualize colonies. Apoptosis assays were done using Saos-2 cells. We co-transfected Saos-2 cells with expression vectors encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein and control vectors using GenePorter2 (Gene Therapy Systems). After 48 h, cells were collected and analyzed by FACScan flow cytometry.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) AssayChIP assays were performed essentially as described in the Upstate Biotechnology protocol. Briefly, a 10-cm dish of 50% confluent 293T cells was transfected with 2 μg of pFR-Luc reporter plasmid and 4 μg of pM or pM-p53-(1–83) plasmid. For ChIP of the endogenous p21WAF1promoter region and β-actin promoter region, we transfected 4 μg of pCDNA3-HA-p53 into Saos-2 or 293T cells.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we showed that p53 interacts with BRG-1 and hSNF5 and that the activation domain-mediated targeting of the components of the SWI/SNF complex to promoters activates p53-dependent transcription in vivo. Activation domain from Gal4, Gcn4, Swi5, GR, and HSF1 interacts with the SWI/SNF complex, suggesting that the activation domain-mediated targeting of the complex to the nucleosome is an important step in SWI/SNF transcription activation (27Wallberg A.E.

Our study is consistent with these findings. However, several groups reported that different domains from the activation domain of activators recruits the SWI/SNF complex. For example, zinc finger DNA-binding domain of EKLF interacts with the SWI/SNF in vitro (35Kadam S. McAlpine G.S. Phelan M.L. Kingston R.E. Jones K.A. Emerson B.M.

The absence of a properly formed SWI/SNF complex can contribute to tumorigenicity either by the lack of proper expression of tumor suppressors or by the disruption of the required interaction with tumor suppressors such as Rb and p53. In addition, the SWI/SNF complex can contribute to cancer formation by interacting with several oncogenes produced by chromosomal translocation, such as human synovial sarcoma-associated chimeric protein SYT-SSX (39Nagai M. Tanaka S. Tsuda M. Endo S. Kato H. Sonobe H. Minami A. Hiraga H. Nishihara H. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3843-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). SYT-SSX1 required chromatin remodeling factor hBRM/hSNF2 for establishing anchorage-independent cell growth. What role does BRG-1 complex play in p53-mediated cell death? We think p53 utilizes SWI/SNF complex not only for the transactivation of genes for cell growth arrest but also for transrepression of genes critical for cell survival. p53 binds to mammalian Sin3 (mSin3A) complex, a histone deacetylase complex, and deregulation of histone deacetylase activity by trichostatin A inhibits p53-induced apoptosis (40Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The hBrm complex and one of the BRG-1 complexes also contain components of the mSin3 complex (41Sif S. Saurin A.J. Imbalzano A.N. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 603-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 42Muchardt C. Bourachot B. Reyes J.C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the SWI/SNF complex interacts functionally with p53 and that the candidate roles of BRG-1 complex as a tumor suppressor are originated from the molecular connection with tumor suppressor p53 and/or pRb. Our data indicate, therefore, that the SWI/SNF complex functionally interacts with p53 and is necessary for p53-mediated transactivation function. hBrm, a mammalian homolog ofDrosophila brm, is involved in growth control (43Reyes J.C. Barra J. Muchardt C. Camus A. Babinet C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6979-6991Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 44DeCristofaro M.F. Betz B.L. Wang W. Weissman B.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7559-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because p53 has an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, it may be one of the targets for the SWI/SNF complex in mediating its cellular functions. Thus, like other tumor suppressors, SWI/SNF may contribute to a wide range of human cancers including smooth muscle cancer (44DeCristofaro M.F. Betz B.L. Wang W. Weissman B.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7559-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) through binding to p53. As chromatin-associated factors and cellular transformation are related, protein-protein interaction between p53 and the SWI/SNF complex may be significant for understanding the deregulation mechanism of p53 in the tumor cell or tumor virus-infected cells. The p53 gene is frequently found to be mutated in human tumors (1Levine A.J. Momand J. Finlay C.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3642) Google Scholar). This suggests that p53 is important for the regulation of normal cell growth. Wild type p53 has been shown to activate transcription from specific DNA sequence elements both in vitro andin vivo (2Farmer G. Bargonetti J. Zhu H. Friedman P. Prywes R. Prives C.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of p53 strongly activates, through consensus sequence p53-binding sites, a number of genes that have been implicated as functional targets in p53-induced cell growth suppression and apoptosis. These include GADD45 (4Kastan M.B. Zhan Q., El- Deiry W.S. Carrier F. Jacks T. Walsh W.V. Plunkett B.S. Vogelstein B.

In p53-regulated genes, where the protein product negatively regulates cell cycle progression, nucleosome disruption, and chromatin remodeling may be required as a part of the transcriptional control mechanism. Chromatin structure may be one of mediators that regulate p53 recognition of binding sites during the course of the cell cycle and therefore chromatin structure acts as a modulator of p53 driven gene expression. A series of genetic and biochemical studies in yeast showed that multisubunit complexes such as SWI/SNF are able to alter chromatin structure and 11 of the proteins in the SWI/SNF complex, SNF2/SWI2, SWI1, SNF5, SWI13, SWP73/SNF12, SWP61/Arp7, SWP59/Arp9, SWP29/TAFII30, SNF11, and SNF6, might function by altering chromatin structure (reviewed in Refs. 9Vignali M.

Given these previous findings and the hypothesis that chromatin structure affects p53 function, we speculate that SWI/SNF complex and p53 interacts physically and that this interaction contributes to p53-mediated transcriptional activation and cell growth suppression. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Antibodies—pBJ5-BRG-1 and pBJ5-BRG-1(K798R) were gifts from Dr. G. Crabtree. pG13-Luc and p21WAF1-Luc were kind gifts from Dr. B. Vogelstein and Dr. W. El-Deiry, respectively. pFR-Luc and pM were purchased from Stratagene and CLONTECH, respectively. pCDNA3-hSNF5 was described elsewhere (21Lee D. Sohn H. Kalpana G.V. Choe J. Nature. 1999; 399: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). The pSRα1-Flag-hSNF5, pGEX4T-1, and pCDNA3 version of hSNF5 and their derivatives were engineered by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the appropriate primers. pM-c-Myc-(1–262), pM-p53, pGEX4T-1/p53, and pM-p53-(1–83) were cloned using PCR with appropriate primers. The anti-hSNF5 antibody (sc-9751) and anti-p53 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and BD Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Anti-BRG-1 antibody was obtained from Dr. H. Kwon. Anti-BAF155 and anti-SRG3 antibodies were obtained from Dr. Rho H. Seong.Glutathione S-transferase (GST)1 Pull-down AssaysRadiolabled in vitro translated proteins were incubated with GST fusion protein in T buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After glutathione-Sepharose beads were added, this mixture was incubated on a rotating machine (Nutator, Becton-Dickinson) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed four times with T buffer, then 5 × loading dye (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 14.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% bromphenol blue) was added, and the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE.Immunoprecipitation and Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation293T cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described (22Pugh B.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 37: 349-357PubMed Google Scholar). Glycerol gradient sedimentation was carried out according to Tanese (23Tanese N. Methods. 1997; 12: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 293T nuclear extract (∼2 mg) was applied to a 10-ml 10–30% glycerol gradient. Samples were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Twenty 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the top (F1) to the bottom (F20) of each gradient. Proteins in odd-numbered fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and separated by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitations, even-numbered fractions (F2-F6, and F12-F16) were used to immunoprecipitate proteins with anti-HA antibodies.Cell Culture and Luciferase AssaysThe human embryonic kidney cell line 293T, human oestoblastoma Saos-2, U2OS, and human cervical carcinoma C33A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Reporter assays were performed as previously described (24Seo T. Park J. Lee D. Hwang S.G. Choe J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6193-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using the manufacturer's instructions. We included pcDNA3-β-gal expression vector in each transfection. We checked transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase assay and the Western blot.Yeast Strains, Yeast Transformation, and Galactosidase AssayThe following yeast strains were gifts from Dr. Fred Winston: FY22 (MATa his3Δ200 ura3–52), FY1360 (MATa his3Δ200 ura3–52, leu2Δl lys2–173R2 snf2Δ:LEU2), and FY1658 (MATa his3Δ200 ura3–52 lys2–128δ snf5Δ2). Media was prepared according to standard methods. Yeast strain FY22 and its isogenic mutant strains Δsnf2 (FY1360) and Δsnf5 (FY1658) were transformed using the LiAc/polyethylene glycol method (25Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Galactosidase activity was determined in triplicate from the pools of three independent transformed colonies.Cell Growth Suppression and Apoptosis AssayCells (1 × 105 cells per well) were plated in each well of a 6-well tissue plate and transfected with pCDNA3 constructs by using calcium phosphate precipitation. G418 (500 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium 48 h after transfection. The cells were incubated for 14–21 days, fixed with 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol for 15 min, and stained with 0.4% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 15 min to visualize colonies. Apoptosis assays were done using Saos-2 cells. We co-transfected Saos-2 cells with expression vectors encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein and control vectors using GenePorter2 (Gene Therapy Systems). After 48 h, cells were collected and analyzed by FACScan flow cytometry.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) AssayChIP assays were performed essentially as described in the Upstate Biotechnology protocol. Briefly, a 10-cm dish of 50% confluent 293T cells was transfected with 2 μg of pFR-Luc reporter plasmid and 4 μg of pM or pM-p53-(1–83) plasmid. For ChIP of the endogenous p21WAF1promoter region and β-actin promoter region, we transfected 4 μg of pCDNA3-HA-p53 into Saos-2 or 293T cells.

We did not detect any interaction between the p53 core domain and CP-31398 in vitro by a wide range of quantitative biophysical techniques over a wide range of conditions. CP-31398 did not stabilize p53 in our experiments. However, we found that CP-31398 intercalated with DNA and also altered and destabilized the DNA-p53 core domain complex. We analysed by NMR TROSY the interaction of the domain with a DNA oligomer and identified the changes in the complex on the binding of CP-31398. CP-31398 also decreased sequence-specific DNA binding of wild-type p53 and His-273 mutant p53. CP-31398 had a non-specific toxic effect independent of mutant p53 expression in several cell lines carrying Tet-regulated mutant p53. CP-31398 caused a small increase in MDM-2 expression and a more pronounced p53-independent increase in Bax expression. CP-31398 did, however, induce the PAb1620 epitope (characteristic of native p53) in cells expressing His-175 mutant p53. This was prevented by cycloheximide, suggesting that any stabilizing action of CP-31398 would have to be on newly synthesized p53. One of the unstable mutants that was reported to have been rescued by CP-31398, R249S, does not bind DNA when folded at lower temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2330398072,"One isoform of the 14-3-3 family, 14-3-3sigma, plays a crucial role in the G2 checkpoint by sequestering Cdc2-cyclinB1 in the cytoplasm, and the expression of 14-3-3sigma is frequently lost in breast cancers. This loss of expression is thought to cause a G2 checkpoint defect, resulting in chromosomal aberrations. Since lung cancers frequently carry numerous chromosomal aberrations, we examined the DNA methylation status and expression level of the 14-3-3sigma gene in 37 lung cancer cell lines and 30 primary lung tumor specimens. We found that small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines frequently showed DNA hypermethylation (9 of 13 lines, 69%), and subsequent silencing of the 14-3-3sigma gene. Among non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), large cell lung cancer cell lines showed frequent hypermethylation and silencing of 14-3-3sigma (4 or 7 lines, 57%). In contrast, in other NSCLC cell lines, hypermethylation occurred very rarely (1 of 17 lines, 6%). All eight primary SCLC specimens examined also showed a loss or significant reduction in 14-3-3sigma expression in vivo, while a loss or reduction of 14-3-3sigma expression was very rare in primary NSCLC specimens (1 of 22 tissues, 5%). This is the first description that indicates lung cancers frequently show significant inactivation of the 14-3-3sigma gene mainly due to DNA hypermethylation in SCLC, but rarely in NSCLC, suggesting involvement of the 14-3-3sigma gene in lung tumorigenesis in a histological type-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1978116541,"Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) induces scattering and morphogenesis of epithelial cells through the activation of the MET tyrosine kinase receptor. Although the activated MET receptor recruits a number of signaling proteins, little is known of the downstream signaling pathways activated by HGF/SF. In this study, we wished to examine the signaling pathway leading to activation of the ETS1 transcription factor. Using in vitro and in vivo kinase assays, we found that HGF/SF activates the ERK1 MAP kinase, leading to the phosphorylation of the threonine 38 residue of ETS1 within a putative MAP kinase phosphorylation site (PLLT38P). This threonine residue was neither phosphorylated by JNK1, nor by p38 MAP kinases and was required for the induction of transcriptional activity of ETS1 by HGF/SF. Using kinase and transcription assays, we further demonstrated that phosphorylation and activation of ETS1 occurs downstream of a RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. The functional involvement of this pathway in HGF/SF action was demonstrated using U0126, a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK, which blocked phosphorylation and activation of ETS1, RAS-dependent transcriptional responses, cell scattering and morphogenesis. These data demonstrated that ETS1 is a downstream target of HGF/SF acting through a RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway and provides a signaling pathway leading to the regulation of gene expression by HGF/SF."

https://openalex.org/W2018045749,"The serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 acts downstream of Ras in the MAPK pathway leading to ERK activation in response to mitogens. Raf-1 has oncogenic potential, but is normally controlled by a complex interplay of inhibitory and activating mechanisms. Although Raf-1 is phosphorylated in unstimulated cells, mitogens cause its membrane recruitment by Ras and subsequent phosphorylation on additional sites. Some of these events modulate Raf-1 kinase activity while others determine interactions with other proteins. These changes regulate the ability of Raf-1 to phosphorylate its downstream targets MEK1 and MEK2. Rho family small G proteins act synergistically with Raf-1 to stimulate the ERK pathway by a cross-cascade mechanism that enhances MEK phosphorylation by Raf-1. Here we show that both Raf-1 and MEK1 are phosphorylated by PAK1 and that mutations at PAK1 phosphorylation sites in either protein prevent cross-cascade activation. In contrast, MEK1 activation by constitutively-active Raf-1 is refractory to mutations at PAK1 phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of MEK1 on serine 298 does not appear to regulate the interaction between Raf-1 and MEK1, but rather the ability of Raf-1 to phosphorylate MEK1 with which it is complexed in vivo. Our findings indicate that PAK1 primes MEK1 for activation by Raf-1 and imply another level of regulation in the ERK cascade."

Aberrant hypermethylation was observed in seven of 37 primary lung cancer cases. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored expression of the CHFR gene in lung cancer cell lines exhibiting aberrant hypermethylation and loss of its expression. In contrast, genetic alterations were found to be infrequent in lung cancers.

https://openalex.org/W2106038557,"Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma by the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of antidiabetic drugs elicits growth inhibition in a variety of malignant tumors. We clarified the effects of TZDs on growth of human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells that express endogenous PPAR-gamma. Troglitazone and pioglitazone caused inhibition of cellular growth and induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Subtraction cloning analysis identified that troglitazone stimulated expression of the growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible (GADD)153 gene, and the increased expression of GADD153 mRNA was also confirmed by an array analysis of the 160 apoptosis-related genes. Western blot analysis revealed that troglitazone also increased GADD153 protein levels in a time-dependent manner. Troglitazone did not stimulate GADD153 mRNA levels in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells lacking PPAR-gamma expression, whereas its induction was clearly observed in differentiated adipocytes expressing PPAR-gamma. Activity of the GADD153 promoter occurred in a NSCLC cell line in transient transcription assays and was significantly stimulated by troglitazone, although binding of PPAR/retinoid X receptor heterodimer was not detected in the promoter region in gel retardation assays. Inhibition of GADD153 gene expression by an antisense phosphorothionate oligonucleotide attenuated the troglitazone-induced growth inhibition. These findings collectively indicated that activation of PPAR-gamma by TZDs could cause growth inhibition and apoptosis of NSCLC cells and that GADD153 might be a candidate factor implicated in these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2013330018,"The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are activated by a variety of stress inducing agents and are thought to regulate apoptosis in a cell type and signal-specific manner. We have used fibroblasts lacking JNK1 or JNK2 to define their roles in response to different stress signals. Lack of JNK1 results in reduced c-Jun phosphorylation and resistance to UV-induced cell death. JNK2 deficient cells show increased sensitivity to UV irradiation which correlates with elevated and sustained phosphorylation of JNK1 and c-Jun. On the contrary, both Jnk1-/- and Jnk2-/- cells were more sensitive to tumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF-alpha) and sorbitol-induced cell death. Treatment of Jnk1-/- cells with these reagents resulted in reduced JNK activity and a concomitant reduction of c-Jun phosphorylation, suggesting that phosphorylation of c-Jun does not influence TNF-alpha and sorbitol-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts. Moreover, both JNK1 and JNK2 appear to negatively regulate apoptosis independent of c-Jun phosphorylation. These data provide genetic evidence that although the JNK pathway is activated by a plethora of signals, it is required only for the induction of UV-induced cell death in a c-Jun phosphorylation-dependent manner, but not for TNF-alpha and sorbitol-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2049462217,"NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a CNC/b-zip protein that regulates antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated expression, and antioxidant induction, of detoxifying enzyme genes, including NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1). A comparison of Nrf2 from different species, and with other b-zip proteins, revealed the presence of a highly conserved cysteine residue at position 506 in the DNA binding domain of Nrf2. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to mutate this cysteine to serine. Transfection/over expression experiments in human hepatoblastoma (Hep-G2) cells demonstrated that mutant Nrf2 (mNrf2), containing the C506S mutation, was significantly less efficient in activating ARE-mediated gene expression, and induction in response to tert-butyl hydroquinone (t-BHQ), as copmpared with wild-type Nrf2. N-ethyl malemide (NEM), a sulfhydryl cross-linker, inhibited Nrf2 but not mNrf2C506S-mediated expression of NQO1. This further implicated the cysteine at position 506 in Nrf2 regulation of ARE-mediated gene expression. Nuclear localization experiments revealed that C506S mutation did not affect the retention of Nrf2 by INrf2/Keap1 in the cytosol, or its release in response to antioxidants. However, band and supershift assays showed a significant reduction in the binding of mNrf2C506S to the NQO1 gene ARE as compared with wild-type Nrf2. Therefore, the C506S mutation in Nrf2 lowered its affinity for the ARE, leading to decreased expression, and antioxidant induction, of NQO1."

To address functional aspects of MTA1 expression, we established variants of human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) by expressing MTA1 cDNA in both the sense and antisense orientations. We demonstrate that (1) forced MTA1 expression enhances migration and invasion of immortalized keratinocytes; (2) MTA1 expression is necessary but not sufficient for cell survival in the anchorage independent state; (3) MTA1 contributes to expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bcl-x(L); (4) MTA1 expression in immortalized keratinocytes depends, in part, on activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

We thus named the molecule Delta/Notch-like EGF-related receptor (DNER). DNER protein is strongly expressed in several types of post-mitotic neurons, including cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons, cerebellar granule cells, and Purkinje cells. DNER protein is localized to the dendritic plasma membrane and endosomes and is excluded from the axons, even when overexpressed. The tyrosine-based sorting motif in the cytoplasmic domain is required for dendritic targeting of DNER. Direct in vivo binding of DNER to the coat-associated protein complex AP-1 strongly suggests that DNER undergoes AP-1-dependent sorting to the somatodendritic compartments from the trans-Golgi network and subsequent passage through the endosomal system."
https://openalex.org/W1994468555,"Identifying novel and known genes that are differentially expressed in breast cancer has important implications in understanding the biology of breast tumorigenesis and developing new diagnostic and therapeutic agents. In this study we have combined two powerful technologies, PCR-based cDNA subtraction and cDNA microarray, as a high throughput methodology designed to identify cDNA clones that are breast tumor- and tissue-specific and are overexpressed in breast tumors. Approximately 2000 cDNA clones generated from the subtracted breast tumor library were arrayed on the microarray chips. The arrayed target cDNAs were then hybridized with 30 pairs of fluorescent-labeled cDNA probes generated from breast tumors and normal tissues to determine the tissue distribution and tumor specificity. cDNA clones showing overexpression in breast tumors by microarray were further analysed by DNA sequencing, GenBank and EST database searches, and quantitative real time PCR. We identified several known genes, including mammaglobin, cytokeratin 19, fibronectin, and hair-specific type II keratin, which have previously been shown to be overexpressed in breast tumors and may play an important role in the malignance of breast. We also discovered B726P which appears to be an isoform of NY-BR-1, a breast tissue-specific gene. Two additional clones discovered, B709P and GABAA receptor π subunit, were not previously described for their overexpression profile in breast tumors. Thus, combining PCR-based cDNA subtraction and cDNA microarray allowed for an efficient way to identify and validate genes with elevated mRNA expression levels in breast cancer that may potentially be involved in breast cancer progression. These differentially expressed genes may be of potential utility as therapeutic and diagnostic targets for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2054413652,"Signaling of TGFbeta family members such as activin is tightly regulated by soluble binding proteins. Follistatin binds to activin A with high affinity, and prevents activin binding to its own receptors, thereby blocking its signaling. We previously identified FLRG gene from a B-cell leukemia carrying a t(11;19)(q13;p13) translocation. We and others have already shown that FLRG, which is highly homologous to follistatin, may be involved in the regulation of the activin function through its binding to activin. In this study, we found that, like follistatin, FLRG protein inhibited activin A signaling as demonstrated by the use of a transcriptional reporter assay, and blocked the activin A-induced growth inhibition of HepG2 cells. We have recently shown that the TGFbeta-induced expression of FLRG occurs at a transcriptional level through the action of Smad proteins. Here we show that activin A increases FLRG and follistatin at both the mRNA and protein levels. We found that Smad proteins are involved in the activin A-induced transcription activation of FLRG and follistatin. Finally we demonstrate that FLRG protein regulates its own activin-induced expression. In conclusion, activin A induces FLRG and follistatin expression. This observation, in conjunction with the antagonistic effect of FLRG and follistatin on activin signaling, indicates that these two proteins participate in a negative feedback loop which regulates the activin function."

GlcAT-I is an inverting glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid (GlcUA) to the common growing linker region Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl that is attached to a serine side chain of a core protein. Previously the structure of GlcAT-I has been solved in the presence of the donor product UDP and an acceptor analog Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl (Pedersen, L.

Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). These molecules have been implicated in a variety of biological processes such as cell growth and differentiation, blood coagulation, and viral and bacterial infection (3Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M.

Both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate utilize the common linker region GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-Ser to attach to the core protein at specific serine residues. GlcAT-I1 catalyzes the transfer of the GlcUA from the donor substrate UDP-GlcUA to the linker region Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-Ser (5Kitagawa H. Tone Y. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Oka S. Kawasaki T.

Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The heparan polymerases (EXTs) elongate the polysaccharide chain by alternating the addition of GlcUA and GlcNAc (8Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol.

This in turn allows for epimerization of certain GlcUA residues to iduronic acid by C5-epimerase followed by sulfation by specific sulfotransferases such as the 3-O-sulfotransferase, the 2-O-sulfotransferase, and the 6-O-sulfotransferase (3Lindahl U.

Because GlcAT-I lies before these enzymes in the biosynthesis cascade, it appears that its function is essential for proper growth and development as well. To better understand the mechanistic properties of enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis we have used x-ray crystallography to examine amino acid residues required for substrate recognition as well as catalysis for the GlcAT-I enzyme. The enzyme GlcAT-I can be divided into three regions: a membrane-spanning region (residues 8–25), a proline-rich stem region (residues 26–74), and a catalytic domain (residues 75–335). We previously solved the structure of the catalytic domain GlcAT-I in complex with the donor product UDP and an acceptor analog Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl (1Pedersen L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We now report the structure of the enzyme in the presence of the active donor UDP-GlcUA. This structure not only reveals the residues involved in recognizing the GlcUA but also supports the mechanism previously proposed for inverting glycosyltransferases. This provides insight for glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis as well as for many processes that utilize UDP-sugar-dependent glycosyltransferases. Protein of the recombinant human GlcAT-I catalytic domain was cloned, expressed, and purified as previously described (1Pedersen L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Crystals of the enzyme were obtained by the vapor diffusion hanging drop method. 4 μl of 15 mg/ml GlcAT-I in 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 mm UDP-GlcUA was mixed with 4 μl of the reservoir solution containing 21% monomethyl ether polyethylene glycol 2000 (MME-PEG-2000) and 100 mm MES, pH 6.0. Crystals were grown at 23 °C. Although the protein was crystallized in the presence of UDP-GlcUA, only the UDP portion of the molecule was visible in the electron density when data were collected on these crystals (1Pedersen L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Two possibilities exist for the lack of electron density. The first is that the GlcUA portion of the molecule is highly mobile and not fixed in a single conformation. The other possibility is that on the time scale of the crystallization the bond in UDP-GlcUA is hydrolyzed releasing the GlcUA. The latter case has been demonstrated for previous crystallization attempts of T4 phage β-glucosyltransferase with UDP-Glc (14Moréra S. Imberty A. Aschke-Sonnenborn Rüger W. Freemont P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, crystals were transferred to 4 °C. After 30 min crystals were transferred over 1 h in four steps from a solution containing 21% MME-PEG-2000, 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 mm UDP-GlcUA to a solution containing 23% MME-PEG-2000, 100 mm MES, pH 6.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm UDP-GlcUA, and 10% ethylene glycol. Crystals were then immediately flash frozen in a nitrogen gas stream at −170 °C. This technique proved successful as we obtained strong interpretable electron density for the entire UDP-GlcUA molecule (Fig. 1). Diffraction data of GlcAT-1 crystals in the presence of UDP-GlcUA were collected using a RUH3R rotating anode generator and a RAXIS IV area detector system. Reflection data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). The model of GlcAT-I from the ternary complex minus the UDP and acceptor substrate atoms was used as the starting model for refinement. Coordinates were refined using multiple cycles of manual model building with the program “O” (16Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeledgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and refinement in CNS (17Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Acta Crystallogr.

The final model contains residues Met75–Pro140, Trp152–Val335 in molecule A and residues Met75–Pro140, Ala154–Glu244, Arg247–Val335 in molecule B (Table I).

These two molecules have been suggested to represent the physiological dimer (1Pedersen L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of GlcAT-I is made up of two subdomains. Residues 75–197 comprise the NTP-sugar donor substrate binding subdomain, whereas residues 198–308 define the acceptor substrate binding subdomain. The UDP-GlcUA binding subdomain consists of an α/β Rossmann-like motif. The position of the uridine base is fixed through a hydrogen bond with conserved residue Asp113 (3.0 Å) and a ring stacking interaction with Tyr84 (Fig. 1, left and right). The diagnostic feature of the donor binding subdomain is a DXD motif (DDD for GlcAT-I) found at residues Asp194–Asp196. These residues are involved in hydrogen bonding to the UDP portion of the molecule as well as interacting directly with the metal ion (Mn2+) required for catalysis. Asp194 forms a hydrogen bond (2.9 Å) with one of the two water molecules coordinating the Mn2+ ion. Asp195 forms a hydrogen bond with the O2 oxygen of the ribose ring (2.9 Å). Both oxygen atoms from the carboxylate group of Asp196 interact with the Mn2+ metal ion (2.2 Å). The other atoms involved in the octahedral coordination of the Mn2+ ion are oxygen atoms from the α and β phosphates (2.1 and 2.1 Å) of the UDP-GlcUA as well as the two water molecules mentioned above (2.1 and 2.1 Å). The position of the GlcUA is determined though extensive interactions with conserved residues (Figs. 1, left, and2). The 2-hydroxyl forms a hydrogen bond with the NE2 nitrogen of His308 (2.7 Å) and with OD2 of Asp252 (2.5 Å). Asp252 also forms a hydrogen bond with the 4-hydroxyl on the acceptor Gal. This is the only residue that forms hydrogen bonds with both the donor and acceptor molecules (1Pedersen L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The 3-hydroxyl interacts with the OD1 atom of Asp194(2.9 Å) from the DXD motif. The 4-hydroxyl forms hydrogen bonds with both the NH2 nitrogen of Arg161 (3.0 Å) and the carbonyl oxygen of Arg156 (3.0 Å). Finally, an oxygen from the carboxylate group of GlcUA is within hydrogen bonding distance of the backbone amide of Arg156 (2.8 Å). Previously it has been proposed that the catalytic reaction for the inverting glycosyltransferases proceeded through an in-line displacement reaction mechanism (1Pedersen L.C. Tsuchida K. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34580-34585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 19Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar,20Murry B.W. Takayama S. Schultz J. Wong C.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11183-11195Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this scheme a base deprotonates the 3-hydroxyl of the terminal Gal to form a strong nucleophile. The nucleophile then attacks the C1 carbon of the GlcUA from the UDP-GlcUA donor and forms an oxo-carbenium ion-like transition state (Fig. 3). Finally the UDP then dissociates from the GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-Ser product. This would result in an inversion of the stereochemistry with respect to the C-1 bond converting it from an α linkage with the UDP to a β linkage with respect to the Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl. Previously it was assumed that the C1 carbon would be in-line with the leaving oxygen on the β phosphate of UDP and the 3-oxygen of the terminal Gal. However, there were no data to indicate this was true. Therefore it became imperative to obtain the crystal structure of GlcAT-I not only of the UDP/Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl complex but also with the entire UDP-GlcUA donor bound. Superposition of the ternary complex with UDP/Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl and the UDP-GlcUA structures reveals the relative orientation of the donor to the acceptor substrate (Fig. 2). We find that the acceptor substrate binds in a groove in the acceptor binding domain with the Xyl portions of the Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl analog extending away from the protein and with the 3-hydroxyl of the terminal Gal 5.1 Å from the β phosphate of the UDP molecule. Conserved residues Glu227and Arg247 form hydrogen bonds with the 6-hydroxyl of the terminal Gal whereas Asp252 forms a hydrogen bond with the 4-hydroxyl. Glu281 forms a hydrogen bond with the 3-hydroxyl of the terminal Gal moiety, and therefore it has been proposed that this residue may function as the catalytic base. In the superposition the 3-hydroxyl on the acceptor Gal is located 3.8 Å from the C1 carbon of the GlcUA moiety. The C-1 carbon is located between the leaving oxygen of the β phosphate and the incoming 3-hydroxyl of the Gal. This orientation is highly suggestive of an in-line displacement reaction mechanism that supports the previously proposed mechanism for GlcAT-I. The catalytic region of GlcAT-I shows a great deal of similarity to other inverting glycosyltransferases despite little to no sequence identity. The enzymesN-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I from rabbit (GnT1) (21Ünligil U.M. Zhou S. Yuwaraj S. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Rini J.M.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) both share a great deal of structural similarity not only with the nucleotide binding subdomain of GlcAT-I but the overall fold as well. β1,4-Galactosyltransferase from bovine (β4GalT1) (22Gastinel L.N.

Because of the similarities in the fold and the chemical reaction these enzymes catalyze, these enzymes and other NTP-sugar-dependent inverting glycosyltransferases with a similar fold may share a similar mechanism. The donor binding subdomain of GlcAT-I shows a great deal of similarity to other glycosyltransferases such as galactosyltransferase LgtC fromNeisseria meningitis (25Persson K., Ly, H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and bovine α1,3-galactosyltransferase (α3GalT) (26Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H. EMBO J. 2000; 20: 638-649Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar) despite little apparent sequence identity. In addition to the present GlcAT-I structure, four of these structures (GnT1, α3GalT, LgtC, and β4GalT1) have been solved with a complete donor substrate in place (21Ünligil U.M. Zhou S. Yuwaraj S.

EMBO J. 2000; 20: 638-649Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Three of these glycosyltransferase structures contain an acceptor substrate: GlcAT-I, β4GalT1, and LgtC. The first two glycosyltransferases catalyze an inverting transfer reaction and therefore are often called inverting glycosyltransferase, whereas the last one is a retaining glycosyltransferase that catalyzes retaining transfer reaction. To better understand the differences between retaining and inverting transfer reactions we have superimposed the ternary complex structure of LgtC to the previously described ternary complex of GlcAT-I (Fig.4). Despite the fact that GlcAT-I and LgtC are inverting and retaining enzymes, respectively, the UDP-sugar molecules superimpose well. Interactions of the donor substrates with the enzymes are conserved. For example, the corresponding aspartic acids in the DXD motifs superimpose well. The first position of the DXD motif (Asp194 and Asp103of GlcAT-I and LgtC, respectively) interacts with the donor sugar, and the third position (Asp196 and Asp105, respectively) coordinates with the Mn2+ ion. Arg161 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of position 1 in the DXD motif as well as with the donor sugar in the GlcAT-I structure. Arg86 is the equivalent residue found in the LgtC structure, thereby indicating that these interactions are conserved in both structures. Asn153 and Asp252 are also superimposed in the LgtC and GlcAT-I structures, respectively, and both residues are in position to form a hydrogen bond with the O-2 oxygen of the donor sugar substrate (Fig.4). In addition, His244 of LgtC is in a similar location as His308 of GlcAT1 with respect to the donor sugar, although it does not appear to form an interaction with the sugar like His308 but rather interacts with the Mn2+ ion. As a result of these similarities, the orientation and conformation of the donor substrate in the active site are conserved in both the inverting GlcAT-1 and retaining LgtC enzymes. Interestingly, the superposition of the retaining enzyme LgtC with the inverting enzyme GlcAT-I reveals the position of the acceptor substrates to be different with respect to the C-1 carbon of the donor sugar. As a result, the acceptor 4-hydroxyl for LgtC would not be in-line to the leaving UDP (Fig. 4). It has been suggested that the retaining enzymes proceed by a double displacement reaction in which a covalent intermediate to the protein might be formed prior to final transfer of the galactose sugar. The superposition of LgtC to GlcAT-I positions Gln189 of LgtC in a similar position to the O-3 acceptor of GlcAT-I, suggesting it as a catalytic nucleophile in the first transfer (data not shown). Gln189 has been mutated to examine its role as a catalytic residue in the transfer reaction (25Persson K., Ly, H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C.J. Nat. Struct.

Gln189 mutations decreased but did not abolish activity of LgtC, indicating another mechanism other than a double displacement mechanism may be involved for the retaining enzymes (25Persson K., Ly, H.D.

From this analysis it is clear that striking similarities exist between the retaining and inverting glycosyltransferases in the UDP-sugar binding subdomain. However these similarities do not necessarily extend to the acceptor binding subdomain. We have obtained the crystal structure of GlcAT-I in the presence of the donor substrate UDP-GlcUA. This structure has revealed that side chains from conserved residues Arg161, Asp194, Asp252, and His308 as well as backbone interactions from conserved residue Arg156 orient the donor substrate for catalysis. This position of the donor with respect to the acceptor substrate in the superposition supports the previously proposed in-line displacement mechanism for GlcAT-I. Other NTP-dependent inverting glycosyltransferases that share a similar structure may function by an analogous mechanism."

They are tumor suppressors, participate in a wide variety of physiological events, and serve as integrators among different signal transduction pathways. In this study, 11 distinct proteins that have a high degree of homology with the amino acid sequence of p300 have been identified in current protein databases. All of these 11 proteins belong to either animal or plant multicellular organisms (higher eucaryotes). Conservation of p300/CBP domains among these proteins was examined further by sequence alignment and pattern search. The domains of p300/CBP that are required for the HAT function, including PHD, putative CoA-binding, and ZZ domains, are conserved in all of these 11 proteins. This observation is consistent with the previous functional assays and indicates that they are a family of acetyltransferases, i.e. p300/CBP acetyltransferases (PCAT). TAZ domains (TAZ1 and/or TAZ2) of PCAT proteins may allow them to participate in transcription regulation by either directly recruiting transcription factors, acetylating them subsequently, or directing targeted acetylation of nucleosomal histones."

Several obvious and significant motifs were found in MMAC/PTEN, including most notably, a catalytic domain of tyrosine phosphatase (IHCxxGxxRS/T) and several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. To examine the functional significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of MMAC/PTEN, retroviral constructs were generated with mutations at two putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Y240A/Y240F and Y315A/Y315F). Stable expression of wild-type MMAC/PTEN in U251 human glioma cells (which do not normally produce a functional MMAC/PTEN gene product) resulted in a significant reduction of tumor growth in nude mice, decreased growth rate, saturation density, and colony formation in vitro, as well as dephosphorylation of D3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) in vitro. Mutation of Y240 or Y315 to either alanine or phenylalanine abrogated the ability of MMAC/PTEN to alter growth rate, saturation density, and colony formation in vitro. The ability of MMAC/PTEN to limit tumor growth in nude mice was markedly decreased but not abrogated by mutation of Y240 or Y315 to alanine. Thus, Y240 and Y315 are required for MMAC/PTEN to decrease tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to wild-type MMAC/PTEN, mutant MMAC/PTEN containing Y240A or Y315A was unable to dephosphorylate D3-phosphorylated PtdIns in vitro. Thus, Y240A and Y315A are involved in the ability of MMAC/PTEN to dephosphorylate PtdIns and regulate tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo."

In this mutant, the processes that involve the transfer of one electron from either PSI or FNR are clearly accelerated, which might be attributable to a larger accessibility of the flavin to the reductant. However, when the opposite ET flow is analyzed with FNR, the reduced Y94A mutant transfers electrons to FNR slightly more slowly than wild type. This can be explained thermodynamically from a decrease in driving force due to the significant shift of 137 mV in the reduction potential value for the semiquinone/hydroquinone couple (E 1) of Y94A, relative to wild type (Lostao, A., Gómez-Moreno, C., Mayhew, S.

One of them is a widely conserved tyrosine that makes extensive contacts with the isoalloxazine, whereas the other aromatic residue is usually a tryptophan that interacts mainly with the two methyl groups of the isoalloxazine (11Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The proximity of the two aromatic residues to the flavin ring makes them interesting candidates to play a role in modulating the reduction potentials of flavodoxin and, therefore, modulating the protein's ability to play specific functions in the electron transfer chains where it is involved. The influence of these aromatic residues on FMN binding, flavodoxin reduction potentials, and electron spin density distribution of the semiquinone state has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis using flavodoxins from different sources (11Lostao A.

Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2001; 57: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge, the influence of these aromatic residues on flavodoxin ET reactions has not been analyzed. In Anabaena Fld, the functionality of site-directed mutants with removal of surface negative side chains has been reported, not only with its physiological partners (PSI and FNR) but also with other ET proteins (16Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Genzor C.G. Cheddar G. Fillat M.F., De la Rosa M.A. Gómez-Moreno C. Cheng H. Xia B. Chae Y.K. Yan H. Wong B. Straus N.A. Markley J.L. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem.

The introduced mutations exerted only little effects on the reactions with FNR and PSI, whereas they showed larger effects on the nonphysiological reactions with cytochrome c and cytochrome P450.In Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 Fld, the flavin-sandwiching residues are Trp57 and Tyr94 (the only side chains in contact with the flavin ring) (9Rao S.T. Shaffie F., Yu, C. Satyshur K.A. Stockman B.J. Markley J.L. Sundaralingan M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1413-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Previous characterization of several Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 Fld mutants at positions 57 and 94 has shown that these aromatic residues, in particular Tyr94, influence the cofactor reduction potentials and its absorption spectrum. In addition, measurement of the apoflavodoxin-FMN complex binding energies showed that both Tyr94 and Trp57 strengthen the interaction of apoflavodoxin with FMN in the different redox states and are responsible for setting the characteristic reduction potentials exhibited by this protein (11Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been shown that replacement of Tyr94 and Trp57 only very slightly influences the electron spin density distribution in the flavodoxin semiquinone state (14Medina M. Lostao A. Sancho J. Gómez-Moreno C. Cammack R. Alonso P.J. Martı́nez J. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1712-1720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the functional characterization ofAnabaena sp. PCC 7119 Fld mutants obtained by replacement of Trp57 and Tyr94 by other aromatic residues as well as by alanine and leucine (11Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Complex formation and ET between PSI and Fld and between Fld and FNR have been studied for the WT and mutated forms of Fld in order to analyze the involvement of Tyr94 and Trp57 in these processes. So far, none of the three-dimensional structures of the mutants here characterized is available. However, recently, the structures of two Fld mutants from Desulfovibrio vulgaris at the equivalent position to Tyr94 from Anabaena Fld, Y98H and Y98W, have been reported (15Reynolds R.A. Watt W. Watenpaugh K.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2001; 57: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since precise main-chain and side-chain superposition is observed between the structures of WT Flds from both species, specially around the flavin ring, the functional behavior of the Anabaena mutants is discussed based on the structural features observed for these two D. vulgaris mutant structures.DISCUSSIONTrp57 and Tyr94, which sandwich the isoalloxazine ring in Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 Fld, have been shown to influence its reduction potentials and absorption spectra and to strengthen the FMN apoflavodoxin interaction (11Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have analyzed their influence on the Fld interaction and ET by measuring the functionality of different Fld mutants at positions 57 and 94 with its two physiological redox partners, FNR and PSI.Steady-state and fast kinetic studies have been carried out to analyze the reactions of Fld with FNR. The K m values obtained for FNR, using the different Fld variants as protein carriers in the NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase assay (Table I), as well as the data derived from differential spectroscopic analysis of the FNRox-Fldox interaction (Fig. 1, TableII) indicate that the introduced mutations do not produce any major effect in the stability of the FNRox·Fldoxcomplex or in the functionality of the FNRrd·Fldox complex. However, some of the mutations clearly alter the ET between the two proteins. The most noticeable alteration is produced upon replacement of Tyr94by alanine. In this mutant, processes involving ET from FNRrd to Fldox show rates up to 5-fold higher than those obtained with WT Fld when monitoring the FNR cytochromec reductase activity (Table I) and up to 222-fold higher when following the direct reaction by stopped flow (Fig. 3 B, Table III). Previous studies, however, had shown that FNRrdis apparently not so well suited for transferring a single electron to WT Fldox as it is to Fdox(E m = −384 mV) (29Hurley J.K. Weber-Main A.N. Stankovich M.T. Benning M.M. Thoden J.B. Vanhooke J.L. Holden H.M. Chae J.K. Xia B. Cheng H. Markley J.L. Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Gómez-Moreno C. Schmeits J.L. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11100-11117Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas FNRsqis much more efficient (rate constant >7000 s−1 (30Walker M.C. Pueyo J.J. Gómez-Moreno C. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). These findings reveal the importance of the structural features of the proteins participating in ET processes over thermodynamic factors (18Medina M. Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Gómez-Moreno C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2715-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Since, in the case of the Y94A mutant, the introduced side chain does not provide an electronic environment that can improve by itself the ET process, structural and thermodynamic aspects have to account for the enhancement observed. The reported reduction potentials for this mutant show an E 1 value considerably less negative than that for WT Fld (−299 mV versus −436 mV), indicating that in this mutant the entrance of the second electron is thermodynamically favored, which might allow a full reduction of Y94A Fldsqby FNRrd or even by FNRsq. This could explain the high k cat value observed for FNR in the NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reductase assay when using Y94A; once enough Y94A Fldrd is formed, it might cycle between the hydroquinone and semiquinone states when transferring electrons from FNR to cytochrome c, thus working under a thermodynamic force closer to that operating in the Fd assay. However, an enhancement of the ET from FNRrd to Fldoxshould not be discarded. To clarify this, we have followed the FNRrd/Fldox reaction by stopped flow. The increase in absorbance observed at 600 nm (Fig. 3 B) indicates a very fast accumulation of semiquinone states, which is not consistent with a two-electron transfer process and suggests a single electron transfer and accumulation of the two semiquinone species. Therefore, the larger efficiency observed when analyzing the ET from FNRrd to Y94A Fldox has to be due to a faster single ET process to generate Y94A Fldsq. Since complex formation is apparently not affected and the E 2value for this mutant is similar to that for WT Fld, structural aspects have to account for the enhancement of the process. We suggest that replacement of the large tyrosine residue by the small alanine might help by simply making the flavin cofactor more accessible to reduction. Consistently, replacement of tyrosine by tryptophan (with a larger side chain) in the Y94W mutant would make the flavin cofactor less accessible, thereby explaining the lower ET rate from FNRrdto the mutant, as shown by both steady-state and fast kinetic studies (Tables I and III). This hypothesis is supported by the structures reported for two mutants from D. vulgaris Fld, Y98H and Y98W, at a position equivalent to that of Tyr94 inAnabaena Fld (15Reynolds R.A. Watt W. Watenpaugh K.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2001; 57: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These structures show that, although the overall folding remains the same as that of native Fld, the environment of the isoalloxazine ring is modified by the introduced mutations. Noticeably, in both mutants the 60–64 loop, (Trp60corresponds to Trp57 in the Anabaena Fld) is displaced and resembles more the structure of the Fld semireduced state than that of the oxidized state. Moreover, the hydrogen-bonding network and the water scheme around the FMN are different, and both mutant structures show a slight bending in the FMN isoalloxazine ring. In particular, the structure of the Y98W mutant clearly shows a larger shielding of the flavin from the solvent, especially at positions N-5, where a proton has to enter in order to produce the reduced and semiquinone states of FMN, and C-6 of the flavin ring. This strongly suggests that the observed decreased reactivity of Y94WAnabaena Fld in the ET processes with FNR is due to a decreased accessibility of the flavin cofactor. On the other hand, the structure of the Y98H mutant from D. vulgaris Fld shows less shielding of the flavin ring from the solvent, with the benzene ring fully exposed. This lack of shielding has been related with the noticeable E 1 shift to more positive values exhibited by this mutant (15Reynolds R.A. Watt W. Watenpaugh K.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2001; 57: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A similar E 1shift has been found in our Y94A mutant (11Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting also a large accessibility of the isoalloxazine ring in this mutant, as expected for a Tyr to Ala replacement.However, when analyzing the opposite process, reduction of FNR by Fld variants, Y94A ET is hindered relative to WT Fld. This is so because the introduced mutation produces an important alteration of the flavinE 1 value, which is 137 mV more positive than that of WT, making reduction of FNR (E m = −323 mV (29Hurley J.K. Weber-Main A.N. Stankovich M.T. Benning M.M. Thoden J.B. Vanhooke J.L. Holden H.M. Chae J.K. Xia B. Cheng H. Markley J.L. Martı́nez-Júlvez M. Gómez-Moreno C. Schmeits J.L. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11100-11117Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)) much less favorable from the thermodynamic point of view. The Y94W, W57F, and W57Y Fld mutants (Fig. 2 B) do not show any major alterations of the reduction potentials, yet they display a lag phase and slower and diminished processes. In these mutants, structural aspects must account for the observed lag phase, indicative of the accumulation of an intermediate prior to ET, and suggesting that complex reorganization cannot achieve the optimal orientation in the transition state for efficient ET.Interaction and ET between reduced PSI and the different Flds were analyzed by using laser flash photolysis. For WT Fld, the obtained kinetic parameters are of the same order of magnitude as those previously described for the interaction of this flavoprotein with PSI from different sources (16Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Genzor C.G. Cheddar G. Fillat M.F., De la Rosa M.A. Gómez-Moreno C. Cheng H. Xia B. Chae Y.K. Yan H. Wong B. Straus N.A. Markley J.L. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Mühlenhoff U. Sétif P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1367-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The similar association constants obtained with either WT Fld or the different mutants for the PSIrd·Fldox complex suggest that the binding ability of Fld to PSI is not affected by the introduced mutations (Table IV). As observed when analyzing reduction by FNRrd, reduction of Y94A Fld by PSI presents a value ofk et much higher than WT. This must, again, be due to a higher accessibility of the flavin cofactor to reduction in the Y94A mutant. Consistent with this interpretation, Y94W is virtually nonreactive with PSI (Table IV). It is noticeable that whereas most replacements of Trp57 with smaller hydrophobic residues optimize the electron transfer from PSI to Fld with respect to WT, an important decrease is observed for the W57Y variant (Table IV). This finding clearly indicates that the hydroxyl group is impairing the ET reaction.The aforementioned studies indicate that removal of the aromatic side chain in the Y94A mutant increases the accessibility of the cofactor to the FMN one-electron reduction process (Tables I, III, and IV), whereas thermodynamic factors would favor the entrance of the second electron (11Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which would produce accumulation of Fldrd in the cells upon light irradiation. However, the thermodynamic driving force would oppose ET from fully reduced Fld to its physiological substrate, FNR. Thus, our data clearly indicate that Tyr94 is not required for ET from PSI to FNR via Fld; however, the occurrence in Fld of a tyrosine residue at that position is necessary to modulate the FMNE 1 value and for a strong FMN binding (11Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, it provides a compromise between efficient PSI/Fld and Fld/FNR ET. Previous studies suggested a possible role for Trp57 in the kinetics of Fld redox reactions (11Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that mutants at this position can accept electrons from FNRrd as efficiently as WT (Table I and III) and much more efficiently from PSI (Table IV). Moreover, replacement of Trp57 by leucine or alanine does not produce major alterations in the Fld ability to reduce FNR, although almost no reduction of W57F or W57Y Flds is detected. Our data, thus, indicate that Trp57 cannot be directly involved in the ET process itself but rather provides an appropriate structural and electronic environment while cooperating with Tyr94 in FMN binding (11Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).In summary, in the ET process from PSI to FNR via Fld, the aromatic residues stacking the FMN cofactor appear not to be directly involved in the ET pathway. Thus, in the case of Anabaena Fld, the flavin environment, provided by Trp57 and Tyr94, might not be the most “productive” one for each individual process, but it represents an efficient compromise for the different ET steps and allows a tight FMN binding in order to optimize the overall process of ET from PSI to NADP+. Flavodoxins are small α/β flavoproteins involved in ET1 reactions in microorganisms and certain algae. They can be synthesized constitutively or induced by a lack of iron in the culture medium (1Mayhew S.G. Tollin G. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III.

The principal feature of flavodoxins is that they contain a noncovalently bound low potential flavin cofactor (FMN) that confers redox properties to the protein. The binding of FMN to flavodoxin considerably increases the stability of the cofactor semiquinone state by altering its reduction potentials. Typically, the midpoint potential for the quinone/semiquinone couple, E 2, is increased, whereas that of the semiquinone/hydroquinone couple,E 1, is decreased.

Biol. 1996; 3: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In most flavodoxins, the isoalloxazine ring (the redox-active moiety of FMN) is stacked between two aromatic residues. One of them is a widely conserved tyrosine that makes extensive contacts with the isoalloxazine, whereas the other aromatic residue is usually a tryptophan that interacts mainly with the two methyl groups of the isoalloxazine (11Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The proximity of the two aromatic residues to the flavin ring makes them interesting candidates to play a role in modulating the reduction potentials of flavodoxin and, therefore, modulating the protein's ability to play specific functions in the electron transfer chains where it is involved. The influence of these aromatic residues on FMN binding, flavodoxin reduction potentials, and electron spin density distribution of the semiquinone state has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis using flavodoxins from different sources (11Lostao A.

Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2001; 57: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge, the influence of these aromatic residues on flavodoxin ET reactions has not been analyzed. In Anabaena Fld, the functionality of site-directed mutants with removal of surface negative side chains has been reported, not only with its physiological partners (PSI and FNR) but also with other ET proteins (16Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Genzor C.G. Cheddar G. Fillat M.F., De la Rosa M.A. Gómez-Moreno C. Cheng H. Xia B. Chae Y.K. Yan H. Wong B. Straus N.A. Markley J.L. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Arch. Biochem.

The introduced mutations exerted only little effects on the reactions with FNR and PSI, whereas they showed larger effects on the nonphysiological reactions with cytochrome c and cytochrome P450. In Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 Fld, the flavin-sandwiching residues are Trp57 and Tyr94 (the only side chains in contact with the flavin ring) (9Rao S.T. Shaffie F., Yu, C. Satyshur K.A. Stockman B.J. Markley J.L. Sundaralingan M. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1413-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Previous characterization of several Anabaena sp. PCC 7119 Fld mutants at positions 57 and 94 has shown that these aromatic residues, in particular Tyr94, influence the cofactor reduction potentials and its absorption spectrum. In addition, measurement of the apoflavodoxin-FMN complex binding energies showed that both Tyr94 and Trp57 strengthen the interaction of apoflavodoxin with FMN in the different redox states and are responsible for setting the characteristic reduction potentials exhibited by this protein (11Lostao A. Gómez-Moreno C. Mayhew S.G. Sancho J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14334-14344Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been shown that replacement of Tyr94 and Trp57 only very slightly influences the electron spin density distribution in the flavodoxin semiquinone state (14Medina M. Lostao A.

https://openalex.org/W2037343820,"Ras family GTPases play central roles in a wide variety of biological responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenic transformation. We searched for novel guanine nucleotide exchange factors of HRas and isolated small G-protein dissociation stimulator (smgGDS), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor known to act on numerous Ras and Rho family GTPases. SmgGDS specifically interacts with both dominant negative and nucleotide free forms of H and NRas, but not with the corresponding oncogenic forms. An effector domain mutant of HRas, HRasN17G37, selectively lost the ability to bind smgGDS. However, smgGDS does not catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange on either H or NRas in vitro. In contrast, substrates of smgGDS, such as KRas, Rac1, and RhoA, bind to smgGDS in both active and inactive forms which requires the presence of poly-basic residues in the C-termini of the GTPases. Our data suggest that the C-terminal poly-basic region of small GTPases is important for both binding and nucleotide exchange by smgGDS. Furthermore, these data underscore the idea that mammalian Ras isoforms are not functionally equivalent."
https://openalex.org/W2065214188,"Heteroduplex joints represent intermediates of Rad51-dependent recombination processes, which are recognized by p53 with extremely high affinities, in a manner independent of the DNA sequence content. To determine the structural elements required for complex formation, we monitored DNA-binding by protection against restriction endonuclease cleavage. We show that wild-type (wt) p53 interacts with heteroduplex joints in the proximity of the flexible junction. Association of p53 within this junction region was also observed with preformed Rad51-heteroduplex complexes, whereas SSB counteracted p53 binding. At a distance of 31 bp from the junction p53 established very few contacts with the heteroduplex, despite the presence of an A-G mismatch. Consistently, p53-dependent exonucleolytic degradation decreased when we raised the distance between the junction and the heteroduplex terminus by 27 bp. Different from the cancer-related mutant p53(273H), which did not recognize the junction, tetramerization defective p53-1262 was protection competent but displayed reduced complex stability in gel shifts. Moreover, p53-1262 performed exonucleolytic activities towards ssDNA like wtp53, but reduced degradation of heteroduplex joints. These results suggest that during recombination wild-type p53, as a tetramer, stably binds to strand transfer regions, enabling the protein to exonucleolytically correct heteroduplex intermediates early after strand invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2080642736,"Stress signals elicit a wide variety of cellular responses, many of which converge on the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 kinases, the activation of which has been well-characterized. How these kinases are switched off by dephosphorylation is not well understood. Here we describe how diverse cellular stresses affect differently the stability and activity of a JNK-inactivating dual-specificity threonine-tyrosine phosphatase M3/6. Both anisomycin and arsenite activate the JNK pathway and, in addition, inactivate the M3/6 phosphatase. However, while anisomycin treatment of cells leads to M3/6 protein degradation, arsenite appears to inactivate M3/6 directly. These results might have implications for the mechanism of tumour promotion by arsenic."
https://openalex.org/W2327390910,"Retinoic acid (RA) inhibits tumor promotion in many models in vivo and in vitro, among them mouse epidermal JB6 cells. RA treatment suppresses 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced AP-1 activity, an activity that is required for transformation of JB6 P+ cells. The molecular mechanism of AP-1 transrepression by retinoids is unclear, especially as related to inhibition of transformation. Overexpression of AP-1 components did not rescue TPA induced AP-1 activation nor did a GST pull down experiment implicate direct binding, thus rendering unlikely both a Jun/Fos-RA-RAR direct interaction and a Jun/Fos sequestration mechanism. Overexpression of p300, SRC-1 or pCAF did not abrogate AP-1 suppression by RA, thus arguing against coactivator competition. Overexpression of the corepressor silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) suppressed AP-1 activity. However, SMRT but not RA inhibited cJun transactivation, suggesting SMRT does not mediate RA transrepression. RA treatment also did not block TPA induced ERK phosphorylation, Jun/Fos family protein expression except for cFos, or DNA binding of the AP-1 complex. The transcriptional activities of full-length JunB and full-length Fra-1, but not the transactivation domain fusions, were increased by TPA treatment and suppressed by RA. Since these full-length fusions have bzip domains, the results suggest that JunB and/or Fra-1-containing dimers may constitute one target of RA for transrepression of AP-1."

By using a couple of recombinant CHO cells differing only from the exogenous expression of Pol beta, we showed here that cells overexpressing Pol beta are much more sensitive to IR treatments by increasing apoptosis. We also found that the surviving cells displayed an hypermutator phenotype which could be explained by different pathways involving Pol beta, such as (i) an increased capacity to incorporate into DNA the mutagenic dGTP analog, 8-oxo-dGTP, one of the most abundant purine-derived nucleotides exposed to gamma-irradiation, (ii) the induction of IR-induced DNA breaks and (iii) accumulation of chromosome aberrations induced by radiation. Alteration of Pol beta expression in irradiated cells thus appears to strengthen both cell death and genetic changes associated with a malignant phenotype. These data provide new insights into the cellular response to radiations and the associated carcinogenic consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1998405263,"Evidence indicates that overexpression of cyclin D1 is an important event in malignant transformation of breast cancer cells. Therefore, cyclin D1 is a potential target for mechanistically-based chemoprevention/treatment of breast cancer. Treatment of serum-stimulated quiescent MCF-7 breast cancer cells with cyclopentenone (2-cyclopenten-1-one) blocked progression through G1 and into S phase. Growth arrest of the cyclopentenone-treated cells in G1 was associated with changes in the levels of several proteins that control the cell cycle, including a dramatic decrease in cyclin D1 protein expression. Cyclopentenone also decreased the abundance of cyclin D1 mRNA and nuclear transcripts, indicating that it regulated cyclin D1 expression at the transcriptional level. Cyclopentenone selectively inhibited the activity of the cyclin D1 and cyclin A promoters but not the activity of several other control promoters. Deletion analysis indicated that the cyclopentenone response element was located in the cyclin D1 core promoter. Additional functional studies showed that a sequence within the core promoter (CycY, located downstream from the initiator element) played an important role in activation of the cyclin D1 promoter in MCF-7 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated specific binding of the transcription factor BTEB to the CycY site. The cyclopentenone response element did not correspond to the CycY site but rather mapped to the initiator element itself. The overall results suggest that cyclopentenone interferes with the transcription initiation complex that assembles over the cyclin D1 initiator element, leading to selective inhibition of cyclin D1 gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2088608928,"The Mdm2 proto-oncogene is amplified and over-expressed in a variety of tumors. One of the major functions of Mdm2 described to date is its ability to modulate the levels and activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Mdm2 binds to the N-terminus of p53 and, through its action as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targets p53 for rapid proteasomal degradation. Mdm2 can also bind to other cellular proteins such as hNumb, E2F1, Rb and Akt; however, the biological significance of these interactions is less clear. To gain insight into the function of Mdm2 in vivo, we have generated a transgenic Drosophila strain bearing the mouse Mdm2 gene. Ectopic expression of Mdm2, using the UAS/GAL4 system, causes eye and wing phenotypes in the fly. Analysis of wing imaginal discs from third instar larvae showed that expression of Mdm2 induces apoptosis. Crosses did not reveal genetic interactions between Mdm2 and the Drosophila homolog of E2F, Numb and Akt. These transgenic flies may provide a unique experimental model for exploring the molecular interactions of Mdm2 in a developmental context."

Differences in the Bmax values were observed as well with a CHO clone expressing a lower level of NK-1 receptors in membrane homogenates prepared from the clone with the highest expression and in rat submandibular glands (7Sagan S.

Altogether these results suggest that the differences in Bmax values for the two types of ligands cannot be explained by effects secondary to G-protein interactions. With a plethora of SP analogs in CHO cells expressing high levels of the human NK-1 receptor, the binding affinity for the more abundant binding site could be correlated to the potency to accumulate cAMP, whereas the binding affinity for the less abundant site could be correlated to the potency to activate inositol phosphate production (8Sagan S.

Although several structure-activity relationship studies have been carried out, little is known about the differences in the molecular recognition of these two binding sites (8Sagan S. Karoyan P.

Photoaffinity labeling therefore appeared to be a complementary method of studying the interaction of both types of peptide agonists with the NK-1 receptor. Photolabeling of the rat NK-1 receptor with a SP and a NKA photoactivatable analog has been reported recently, and subsequent mapping studies have established that the site of photoinsertion was located in the same segment of the second extracellular loop (E2) of the receptor, probably on an identical residue Met181(13Bremer A.A. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used the same “one-pot” strategy of photolabeling, enzymatic digestion, and purification before matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis described previously (14Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), with two photoactivatable analogs of SP designed to screen the two binding sites associated with the NK-1 receptor. Both photoactivatable SP analogs, [BAPA-Lys6,(p-Bz)Phe8,Pro9,Met(O2)11]SP-(7–11) and [BAPA0,(p-Bz)Phe8]SP, contain a biotinyl sulfone moiety at the N-terminal end, which is separated from the first amino acid by an aminopentanoic acid flexible spacer (BAPA). After photolabeling and enzymatic digestion(s), this biotinyl sulfone moiety is used to purify the fragment of interest via streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (14Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Girault S. Chassaing G. Bolbach G. Blais J.-C. Brunot A. Anal.

Using this strategy, we have previously shown that the SP analog photoactivatable in position 8, [BAPA0,(p-Bz)Phe8]SP, as well as the constrained selective NK-1 analog [BAPA0,(p-Bz)Phe8,Pro9]SP, specifically interact with Met174 in the second extracellular loop of the human NK-1 receptor (14Girault S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25797-25800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) identified Met181 as the site of interaction of this photoreactive amino acid in the rat NK-1 receptor, whereas Li et al. (17Li Y.-M. Marnerakis M. Stimson E.R. Maggio J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1213-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) established that domain 173–183 was the site of covalent interaction with the NK-1 receptor on the murine cell line P388D1. In this study, we examined the pharmacological profiles of [BAPA-Lys6,(p-Bz)Phe8,Pro9,Met(O2)11]SP-(7–11) and [BAPA0,(p-Bz)Phe8]SP on the two binding sites associated with the NK-1 receptor and carried out photolabeling studies using the strategy described previously (15Girault S. Chassaing G. Bolbach G. Blais J.-C. Brunot A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 2122-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with CHO clones expressing either the human or the rat NK-1 receptor. The results indicate that residue Met174 in the E2 loop is probably the site of covalent attachment. Models of the conformation of the E2 loop were built using two different strategies, one based on homology with bovine rhodopsin and the other on the solution conformation preferences of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the E2 loop. [[11-3H]Pro9]SP (2400 GBq/mmol) was synthesized at the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (Saclay, France) according to Chassaing et al.(18Chassaing G. Lavielle S. Julien S. Marquet A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 623-626Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). [[3H]Propionyl-Met(O2)11]SP-(7–11) (3700 GBq/mmol) was synthesized as described (7Sagan S. Beaujouan J.-C. Torrens Y. Saffroy M. Chassaing G. Glowinski J. Lavielle S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Boc-l-(p-Bz)Phe was prepared according to the general strategy developed in our laboratory for nonproteinogenic amino acids (19Ayoub M. Chassaing G. Loffet A. Lavielle S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 23: 4069-4072Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized by solid-phase methodology on a p-methylbenzhydrylamine resin as described (14Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the peptides exhibited the expected quasi-molecular ion: [BAPA-Lys6,(p-Bz)Phe8,Pro9,Met(O2)11]SP-(7–11), MH+ at m/z 1274.66; and [BAPA0,(p-Bz)Phe8]SP, MH+ at m/z 1808.89 (m/z values are monoisotopic). The corresponding radioligands, [BAPA-(ε-CT3CT2CO)Lys0,(p-Bz)Phe8,Pro9,Met(O2)11]SP-(7–11) and [BAPA0,(ε-CT3CT2CO)Lys3,(p-Bz)Phe8]SP, were synthesized by acylation of the lysine side chain byN-hydroxysuccinimidyl-[2,3-3H]propionate (3700 GBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), as previously described (7Sagan S. Beaujouan J.-C. Torrens Y. Saffroy M. Chassaing G. Glowinski J. Lavielle S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing the human or rat NK-1 receptor were cultured in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cultures were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Stable transfection was maintained by Geneticin (400 mg/liter). Both CHO clones express similar levels of the human or the rat NK-1 receptor (6 pmol/mg proteins). Membranes were prepared as described (14Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and stored in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmMnCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10% glycerol at −80 °C. Binding assays were carried out at 15–20 °C for 100 min ([[3H]Pro9]SP) or 80 min ([[3H]propionyl-Met(O2)11]SP-(7–11)) on whole cells (5 × 103 and 5 × 104cells/well for [[3H]Pro9]SP and [[3H]propionyl-Met(O2)11]SP-(7–11), respectively) in Krebs-Ringer phosphate solution consisting of 120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 15.6 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, containing 0.04% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 0.6% glucose (w/v), 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor as described (7Sagan S. Beaujouan J.-C. Torrens Y. Saffroy M. Chassaing G. Glowinski J. Lavielle S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All determinations were performed in duplicate in at least three independent experiments. Inositol phosphate hydrolysis and cAMP accumulation were determined as described (5Sagan S. Chassaing G. Pradier L. Lavielle S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar). All determinations were performed in duplicate in at least three independent experiments. Membranes (1–2 mg of protein at a concentration of 1 mg/ml protein) from CHO cells expressing the rat or the human NK-1 receptor were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 100 nm of [BAPA-Lys6,(p-Bz)Phe8,Pro9,Met(O2)11]SP-(7–11) or [BAPA0,(p-Bz)Phe8]SP in 50 mm Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 400 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The membrane preparation was then irradiated on ice for 40 min using an ultraviolet light at 365 nm (HPR 125-watt lamp) at a distance of 6 to 10 cm. After irradiation, [Pro9]SP (10 μm) was added for 10 min to the membrane preparation prior to centrifugation for 2 min at 13,000 rpm (MSE Micro Centaur). The sample was then washed with Tris-Cl buffer and centrifuged again. Finally, photolabeled membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in a denaturation buffer consisting of 17 mmdithiothreitol and 3% SDS in 50 μl of Tris-Cl 50 mm, pH 8.0. After denaturation, photolabeled membranes were digested for 5–24 h at 22 °C in 1 ml of 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, with 100 μg of trypsin (ketone-treatedl-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl; Sigma). Digestion was stopped by adding 10 μl of PMSF (100 mm) and 10 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (5 μg.μl−1). The tryptic digested sample was incubated with 100 μg of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M280, Dynal) for 2 to12 h under gentle agitation. The beads were then washed as described previously (14Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The sample was then either submitted to further digestion with endo-GluC or analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. After purification and washing (14Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the beads were incubated at 37 °C for 15 h with 20 μg of endo-GluC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 20 μl of 100 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.8. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of PMSF (100 mm) and 10 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (5 μg.μl−1); 100 μg of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were again added for 2 h. Purification and washing steps were performed as described (14Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The sample was then either submitted to further digestion with carboxypeptidase Y or analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. After purification and washing (14Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the beads were incubated at 37 °C for 2 to 24 h with 0.05 μg of carboxypeptidase Y in 20 μl of 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0. After incubation the beads were washed as described (14Girault S. Sagan S. Bolbach G. Lavielle S. Chassaing G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Peptide fragments were eluted from the magnetic beads with 3 μl of MALDI matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 4:1 (v/v) CH3CN/H2O (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). After a 10-min incubation, 1 μl of bead-free supernatant was deposited on the sample holder for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. MALDI-TOF mass spectra (averaged over 256 laser shots) were obtained in positive mode on a Voyager Elite (PerSeptive Biosystems) mass spectrometer in the reflector mode. For weak ion signals, a better signal/noise ratio was obtained by averaging 10 mass spectra. External calibration was applied using standard peptides deposited on the MALDI-TOF target very close to the studied sample. In the following, the measured and indicated m/z values are monoisotopic. Peptide receptor domains corresponding to the mass peaks obtained from MALDI-TOF MS analysis were identified using the Protein Analysis WorkSheet freeware edition (ProteoMics; http://www.proteomics.com) and applied to the NK-1 receptor (human and rat) using the different proteases. A peptide encompassing the E2 loop of the NK-1 receptor and named E2 peptide, Ac-YSTTETMPSRVVSMIEWPEHPNKIYEKVY-NH2, was synthesized by solid-phase methodology using t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems Model 431A synthesizer (7Sagan S. Beaujouan J.-C. Torrens Y. Saffroy M. Chassaing G. Glowinski J. Lavielle S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Synthesis was carried out on an 0.1-mmol scale, starting from ap-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (typical substitution, 0.68 mmol/g of resin). All N-α-t-butyloxycarbonyl amino acids were assembled using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole as coupling reagents. A 10-fold excess of each amino acid was used. The peptide was cleaved from the resin by anhydrous fluorhydric acid in the presence of scavengers and purified to homogeneity by preparative reverse phase C8 HPLC using water and acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as the solvent system. The peptide purity was determined by analytical reverse phase HPLC, and its structural integrity was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. NMR spectra were recorded at temperatures ranging from 293 to 313 K on 2 mmpeptide in 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O in the presence of 80 mmSDS-d 25 and in mixed solvents containing either 25 or 50% (v/v) TFE-d 3 in H2O, 10%2H2O, or 80% (v/v) TFE-d 2 in H2O. Sodium 3-trimethylsilyl(2,2,3,3-2H4)propionate was used as an internal 1H chemical shift reference. NMR experiments were collected on a Bruker AM 500 or DMX 500 spectrometers and processed with an Aspect 3000 computer or with Bruker UXNMR software. Solvent suppression was achieved by low power irradiation during the relaxation delay (1.5 s) or with a WATERGATE sequence prior to acquisition (20Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar). To obtain sequence-specific resonance assignments, the following two-dimensional homonuclear experiments were recorded using conventional pulse sequences: DQF-COSY (21Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar), clean-TOCSY (22Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) with 30–80 ms mixing times, and NOESY (23Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar) with 60–300 ms mixing times. To identify amide protons in slow exchange with solvent, the sample containing 25% TFE was lyophilized and resuspended in2H2O, and a two-dimensional TOCSY experiment was recorded at 288 K over a period of 4 h. Typical experiments were acquired with 2048 points in t 2 and 400–600 increments in t 1 over a spectral width of 5000 Hz. Prior to Fourier transformation, the time domain data were multiplied with a sine-bell window shifted by π/3 and zero-filled. Base-line distortions were corrected using a fifth-order polynomial. Interproton distance restraints were derived from NOESY experiments recorded at 273 K with mixing times of 150 and 300 ms. The NOESY cross-peak intensities were converted into distance ranges of 0.18 to 0.28, 0.18 to 0.38, and 0.18–0.50 nm corresponding to strong, medium, and weak NOEs, respectively. Equivalent methyl protons, aromatic protons, and nonresolved methylene protons were treated as pseudoatoms, and correction factors were applied to distance limits (24Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Backbone dihedral angles were restrained from measurement of 3JHN-Hα coupling constants, HN-Hα NOE intensities, and Hα chemical shift deviations. Structure calculations were carried out on Silicon graphics O2stations. Fifty structures were calculated by torsion angle dynamics with the DYANA program (25Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). The 20 structures with the lowest target function were energy-minimized in XPLOR (26Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using CHARMM 22 force field (27Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). The structure quality was evaluated using PROCHECK-NMR (28Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). Models of the human NK-1 receptor were built on Silicon Graphics O2 workstations with the Modeler program (29Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) using the crystallographic structure of bovine rhodopsin as a template (Protein Data Bank code 1F88) (30Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 239: 739-745Crossref Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). The initial models were refined in XPLOR by applying several cycles of conjugate-gradient minimization with decreasing constraints on backbone atom positions. The CHARMM 22 force field was used. Nonbonded interactions were calculated with an 8 Å cutoff. The structures were analyzed with Insight II, and the quality of the models was evaluated using PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S,. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The structure of the E2 loop in the NK-1 receptor was calculated by simulated annealing, using the same set of restraints as used for the NMR structure calculation of the isolated loop in solution. Thirty structures were calculated in XPLOR starting from the homology-built structure. Residues were partitioned into three regions according to their proximity to the E2 loop: a free region corresponding to extracellular loops, a restrained region in which constraints were applied to preserve the backbone structure corresponding to proximal transmembrane segments, and a fixed region encompassing all remaining residues. The topallhdg force field was used in conjunction with a simple quartic repulsion potential (26Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). In the first stage of the protocol, the structures were submitted to 5 ps of restrained molecular dynamics at 1000 K. The force constants of the distance and dihedral angle restraints were linearly increased in 20 steps, while the nonbonded repulsive potential was kept to a low value. The force constants of the terms maintaining the disulfide bond between Cys105 and Cys180 were set to zero to allow a better sampling of the conformational space. In the second stage, the force constants maintaining the covalent geometry of the Cys105–Cys180 disulfide bridge were increased linearly in 20 steps during 10 ps of dynamics. The third stage comprised 10 ps of molecular dynamics during which the nonbonded repulsive potential was gradually increased. The structures were then cooled down from 1000 to 0 K over a period of 20 ps. Finally, the structures were energy-minimized using the CHARMM 22 force field with a Lennard-Jones potential and a distance-dependent dielectric function for the electrostatic term. The photoreactive analog [BAPA0,(p-Bz)Phe8]SP binds NK-1M and NK-1m binding sites with nanomolar affinities similar to those of SP for rat or human NK-1 receptor expressed in CHO cells (Table I). This analog also activates with potencies similar to those of SP the phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase second messenger pathways (Table I). In CHO cells expressing the human NK-1 receptor, the photoactivatable C-terminal analog, [BAPA-Lys6,(p-Bz)Phe8,Pro9,Met(O2)11]SP-(7–11), had a 4-fold better affinity for the less abundant NK-1m binding site than the NK-1m selective ligand, propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP-(7–11)] (Table I). The affinity of [BAPA-Lys6,(p-Bz)Phe8,Pro9,Met(O2)11]SP-(7–11) for the more abundant NK-1M binding site was also increased 70-fold compared with propionyl[Met(O2)11]SP-(7–11). As expected (8Sagan S.

https://openalex.org/W2086304484,"The tumor suppressor gene, MMAC/PTEN, has phosphatase, C2, and PDZ-binding domains as well as potential sites of regulation by phosphorylation, including tyrosine phosphorylation, which may contribute to its ability to modulate cell growth and viability. Several obvious and significant motifs were found in MMAC/PTEN, including most notably, a catalytic domain of tyrosine phosphatase (IHCxxGxxRS/T) and several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. To examine the functional significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of MMAC/PTEN, retroviral constructs were generated with mutations at two putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Y240A/Y240F and Y315A/Y315F). Stable expression of wild-type MMAC/PTEN in U251 human glioma cells (which do not normally produce a functional MMAC/PTEN gene product) resulted in a significant reduction of tumor growth in nude mice, decreased growth rate, saturation density, and colony formation in vitro, as well as dephosphorylation of D3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols (PtdIns) in vitro. Mutation of Y240 or Y315 to either alanine or phenylalanine abrogated the ability of MMAC/PTEN to alter growth rate, saturation density, and colony formation in vitro. The ability of MMAC/PTEN to limit tumor growth in nude mice was markedly decreased but not abrogated by mutation of Y240 or Y315 to alanine. Thus, Y240 and Y315 are required for MMAC/PTEN to decrease tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to wild-type MMAC/PTEN, mutant MMAC/PTEN containing Y240A or Y315A was unable to dephosphorylate D3-phosphorylated PtdIns in vitro. Thus, Y240A and Y315A are involved in the ability of MMAC/PTEN to dephosphorylate PtdIns and regulate tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1995998542,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) regulates various physiological and developmental processes in concert with other growth factors, cytokines and hormones. We examined interactions between cell signaling events elicited by HGF and the cytokine interleukin (IL)-4, in the IL-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32D transfected with the human HGF receptor, c-Met. HGF was a potent mitogen in these cells, and prevented apoptosis in response to IL-3 withdrawal. IL-4 showed modest anti-apoptotic activity, but no significant mitogenic activity. IL-4 synergistically enhanced HGF-stimulated DNA synthesis, whereas only additive prevention of apoptosis was observed. IL-4 did not enhance HGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met or Shc. In contrast, HGF-stimulated activation of MAP kinases was enhanced by IL-4, suggesting that the IL-4 and HGF signaling pathways converge upstream of these events. Although phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors diminished HGF-induced mitogenesis, anti-apoptosis, and MAP kinase activation, IL-4 enhanced HGF signaling persisted even in the presence of these inhibitors. IL-4 enhancement of HGF signaling was partially blocked in 32D/c-Met cells treated with inhibitors of MEK1 or c-Src kinases, completely blocked by expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of Janus kinase 3 (Jak3), and increased in 32D/c-Met cells overexpressing STAT6. Our results suggest that the IL-4 and HGF pathways converge at multiple levels, and that IL-4-dependent Jak3 and STAT6 activities modulate signaling events independent of PI3K to enhance HGF-dependent mitogenesis in myeloid cells, and possibly other common cellular targets."
https://openalex.org/W1975010050,"We have analysed the radiation response of a human medullary thyroid carcinoma cell line (MTT), characterized by the absence of a functional p53 protein, and the consequences of MDM2 overexpression in this process. We show that the product of the mdm2 proto-oncogene is able to sensitize MTT cells to ionizing radiation. After radiation treatment, MTT cells display histograms consistent with a G2M arrest. MTT cells expressing MDM2 (MTT-mdm2) are unable to respond to DNA damage with G2M arrest, and display a high percentage of apoptosis. MTT-mdm2 cells show high levels of E2F-1 protein, suggesting that the induction of apoptosis observed upon MDM2 overexpression could be dependent on E2F-1. This observation is further supported with assays showing that E2F-1 binding to specific DNA sequences is enhanced in MTT-mdm2 cells. Likewise, transactivation of reporter constructs exclusively dependent on E2F-1 is also elevated after transfection with MDM2. This effect can be reverted by transient transfection with p19ARF. To link the expression of E2F-1 with the induction of apoptosis, we generated clonal cell lines overexpressing E2F-1. Transfection with E2F-1 results in a low number of outgrowing colonies with reduced proliferation rates, indicating that E2F-1 is deleterious for cell growth. This negative regulation correlates with an increase in the percentage of the cell population with DNA content below 2N, suggesting that E2F-1 promotes apoptosis. Finally, overexpression of E2F-1 sensitizes MTT cells to radiation exposure. We conclude that the effects observed by MDM2 overexpression could be mediated by E2F-1."
