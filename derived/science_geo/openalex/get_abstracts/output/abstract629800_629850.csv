https://openalex.org/W2924760942,"The Hayabusa2 spacecraft arrived at the near-Earth carbonaceous asteroid 162173 Ryugu in 2018. We present Hayabusa2 observations of Ryugu's shape, mass, and geomorphology. Ryugu has an oblate ""spinning top"" shape, with a prominent circular equatorial ridge. Its bulk density, 1.19 ± 0.02 grams per cubic centimeter, indicates a high-porosity (>50%) interior. Large surface boulders suggest a rubble-pile structure. Surface slope analysis shows Ryugu's shape may have been produced from having once spun at twice the current rate. Coupled with the observed global material homogeneity, this suggests that Ryugu was reshaped by centrifugally induced deformation during a period of rapid rotation. From these remote-sensing investigations, we identified a suitable sample collection site on the equatorial ridge."
https://openalex.org/W2922553715,"NASA’S Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft recently arrived at the near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu, a primitive body that represents the objects that may have brought prebiotic molecules and volatiles such as water to Earth1. Bennu is a low-albedo B-type asteroid2 that has been linked to organic-rich hydrated carbonaceous chondrites3. Such meteorites are altered by ejection from their parent body and contaminated by atmospheric entry and terrestrial microbes. Therefore, the primary mission objective is to return a sample of Bennu to Earth that is pristine—that is, not affected by these processes4. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft carries a sophisticated suite of instruments to characterize Bennu’s global properties, support the selection of a sampling site and document that site at a sub-centimetre scale5–11. Here we consider early OSIRIS-REx observations of Bennu to understand how the asteroid’s properties compare to pre-encounter expectations and to assess the prospects for sample return. The bulk composition of Bennu appears to be hydrated and volatile-rich, as expected. However, in contrast to pre-encounter modelling of Bennu’s thermal inertia12 and radar polarization ratios13—which indicated a generally smooth surface covered by centimetre-scale particles—resolved imaging reveals an unexpected surficial diversity. The albedo, texture, particle size and roughness are beyond the spacecraft design specifications. On the basis of our pre-encounter knowledge, we developed a sampling strategy to target 50-metre-diameter patches of loose regolith with grain sizes smaller than two centimetres4. We observe only a small number of apparently hazard-free regions, of the order of 5 to 20 metres in extent, the sampling of which poses a substantial challenge to mission success. Observations of asteroid (101955) Bennu with NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft reveal an unexpected surficial diversity that poses a challenge to the success of the sample-return mission."

https://openalex.org/W2950019155,"The Canary Islands' indigenous people have been the subject of substantial archaeological, anthropological, linguistic and genetic research pointing to a most probable North African Berber source. However, neither agreement about the exact point of origin nor a model for the indigenous colonization of the islands has been established. To shed light on these questions, we analyzed 48 ancient mitogenomes from 25 archaeological sites from the seven main islands. Most lineages observed in the ancient samples have a Mediterranean distribution, and belong to lineages associated with the Neolithic expansion in the Near East and Europe (T2c, J2a, X3a…). This phylogeographic analysis of Canarian ancient mitogenomes, the first of its kind, shows that some lineages are restricted to Central North Africa (H1cf, J2a2d and T2c1d3), while others have a wider distribution, including both West and Central North Africa, and, in some cases, Europe and the Near East (U6a1a1, U6a7a1, U6b, X3a, U6c1). In addition, we identify four new Canarian-specific lineages (H1e1a9, H4a1e, J2a2d1a and L3b1a12) whose coalescence dates correlate with the estimated time for the colonization of the islands (1st millennia CE). Additionally, we observe an asymmetrical distribution of mtDNA haplogroups in the ancient population, with certain haplogroups appearing more frequently in the islands closer to the continent. This reinforces results based on modern mtDNA and Y-chromosome data, and archaeological evidence suggesting the existence of two distinct migrations. Comparisons between insular populations show that some populations had high genetic diversity, while others were probably affected by genetic drift and/or bottlenecks. In spite of observing interinsular differences in the survival of indigenous lineages, modern populations, with the sole exception of La Gomera, are homogenous across the islands, supporting the theory of extensive human mobility after the European conquest."
https://openalex.org/W2923773231,"Physiological signals may be used as objective markers to identify emotions, which play relevant roles in social and daily life. To measure these signals, the use of contact-free techniques, such as Infrared Thermal Imaging (IRTI), is indispensable to individuals who have sensory sensitivity. The goal of this study is to propose an experimental design to analyze five emotions (disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) from facial thermal images of typically developing (TD) children aged 7-11 years using emissivity variation, as recorded by IRTI. For the emotion analysis, a dataset considered emotional dimensions (valence and arousal), facial bilateral sides and emotion classification accuracy. The results evidence the efficiency of the experimental design with interesting findings, such as the correlation between the valence and the thermal decrement in nose; disgust and happiness as potent triggers of facial emissivity variations; and significant emissivity variations in nose, cheeks and periorbital regions associated with different emotions. Moreover, facial thermal asymmetry was revealed with a distinct thermal tendency in the cheeks, and classification accuracy reached a mean value greater than 85%. From the results, the emissivity variations were an efficient marker to analyze emotions in facial thermal images, and IRTI was confirmed to be an outstanding technique to study emotions. This study contributes a robust dataset to analyze the emotions of 7-11-year-old TD children, an age range for which there is a gap in the literature."

https://openalex.org/W2924546941,"We test and compare different incentives in motivating water conservation using a randomized controlled trial. In a field experiment carried out with Singaporean households, regular feedback was given, with informative, normative and monetary incentives provided to different groups. Evidence shows that all households saved an average of 4 Litres of water per person per day, with no difference in treatment effect found across various groups. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the water saving effect is also found to be more significant with high baseline users, who saved up to 5.9 Litres per person per day. High baseline households also respond more positively to the non-monetary incentives."
https://openalex.org/W2949080798,"The U.S. art museum sector is grappling with diversity. While previous work has investigated the demographic diversity of museum staffs and visitors, the diversity of artists in their collections has remained unreported. We conduct the first large-scale study of artist diversity in museums. By scraping the public online catalogs of 18 major U.S. museums, deploying a sample of 10,000 artist records comprising over 9,000 unique artists to crowdsourcing, and analyzing 45,000 responses, we infer artist genders, ethnicities, geographic origins, and birth decades. Our results are threefold. First, we provide estimates of gender and ethnic diversity at each museum, and overall, we find that 85% of artists are white and 87% are men. Second, we identify museums that are outliers, having significantly higher or lower representation of certain demographic groups than the rest of the pool. Third, we find that the relationship between museum collection mission and artist diversity is weak, suggesting that a museum wishing to increase diversity might do so without changing its emphases on specific time periods and regions. Our methodology can be used to broadly and efficiently assess diversity in other fields."
https://openalex.org/W2924196690,"Effects of fungicide treatments on non-target fungi in the phyllosphere are not well known. We studied community composition and dynamics of target (Puccinia striiformis) and non-target fungi in wheat that was heavily infected with yellow rust. Mycobiotas in bulk leaf samples and individual leaves were studied by metabarcoding targeting the internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS1) region of the ribosomal DNA. The amount of yellow rust in individual samples was quantified by qPCR (quantitative PCR). In addition, septoria tritici blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici), powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis), tan spot (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis), and yellow rust (P. striiformis) were visually evaluated. We showed how fungal communities were affected by three different broad-spectrum fungicides that had been applied at different timings and doses to control Puccinia striiformis. We showed that fungal content was relatively constant even after fungicide treatments. Principal component analysis demonstrated that communities from fungicide-treated plots could be separated from the communities in non-treated plots. We observed effects of fungicide treatments on fungal communities using different dose, timing and products. Some fungi, including the target organism P. striiformis were effectively controlled by most of the fungicide applications whereas some yeasts and also P. tritici-repentis increased after treatments. We demonstrated the feasibility of using metabarcoding as a supplement to visual assessments of fungicide effects on target as well as non-target fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2924911537,"The use of wrist-worn accelerometers has recently gained tremendous interest among researchers and clinicians as an objective tool to quantify real-world use of the upper limbs during the performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). However, wrist-worn accelerometers have shown a number of limitations that hinder their adoption in the clinic. Among others, the inability of wrist-worn accelerometers to capture hand and finger movements is particularly relevant to monitoring the performance of ADLs. This study investigates the use of finger-worn accelerometers to capture both gross arm and fine hand movements for the assessment of real-world upper-limb use. A system of finger-worn accelerometers was utilized to monitor eighteen neurologically intact young adults while performing nine motor tasks in a laboratory setting. The system was also used to monitor eighteen subjects during the day time of a day in a free-living setting. A novel measure of real-world upper-limb function—comparing the duration of activities of the two limbs—was derived to identify which upper limb subjects predominantly used to perform ADLs. Two validated handedness self-reports, namely the Waterloo Handedness Questionnaire and the Fazio Laterality Inventory, were collected to assess convergent validity. The analysis of the data recorded in the laboratory showed that the proposed measure of upper-limb function is suitable to accurately detect unilateral vs. bilateral use of the upper limbs, including both gross arm movements and fine hand movements. When applied to recordings collected in a free-living setting, the proposed measure showed high correlation with self-reported handedness indices (i.e., ρ = 0.78 with the Waterloo Handedness Questionnaire scores and ρ = 0.77 with the Fazio Laterality Inventory scores). The results herein presented establish face and convergent validity of the proposed measure of real-world upper-limb function derived using data collected by means of finger-worn accelerometers."
https://openalex.org/W2924182083,"Distant metastasis leads oral cancer patients into a poor survival rate and a high recurrence stage. During tumor progression, dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to involve tumor initiation and modulate oral cancer malignancy. MiR-450a was significantly upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients without functional reports. This study was attempted to uncover the molecular mechanism of novel miR-450a in OSCC. Mir-450a expression was examined by quantitative RT-PCR, both in OSCC cell lines and patients. Specific target of miR-450a was determined by software prediction, luciferase reporter assay, and correlation with target protein expression. The functions of miR-450a and TMEM182 were accessed by adhesion and transwell invasion analyses. Determination of the expression and cellular localization of TMEM182 was examined by RT-PCR and by immunofluorescence staining. The signaling pathways involved in regulation of miR-450a were investigated using the kinase inhibitors. Overexpression of miR-450a in OSCC cells impaired cell adhesion ability and induced invasiveness, which demonstrated the functional role of miR-450a as an onco-miRNA. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)-mediated expression of TMEM182 was regulated by miR-450a induction. MiR-450a-reduced cellular adhesion was abolished by TMEM182 restoration. Furthermore, the oncogenic activity of TNF-α/miR-450a/TMEM182 axis was primarily through activating extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway. ERK1/2 inhibitor prevented the TNF-α-induced miR-450a expression and enhanced adhesion ability. Our data suggested that TNF-α-induced ERK1/2-dependent miR-450a against TMEM182 expression exerted a great influence on increasing OSCC motility. Overall, our results provide novel molecular insights into how TNF-α contributes to oral carcinogenesis through miR-450a that targets TMEM182."
https://openalex.org/W2925149138,"Introduction Worldwide, there are between 50–67 million migrant domestic workers, the majority of whom are women. In many countries, provisions are not in place to protect female migrant domestic workers. These women may be at risk of occupational and social stressors, including exploitation and abuse, which may negatively impact on their quality of life, including psychological health. Research examining the occupational, social, and psychological needs of FMDWs from a public health perspective is critical to guide the development of policies which ensure wellbeing, prevent abuse, and align with international priorities to improve population health. Though there have been a number of high-profile incidents of exploitation and abuse, there has been limited research on the stressors experienced by these communities, their perceived impact, or coping mechanisms. Materials and methods Thematic analysis was used to analyse qualitative free-text written responses collected as part of a cross-sectional survey on the relationship between social and occupational stressors and the health and quality of life of FMDWs in Singapore. Responses correspond to open-ended questions in the qualitative component of the survey examining three domains: causes of stress, coping strategies, and what people can do to help with stress. Results Responses from 182 FMDWs were analysed. Key themes were identified around causes of stress (including ‘work and agency’, ‘the pervasiveness of financial need’, and ‘family and obligation’), coping strategies, and social support. Each theme describes key factors which contribute to the occupational and social stressors experienced and reported by FMDWs. Discussion This research highlights the stressors FMDWs in Singapore experience, as well as key coping mechanisms. There is a clear need for policies which facilitate FMDWs’ ability to utilise these coping resources, and which protect against coercive or exploitative employment conditions. Strategies are also needed to monitor and evaluate policies intended to protect FMDWs, and to strengthen the implementation of global frameworks targeted at improving workplace conditions and workers’ rights."
https://openalex.org/W2923079276,"This study aimed to identify the differentiating parameters of the spinal curves’ 2D projections through a hierarchical classification of the 3D spinal curve in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). A total number of 103 right thoracic left lumbar pre-operative AIS patients were included retrospectively and consecutively. A total number of 20 non-scoliotic adolescents were included as the control group. All patients had biplanar X-rays and 3D reconstructions of the spine. The 3D spinal curve was calculated by interpolating the center of vertebrae and was isotropically normalized. A hierarchical classification of the normalized spinal curves was developed to group the patients based on the similarity of their 3D spinal curve. The spinal curves’ 2D projections and clinical spinal measurements in the three anatomical planes were then statistically compared between these groups and between the scoliotic subtypes and the non-scoliotic controls. A total of 5 patient groups of right thoracic left lumbar AIS patients were identified. The characteristics of the posterior-anterior and sagittal views of the spines were: Type 1: Normal sagittal profile and S shape axial view. T1 is leveled or tilted to the right in the posterior view. Type 2: Hypokyphotic and a V shape axial view. T1 is tilted to the left in the posterior view. Type 3: Hypokyphotic (only T5-T10) and frontal imbalance, S shape axial view. T1 is leveled or tilted to the right, and 3 frontal curves. Type 4: Flat sagittal profile (T1-L2), slight frontal imbalance with a V shape axial view, T1 tilted to the left. Type 5: flat sagittal profile and forward trunk shift with a proximal kyphosis and S shape axial view. T1 is leveled or tilted to the right. In conclusion, a hierarchical classification of the 3D scoliotic spine allowed identifying various distinguishing features of the spinal curves in patients with a right thoracic curve in an orderly fashion. The subtypes’ characteristics resulting from this 3D classification can be identified from the pairs of the frontal and sagittal spinal curves i.e. X-rays in right thoracic AIS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2924165092,"Low birth weight at birth is an important underlying contributor for neonatal and infant mortality. It accounts for nearly half of all perinatal deaths. Identifying predictors of low birth weight is the first essential step in designing appropriate management strategies. Hence, this study aimed to identify risk factors for low birth weight in hospitals of northeastern Ethiopia.An institution based case-control study design was conducted from 10th April to 15th December 2016. Three hundred sixty mother-infant pairs (120 low birth weight babies as cases and 240 normal birth weights as controls) were included in the study. Data were collected by face-to-face interview. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were computed to examine the effect of independent variables on outcome variable using SPSS 20.0. Variables with p-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant.The mean (±SD) gestational age and birth weight (±SD) were 39.2 (±1.38) weeks and 2800 (±612), grams respectively. Partner's education/being illiterate (AOR: 4.09; 95% CI 1.45, 11.50), antenatal care visit at private health institutions (AOR: 0.13; 95% CI 0.02, 0.66), having history of obstetric complications (AOR: 5.70; 95% CI 2.38, 13.63), maternal weight during pregnancy (AOR: 4.04; 95% CI 1.50, 10.84) and gravidity (AOR: 0.36; 95% CI 0.18, 0.73) were significantly associated with low birth weight. Additionally, a site for water storage and water treatment were significant environmental factors.Maternal weight during pregnancy, paternal education, previous obstetric complication and place of antenatal follow-up were associated with low birth weight. The risk factors identified in this study are preventable. Thus, nutritional counseling, health education on improvement of lifestyle and early recognition and treatment of complications are the recommended interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2924142746,"Background International guidelines lack a substantial consensus regarding management of asymptomatic full-term and late preterm neonates at risk for early-onset disease (EOS). Large cohorts of newborns are suitable to increase the understanding of the safety and efficacy of a given strategy. Methods This is a prospective, area-based, cohort study involving regional birth facilities of Emilia-Romagna (Italy). We compared cases of EOS (at or above 35 weeks’ gestation) registered in 2003–2009 (baseline period: 266,646 LBs) and in 2010–2016, after introduction of a new strategy (serial physical examinations, SPEs) for managing asymptomatic neonates at risk for EOS (intervention period: 265,508 LBs). Results There were 108 cases of EOS (baseline period, n = 60; intervention period, n = 48). Twenty-two (20.4%) remained asymptomatic through the first 72 hours of life, whereas 86 (79.6%) developed symptoms, in most cases (52/86, 60.5%) at birth or within 6 hours. The median age at presentation was significantly earlier in the intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP)-exposed than in the IAP-unexposed neonates (0 hours, IQR 0.0000–0.0000 vs 6 hours, IQR 0.0000–15.0000, p<0.001). High number of neonates (n = 531) asymptomatic at birth, exposed to intrapartum fever, should be treated empirically for each newborn who subsequently develops sepsis. IAP exposed neonates increased (12% vs 33%, p = 0.01), age at presentation decreased (median 6 vs 1 hours, p = 0.01), whereas meningitis, mechanical ventilation and mortality did not change in baseline vs intervention period. After implementing the SPEs, no cases had adverse outcomes due to the strategy, and no cases developed severe disease after 6 hours of life. Conclusions Infants with EOS exposed to IAP developed symptoms at birth in almost all cases, and those who appeared well at birth had a very low chance of having EOS. The risk of EOS in neonates (asymptomatic at birth) exposed to intrapartum fever was low. Although definite conclusions on causation are lacking, our data support SPEs of asymptomatic newborns at risk for EOS. SPEs seems a safe and effective alternative to laboratory screening and empirical antibiotic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2922673144,"Vascular aging has a strong relationship with cardiovascular disease. Fos-related antigen 1 (Fra-1), also referred to as Fos-like antigen 1, is a transcription factor and has been reported to be involved in many pathologic processes. Here, we demonstrate that Fra-1 plays a critical role in angiotensin II (Ang II)—induced vascular senescence. Fra-1 expression is increased significantly in Ang II—induced rat aortic endothelial cell (RAEC) senescence and the arteries from Ang II—infused mice. Interestingly, silencing Fra-1 blocks Ang II—induced senescence phenotypes in RAECs, including decreased senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining, and mitigated proliferation suppression and senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Further, knocking down Fra-1 inhibits vascular aging phenotypes in an Ang II—infused mice model. The up-regulated Fra-1 also exists in human atherosclerotic plaques and Ang II—induced vascular smooth muscle cells as well as in replicated senescence RAECs. Mechanistic studies reveal that Fra-1 preferentially associates with c-Jun and binds to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (p21) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a (p16) promoter region, leading to elevated gene expression, which causes senescence-related phenotypes. In conclusion, our results identify that Fra-1 plays a novel and key role in promoting vascular aging by directly binding and transcriptionally activating p21 and p16 signaling, suggesting intervention of Fra-1 is a potential strategy for preventing aging-associated cardiovascular disorders.—Yang, D., Xiao, C., Long, F., Wu, W., Huang, M., Qu, L., Liu, X., Zhu, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2923199262,"Planning the learning task is one of the principal actions that a teacher should engage in, and it is important to know how teachers in the pre-service phase plan learning and communication tasks and the feedback that they use in the classroom. The aim of the present study was twofold: i) to characterize the learning tasks designed by the pre-service physical education teachers; and ii) to identify the relationships between the variables that define the learning tasks and the phases into which a session is structured in Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE) in the pre-service phase. The sample comprised 695 learning tasks designed by fourteen pre-service phase teachers. The independent variable was the lesson structure and the dependent variables were the learning means, the game situation, the game phase, the space where the students practice, the use of the ball in the task, and the kind of feedback provided in the learning tasks. The high predominance of exercises, unspecific games, and no opponent situations, coupled with the low percentage of reflexive feedback, indicates that the pre-service teachers give prevalence to technical over tactical learning. In addition, pre-service teachers show preferences for some of the task characteristics for each part of the lesson structure. Teachers in PETE pre-service phase tasks tend to follow a more traditional methodology, despite having received information about the different methods of sports teaching in their initial training. The current findings seems to indicate a resistance to changing a traditional model for other models centered on game comprehension."
https://openalex.org/W2923430613,"Taxation policies can explain the differences in countries' capacity to produce and export more sophisticated products. We develop a theoretical model considering elements from standard models of economic growth to highlight that a country's productive structure is implied by the appropriate fiscal policy that is necessary for the development of sophisticated products. We show that economies that rely less on capital relative to labor taxation tend to produce more complex products, while countries that rely more heavily on capital relative to labor taxation produce simple products. These relationships remain robust across alternative econometric specifications. Furthermore, we demonstrate the differential effect of a country's level of economic development on the nexus between the structure of taxation and economic sophistication. We show that the negative impact of capital taxes on economic sophistication becomes stronger for countries that are more developed."
https://openalex.org/W2923233903,"In order to solve the problem of labor shortage in double-season rice production areas, machine transplanting, as opposed to manual transplanting, has become the more popular alternative method in rice cultivation. However, the most existing late rice cultivars are not suitable for machine double-season rice cultivation due to their long duration of growth. Therefore, based on the previous studies we chose early season rice cultivars to meet the needs of machine double-season rice cultivation. In this study, field experiments were conducted during the late season in 2015 and 2016 in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, China. Grain yield and yield-related traits were compared among eight early-season cultivars (Liangyou 6, Lingliangyou 211, Lingliangyou 268, Zhuliangyou 819, Xiangzaoxian 32, Xiangzaoxian 42, Zhongjiazao 17, and Zhongzao 39) in 2015 and four cultivars (Lingliangyou 268, Zhuliangyou 819, Zhongjiazao 17, and Zhongzao 39) in 2016, selected from the highest yielding cultivars grown in 2015. Lingliangyou 268 produced 8-44% higher grain yield than did the other cultivars except Zhongjiazao17 in 2015. This higher grain yield was driven by grain weight and aboveground biomass. The greater aboveground biomass in Lingliangyou 268 was mainly attributed to higher apparent radiation use efficiency (aboveground biomass/incident solar radiation). Our study suggests that improvement in grain weight and apparent radiation use efficiency were critical to the high grain yield of early-season rice cultivars grown in late season under machine transplanting conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2923589214,"We investigated the variability in ammonia oxidation (AO) rates and the presence of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria (AOB and AOA) over an annual cycle in the water column of a small, seasonnally ice covered, temperate shield lake. AO, the first step of nitrification, was measured in situ using 15N-labelled ammonium (NH4+) at 1% and 10% of photosynthetic active radiation during day and at the same depths during night. AO was active across seasons and light levels, ranging from undetectable to 333 nmol L-1 d-1 with peak activity in winter under ice cover. NH4+ concentration was the single most important positive predictor of AO rates. High NH4+ concentrations and reduced chlorophyll a concentrations under ice, which favoured AO, were coherent with high nitrate concentrations and super saturation in nitrous oxide. When targeting the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene in samples from the photic zone, we found AOA to be omnipresent throughout the year while AOB were observed predominantly during winter. Our results demonstrate that AO is an ongoing process in sunlit surface waters of temperate lakes and at all seasons with pronounced nitrification activity observed during winter under ice. The combination of high NH4+ concentrations due to fall overturn, reduced light availability that limited phytoplankton competition, and the presence of AOB together with AOA apparently favoured these elevated rates under ice. We suggest that lake ice could be a control point for nitrification in oligotrophic temperate shield lakes, characterized as a moment and place that exerts disproportionate influence on the biogeochemical behaviour of ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2924170274,"Background Breast cancer is common among Ghanaian women. Late stage presentation has been credited to knowledge deficit and lack of breast cancer prevention and early detection services for women. Objective This study aimed to develop a model to facilitate the integration of breast cancer prevention and early detection into cancer palliative care Method This study used synthesized concepts emerging from a single case study research. The case was a tertiary health care facility, embedded with sub-units of analysis. Mixed-method approach was used to collect data from 102 participants. The study examined the experiences and views of the participants on breast cancer and screening pathways in Ghana. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics ware used to analyze the qualitative and quantitative data respectively. This was followed with a cross-case analysis across the sub-units of analysis. A theory development approach was further used towards the development of a model, following three steps: concept analysis, statement synthesis and theory synthesis. Results Six key concepts synthesized from the data were used to develop the model: initiate and sustain breast cancer prevention and early detection program, collaboration of health professionals, patients, families and micro-communities, conducive environment of the health care facility and needed resources, actions, services, and lastly diffusing innovation into the community through agents. Conclusion A model has been developed based on the experiences shared by women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer, their first degree relatives, micro-communities as well as clinicians working in a palliative care setting. This model will aid clinicians to provide breast cancer education, teach breast self-examination and offer clinical breast examination to families and micro-communities of advanced breast cancer patients receiving supportive care in a resource-limited setting."

Recently, Tabak and colleagues have contested our previous data that EGF stimulation can induce GALNTs relocation. Here, we show that relocation induced by EGF is actually detectable in the very images acquired by Tabak et al. Furthermore, we show that over-expression of EGFR strongly enhances EGF-induced relocation and that EGFR appears required to drive relocation induced by ERK8 depletion. Direct co-localisation of GALNT with the ER marker Calnexin is observed after EGF stimulation. We furthermore propose that quantification of O-glycosylation of the ER resident protein PDIA4 provides a mean to quantify GALA independently of imaging. In sum, we demonstrate that the claimed non-reproducibility was due to experimental imaging conditions, that EGFR is indeed a driver of GALA and propose additional markers to facilitate the study of this pathway."

Ceramide is produced through three major pathways: a de novo synthesis pathway catalyzed by ceramide synthases, a salvage pathway wherein sphingoid bases are recycled to make ceramide, and a hydrolytic pathway, predominantly catalyzed by sphingomyelinases (SMases). 2The abbreviations used are:SMasesphingomyelinasenSMase2neutral SMase-2PSphosphatidylserineSAXSsmall angle X-ray scatteringHDX-MShydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometrySMsphingomyelinAPLanionic phospholipidPAphosphatidic acidNTDN-terminal domainJXjuxtamembrane regionCATcatalytic domainHS1hydrophobic segment 1HS2hydrophobic segment 2NTD-JXconstruct containing N-terminal domain and juxtamembrane regionJX-CATconstruct containing juxtamembrane region and catalytic domainβ-galβ-galactosidaseEVempty vectorNUbN-terminal end of ubiquitinNUbIisoleucine substituted at position 3 making NUb constitutively activeFLfull-lengthHUhydroxyureaDOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineDOPS1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serineβ-MEβ-mercaptoethanolAβamyloid β-peptideODoptical density. sphingomyelinase neutral SMase-2 phosphatidylserine small angle X-ray scattering hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry sphingomyelin anionic phospholipid phosphatidic acid N-terminal domain juxtamembrane region catalytic domain hydrophobic segment 1 hydrophobic segment 2 construct containing N-terminal domain and juxtamembrane region construct containing juxtamembrane region and catalytic domain β-galactosidase empty vector N-terminal end of ubiquitin isoleucine substituted at position 3 making NUb constitutively active full-length hydroxyurea 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine β-mercaptoethanol amyloid β-peptide optical density. SMases are phosphodiesterases that generate ceramide by hydrolyzing sphingomyelin (SM) and releasing a phosphocholine moiety as byproduct. They are broadly classified, based on their pH optima, into acid sphingomyelinases, neutral sphingomyelinases (nSMases), and alkaline sphingomyelinases. nSMases are further classified into anionic phospholipid (APL)-independent nSMase1, APL-dependent nSMase2, a Bovine nSMase3, and a mitochondria-associated nSMase4. nSMase2 has been widely studied for its roles in cell growth, stress responses, and exosome release (11Kong J.N.

Biochemical studies of nSMase2 have shown that its full activation requires Mg2+ and APLs such as PS and phosphatidic acid (PA). nSMase2 has an N-terminal domain (NTD) that aids in APL binding, followed by a cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region (JX), an insertion region, and a catalytic domain (CAT) (Fig. 1A). The NTD contains two hydrophobic segments, HS1 and HS2, that are important for APL-mediated allosteric activation of nSMase2. The first APL-binding site is between HS1 and HS2 on nSMase2, and the second APL-binding site includes a portion of the JX region (13Shanbhogue P. Hannun Y.A.

The first crystal structure of the CAT domain of human nSMase2 was recently determined at 1.85 Å resolution, presumably in a low-activity state (Fig. 1B) (20Airola M.V. Shanbhogue P. Shamseddine A.A.

Additionally, a loop in the CAT called the “DK loop” was shown to play a role in activation of nSMase2 by acting as a gatekeeper loop (20Airola M.V. Shanbhogue P. Shamseddine A.A. Guja K.E. Senkal C.E. Maini R. Bartke N. Wu B.X. Obeid L.M. Garcia-Diaz M. Hannun Y.A. Structure of human nSMase2 reveals an interdomain allosteric activation mechanism for ceramide generation.Proc. Natl.

However, we did not understand how PS binding by the NTD and JX regions resulted in allosteric activation of the CAT. Here, we present extensive data to demonstrate that the JX region acts as a molecular scaffold, mediating a large conformational change upon PS binding and also effectively participating in activation of nSMase2 via a network of interdomain interactions essential to maintain the active conformation of nSMase2. Moreover, we also elucidate the importance of these interdomain interactions in nSMase2 function. Previous data on the mechanism of nSMase2 activation revealed that activation of this enzyme involves interaction of the CAT domain with the NTD (20Airola M.V. Shanbhogue P. Shamseddine A.A. Guja K.E. Senkal C.E. Maini R. Bartke N. Wu B.X. Obeid L.M. Garcia-Diaz M. Hannun Y.A. Structure of human nSMase2 reveals an interdomain allosteric activation mechanism for ceramide generation.Proc.

To further characterize the mechanism of activation, a split ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid system was developed with the CAT domain as bait and the NTD or NTD-JX domain as prey to determine the residues that play a role in this intramolecular interaction (Fig. 1C). This method relies on the fact that an interaction between bait and prey proteins results in reconstitution of ubiquitin, which is further recognized by cytosolic deubiquitinases. This results in proteolytic release of a transcription factor (LexA-VP16) that facilitates β-gal production, which can then be measured as a readout of interdomain interactions (21Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. A genetic system based on split-ubiquitin for the analysis of interactions between membrane proteins in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95 (9560251): 5187-519210.1073/pnas.95.9.5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The well-established SV40 Large T antigen (as bait)–p53 (as prey) interaction was used as a positive control to test this system (Fig. 1D). Replacing either bait or prey with the corresponding empty vectors (pDHB1 or pPR3N) resulted in no β-gal production (Fig. 1D). Additional controls for validation of bait and prey were included to ensure elimination of false-positives. A self-inducing prey, NUbI was co-expressed with the CAT domain of nSMase2 as bait, resulting in a strong positive interaction. NTD-JX as prey was also tested against the bait vector pDHB1, resulting in no β-gal production. Expression of the constructs is shown in Fig. 1E. With these controls established, the results showed significant interaction between the NTD-JX (amino acids 1–104 and 1–118) and the CAT domains, as seen before (20Airola M.V. Shanbhogue P. Shamseddine A.A. Guja K.E. Senkal C.E. Maini R. Bartke N. Wu B.X. Obeid L.M. Garcia-Diaz M. Hannun Y.A. Structure of human nSMase2 reveals an interdomain allosteric activation mechanism for ceramide generation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Importantly, the current data showed that deletion of the JX region led to a complete loss of interaction between the CAT domain and the membrane-inserted NTD (amino acids 1–84) despite higher expression of NTD (Fig. 1, D and E), indicating a necessary role for the JX region. The results suggest that the first 20 residues of the JX region (amino acids 85–104) are necessary for the interaction with the CAT domain to take place. Therefore, these results define a critical role for the JX region in the interaction with the catalytic domain. To point out specific residues in the JX region that may be interacting with the CAT domain, a multiple sequence alignment of the JX region was performed. The alignment revealed that several amino acids were conserved across multiple species in the minimum sequence (residues 85–104) required for interactions between NTD-JX and CAT. Therefore, alanine scanning was performed across this conserved JX patch in the NTD-JX to define the residues that may play a role in interacting with the CAT domain (Fig. 2A). To rule out expression effects on interdomain interactions, Western blotting of these constructs is shown in Fig. 2E. Mutation of NTD-JX residues Leu-88, Gln-89, Pro-94, and Tyr-95 to alanine showed similar interaction strength as the WT NTD-JX, indicating that these residues do not play a role in interacting with CAT domain. Mutation of NTD-JX residues Arg-92–Arg-93 or Tyr-97 to alanine led to a significant decrease in interaction, suggesting that these residues play a role in interacting with the CAT domain. Interestingly, mutation of residues Trp-85 and Pro-87 to alanine increased the relative strength of interaction (Fig. 2B). We attributed this increase to reduced steric hindrance at these amino acid positions, aiding interdomain interactions. Removal of a bulky side chain in the Trp or any kinks that may be caused by the Pro possibly brought the cytoplasmic section of nSMase2 closer to the NTD, thus aiding stronger interactions. Together, these results indicate that residues Arg-92–Arg-93 and Tyr-97 in the JX region are important for interaction with the CAT domain. The membrane facing side of the CAT domain is most likely to participate in interdomain interactions with the JX domain because it too must lie close to the membrane. To define the interaction partners of the JX residues with the CAT domain, we performed an alanine scan of amino acids in four loops facing the membrane: the palmitoylation loop, DK loop, activation loop, and short loop (Fig. 2C). The orientation of the CAT domain in relation to the membrane was previously discussed by our group (20Airola M.V. Shanbhogue P. Shamseddine A.A. Guja K.E. Senkal C.E. Maini R. Bartke N. Wu B.X. Obeid L.M. Garcia-Diaz M. Hannun Y.A. Structure of human nSMase2 reveals an interdomain allosteric activation mechanism for ceramide generation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28652336): E5549-E555810.1073/pnas.1705134114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Co-expression of NTD as prey and the CAT domain as bait was used as a negative control, and the interaction between NTD-JX as prey and CAT domain as bait was used as positive control. Mutation of residues in the activation loop (termed appropriately due to its active role in nSMase2 activation) of the CAT domain to alanine resulted in a decrease in interdomain interaction, suggesting residues N142AN143A and Leu-144 (despite its higher expression level) in this loop as the major interacting partners of the JX region (Fig. 2D). Mutations in residues Asn-428 and Asp-429 in the DK loop also resulted in a slight decrease in the relative strength of interdomain interactions. These data are consistent with the previously described model wherein a conformational change of this loop or “DK switch” needs to occur for activation of nSMase2. Mutations in the palmitoylation loop (L386AY387A and D388A V389A) and in the short loop (F400AK401A) did not show a difference in the relative strength of the interaction as compared with the WT NTD-JX construct and therefore do not appear to play a role in interactions between NTD-JX and CAT domains. Expression of the constructs is shown in Fig. 2E. These results identify residues N142AN143A and Leu-144 in the activation loop as important to mediate the interaction with the JX region. A comparison of activity between the CAT, JX-CAT domains, and full-length (FL) nSMase2 constructs revealed that although tethering of the JX region to CAT is sufficient for activation by PS, the activity of the JX-CAT construct is only ∼25% of the FL construct (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we hypothesized that the JX region may be mediating interactions between the NTD and CAT by also making important contacts with the NTD for maximal activation of the enzyme. To explore this, we again used the membrane split ubiquitin system, but in this case with NTD as prey and JX tethered to CAT (JX-CAT) as bait (Fig. 3B). Tethering JX to NTD (as NTD-JX) or to CAT (as JX-CAT) resulted in domain–domain interactions between NTD and CAT via the JX region. This suggests that the JX region acts as a bridge or a scaffold between the membrane-inserted NTD and the cytoplasmic CAT domains, making interactions with both domains. To determine the specific amino acids that play a role in the JX-NTD interaction, point mutations of conserved residues in the JX region (Fig. 2A) were made in the JX-CAT construct and used as bait to probe against the prey, NTD. When vector pPR3N was used as prey and tested against JX-CAT as bait, no interaction was seen, thus ensuring no false positives. The positive control for the system was the self-inducing prey, NUbI, with JX-CAT as bait that resulted in a strong increase in β-gal activity. When JX-CAT WT was used as bait against NTD as prey, as expected, there was an increase in β-gal activity, which was abolished when JX-CAT was replaced with CAT as bait (Fig. 3C). Mutation of JX residues Leu-88, Gln-89, Pro-94, and Tyr-95 to alanine did not show a significant decrease in β-gal activity, thus indicating that they are not involved in interactions between NTD and JX-CAT. However, mutation of residues Trp-85, Pro-87, Arg-92–Arg-93, and Tyr-97 resulted in a significant decrease in β-gal activity, thus indicating that they play a role in interacting with the NTD (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, Arg-92 and Arg-93 were important for both sets of interactions (JX with NTD and JX with CAT). From previous studies, we know that these two arginines play a role in PS binding (18Wu B.X. Clarke C.J. Matmati N. Montefusco D. Bartke N. Hannun Y.A. Identification of novel anionic phospholipid binding domains in neutral sphingomyelinase 2 with selective binding preference.J. Biol.

Therefore, this suggests that domain–domain interactions might be occurring as a consequence of PS binding. Expression levels of constructs do not contribute to differences in interdomain interactions as depicted in Fig. 3E. Therefore, these results show that specific amino acid residues in the JX region play a role in interacting with the membrane-inserted NTD. To determine the amino acids in the NTD that play a role in interacting with JX-CAT, point mutations in the conserved amino acid residues in the region between the two hydrophobic segments were made, including amino acids previously identified to be important for PS binding. This comes from a previous topological study of nSMase2 (22Tani M. Hannun Y.A. Analysis of membrane topology of neutral sphingomyelinase 2.FEBS Lett. 2007; 581 (17349629): 1323-132810.1016/j.febslet.2007.02.046Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Again, NUbI (prey)–CAT (bait) or NUbI (prey)–JX-CAT (bait) pairs were used as positive controls, and EV or NTD against CAT were used as negative controls. Conserved residues Thr-41 and Glu-44 showed very little change in β-gal activity, thus indicating that they play no role in interacting with the cytoplasmic section of nSMase2 (Fig. 3D). Residues Asp-32 and Leu-34 showed a decrease in β-gal activity. Amino acids previously recognized as important for PS activation of nSMase2, Arg-33, and the cationic patch KRQR (residues 45–48) (18Wu B.X. Clarke C.J. Matmati N. Montefusco D. Bartke N. Hannun Y.A.

Taken together, these results indicate that residues Asp-32 and Leu-34 in addition to PS-binding residues (Arg-33 and Lys-45–Arg-46–Gln-47–Arg-48) are involved in domain–domain interactions with the CAT. To determine whether a loss of interaction between the NTD and CAT domains via the JX region indeed leads to a loss of nSMase2 activation, the effects of JX point mutations W85A, Y97A, R92AR93A; CAT domain mutations N142A, N143A, and L144A (in the activation loop); and NTD mutations D32A, R33A, L34A, and KRQR 45–48A in full-length nSMase2 were tested. The activity assay was performed by quantifying the hydrolysis of 14C-labeled SM in mixed micelles (“Experimental procedures”). JX mutations W85A and Y97A drastically reduced the Vmax by ∼85%, whereas mutating residues Arg-92 and Arg-93 reduced the Vmax by 30% (Fig. 4A). The CAT activation loop residues, N142A, N143A, and L144A also showed a decrease in Vmax of ∼80% (Fig. 4A). NTD mutations D32A and Leu-34 showed a complete loss of nSMase2 activity, and as previously shown, residues R33A and the cationic patch residues (KRQR 45–48) showed complete reduction in nSMase2 activity (Fig. 4A) (18Wu B.X.

Mutating conserved residue Phe-400 did not result in a significant decrease in activity as compared with WT nSMase2, thus indicating that the loss of nSMase2 activity is due to a loss in interdomain interactions (Fig. 4A). To ensure that the loss of activity of nSMase2 is not due to loss of protein fold, we ran nSMase WT and nSMase2 mutant (containing all mutations involved in interdomain interaction) constructs on Phyre2 application (23Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J. Protein structure prediction on the Web: a case study using the Phyre server.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 (19247286): 363-37110.1038/nprot.2009.2Crossref PubMed Scopus (3553) Google Scholar). Comparison of WT and mutant nSMase2 constructs revealed no changes in secondary structure elements in mutated regions (Figs. S1 and S2). To confirm these results experimentally, we performed CD of CAT WT and JX-CAT WT with some representative mutations (CAT D430A, CAT N142AN143A, CAT L144A, JX-CAT W85A, JX-CAT R92AR93A, and JX-CAT Y97A). The spectra of CAT domain constructs look similar to those of previously published bacterial sphingomyelinases (24de Andrade S.A. Pedrosa M.F. de Andrade R.M. Oliva M.L. van den Berg C.W. Tambourgi D.V. Conformational changes of Loxosceles venom sphingomyelinases monitored by circular dichroism.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, we checked the thermal stability of CAT WT and JX-CAT WT with some representative mutations (CAT D430A, CAT N142AN143A, CAT L144A, JX-CAT W85A, JX-CAT R92AR93A, and JX-CAT Y97A) from the yeast two-hybrid screen using SYPRO orange dye with a temperature gradient from 25 to 95 °C. No significant changes in melting temperatures were observed between WT and mutational constructs (Fig. S4). These results indicated that the loss in nSMase2 activity in these mutant constructs were not due to a loss of secondary structural elements but could be due to a loss of interdomain interactions. To establish whether a loss of allosteric activation of nSMase2 via the JX region affects its function in cells, the sensitivity of the JK9-3d yeast strain to the genotoxic agent hydroxyurea (HU) was tested. As previously established, the JK9-3d strain lacking the yeast homolog of nSMase2 (Isc1) showed a clear sensitivity to HU. This phenotype was rescued with overexpression of human WT nSMase2 in these cells (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, when human nSMase2 was overexpressed with mutations relating to interdomain interactions such as Trp-85, R92AR93A, and Tyr-97 in the JX region, activation loop mutations in the CAT domain such as N142A, N143A, and L144A, or NTD mutations such as D32A, R33A, L34A, and KR"

As such, it has been suggested that eEF2K inhibitors could hold therapeutic potential to treat some cancers while exerting minimal on-target side effects. eukaryotic elongation factor 2 eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase pulsed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture heat-shock protein 90 mouse embryonic fibroblast isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside 2-deoxyglucose mTOR complex 1 Western blot real-time quantitative RT-PCR firefly luciferase propidium iodide. Notably, we recently reported that accelerated translation rates lead to enhanced levels of translation errors and that eEF2K serves to ensure accurate protein synthesis (6Xie J. de Souza Alves V. von der Haar T.

In this study, using pulsed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (pSILAC) combined with LC-MS/MS analysis, we discovered that knocking down or deleting eEF2K in cells increases the translational efficiencies of HSP90 mRNAs. This may help cells to cope with higher levels of erroneously translated and thus misfolded proteins. Strikingly, inhibition of HSP90 in eEF2K-null cells evoked apoptosis under conditions of proteolytic stress, suggesting that concomitant inhibition of HSP90 and eEF2K is detrimental to (cancer) cell survival. To assess whether eEF2K affects the synthesis of specific proteins under metabolic stress conditions, we applied pSILAC (7Huo Y. Iadevaia V. Yao Z. Kelly I. Cosulich S. Guichard S. Foster L.J. Proud C.G. Stable isotope-labelling analysis of the impact of inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin on protein synthesis.Biochem.

A549 cells expressing an isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against EEF2K were generated and treated with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), a nonmetabolizable glucose analog that induces metabolic stress by inhibiting glycolysis, to activate eEF2K (5Wang X. Xie J. da Mota S.R. Moore C.E. Proud C.G. Regulated stability of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase requires intrinsic but not ongoing activity.Biochem.

They were subsequently incubated in culture medium containing heavy lysine and arginine isotopologs for 2 h to label (“mass-tag”) newly synthesized proteins (Fig. S1A). Proteins were extracted and subjected to trypsin digestion after which the resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Fig. S1B). A total of 3,011 unique proteins were identified, of which the SILAC ratios of 973 proteins could reliably be quantified (see “Experimental procedures” and Table S1). We detected 78 protein groups that differed in their synthesis rates (p value <0.01) upon knockdown of eEF2K (Fig. S1B). Furthermore, synthesis of three members of the heat-shock protein molecular chaperone family (HSPA5, HSP90B1, and HSP90AA1) was up-regulated upon eEF2K knockdown (Fig. S1B). Of note, HSP90 proteins have been shown to interact with eEF2K, resulting in its stabilization (8Yang J. Yang J.M. Iannone M. Shih W.J. Lin Y. Hait W.N. Disruption of the EF-2 kinase/Hsp90 protein complex: a possible mechanism to inhibit glioblastoma by geldanamycin.Cancer Res. 2001; 61 (11358819): 4010-4016PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis confirmed the higher HSP90 protein expression levels in IPTG-treated A549 cells and eEF2K−/− MEFs compared with their vehicle-treated or WT counterparts, by 1.5- and 2.0-fold, respectively. Also consistent with the pSILAC analysis, GAPDH levels were 1.6- and 2.3-fold lower in IPTG-treated A549 and eEF2K−/− MEFs, respectively (Fig. S1, C–E). In contrast, actin levels were unaltered (Fig. 1A). 2-DG treatment also led to a reduction in HSP90 protein levels in MEFs (Fig. 1, D and E) (6Xie J. de Souza Alves V. von der Haar T. O'Keefe L.

Chellini L. Iadevaia V. Proud C.G. Loreni F. Ribosomal stress activates eEF2K-eEF2 pathway causing translation elongation inhibition and recruitment of terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs on polysomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25332393): 12668-1268010.1093/nar/gku996Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that TOP mRNAs (mRNAs that contain a 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract, many of which encode ribosomal proteins and translation factors) are recruited onto polysomes upon activation of eEF2K, thereby causing an increase in the relative synthesis of TOP mRNA–encoded proteins compared with others. This feature was clearly evident in our pSILAC data, in good agreement with the findings of Gismondi et al. (9Gismondi A. Caldarola S. Lisi G. Juli G. Chellini L. Iadevaia V. Proud C.G. Loreni F. Ribosomal stress activates eEF2K-eEF2 pathway causing translation elongation inhibition and recruitment of terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs on polysomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25332393): 12668-1268010.1093/nar/gku996Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), thereby validating our own findings. Higher HSP90 protein levels in eEF2K-null cells were not due to elevated levels of its mRNAs as, if anything, HSP90AA1 and HSP90B1 mRNA levels were slightly lower in eEF2K−/− MEFs (Fig. 2, A and B). To study further how eEF2K regulates HSP90 protein expression, we fractionated lysates from 2-DG–treated eEF2K+/+ and eEF2K−/− MEFs through sucrose gradient profiling (Fig. 2C). 2-DG treatment greatly reduced the proportion of ribosomes in translationally active polysomal fractions (Fig. S2). Interestingly, upon 2-DG–induced eEF2K activation (Fig. 1D), the amounts of HSP90AA1 and HSP90B1 mRNAs associated with active polysomes were higher in eEF2K−/− MEFs than in WT cells, and their association with monosomal or subpolysomal fractions was correspondingly lower (Fig. 2, C–E). In contrast, the distribution of a “control” mRNA, B2M (encoding β2-microglobulin), was essentially unchanged (Fig. 2F). These data indicate that eEF2K negatively regulates the translation of HSP90 mRNAs by impairing the association of their mRNAs with polysomes.Figure 3.AUY922 increases levels of ubiquitinated proteins in 1% (v/v) Triton–insoluble pellets from eEF2K−/− MEFs.

Thus, blocking HSP90 function may be particularly detrimental to protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in cells lacking eEF2K. To test this, we exposed eEF2K+/+ and eEF2K−/− MEFs to MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, in the presence or absence of the HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922 (hereafter called AUY922) (10Eccles S.A. Massey A. Raynaud F.I. Sharp S.Y. Box G. Valenti M. Patterson L. de Haven Brandon A. Gowan S. Boxall F. Aherne W. Rowlands M. Hayes A. Martins V. Urban F. et al.NVP-AUY922: a novel heat shock protein 90 inhibitor active against xenograft tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis.Cancer Res. 2008; 68 (18413753): 2850-286010.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). MG132 evokes phosphorylation of eEF2 (Fig. 3A), indicating activation of eEF2K. Under conditions of impaired protein degradation, ubiquitinated proteins first accumulate in the fraction that is soluble in 1% (v/v) Triton and then aggregate and relocate into the insoluble fraction (11Mimnaugh E.G. Xu W. Vos M. Yuan X. Isaacs J.S. Bisht K.S. Gius D. Neckers L. Simultaneous inhibition of hsp 90 and the proteasome promotes protein ubiquitination, causes endoplasmic reticulum-derived cytosolic vacuolization, and enhances antitumor activity.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3 (15141013): 551-56610.4161/cbt.3.6.846Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As expected, after MG132 treatment, a large quantity of ubiquitinated proteins was found in clarified lysates, and a slight increase in ubiquitinated proteins in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100–insoluble pellets was also observed (Fig. 3, A–C). Inhibiting HSP90 activity by AUY922 increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins in the pellet fraction in eEF2K+/+ MEFs, but the effect was considerably enlarged in eEF2K−/− cells (Fig. 3, A–C), indicating a greater buildup of incorrectly folded proteins. Furthermore, this was accompanied with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage (Fig. 3A), indicating apoptosis (12Gobeil S. Boucher C.C. Nadeau D. Poirier G.G. Characterization of the necrotic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1): implication of lysosomal proteases.Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8 (11536009): 588-59410.1038/sj.cdd.4400851Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We observed a reduction in protein refolding capacity in eEF2K−/− MEF lysates from cells pretreated with MG132 and AUY922 (Fig. 3D), showing that HSP90 inhibition greatly impairs overall chaperone capacity in eEF2K-null cells. We also detected a large increase in early and late apoptotic AUY922-treated eEF2K−/− cells under proteotoxic stress induced by MG132 (Fig. 4), likely reflecting impaired proteostasis. Taken together, these data indicate that when elongation rates are enhanced, subsequent up-regulation of HSP90 chaperone expression plays an important role in maintaining proteostasis. Proteostasis involves tightly-regulated and balanced processes that are essential to cell and organ health span. The processes that modulate proteostasis include the synthesis, maturation, and degradation of proteins. It follows that mRNA translation requires effective mechanisms to ensure the correct folding and assembly of newly synthesized polypeptides into functional proteins; dysregulation of this crucial process in cells contributes to development of protein misfolding disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) among others (13Scheckel C.

Faster elongation will increase the load of newly synthesized polypeptides that need to be properly folded.

However, because translation quantity is inversely related with quality, it is reasonable to speculate that alterations in translation speed and hence accuracy may also impact other proteostasis regulatory mechanisms to ensure proper protein production. Previously, we showed that levels of certain proteins involved in cell migration are decreased upon eEF2K knockdown in A549 cells (17Xie J. Shen K. Lenchine R.V. Gethings L.A. Trim P.J. Snel M.F.

To measure the rates of de novo synthesis at the proteome-wide level, we applied pSILAC (which enables the identification and quantification of newly synthesized proteins). Consistent with results from our study of steady-state protein levels (17Xie J. Shen K. Lenchine R.V. Gethings L.A. Trim P.J. Snel M.F. Zhou Y. Kenney J.W. Kamei M. Kochetkova M. Wang X. Proud C.G. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase upregulates the expression of proteins implicated in cell migration and cancer cell metastasis.Int. J. Cancer. 2018; 142 (29235102): 1865-187710.1002/ijc.31210Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we only observed changes in the synthesis of a small proportion of proteins (78 of the 973 quantifiable proteins) when comparing control and eEF2K knockdown cells (Fig. S1). Among them, levels of HSP90 chaperones were increased in A549 cells upon eEF2K knockdown and in eEF2K−/− MEFs (Fig. 1). This observation, however, was not associated with increases in HSP90 mRNA levels but instead resulted from increased translational efficiency of HSP-encoding mRNAs (HSP90AA1 and HSP90B1) (Fig. 2) overall, ensuring proper protein folding under accelerated rates of translation elongation. The mechanism by which depletion of eEF2K, and thus faster elongation, increases translation of HSP90 mRNAs is not clear. One possibility is that their coding sequences contain rare codons for which levels of the cognate tRNAs are low; this appears not to be the case. Another is that it relates to features of their 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs), regions that often control translation initiation. Notably, the HSP90 5′-UTR is known to possess extensive secondary structure (18Ahmed R. Duncan R.F. Translational regulation of Hsp90 mRNA. AUG-proximal 5′-untranslated region elements essential for preferential heat shock translation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (15347681): 49919-4993010.1074/jbc.M404681200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and may therefore make the translation of their mRNAs more susceptible to modulation during elongation, although the mechanisms that link control of elongation to modulation of initiation remain unclear (see Ref. 19Proud C.G. Phosphorylation and signal transduction pathways in translational control.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2018; (29959191): a03305010.1101/cshperspect.a033050Google Scholar). Conversely, suppressing HSP90 activity using AUY922 led to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 3) in eEF2K−/− cells and to apoptosis (Fig. 4), implying that eEF2K and HSP90 jointly act to maintain proper proteostasis. It has previously been reported that HSP90 physically interacts with eEF2K, and disrupting the HSP90–eEF2K interaction by geldanamycin reduced eEF2K protein levels in glioblastoma cells (8Yang J. Yang J.M. Iannone M. Shih W.J. Lin Y. Hait W.N. Disruption of the EF-2 kinase/Hsp90 protein complex: a possible mechanism to inhibit glioblastoma by geldanamycin.Cancer Res. 2001; 61 (11358819): 4010-4016PubMed Google Scholar), suggestive of the requirement of HSP90 for the proper folding and stability of eEF2K. Thus, eEF2K and chaperones such as HSP90 form a mutually complementary system to ensure proper protein folding and protection of cells against buildup of misfolded polypeptides. Furthermore, given the growing interest in HSP90 and eEF2K inhibitors as anticancer agents, a combination therapy involving both types of inhibitors may offer a promising and effective strategy for therapy of some types of cancer.

We aimed to assess whether the combined use of hyperspectral data with modern marker technology could be used to improve across location pre-harvest yield predictions using different statistical models. A maize bi-parental doubled haploid (DH) population derived from F1, which consisted of 97 lines was evaluated in testcross combination under heat stress as well as combined heat and drought stress during the 2014 and 2016 summer season in Ciudad Obregon, Sonora, Mexico (27°20"" N, 109°54"" W, 38 m asl). Full hyperspectral data, indicative of crop physiological processes at the canopy level, was repeatedly measured throughout the grain filling period and related to grain yield. Partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RR) and Bayesian ridge regression (BayesB) were used to assess prediction accuracies on grain yield within (two-fold cross-validation) and across environments (leave-one-environment-out-cross-validation) using molecular markers (M), hyperspectral data (H) and the combination of both (HM). Highest prediction accuracy for grain yield averaged across within and across location predictions (rGP) were obtained for BayesB followed by RR, RF and PLSR. The combined use of hyperspectral and molecular marker data as input factor on average had higher predictions for grain yield than hyperspectral data or molecular marker data alone. The highest prediction accuracy for grain yield across environments was measured for BayesB when molecular marker data and hyperspectral data were used as input factors, while the highest within environment prediction was obtained when BayesB was used in combination with hyperspectral data. It is discussed how the combined use of hyperspectral data with molecular marker technology could be used to introduce physiological genomic estimated breeding values (PGEBV) as a pre-harvest decision support tool to select genetically superior lines."
https://openalex.org/W2921805483,"Background Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a serious mental health problem that causes significant impairment and reduced quality of life. Though some substantially benefit from psychological therapies, a substantial proportion of people with OCD disengage from treatment or fail to benefit. Theoretical models such as the Common-Sense Model posit that our management of physical illness depends on our perceptions about the condition. Identifying how people with OCD perceive their condition could lead to important insight that would improve treatment of OCD. Objectives To identify and characterise the illness perceptions of people with OCD. Method Transcribed semi-structured interviews exploring the illness perceptions of 16 people with OCD were analysed using thematic analysis. Results In some cases, identification of symptoms was hindered by a failure to interpret experiences as ‘symptoms’. Instead, these individuals interpreted symptoms as a personality quirk, or as evidence that they had become deviant. Perceptions of the condition as ‘part’ of the self contributed to views of OCD as permanent. Individuals were concerned about the impact of OCD on friends and family and attempted to minimise its consequences, for example by concealing symptoms from their children, who they feared could acquire OCD. Conclusion Applying a theoretical model of physical health understanding to OCD yielded novel insights, with important implications for support and treatment. To enable early help-seeking and rapid diagnosis, public and professional knowledge about OCD should be extended beyond ‘washing and checking’ to the less widely known OCD-subtypes, such as fear of causing harm. It may be important to identify and challenge views of OCD as permanent early in the course of treatment to maximise engagement. Management of OCD should also address the burden of living with OCD in a family context. Further research to test whether these perceptions lead to coping responses and outcomes in OCD is now needed."

Based on this model, we design infusion rates of either insulin (monotherapy) or insulin and glucagon (dual therapy) that can optimally maintain the blood glucose level within desired limits after consumption of a meal and prevent the onset of both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. This problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem, which we solve using the numerical optimal control package PSOPT. Interestingly, in the case of monotherapy, we find the optimal solution is close to the standard method of insulin based glucose regulation, which is to assume a variable amount of insulin half an hour before each meal. We also find that the optimal dual therapy (that uses both insulin and glucagon) is better able to regulate glucose as compared to using insulin alone. We also propose an ad-hoc rule for both the dosage and the time of delivery of insulin and glucagon."
https://openalex.org/W2924112790,"We performed phylogeographic and genetic structure analyses of Neothraupis fasciata joined with species distribution modelling to evaluate whether: (1) the distribution of genetic variability shows a pattern expected by the isolation-by-distance model; (2) the influence of the Pleistocene climate changes on species distribution; and (3) climate/climatic stability (hypothesis of climatic stability) as a predictor of population genetic diversity. Based on two molecular datasets (ND2 and FIB-5), the isolation-by-distance hypothesis was not supported. The mitochondrial haplotype network indicated the existence of historically isolated populations at the southern range of the species distribution, and recent population expansion was identified by both neutrality tests and extended Bayesian skyline plot analysis. Thus, the climatic changes during the Pleistocene might have promoted the reconnection of the partially isolated southern populations, which may have persisted in the plateaus during the cycles of savanna contractions. Subsequently, this species (re)colonized northern areas of the species present distribution, following the continuous vegetation on the São Francisco and Central plateaus about 60 kyr, and also reached the Amazonian savannas likely via the central corridor. Thus, our results indicated that the intrinsic relationship between the relief heterogeneity (plateaus and depressions) and the climatic fluctuations, mainly in the Pleistocene, promoted population reconnection and demographic expansion of N. fasciata."
https://openalex.org/W2924282114,"Odontocetes have evolved a rich diversity of prey- and habitat-specific foraging strategies, which allows them to feed opportunistically on locally and temporally abundant prey. While habitat-specific foraging strategies have been documented for some odontocete species, this is less known for the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). We collected multiple years of acoustic data using echolocation click loggers to analyse porpoise occurrence and buzzing behaviour, indicating feeding, in the German Wadden Sea (North Sea). Seasonal, diel and tidal effects were studied using Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE-GAMs). Locally season, time of day and tidal time significantly influenced the probability of porpoise detections and detection of foraging sequences (buzzes). Hunting strategies, and therefore frequency of buzzes, were likely affected by prey distribution and large differences between POD locations indicated that porpoises used highly specific behaviour adapted to tide and time of day to efficiently feed on the available prey. Strong seasonal and spatial variation in diel and tidal effects underline the importance of long-term observations. Studies on porpoise behaviour are often based on short-term observations and might rather reflect a seasonal than a general pattern. The results of this study show clearly that significant changes in porpoise behaviour can be found in short and long-term observations. Here some features are based on short term determinants and others are stable over years and care should be taken about drawing general conclusions based on local patterns. Highly variable spatio-temporal patterns indicate a high flexibility of porpoises in a highly variable environment and address a challenge for complex conservation management plans."
https://openalex.org/W2924547427,"Blood-testis barrier (BTB) and apical ectoplasmic specialization (ES) serve as structural supports for germ cell (GC) development. We demonstrated that the Sertoli cell (SC)-specific coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CXADR) knockout (SC-CXADR−/−), but not the GC-specific knockout, impaired spermatogenesis. An increase in GC apoptosis and premature loss of elongated spermatids were observed in SC-CXADR−/− testes. The BTB function was compromised in SC-CXADR−/− testes with dysregulation of oocludin and zonula occludens-1 expression at the basal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium. An integrated omics analyses confirmed that altered gene ontology terms identified in SC-CXADR−/− testes are highly associated with spermatid development and differentiation, spermatogenesis, and sperm motility and are considered as unique testicular function terms. Leptin, Nasp, Tektin3, Larp 7, and acrosin, which are highly associated with male fertility, were found to be down-regulated in SC-CXADR−/− testes. Based on the data from the omics analyses, we employed the CXADR-deficient SC model to further investigate the molecular mechanisms involved. We unraveled that SC-CXADRs are required for β-catenin inactivation and cell division cycle protein 42 (Cdc42) activation, resulting in maintaining the integrity and function of the BTB and apical ES as well as inhibiting gene transcription, such as the Myc gene, in the testes. We demonstrated for the first time that CXADR is an important mediator governing β-catenin and Cdc42 signaling that is essential for spermatogenesis. The molecular mechanisms identified herein may provide new insights to unravel the novel functions and signaling cascades of CXADR in other key CXADR-expressing tissues.—Huang, K., Ru, B., Zhang, Y., Chan, W.-L., Chow, S.-C., Zhang, J., Lo, C., Lui, W.-Y.

At the beginning of the 2000s, a surveillance system was established in the country, and samples from suspected cases are regularly tested in the laboratory for serological confirmation. Since 2007, when case-by-case monitoring with standardized laboratory databases and monitoring, was set up, no assessment have been performed. Therfore, 9 years later it seemed appropriate to make a first assessment. The aim of the study reported here was to describe the epidemiology of measles in the CAR on the basis of surveillance and laboratory data.A descriptive retrospective study was conducted, based on the databases of the measles surveillance programme and of the Institut Pasteur laboratory in Bangui during the period 2007-2015.During this study period, the surveillance programme notified 3767 cases. Of these, 2795 (75%) were sent for laboratory confirmation, and 24.6% (687/2795) were confirmed serologically. Of the 1797 cases of measles declared during this period by the surveillance programme, 1110 (61.8%) were confirmed clinically or by epidemiological linkage. The majority of confirmed cases (83.7%; 575/687) occurred in children under 10 years, over half of whom (44.2%; 304/687) were aged 1-4 years. Epidemics occurred regularly between 2011 and 2015, with > 10% of laboratory-confirmed cases. The rate of laboratory investigation was < 80% between 2011 and 2013 but nearly 100% in the other years.Measles remains a common, endemic illness in the CAR. Improved detection will require better measles surveillance, increased vaccination coverage, revision of the investigation forms to include the WHO case definition and training of the health personnel involved in case-finding in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2924780342,"Macrophages play a central role in tissue remodeling, repair, and resolution of inflammation. Macrophage polarization to M1 or M2 activation status may determine the progression or resolution of the inflammatory response. We have previously reported that cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) displays both cytoprotective and metabolic activities. The role of CT-1 in inflammation remains poorly understood. Here, we employed recombinant CT-1 (rCT-1) and used CT-1-null mice and myeloid-specific CT-1 transgenic mice to investigate whether CT-1 might play a role in the modulation of the inflammatory response. We observed that CT-1 deficiency was associated with enhanced release of inflammatory mediators and with stronger activation of NF-κB in response to LPS, whereas the inflammatory response was attenuated in CT-1 transgenic mice or by administering rCT-1 to wild-type animals prior to LPS challenge. We found that CT-1 promoted IL-6 expression only by nonhematopoietic cells, whereas LPS up-regulated IL-6 expression in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. Notably, rCT-1 inhibited LPS-mediated soluble IL-6R induction. Using IL-6-/- mice, we showed that rCT-1 inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α and IFN-γ response in an IL-6-independent manner. Importantly, we demonstrated that CT-1 primes macrophages for IL-4-dependent M2 polarization by inducing IL-4 receptor expression. Mechanistic analyses showed that the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 axis mediates this effect. Our findings support the notion that CT-1 is a critical regulator of inflammation and suggest that rCT-1 could be a molecule with potential therapeutic application in inflammatory conditions.-Carneros, D., Santamaría, E.

Daily hospital admissions were compared over 51 days associated with the Asian Games period (Nov 1-Dec 21, 2010) with the identical calendar dates of baseline years (2004-2009 and 2011-2013). A three-year cohort study was conducted with 36 COPD patient participants. The daily particulate matter (PM10) decreased from 65.86 μg/m3 during the baseline period to 62.63 μg/m3 during the Asian Games period; the daily NO2 level decreased from 51.33 μg/m3 to 42.63 μg/m3. Between the baseline period and the Asian Games, daily hospital admissions from non-accidental diseases decreased from 116 to 93, respectively; respiratory diseases decreased from 20 to 17, respectively; and cardiovascular diseases decreased from 11 to 9 during the Asian Games period, respectively. No statistically significant reductions were seen in the remaining months of 2010 in Guangzhou, during the the Asian Games period in the control city, and two other control diseases. Furthermore, we identified significant improvement in CRP and fibrinogen by -20.4% and -15.4% from a pre-Asian game period to a during-Asian game period, respectively. For CRP, we found significant increases in NO2 at lag1-3 days after-Asian game period and significant increases in PM10 at lag1-2 days. Similar effects were also seen with fibrinogen. This discovery provides support for efforts to diminish air pollution and improve public health through human air pollutants intervention. Improved air pollution during the 2010 Asian games was correlated with decreases in biomarkers associated with systemic inflammation in COPD patient participants."

The role of personal and social resources (emotional stability, trait resilience, affect state, and social support) as well as health-related variables (self-rated health, multimorbidity, and psychological comorbidity) in patients' affective well-being was examined by controlling for demographic characteristics using regression analyses.The strength of the inverse correlation between positive and negative affect decreased over time. In addition to health-related variables, higher negative affect was predicted by higher psychological comorbidity over time (T1-T3). In turn, lower positive affect was predicted by lower self-rated health (T1-T2) and higher multimorbidity (T3). In terms of personal and social resources, lower negative affect was predicted by higher emotional stability (T2), whereas higher positive affect was predicted by stronger social support (T1-T2).Knowledge about psychosocial determinants-personal and social resources and health-related variables-of patients' affective well-being following ED admission is essential for designing more effective routine screening and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2923321735,"Dropouts are a common issue in cognitive tests with non-human primates. One main reason for dropouts is that researchers often face a trade-off between obtaining a sufficiently large sample size and logistic restrictions, such as limited access to testing facilities. The commonly-used opportunistic testing approach deals with this trade-off by only testing those individuals who readily participate and complete the cognitive tasks within a given time frame. All other individuals are excluded from further testing and data analysis. However, it is unknown if this approach merely excludes subjects who are not consistently motivated to participate, or if these dropouts systematically differ in cognitive ability. If the latter holds, the selection bias resulting from opportunistic testing would systematically affect performance scores and thus comparisons between individuals and species. We assessed the potential effects of opportunistic testing on cognitive performance in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) with a test battery consisting of six cognitive tests: two inhibition tasks (Detour Reaching and A-not-B), one cognitive flexibility task (Reversal Learning), one quantity discrimination task, and two memory tasks. Importantly, we used a full testing approach in which subjects were given as much time as they required to complete each task. For each task, we then compared the performance of subjects who completed the task within the expected number of testing days with those subjects who needed more testing time. We found that the two groups did not differ in task performance, and therefore opportunistic testing would have been justified without risking biased results. If our findings generalise to other species, maximising sample sizes by only testing consistently motivated subjects will be a valid alternative whenever full testing is not feasible."

In Myanmar, the country met only 62% of its target for the maternal mortality rate (130 per 100,000 live birth) even though proportion of skilled birth attendant (SBA) and antenatal care (ANC) coverage was 80% in 2015. Despite the estimated large maternal complications, most maternal healthcare program ignored the burden of those morbidity because of limited understanding of the incidence and prevalence of morbidity conditions and cost of those morbidity burdens on society. The present study provides a general idea of the scope of obstetric complication, incidence of obstetric complication, and cost of those morbidity burdens on society. We conducted a retrospective incidence-based cost of illness study related to obstetric complication from the healthcare system perspective at 25 bedded township hospital in Yedashae during the fiscal year of 2015-2016. For the cost of obstetric complication, average treatment cost was 26.83 USD (±8.59). When looking by disease category, average treatment cost for incomplete abortion was 35.45 USD (±1.75); pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) was 16.01 USD; pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) was 21.02 USD (±4.68); ante-partum hemorrhage (APH) was 14.24(± 0.25); post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) was 27.04 USD (±1.56); prolonged labor was 37.55 USD (±0.42); and septicemia was 16.51 USD (±2.15). Significant predicting variables in obstetric complication cost model were incomplete abortion, prolonged labor, post-partum hemorrhage (PPH), pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), patient age and septicemia. From this study, we can summarize the most frequently occurred obstetric complication in that township area, actual cost burden of those complications and obstetric complication cost model which can be useful for hospital financial management.

https://openalex.org/W2923725917,"We have developed a protocol for reconstructing 3D models of the skulls of extinct species of small mammals. For the first time, the reconstruction uses fragments of fossils from a mixture of different specimens and from related extant species. We use free software and commercial computers to make the process reproducible and usable for the scientific community. We present a semi-quantitative protocol to face the problem of making 3D reconstructions of fossil species that are incomplete in the fossil record and/or represented by a mixture of different individuals, as usually occurs with small vertebrates. Therefore this approach is useful when no complete skull is available. The protocol combines the use of microCT scan technology with a subsequent computer treatment using different software tools for 3D reconstruction from microCT and 3D design and printing (e.g. Fiji, SPIERS, Meshlab, Meshmixer) in a defined order. This kind of free and relatively simple software, plus the detailed description, makes this protocol practicable for researchers who do not necessarily have great deal of experience in working with 3D. As an example, we have performed virtual reconstructions of the skulls of two species of insectivore small mammals (Eulipotyphla): Beremendia fissidens and Dolinasorex glyphodon. The resulting skulls, plus models of the extant shrews Blarina brevicauda, Neomys fodiens, Crocidura russula and Sorex coronatus, make it possible to compare characteristics that can only be observed by means of microCT 3D reconstructions, and given the characteristics of the material, using this protocol. Among the characters we can compare are the position of the mandibles, the spatial relations among all the teeth, the shape of the snout and, in general, all parameters related with the anatomy of the rostrum. Moreover, these reconstructions can be used in different types of context: for anatomical purposes, especially to see internal features or characteristics at whole-skull scale, for bioengineering, animation, or other techniques that need a digital model."
https://openalex.org/W2923780078,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a known complication of HCM and is a strong predictor of mortality. We aim to investigate the relationship between microvascular dysfunction measured by quantitative PET and PH in HCM patients.Eighty-nine symptomatic HCM patients were included in the study. Each patient underwent two 20-min 13N-NH3 dynamic PET scans for rest and stress conditions, respectively. A 2-tissue irreversible compartmental model was used to fit the segments time activity curves for estimating segmental and global myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR). Echocardiographic derived PASP was utilized to estimate PH.Patients were categorized into two groups across PASP: PH (PASP > 36 mmHg) and no-PH (PASP ≤ 36 mmHg). patients with PH had larger left atrium, ratio of higher inflow early diastole (E) and atrial contraction (A) waves, E/A, and ratio of inflow and peak early diastolic waves, E/e', significantly reduced global stress MBF (1.85 ± 0.52 vs. 2.13 ± 0.56 ml/min/g; p = 0.024) and MFR (2.21 ± 0.57 vs. 2.62 ± 0.75; p = 0.005), while the MBFs at rest between the two groups were similar. There were significant negative correlations between global stress MBF/MFR and PASP (stress MBF: r = -0.23, p = 0.03; MFR: r = -0.32, p = 0.002); for regional MBF and MFR measurements, the highest linear correlation coefficients were observed in the septal wall (stress MBF: r = -0.27, p = 0.01; MFR: r = -0.31, p = 0.003). Global MFR was identified to be independent predictor for PH in multivariate regression analysis.Echocardiography-derived PASP is negatively correlated with global MFR measured by 13N-NH3 dynamic PET. Global MFR is suggested to be an index of PH in HCM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2924352951,"Increasing incidences of dengue have become a global health threat with major clinical manifestation including high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. These symptoms were also expressed among Blastocystis sp. infected individuals, a parasite commonly seen in human stools. This parasite has been previously reported to replicate faster upon exposure to high temperature. The present study is a hospitalized-based cross-sectional study involved the collection of faecal sample from dengue patients. Stool examination was done by in vitro cultivation to isolate Blastocystis sp. Growth pattern of all the positive isolates were analyzed to identify the multiplication rate of Blastocystis sp. isolated from dengue patients. Distribution of Blastocystis sp. among dengue patients was 23.6%. Dengue patients who were positive for Blastocystis sp. infection denoted a significantly higher fever rate reaching 38.73°C (p<0.05) compared to the non-Blastocystis sp. infected patients (38.44°C). It was also found that Blastocystis sp. infected patients complained of frequenting the toilet more than five times a day (p<0.05) compared to those who were non-Blastocystis sp. infected. At the same time, the duration of hospitalization was significantly longer (p<0.05) for Blastocystis sp. infected dengue patients compared to the non-Blastocystis sp. infected patients. Besides, Blastocystis sp. isolated from dengue patients (in vivo thermal stress) showed a higher growth rate compared to the non-dengue isolated which was exposed to high temperature (in vitro thermal stress). Our findings suggest that presence of Blastocystis sp. during dengue infection could trigger the increase of temperature which could be due to highly elevated pro inflammatory cytokines by both parasitic and virus infection. This could justify why the temperature in Blastocystis sp. infected dengue patients is higher compared to the non-Blastocystis sp. infected patients. Higher temperature could have triggered a greater parasite multiplication rate that contributed to the aggravation of the gastrointestinal symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3125665825,"Rigorous impact evaluations on agricultural interventions in the developing world have proliferated in research of recent years. Whereas increased care in causal identification in such analyses is beneficial and has improved the quality of research in this field, much of the literature still fails to investigate the costs needed to achieve any benefits identified. Such understanding, however, would be crucial for drawing policy and programmatic conclusions from the research and for informing the allocation of public investments. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) subjects both the cost side and the effects side of agricultural and rural interventions to technical scrutiny and unifies both sides in order to compare the relative cost-effectiveness of different modalities of a programme, of efforts to reach different target groups, or of efforts to achieve different outcomes. CEAs, while present in the health and education sectors, remain rare in agricultural and rural development research. This study contributes to filling the knowledge gap by conducting CEAs in a particular type of programmatic work in the agricultural sector—namely, interventions conducted as field experiments that bring a gender lens to community-based advisory services in African rural areas. Specifically, we consider two such programmes—one in Mozambique in which such advisory services aim to improve sustainable land management (SLM) practices in agricultural production, and the other in Tanzania to advise farmers on their land rights. Using CEA methods combined with econometric analysis based on randomised controlled trials, we find that the gendered modality is consistently more cost-effective than the basic modality when considering varied outcomes and target groups. However, for any given modality, it is more cost-effective to improve outcomes for men than for women. The structure of costs in the agricultural extension programme further allowed for a simulation of how cost-effectiveness would change if the programme were scaled up geographically. The results show that expansion of the basic modality of the SLM programme leads to improvements in cost-effectiveness, while the gendered modality displays nonlinear changes in cost-effectiveness along the expansion path, first worsening with initial scale-up and subsequently improving with further expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2924885198,"Tree cavities provide a critical resource for cavity-nesting animals, and high quality cavities can be difficult for animals to acquire in habitats where competition is high. We investigated the breeding performance of Lewis's Woodpeckers in three habitat types in British Columbia, Canada in 2013 and 2014. We also assessed whether the number of nest competitors and cavity availability influenced the habitat specific breeding performance of this threatened cavity nesting species. We found that daily nest survival rate was lower in burned habitat (0.15 ± 0.08 (0.05-0.37)) than in live pine (0.72 ± 0.10 (0.51-0.87)) or cottonwood (0.69 ± 0.09 (0.51-0.83)) habitats. However, hatching success (the proportion of eggs that hatch) was lower in live pine habitat (0.59 ± 0.09 95% CI) than burned (0.77 ± 0.19 95% CI) or cottonwood (0.80 ± 0.07 95% CI) habitat, and the fledging success of successful nests in live pine and burned habitat (1.86 ± 0.31 and 1.88 ± 0.59 95% CI, respectively) was slightly lower than in cottonwood habitat (2.61 ± 0.45 95% CI). Consequently, Lewis's Woodpeckers in cottonwood habitat produced more fledglings per nesting attempt (2.05 ± 0.49 95% CI) than in live pine (1.53 ± 0.35 95% CI) or burned (0.79 ± 0.49 95% CI) habitat. Habitats differed in the number of nesting competitors and the number of suitable cavities surrounding active Lewis's Woodpecker nests. Our results showed that cavity density best explained breeding performance differences although the mechanisms remain unclear. There was no evidence that the number of heterospecific nest competitors, including the invasive European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris), explained or influenced Lewis's Woodpecker breeding performance. Cavity density influenced the productivity of successful nests but did not explain habitat differences in hatching success or daily nest survival. Further work is required to understand the mechanistic basis for the habitat specific breeding performance of Lewis's Woodpeckers. Habitat differences in breeding performance in British Columbia are not consistent with those in other regions, highlighting the importance of regionally-specific demographic data for managing species at risk."
https://openalex.org/W2924891107,"Motivation Patients with hematological malignancies are susceptible to life-threatening infections after chemotherapy. The current study aimed to evaluate whether management of such patients in dedicated inpatient and emergency wards could provide superior infection prevention and outcome. Methods We have developed an approach allowing to retrieve infection-related information from unstructured electronic medical records of a tertiary center. Data on 2,330 adults receiving 13,529 chemotherapy treatments for hematological malignancies were identified and assessed. Infection and mortality hazard rates were calculated with multivariate models. Patients were randomly divided into 80:20 training and validation cohorts. To develop patient-tailored risk-prediction models, several machine-learning methods were compared using area under the curve (AUC). Results Of the tested algorithms, the probit model was found to most accurately predict the evaluated hazards and was implemented in an online calculator. The infection-prediction model identified risk factors for infection based on patient characteristics, treatment and history. Observation of patients with a high predicted infection risk in general wards appeared to increase their infection hazard (p = 0.009) compared to similar patients observed in hematology units. The mortality-risk model demonstrated that for infection events starting at home, admission through hematology services was associated with a lower mortality hazard compared to admission through the general emergency department (p = 0.007). Both models show that dedicated hematological facilities and emergency services improve patient outcome post-chemotherapy. The calculated numbers needed to treat were 30.27 and 31.08 for the dedicated emergency and observation facilities, respectively. Infection hazard risks were found to be non-monotonic in time. Conclusions The accuracy of the proposed mortality and infection risk-prediction models was high, with the AUC of 0.74 and 0.83, respectively. Our results demonstrate that temporal assessment of patient risks is feasible. This may enable physicians to move from one-point decision-making to a continuous dynamic observation, allowing a more flexible and patient-tailored admission policy."

Analysis centered on those treated within either three years before or three years after the accreditation of their attending hospitals. The four hospitals analyzed were located in the North, South, West and Center of the country. Information on all medical procedures performed during treatment was drawn from hospital medical records. Information on the socio-demographic characteristics of the patients was obtained by means of face-to-face interviews conducted in their homes.Adherence of physicians to the Guidelines grew by 12.8 percent (from 43.4 to 56.2 percent) after FPGC accreditation (p<0.001) and varied according to the clinical stage of the disease, with much lower levels of adherence observed in the advanced stages (p<0.05).The FPGC strategy increased the adherence of physicians to the Medical-Care Guidelines for Malignant Breast Tumors in Mexico."

https://openalex.org/W2952191021,"To evaluate changes in the macula and peripapillary choroidal area at one year after trabeculectomy in order to determine the effect of intraocular pressure (IOP) changes.This prospective longitudinal study examined 30 eyes of 30 patients with glaucoma that was uncontrolled by medical therapy. At 1 day before and at 1 year after the trabeculectomy surgery, macular and peripapillary choroidal images were recorded by enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT). Luminal and interstitial areas were converted to binary images using the Niblack method. Factors influencing the macular choroidal and peripapillary area were examined by multivariate analysis.After trabeculectomy, the mean IOP was 10.8±3.2 mmHg compared to 17.8±7.2 mmHg at baseline (P < 0.001). The total macular choroidal area after the surgery increased from 317,735±77,380 to 338,120±90,700 μm2, while the interstitial area increased from 108,598±24,502 to 119,172±31,495 μm2 (all P < 0.05). The total peripapillary choroidal area after the surgery also increased from 1,557,487±431,798 to 1,650,253±466,672 μm2, while the interstitial area increased from 689,891±149,476 to 751,816±162,457 μm2 (all P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences observed in the luminal area before and after the surgery. A decrease in the IOP was among the factors associated with the changes in the peripapillary choroidal area.IOP reductions after trabeculectomy led to increases in the macular and peripapillary choroidal areas for at least 1 year postoperative. Increases in the interstitial areas were the primary reason for observed changes in the choroidal area after trabeculectomy."
