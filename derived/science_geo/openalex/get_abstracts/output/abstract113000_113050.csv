https://openalex.org/W2079803201,"The function of neuropeptide Y, one of the most abundant peptide transmitters of the mammalian brain, remains unclear because of a lack of specific receptor antagonists. An antisense oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to the NH2-terminus of the rat Y1 receptor was constructed and added to cultures of rat cortical neurons. This treatment resulted in a reduced density of Y1 (but not Y2) receptors and diminished the decrease in adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) usually seen after Y1 receptor activation. Repeated injection of the same oligodeoxynucleotide into the lateral cerebral ventricle of rats was followed by a similar reduction of cortical Y1 (but not Y2) receptors. Such antisense-treated animals displayed behavioral signs of anxiety. Thus, specific inhibition of neurotransmitter receptor expression can be accomplished in the living brain and demonstrates that altered central neuropeptide Y transmission produces an anxiety-like state."
https://openalex.org/W1517887854,"Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is the enzyme regulating the release of arachidonic acid in most cell types. A high molecular mass, 85-kDa soluble form of PLA2 (cPLA2) has recently been identified, the activity of which is stably increased by stimulation of cells with hormones and growth factors. Growth factor stimulation of cells has been reported to result in increased phosphorylation of cPLA2 on serine residues, but the kinases mediating this effect have not been identified. We report here that human cPLA2 is phosphorylated in vitro by two growth factor-stimulated serine/threonine-specific kinases, p42 MAP kinase and protein kinase C (PKC). Phosphorylation of the cPLA2 enzyme by either kinase results in an increase in catalytic cPLA2-specific activity. Domains of the cPLA2 molecule have been expressed in Escherichia coli, and the fusion proteins purified. PKC and p42 MAP kinase give different patterns of phosphorylation of the recombinantly expressed cPLA2 fragments. p42 MAP kinase selectively phosphorylates the domain of cPLA2 containing a MAP kinase consensus sequence, whereas PKC phosphorylates sites in all three recombinantly expressed domains of the enzyme. Peptide mapping indicates that the site phosphorylated by p42 MAP kinase is different from those phosphorylated by PKC. The combined action of both of these kinases is likely to mediate the effects of growth factor stimulation on arachidonic acid release through the activation of cPLA2."
https://openalex.org/W2000072353,"Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (GG transferase) is a two-component enzyme that attaches 20-carbon isoprenoid groups to cysteine residues in Rab proteins, a family of guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins that regulate vesicular traffic. The mutant gene in human choroideremia, an X-linked form of retinal degeneration, encodes a protein that resembles component A of rat Rab GG transferase. Lymphoblasts from choroideremia subjects showed a marked deficiency in the activity of component A, but not component B, of Rab GG transferase. The deficiency was more pronounced when the substrate was Rab3A, a synaptic vesicle protein, than it was when the substrate was Rab1A, a protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. The data imply the existence of multiple component A proteins, one of which is missing in choroideremia."
https://openalex.org/W1607687225,"A gene, ppx, that encodes a novel exopolyphosphatase of 513 amino acids (58,133 Da) was found downstream of the gene for polyphosphate kinase, ppk. Transcription of the ppx gene depends on the ppk promoters, indicating a polyphosphate (polyP) operon of ppk and ppx. Exopolyphosphatase, purified to homogeneity from overproducing cells, is judged to be a dimer of 58-kDa subunits. Orthophosphate is released processively from the ends of polyP approximately 500 residues long, but chains of approximately 15 residues compete poorly with polyP as substrate; ATP is not a substrate. Mg2+ (1 mM) and a high concentration of K+ (175 mM) support optimal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1513564091,"Two subtilisin-like endoproteases called PC1 and PC2 are distributed in a tissue-specific manner in the pituitary and in the brain. AtT-20 cells and corticotropes of the anterior pituitary express primarily PC1 and perform a limited number of cleavages of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor during biosynthesis. Melanotropes of the intermediate pituitary express both PC1 and PC2 and perform a more extensive set of cleavages during the biosynthetic processing of POMC. To investigate the role of PC2 in the biosynthetic processing of POMC, AtT-20 mouse corticotropes were stably transfected with a full length PC2 cDNA. The AtT-20 cells expressing PC2 acquired the ability to perform all the additional cleavages seen in the intermediate pituitary, but did not acquire the ability to alpha-N-acetylate the product peptides. The kinetics of the earliest steps in biosynthetic processing were unaltered by the expression of PC2, and the changes due to PC2 expression were seen only in the middle and late steps in biosynthetic processing. Thus, both the identity of the final product peptides and the kinetics of the processing steps in the AtT-20 cells expressing PC2 fit the patterns expected for melanotropes of the intermediate pituitary."

https://openalex.org/W1985024007,"Neurotransmitters acting on presynaptic terminals regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity. Because of the difficulty of direct electrophysiological recording from small presynaptic terminals, little is known about the ion channels that mediate these actions or about the mechanisms by which transmitter secretion is altered. The patch-clamp technique is used to show that the predominant inhibitory presynaptic neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), activates a GABAA receptor and gates a chloride channel in the membranes of peptidergic nerve terminals of the posterior pituitary. The opening of a chloride channel by GABA weakly depolarizes the nerve terminal membrane and blocks action potentials. In this way, GABA limits secretion by retarding the spread of excitation into the terminal arborization."
https://openalex.org/W1490805894,"In the mitochondrial inner membrane, cardiolipin is a specific lipid component associated with various protein complexes. The assembly of such complexes has been studied, and it seems that most protein subunits enter the inner membrane from the matrix side, but nothing is known about the path of cardiolipin. In this paper, the topography of cardiolipin biosynthesis is investigated. Cardiolipin synthase, a membrane-bound protein, could not be released by sonication or 1 M KCl. In sucrose density gradient subfractionation, cardiolipin synthase co-migrated with the inner membrane marker cytochrome oxidase. no indication was obtained for a preferential localization of this enzyme at contact sites between the outer and inner membranes. Protease digestion experiments showed that cardiolipin synthase exposed protease-susceptible domains mainly to the matrix side of the inner membrane. In intact mitochondria, the Mn(2+)-dependent stimulation of cardiolipin synthesis was abolished when the Mn2+ influx into the matrix was blocked by ruthenium red. 1-Decanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, a water-soluble inhibitor of cardiolipin synthase, was only effective after disintegration of mitochondria. The metabolic precursor of cardiolipin, CDP-diacylglycerol, was synthesized by an inner membrane enzyme whose protease-susceptible domains were mainly exposed to the matrix side. It is concluded that cardiolipin is synthesized in the inner leaflet of the mitochondrial inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2024675966,"RECOMBINATION between a diffusible reverse transcript and its homologous chromosomal allele has been proposed as a mechanism for the precise removal of introns from DNA and gene conversion of dispersed repeated sequences1,2. We have reported that RNA-mediated recombination occurs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae3. This recombination requires expression of the retrotransposon Ty, and results in intron loss from a plasmid-borne marker gene and the formation of pseudogenes. Because the pseudogenes are embedded in Ty sequences, chromosomal insertion could have been mediated by Ty integrase or by homologous recombination with endogenous Ty sequences. The structure of the chromosomal recombinants and the fact that plasmid and chromosomal recombination can have different requirements demanded a direct demonstration of RNA-mediated gene conversion of a chromosomal allele. Here we report the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of recombination between a reverse transcript and its chromosomal homologue and describe an assay that specifically detects this novel recombination pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1571399565,"Isoforms of heat shock protein (Hsp) 27 were used as intracellular markers to study tumor necrosis factor/interleukin-1 (TNF/IL-1) regulation of protein phosphatases in primary human fibroblasts. These isoforms were rapidly phosphorylated to varying degrees when fibroblasts were treated with either TNF, IL-1, okadaic acid, calyculin A, ARS, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, H2O2, buthionine sulfoximine, N-ethylmaleimide, diethylmaleimide, or iodoacetate. However, inhibitors of protein kinases A and C, tyrosyl protein kinases, and general protein kinases had no effect on the enhanced phosphorylation of these isoforms in TNF, IL-1, okadaic acid, or calyculin A-stimulated cells, suggesting that the activation of protein kinases by itself is insufficient to produce these changes. Isoforms of 32P-labeled Hsp27 were dephosphorylated during cold-chases with excess phosphate in the absence but not in the presence of TNF/IL-1 or inhibitors of protein phosphatases suggesting that inactivation of protein phosphatase(s) plays a role in TNF/IL-1 signal transduction. Assays of phosphatase activity of cytosolic fractions from TNF or okadaic acid treated human fibroblasts showed an inactivation of protein phosphatase activity against the 32P-labeled Hsp27 protein substrates. In vitro assays of partially purified phosphatase activity from primary human fibroblasts with Hsp27 substrate also showed the protein phosphatase activity to be inhibited by ARS. Like okadaic acid, ARS mimics TNF in inducing specific patterns of cellular protein phosphorylation. Taken together these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a SH-dependent protein phosphatase is inactivated during the early events of TNF/IL-1 signal transduction, hence inhibitors of protein phosphatases and SH modifying compounds can mimic the early effects of TNF/IL-1 on cells."
https://openalex.org/W1507666264,"A new cytochrome P-450 enzyme, isolated from Berberis stolonifera plant cell suspension cultures, has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The purified hemoprotein migrated as a single band in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a minimal M(r) = 46,000. The enzyme could be purified to a high specific content of P-450 (18.2 nmol/mg protein) after fast protein liquid chromatofocusing, displaying an isoelectric point of 6.05. Spectral analysis of the homogeneous enzyme showed that it is predominantly low spin in the oxidized state, with a slight red-shifted ferrous carbonyl complex that exhibits a maximum at 452 nm. The purified cytochrome P-450, successfully reconstituted with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, displayed a maximal turnover rate of 50 nmol of substrate/nmol of P-450/min. In the purified and reconstituted form, the enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of three different chiral benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline substrates, namely (S)-coclaurine, (R)-N-methylcoclaurine, and (S)-N-methylcoclaurine, leading to the formation of three distinct dimeric products, (R,S)-berbamunine, (R,S)-2'-norberbamunine, and (R,R)-guattegaumerine, that are also present in the plant cell cultures in vivo. This is the first report of a P-450 enzyme that mediates regio- and stereoselective intermolecular oxidative phenol coupling to furnish natural dimeric compounds. In this catalytic cycle cytochrome P-450 functions as an oxidant in a bisubstrate reaction without transfer of the activated oxygen atom to either of the two chiral substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1545736837,"We have utilized a homologous cell-free mitochondrial protein import system derived from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in addition to performing a series of in vivo experiments in yeast, to investigate the coupling between cytosolic protein synthesis and protein transport into mitochondria. We found that the import of bulk mitochondrial proteins was inhibited in both the homologous in vitro reaction and in vivo upon arrest of cytosolic protein synthesis with the addition of cycloheximide. Tight coupling of synthesis and import was also demonstrated in vivo for the beta subunit of the mitochondrial F1-ATPase. We also investigated the effect of the antifolate methotrexate on the import of a fusion protein consisting of the mitochondrial targeting signal of yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit IV fused to mouse dihydrofolate reductase (the COXIV-DHFR fusion protein). Methotrexate has previously been shown to inhibit posttranslational import of COXIV-DHFR by preventing the DHFR moiety from unfolding. However, we found that antifolate addition had no inhibitory effect on the import of COXIV-DHFR in vivo, suggesting that its import into mitochondria in yeast cells occurs cotranslationally. Further, when we treated yeast with the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone to collapse the mitochondrial membrane potential and induce the accumulation of extramitochondrial precursor pools, we found that the ability to be imported by a strictly posttranslational mechanism upon reestablishing the membrane potential varied from one precursor to another, suggesting that cotranslational import may be mandatory for the import of some proteins in vivo. In summary, our findings are entirely consistent with the notion that import of proteins into yeast mitochondria occurs cotranslationally under normal conditions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2137670899,"Respiring mitochondria drive the electrophoretic uptake of K+ and other cations. In the presence of permeant acids this transport leads to mitochondrial swelling if it is not compensated by electroneutral K+/H+ exchange mediated by the K+/H+ antiporter. The mechanism of influx has yet to be established; however, evidence is accumulating that in addition to leak pathways a specific K+ channel or uniporter may be involved. We examine some of the properties of K+ uniport which are consistent with the existence of a specific ATP-regulated K+ channel. In contrast to the K+/H+ antiporter, K+ uniport shows little dependence on pH. K+ uniport is, however, very sensitive to inhibition by adenine nucleotides. The maximum percent inhibition is increased from 40 to 60% by treatment of mitochondria with N-ethylmaleimide (30 nmol/mg) which stimulates K+ uniport 3.6-fold. N-Ethylmaleimide, however, has no effect on the IC50 values which are 0.5, 2.3, and 8 microM for ADP, ATP, and AMP, respectively. GDP has no effect, while carboxyatractyloside is found to inhibit. The nucleotide analogs Cibacron blue 3GA and erythrosin B exhibit three effects on K+ uniport. Low doses partially inhibit K uniport (I50 = 0.13 microM Cibacron Blue), while higher doses stimulate (EC50 = 13 microM Cibacron Blue). Stimulation is especially apparent in N-ethylmaleimide-treated mitochondria. These analogs also antagonize inhibition by ATP. Since the EC50 values for this antagonism for these two drugs are similar, while the IC50 values for inhibition of ATP transport differ by a factor of five, we suggest that inhibition of K+ uniport by ATP is not mediated via the adenine nucleotide translocase. These data are consistent with the existence of an ATP-regulated K+ channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1612998887,"We have recently reported that the platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor undergoes polyubiquitination as a consequence of ligand binding and that a mutant beta-receptor lacking the carboxyl-terminal 98 amino acid residues of the receptor (CT98 mutant) does not undergo this posttranslational modification (Mori, S., Heldin, C.-H., and Claesson-Welsh, L. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 6429-6434). In this paper, we report that a mutant beta-receptor in which the carboxyl-terminally located Tyr-1009 and Tyr-1021, which are potential autophosphorylation sites, were simultaneously changed to phenylalanine residues by site-directed mutagenesis (Y1009F/Y1021F mutant) showed only 15% efficiency in ligand-induced ubiquitination compared with the wild-type receptor. Ligand-stimulated degradation of the receptor-bound ligand, as well as of the receptor itself, was partially impaired in the cells expressing the ubiquitination-deficient receptor mutants (CT98 and Y1009F/Y1021F). Furthermore, the ubiquitination-deficient receptors possessed an amplified mitogenic activity, as judged by a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. These data suggest that ligand-induced ubiquitination plays a negative regulatory role in mitogenic signaling of the platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor, possibly by promoting the efficient degradation of the ligand-activated receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1514376968,"The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) origin binding protein, the product of the UL9 gene, catalyzes the unwinding of DNA in the 3‘-5‘ direction. Helicase activity is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP or dATP and to a lesser extent to CTP, dCTP, or UTP. It requires a divalent cation (Mg2+ > Mn2+ > Ca2+) with an optimum at 2.5 mM MgCl2. Activity is optimal at high pH (8.5-9.5) and high temperature (45 degrees C) and is inhibited at ionic strengths > 50 mM NaCl. The helicase activity is specifically stimulated by the HSV-1-encoded single-stranded DNA-binding protein, ICP8, which increases both the rate and extent of helicase activity. Helicase action appears to be stoichiometric, requiring a DNA-dependent assembly of a multimeric UL9 protein complex. Under optimal conditions, the rate of DNA unwinding is approximately 75 base pairs/min."
https://openalex.org/W1553241112,"Abstract Binding of precursors to import receptors on the mitochondrial surface is one of the earliest steps of protein import into mitochondria. In yeast, one of these receptors is a 70-kDa outer membrane protein termed Mas70p. Pulse-chase studies with intact yeast cells had indicated that Mas70p accelerates the import of all mitochondrial precursors tested. In contrast, import experiments with isolated mitochondria suggested that Mas70p accelerated import of only a subset of precursors (Hines, V., Brandt, A., Griffiths, G., Horstmann, H., Brutsch, H., and Schatz, G. (1990) EMBO J. 9, 3191-3200). To resolve this discrepancy, we have now studied the interaction of Mas70p-deficient and wild-type yeast mitochondria with a precursor (pre-alcohol dehydrogenase III) whose import into isolated mitochondria is not accelerated by Mas70p under the usual assay conditions. Mas70p enhanced binding of pre-alcohol dehydrogenase III to the surface of mitochondria in which the electrochemical potential across the inner membrane had been dissipated by an uncoupler; the bound precursor could be efficiently chased into the mitochondria if the potential was restored. The precursor to cytochrome c1 was also bound to mitochondria in a Mas70p-dependent manner. Mas70p also enhanced the direct import of pre-alcohol dehydrogenase III into isolated mitochondria, provided the precursor was first denatured with urea. Under these conditions, the import rate in vitro was more similar to that in intact cells. Mas70p had no effect on the binding or the import of artificial precursors containing mouse dihydrofolate as the mature domain. We conclude that Mas70p is an import receptor for most, if not all authentic mitochondrial precursor proteins, but that its function is not always rate-limiting in import experiments with isolated mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1569610549,"Deciphering the roles of the individual subunits of the heteromeric Na,K-ATPase in the structure, function, and assembly of this enzyme has been complicated because most expression systems have endogenous levels of Na,K-ATPase activity. This problem has become even more significant in light of the recent identification of multiple isoforms for both the alpha and beta subunits. The baculovirus expression system, which uses the baculovirus Autographica californica to infect insect cells, affords two distinct advantages for the expression of the Na,K-ATPase; some insect cells have little or no levels of Na,K-ATPase, and baculovirus-infected cells produce extremely high levels of foreign protein. We have made two separate recombinant baculoviruses containing the rodent alpha 1 or beta 1 cDNAs and used them to infect the insect cell line Sf-9. The infected Sf-9 cells produce Na,K-ATPase subunit protein on the order of 5-10 micrograms of protein/ml of cultured cells. The rodent alpha 1 polypeptide produced in the Sf-9 cells is indistinguishable electrophoretically and antigenically from the native subunit. The expressed beta 1 subunit is also antigenically identical but has a higher electrophoretic mobility due to differential glycosylation by the infected Sf-9 cell. In contrast to other systems, when expressed alone, each individual Na,K-ATPase subunit is targeted to the infected Sf-9 plasma membrane. In contrast, when infected with a virus that induces the heavy chain of murine IgG, the infected Sf-9 cell retains the polypeptide in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, when both IgG light and heavy chains are expressed, the polypeptides are properly processed and secreted. When the Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 and beta 1 polypeptides are simultaneously expressed, they form detergent-resistant complexes that are functional. Ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity on the order of 5 mumol Pi/mg/h in infected Sf-9 membranes was dependent on the expression of both the alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits. Sodium-dependent phosphorylated intermediates were detected that were potassium- and ouabain-sensitive. No increase in ouabain-sensitive activity or phosphorylated intermediates was detected when either subunit was expressed alone. The alpha 1 beta 1-coinfected cells were also able to transport ions, as detected in 86Rb uptake experiments. Thus, the recombinant Na,K-ATPase expressed in insect cells is biologically active and is suitable for structural and functional analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1943019773,"The subcellular distribution in rat liver and the topography in intracellular and plasma membranes of connexin 32, a major protein component of gap junctions, was studied using sequence-specific anti-peptide antibodies generated to extracellular and intracellular domains of the protein. The distribution of connexin 32 in liver analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting showed the relative protein levels in the subcellular fractions to be: lateral plasma membranes > Golgi membranes > sinusoidal plasma membranes > lysosomes. Low amounts of connexin 32 were detected in microsomes, endosomes, and bile canalicular plasma membranes. Six highly conserved cysteine residues are located in the amino acid sequences comprising the two extracellular loops of all connexins thus far isolated, and these loops are positioned to extend the channel in the lipid bilayers across the intercellular region of the gap junction. In the present work, the intramolecular disulfide bonds linking the extracellular loops in gap junctions were shown to be present in connexins located in plasma membranes, Golgi, and a microsomal fraction, and it was concluded that the disulfide linkages were formed in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, immature configurations of connexin 32, probably occurring during membrane insertion, were detected in liver microsomal fractions. The results contribute to charting of the biogenetic routes followed by connexins in hepatocytes and the general mechanisms of gap junction assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1586201322,"Abstract Topoisomerase II (Top II) is the target enzyme for many antineoplastic drugs such as epipodophyllotoxins, anthracyclines, and acridines. Cell lines with alterations in Top II are resistant to drugs that interact with the enzyme. Studies of the Top II from a Chinese hamster ovary line, VpmR-5, that is resistant to VP-16 and VM-26, demonstrated that it is very similar, qualitatively and quantitatively, to its normal counterpart except that DNA cleavage by the VpmR-5 enzyme is not stimulated by VP-16 or VM-26. To understand the basis for the drug-resistant phenotype, the Top II cDNAs were isolated from both Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and VpmR-5 cells by cDNA cloning with lambda gt22, and the entire cDNAs were sequenced. A mutation of G-->A at nucleotide 1478 was the only alteration observed in the VpmR-5 Top II cDNA compared with the wild-type gene. The mutation in VpmR-5 was confirmed by sequencing DNA fragments amplified from the genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. Southern blot hybridization analysis of genomic DNA demonstrated loss of a Top II allele in VpmR-5 probably occurred during the development of resistance to etoposide. The mutation in VpmR-5 changes amino acid 493 from arginine to glutamine and is located adjacent to a putative ATP binding site of Top II. Mutations in an analogous region have been identified in two human leukemia cell lines by amplification of segments of Top II cDNA with Taq DNA polymerase. Taken together, these observations suggest that mutations in this region of the gyrase B domain of mammalian topoisomerase II may be capable of conferring resistance to antineoplastic agents that interact with this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1492592675,"The serpin-enzyme complex (SEC) receptor recognizes a pentapeptide neo-domain of alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1 AT)-elastase complexes and, in so doing, mediates internalization and intracellular catabolism of the macromolecular complex, mediates an increase in synthesis of alpha 1 AT, and elicits neutrophil chemotactic activity. In previous studies we have shown that this pentapeptide domain is highly conserved among members of the serpin family and that binding of a synthetic peptide corresponding to this region (125I-peptide 105Y, SIP-PEVKFNKPFVYLI, based on alpha 1 AT sequence 359-374) to HepG2 cells is blocked by several serpin-enzyme complexes. To determine whether the SEC receptor is the primary HepG2 cell surface binding site for these serpin-enzyme complexes, we examined the capacity for serpin-enzyme complexes to compete with each other for binding to the SEC receptor. The results indicate that binding of 125I-elastase-alpha 1 AT complexes is blocked by thrombin-antithrombin III (ATIII), thrombin-heparin cofactor II, and cathepsin G-alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (alpha 1 ACT) complexes. Moreover, unlabeled elastase-alpha 1 AT complexes compete for binding of 125I-thrombin-ATIII, 125I-thrombin-heparin cofactor II, and 125I-cathepsin G-alpha 1 ACT complexes. Preformed soluble tissue plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 complexes also compete for binding of elastase-alpha 1 AT complexes to the SEC receptor but do so to a less effective extent, probably because of a less favorable pentapeptide sequence for binding to the SEC receptor. Under conditions in which these serpin-enzyme complexes would be expected to bind to the SEC receptor there is an increase in synthesis of alpha 1 AT but not in synthesis of ATIII or alpha 1 ACT. Proteolytically modified alpha 1 AT also competes for binding of 125I-elastase-alpha 1 AT complexes to the SEC receptor and vice versa. The purified 51-kDa amino-terminal fragment of alpha 1 AT does not compete for binding of 125I-elastase-alpha 1 AT complexes, indicating that the pentapeptide neodomain in the 4-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment is sufficient for binding to the SEC receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1587490975,"Studies are described that allow for the in vivo detection of helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein-protein interaction. The assay used requires HLH protein-protein interaction to reconstitute a functional GAL4 transcriptional activator, which in turn activates a reporter gene placed downstream of GAL4 DNA binding sequences. Using this assay, we are able to detect intracellular heterodimerization but not homodimerization of the MyoD, E12, and Id gene products. In addition, using this system we are unable to detect stable heterodimerization between MyoD and c-Jun. We also show that expression of activated rasH gene product does not inhibit and may stabilize HLH protein-protein interaction. This system may be of general utility in studying the modulation of transcription factor interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1529025484,"The role of calcium in the action of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on human neutrophils is not clear. With fluorescent cytometry, using the visible wavelength calcium probe, fluo-3, and patch clamping, we investigated whether TNF induces cytosolic free Ca2+ changes and Ca(2+)-activated Cl- current, respectively. Bath application of 1000 units/ml recombinant human TNF alpha (rhTNF alpha) induced a rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ in 75% of fluo-3-loaded cells, 25% of which displayed irregular patterns of oscillation. Addition of rhTNF alpha activated Cl- current in 80% of tested cells; the activated current was blocked by 10 microM 5-nitro-2-3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid, a Cl- channel blocker. The current was similarly activated by 1 microM ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore. To study the mechanism by which rhTNF alpha induced Ca(2+)-activated Cl- current, we examined the involvement of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase). With intracellular application of the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate (5 mM), the calmodulin antagonist (2 microM), CaM kinase II-(290-309), or the inhibitory peptide (10 microM), CaM kinase II-(273-302), the current was no longer activated by rhTNF alpha. The intracellular application of the control peptide (10 microM), CaM kinase II-(284-302), or the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitory, PKC-(19-36), or control, [Glu27]PKC-(19-36), peptide (5 microM) did not block the rhTNF alpha-induced Cl- current. These results show that Ca2+ changes are associated with the effects of rhTNF alpha and that CaM kinase plays a role in the mechanism underlying rhTNF alpha-induced activation of Ca(2+)-activated Cl- current in human neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W1773651537,"The structural properties of the iron-sulfur centers of photosystem I (PSI) from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 have been investigated by EPR spectrometry. The stoichiometry of centers A, B, and X, determined by EPR intensity measurements, gives direct evidence for center X being a [4Fe-4S] center in the native system and for the core reaction center protein being a dimer. The directions of the magnetic axes of centers A, B, and X were accurately determined by EPR experiments carried out on membrane fragments oriented on thin Mylar films. These directions are very similar to those previously reported for plants and algae. To get a detailed description of the relative arrangement of A and B, the magnetic interactions between these centers have been analyzed through numerical simulations of X-band and Q-band EPR spectra. The relative orientation of the magnetic axes deduced from these simulations is fully consistent with that given by oriented multilayer experiments. Numerical simulations of X-band and Q-band EPR spectra given by spinach PSI lead to a very similar set of structural parameters, which demonstrates that the functional unit of PSI is highly conserved in all photosynthetic organisms. Moreover, the results of these studies indicate that the A-B direction is close to the membrane normal, which supports a sequential electron transfer mechanism between the iron-sulfur centers in PSI."
https://openalex.org/W1534889101,"Abstract A recombinant baculovirus overexpressing the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) origin binding protein, encoded by the UL9 gene, was constructed. The purified recombinant protein has DNA-dependent nucleoside triphosphatase activity similar to the enzyme isolated from mammalian cells. Optimal nucleoside triphosphatase activity requires low salt (< 50 mM), 2-3 mM Mg2+, alkaline pH (8.3-9.5), high temperature (45 degrees C), and a single-stranded DNA coeffector containing minimal secondary structure. Enzymatic activity is subject to product inhibition, and there appears to be a single nucleotide binding site. The minimal length of single-stranded DNA that elicits enzymatic activity is 14 nucleotides, and activity increases as the length is increased. Saturation for various single-stranded DNA coeffectors is about 10 microM in nucleotide, but the maximum velocity is reduced 2-3-fold for coeffectors containing secondary structure. The HSV-1-encoded single-stranded DNA-binding protein ICP8 specifically stimulates the DNA-dependent nucleoside triphosphatase activity. The kinetics of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis exhibit a substantial lag period which can be shortened, but not eliminated, by reduced secondary structure in the DNA coeffector or by increased temperature."

https://openalex.org/W1506790736,"We have cloned and expressed the human adenovirus type 2 proteinase gene in Escherichia coli. The expressed proteinase was isolated by a four-step chromatographic procedure. Purity and identity of the recombinant protein was established by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, N-terminal sequencing, and specific antisera. The pure enzyme did not contain disulfide bridges, and it consisted of one subunit with a pI of 10.2. It did not show any sign of autocleavage. Labeled iodoacetate bound the pure enzyme while labeled diisopropyl fluorophosphate did not. The protease readily cleaved the viral pVII protein, ovalbumin, fibrin, and actin but had no effect on synthetic penta-, octa-, or nonapeptides carrying the consensus sequence for cleavage. The inhibitory profile of the isolated proteinase and the affinity labeling clearly indicate that the human adenovirus type 2 proteinase is a cysteine rather than a serine proteinase as previously believed. The most likely candidate for an active site residue is one of the two conserved cysteines, Cys-104 or Cys-122."
https://openalex.org/W1512131061,"Mobilization of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) suppresses translational initiation and inhibits post-translational processing and secretion of glycoproteins. This study explores the mechanism whereby ionomycin, a Ca2+ ionophore, and thapsigargin, an ER Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, promote retention of alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1-AT) bearing high mannose, endoglycosidase H (Endo H)-sensitive oligosaccharide side chains within the ER of HepG2 cells. Arrest occurred at the removal of mannose residues such that intermediates with Man7-9GlcNAc2 side chains accumulated with the Man8-9GlcNAc2 structures predominating. Maturation of alpha 1-AT bearing Man5-6GlcNAc2 side chains was unaffected. Inhibition of alpha 1-AT processing by ionomycin occurred independently of translational suppression. Forms of alpha 1-AT identical to those retained with ionomycin or thapsigargin were observed upon treatment with the alpha-1,2-mannosidase inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin whereas castanospermine, an inhibitor of ER alpha-glucosidase I, produced different forms of the glycoprotein. Neither inhibitor impaired transport or secretion of alpha 1-AT. With brefeldin A, which causes redistribution of Golgi enzymes to the ER, alpha 1-AT was retained intracellularly but acquired resistance to Endo H. With ionomycin, thapsigargin, or 1-deoxymannojirimycin-treated cells, however, brefeldin A failed to promote further processing of the glycoprotein. Possible mechanisms for the suppression of alpha 1-AT processing at the alpha-1,2-mannosidase step by Ca(2+)-mobilizing agents are discussed. Excepting tunicamycin, traditional inhibitors of protein processing did not affect amino acid incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W1582733077,"Human melanoma growth stimulating activity (MGSA) is a mitogenic factor first identified in the conditioned media of human melanoma cells. Structurally, MGSA belongs to a superfamily of proteins that includes interleukin-8 (IL-8) and platelet factor 4. These proteins are involved in inflammatory processes, and an understanding of their mechanism of action should provide insight into their pathophysiology. In this study, we report the high level expression of recombinant human MGSA in Escherichia coli. The structure was confirmed by mass spectrometry and NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing. Receptor binding studies were carried out in a human melanoma cell line, Hs294T, and in U937 cells. Direct binding experiments with 125I-MGSA in Hs294T cells have allowed us to identify a novel MGSA receptor in these cells, with a KD of 3.9-4.25 nM and approximately 52,960-67,758 binding sites/cell. These MGSA-binding sites were specific and could not be displaced by unlabeled IL-8. The MGSA receptor in these cells is biologically active, and the addition of ligand induces cellular proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In U937 cells, unlabeled IL-8 and MGSA were able to completely displace radiolabeled IL-8. Scatchard analysis of the displacement binding data was consistent with binding to a single class of binding sites, and the calculated KD values were 2.4 +/- 0.6 nM for IL-8 and 3.2 +/- 0.80 nM for MGSA. Treatment of U937 cells with IL-8 or MGSA produced a rapid increase in Ca2+ flux; however, subsequent incubation with either ligand failed to produce any further Ca2+ flux. The IL-8 receptor in U937 cells was covalently labeled with 125I-IL-8 to reveal a protein with a molecular mass of 69 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1516084488,"The effects of okadaic acid (OA), a potent and specific inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatases 2A and 1, on the transient expression of a human hsp 70 promoter-linked chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene transfected into N-18 mouse neuroblastoma cells were determined. Assays of reporter gene activity showed that nanomolar concentrations of OA markedly potentiated the heat-induced (but not the basal) expression of pHBCAT, a full-length hsp 70 promoter-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene construct. This effect of OA was dose-dependent and promoter-specific and appeared to be attributable to inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A as opposed to protein phosphatase 1. The ability of OA to potentiate the heat-induced expression of pHBCAT appeared to be a feature common to several different cell types examined. We propose that the heat-induced transcriptional activation of heat shock genes is associated with the phosphorylation of component(s) of the transcription complex and that OA enhances this phosphorylation, thereby potentiating the heat-induced hsp 70 promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1590881124,"Photosystem II contains two redox-active tyrosines, D and Z. To understand the function of the dark stable tyrosine radical, D+, we have characterized two site-directed mutations at the D tyrosine residue in the transformable cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, through the use of purified photosystem II particles (Noren, G. H., Boerner, R. J., and Barry, B. A. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 3943-3950). In manganese-depleted mutant particles, a light-induced EPR signal is observed. This signal contains a stable component, due to a chlorophyll radical, and an unstable component. The lineshape of the unstable, oxidized component, which we call M+, is obtained by subtraction; it has a lineshape different from tyrosine Z+/D+ and a g value of 2.004. Up to one M+ spin per reaction center can be photooxidized. The characteristic light-induced EPR signal ascribed to Z+ is not detected; under the same conditions, Z+ is detected in control preparations. The M+ radical lineshape is similar to the light-induced photosystem II radical identified in a site-directed mutant in the D1 polypeptide (YF161D1) (Noren, G. H., and Barry, B. A. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 3335-3342). Optical measurements on manganese-depleted photosystem II particles from control and D2 mutant preparations show that charge recombination kinetics between Q-A and an oxidized redox-active component are similar, to within a factor of two, in all three preparations. We conclude that lack of the stable tyrosine D+ alters the structure or redox properties of tyrosine Z in manganese-depleted preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1484544816,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), and hypercalcemia frequently associated with ATL is mediated by parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHRP). The present study was undertaken to clarify the role of cAMP second messenger system in the regulation of human PTHRP gene expression in ATL cells, using an HTLV-I-infected T-cell line, MT-2. Forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) caused a marked and transient increase in the steady-state level of PTHRP mRNA. The effects of these agents were dose-dependent, and the maximal effects were observed at 3 h. Nuclear runoff transcription assay showed that forskolin and Bt2cAMP caused an increase in the transcription rate of the human PTHRP gene. In contrast, the stability of PTHRP mRNA was only modestly increased by these agents. Forskolin and Bt2cAMP also increased the secretion of PTHRP by MT-2 cells, as determined by both a newly established immunoradiometric assay using two antibodies against human PTHRP-(1-34) and PTHRP-(50-83) and a radioimmunoassay using an antibody against human PTHRP-(109-141). Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) caused a marked stimulation of intracellular cAMP production in MT-2 cells, whereas PGE2 and PGF2 alpha had only modest effects. The ability of these PGs to stimulate cAMP production correlated well with their ability to increase PTHRP mRNA level and the secretion of PTHRP. Indomethacin did not affect the basal level of cAMP production or PTHRP mRNA, suggesting that endogenous PG was not involved in the basal production of cAMP or PTHRP. When PGE1 was given to MT-2 cells together with interleukin 2, which is another stimulator of PTHRP gene expression, PTHRP secretion was synergistically stimulated. These results suggest that the transcription of the human PTHRP gene is enhanced through a cAMP-dependent pathway by PGE1 and that PGE1, as well as interleukin 2, plays an important role in the overexpression of the human PTHRP gene in HTLV-I-infected T cells leading to the development of hypercalcemia in ATL patients."

https://openalex.org/W1519639344,"The addition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) markedly enhanced cAMP formation induced by carbacyclin, a stable prostacyclin analogue, in cultured mast cells (IC2 cells), but did not enhance basal or NaF plus AlCl3-induced cAMP formation. On the other hand, W-7, a calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor, almost completely suppressed the enhancing activity of TPA, suggesting the involvement of CaM in the enhancement by TPA of carbacyclin-induced cAMP formation. The enhancing activity of TPA disappeared in TPA-treated cells permeabilized with saponin in the presence of Ca2+, but reconstitution with CaM in the permeable cells resulted in remarkable restoration of the action of TPA. On the other hand, TPA treatment induced the phosphorylation and translocation of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) from the membrane to the cytosol. Exogenously added protein kinase C (PKC) also phosphorylated MARCKS and induced its translocation in the cells permeabilized with saponin. Whereas the addition of CaM did not enhance the carbacyclin-stimulated GTPase activity and adenylate cyclase activity in the control permeable cells, in which MARCKS bound to the membrane, CaM markedly enhanced those activities in the PKC-treated permeable cells, which lost endogenous membrane-bound MARCKS. When MARCKS was added to the PKC-treated permeable cells, MARCKS bound to the membrane and inhibited the effects of CaM. These results suggest that activation of PKC enhances the prostacyclin-activated adenylate cyclase through a CaM/MARCKS system."
https://openalex.org/W1543568197,"Abstract Using site-directed mutagenesis, it was previously found that mutation of the individual residues Tyr13, Tyr22, Ile23, or Leu26 in the amino-terminal domain or of the highly conserved Leu47 in the carboxyl-terminal domain of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), resulted in significantly decreased receptor binding affinity. In the present study, the single-site hEGF mutants Tyr13-->His, Tyr22-->Asp, Ile23-->Thr, and Leu26-->Gly were genetically combined with the Leu47-->Ala hEGF mutant to produce a series of double-site mutant hEGF gene products having alterations simultaneously at two sites, in separate domains, within the same hEGF molecule. Similarly, the combination of the single-site hEGF mutants Tyr13-->His and Ile23-->Thr generated a double-site mutant having two mutations within the same domain. Finally, combination of the hEGF mutation Ile23-->Ala with Leu23-->Ala altered two side chains located in close proximity within the large beta-sheet region of the molecule. Analysis of the relative receptor binding affinities, determined by radioreceptor competition assays of the various single- and double-site hEGF mutants, demonstrated that mutation at any one site does not substantially alter the effect of mutation at the second site in the molecule. The cumulative effect of simultaneous mutations on relative receptor binding affinity confirms the importance of residues, including those in the large amino-terminal beta-sheet, in receptor binding, and indicates that each of the separate sites functions essentially independently in the interaction of the hEGF molecule with its receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2007513646,"We have discovered a 27 kd protein of E. coli that binds to a terminator site (tau)-terminator protein (ter) complex and abrogates the replication fork-arresting activity of ter protein in vitro. The 27 kd protein also neutralizes the contrahelicase activity of ter protein, allowing dnaB helicase to unwind DNA past a tau-ter complex. The stimulatory activity of low levels of ter protein on helicase II is also abolished by the 27 kd protein. The binding of the 27 kd protein to a tau-ter complex does not appear to dissociate the ter protein from the DNA. Although the in vivo function of the 27 kd protein is unknown at this time, it has the major attributes of a novel replication antiterminator in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1596645901,"The joining peptide (JP) portion of pro-opiomelanocortin extracted from mouse pituitary glands has previously been shown to exist in one major and several distinct minor forms (Bennett, H. P. J. (1986) Peptides 7, 614-622). We now confirm the heterogeneous nature of JP extracted from mouse neurointermediate pituitary glands and show that similar forms of JP are also to be found in extracts of porcine pituitary glands. Three forms of porcine JP (pJP-A, pJP-B, and pJP-C) were purified from whole porcine pituitary glands using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography methods. The three structural variants constitute approximately 10, 75, and 15%, respectively, of the total JP observed. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that pJP-C was 18 mass units smaller than pJP-B, which is consistent with the formation of a succinimide structure at the aspartyl 16-glycine 17 peptide bond. Such symmetrical imide structures are known to hydrolyze at physiological pH to yield a mixture of the original alpha-aspartyl peptides and isomerized isoaspartyl peptides. We were able to show that pJP-A was the isomerized isoaspartyl form by demonstrating that pJP-A but not pJP-B was a substrate for the protein carboxyl methyltransferase enzyme (L-isoaspartyl/D-aspartyl protein methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.77) purified from bovine erythrocytes. This cytosolic enzyme is known to preferentially methylate L-isoaspartyl residues within model substrates. Control experiments in which JP was incubated in the acidic medium used to extract the pituitary tissue showed that the isoforms of pJP are not artifacts of peptide purification. Furthermore, we have isolated the isoforms of pJP at levels which are 100 times greater than would be expected for a spontaneous reaction. We conclude that the formation of the aspartimide form of JP appears to be a facilitated process, possibly occurring as a result of conformation constraints dictated by the structure of pro-opiomelanocortin, or an as yet uncharacterized post-translational event."

https://openalex.org/W1633815641,"Fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (FITC) markedly inhibited ryanodine binding to rabbit skeletal muscle junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum. Half-maximal inhibition was obtained with about 20 microM and complete inhibition by 80 microM FITC. Inhibition was enhanced in the presence of high salt and at alkaline pH. The pH dependence of the inactivation of ryanodine binding suggested that FITC bound to a very reactive lysine epsilon-amino group with a pK alpha of about 7.5 or above. Kinetic analysis of the time course of inactivation of ryanodine binding by various concentrations of FITC suggested that the inactivation resulted from the modification of 2 or more amino acid residues. The inhibition of ryanodine binding by FITC was partially prevented by ATP, ADP, adenyl imidodiphosphate, and 3-O-(benzoyl)-benzoyl-ATP (Bz-ATP) but not by AMP. FITC modification of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes inhibited the photoaffinity labeling by [alpha-32P]Bz-ATP of the 450-kDa protein and the ryanodine receptor with half-maximal inhibition at about 100 microM. The results suggest that the inhibition of ryanodine binding is mainly due to FITC modification of sites which are not involved in ATP binding. The FITC moiety is bound to the 160-, 96-, 76-, and 60-kDa ryanodine receptor tryptic fragments, and the FITC site is apparently on the 21.5-, 18-, and 17-kDa fragments which are formed by the V8 protease. Covalent modification by FITC dramatically affected the activity of single Ca2+ release channels incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. FITC caused a marked increased in channel open probability mainly to a noisy approximately 60% subconductance state. FITC-modified channels were no longer affected by ryanodine but were still abolished by Mg2+ and ruthenium red. We suggest that FITC modifies reactive lysine residues involved in channel activation by transmembrane charge movement in the t-tubular system."
https://openalex.org/W1522287904,"The herpes simplex virus trans-activator Vmw65 interacts with the cellular factors Oct-1 and VCAF-1 to generate a multicomponent DNA binding complex that specifically recognizes conserved enhancer elements found upstream of the viral immediate-early genes, resulting in potent stimulation of their transcription. We have identified a HeLa cell factor, distinct from Oct-1 or VCAF-1, which significantly enhances the stability or formation of Vmw65-dependent complexes, as judged by mobility shift analysis using either nuclear extracts or bacterially expressed Oct-1 and Vmw65. This factor, designated SF (stimulatory factor), was partially purified from HeLa cell postnuclear extracts and has an apparent molecular weight of 1500-3000, based on ultrafiltration and size-exclusion chromatography. SF was shown to be resistant to inactivation by heat treatment, protease, nuclease, and phospholipase digestions, and extraction with organic solvents. Pretreatment of SF with beta-glucuronidase did not affect its ability to stimulate Vmw65-dependent complex formation but did reduce the electrophoretic mobility of the resulting complex. These data indicate that SF is probably a component of the Vmw65-induced complex and may be composed, at least partially, of carbohydrate."

https://openalex.org/W1509140850,"The stoichiometry of NADPH-dependent O2 consumption expressed by reconstituted latent oxidase obtained by combining cytosol and membrane fractions from resting human neutrophils with GTP gamma S and SDS in a cell-free assay was evaluated with regard to NADPH consumed and superoxide and H2O2 production. Oxidase activity monitored simultaneously by O2 uptake analysis using a Clark cell and O2 electrode for O2 consumption, and spectrally at 340 nm for NADPH oxidation, in the presence of excess superoxide dismutase and catalase, yielded an O2 uptake: NADPH consumption ratio of 0.51 +/- 0.04 (+/- 1 S.D., n = 6). In the presence of varying concentrations of ferricytochrome c in excess of 100 microM, and with exclusion of superoxide dismutase, the net rate of O2 consumption plateaued at approximately 6% of the rate seen with exclusion of ferricytochrome c from final assay mixtures. Cytosol and solubilized membrane fractions employed in these assays were devoid of endogenous superoxide trapping, or dismutase-like, activities. These results indicate that of the total O2 consumed, 94% is associated with direct univalent generation of superoxide. The remaining albeit low level of O2 consumption appears to be recovered in the form of H2O2 indicating that the cell-free oxidase reconstituted with SDS is capable of channeling electron equivalents through its redox sites in a highly controlled manner in ensuring that superoxide is its principal O2 reduction product concomitant with oxidation of NADPH."
https://openalex.org/W1616240306,"The mechanism underlying the unusual specificity of bacteriophage T4 deoxynucleotide kinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of 5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidylate, dTMP, and dGMP, has been investigated by chemical modification of the protein. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate inactivates deoxynucleotide kinase by modifying a single lysine out of the 17 per monomer. Lysine 10 has been tentatively identified as the site of modification, although the possibility of mutually exclusive reactive residues has not been eliminated. Diethylpyrocarbonate also inactivates the enzyme, suggesting that histidine plays a role in catalytic function. With either reagent, the three activities are lost at equal rates, supporting the contention that one active site is responsible for the exclusive phosphorylation of three dissimilar deoxynucleotides. These studies also identify two distant regions of the primary sequence that are likely to be closely associated in the active region of the folded protein."

https://openalex.org/W1487343851,"Signal transduction by glucocorticoid hormones is mediated by the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor protein. The mechanisms determining cell type- or tissue-specific differences in hormone responsiveness remain, however, unclear. To address this issue we have used two different rat hepatoma cell lines, 762 and 6.10.2, respectively, in which mouse mammary tumor virus has been stably integrated. Nuclear extracts from both of these cell lines contained a factor that bound to a sequence motif extending from -163 to -147 in the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter and that appeared to repress hormonal induction of viral mRNA expression. Transient transfection experiments indicated that the cellular levels of this putative repressor did not affect basal promoter activity; this factor appeared rather to determine cellular sensitivity to glucocorticoids. Moreover, in these experiments the relative levels of the glucocorticoid receptor appeared to be the main determinant of maximum inducibility of virus expression by hormone. Taken together, these data indicate that the differential expression patterns of receptor versus the putative repressor protein may determine the level of hormonal responsiveness of target genes in glucocorticoid-sensitive tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1594744111,"Murine T helper cloned cells permeabilized with the bacterial lysin, tetanolysin, were used to investigate the role of intracellular Ca2+ in regulating myo-[2-3H] inositol phospholipid (InsPL) hydrolysis triggered upon perturbation of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex. [Ca2+] was controlled by a calcium/magnesium/EGTA buffer. Antibody (mAb) aggregation of CD3 induced InsPL hydrolysis in the absence of added Ca2+. However, stimulated InsPL hydrolysis increased with the free [Ca2+], reaching a maximum at 100-300 nM [Ca2+]. Ca2+ increased the overall efficiency of hydrolysis without changes in EC50 of the anti-CD3 mAb. The response diminished at > 300 nM [Ca2+] due to a mixed type inhibition. Ca2+ alone had no effect on inositol phosphate levels. Polyphosphoinositides were preferentially cleaved, since no accumulation of Ins(1)P/Ins(3)P was detected, indicating that direct hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol did not occur, irrespective of the Ca2+ concentration. [Ca2+] above 300 nM shifted the relative amounts of CD3-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) in favor of the latter. Unlabeled permeabilized cells exposed to > or = 100 nM [Ca2+] showed enhanced conversion of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 to [3H]Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. In conclusion, InsPL hydrolysis is optimally triggered by CD3 perturbation at intracellular Ca2+ levels approximating those observed in intact resting lymphocytes (100 nM). Ca2+ concentrations similar to those triggered by InsPL-derived metabolites may inhibit InsPL hydrolysis and promote Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 production, thus controlling the amounts of Ins(1,4,5)P3."
