https://openalex.org/W2913551250,"In Denmark, the cesarean section rate has increased by 49% between 1998 and 2015 and accounts for 21% of all births. Cesarean sections may cause short- as well as long-term consequences for both the mother and the child and impose further risks in future pregnancies. Delaying pregnancy until advanced maternal age at childbirth has been suggested as contributing to the increase. The proportion of women giving birth at 35 years or above increased from 15% (1998) to 21% (2015). Advanced maternal age at childbirth has been found to be related to increased pre-pregnancy morbidity and associated risk factors that may contribute to an increased risk of cesarean section. The aim of this study was to examine the association between advanced maternal age and cesarean section in a Danish population and the influence of demographic, anthropometric, health, and obstetric factors on this association.This study draws on a national population-based cohort study of all Danish births between 1998 and 2015 (N = 1,122,964). Maternal age less than 30 years serves as reference with the following age categories: (30-34 years); (35-39 years), and (40 years and above). The primary outcome was a cesarean section. Multivariate regression models with adjustment for demographic, health, pregnancy, fetal, and obstetric characteristics were performed with the results further stratified by parity.In general, a positive association between advanced maternal age and cesarean section was found. Only minor changes in the risk estimate occurred after adjustment for relevant confounders. In comparison with the reference category, nulliparous women aged 35-39- years had twice the risk for cesarean section (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) [2.11-2.26]) whereas for women of 40 years or above, the risk was more than tripled (AOR 3.64, 95% CI [3.41-3.90]). For multiparous women aged 35-39-years the risk was more moderate, but still with an AOR of 1.56, 95% CI [1.53-1.60], and for those 40 years and above, the AOR was 2.02, 95% CI [1.92-2.09].Overall, cesarean section increased with increasing maternal age. Adjustment for maternal and obstetric risk factors had only a minor influence on the association. The association was stronger in nulliparous women compared to multiparous women. Given the lack of impact of demographic and health risks on the relationship between maternal age and cesarean section, the authors suggest obstetric culture could be added to the list of risk factors for a cesarean. Future research on obstetric culture is recommended as are studies on a possible age-related decrease in the ability to maintain the progression of labor.The study uses depersonalized register data and has been approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (2015-41-4168)."
https://openalex.org/W2911912069,"Treatment of glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumors, is a major medical challenge and the development of new alternatives requires simple yet realistic models for these tumors. In vitro spheroid models offer attractive platforms to mimic the tumor behavior in vivo and have thus, been increasingly applied for assessment of drug efficacy in various tumors. The aim of this study was to produce and characterize size-controlled U251 glioma spheroids towards application in glioma drug evaluation studies. To this end, we fabricated agarose hydrogel microwells with cylindrical shape and diameters of 70–700 μm and applied these wells without any surface modification for glioma spheroid formation. The resultant spheroids were homogeneous in size and shape, exhibited high cell viability (> 90%), and had a similar growth rate to that of natural brain tumors. The final size of spheroids depended on cell seeding density and microwell size. The spheroids’ volume increased linearly with the cell seeding density and the rate of this change increased with the well size. Lastly, we tested the therapeutic effect of an anti-cancer drug, Di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) on the resultant glioma spheroids and demonstrated the applicability of this spheroid model for drug efficacy studies."
https://openalex.org/W2912686122,"Nurses who experience workplace violence exhibit compromised care quality and decreased work morale, which may increase their turnover rate. This study explored prevalence of workplace violence, the reaction of victims, and workplace strategies adopted to prevent violence among acute psychiatric settings in northern Taiwan. A cross-sectional study was conducted, which consisted of 429 nurses who completed the Chinese version of the Workplace Violence Survey Questionnaire developed by the International Labor Office, International Council of Nurses, World Health Organization, and Public Services International. The rates of physical and psychological violence were 55.7% and 82.1%, respectively. Most perpetrator of the workplace violence were patients. Most victims responded by instructing the perpetrator to stop, followed by narrating the incident to friends, family, and colleagues. Only 4.9%–12% of the victims completed an incident or accident form, and the main reason for not reporting these violent incidents was the belief that reporting such incidents was useless or unimportant. The major strategies adopted by workplaces to prevent violence were security measures, patient protocols, and training. Institutions should train staff to handle violence, provide a therapeutic environment, simplify the reporting process, and encourage reporting of all types of violence."
https://openalex.org/W2914321351,"Recent molecular data has strongly suggested that field-collected cysts of snow algae that are morphologically identifiable as the zygotes of Chloromonas nivalis are composed of multiple species. Motile vegetative cells, however, have not been directly obtained from these cysts because of the difficulties involved in inducing their germination. Recently, our comparative molecular analyses, using both field-collected and cultured materials, demonstrated that one Japanese lineage of “C. nivalis zygotes” belongs to C. miwae. Herein, we examined another Japanese lineage of field-collected “C. nivalis zygotes” and a new strain originating from Japan. Our molecular data demonstrated that these two different life cycle stages are conspecific, and that they represent a new species that we herein describe as C. muramotoi sp. nov., based on the vegetative and asexual morphological characteristics of the strain. Multigene phylogenetic analyses showed that this new species was sister to C. miwae. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the cysts of C. muramotoi are different from those of C. miwae, based on the arrangement of the flanges developing on the cell wall."

The aim of this study was to compare the different phenotypes inside the ACO definition in a real-life population cohort.We analyzed patients from the MAJORICA cohort who had a diagnosis of asthma and/or COPD based on current guidelines, laboratory data in 2014 and follow-up until 2015. Prevalence of ACO according to the different criteria, demographic, clinical and functional characteristics, prescriptions and use of health resources data were compared between three groups.We included 603 patients. Prevalence of smoking asthmatics was 14%, COPD patients with high bronchodilator response 1.5% and eosinophilic COPD patients 12%. Smoking asthmatics were younger and used more rescue inhalers, corticosteroids and health resources. Conversely, eosinophilic COPD patients were older than the other groups, often treated with corticosteroids and had lower use of health resources. Most of the COPD patients with high bronchodilator response were included in the eosinophilic COPD group.ACO includes two conditions (smoking asthmatics and eosinophilic COPD patients) with different medication requirement and prognosis that should not be pooled together. Use of ≥300 blood eosinophils/μL as a treatable trait should be recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2913992496,"Background In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated the global methodology for assessing and reducing missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV), when eligible children have contact with the health system but are not vaccinated. This paper presents the results of two pilot assessments conducted in Chad and Malawi. Methods Using the ten-step global WHO MOV strategy, we purposively selected districts and health facilities, with non-probabilistic sampling of <24 month old children for exit interviews of caregivers and self-administered knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) surveys of health workers. MOV were calculated based on a child’s documented vaccination history (i.e., from a home-based record (HBR) or a health facility vaccination register), including selected vaccines in the national schedule. Results Respondents included caregivers of 353 children in Chad and of 580 children in Malawi. Among those with documented vaccination history, 82% (195/238) were eligible for vaccination in Chad and 47% (225/483) in Malawi. Among eligible children, 51% (99/195) in Chad, and 66% (149/225) in Malawi had one or more MOV on the survey date. During non-vaccination visits, 77% (24/31) of children eligible for vaccination in Chad and 92% (119/129) in Malawi had a MOV compared to 46% (75/164) and 31% (30/96) during vaccination visits, respectively. Among health workers, 92% in Chad and 88% in Malawi were unable to correctly identify valid contraindications for vaccination. Conclusion The new MOV tool was able to characterize the type and potential causes of MOV. In both countries, the findings of the assessments point to two major barriers to full vaccination of eligible children—a lack of coordination between vaccination and curative health services and incomplete vaccination during vaccination visits. National immunization programs should explore tailored efforts to improve health worker practices and to increase vaccine delivery by making better use of existing health service contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2913736513,"Purpose To evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of myopia in adult Korean population. Methods Population-based cross-sectional data of 3,398 subjects aged 19 to 49 years was obtained using the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013–2014 (KNHANES VI). Data, including refractive errors and potential risk factors were analyzed. The prevalence and risk factors of myopia, low myopia, and high myopia—defined as a spherical equivalent (SEQ) ≤ -0.5 diopters (D), -6.0 D < SEQ <-0.5 D, and SEQ ≤ -6.0 D, respectively—were evaluated. Results The prevalence of myopia and high myopia were 70.6 (standard error (SE), ±1.1)% and 8.0 (SE, ±0.6)%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, younger age, higher education (≥12 years), parental myopia, lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration (<9 ng/mL), longer time spent on near work (≥3 hours/day), and higher white blood cell (WBC) count (5–8.9 x 103) were associated with increased prevalence of both myopia and high myopia. Serum 25(OH)D concentration of ≥ 9 ng/ml was significantly associated with decreased prevalence of high myopia in participants with near work of ≥3 hours/day, although the effect was not significant in myopia and low myopia. Conclusions The prevalence of myopia and high myopia in Korean adults was substantially high, which increased with decreasing age. In addition to parental myopia, the serum 25(OH)D concentration, near work and inflammation reflected by WBC counts may be associated with myopia."
https://openalex.org/W2914576668,"Adenovirus executes a finely tuned transcriptional program upon infection of a cell. To better understand the temporal dynamics of the viral transcriptional program we performed highly sensitive digital PCR on samples extracted from arrested human lung fibroblasts infected with human adenovirus 5 strain dl309. We show that the first transcript made from viral genomes is the virus associated non-coding RNA, in particular we detected abundant levels of virus associated RNA II four hours after infection. Activation of E1 and E4 occurred nearly simultaneously later in infection, followed by other early genes as well as late genes. Our study determined that genomes begin to replicate between 29 and 30 hours after infection. This study provides a comprehensive view of viral mRNA steady-state kinetics in arrested human cells using digital PCR."

There are a number of studies carried out to find its effective antiviral, however to date, there is still no molecule either from peptide or small molecules released as a drug. The present study aims to identify small molecules inhibitor from National Cancer Institute database through virtual screening. One of the hits, D0713 (IC50 = 62 μM) bearing thioguanine scaffold was derivatised into 21 compounds and evaluated for DENV-2 NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitory activity. Compounds 18 and 21 demonstrated the most potent activity with IC50 of 0.38 μM and 16 μM, respectively. Molecular dynamics and MM/PBSA free energy of binding calculation were conducted to study the interaction mechanism of these compounds with the protease. The free energy of binding of 18 calculated by MM/PBSA is -16.10 kcal/mol compared to the known inhibitor, panduratin A (-11.27 kcal/mol), which corroborates well with the experimental observation. Results from molecular dynamics simulations also showed that both 18 and 21 bind in the active site and stabilised by the formation of hydrogen bonds with Asn174."
https://openalex.org/W2915044328,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin found in abundance in brain regions such as the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum and basal forebrain. It has been associated with the risk of susceptibility to major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to determine the association of three BDNF variants (rs6265, rs1048218 and rs1048220) with Malaysian MDD patients.The correlation of these variants to the plasma BDNF level among Malaysian MDD patients was assessed. A total of 300 cases and 300 matched controls recruited from four public hospitals within the Klang Valley of Selangor State, Malaysia and matched for age, sex and ethnicity were screened for BDNF rs6265, rs1048218 and rs1048220 using high resolution melting (HRM).BDNF rs1048218 and BDNF rs1048220 were monomorphic and were excluded from further analysis. The distribution of the alleles and genotypes for BDNF rs6265 was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the controls (p = 0.13) but was in Hardy Weinberg disequilibrium for the cases (p = 0.011). Findings from this study indicated that having BDNF rs6265 in the Malaysian population increase the odds of developing MDD by 2.05 folds (95% CI = 1.48-3.65). Plasma from 206 cases and 206 controls were randomly selected to measure the BDNF level using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A significant decrease in the plasma BDNF level of the cases as compared to controls (p<0.0001) was observed. However, there was no evidence of the effect of the rs6265 genotypes on the BDNF level indicating a possible role of other factors in modulating the BDNF level that warrants further investigation.The study indicated that having the BDNF rs6265 allele (A) increase the risk of developing MDD in the Malaysian population suggesting a possible role of BDNF in the etiology of the disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2911843571,"We show that in an animal model of anxiety the overall excitation, particularly in the infralimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (IL), is increased and that the activity ratio between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons (AR PN/IN) is shifted towards excitation. The same change in AR PN/IN is evident for wildtype mice, which have been exposed to an anxiety stimulus. We hypothesize, that an elevated activity and the imbalance of excitation (PN) and inhibition (IN) within the neuronal microcircuitry of the prefrontal cortex is responsible for anxiety behaviour and employed optogenetic methods in freely moving mice to verify our findings. Consistent with our hypothesis elevation of pyramidal neuron activity in the infralimbic region of the prefrontal cortex significantly enhanced anxiety levels in several behavioural tasks by shifting the AR PN/IN to excitation, without affecting motor behaviour, thus revealing a novel mechanism by which anxiety is facilitated."
https://openalex.org/W2912742022,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an aggressive cancer with high resistance to chemotherapeutics. CCA is enriched in cancer stem cells, which correlate with aggressiveness and prognosis. FXR, a member of the metabolic nuclear receptor family, is markedly down-regulated in human CCA. Our aim was to evaluate, in primary cultures of human intrahepatic CCA (iCCA), the effects of the FXR agonist obeticholic acid (OCA), a semisynthetic bile acid derivative, on their cancerogenic potential. Primary human iCCA cell cultures were prepared from surgical specimens of mucinous or mixed iCCA subtypes. Increasing concentrations (0–2.5 μM) of OCA were added to culture media and, after 3–10 days, effects on proliferation (MTS assay, cell population doubling time), apoptosis (annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide), cell migration and invasion (wound healing response and Matrigel invasion assay), and cancerogenic potential (spheroid formation, clonogenic assay, colony formation capacity) were evaluated. Results: FXR gene expression was downregulated (RT-qPCR) in iCCA cells vs normal human biliary tree stem cells (p < 0.05) and in mucinous iCCA vs mixed iCCA cells (p < 0.05) but was upregulated by addition of OCA. OCA significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited proliferation of both mucinous and mixed iCCA cells, starting at a concentration as low as 0.05 μM. Also, CDCA (but not UDCA) inhibited cell proliferation, although to a much lower extent than OCA, consistent with its different affinity for FXR. OCA significantly induced apoptosis of both iCCA subtypes and decreased their in vitro cancerogenic potential, as evaluated by impairment of colony and spheroid formation capacity and delayed wound healing and Matrigel invasion. In general, these effects were more evident in mixed than mucinous iCCA cells. When tested together with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin, OCA potentiated the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of these chemotherapeutics, but mainly in mixed iCCA cells. OCA abolished the capacity of both mucinous and mixed iCCA cells to form colonies when administered together with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin. In subcutaneous xenografts of mixed iCCA cells, OCA alone or combined with Gemcitabine or Cisplatin markedly reduced the tumor size after 5 weeks of treatment by inducing necrosis of tumor mass and inhibiting cell proliferation. In conclusion, FXR is down-regulated in iCCA cells, and its activation by OCA results in anti-cancerogenic effects against mucinous and mixed iCCA cells, both in vitro and in vivo. The effects of OCA predominated in mixed iCCA cells, consistent with the lower aggressiveness and the higher FXR expression in this CCA subtype. These results, showing the FXR-mediated capacity of OCA to inhibit cholangiocarcinogenesis, represent the basis for testing OCA in clinical trials of CCA patients."

Survey questions included demographic, clinical information, dermatology- and vitiligo-specific QoL questionnaires. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to identify risk factors that related to poor QoL.In total, 884 respondents were included in the analyses, of which 413 (46.7%) were male. The score of DLQI was 5.83±5.75 (mean± SD). Age, gender, marriage status, occupational status, anogenital involvement, patient-perceived severity (presented by VAS score), symptoms as itching, pain, sunburn and koebner phenomenon, total cost of treatment and degree of satisfaction in camouflage therapy were independently associated with DLQI score (p<0.05).Vitiligo has considerable impact on QoL of affected patients in Chinese population even when they were using camouflage. Camouflage might be helpful to improve QoL of the patients."
https://openalex.org/W2912198398,"Glial cells missing homolog 2 (GCM2), a zinc finger-type transcription factor, is essential for the development of parathyroid glands. It is considered to be a master regulator because the glands do not form when Gcm2 is deficient. Remarkably, Gcm2 expression is maintained throughout the fetal stage and after birth. Considering the Gcm2 function in embryonic stages, it is predicted that Gcm2 maintains parathyroid cell differentiation and survival in adults. However, there is a lack of research regarding the function of Gcm2 in adulthood. Therefore, we analyzed Gcm2 function in adult tamoxifen-inducible Gcm2 conditional knockout mice. One month after tamoxifen injection, Gcm2-knockout mice showed no significant difference in serum calcium, phosphate, and PTH levels and in the expressions of calcium-sensing receptor (Casr) and parathyroid hormone (Pth), whereas Ki-67 positive cells were decreased and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) positive cell number did not change, as compared with those of controls. Seven months after tamoxifen injection, Gcm2-knockout mice showed shrinkage of the parathyroid glands and fewer parathyroid cells. A significant decrease was noted in Casr- and Pth-expressing cells and serum PTH and Ca levels, whereas serum phosphate levels increased, as compared with those of controls. All our results concluded that a reduction of Gcm2 expression leads to a reduction of parathyroid cell proliferation, an increase in cell death, and an attenuation of parathyroid function. Therefore, we indicate that Gcm2 plays a prominent role in adult parathyroid cell proliferation and maintenance."

Next to its role in magnesium homeostasis, EGF disturbances have been described in oncology, diabetes and autism spectrum disorders. The aim of this study was to determine EGF serum and urine values for both healthy children and adults. Next, we investigated the relation between several variables and urinary and serum EGF concentrations. Methods Both healthy adults (n = 50) and children (n = 78) were included. Serum and urinary EGF concentrations were measured with ELISA technology. Results Serum EGF was inversely correlated with age (r = —0.873; p<0.001) and positively correlated with serum magnesium (r = 0.597; p<0.001). The urinary EGF was also inversely correlated with age (r = -0.855; p<0.001). In adults and children older than 13 years of age, the urinary EGF significantly differed between sexes (p = 0.001). Urinary EGF was positively correlated with serum magnesium (r = 0.583; p<0.001) and creatinine clearance (r = 0.524; p<0.001) and negatively correlated with the fractional excretion of magnesium (r = 0.248; p = 0.014). In a multivariate model, age and serum magnesium remained independently related to serum EGF while age, serum EGF and serum magnesium remained independently related to urinary EGF. Conclusions This study provides valuable insights in urinary and serum EGF patterns in healthy subjects. By systematically correcting EGF for body surface, significant correlations with age, gender and magnesium were observed."
https://openalex.org/W2912099898,"The prevalence of back pain in athletes has been investigated in several studies, but there are still under- or uninvestigated sports discipline like sports exposed to repetitive overhead activity. Elite athletes spend much time in training and competition and, because of the nature of their disciplines, subject their bodies to a great deal of mechanical strain, which puts a high level of stress on their musculoskeletal systems. From this it is hypothesized that elite athletes who engage in repetitive overhead motions experience a higher strain on their spine and thus possibly a higher prevalence of back pain compared with an active control group.To examine the prevalence of back pain and the exact location of pain in a cohort of elite athletes with repetitive overhead activity and in a control group of physically active sport students. Additionally, to examine different characteristics of pain, and to evaluate the influence of confounders on back pain.A standardized and validated online back pain questionnaire was sent by the German Olympic Sports Confederation to German national and international elite athletes, and a control group of physically active but non-elite sports students.The final sample comprised 181 elite athletes of the sports disciplines badminton, beach volleyball, handball, tennis and volleyball and 166 physically active controls. In elite athletes, lifetime prevalence of back pain was 85%, 12-month prevalence was 75%, 3-month prevalence was 58% and point prevalence was 38%; for the physically active control group, these prevalences were 81%, 70%, 59% and 43%, respectively. There was no significant group difference in prevalence over all time periods. The lower back was the main location of back pain in elite athletes across all disciplines and in controls; additionally a distinct problem of upper back pain was found among volleyball players.Despite the high mechanical load inherent in the sport disciplines included in this study, the elite athletes who engaged in repetitive overhead activities did not suffer more from back pain than the physically active controls. This suggests that other mechanisms may be influencing back pain prevalences in a positive way in these athletes. Furthermore, these disciplines may practice preventive factors for back pain that outweigh their detrimental factors. Therefore, we posit that extensive prevention work is already being implemented in these sports and that there are additional individual protection factors in play. More research is required to explore these suppositions, and should include investigations into which preventive training programs are being used. Nevertheless, in volleyball particularly, a focus on stabilization/preventive training should be applied to the upper back and neck."
https://openalex.org/W2913586349,"Vaginal washing is a common practice associated with adverse outcomes including bacterial vaginosis (BV) and HIV infection. Prior studies have not examined the associations between vaginal washing and individual vaginal bacteria, or whether these associations are independent of the effect of vaginal washing on BV. The purpose of this study was to characterize the association between vaginal washing and the presence and concentrations of vaginal bacteria associated with optimal and sub-optimal vaginal states. The analysis utilized data from participants in the placebo arm of the Preventing Vaginal Infections trial, which enrolled HIV-uninfected women from the United States and Kenya. Detection of bacterial taxa associated with BV was compared between visits with versus without reported vaginal washing. The effect of vaginal washing on a number of vaginal bacteria differed substantially (p<0.05) between the US and Kenya, so results were stratified by country. In US women, vaginal washing was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of detection of BV associated bacterium 1 (BVAB1) (relative risk [RR] 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–2.09, p = 0.004), BVAB2 (RR 1.99, 95%CI 1.46–2.71, p<0.001), Mageeibacillus indolicus (RR 2.08, 95%CI 1.46–2.96, p<0.001), Atopobium vaginae (RR 1.34, 95%CI 1.13–1.59, p = 0.001), Leptotrichia/Sneathia species (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.33–2.09, p<0.001), Megasphaera species (RR 1.78, 95%CI 1.34–2.37, p<0.001) and Gardnerella vaginalis (RR 1.08, 95%CI 1.01–1.16, p = 0.02). No significant association between vaginal washing and bacterial detection was found in Kenyan women. Adjustment for bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by Gram stain did not alter these results. This study provides evidence that the association between vaginal washing and detection of individual bacterial taxa can vary regionally. For some vaginal bacteria, the association with vaginal washing may be independent of the effect on Gram stain detection of BV. Larger prospective studies in diverse geographic settings should explore whether eliminating vaginal washing impacts the presence and concentrations of key vaginal bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2912349211,"The endophytic Streptomyces sp. VV/E1, and rhizosphere Streptomyces sp. VV/R4 strains, isolated from grapevine plants were shown in a previous work to reduce the infection rate of fungal pathogens involved in young grapevine decline. In this study we cloned fragments from randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and developed two stably diagnostic sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers of 182 and 160 bp for the VV/E1 and VV/R4 strains, respectively. The SCAR markers were not found in another 50 actinobacterial strains isolated from grapevine plants. Quantitative real-time PCR protocols based on the amplification of these SCAR markers were used for the detection and quantification of both strains in plant material. These strains were applied on young potted plants using two methods: perforation of the rootstock followed by injection of the microorganisms or soaking the root system in a bacterial suspension. Both methods were combined with a booster treatment by direct addition of a bacterial suspension to the soil near the root system. Analysis of uprooted plants showed that those inoculated by injection exhibited the highest rate of colonization. In contrast, direct addition of either strain to the soil did not lead to reliable colonization. This study has developed molecular tools for analyzing different methods for inoculating grapevine plants with selected Streptomyces sp. strains which protect them from fungal infections that enter through their root system. These tools are of great applied interest since they could easily be established in nurseries to produce grafted grapevine plants that are protected against fungal pathogens. Finally, this methodology might also be applied to other vascular plants for their colonization with beneficial biological control agents."
https://openalex.org/W2914845720,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CiPN) is a serious adverse effect in the clinic, but nonclinical assessment methods in animal studies are limited to labor intensive behavioral tests or semi-quantitative microscopic evaluation. Hence, microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers and automated in-life behavioral tracking were assessed for their utility as non-invasive methods. To address the lack of diagnostic biomarkers, we explored miR-124, miR-183 and miR-338 in a CiPN model induced by paclitaxel, a well-known neurotoxic agent. In addition, conventional and Vium's innovative Digital Vivarium technology-based in-life behavioral tests and postmortem microscopic examination of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and the sciatic nerve were performed. Terminal blood was collected on days 8 or 16, after 20 mg/kg paclitaxel was administered every other day for total of 4 or 7 doses, respectively, for plasma miRNA quantification by RT-qPCR. DRG and sciatic nerve samples were collected from mice sacrificed on day 16 for miRNA quantification. Among the three miRNAs analyzed, only miR-124 was statistically significantly increased (5 fold and 10 fold on day 8 and day 16, respectively). The increase in circulating miR-124 correlated with cold allodynia and axonal degeneration in both DRG and sciatic nerve. Automated home cage motion analysis revealed for the first time that nighttime motion was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in paclitaxel-dosed animals. Although both increase in circulating miR-124 and decrease in nighttime motion are compelling, our results provide positive evidence warranting further testing using additional peripheral nerve toxicants and diverse experimental CiPN models."
https://openalex.org/W2913853821,"Acute ischemia reperfusion injury in skeletal muscle remains an important issue in several fields of regenerative medicine. Thus, a valid model is essential to gain deeper insights into pathophysiological relations and evaluate possible treatment options. While the vascular anatomy of mice regularly prevents sufficient vessel occlusion by invasive methods, there is a multitude of existing models to induce ischemia reperfusion injury without surgical procedures. Since there is no consensus on which model to prefer, this study aims to develop and evaluate a novel, optimized low-pressure tourniquet model. C57BL/6 mice underwent an ischemic procedure by either tourniquet or invasive artery clamping. A sham group served as control. With exception of the sham group, mice underwent 2 hours of ischemia followed by 4 hours of reperfusion. Groups were compared using microcirculatory and spectroscopic measurements, distinctions in tissue edema, histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Both procedures led to a significant decrease in tissue blood flow (- 97% vs. - 86%) and oxygenation (- 87% vs. - 75%) with a superiority of the low-pressure tourniquet. Tissue edema in the tourniquet cohort was significantly increased (+ 59%), while the increase in the clamping cohort was non-significant (+ 7%). Haematoxylin Eosin staining showed significantly more impaired muscle fibers in the tourniquet group (+ 77 p.p. vs. + 11 p.p.) and increased neutrophil infiltration/ROI (+ 51 vs. + 8). Immunofluorescence demonstrated an equal increase of p38 in both groups (7-fold vs. 8-fold), while the increase in apoptotic markers (Caspase-3, 3-Nitrotyrosine, 4-Hydroxynonenal) was significantly higher in the tourniquet group. The low-pressure tourniquet has been proven to produce reproducible and thus reliable ischemia reperfusion injury. In addition, significantly less force was needed than previously stated. It is therefore an important instrument for studying the pathophysiology of ischemia reperfusion injury and for the development of prophylactic as well as therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2913417926,"Objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the iterative reconstruction of high-pitch dual-source chest CT (IR-HP-CT) scanned with low radiation exposure compared with low dose chest CT (LDCT).This study was approved by the institutional review board. Thirty healthy adult volunteers (mean age 44 years) were enrolled in this study. All volunteers underwent both IR-HP-CT and LDCT. IR-HP-CT was scanned with 120 kVp tube voltage, 30 mAs tube current and pitch 3.2 and reconstructed with sinogram affirmed iterative reconstruction. LDCT was scanned with 120 kVp tube voltage, 40 mAs tube current and pitch 0.8 and reconstructed with B50 filtered back projection. Image noise, and signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the infraspinatus muscle, subcutaneous fat and lung parenchyma were calculated. Cardiac motion artifact, overall image quality and artifacts was rated by two blinded readers using 4-point scale. The dose-length product (DLP) (mGy∙cm) were obtained from each CT dosimetry table. Scan length was calculated from the DLP results. The DLP parameter was a metric of radiation output, not of patient dose. Size-specific dose estimation (SSDE, mGy) was calculated using the sum of the anteroposterior and lateral dimensions and effective radiation dose (ED, mSv) were calculated using CT dosimetry index.Approximately, mean 40% of SSDE (2.1 ± 0.2 mGy vs. 3.5 ± 0.3 mGy) and 34% of ED (1.0 ± 0.1 mSv vs. 1.5 ± 0.1 mSv) was reduced in IR-HP-CT compared to LDCT (P < 0.0001). Image noise was reduced in the IR-HP-CT (16.8 ± 2.8 vs. 19.8 ± 3.4, P = 0.0001). SNR of lung and aorta of IR-HP-CT showed better results compared with that of LDCT (22.2 ± 5.9 vs. 33.0 ± 7.8, 1.9 ± 0.4 vs 1.1 ± 0.3, P < 0.0001). The score of cardiac pulsation artifacts were significantly reduced on IR-HP-CT (3.8 ± 0.4, 95% confidence interval, 3.7‒4.0) compared with LDCT (1.6 ± 0.6, 95% confidence interval, 1.3‒1.8) (P < 0.0001). SNR of muscle and fat, beam hardening artifact and overall subjective image quality of the mediastinum, lung and chest wall were comparable on both scans (P ≥ 0.05).IR-HP-CT with 120 kVp and 30 mAs tube setting in addition to an iterative reconstruction reduced cardiac motion artifact and radiation exposure while representing similar image quality compared with LDCT."
https://openalex.org/W2914136259,"Full-length mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequence information from lobster phyllosoma larvae can be difficult to obtain when DNA is degraded or fragmented. Primers that amplify smaller fragments are also more useful in metabarcoding studies. In this study, we developed and tested a method to design a taxon-specific mini-barcode primer set for marine lobsters. The shortest, most informative portion of the COI gene region was identified in silico, and a DNA barcode gap analysis was performed to assess its reliability as species diagnostic marker. Primers were designed, and cross-species amplification success was tested on DNA extracted from a taxonomic range of spiny-, clawed-, slipper- and blind lobsters. The mini-barcode primers successfully amplified both adult and phyllosoma COI fragments, and were able to successfully delimit all species analyzed. Previously published universal primer sets were also tested and sometimes failed to amplify COI from phyllosoma samples. The newly designed taxon-specific mini-barcode primers will increase the success rate of species identification in bulk environmental samples and add to the growing DNA metabarcoding toolkit."
https://openalex.org/W2951135469,"Malaria remains a significant health problem in Mozambique, particularly in the case of pregnant women and children less than five years old. Intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPT-SP) is recommended for preventing malaria in pregnancy (MiP). Despite the widespread use and cost-effectiveness of IPTp-SP, coverage remains low. In this study, we explored factors limiting access to and use of IPTp-SP in a rural part of Mozambique.We performed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to collect data from 46 pregnant women and four health workers in Chókwè, a rural area of southern Mozambique. Data were transcribed, translated where appropriate, manually coded, and the content analyzed according to key themes. The women interviewed were not aware of the risks of MiP or the benefits of its prevention. Delays in accessing antenatal care, irregular attendance of visits, and insufficient time for proper antenatal care counselling by health workers were driving factors for inadequate IPTp delivery.Pregnant women face substantial barriers in terms of optimal IPTp-SP uptake. Health system barriers and poor awareness of the risks and consequences of MiP and of the measures available for its prevention were identified as the main factors influencing access to and use of IPTp-SP. Implementation of MiP prevention strategies must be improved through intensive community health education and increased access to other sources of information. Better communication between health workers and ANC clients and better knowledge of national ANC and IPTp policies are important."
https://openalex.org/W2913958211,"There is a high incidence of type 2 diabetes in Asian adults, even those with a normal body mass index (BMI) (<25.0 kg/m2). For example, it has been shown that a slightly increased BMI (>23 kg/m2) at middle age is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes in Asians. In this historical cohort study, we investigated whether a slightly increased BMI at college age was also a risk factor for future diabetes in Japanese men.Six hundred and sixty-one male alumni who graduated from a physical education school between 1971 and 1991 and who responded to follow-up investigation between 2007 and 2017 were included in this study. Participants were categorized into four categories: college BMI of <21.0 kg/m2, 21.0-22.0 kg/m2, 22.0-23.0 kg/m2, and ≥23.0 kg/m2, and the incidence and risk ratio of diabetes were compared between groups.The median follow-up period was 32 years (interquartile range, IQR: 27-36), which included 20,983 person-years of observation. Subjects were 22 (22-22) years old at college graduation, and 55 (50-59) years old at the final follow-up investigation. During the study period, 56 men developed diabetes; the prevalence rates for the lowest to highest BMI categories were 4.4%, 7.6%, 10.5%, and 11.3%, respectively, and their adjusted hazard ratios were 1.00 (reference), 1.77 (95% CI: 0.68-4.30), 2.42 (1.00-5.84), and 2.53 (1.06-6.07), respectively (p = 0.03 for trend).Our data suggest that a BMI over 22.0 kg/m2 at college age is a risk factor for diabetes later in life in Japanese men."
https://openalex.org/W2914099159,"Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system. Given the chronic and heterogenous nature of the disease, treatment with various therapies is a frequent scenario in clinical practice. In persons with chronic morbidity such as MS patients, polypharmacy can give rise to considerable health problems. Objectives The aim of the present study was to examine the frequency of polypharmacy among relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients as well as to analyse sociodemographic and clinical factors, which might be associated with polypharmacy (use of five or more medications). Differences in medication between MS patients with and without secondary illnesses (PwSI and Pw/oSI), between men and women and between patients with and without polypharmacy (PwP and Pw/oP) were examined. Methods For 145 RRMS outpatients, we prospectively collected data by means of anamnesis, patient records, clinical examination and a structured patient interview. This was followed by comparative analyses of various patient subgroups (PwP vs. Pw/oP, PwSI vs. Pw/oSI, men vs. women). Results The proportion of included MS patients with polypharmacy (use of ≥5 medications) was 30.3%. PwP were significantly older than Pw/oP (45.9 vs. 41.7 years), had a lower level of education and showed a significantly higher median EDSS score (3.0 vs. 2.0). Comorbidities (p<0.001; odds ratio [OR] = 6.293) and higher EDSS scores (p = 0.029; OR = 1.440) were associated with a higher risk of polypharmacy. The proportion of polypharmacy among PwSI was approximately four times higher than among Pw/oSI (46.8% vs. 11.8%). Particularly in the use of antihypertensives, gastrointestinal drugs and dietary supplements, there were differences between Pw/oP and PwP. Conclusion We found a high burden of polypharmacy in patients with RRMS. This particularly applies to more severely disabled MS patients who suffer from comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2911803585,"Background Intensive care unit (ICU) readmission is generally associated with increased hospital stays and increased mortality. However, there are limited data on ICU readmission in critically ill cancer patients. Method We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the prospective registry of all critically ill cancer patients admitted to the oncology medical ICU between January 2012 and December 2013. After excluding patients who were discharged to another hospital or decided to end-of-life care, we divided the enrolled patients into four groups according to the time period from ICU discharge to unexpected events (ICU readmission or ward death) as follows: no (without ICU readmission or death, n = 456), early (within 2 days, n = 42), intermediate (between 2 and 7 days, n = 64), and late event groups (after 7 days of index ICU discharge, n = 129). The independent risk factors associated with ICU readmission or unexpected death after ICU discharge were also analyzed using multinomial logistic regression model. Results There were no differences in the reasons for ICU readmission across the groups. ICU mortality did not differ among the groups, but hospital mortality was significantly higher in the late event group than in the early event group. Mechanical ventilation during ICU stay, tachycardia, decreased mental status, and thrombocytopenia on the day of index ICU discharge increased the risk of early ICU readmission or unexpected ward death, while admission through the emergency room and sepsis and respiratory failure as the reasons for index ICU admission were associated with increased risk of late readmission or unexpected ward death. Interestingly, recent chemotherapy within 4 weeks before index ICU admission was inversely associated with the risk of late readmission or unexpected ward death. Conclusion In critically ill cancer patients, patient characteristics predicting ICU readmission or unexpected ward death were different according to the time period between index ICU discharge and the events."
https://openalex.org/W2912193359,"Background Currently, patients receiving vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) grafts must take long-term systemic immunosuppressive therapy to prevent immunologic rejection. The morbidity and mortality associated with these medications is the single greatest barrier to more patients being able to receive these life-enhancing transplants. In contrast to solid organs, VCA, exemplified by hand or face transplants, allow visual diagnosis of clinical acute rejection (AR), directed biopsy and targeted graft therapies. Local immunosuppression in VCA could reduce systemic drug exposure and limit adverse effects. This proof of concept study evaluated, in a large animal forelimb VCA model, the efficacy and tolerability of a novel graft-implanted enzyme-responsive, tacrolimus (TAC)—eluting hydrogel platform, in achieving long-term graft survival. Methods Orthotopic forelimb VCA were performed in single haplotype mismatched mini-swine. Controls (n = 2) received no treatment. Two groups received TAC hydrogel: high dose (n = 4, 91 mg TAC) and low dose (n = 4, 49 mg TAC). The goal was to find a dose that was tolerable and resulted in long-term graft survival. Limbs were evaluated for clinical and histopathological signs of AR. TAC levels were measured in serial blood and skin tissue samples. Tolerability of the dose was evaluated by monitoring animal feeding behavior and weight. Results Control limbs underwent Banff Grade IV AR by post-operative day six. Low dose TAC hydrogel treatment resulted in long-term graft survival time to onset of Grade IV AR ranging from 56 days to 93 days. High dose TAC hydrogel also resulted in long-term graft survival (24 to 42 days), but was not well tolerated. Conclusion Graft-implanted TAC-loaded hydrogel delays the onset of Grade IV AR of mismatched porcine forelimb VCA grafts, resulting in long term graft survival and demonstrates dose-dependent tolerability."
https://openalex.org/W2914230244,"Oxidative stress has been considered as one of pathogenesis of brain damage led by epilepsy. Reducing oxidative stress can ameliorate brain damage during seizures. However, expression levels of important antioxidative enzymes such as thioredoxin-1 (TRX1), thioredoxin-like 1 protein (TXNL1) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) during seizures have not been investigated. In this study, we examined protein and mRNA expression levels of TRX1, TXNL1 and TXNRD1 in different brain regions in PTZ induced seizure model mice. We found that protein expression levels of TRX1, TXNL1 and TXNRD1 are simultaneously up-regulated by 2- or 3-fold in the cortex of both acute and chronic seizure model mice. But there is no unified expression pattern change of these enzymes in the hippocampus, cerebellum and diencephalon in the seizure model mice. Less extent up-regulation of mRNA expression of these enzymes were also observed in the cortex of seizure mice. These data suggest that antioxidative enzymes may provide a protective effect against oxidative stress in the cortex during seizures."
https://openalex.org/W2911252986,"VanS is a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase responsible for sensing vancomycin and activating transcription of vancomycin-resistance genes. In the presence of vancomycin, VanS phosphorylates the transcription factor VanR, converting it to its transcriptionally active form. In the absence of vancomycin, VanS dephosphorylates VanR, thereby maintaining it in a transcriptionally inactive state. To date, the mechanistic details of how vancomycin modulates VanS activity have remained elusive. We have therefore studied these details in an in vitro system, using the full-length VanS and VanR proteins responsible for type-A vancomycin resistance in enterococci. Both detergent- and amphipol-solubilized VanSA display all the enzymatic activities expected for a sensor histidine kinase, with amphipol reconstitution providing a marked boost in overall activity relative to detergent solubilization. A putative constitutively activated VanSA mutant (T168K) was constructed and purified, and was found to exhibit the expected reduction in phosphatase activity, providing confidence that detergent-solubilized VanSA behaves in a physiologically relevant manner. In both detergent and amphipol solutions, VanSA's enzymatic activities were found to be insensitive to vancomycin, even at levels many times higher than the antibiotic's minimum inhibitory concentration. This result argues against direct activation of VanSA via formation of a binary antibiotic-kinase complex, suggesting instead that either additional factors are required to form a functional signaling complex, or that activation does not require direct interaction with the antibiotic."
https://openalex.org/W2912655884,"Background A well-known supportive treatment for acute nonspecific back pain, elastic back support belts, are valued for their ability to accelerate natural self-healing, but there are concerns of a deconditioning effect due to their reliance on passive stabilization. Methods To evaluate the systematic effects of elastic abdominal belts on the trunk musculature, a total of 36 persons with acute lumbar back pain (no longer than one week) were divided into two groups: an abdominal belt wearing group (B) and a non-abdominal belt wearing control group (C). All were examined over a period of three weeks at three time points: T1 just after assignment, T2 one week later, and T3 further two weeks later. Surface EMG (sEMG) was used to record trunk muscle activation when walking on a treadmill at walking speeds of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 km/h. Similarly, pain intensity (VAS) and functional impairment (ODI) over time were recorded in both groups. Results Over the observation period, a slight advantage for decreased pain intensity (C: p<0.05 T2 vs. T1; B: p<0.01 T2 vs. T1, p<0.05 T3 vs. T1) and decreased functional impairment (Cohen's d vs. T1, C: T2 0.45, T3 0.86; B: T2 1.1, T3 1.0) was observed for the belt group. For the belt group both oblique abdominal muscles exhibited significantly lower sEMG throughout the observation period (external abdominal oblique muscle: (T1), T2, (T3), internal abdominal oblique muscle: T1, (T2), (T3)) and the sEMG for the back muscles ranged from unchanged to slightly elevated for this group, but never reached statistical significance. Discussion The reduced abdominal amplitude levels in the belt group likely result from the permanent elastic stabilization provided by the belt: the required elevated intra-abdominal pressure to enhance spinal stability is then provided by lessened abdominal muscle activity complemented by the belt’s elastic support. With regard to the back muscles, the belt, due to its movement-restricting effect, tends to activate the paravertebral musculature. In this respect, the effect of elastic abdominal belts on the trunk muscles is not uniform. Therefore, the present results suggest that the effect of elastic abdominal belts appears to be more of a temporary neutral alteration of trunk muscle coordination, with some trunk muscles becoming more active and others less, and not a case of uniform deconditioning as is suspected."
https://openalex.org/W2914050920,"Standard radiological/topographical classifications of gliomas often do not reflect the real extension of the tumor within the lobar-cortical anatomy. Furthermore, these systems do not provide information on the relationship between tumor growth and the subcortical white matter architecture. We propose the use of an anatomically standardized grid system (the Brain-Grid) to merge serial morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with a representative tractographic atlas. Two illustrative cases are presented to show the potential advantages of this classification system.MRI scans of 39 patients (WHO grade II and III gliomas) were analyzed with a standardized grid created by intersecting longitudinal lines on the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. The anatomical landmarks were chosen from an average brain, spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and the Talairach space. Major white matter pathways were reconstructed with a deterministic tracking algorithm on a reference atlas and analyzed using the Brain-Grid system.In all, 48 brain grid voxels (areas defined by 3 coordinates, axial (A), coronal (C), sagittal (S) and numbers from 1 to 4) were delineated in each MRI sequence and on the tractographic atlas. The number of grid voxels infiltrated was consistent, also in the MNI space. The sub-cortical insula/basal ganglia (A3-C2-S2) and the fronto-insular region (A3-C2-S1) were most frequently involved. The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, uncinate fasciculus, and external capsule were the most frequently associated pathways in both hemispheres.The Brain-Grid based classification system provides an accurate observational tool in all patients with suspected gliomas, based on the comparison of grid voxels on a morphological MRI and segmented white matter atlas. Important biological information on tumor kinetics including extension, speed, and preferential direction of progression can be observed and even predicted with this system. This novel classification can easily be applied to both prospective and retrospective cohorts of patients and increase our comprehension of glioma behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2914151611,"Wetlands enrolled in the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) are established as a means of restoring wetland ecosystems and wildlife habitat on private, agricultural land. In West Virginia, USA, ACEP wetlands have never been evaluated to determine how they function as wildlife habitat in comparison to other available wetland habitat in the state. We measured the wintering occupancy of Passerellidae species and apparent avian species richness on ACEP wetlands and a set of reference wetlands located on public land in West Virginia to evaluate if ACEP wetlands are being used similarly by avian species to other available wetland habitat in the state. Apparent avian species richness and the occupancy probability of four Passerellidae species-song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana), and white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis)-did not differ between ACEP and reference sites. In addition to other vegetative and habitat associations for each species, dark-eyed junco occupancy was negatively correlated with wetland size while swamp sparrow occupancy and apparent avian species richness were positively associated with wetland size. These results indicate that ACEP wetlands are providing winter avian habitat as well as another source of wetland habitat in the state. Maintaining and expanding ACEP wetlands in West Virginia would continue to provide wetland systems in areas that are otherwise lacking these habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2912319277,"In studying blood flow in the vessels, the characteristics of non-Newtonian fluid are important, considering the role of viscosity in rheology. Stenosis, which is an abnormal narrowing of the vessel, has an influence on flow behavior. Therefore, analysis of blood flow in stenosed vessels is essential. However, most of them exist as simulation outcomes. In this study, non-Newtonian fluid was observed in stenosed microchannels under the pulsatile flow condition. A polydimethylsiloxane channel with 60% stenosis was fabricated by combining an optic fiber and a petri dish, resembling a mold. Three types of samples were prepared by changing the concentrations of xanthan gum, which induces a shear thinning effect (phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution as the Newtonian fluid and two non-Newtonian fluids mimicking normal blood and highly viscous blood analog). The viscosity of the samples was measured using a Y-shaped microfluidic viscometer. Thereafter, velocity profiles were analyzed under the pulsatile flow condition using the micro-particle image velocimetry (PIV) method. For the Newtonian fluid, the streamline was skewed more to the wall of the channel. The velocity profile of the non-Newtonian fluid was generally blunter than that of the Newtonian fluid. A highly oscillating wall shear stress (WSS) during the pulsatile phase may be attributed to such a bluntness of flow under the same wall shear rate condition with the Newtonian fluid. In addition, a highly viscous flow contributes to the variation in the WSS after passing through the stenosed structures. A similar tendency was observed in simulation results. Such a variation in the WSS was associated with plaque instability or rupture and damage of the tissue layer. These results, related to the influence on the damage to the endothelium or stenotic lesion, may help clinicians understand relevant mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2912428117,"Reproductive performance is a key indicator of the long-term sustainability of any livestock production system. Testicular hypoplasia (TH) is a morphological and functional reproductive disorder that affects bulls around the world and consequently causes major economic losses due to reduced fertility rates. Despite the improvements in management practices to enhance performance of affected animals, the use of hypoplastic animals for reproduction might contribute to expand the prevalence of this disorder. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions that are associated with TH in Nellore cattle by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and functional analyses. Phenotypic and pedigree data from 47,563 animals and genotypes (500,689 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, SNPs) from 265 sires were used in this study. TH was evaluated as a binary trait measured at 18 months of age. The estimated breeding values (EBVs) were calculated by fitting a single-trait threshold animal model using a Bayesian approach. The SNP effects were estimated using the Bayes C method and de-regressed EBVs for TH as the response variable (pseudo-phenotype). The top-15 ranking windows (5-adjacent SNPs) that explained the highest proportion of variance were identified for further functional and biological network analyses. The posterior mean (95% highest posterior density) of the heritability for TH was 0.16 (0.08; 0.23). The most important genomic windows were located on BTA1, BTA3, BTA4, BTA5, BTA9, BTA22, BTA23, and BTA25. These windows explained together 22.69% of the total additive genetic variance for TH. Strong candidate genes associated with metabolism and synthesis of steroids, cell survival, spermatogenesis process and sperm motility were identified, which might play an important role in the expression of TH. Our findings contribute to a better biological understanding of TH and future characterization of causal variants might enable improved genomic prediction of this trait in beef cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2912809630,"The adsorption of volatile organic compounds by building materials reduces the pollutant concentrations in indoor air. We collected three interior building materials with adsorption potentials—latex paint, micro-carbonized plywood, and moisture-buffering siding—used the sorptive building materials test (SBMT) to determine how much they reduced indoor formaldehyde (HCHO) concentrations, and then assessed the consequent reduction in human cancer risk from HCHO inhalation. Adsorption of HCHO by building materials significantly improved the effective ventilation efficiency. For example, the equivalent ventilation rate for Celite siding—used for humidity control—was 1.44 m3/(m2·h) at 25°C, 50% relative humidity (RH); the loading factor (L) was 0.4 m2/m3, and the HCHO concentration was 0.2 ppm; this effect is equivalent to a higher ventilation rate of approximately 0.6 air changes per hour in a typical Taiwanese dwelling. There was also a substantial reduction of risk in Case MCP-2 (Cin,te: 245 μg/m3, 30°C, 50% RH): males: down 5.73 × 10−4; females: down 4.84 × 10−4). The selection of adsorptive building materials for interior surfaces, therefore, significantly reduces human inhalation of HCHO. Our findings should encourage developing and using innovative building materials that help improve indoor air quality and thus provide building occupants with healthier working and living environments."
https://openalex.org/W2914125710,"As they approach a traffic light, drivers and pedestrians monitor the color (instructed stimulus feature) and/or the position of the signal (covarying stimulus feature) for response selection. Many studies have pointed out that instructions can effectively determine the stimulus features used for response selection in a task. This leaves open whether and how practice with a correlating alternative stimulus feature can lead to a strategy change from an instructed to a learned variant of performing the task. To address this question, we instructed participants to respond to the position of a stimulus within a reference frame, at the same time, during task performance, an unmentioned second stimulus feature, the color, covaried with stimulus position and allowed the use of an alternative response strategy. To assess the impact of the non-instructed stimulus feature of color on response selection throughout practice, the spatial position of the stimulus was ambiguous on some trials. Group average increases in color usage were based on a mixture of (1) participants who, despite extended practice on the covariation, exclusively relied on the instructed stimulus feature and (2) those who abruptly started to rely heavily on stimulus color to select responses in ambiguous trials. When the instructed and uninstructed feature predicted different actions, choices were still biased by the uninstructed color feature, albeit more weakly. A second experiment showed that the influence of color generalized across frequently and infrequently presented combinations of position and color. Strategy changes were accompanied by awareness in both experiments. The results suggest that incidental covariation learning can trigger spontaneous voluntary strategy change involving a re-configuration of the instructed task set."
https://openalex.org/W2914210636,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are essential regulators of epigenetic gene silencing and development. The PcG protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2) is a key component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and is responsible for placing the histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) repressive mark on the genome through its methyltransferase domain. Ezh2 is highly conserved in vertebrates. We studied the role of ezh2 during development of zebrafish with the use of a mutant allele (ezh2(sa1199), R18STOP), which has a stop mutation in the second exon of the ezh2 gene. Two versions of the same line were used during this study. The first and original version of zygotic ezh2(sa1199) mutants unexpectedly retained ezh2 expression in brain, gut, branchial arches, and eyes at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf), as revealed by in-situ hybridization. Moreover, the expression pattern in homozygous mutants was identical to that of wild types, indicating that mutant ezh2 mRNA is not subject to nonsense mediated decay (NMD) as predicted. Both wild type and ezh2 mutant embryos presented edemas at 2 and 3 dpf. The line was renewed by selective breeding to counter select the non-specific phenotypes and survival was assessed. In contrast to earlier studies on ezh2 mutant zebrafish, ezh2(sa1199) mutants survived until adulthood. Interestingly, the ezh2 mRNA and Ezh2 protein were present during adulthood (70 dpf) in both wild type and ezh2(sa1199) mutant zebrafish. We conclude that the ezh2(sa1199) allele does not exhibit an ezh2 loss-of-function phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2914893277,"Isoniazid-resistant, rifampin susceptible tuberculosis (INHR-TB) is the most common form of drug resistant TB globally. Treatment of INHR-TB with standard first-line therapy is associated with high rates of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB). We modelled the potential impact of INHR-TB detection and appropriate treatment on MDR-TB prevalence.A decision analysis model was developed to compare three different strategies for the detection of TB (AFB smear, Xpert MTB/RIF, and Line-Probe Assays (LPA)), combined with appropriate treatment. The population evaluated were patients with a globally representative prevalence of newly diagnosed, drug-susceptible (88.6%), isoniazid-resistant (7.3%), and multidrug resistant (4.1%) pulmonary TB. Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients with MDR-TB after initial attempt at diagnosis and treatment within a 2-year period. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of i) individuals with detected TB who acquired MDR-TB ii) individuals who died after initial attempt at diagnosis and treatment.After initial attempt at diagnosis and treatment, LPA combined with appropriate INHR-TB therapy resulted in a lower proportion of prevalent MDR-TB (1.61%; 95% Uncertainty Range (UR: 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles generated from 10 000 Monte Carlo simulation trials) 1.61-1.65), when compared to Xpert (1.84%; 95% UR 1.82-1.85) and AFB smear (3.21%; 95% UR 3.19-3.26). LPA also resulted in fewer cases of acquired MDR-TB in those with detected TB (0.35%; 95% UR 0.34-0.35), when compared to Xpert (0.67%; 95% UR 0.65-0.67) and AFB smear (0.68%; 95% UR 0.67-0.69). The majority of acquired MDR-TB arose from the treatment of INHR-TB in all strategies. Xpert-based strategies resulted in a lower proportion of death (2.89%; 95% UR 2.87-2.90) compared to LPA (2.93%; 95% UR 2.91-2.94) and AFB smear (3.21%; 95% UR 3.19-3.23).Accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment of INHR-TB with LPA led to an almost 50% relative decrease in acquired MDR-TB when compared with an Xpert MTB/RIF strategy. Continued reliance on diagnostic and treatment protocols that ignore INHR-TB will likely result in further generation of MDR-TB."

We analyzed the extent of methylation in each tissue using quantitative TaqMan methylation-specific PCR for CDO1. Significantly higher CDO1 methylation was observed in cancer tissues compared with non-cancerous mucosa of the small intestine (ROC = 0.96). Among the various clinicopathological factors, positive correlation of CDO1 methylation with tumor diameter was observed (R = 0.31, p = 0.03), and the CDO1 methylation level was a possible prognostic factor for relapse-free survival (p = 0.09). Compared with CRC, SBC had a significantly poorer prognosis (p = 0.007) and displayed a significantly higher CDO1 methylation level (p < 0.0001). Intriguingly, especially in pStage I/II, there were robust prognostic difference between SBC and CRC (p = 0.08 / p < 0.0001), which may reflect CDO1 methylation status (p = 0.02 / p = 0.001). Among small bowel tumors, CDO1 methylation in SBC was higher in order of malignant lymphoma, cancer, and leiomyosarcoma/GIST (p = 0.002) by ANOVA. The CDO1 gene shows extremely cancer-specific hypermethylation, and it can be a prognostic marker in SBC."

However, little is known about ocular activity during mindfulness meditation, a mental practice naturally involving mind-wandering episodes. In order to explore this issue, we extracted closed-eyes ocular movement measurements via a covert technique (EEG recordings) from expert meditators during two repetitions of a 7-minute mindfulness meditation session, focusing on the breath, and two repetitions of a 7-minute instructed mind-wandering task. Power spectral density was estimated on both the vertical and horizontal components of eye movements. The results show a significantly smaller average amplitude of eye movements in the delta band (1–4 Hz) during mindfulness meditation than instructed mind-wandering. Moreover, participants’ meditation expertise correlated significantly with this average amplitude during both tasks, with more experienced meditators generally moving their eyes less than less experienced meditators. These findings suggest the potential use of this measure to detect mind-wandering episodes during mindfulness meditation and to assess meditation performance."
https://openalex.org/W2914398609,"According to life-history theory, paternal investment affects the well-being of offspring. We hypothesized that environmental stress caused by a lack of paternal investment may diminish maternal resource allocation during pregnancy, especially for women who already have dependent children. Our study was conducted on a representative group of more than 80,500 singleton, live-born, full-term infants born in Krakow, Poland in the period 1995–2009. Birth data were obtained from the birth registry. We found that missing data about fathers (a proxy measure of low paternal investment) was associated with higher probability of multiparous mothers giving birth to low-birth-weight infants (1.48; 95% CI 1.05–2.08), but this was not the case with primiparous mothers (1.19; 95% CI 0.89–1.59). The statistically significant synergistic effect between parity and paternal investment was found (Synergy Factor = 2.12; 95% CI 1.47–3.05, p<0.001). These findings suggest that in situations of low paternal investment, multiparous mothers face trade-offs between investing in existing versus unborn children, therefore investment in the latter is lower. Such a strategy may benefit maternal fitness due to investment in older children, who have higher reproductive value."
https://openalex.org/W2911650099,"Under the new kidney allocation system (KAS), implemented in 2014, the distribution of the best quality donor kidney grafts shifted between age groups, but it is unclear whether this change translates to meaningful differences in post-transplant outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 20,345 deceased donor kidney transplant recipients before and 4,605 recipients after implementation of the KAS using data from the United Network of Organ Sharing. Overall, two-year mortality was greater among recipients in the post-KAS era compared with the pre-KAS era (6.31% vs 5.91% respectively, [p = 0.01]), and two-year graft loss was not significantly different between eras (9.95% and 9.65%, respectively [p = 0.13]). In analysis stratified by age group (18–45, 46–55, 56–65, and ≥66 years), relative risk of mortality was 1.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09–1.98) among recipients 46–55 years old and 1.47 (95% CI 1.18–1.81) among recipients 56–65 years old. Relative risk of all-cause graft loss was 1.43 (95% CI 1.20–1.70) among recipients 56–65 years old. There were no significant differences in relative risk of mortality or graft loss associated with the KAS era among other age groups. After adjustment for recipient characteristics and characteristics of the changing donor pool, relative risk of two-year mortality and graft loss associated with the post-KAS era was attenuated for recipients aged 46–55 and 56–65 years, but remained statistically significant. In this early analysis after implementation of the KAS, there is suggestion that increased risk of mortality and graft loss may be disproportionately borne by middle-aged recipients, which is only partially accounted for by changes in recipient and donor characteristics. These findings signal a need to continue to monitor the effects of the KAS to ensure that allocation practices both maximize utility of the kidney graft pool and respect fairness between age groups."
https://openalex.org/W2911631869,"Equine influenza (EI) is an infectious respiratory disease of horses that has never been reported in New Zealand (NZ). However, the 2007 EI outbreak in Australia, previously EI free, spurred the NZ government and stakeholders into evaluating alternative EI control strategies in order to economically justify any future decision to eradicate or manage EI. To build on the policy debate, this paper presents an epinomic (epidemiologic and economic) modelling approach to evaluate alternative control strategies. An epidemiologic model to determine how alternative EI control strategies influence the distribution of EI. Model results were then input into a cost-benefit analysis framework, to identify the return and feasibility of alternative EI eradication strategies in NZ.The article explores nine alternative eradication scenarios and two baseline strategies. The alternative scenarios consisted of three vaccination strategies (suppressive, protective or targeted) starting at three time points to reflect the commercial breeding-cycle. These alternatives were compared to two breeding-cycle adjusted baselines: movement restriction in the breeding season (August to January) or non-breeding season (February to July). The economic loss parameters were incursion response, impact to the commercial racing industry (breeding, sales and racing), horse morbidity and mortality, and compensation to industry participants.Results suggest that the economic viability of the EI eradication programme is dependent on when within the breeding-cycle the EI outbreak occurs. If an outbreak were to occur, the return on each dollar invested for protective or suppressive vaccination strategies would be between NZD$3.67 to NZD$4.89 and between NZD$3.08 to NZD$3.50 in the breeding and non-breeding seasons, respectively. Therefore, protective or suppressive vaccination strategies could be prioritised, regardless of season. As multiple industry stakeholders benefit from these strategies, the study will enable policy development and to better formulate a user-pays eradication programme."
https://openalex.org/W2912589537,"Incidental emotions are defined as feelings that are unrelated to a decision task at hand and thereby not normatively relevant for making choices. The precise influence and formal theoretical implications of incidental emotions regarding financial risk taking are still largely unclear. An effect of incidental emotion on decision-making would challenge the main extant formal theoretical economic models because such models do not allow for an effect of incidental emotions. As financial risk taking is pervasive in modern economies, the role of incidental emotions is an important issue. The goal of this experimental study is threefold. First, we examine the impact of incidental fear on the choice between a sure and a risky monetary option. A well-validated method of fear induction, using electric shocks, is employed for that purpose. Based on emotion studies we hypothesize less risk taking under fear and more risk taking when relieved of fear. Our second goal is to investigate the relative performance of the main existing formal theoretical economic models (based on Expected Utility Theory, Prospect Theory, or the Mean-Variance model) in explaining the behavioral data. We also investigate how these models can be adjusted to accommodate any observed influence of incidental emotion. For that reason, we first theoretically model the potential pathways of incidental fear (and the relief thereof) via the valuation of the choice option rewards or risk-assessment. We then estimate the relevant parameters allowing for both additive as well as interactive effects. Our third and final goal is to explore the neural basis of any observed influence of incidental emotions on decision-making by means of a model-based fMRI analysis, using the findings of existing neuroeconomic studies as the basis for our hypotheses. Our results indicate that the relief of fear can give a substantial boost to financial risk taking (suggestive of exuberance). This impact is best captured by Prospect Theory if we allow for an increase in participants’ valuation of option outcomes when relieved of fear. Moreover, this impact is manifested at the neural level by the activity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a brain area widely regarded as being central for valuation."
https://openalex.org/W2913917630,"Self-persuasion (i.e., generating your own arguments) is often more persuasive than direct persuasion (i.e., being provided with arguments), even when the technique is applied in media messages by framing the message as a question. It is unclear, however, if these messages are more persuasive when viewed for a long period to allow more elaboration about the message, or for a short period to reduce elaboration. In the current experiment, this is addressed by examining whether anti-alcohol posters framed as a statement (direct persuasion) or an open-ended question (self-persuasion) are more effective to reduce alcohol consumption under conditions of short- or long message exposure, compared to a control condition (no poster). Additionally, the potentially moderating roles of self-perceived alcohol identity and self-esteem on both types of persuasion are examined. Participants (N = 149) were exposed to a self-persuasion or direct persuasion anti-alcohol poster, either briefly before or continuously during a bogus beer taste task. The amount of alcohol consumed was the covert dependent variable. Contrary to expectations, both posters failed to affect alcohol consumption, regardless of exposure length. No moderation effects for self-perceived alcohol identity and self-esteem of the participants were found. Possible explanations are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2915016830,"Background Fertility desires of female and male partners in current relationships are often correlated. We examined the influence of HIV seropositive status of female and male partners on short-term fertility desires in Rakai, Uganda, a setting with high fertility and HIV infection rates. Methods Participants were couples (15–49 years old) enrolled in the Rakai Community Cohort Study, from 2011 to 2013 (n = 2,291). Cohen’s kappa coefficient was used to measure the correlation of female and male partners’ short-term fertility desires (measured as ‘wanting a child in the next 12 months’), in both total sample and stratified serostatus groups. HIV serostatus and additional characteristics of female and male partners were included in Poisson regression models to estimate the rate ratios (RR) for each partner’s short-term fertility desires. Individual and partner characteristics included HIV status, partner HIV status, age in years, partner age in years, educational attainment, number of living children, community of residence, and socioeconomic status (SES). Results Short-term fertility desires among female and male partners were moderately associated (Kappa = 0.37, p-value<0.001). The association was weakest among female sero-positive and male sero-negative couples (Kappa = 0.29, p-value<0.001). When adjusting for parity and other covariates in the model, women’s short-term fertility desires were significantly associated with their positive sero-status regardless of male partners’ sero-status (adjRR = 1.58, p<0.001 for F+M-; adjRR = 1.33, p = 0.001 for F+M+; in comparison with F-M-). Men’s short-term fertility desires were significantly associated with their positive sero-status, in addition to their female partners’ positive sero-status (adjRR = 1.23 with p-value = 0.022 for F-M+; adjRR = 1.42 with p-value<0.001 for F+M-; adjRR = 1.26 with p-value<0.001 for F+M+; in comparison with F-M-). When the differential effect of parity was included in the model, similar associations remained for both female and male partners when the number of living children was small, but largely reduced when the number of living children was large (3 or more). Conclusion Female and male partners in couple dyads demonstrated moderate agreements about short-term fertility desires. The HIV seropositive status of female partners was most strongly associated with short-term fertility desires of both genders, and this association was even stronger for women who had few or no living children."
https://openalex.org/W2912141088,"The tumor suppressor p16Ink4a, encoded by the INK4a gene, is an inhibitor of cyclin D-dependent kinases 4 and 6, CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibition prevents the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), resulting in cellular senescence through inhibition of E2F-mediated transcription of S phase genes required for cell proliferation. The p16Ink4a plays an important role in tumor suppression, whereby its deletion, mutation, or epigenetic silencing is a frequently observed genetic alteration in prostate cancer. To assess its roles and related molecular mechanisms in prostate cancer initiation and progression, we generated a mouse model with conditional deletion of p16Ink4a in prostatic luminal epithelium. The mice underwent oncogenic transformation and developed prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) from eight months of age, but failed to develop prostatic tumors. Given the prevalence of aberrant androgen signaling pathways in prostate cancer initiation and progression, we then generated R26hARL/wt:p16L/L: PB-Cre4 compound mice, in which conditional expression of the human AR transgene and deletion of p16Ink4a co-occur in prostatic luminal epithelial cells. While R26hARL/wt:PB-Cre4 mice showed no visible pathological changes, R26hARL/wt:p16L/L: PB-Cre4 compound mice displayed an early onset of high-grade PIN (HGPIN), prostatic carcinoma, and metastatic lesions. Strikingly, we observed tumors resembling human sarcomatoid carcinoma with intermixed focal regions of signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) in the prostates of the compound mice. Further characterization of these tumors showed they were of luminal epithelial cell origin, and featured characteristics of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) with enhanced proliferative and invasive capabilities. Our results not only implicate a biological role for AR expression and p16Ink4a deletion in the pathogenesis of prostatic SRCC, but also provide a new and unique genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model for investigating the molecular mechanisms for SRCC development."
https://openalex.org/W2914208402,"We propose the fabrication of surface relief holograms via selective SiO2 deposition on soda-lime silicate glass substrates. Initially, the original hologram was recorded on an azobenzene photosensitive polymer film coated on the soda-lime silicate glass by irradiation with a conventional continuous wave Ar+ laser with a wavelength of 514.5 nm. The hologram was transferred to the soda-lime silicate glass surface via a corona discharge treatment as an index modulation hologram, which was created by partial substitution of protons for sodium ions during the corona discharge treatment in air. After the corona discharge treatment, the polymer film was removed from the substrate. The diffraction efficiency of the index hologram on the soda-lime silicate glass was estimated to be 5.8 × 10-2% at a wavelength of 532 nm. Finally, the glass substrate was subjected to corona discharge treatment in air with vaporized cyclic siloxane. A surface relief hologram with the diffraction efficiency of 2.3% was successfully fabricated on the soda-lime silicate glass."
https://openalex.org/W2913019973,"Group buying (GB) is a popular business model in e-commerce. With the rise of online social media, the positive network effect of buying with others is more important than price discount for consumers to choose GB. However, the negative network effect of GB is also significant for some consumers. In this paper, we classify consumers into two segments considering both positive and negative network effects, and three possible sales strategies as well as their optimal decisions on price are presented. We find that GB strategy dominates individual buying (IB) strategy when the positive network effect is sufficiently high or the proportion of consumers with low valuation is relatively large. We also find that MIX strategy offering both IB and GB is always better than IB, while the relationship between MIX and GB is depending on actual market situations. Some other managerial insights are also discussed."
