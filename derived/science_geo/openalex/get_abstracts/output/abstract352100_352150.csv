https://openalex.org/W2083893864,"Two-dimensional graphene monolayers and bilayers exhibit fascinating electrical transport behaviors. Using infrared spectroscopy, we find that they also have strong interband transitions and that their optical transitions can be substantially modified through electrical gating, much like electrical transport in field-effect transistors. This gate dependence of interband transitions adds a valuable dimension for optically probing graphene band structure. For a graphene monolayer, it yields directly the linear band dispersion of Dirac fermions, whereas in a bilayer, it reveals a dominating van Hove singularity arising from interlayer coupling. The strong and layer-dependent optical transitions of graphene and the tunability by simple electrical gating hold promise for new applications in infrared optics and optoelectronics."
https://openalex.org/W2035340311,"Argonaute (AGO) proteins recruit small RNAs to form the core of RNAi effector complexes. Arabidopsis encodes ten AGO proteins and a large network of small RNAs. How these small RNAs are sorted into specific AGO complexes remains largely unknown. We have cataloged small RNAs resident in four AGO complexes. We found that AGO2 and AGO4 preferentially recruit small RNAs with a 5′ terminal adenosine, whereas AGO1 harbors microRNAs (miRNAs) that favor a 5′ terminal uridine. AGO5 predominantly binds small RNAs that initiate with cytosine. Changing the 5′ terminal nucleotide of an miRNA predictably redirected it into a different AGO complex and alters its biological activity. These results reveal a role for small RNA sequences in assorting among AGO complexes. This suggests that specialization of AGO complexes might involve remodeling the 5′ end-binding pocket to accept certain small RNA sequences, perhaps explaining the evolutionary drive for miRNAs to initiate with uridine."
https://openalex.org/W2168462263,"It is usually assumed that enhanced spiking activity in the form of persistent reverberation for several seconds is the neural correlate of working memory. Here, we propose that working memory is sustained by calcium-mediated synaptic facilitation in the recurrent connections of neocortical networks. In this account, the presynaptic residual calcium is used as a buffer that is loaded, refreshed, and read out by spiking activity. Because of the long time constants of calcium kinetics, the refresh rate can be low, resulting in a mechanism that is metabolically efficient and robust. The duration and stability of working memory can be regulated by modulating the spontaneous activity in the network."
https://openalex.org/W2072003932,"Fertile queens and sterile workers are alternative forms of the adult female honeybee that develop from genetically identical larvae following differential feeding with royal jelly. We show that silencing the expression of DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3, a key driver of epigenetic global reprogramming, in newly hatched larvae led to a royal jelly-like effect on the larval developmental trajectory; the majority of Dnmt3 small interfering RNA-treated individuals emerged as queens with fully developed ovaries. Our results suggest that DNA methylation in Apis is used for storing epigenetic information, that the use of that information can be differentially altered by nutritional input, and that the flexibility of epigenetic modifications underpins, profound shifts in developmental fates, with massive implications for reproductive and behavioral status."
https://openalex.org/W2072613948,"Prion and nonprion forms of proteins are believed to differ solely in their three-dimensional structure, which is therefore of paramount importance for the prion function. However, no atomic-resolution structure of the fibrillar state that is likely infectious has been reported to date. We present a structural model based on solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance restraints for amyloid fibrils from the prion-forming domain (residues 218 to 289) of the HET-s protein from the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina. On the basis of 134 intra- and intermolecular experimental distance restraints, we find that HET-s(218-289) forms a left-handed beta solenoid, with each molecule forming two helical windings, a compact hydrophobic core, at least 23 hydrogen bonds, three salt bridges, and two asparagine ladders. The structure is likely to have broad implications for understanding the infectious amyloid state."

Here, we show that miR390-ARGONAUTE7 complexes function in distinct cleavage or noncleavage modes at two target sites in TAS3a transcripts. The AGO7 cleavage, but not the noncleavage, function could be provided by AGO1, the dominant miRNA-associated AGO, but only when AGO1 was guided to a modified target site through an alternate miRNA. AGO7 was highly selective for interaction with miR390, and miR390 in turn was excluded from association with AGO1 due entirely to an incompatible 5' adenosine. Analysis of AGO1, AGO2, and AGO7 revealed a potent 5' nucleotide discrimination function for some, although not all, ARGONAUTEs. miR390 and AGO7, therefore, evolved as a highly specific miRNA guide/effector protein pair to function at two distinct tasiRNA biogenesis steps."
https://openalex.org/W2005205149,"Edible fruits, such as that of the tomato plant and other vegetable crops, are markedly diverse in shape and size. SUN, one of the major genes controlling the elongated fruit shape of tomato, was positionally cloned and found to encode a member of the IQ67 domain-containing family. We show that the locus arose as a result of an unusual 24.7-kilobase gene duplication event mediated by the long terminal repeat retrotransposon Rider. This event resulted in a new genomic context that increased SUN expression relative to that of the ancestral copy, culminating in an elongated fruit shape. Our discovery demonstrates that retrotransposons may be a major driving force in genome evolution and gene duplication, resulting in phenotypic change in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2081986958,"Olfactory signals are transduced by a large family of odorant receptor proteins, each of which corresponds to a unique glomerulus in the first olfactory relay of the brain. Crosstalk between glomeruli has been proposed to be important in olfactory processing, but it is not clear how these interactions shape the odour responses of second-order neurons. In the Drosophila antennal lobe (a region analogous to the vertebrate olfactory bulb), we selectively removed most interglomerular input to genetically identified second-order olfactory neurons. Here we show that this broadens the odour tuning of these neurons, implying that interglomerular inhibition dominates over interglomerular excitation. The strength of this inhibitory signal scales with total feedforward input to the entire antennal lobe, and has similar tuning in different glomeruli. A substantial portion of this interglomerular inhibition acts at a presynaptic locus, and our results imply that this is mediated by both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors on the same nerve terminal."
https://openalex.org/W1978680232,"Phase coherence is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. Understanding the loss of coherence is paramount for future quantum information processing. We studied the coherent dynamics of a single central spin (a nitrogen-vacancy center) coupled to a bath of spins (nitrogen impurities) in diamond. Our experiments show that both the internal interactions of the bath and the coupling between the central spin and the bath can be tuned in situ, allowing access to regimes with surprisingly different behavior. The observed dynamics are well explained by analytics and numerical simulations, leading to valuable insight into the loss of coherence in spin systems. These measurements demonstrate that spins in diamond provide an excellent test bed for models and protocols in quantum information."
https://openalex.org/W2064088813,"By reconstructing the history of water impoundment in the world's artificial reservoirs, we show that a total of ∼10,800 cubic kilometers of water has been impounded on land to date, reducing the magnitude of global sea level (GSL) rise by –30.0 millimeters, at an average rate of –0.55 millimeters per year during the past half century. This demands a considerably larger contribution to GSL rise from other (natural and anthropogenic) causes than otherwise required. The reconstructed GSL history, accounting for the impact of reservoirs by adding back the impounded water volume, shows an essentially constant rate of rise at +2.46 millimeters per year over at least the past 80 years. This value is contrary to the conventional view of apparently variable GSL rise, which is based on face values of observation."
https://openalex.org/W2088610216,"The metallization of hydrogen directly would require pressure in excess of 400 gigapascals (GPa), out of the reach of present experimental techniques. The dense group IVa hydrides attract considerable attention because hydrogen in these compounds is chemically precompressed and a metallic state is expected to be achievable at experimentally accessible pressures. We report the transformation of insulating molecular silane to a metal at 50 GPa, becoming superconducting at a transition temperature of T c = 17 kelvin at 96 and 120 GPa. The metallic phase has a hexagonal close-packed structure with a high density of atomic hydrogen, creating a three-dimensional conducting network. These experimental findings support the idea of modeling metallic hydrogen with hydrogen-rich alloy."
https://openalex.org/W2067330392,"Scaffold proteins link signaling molecules into linear pathways by physically assembling them into complexes. Scaffolds may also have a higher-order role as signal-processing hubs, serving as the target of feedback loops that optimize signaling amplitude and timing. We demonstrate that the Ste5 scaffold protein can be used as a platform to systematically reshape output of the yeast mating MAP kinase pathway. We constructed synthetic positive- and negative-feedback loops by dynamically regulating recruitment of pathway modulators to an artificial binding site on Ste5. These engineered circuits yielded diverse behaviors: ultrasensitive dose response, accelerated or delayed response times, and tunable adaptation. Protein scaffolds provide a flexible platform for reprogramming cellular responses and could be exploited to engineer cells with novel therapeutic and biotechnological functions."

However, whether phosphorylation promotes or inhibits α-syn aggregation and neurotoxicity in vivo remains unknown. This understanding is critical for elucidating the role of α-syn in the pathogenesis of PD and for development of therapeutic strategies for PD. To better understand the structural and molecular consequences of Ser-129 phosphorylation, we compared the biochemical, structural, and membrane binding properties of wild type α-syn to those of the phosphorylation mimics (S129E, S129D) as well as of in vitro phosphorylated α-syn using a battery of biophysical techniques. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser-129 increases the conformational flexibility of α-syn and inhibits its fibrillogenesis in vitro but does not perturb its membrane-bound conformation. In addition, we show that the phosphorylation mimics (S129E/D) do not reproduce the effect of phosphorylation on the structural and aggregation properties of α-syn in vitro. Our findings have significant implications for current strategies to elucidate the role of phosphorylation in modulating protein structure and function in health and disease and provide novel insight into the underlying mechanisms that govern α-syn aggregation and toxicity in PD and related α-synulceinopathies. α-Synuclein (α-syn) phosphorylation at serine 129 is characteristic of Parkinson disease (PD) and related α-synulceinopathies.

Although the exact function of α-syn remains poorly understood, it is thought to play a role in regulating dopamine neurotransmission (2Abeliovich A. Schmitz Y. Farinas I. Choi-Lundberg D. Ho W.H.

Increasing evidence suggests that phosphorylation may be an important regulator of α-syn oligomerization, fibrillogenesis, Lewy body (LB) formation, and neurotoxicity in vivo (7Chen L. Feany M.B.

Proteinaceous inclusions formed in cellular and animal models overexpressing WT or mutant α-syn can also be stained with an antibody against Ser(P)-129. A study by Fujiwara et al. (8Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) reported that in vitro phosphorylated α-syn (at Ser-129, using casein kinase II (CK2)) forms fibrils more readily than unmodified α-syn. Phosphorylation at Ser-129 was also reported to promote the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in some cell culture models of synucleinopathies (13Smith W.W. Margolis R.L. Li X. Troncoso J.C. Lee M.K. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Iwatsubo T. Ross C.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5544-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggested that phosphorylation at Ser-129 plays an important role in modulating α-syn aggregation, LB formation, and toxicity in vivo. However, in vivo studies by Feany and co-worker (7Chen L. Feany M.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) suggest a lack of correlation between phosphorylation at Ser-129 and the level of α-synfibrillation. Overexpression of the phosphomimic S129D or coexpression of WT α-syn and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (Gprk2), which phosphorylates α-syn specifically at Ser-129, in the Drosophila model of PD results in increased α-syn toxicity without an increase in the number of α-syn inclusions (compared with overexpression of WT α-syn). Interestingly, overexpression of S129A results in a significant increase (4×) in the number of inclusions and suppression of dopaminergic neuronal loss produced by expression of WT human α-syn. We considered that a rigorous examination and comparison of the biochemical and biophysical properties of phosphorylation mimicking mutants (S129A and S129E/D), and WT α-syn may clarify the observations described above as well as the molecular mechanisms by which phosphorylation at Ser-129 may modulate α-syn aggregation and toxicity in vivo. In addition to the phosphorylation mimics, we prepared, purified, and characterized the in vitro phosphorylated Ser(P)-129 form of α-syn. To better understand the role of the phosphate group in modulating α-syn aggregation and membrane binding properties, we compared the structural, oligomerization, fibrillation, and membrane binding properties of WT α-syn to those of the phosphorylation mimics (S129E, S129D) as well as the purified in vitro phosphorylated form of α-syn using NMR, circular dichroism (CD), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), SDS-PAGE, thioflavin T (ThT), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Together our results demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser-129 inhibits rather than promotes α-syn fibril formation in vitro. Equally important is our finding that the phosphorylation mimics (S129E/D) do not reproduce the effect of phosphorylation at this site on α-syn structure and aggregation properties in vitro. These findings have significant implications for modeling synulceinopathies in vivo and our understanding of the role of α-syn in the pathogenesis of PD and related disorders. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of α-Syn Variants—The S129E, S129D, S129A, and S87A α-syn mutants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis employing complementary internal mutagenic primers and two-step PCR. All constructed sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All proteins used in these studies were expressed as previously described (14Kessler J.C. Rochet J.C. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 672-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For the NMR studies, expression and purification of unlabeled and 15N-labeled α-syn were performed as described previously (15Bussell Jr., R. Eliezer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45996-46003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 16Hoyer W. Antony T. Cherny D. Heim G. Jovin T.M. Subramaniam V. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). To enable attachment of a spin label, a single cysteine was introduced into α-syn at position 18 (A18C). The nitroxide spin label chosen for reaction with the cysteine-containing mutant was 1-oxy-2, 2, 5, 5-tetramethyl-d-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate (MTSL, Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). MTSL has already been shown to efficiently react with α-syn cysteine mutants, and the reaction was carried out as described previously (17Bertoncini C.W. Jung Y.S. Fernandez C.O. Hoyer W. Griesinger C. Jovin T.M. Zweckstetter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1430-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation of Recombinant α-Syn—WT or mutant α-syn was phosphorylated by CK1 (New England Biolabs) at a concentration of 1.44 mg/ml (100 μm) unless otherwise stated. The reaction was carried out in the presence of 1.09 mm ATP (Sigma), 1× reaction solution supplied with the enzyme, and 1200 units of CK1/145 μg of α-syn. The phosphorylation reaction was incubated at 30 °C for the stated time points, and the reaction was stopped with EDTA disodium salt (5 mm final concentration) (Axon Lab). The progress of the reaction was monitored by reverse phase HPLC and mass spectrometry. Fibrillation Studies—To probe the effect of CK1 phosphorylation on the aggregation of α-syn, WT α-syn was phosphorylated for 24 h at 30 °C, and the reaction was stopped with EDTA disodium salt before the samples were subjected to fibrillation conditions at 37 °C with continuous shaking for the indicated time points. The unphosphorylated controls were subjected to the same conditions, but CK1 was not added. For fibrillation studies the proteins were dissolved in 20 mm Bis-Tris propane (Aldrich), 100 mm lithium chloride (Aldrich), pH 7.4, at a concentration of 70 μm, and fibril formation was monitored by ThT using an Analyst Fluorescence instrument (LJL Biosystems) as described previously (18Lashuel H.A. Petre B.M. Wall J. Simon M. Nowak R.J. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1089-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Sedimentation and Gel-filtration Separation of Monomeric α-Syn from Fibrillar Material—The degree of α-syn oligomerization was measured by determining the amount of soluble monomeric and oligomeric α-syn in solution at the indicated time points during the aggregation process. 75-μl aliquots withdrawn at the indicated time points from a main α-syn sample incubating at 37 °C were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove any fibrils. The supernatant was then separated from the pelleted fibrils, and 30 μl were injected on an analytical Waters 2795 system equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector and using an analytic Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The supernatant was also run on SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue staining to verify the stability of the protein (see below). Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Immunoblotting—α-Syn samples were diluted in loading buffer and separated on 12% SDS 1-mm gels. Gels were stained with Simply Blue safe stain (Invitrogen) or silver staining (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For dot blot analysis, the proteins were deposited onto nitrocellulose membrane (Omnilab SA), and the membrane was blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-COR Biosciences GmbH) diluted 1:3 in PBS (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was probed with the primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-α-syn (121-125) (211) at a dilution of 1:500 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse anti-α-syn (15-123) at a dilution of 1:1000 (BD Transduction) or mouse monoclonal anti-phosphorylated α-syn Ser-129 at a dilution of 1:5000 (Wako) or rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphorylated α-syn Ser-87 at a dilution of 1:100) at room temperature for 1-2 h. After 4 PBST (PBS, 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 (Fluka)) washes, the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody (i.e. goat anti-mouse ALEXA Fluor 680) protected from light at room temperature for 1 h. The immunoblot was finally washed 4 times with PBST and 3 times with PBS and scanned in a Li-COR scanner at a wavelength of 700 nm. TEM—For TEM studies, WT or mutant α-syn samples were deposited on Formvar-coated 200 mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) at a concentration of 25 μm. Grids were washed with 2 drops of water and stained with 2 drops of freshly prepared 0.75% (w/v) uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Specimens were inspected on a Philip CIME 12 electron microscope, operated at 80 kV. Digitized photographs were recorded with a slow scan CCD camera (Gatan, Model 679). Reverse Phase HPLC—Monitoring the phosphorylation reaction and purification of the various phosphorylated species of α-syn (i.e. monophosphorylated or diphosphorylated α-syn) was accomplished using reverse phase HPLC on a Waters 2795 instrument equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector and using an analytical (4.6-mm inner diameter) or semi-preparative (10-mm inner diameter) C4 or C18-RP column (Vydac). A 35-50% linear gradient over (flow rate = 1 ml/min) (0.09% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (solution A), 90% (v/v) acetonitrile aqueous solution (solution B)) was applied, and the signal was monitored at 214 nm. In the case of the semi-preparative reverse phase HPLC, a 40-60% linear gradient over (flow rate = 5 ml/min) solution A, solution B was applied. Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles and Small Unilamellar Vesicles and α-Syn-Liposome Complexes—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (sodium salt) (POPG) (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) was purchased in chloroform which was removed by evaporation and lyophilization. The residual phospholipid was hydrated with 50 mm HEPES (Fluka), 150 mm NaCl (Fluka), pH 7.4, solution, giving rise to a phospholipid suspension of 10 mg/ml. To increase the efficiency of large unilamellar vesicles formation, 10 cycles of freezing in dry ice and thawing at 37 °C water bath were carried out. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared by extrusion through a 100-nm polycarbonate membrane (Avestin Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The small unilamellar vesicles were stored at 4 °C and used within 3-5 days. The appropriate amount and volume of α-syn in PBS or sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, was mixed with the appropriate volume of POPG to generate a mass ratio of α-syn:POPG of 1:20. The α-syn-liposome complex was incubated for 2 h at room temperature before CD spectroscopy. Circular Dichroism—The average secondary structure of monomeric α-syn was determined by CD spectroscopy using a Jasco 810 Spectrometer. The Far UV-CD spectra (190-250 nm, integration time of 2 s for 0.2 nm) were collected at room temperature in a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette containing 0.1 mg/ml of α-syn in PBS or sodium phosphate buffer. Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—For two layer sample preparation, MALDI matrices and calibrants were from Sigma/Fluka (Schnelldorf, Germany), trifluoroacetic acid was from Pierce, and sinapinic acid and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid were from Fluka. Cytochrome c and apomyoglobin were from Sigma. 2-μl aliquots of each collected peaks were reserved for the MALDI analysis. A two-layer sample preparation was selected for the molecular weight analysis. Two matrix solutions were prepared; a saturated solution of sinapinic acid in methanol (matrix solution 1) and a 14 mg/ml sinapinic acid solution in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, acetonitrile (1/1) (matrix solution 2). A thin matrix layer was first generated on the mirror-polished target using a gel loader tip with matrix solution 1. 1 μl of sample was mixed with 1 μl of sinapinic acid matrix solution, and 0.8 μl of this mixture was deposited on top of the thin layer and allowed to air dry. Samples were deposited twice and analyzed with a 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument (Applied Biosystems). 8000 laser shots were typically summed by random sampling of the surface to generate the spectra that were calibrated externally on the pseudomolecular peak of cytochrome c, and apomyoglobin was prepared with the same matrix and deposited close to the samples. NMR—NMR samples of free α-syn contained ∼0.1 mm 15N-labeled WT or mutant α-syn in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl. NMR experiments were acquired on Bruker Avance 600 and 700 MHz NMR spectrometers. The temperature was set to 15 °C. At higher temperatures, NMR resonances particularly in the N-terminal domain were broadened. NMR data were processed and analyzed using NMRPipe (19Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and Sparky 3 (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco) and NMR-View (20Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). Spectra were referenced indirectly to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate and ammonia using the known chemical shift of water. Tentative assignments for the spectra of mutant and phosphorylated proteins were obtained by transferring each previously assigned cross-peak in the 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of the WT protein to the nearest unassigned cross-peak in each new spectrum. Subsequently, they were verified by three-dimensional HNHA and three-dimensional NOE-HSQC spectra. Normalized weighted average chemical shift differences for amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts were calculated according to Δav = [(Δδ2HN +Δδ2N/25)/2]1/2. 3J(HN,Hα) scalar couplings were measured in WT α-syn, phosphorylated S87A α-syn, and S129D α-syn using intensity modulated HSQC experiments. Pulse field gradient NMR experiments were acquired on unlabeled WT and mutant α-syn (200 μm) dissolved in 99.9% D2O, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and containing dioxane (∼20 mm) as an internal radius standard and viscosity probe (21Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Twenty one-dimensional 1H spectra were collected as a function of gradient amplitude employing the PG-SLED sequence (21Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 22Jones J.A. Wilkins D.K. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 199-203Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated at least twice. The gradient strength was increased from 1.69 to 33.72 Gauss/cm in a linear manner. Each 1H spectrum comprised 32 scans plus 16 steady-state scans. 16,000 complex points were acquired with a spectral width of 6000 Hz. Signals corresponding to the aliphatic region of the 1H spectra (3.3-0.5 ppm) were integrated, and diffusion data (signal intensity versus gradient strength) were fitted to Gaussian functions using XWINNMR (Bruker Instruments, Karlsruhe, Germany). Stokes radii of α-syn were calculated from the apparent diffusion coefficients of α-syn and dioxane and the known Stokes radius of dioxane (22Jones J.A. Wilkins D.K. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 199-203Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Errors in stokes radii estimated from repeat measurements are about 0.3 Å. For WT and phosphorylated S87A α-syn, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement profiles were derived from the measurement of peak intensity ratios between two 1H,15N HSQC spectra in the presence (Ipar) and absence (Idia) of the nitroxide radical. NMR for SDS Micelle-bound α-Syn—NMR experiments on SDS micelle-bound α-syn were performed on samples containing 120 μm α-syn. Lyophilized S87A, either unphosphorylated or phosphorylated, was dissolved in sample buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, in 90%, 10% H2O, D2O) with 40 mm SDS. Two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA spectrometer operating at a 1H resonance frequency of 600MHz and a sample temperature of 40 °C for all samples. Generation of Ser(P)-129 and the Phosphomimics S129E/D—The structural and electrostatic similarities between Glu/Asp and phospho-Ser suggest that this type of substitution represents a reasonable approach to mimic constitutive phosphorylation at a specific Ser residue (Fig. 1A). The phosphate moiety at pH 7 exists predominately in the fully deprotonated state, resulting in a net charge of -2, in contrast to the single negative charge contributed by Glu/Asp. To determine whether a substitution of Ser-129 by an acidic residue is sufficient to mimic the effect of phosphorylation, we prepared mutants in which Ser-129 was replaced by Glu (S129E) or Asp (S129D). To provide mechanistic insight into the in vivo studies performed with the phosphorylation mimics, the S129A variant was also prepared. The S129E, S129D, and S129A mutations were introduced within the human cDNA sequence of SNCA by two-step PCR mutagenesis, and the mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to greater than 95% homogeneity, as verified by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. To determine whether mutation of Ser-129 into a charged residue is sufficient to reproduce the effect of phosphorylation on the structural and aggregation properties of α-syn in vitro, we prepared the Ser(P)-129 α-syn using CK1. We found that CK1 phosphorylates α-syn more efficiently than casein kinase II (supplemental Fig. 2). To block CK1-mediated phosphorylation at Ser-87, the S87A mutant of α-syn was expressed, purified, and phosphorylated in vitro to generate S87A/Ser(P)-129 α-syn (supplemental Fig. 3). To verify that phosphorylation by CK1 occurs at Ser-129, we made use of the anti-phospho-Ser-129 antibody (supplemental Fig. 4). Ser(P)-129 can be detected as early as the first 3 h of incubation (data not shown) and increases with time and increasing CK1 concentration. α-Syn Is Disordered Independent of Phosphorylation—To elucidate the consequences of phosphorylation on the structure and dynamics of monomeric α-syn, we performed a series of CD measurements and high resolution NMR studies. NMR resonances in 1H,15N HSQC spectra of WT and S87A α-syn, unphosphorylated and phosphorylated, were recorded at 15 °C. For all proteins, the resonances were sharp and showed only a limited dispersion of chemical shifts, reflecting a high degree of backbone mobility (Fig. 1). Chemical shifts in WT and S87A α-syn in the unphosphorylated form were highly similar except in direct vicinity of the mutation site (supplemental Fig. 4). Upon phosphorylation of WT α-syn by CK1, the resonances of Ser-87 and Ser-129 were strongly attenuated at the position seen in the HSQC of the unphosphorylated protein. At the same time, new signals appeared in the region in which resonances of phosphorylated amino acids are usually found (Figs. 1, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 1). Three-dimensional NMR spectra assigned the new signals to Ser-87 and Ser-129. For S87A α-syn, phosphorylation at Ser-87 was blocked such that only the resonance of Ser-129 was attenuated at its original position and appeared at its phosphorylated position (Fig. 1D). Other chemical shift changes induced by phosphorylation were generally small. Detailed analysis, however, showed that the chemical shifts of residues down to residue 90 were influenced by phosphorylation of Ser-129 in S87A α-syn. In addition, weak chemical shift changes were observed for the 60 N-terminal residues (Fig. 2C) in S87A α-syn, in agreement with recent studies (23Sasakawa H. Sakata E. Yamaguchi Y. Masuda M. Mori T. Kurimoto E. Iguchi T. Hisanaga S.I. Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. Kato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 363: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 3J(HN,Hα) scalar couplings are highly sensitive to the dihedral angles of the protein backbone. We measured 3J(HN,Hα) couplings in WT α-syn and phosphorylated S87A α-syn. 3J(HN,Hα) couplings were mostly close to their random coil values and were very similar for unphosphorylated WT and phosphorylated Ser-87α-syn (data not shown), indicating that phosphorylation has no apparent effect on the secondary structure of α-syn. Far UV-CD spectra of unphosphorylated WT, S129E, S129D, S129A, and S87A α-syn and phosphorylated WT and S87A α-syn were virtually identical and consistent with a predominantly random coil structure (Figs. 1B and 3). Phosphorylation Expands the Ensemble of Conformations Populated by α-Syn—Pulse field gradient NMR experiments allow accurate determination of the diffusion coefficient of a molecule. From the diffusion coefficient, a hydrodynamic radius Rh can be calculated that provides an estimation of the overall dimensions of a biomolecule. For WT α-syn, we determined a hydrodynamic radius of 28.2 Å (Fig. 2A). Upon the addition of 8 m urea, it increased to 36.4 Å. For S87A α-syn, the corresponding values were 28.1 and 36.2 Å, respectively. If α-syn were a true random coil, a hydrodynamic radius of 36.9 Å would be expected. When WT α-syn was phosphorylated, its hydrodynamic radius increased by 7.1 to 35.3 Å (Fig. 2A). Similarly, phosphorylation of S87A α-syn at Ser-129 increased Rh by 6.6 to 34.7 Å (Fig. 2A). The addition of 8 m urea to phosphorylated S87A α-syn only slightly further increased the Rh value to 35.6 Å, indicating that phosphorylation extends the ensemble of conformations populated by α-syn close to its fully random coil-like dimensions. Phosphorylation Disrupts Transient Intramolecular Long-range Interactions—To probe the effect of phosphorylation on transient long-range interactions, we measured paramagnetic relaxation enhancement of NMR resonances. The interactions between a specifically attached paramagnetic nitroxide radical and nearby (less than ∼25 Å) protons cause broadening of their NMR signals because of an increase in transverse relaxation rate (24Gillespie J.R. Shortle D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This effect has an r-6 dependence on the electron-proton distance and, thus, allows the measurement of long-range distances between the spin label and the affected amide protons in proteins (25Kosen P.A. Scheek R.M. Naderi H. Basus V.J. Manogaran S. Schmidt P.G. Oppenheimer N.J. Kuntz I.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2356-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because the primary sequence of α-syn lacks cysteine, Ala-18 was mutated into a cysteine to provide an attachment point for the nitroxide radical MTSL. Neither the mere introduction of the mutation nor the addition of the MTSL radical modified the hydrodynamic radius or altered the time course of aggregation for α-syn (17Bertoncini C.W. Jung Y.S.

Its mechanism of action and molecular target remain unknown. Here, we show that DEET blocks electrophysiological responses of olfactory sensory neurons to attractive odors in Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster . DEET inhibits behavioral attraction to food odors in Drosophila , and this inhibition requires the highly conserved olfactory co-receptor OR83b. DEET inhibits odor-evoked currents mediated by the insect odorant receptor complex, comprising a ligand-binding subunit and OR83b. We conclude that DEET masks host odor by inhibiting subsets of heteromeric insect odorant receptors that require the OR83b co-receptor. The identification of candidate molecular targets for the action of DEET may aid in the design of safer and more effective insect repellents."

However, characterizing the gas composition in the planet formation region of disks has been a challenge to date. We report here that the protoplanetary disk within 3 astronomical units of AA Tauri possesses a rich molecular emission spectrum in the mid-infrared, indicating a high abundance of simple organic molecules (HCN, C 2 H 2 , and CO 2 ), water vapor, and OH. These results suggest that water is abundant throughout the inner disk and that the disk supports an active organic chemistry."

V., Ricci, M. S., Dillon, T. M., and Balland, A. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 16194–16205), we have identified that the human IgG2 subclass exists as an ensemble of distinct isoforms, designated IgG2-A, -B, and -A/B, which differ by the disulfide connectivity at the hinge region. In this report, we studied the structural and functional properties of the IgG2 disulfide isoforms and compared them to IgG1. Human monoclonal IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies were designed with identical antigen binding regions, specific to interleukin-1 cell surface receptor type 1. In vitro biological activity measurements showed an increased activity of the IgG1 relative to the IgG2 in blocking interleukin-1β ligand from binding to the receptor, suggesting that some of the IgG2 isoforms had lower activity. Under reduction-oxidation conditions, the IgG2 disulfide isoforms converted to IgG2-A when 1 m guanidine was used, whereas IgG2-B was enriched in the absence of guanidine. The relative potency of the antibodies in cell-based assays was: IgG1 > IgG2-A > IgG2 ≫ IgG2-B. This difference correlated with an increased hydrodynamic radius of IgG2-A relative to IgG2-B, as shown by biophysical characterization. The enrichment of disulfide isoforms and activity studies were extended to additional IgG2 monoclonal antibodies with various antigen targets. All IgG2 antibodies displayed the same disulfide conversion, but only a subset showed activity differences between IgG2-A and IgG2-B. Additionally, the distribution of isoforms was influenced by the light chain type, with IgG2λ composed mostly of IgG2-A. Based on crystal structure analysis, we propose that IgG2 disulfide exchange is caused by the close proximity of several cysteine residues at the hinge and the reactivity of tandem cysteines within the hinge. Furthermore, the IgG2 isoforms were shown to interconvert in whole blood or a “blood-like” environment, thereby suggesting that the in vivo activity of human IgG2 may be dependent on the distribution of isoforms. In the accompanying report (Wypych, J., Li, M., Guo, A., Zhang, Z., Martinez, T., Allen, M. J., Fodor, S., Kelner, D. N., Flynn, G. C., Liu, Y. D., Bondarenko, P. V., Ricci, M. S., Dillon, T.

Recombinant monoclonal antibodies, typically human or humanized, are used as protein-based therapeutic agents because of their high degree of specificity and the ability to alter their functional properties when desired. In vivo, therapeutic antibodies can function via several mechanisms, including as antagonists that compete with ligand binding and interfere with receptor response, as signaling molecules that elicit a response in the target cells (e.g. apoptosis), or as agents that target specific cells populations (1Brekke O.H. Sandlie I. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The latter mechanism may involve attaching an effector moiety (e.g. enzymes, toxins, and radionuclides) to the antibody or using the antibody's natural effector functions, which are mediated through the immunoglobulin Fc domain. These natural functions include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and activation of the complement cascade, leading to complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Effector functions have been shown to be dependent on the immunoglobulin γ (IgG) subclass affinity for Fc receptors (IgG1 > IgG3 > IgG4 > IgG2) (2Burton D. Mol. Immunol. 1985; 22: 161-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 3Canfield S.M. Morrison S.L. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and this feature serves as a common determinant for therapeutic use. The human IgG2 subclass in particular has emerged as an attractive framework for therapeutic antibodies in clinical applications for which effector functions are undesirable or unnecessary for therapeutic activity (4Beenhouwer D.O. Yoo E.M. Lai C.W. Rocha M.A. Morrison S.L. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 1424-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 5Jefferis R. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2007; 7: 1401-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The increased prevalence of therapeutic IgGs has led to a renewed interest in understanding antibody structure and its relationship to biological function. Structural heterogeneity in proteins can result from genetic differences or from many common post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, protein folding, disulfide bond formation, and chemical modifications to amino acid side chains or the peptide backbone (6Liu, H., Gaza-Bulseco, G., Faldu, D., Chumsae, C., and Sun, J. (2008) J. Pharm. Sci., in pressGoogle Scholar). For example, structural changes caused by glycan variants have been shown to impact antigen binding and antibody effector functions (7Matsumiya S. Yamaguchi Y. Saito J. Nagano M. Sasakawa H. Otaki S. Satoh M. Shitara K. Kato K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 8Arnold J.N. Wormald M.R. Sim R.B.

Other examples demonstrate how cysteinylation of cysteines and incomplete disulfide bond formation in antibodies can interfere with antigen recognition and ultimately lead to reduced binding or inactivity (11Banks D.D. Gadgil H.S. Pipes G.D. Bondarenko P.V. Hobbs V. Scavezze J.L. Kim J. Jiang X.R. Mukku V. Dillon T.M. J. Pharm. Sci. 2008; 97: 775-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Chaderjian W.B. Chin E.T. Harris R.J. Etcheverry T.M. Biotechnol. Prog. 2005; 21: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Disulfide heterogeneity of human IgG4 molecules represents a clear example of how unstable disulfide bonds can disrupt the structural integrity of an antibody, generating half-molecule forms. In this case, the half-molecule IgG4 is still capable of specific binding, although in a diminished capacity due to the loss of multivalent binding. Disulfide bond formation is a post-translational process that can affect the structure and function of proteins. Incomplete or incorrect disulfide bonds have the potential to generate improperly folded proteins. Although disulfide heterogeneity is less common in mammalian expression systems possessing the proper intra-cellular redox environment and post-translational machinery for protein folding, incomplete or improper disulfide bond formation of bacterially expressed mammalian proteins is commonly observed. Restoring native disulfide bonds in these proteins (often produced as inclusion bodies or soluble aggregates) has typically been accomplished by solubilization in the presence of a high concentration chaotropic agent, typically 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl), followed by exposure to redox agents while slowly decreasing the concentration of the chaotrope (13Lilie H. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Additionally, redox procedures without chaotropic agents have been used for Fc fusion proteins and antibodies produced in mammalian cells (12Chaderjian W.B. Chin E.T. Harris R.J. Etcheverry T.M. Biotechnol. Prog. 2005; 21: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Sassenfeld, H. M., Remmele, R. L., and McCoy, R. E. (Sep. 6, 2002) World Patent Cooperation Treaty, Patent Application WO 02/068455A3Google Scholar), primarily to modify the disulfide structure without denaturing the proteins and improve binding to their targets. In the companion report (15Wypych J. Li M. Guo A. Zhang Z. Martinez T. Allen M.J. Fodor S. Kelner D.N. Flynn G.C. Liu Y.D. Bondarenko P.V. Ricci M.S. Dillon T.M. Balland A. J. Biol.

In the first part, thorough covalent characterization of the IgG2 disulfide isoforms has been presented. In this study, we describe a redox procedure for enrichment of the IgG2 disulfide isoforms utilizing a relatively low concentration of GuHCl. We investigated the individual biophysical properties of the human IgG2 isoforms, their potency, and the mechanism of disulfide conversion. Materials—Recombinant human monoclonal IgG antibodies were produced from Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified using well established purification protocols (16Shukla A.A. Hubbard B. Tressel T. Guhan S. Low D.J. J. Chromatogr. B. 2007; 848: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) at Amgen. The purified proteins were stored in a formulation buffer at 4 °C. Unless otherwise noted, the same representative mAb expressed as an IgG1κ versus IgG2κ construct was used throughout this study. Antibodies purified from human plasma were purchased from Sigma and ICN biochemicals. The antibodies were purified from human plasma using well established purification protocols, which generally include acid precipitation of non-IgG proteins, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and affinity chromatography. Reversed-phase Chromatography—An Agilent 1100 HPLC system with a binary pump was equipped with a UV detector and an autosampler. The proteins were injected onto a Zorbax 300SB C8 column (150 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) operated at 75 °C. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Mobile-phase A was water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mobile-phase B was 70% isopropyl alcohol, 20% acetonitrile, and aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were injected at a loading condition of 10% B and increased to 19% B over 2 min. A linear elution gradient of 1.1% B/min started at 2 min and ended at 24 min. The column was then flushed for 5 min with 95% B. The column was reequilibrated with the loading condition for 5 min. Size-exclusion Chromatography—An Agilent 1100 HPLC system with a binary pump was equipped with a UV detector and an autosampler. The proteins were injected onto two Tosoh Bioscience TSK-Gel G3000 SWxl columns in series (7.8 mm × 300 mm, 5-μm particles) operated at 25 °C. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. The mobile phase contained 100 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm sodium chloride, 5% ethanol, pH 7.0. Sedimentation Velocity Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The solution properties of the IgG2 isoforms were evaluated by sedimentation velocity measurements conducted with a temperature-controlled Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an An-60 Ti rotor and a photoelectric scanner (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Samples were diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in the desired buffer (see Fig. 6). Protein samples were loaded in a double sector cell equipped with a 12-mm Epon centerpiece and a sapphire optical window. The reference compartment was loaded with the matching buffer. The samples were monitored at 280 nm at a rotor speed of 40,000 rpm at 20 °C. Analyses of the raw data were completed using Sedfit v. 8.9 to obtain concentration distribution (c(s)) as a function of sedimentation coefficient. A confidence level of 0.7 (1 standard deviation) was used for the analysis. Meniscus and frictional ratio (f/f0) were fitted. Other fitting parameters used were default parameters suggested by Sedfit software. Replicate runs showed standard deviation of average sedimentation coefficients of <0.01 s. Partial specific volume for each antibody, buffer density, and buffer viscosity were calculated using Sednterp (v. 1.08) and used for hydrodynamic radii calculations. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Samples were analyzed using a MicroCal VP-Capillary differential scanning calorimeter system. All samples were diluted to 1 mg/ml in acetate buffer at pH 5. A scan rate of 1 °C/min was used. Redox Treatment—To enrich for IgG2-B and IgG2-A, the antibodies were incubated at 3 mg/ml in two buffers: 1) 200 mm Tris buffer at pH 8.0; 2) 200 mm Tris buffer at pH 8.0 with 0.9 m GuHCl. A combination of cysteine and cystamine was added at concentrations of 6 mm to 1 mm. The ratios of redox reagents were determined by testing multiple conditions and monitoring for optimal IgG2 isoform conversion by reversed-phase chromatography. Several redox reagents listed in a previous study (14Sassenfeld, H. M., Remmele, R. L., and McCoy, R. E. (Sep. 6, 2002) World Patent Cooperation Treaty, Patent Application WO 02/068455A3Google Scholar) and their ratios were evaluated before choosing the above conditions. The samples were protected from light and placed at 2-8 °C for 24-48 h. Chondrocyte Bioassay—The anti-IL-1RI IgG samples were serially diluted from 400 nm to 1.5 pm in assay media. The diluted test antibodies (50 μl) were added to the wells of 96-well plates seeded with human chondrocytes at a density of 10,000 cells/well in a 100-μl volume. The final antibody concentration ranged from 100 nm to 0.38 pm. After a 30-min incubation, 50 μl of recombinant human IL-1β was added to a final concentration of 10 pm. After incubation overnight, the antibody activities were analyzed using an IL-6 immunoassay with electrochemiluminescence detection (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD). The inhibition of IL-6 production was calculated as a percentage of maximum IL-1β activity. The inhibition-response curve for each test antibody was established, and the corresponding IC50 values (the concentration of antibody which reduces the signal by 50%) were derived using GraphPad Prism software. IL-1β-induced IL-6 Human Whole Blood Bioassay—The anti-IL-1RI IgG samples were evaluated in 50% human whole blood (final concentration) from 10 nm to 0.30 pm in half-log increments for a 10-point IC50 curve. After a 45-min preincubation with anti-IL-1RI IgG samples, the blood was stimulated with recombinant IL-1β for a final concentration of 30 pm (∼IC50). After incubation overnight, the antibody activities were analyzed using an IL-6 immunoassay with electrochemiluminescence detection (Meso Scale Discovery). The inhibition of IL-6 production was calculated as a percentage of maximum IL-1β activity. IC50 values were calculated using six separate donors (three donors on two different days). Statistical Analysis—Bioassay data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism. IC50 values were derived by nonlinear regression (variable slope). Where dose-response curves were incomplete, the bottom was constrained to zero. Significance was calculated using a one-way analysis of variance with a Tukey multiple comparison post-test. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Crystal Structure Analysis—Display and measurements were made using the DeepView/Swiss-Pdb-Viewer version 3.7. Structural Heterogeneity of Human IgG2 and Homogeneity of IgG1 by RP-HPLC—RP-HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry has emerged as an effective analytical tool for characterizing and monitoring structural heterogeneity of antibodies (17Dillon T.M. Bondarenko P.V. Ricci M.S. J. Chromatogr. A. 2004; 1053: 299-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dillon T.M. Bondarenko P.V. Rehder D.S. Pipes G.D. Kleemann G.R. Ricci M.S. J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1120: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In this study, several human IgG1 (Fig. 1, k-q) and IgG2 (Fig. 1, a-j) antibodies were analyzed generating the RP-HPLC profiles shown in Fig. 1. The IgG2 molecules consistently produced heterogeneous profiles for both monoclonal (Fig. 1, a-f) and endogenous antibodies purified from human serum (Fig. 1, g-j), whereas those of IgG1 were homogeneous. Furthermore, IgG2 antibodies containing kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) LC differed in their RP-HPLC profile. Both antibodies displayed a characteristic four-peak profile but displayed a different abundance of the earliest eluting peak. These results clearly show the inherent differences between the IgG1 and IgG2 subclass in addition to subtle variations among the LC type of IgG2. To further study the effects of this structural phenomenon, monoclonal IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies were designed with identical antigen binding regions, specific to interleukin-1 cell surface receptor type 1 (IL-1RI) (supplemental Fig. S1). The most significant differences between the human IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses are the primary structure of the hinge and two serine to cysteine substitutions (Ser → Cys) in IgG2 (Table 1). The IgG2 upper hinge sequence is three amino acids shorter than that of IgG1 and contains a cysteine substitution at position 219. Additionally, the CH1 loop of the IgG2 HC has a cysteine substitution at position 131 that is available for disulfide bonding to the LC. Although the overall IgG1 and IgG2 amino acid sequences are 95% identical, the proteins exhibited significant structural differences, as determined by the RP-HPLC analysis (Fig. 2). As shown in the accompanying report, the heterogeneity in the RP-HPLC profile was a result of disulfide linkage differences in the IgG2s (15Wypych J. Li M. Guo A. Zhang Z. Martinez T. Allen M.J. Fodor S. Kelner D.N. Flynn G.C. Liu Y.D. Bondarenko P.V. Ricci M.S. Dillon T.M. Balland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16194-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Therefore, as expected, high resolution mass spectral analysis in-line with RP-HPLC found the calculated molecular weight values of the four chromatographic peaks to be identical (data not shown) (18Dillon T.M.

Interestingly, the individual RP-HPLC peaks displayed unique mass spectral features, suggesting underlying structural differences. We measured the number of protons on the surface of each of the RP-HPLC peaks to be different (supplemental Fig. S2), according to the method initially proposed by Chait and coworkers (19Chowdhury S.K. Katta V. Chait B.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9012-9013Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The results indicated that peak 1 had decreased solvent exposure and a more compact structure while peaks 2-4 showed an increased solvent exposure with a larger number of protons on the antibody surface and a more open structure.TABLE 1Human IgG1 and IgG2 sequence alignments of the CH1 loop and upper hinge of the HCEu #128129130131132133134135136137138IgG1LeuAlaProSerSerLysSerThrSerGlyGlyIgG2LeuAlaProCysSerArgSerThrSerGluSerEu #219220221222223224225226227228229IgG1SerCysAspLysThrHisThrCysProProCysIgG2CysCysValGluCysProProCys Open table in a new tab Biological Activity of IgG1 and IgG2 Anti-IL1-R1—IgG1 and IgG2 constructs were designed to compete with the IL-1β ligand, thereby inhibiting IL-1-mediated cellular events, including the production of IL-6 (20Guerne P.A. Carson D.A. Lotz M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 499-505PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1RI is present on the surface of many cell types, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, T cells, and chondrocytes. In response to IL-1, chondrocytes switch from synthesizing cartilage matrix molecules such as collagens and proteoglycans to releasing matrix degrading molecules like matrix metalloproteinases, leading to cartilage degradation (21McInnes I.B. Schett G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Biological activity of the anti-IL-1RI IgG1 and IgG2 mAbs were assessed by monitoring the inhibition of IL-1β-induced IL-6 production by primary human chondrocytes. The results of the bioassays showed statistically significant differences in IL-6 inhibition (Fig. 3) with the IgG2 having approximately one-third of the IgG1 potency. This raised the question of whether the lower IgG2 mAb potency was due to the disulfide heterogeneity, as observed by RP-HPLC. Ideally, the RP-HPLC peaks would be collected and tested for potency, but because the RP-HPLC assay utilizes denaturing conditions (high temperature, organic solvent, and low pH), the collected fractions would not retain native structure and function. Therefore, a different assay using nondenaturing conditions was needed. Fractionation of the disulfide heterogeneity was attempted by cation exchange (CEX) chromatography, which has been shown to partially resolve IgG2 disulfide isoforms (15Wypych J. Li M. Guo A. Zhang Z. Martinez T. Allen M.J. Fodor S. Kelner D.N. Flynn G.C. Liu Y.D. Bondarenko P.V. Ricci M.S. Dillon T.M. Balland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16194-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). When the collected CEX fractions were analyzed by RP-HPLC, they showed low purity (<50%) of the isoforms. However, differences in activity were observed that correlated with differences in the disulfide isoforms. The normalized potencies (IC50) of CEX fractions ranged from 70 ± 13% to 125 ± 12% (data not shown). Although not definitive, these results indicated that this naturally occurring structural heterogeneity affects the bioactivity of the antibody. To confirm these results, a more efficient enrichment technique was sought. Reduction-oxidation (Redox) Treatment of IgG2—Redox treatment of proteins from the inclusion body state is a common practice in the microbial production of recombinant proteins but is not typically implemented in mammalian cell production. However, because the IgG2 isoforms were discovered to be disulfide-mediated, the reactivity of the isoforms to redox treatment was tested. In the example shown, the anti-IL-1RI IgG2 mAb was subjected to a variety of redox conditions in the presence and absence of GuHCl. By changing the redox treatment conditions, either RP-HPLC peak 1 or peak 3 could preferentially be enriched (Fig. 4). Peak 1 was redox-enriched without using GuHCl, and peak 3 was enriched using ∼1 m GuHCl, a concentration well below that known to affect overall secondary or tertiary structure of the antibody (11Banks D.D. Gadgil H.S. Pipes G.D. Bondarenko P.V. Hobbs V. Scavezze J.L. Kim J. Jiang X.R. Mukku V. Dillon T.M. J. Pharm.

Biol. 2006; 361: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The major RP-HPLC peaks in the redox-treated materials eluted at approximately the same retention times as peaks in the untreated (no redox) IgG2 control material. Full characterization of IgG2 heterogeneity by RP-HPLC has been previously completed by performing nonreduced peptide mapping on collected RP-HPLC fractions (15Wypych J. Li M. Guo A. Zhang Z. Martinez T. Allen M.J. Fodor S. Kelner D.N. Flynn G.C. Liu Y.D. Bondarenko P.V. Ricci M.S. Dillon T.M. Balland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16194-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). That characterization showed that the RP-HPLC method was able to resolve three unique disulfide structures in the elution order of IgG2-B (peak 1), IgG2-A/B (peak 2), and IgG2-A (peaks 3-4). The RP-HPLC elution profiles suggested that the two redox procedures preferentially enrich for the newly discovered IgG2 isoforms (IgG2-A and IgG2-B). Additionally, several other IgG2 mAbs with alternative antigen targets were redox-treated using similar conditions (supplemental Fig. S3). These results showed that all IgG2 mAbs tested were reactive to redox treatment. The redox-enriched isoforms showed no further conversion after being removed from the redox solution and stored in a PBS solution. To confirm the identity of the redox-enriched IgG2 isoforms, nonreduced peptide mapping was performed on the redoxtreated material and IgG2 control material (supplemental Fig. S4) using the earlier described protocols for nonreduced peptide mapping and mass spectrometry identification. The analysis confirmed that the redox procedures were able to enrich for two of the IgG2 isoforms (IgG2-A and IgG2-B) that were previously shown to exist in the IgG2 control material (15Wypych J. Li M. Guo A. Zhang Z. Martinez T. Allen M.J. Fodor S. Kelner D.N. Flynn G.C. Liu Y.D. Bondarenko P.V. Ricci M.S. Dillon T.M. Balland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16194-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Therefore, redox treatment of the IgG2 antibodies did not introduce new disulfide forms but effectively populated structural isoforms already present within the control material. Based on the above results, the IgG2 disulfide isoforms were classified into three predominant structures, IgG2-A, -B, and -A/B (Fig. 5), defined by their disulfide connectivity. The structures differed by their interchain disulfide attachment of LC to the CH1 region or to the hinge. Two of the isoforms (IgG2-A and IgG2-B) contained symmetrical interchain disulfide connectivity in that the same light-to-heavy chain (LC-HC) attachment was present on both sides of the molecule (Fig. 5). In the third isoform (IgG2-A/B), one light chain was connected to CH1, whereas the other was connected to the hinge, which made it an asymmetrical disulfide structure. The IgG2-A/B disulfide form was an intermediate of the A and B forms. Biophysical Characterization of Redox-enriched Isoforms—The structural and thermodynamic properties of the redox-enriched isoforms (IgG2-A and IgG2-B) were compared using a series of biophysical assays. These tests included far UV CD, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation, and differential scanning calorimetry. Far-UV CD analysis was used to assess the overall secondary structure of the antibody. Comparison of the individual CD spectra for each of the enriched IgG2 isoforms and IgG2 control material showed no significant difference in secondary structure (data not shown). SEC analysis, which separates based on hydrodynamic radius, was used to assess the apparent molecular sizes of the IgG2 isoforms. The enriched isoforms and the control material generated similar peak shapes but eluted at slightly different retention times (Fig. 6a). The enriched IgG2-A eluted earlier than IgG2-B, with the untreated sample, containing a mixture of the isoforms, eluting at an intermediate time. These results suggested that IgG2-A had a larger apparent molecular size than IgG2-B. An alternate explanation of the retention time shift is that the isoforms were differentially interacting with the column matrix due to differences in solvent exposed surface area or hydrophobicity. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation was therefore used as an orthogonal technique to investigate the hydrodynamic properties of the disulfide isoforms. Similar to the SEC data, the sedimentation coefficient distribution was unique for each of the IgG2 isoforms analyzed in various buffers (Fig. 6b). The enriched IgG2-B isoform consistently showed a greater sedimentation coefficient (s) value than IgG2-A, supporting the SEC assessment of a more compact conformation for IgG2-B. In addition, the thermal stability of IgG2-A and IgG2-B was tested using differential scanning calor"

The strategy is based on the synthesis of a triblock copolymer ABC, in which the long central block B is extended by two short A and C sequences bearing reactive antagonist functions. When reacted under highly dilute conditions, this precursor produces the corresponding macrocycle by intramolecular coupling of the A and C blocks. Chloroethyl vinyl ether was selected as the monomer for the central block B, because it can be readily derivatized into brushlike polymers by a grafting process. The corresponding macrocyclic brushes were decorated with polystyrene or randomly distributed polystyrene and polyisoprene branches. In a selective solvent for the polyisoprene branches, the macrocyclic brushes self-assemble into cylindrical tubes of up to 700 nanometers."

Using surface plasmon resonance, binding affinities between fibrillin and all propeptides were determined. Binding studies revealed that the N-terminal end of fibrillin-1 serves as a universal high affinity docking site for the propeptides of BMP-2, -4, -7, and -10 and GDF-5, but not GDF-8, and located the BMP/GDF binding site within the N-terminal domain in fibrillin-1. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy of molecules of BMP-7 complex bound to fibrillin-1 confirmed these findings and also showed that prodomain binding targets the growth factor to fibrillin.

Several different molecular mechanisms are known to regulate transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) 2The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; LTBP, latent TGF-β-binding protein; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; 8-Cys, 8 cysteine; GDF, growth and differentiation factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; rF, recombinant fibrillin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; pd, prodomain; gfd, growth factor dimer. 2The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; LTBP, latent TGF-β-binding protein; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; 8-Cys, 8 cysteine; GDF, growth and differentiation factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; rF, recombinant fibrillin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; pd, prodomain; gfd, growth factor dimer. signaling in the extracellular space. First, TGF-βs are secreted as latent complexes consisting of a processed growth factor dimer in association with its propeptides. The propeptide of TGF-β1, called LAP, for latency-associated peptide, confers latency either by blocking binding of the receptor to the growth factor domain or by altering the conformation of the growth factor domain such that it cannot bind to its receptors (1De Crescenzo G.

Second, covalent interactions between the propeptides and latent TGF-β-binding proteins (LTBPs) target latent TGF-β complexes to the extracellular matrix (2Miyazono K. Hellman U. Wernstedt C.

These three molecular interactions are required to properly regulate TGF-β signaling, since mutations in latency-associated peptide in LTBPs or in fibrillin-1 correlate with dysregulated TGF-β signaling in humans and mice (5Rifkin D.B.

These molecules are composed of multiple calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like modules interspersed by domains containing eight cysteines (8-Cys domains) (9Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Latency-associated peptide is disulfide-bonded to a specific 8-Cys domain in LTBP (3Saharinen J.

Handford P.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6659-6666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the human genome there are 33 8-Cys domains, and these are found only in LTBPs and fibrillins. Because of these structural similarities, we hypothesized that any member of the family of TGF-β-related growth factors may interact with LTBPs or with fibrillins. We first tested this hypothesis by recombinantly expressing full-length bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) complex and demonstrating that the BMP-7 prodomain binds to fibrillin and targets BMP-7 growth factor to fibrillin microfibrils (12Gregory K.E. Ono R.N. Charbonneau N.L. Kuo C.L. Keene D.R. Bachinger H.P. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27970-27980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Fibrillins form structures called microfibrils, which are ubiquitous in the connective tissue space and which can be defined at the ultrastructural level as small diameter (10–12 nm) fibrils that display a hollow or beaded appearance. LTBPs are associated with fibrillin microfibrils, but they are not required to form the microfibrils. The fibrillin microfibril network, including associated LTBPs, forms a physical scaffold to which TGF-β-related growth factors are targeted. Changes or disruptions in the microfibril network may affect the appropriate targeting of growth factors and may subtly or unsubtly perturb signaling activities of these growth factors. For example, heterozygous mutations in FBN1 result in poor assembly of fibrillin microfibrils by Marfan fibroblasts and disrupted patterns of fibrillin microfibrils in skin biopsies from individuals with the Marfan syndrome (13Hollister D.W. Godfrey M. Sakai L.Y. Pyeritz R.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).

However, it remains important to determine how structural alterations affect signaling activities of the growth factors targeted to the microfibril network. It is also important to identify which members of the TGF-β superfamily are targeted to tissue-specific microfibril networks and how the microfibril network coordinates the signaling activities of multiple different targeted growth factors. In this study we have extended our previous investigations to additional TGF-β-related growth factors. We first addressed whether other TGF-β family members form prodomain/growth factor complexes similar to TGF-β and BMP-7. For this purpose, we performed novel in vitro reconstitution experiments using recombinantly expressed growth factor propeptides titrated with their commercially available growth factor dimers. In addition, we tested whether various propeptides interact with fibrillins, and we identified a universal high affinity binding site present in fibrillins. We also tested whether growth factors are targeted to fibrillin microfibrils using commercially available antibodies. Based on these investigations, a general framework of how growth factors of the TGF-β superfamily are targeted to fibrillin microfibrils has emerged. Recombinant Proteins—Expression and purification of the BMP-7 complex and its separation into the BMP-7 prodomain and growth factor dimer were performed as described (12Gregory K.E. Ono R.N.

The cDNAs from SW1353 and MG63 cells were generated using the Bio-Rad iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit, after harvesting total RNA using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Coding regions for BMP and GDF prodomains were amplified from these cDNA sources by PCR with the Platinum™ Pfx DNA polymerase system using appropriate 5′- and 3′-primers designed from GenBank™ information (Table 1). The 5′ primers introduced an NdeI restriction site, whereas a BamHI site and six histidine residues in tandem followed by a termination signal were added to the downstream primers. PCR products were cloned into a NdeI/BamHI-digested pET11a vector such that each final construct contained the entire prodomain-coding sequence starting from the predicted endogenous signal peptide cleavage site and ending with the predicted furin cleavage site followed by a C-terminal His6 tag and a stop codon. Each vector construct was transformed into competent cells of E. coli DH5α, and the insert structure was verified by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. Each BMP/GDF propeptide was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified using chelating chromatography under the same conditions as described previously (22Kuo C.L. Isogai Z. Keene D.R.

Overexpressed propeptides of BMP-10 and GDF-5 showed higher solubility and were, therefore, purified out of the soluble fraction of the E. coli lysate under the same buffer conditions but with urea concentrations not higher than 2 m instead of 8 m.

To subclone the PCR products, the primers were designed to introduce an additional NheI restriction site at the 5′ end and either a NotI or XhoI restriction site at the 3′ end. In addition, the sequences for six histidine residues were introduced into the PCR product at the 3′ end (with the exception of rF63, where the 6×histidine tag sequence was placed at the 5′ end) to facilitate purification of the recombinant peptide using chelating chromatography. Ligation of the PCR products into the episomal expression vectors pCEP4/2III4 or AC7/pCEP-Pu (21Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R.

Human embryonic kidney cells, 293/EBNA, were transfected and selected with hygromycin B or puromycin (Sigma). These methodologies and protein purification methods have been described in more detail (20Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Poschl E. Bachinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Expression vector rF86 was constructed from human FBN2 cDNA clones obtained by screening λgt11 unamplified placenta library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with FBN1-specific PCR products, as described previously (9Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). One clone, UPΦ22-3, was used to amplify sequences for rF86 by PCR using appropriate primers (Table 2). For rF87, rF92, and rF93, the rF23 expression construct (14Reinhardt D.P. Sasaki T. Dzamba B.J.

To generate rF85, two cDNA fragments, rF85A and rF85B, were generated by PCR using sequence specific primers and a fibrillin-1 full-length clone, HFBN29 (9Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), as a template. PCR fragment rF85A was digested with NheI/SpnI, rF85B with KpnI/NotI, and a full-length cDNA clone rF100 with KpnI/SpnI. All three obtained fragments were ligated into a pCEP-SP vector that had been predigested with NheI/NotI. Purified proteins from these newly constructed fibrillin recombinant constructs are shown in Fig. 1B. The expression construct for rF90 was generated as described earlier for rF11 (14Reinhardt D.P.

The amplified fragment was digested with NheI/XhoI and ligated into a pCEP-Pu vector. The resulting construct was transfected into 293/EBNA cells for protein expression. Rotary Shadowing and Electron Microscopy—Purified BMP-7 complex (100 μg/ml) was dialyzed together with rF90 (160, 340, and 680 μg/ml) in 0.2 m NH4HCO3 with or without 2 mm CaCl2. These amounts were equivalent to molar ratios from 1:1 to 1:4 of BMP-7 complex to rF90. The presence of CaCl2 did not result in any noticeable difference. Each sample was diluted to 70% glycerol, then sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica and rotary-shadowed with Pt-C using a Balzers BAE 250 vacuum evaporator. Photomicrographs were taken using a Philips EM410 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Velocity Sedimentation—Recombinant propeptides and growth factor dimers were mixed at molar ratios mentioned under “Results” and dialyzed against TBS or TBS containing 1 m urea. Because the GDF-8 and GDF-5 prodomain (pd) were more soluble than the BMP pd, experiments with GDF pd were conducted in TBS without urea. Aliquots (200 μl) were then pipetted onto the top of a 5–20% (w/v) sucrose gradient (3.6 ml total volume), buffered with TBS, and formed in Polyallomer tubes (11×3×60 mm; Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Ultracentrifugation experiments were performed for 22 h 15 min at 42,000 rpm (ω2t: 1.55 · 1012) at 4 °C in a Beckman L8-M ultracentrifuge using a Beckman SW 60Ti rotor. After a small hole was pricked with a pin in the bottom of the tubes, 8-drop fractions were collected. Fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE containing 12.5% (w/v) acrylamide, and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Protein loading was checked by Ponceau stain. Nitrocellulose membranes were developed with either SuperSignal™ (Pierce) or the Opti 4-CN™ substrate kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some cases membranes were redeveloped after stripping with Restore Western blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce) and additional first and secondary antibody incubations. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding analyses were performed using a BIAcoreX (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Propeptides of BMP-2, -4, -7, and -10 and GDF-5 and -8 (500 response units of each molecule) were covalently coupled to CM5 sensor chips (research grade) using the amine coupling kit following the manufacturer's instructions (BIAcore AB). Binding responses due to analyte interaction with the surface coupled ligand were normalized by subtraction of background binding to control flow cells. Binding assays were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) P20 surfactant (HBS-EP buffer, BIAcore AB). Fibrillin peptides were diluted in HBS-EP buffer and then injected at several concentrations and different flow rates over immobilized BMP propeptides. For competition assays, rF23 was preincubated at a constant concentration of 20 nm with the competitor BMP propeptide at concentrations of 400-5 nm before injection. To account for variations of the rF23 signal due to buffer changes caused by the addition of different amounts of competitor, we generated for each competition sensorgram a buffer-matched control without competitor, and the maximum response was set in each case as the 100% reference signal. The surface was regenerated with a pulse of 10 mm glycine, pH 1.7. Kinetic constants were calculated by nonlinear fitting (1:1 interaction model with mass transfer) to the association and dissociation curves according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIAevaluation 3.0 software). Apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD values) were then calculated as the ratio of kd/ka. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Wild type mouse tissues were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. C57Bl/6 pups were sacrificed at P1-P5, and limbs were sectioned and stained according to routine protocols (18Charbonneau N.L. Dzamba B.J. Ono R.N. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. J.

BMP-4 (mAb 751) and BMP-7 (mAb 3541) antibodies from R&D were diluted 1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline; pAb 9543 and 0868 were diluted 1:200. For coimmunolocalization, P3 limbs were sectioned and stained simultaneously with BMP-4 mAb and fibrillin-1 or fibrillin-2 pAb, detected with anti-mouse Alexa 488 and anti-rabbit Alex 568 (Invitrogen), and coverslipped with Prolong Gold antifade mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen).

Using a fluorescent protein fusion, SeqA-YFP, we have visualized this process in real time and in single cells of Escherichia coli . We found that the F pilus mediates DNA transfer at considerable cell-to-cell distances. Integration of transferred DNA by recombination occurred in up to 96% of recipients; in the remaining cells, the transferred DNA was fully degraded by the RecBCD helicase/nuclease. The acquired integrated DNA was tracked through successive replication rounds and was found to occasionally split and segregate with different chromosomes, leading to the inheritance of different gene clusters within the cell lineage. The incidence of DNA splitting corresponds to about one crossover per cell generation."
https://openalex.org/W2068420371,"The diplomonad parasite Giardia intestinalis contains two functionally equivalent nuclei that are inherited independently during mitosis. Although presumed to be asexual, Giardia has low levels of allelic heterozygosity, indicating that the two nuclear genomes may exchange genetic material. Fluorescence in situ hybridization performed with probes to an episomal plasmid suggests that plasmids are transferred between nuclei in the cyst, and transmission electron micrographs demonstrate fusion between cyst nuclei. Green fluorescent protein fusions of giardial homologs of meiosis-specific genes localized to the nuclei of cysts, but not the vegetative trophozoite. These data suggest that the fusion of nuclei, or karyogamy, and subsequently somatic homologous recombination facilitated by the meiosis gene homologs, occur in the giardial cyst."
https://openalex.org/W2086557921,"When grown as three-dimensional structures, tumor cells can acquire an additional multicellular resistance to apoptosis that may mimic the chemoresistance found in solid tumors. We developed a multicellular spheroid model of malignant mesothelioma to investigate molecular mechanisms of acquired apoptotic resistance. We found that mesothelioma cell lines, when grown as multicellular spheroids, acquired resistance to a variety of apoptotic stimuli, including combinations of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), ribotoxic stressors, histone deacetylase, and proteasome inhibitors, that were highly effective against mesothelioma cells when grown as monolayers. Inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, particularly rapamycin, blocked much of the acquired resistance of the spheroids, suggesting a key role for mTOR. Knockdown by small interference RNA of S6K, a major downstream target of mTOR, reproduced the effect of rapamycin, thereby confirming the role of mTOR and of S6K in the acquired resistance of threedimensional spheroids. Rapamycin or S6K knockdown increased TRAIL-induced caspase-8 cleavage in spheroids, suggesting initially that mTOR inhibited apoptosis by actions at the death receptor pathway; however, isolation of the apoptotic pathways by means of Bid knockdown ablated this effect showing that mTOR actually controls a step distal to Bid, probably at the level of the mitochondria. In sum, mTOR and S6K contribute to the apoptotic resistance of mesothelioma cells in three-dimensional, not in two-dimensional, cultures. The three-dimensional model may reflect a more clinically relevant <i>in vitro</i> setting in which mTOR exhibits anti-apoptotic properties."
https://openalex.org/W2017263653,"Iron/sulfur (Fe/S) proteins are central to the functioning of cells in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here, we show that the yhgI gene, which we renamed nfuA, encodes a two-domain protein that is required for Fe/S biogenesis in Escherichia coli. The N-terminal domain resembles the so-called Fe/S A-type scaffold but, curiously, has lost the functionally important Cys residues. The C-terminal domain shares sequence identity with Nfu proteins. Mössbauer and UV-visible spectroscopic analyses revealed that, upon reconstitution, NfuA binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Moreover, NfuA can transfer this cluster to apo-aconitase. Mutagenesis studies indicated that the N- and C-terminal domains are important for NfuA function in vivo. Similarly, the functional importance of Cys residues present in the Nfu-like domain was demonstrated in vivo by introducing Cys→Ser mutations. In vivo investigations revealed that the nfuA gene is important for E. coli to sustain oxidative stress and iron starvation. Also, combining nfuA with either isc or suf mutations led to additive phenotypic deficiencies, indicating that NfuA is a bona fide new player in Isc- and Suf-dependent Fe/S biogenesis pathways. Taken together, these data demonstrate that NfuA intervenes in the maturation of apoproteins in E. coli, allowing them to acquire Fe/S clusters. By taking into account results from numerous previous transcriptomic studies that had suggested a link between NfuA and protein misfolding, we discuss the possibility that NfuA could act as a scaffold/chaperone for damaged Fe/S proteins.

Deciphering how Fe/S clusters are formed and inserted into apoproteins became a field of wide interest in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Seminal studies on the biosynthesis of the iron molybdenum cofactor contained in the Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase allowed Dean and co-workers to discover the Nif system (1Jacobson M.R.

It involves ∼20 proteins among which three, NifS, NifU, and possibly IscANif, are dedicated to biogenesis of the nitrogenase Fe/S cluster (3Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev.

Studies in Escherichia coli and a few other bacteria, including Synechococcus and Erwinia, led to the discovery of two additional systems, referred to as Suf and Isc, which allow Fe/S biogenesis and insertion in most, if not all, cellular Fe/S proteins (5Barras F.

All of the Fe/S biogenesis systems mentioned above contain a cysteine desulfurase and at least one so-called scaffold protein. Cysteine desulfurases degrade l-cysteine to produce l-alanine and inorganic sulfur that eventually becomes part of a Fe/S cluster (9Loiseau L. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Lascoux D. Forest E.

The occurrence of a scaffold would also fit with the prediction that in vivo Fe/S clusters would not form spontaneously from free iron and sulfide as they could do in vitro. A scaffold was therefore defined as a protein that binds transiently Fe/S clusters, presumably using Cys residues as ligands, and transfers them to apotargets. The A. vinelandii NifU protein met with all these criteria and was concluded to be a scaffold (3Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev.

Parallel investigations on Fe/S biogenesis allowed the discovery of another type of scaffold protein referred to as the A-type. Members of this family include IscA within the Isc system, SufA within the Suf system, and IscANif within the Nif system (3Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev.

Structures of both the holoand apoforms of IscA were obtained, and potential cysteine ligands were determined (26Cupp-Vickery J.R. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Mol.

The yhgI gene is predicted to encode a protein-exhibiting sequence similarity with Nfu. Whether this is actually a Nfu-like protein was an important issue to investigate, because to date, E. coli is among the few organisms lacking such an activity. Moreover, in recent years, the yhgI gene has actually been proposed to be involved in a wide spectrum of different biological processes, ranging from gluconate metabolism (29Porco A. Alonso G. Isturiz T. J. Basic Microbiol. 1998; 38: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to nutritional competence and stress responses (30Palchevskiy V. Finkel S.E. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3902-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), rendering its actual role in E. coli uncertain. In this study, we provide evidence that YhgI, which we renamed NfuA, is involved in Fe/S biogenesis, directly intervening in maturing apoprotein, and is required for E. coli to resist oxidative stress and iron starvation. Strains and Growth Conditions—E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB)-rich medium at 37 °C. Strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) were added when necessary. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. or Fluka unless otherwise stated. Plasmid Construction—The E. coli nfuA gene was amplified by PCR, with Y1 and Y2 primers, and ligated into the expression plasmid pET22b+ at the NdeI/XhoI sites, yielding the pETnfuA plasmid. By using Y5 and Y6 primers, the nfuA gene was ligated into the low copy vector pUC18 at the BamHI and HindIII sites, yielding the pUCnfuA plasmid. The pUCnfuA-Nt plasmid, allowing expression of the N-terminal domain of NfuA, was obtained by generating a PCR fragment with Y5 and NtY7 primers and ligating it between the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pUC18 plasmid. The pUCnfuA-Ct plasmid, allowing expression of the C-terminal domain of NfuA, was obtained by a similar strategy using CtY8 and Y6 primers. The A. vinelandii nfuA gene was amplified by PCR from the plasmid vector pDB1622 (D. Dean laboratory) by using the Nfu1 and Nfu2 primer pair. The resulting PCR fragment was ligated into the pUC18 vector, at the BamHI and HindIII sites, generating the pUCnfu plasmid. The substituted versions of NfuA were obtained by a two-step PCR mutagenesis method. The mutagenic primer pairs were designed (i) to be completely complementary to each other and (ii) to span the site of the substitution. To construct the NfuAC39S variant, two separate PCR reactions were performed with as template the pETnfuA plasmid and by using either the Y5/YC1mut2 pair or the YC1mut1/Y6 pair as primers. The full-length encoding sequence of the NfuAC39S variant was obtained in a second PCR reaction by combining the two previous PCR products and the Y5/Y6 primer pair. The final PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into the pUC18 vector. The same procedure was followed to substitute each cysteine of NfuA. To construct plasmids allowing production of His-tagged versions of the NfuA cysteine variants, the same strategy was used except that the Y5/Y6 primer pair was replaced by the Y1/Y2 primer pair, and the final PCR product was ligated into the pET22b+ vector. All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. DNA manipulations were performed in E. coli MG1655 using established standard protocols or under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. All the primers used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S2. Protein Purification—NfuA was obtained as follows. E. coli BL21(DE3)/pETnfuA was grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced for 4 h by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) 3The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; AcnA, aconitase; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR. to an exponentially growing culture. The bacterial pellet (10 g/6 liters) was resuspended in buffer A (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl) and sonicated before ultracentrifugation (90 min, 45,000 rpm, 4 °C). The supernatant was treated with DNase I and 10 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C for 45 min, and after centrifugation (30 min, 15,000 rpm, 4 °C), 800 mg of soluble proteins were loaded onto a 10-ml Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A. The NfuA protein was eluted with buffer A containing 0.2 m imidazole. The NfuA-containing fractions were mixed with ammonium sulfate (60% saturation) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (30 min, 15,000 rpm), the pellet was resuspended in buffer A and desalted onto a Nap-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). This protocol allowed for the purification of ∼70 mg of NfuA from 800 mg of bacterial extracts. A similar procedure was used to purify NfuA variants. Aconitase (AcnA) was obtained from IPTG-induced cultures of JRG4004 strain according to a slightly modified version of the procedure reported by Jordan et al. (31Jordan P.A. Tang Y. Bradbury A.J. Thomson A.J. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 739-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the ammonium sulfate precipitation step, AcnA-enriched fractions were loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1.7 m (NH4)2SO4). AcnA was eluted with a linear gradient of 1.7 to 0 m (NH4)2SO4. Finally, after chromatography on a Superdex-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer C (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm DTT), 30 mg of AcnA protein was recovered (95% pure). Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard, which in the case of NfuA overestimates the concentration by a factor of 1.2, as determined by the quantitative amino acid analysis of purified NfuA. Iron and Sulfide Binding to NfuA—The following procedure was carried out anaerobically in the glove box at 18 °C. The purified NfuA was obtained in its apoprotein form. To reconstitute the protein, 0.7 mm apo-NfuA was mixed with 10 μm IscS and 8 mml-cysteine (Aldrich) in buffer A and 3 mm 57FeCl3 previously reduced with 2 m DTT was then added to the solution leading to a 5 mm DTT final concentration. After 4 h of incubation, the protein was passed through a Nap-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove unspecifically bound iron and then concentrated on a Microcon concentrator (Amicon). Spectroscopic Analyses—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with an Uvikon XL spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments). Zero field 57Fe-Mössbauer spectra were recorded using a 400-μl cuvette with a spectrometer operating in constant acceleration mode using an Oxford cryostat that allowed temperatures from 1.5 to 300 K and a 57Co source in rhodium. Isomer shifts are reported relative to iron foil at room temperature. Fe/S Cluster Transfer from NfuA to Apo-aconitase—All the following procedures were performed anaerobically in the glove box at 18 °C. Aconitase A, isolated in its apoform, was incubated in buffer D (buffer A containing 5 mm DTT) with a 3.5-fold molar excess of the reconstituted NfuA for 2 h. DTT was removed from the solution on a Nap-10 column equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were then separated on a Ni-NTA affinity column (1 ml) equilibrated with buffer A. The aconitase was recovered in the flow-through fraction, as it did not contain a polyhistidine tag. NfuA was eluted with buffer A containing 0.2 m imidazole. The fractions containing pure aconitase, as judged from SDS-PAGE analysis, were concentrated in a Microcon device before analysis by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and for metal content. Construction of nfuA Mutant Strains—Deletion of the nfuA gene was performed by the method described by Datsenko and Wanner (32Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11299) Google Scholar), using the strain BW25113, pKD4, and the YmutUp and YmutDown primers. The chromosomal deletion of the nfuA gene was confirmed by PCR analysis using primers complementary to the cassette and to regions flanking nfuA (P1inv, P2, bioH, and gntTinv primers). P1 transduction was used to move the ΔnfuA::kan mutation into MG1655 to create the strain SA001. The kanamycin cassette was then eliminated by site-specific recombination using the Flp plasmid pCP20 (33Cherepanov P.P. Wackernagel W. Gene. 1995; 158: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). The resulting ΔnfuA strain was named SA002. P1 transduction was also used to introduce the ΔnfuA::kan mutation into various mutant backgrounds (supplemental Table S1). 2,2′-Dipyridyl and Paraquat Sensitivity—Overnight cultures were diluted in sterile water and directly spotted onto LB plates containing either 2,2′-dipyridyl (200-250 μm) or paraquat (100 μm). The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C before growth was scored. RNA Extraction—Total RNA was isolated from cell culture according to the following protocol. Cells in early exponential growth were treated for 20 min with 2,2′-dipyridyl (250 μm) or paraquat (250 μm). An aliquot of the bacterial cultures was centrifuged (5000 × g for 10 min) to pellet the cells. RNA was isolated by extraction, using the SV total RNA Isolation System (Promega). RNA samples were further treated with 10 units of RNase-free DNase (Roche Applied Science) in a 100-μl volume for 20 min, and then extracted using phenol/chloroform. Then, total RNA was precipitated using a standard ethanol precipitation. The RNA was resuspended in 50 μl of RNase-free water. The RNA concentration and integrity were assessed by optical density and by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel with Tris acetate-EDTA buffer. PCR was performed to assess DNA contamination. If necessary, DNase treatment was repeated to ensure that no detectable chromosomal DNA was in the RNA preparation. Quantitative Real-time PCR—The nfuA mRNA level was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Y1 and YRT2 primers were tested prior to qRT-PCR analysis to confirm that they resulted in a single amplicon of the proper size when genomic DNA was used as template. Total RNA (20 ng) was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II with 100 ng of random primers according to the manufacturer's specifications (Invitrogen). A series of cDNA dilutions, along with 150 nm Y1 and YRT2 primers, was then subjected to qRT-PCR using an Eppendorf Mastercycler® ep realplex and SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™, according to the manufacturer's specifications (TaKaRa). Data analysis and normalization were performed with software supplied with the Mastercycler. Identification of NfuA, a Unique Nfu-like Protein—The yhgI gene was identified by searching the E. coli chromosome for genes encoding putative Nfu-like proteins. BLAST analysis showed that the YhgI-predicted protein has two domains (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain shares 24-28% identity with the A-type Fe/S proteins of E. coli (i.e. IscA, SufA, and ErpA). Surprisingly, however, it does not possess the three conserved cysteine residues thought to act as Fe/S cluster ligands in A-type scaffolds proteins. The C-terminal domain of YhgI exhibits 21% identity with the Nfu domain of NifU from A. vinelandii and contains the conserved CXXC motif. This as yet undescribed association between an A-type and a Nfu-type scaffold domain prompted us to further investigate the role of YhgI. Evidence presented below support the conclusion that YhgI is indeed involved in Fe/S biogenesis. Accordingly, the gene will be referred to as nfuA. NfuA Binds a [4Fe-4S] Cluster—Data from sequence analysis showed that NfuA has similarity to Fe/S-binding proteins. Therefore, we tested whether NfuA binds a Fe/S cluster. To characterize NfuA, large amounts of soluble C-terminal His-tagged NfuA protein were purified from E. coli under aerobic conditions. The molecular mass of the purified protein was ∼25 kDa, as estimated from SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (data not shown). This is in agreement with the theoretical mass of 22,062 Da deduced from the DNA sequence. The oligomerization state of NfuA was determined by gel filtration on Superdex 75. NfuA eluted in a major peak corresponding to a dimer; a very small peak corresponding to aggregated forms of larger size could also be observed (data not shown). As isolated, the NfuA protein was colorless and did not bind detectable iron and sulfide. Accordingly, the corresponding UV-visible spectrum displays no absorption band in addition to the tyrosine and tryptophan residue absorption at 280 nm. Thus, the ability of NfuA to bind a Fe/S cluster was tested after incubation under anaerobic conditions with 4-8 molar equivalents of both ferric iron and sulfide in the presence of DTT. Such a treatment yielded a protein that contained a maximum amount of 4.2 iron and 2 sulfur atoms per polypeptide chain. The UV-visible spectrum of the reconstituted NfuA (holo-NfuA) displayed an absorption band at 420 nm and a shoulder at 320 nm, indicating the presence of a Fe/S cluster (supplemental Fig. S1). Mössbauer spectroscopy was used to characterize the nature of the iron sites present in holo-NfuA. The reconstituted protein was prepared with 57FeCl3/DTT, and the sulfide was provided by the IscS-dependent cysteine desulfurization reaction. The Mössbauer spectrum recorded at 78 K is shown in Fig. 2. The spectrum mainly consists of one relatively broad and asymmetric central doublet and a much weaker one with the high energy peak at ∼+2.8 mms-1. The spectrum was simulated assuming three doublets, labeled A, B, and C. Doublet A is characterized by δ = 0.45(2) mms-1 and ΔEQ = 1.13(3) mms-1. Doublet A was retained in a spectrum recorded at 4.2 K in a large velocity range (Fig. 2). This observation combined with the characteristic Mössbauer parameters of doublet A strongly suggest that the corresponding species is a S = 0 [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. By taking into account the spectra at the two temperatures, we estimate that 60-70% of total iron corresponds to such [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters in the present sample. For doublet B, the parameters are δ = 0.45(2) mms-1 and ΔEQ = 0.70(3) mms-1. At 4.2 K, the doublet B is replaced by a broad background. This behavior indicates that doublet B belongs to a paramagnetic species of unknown origin at present. Doublet C is characterized by δ = 1.4(2) mms-1 and ΔEQ = 2.7(2) mms-1, and these parameters are consistent with a high spin ferrous species in an octahedral environment comprising N/O donors. It accounts for roughly 6% of total iron and is attributed to impurities. All these data suggest that NfuA is able to bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster, presumably at the interface of two monomers. This cluster is unstable both in the presence of oxygen and upon anaerobic reduction (data not shown). No EPR signals could be detected under oxidative conditions. However, anaerobic"
https://openalex.org/W2070465458,"The relationship between natural variations in coral species diversity, reef development, and ecosystem function on coral reefs is poorly understood. Recent coral diversity varies 10-fold among geographic regions, but rates of reef growth are broadly similar, suggesting that diversity is unimportant for reef development. Differences in diversity may reflect regional differences in long-term biotic history in addition to environmental conditions. Using a combination of new and published fossil and stratigraphic data, we compared changes in coral diversity and reef development within the tropical western Atlantic over the past 28 million years. Reef development was unrelated to coral diversity, and the largest reef tracts formed after extinction had reduced diversity by 50%. High diversity is thus not essential for the growth and persistence of coral reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2035839314,"Iron-sulfur clusters ([Fe-S] clusters) are assembled on molecular scaffolds and subsequently used for maturation of proteins that require [Fe-S] clusters for their functions. Previous studies have shown that Azotobacter vinelandii produces at least two [Fe-S] cluster assembly scaffolds: NifU, required for the maturation of nitrogenase, and IscU, required for the general maturation of other [Fe-S] proteins. A. vinelandii also encodes a protein designated NfuA, which shares amino acid sequence similarity with the C-terminal region of NifU. The activity of aconitase, a [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing enzyme, is markedly diminished in a strain containing an inactivated nfuA gene. This inactivation also results in a null-growth phenotype when the strain is cultivated under elevated oxygen concentrations. NifU has a limited ability to serve the function of NfuA, as its expression at high levels corrects the defect of the nfuA-disrupted strain. Spectroscopic and analytical studies indicate that one [4Fe-4S] cluster can be assembled in vitro within a dimeric form of NfuA. The resultant [4Fe-4S] cluster-loaded form of NfuA is competent for rapid in vitro activation of apo-aconitase. Based on these results a model is proposed where NfuA could represent a class of intermediate [Fe-S] cluster carriers involved in [Fe-S] protein maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2042232981,"Depth perception in humans and other animals can be based on binocular vision, in which the brain compares images from each eye. We can also judge depth with one eye, but how the brain processes the many different cues available for monocular perception of depth is not known. A possible explanation for one cue has now been found. The neurons in the middle temporal area of the brain, as well as representing retinal motion, can combine visual information and physical movement to extract depth information from motion parallax, a powerful depth cue that we experience when viewing the scenery from the window of a moving train — objects on the horizon move slowly while the scene close to the train flashes by. It is shown that in addition to the well-documented representation of retinal motion, primate area middle temporal area neurons are sensitive to the relative depth of stimuli defined by motion parallax. Motion parallax is a powerful depth cue that arises when the observer is moving due to near and far objects moving across the retina at different speeds. Perception of depth is a fundamental challenge for the visual system, particularly for observers moving through their environment. The brain makes use of multiple visual cues to reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of a scene. One potent cue, motion parallax, frequently arises during translation of the observer because the images of objects at different distances move across the retina with different velocities. Human psychophysical studies have demonstrated that motion parallax can be a powerful depth cue1,2,3,4,5, and motion parallax seems to be heavily exploited by animal species that lack highly developed binocular vision6,7,8. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie this capacity. Here we show, by using a virtual-reality system to translate macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) while they viewed motion parallax displays that simulated objects at different depths, that many neurons in the middle temporal area (area MT) signal the sign of depth (near versus far) from motion parallax in the absence of other depth cues. To achieve this, neurons must combine visual motion with extra-retinal (non-visual) signals related to the animal’s movement. Our findings suggest a new neural substrate for depth perception and demonstrate a robust interaction of visual and non-visual cues in area MT. Combined with previous studies that implicate area MT in depth perception based on binocular disparities9,10,11,12, our results suggest that area MT contains a more general representation of three-dimensional space that makes use of multiple cues."

https://openalex.org/W1990458209,"Bax is activated and translocated onto mitochondria to mediate cytochrome c release and apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms of Bax activation during apoptosis remain a subject of debate. We addressed the question of whether reactive oxygen species could directly activate Bax for its subsequent translocation and apoptosis. Using the SW480 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line stably expressing Bax fused to GFP, we showed that H2O2 induces Bax conformational change, mitochondrial translocation, and subsequent oligomerization at mitochondria. We found that H2O2-induced Bax activation is dependent on the conserved cysteine residue 62 of Bax. Mutation of cysteine 62, but not cysteine 126, to serine or alanine abolished its activation by H2O2 but not other death stimuli, both in SW480 and Bax-deficient HCT116 cells, whereas wild type Bax sensitizes these cells to apoptosis. Cysteines of Bax could chemically react with H2O2. Mutation of Bax BH3 domain in the presence of cysteine 62 also abolished Bax proapoptotic activity. We conclude that reactive oxygen species could be a direct signal for Bax activation by reacting with cysteine residues. Our results identify a critical role of cysteine 62 in oxidative stress-induced Bax activation and subsequent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2005046011,"The Escherichia coli MsbA protein is a 65-kDa member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily. It is thought to function as an ATP-dependent lipid translocase that transports lipid A from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. MsbA with high ATPase activity was isolated and found to be homodimeric in detergent solution. The protein ATPase activity was inhibited by vanadate and showed variable patterns of stimulation and inhibition by lipid A and other compounds. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protein was characterized, and dynamic quenching using acrylamide showed that a conformational change took place on binding of lipid A. Fluorescence quenching was used to characterize the interactions of MsbA with nucleotides and various putative substrates, including lipids, lipid-like compounds, and drugs. MsbA had an apparent binding affinity for ATP of ∼2 mm and also bound nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs and fluorescent ATP derivatives. The putative substrate lipid A interacted with the protein with an affinity of 6.4 μm. Drugs that are known to be substrates for ABC multidrug transporters also interacted with MsbA with affinities in the range 0.25–50 μm.

The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria possesses a unique asymmetric structure. The inner leaflet is composed primarily of glycerophospholipids, although with a higher proportion of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) 3The abbreviations used are: PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; AMP-PCP, adenylylmethylenediphosphonate; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate; DM, dodecyl maltoside; DTE, dithioerythritol; FRET, Forster resonance energy transfer; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; H33342, Hoechst 33342; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MDR, multidrug resistance; NATA, N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide; NB, nucleotide binding; Pgp, P-glycoprotein; TM, transmembrane; TNP, 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl); Vi, vanadate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; AMP-PCP, adenylylmethylenediphosphonate; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate; DM, dodecyl maltoside; DTE, dithioerythritol; FRET, Forster resonance energy transfer; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; H33342, Hoechst 33342; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MDR, multidrug resistance; NATA, N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide; NB, nucleotide binding; Pgp, P-glycoprotein; TM, transmembrane; TNP, 2′(3′)-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl); Vi, vanadate; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. and saturated acyl chains than the cytoplasmic membrane (reviewed in Ref. 1Huijbregts R.P. de Kroon A.I. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The outer leaflet of the outer membrane is composed mainly of lipid A (Fig. 1), the hexa-acylated hydrophobic core lipid of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (reviewed in Ref. 2Raetz C.R. Reynolds C.M. Trent M.S. Bishop R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 295-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Our understanding of how these lipids traffic to the outer membrane, and how lipid asymmetry is maintained, is limited. One important component of this lipid trafficking system appears to be MsbA (Fig. 1), an essential 64.5-kDa protein found in the cytoplasmic membrane. MsbA is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of proteins, and is proposed to translocate the LPS precursor lipid A (and possibly also phospholipids) from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. MsbA-mediated translocation is thought to be the first step in the movement of lipid A from its site of synthesis on the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane to its final location in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. MsbA is a 582-residue integral protein with six putative transmembrane (TM) helices and one ABC-type nucleotide-binding (NB) domain at its C-terminal end (Fig. 1). It is presumed to function as a dimer. The sequence of MsbA is 30% identical and 46% similar to that of the N-terminal half of P-glycoprotein (Pgp; ABCB1; MDR1) (3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), a mammalian efflux pump implicated in multidrug resistance to anti-cancer agents (reviewed in Ref. 4Sharom F.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 979-992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MsbA is a further 51% identical and 66% similar to Pgp in the NB regions (3Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and it is one of the prokaryotic proteins most homologous to a mammalian ABC protein. The x-ray crystal structures of MsbA from three bacterial species in different conformations were recently reported (5Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), after the original MsbA structures were withdrawn due to the discovery of a flaw in the software used to solve them (6Chang G. Roth C.B. Reyes C.L. Pornillos O. Chen Y.J. Chen A.P. Science. 2006; 314: 1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A new AMP-PNP-bound structure of MsbA was solved to 3.7 Å, and showed a series of interacting helices that span the bilayer and extend from the membrane into the cytosol, where they are coupled to two interdigitated NB domains (5Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The overall shape and domain organization of MsbA resemble that of the 3.0 Å structure of the putative bacterial multidrug transporter Sav1866 (7Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) and the 8 Å cryo-EM structure of Pgp (8Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Modok S. Higgins C.F. Ford R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2857-2862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of MsbA reconstituted into Escherichia coli lipids could be stimulated 4–5-fold in the presence of 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid-lipid A (9Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), demonstrating that MsbA is a lipid-activated ATPase. Reuter et al. (10Reuter G. Janvilisri T. Venter H. Shahi S. Balakrishnan L. Van Veen H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35193-35198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) reported that MsbA and LmrA (a bacterial homolog of Pgp) had similar substrate specificities. MsbA overexpression in E. coli conferred resistance to ethidium bromide, by apparent energy-dependent transport of the molecule from intact cells. The protein could be photolabeled by the LmrA/Pgp photoactive substrate [3H]azidopine, and like LmrA and Pgp, its ATPase activity in membrane vesicles was stimulated by daunorubicin, vinblastine, and Hoechst H33342 (H33342). Finally, ATP-dependent transport of H33342 could be detected in proteoliposomes containing MsbA. A more recent study reported that transport of ethidium bromide and H33342 by MsbA overexpressed in Lactococcus lactis was inhibited by lipid A (11Woebking B. Reuter G. Shilling R.A. Velamakanni S. Shahi S. Venter H. Balakrishnan L. Van Veen H.W. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6363-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest a physiological role for MsbA in the translocation of lipid A, and possibly phospholipids, from the inner to the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. Mutations in MsbA result in accumulation of both lipid A derivatives and phospholipids in the inner membrane of E. coli (12Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In E. coli MsbA missense mutants at the nonpermissive temperature, both PE and lipid A were accessible to chemical and enzymatic modification from the cytoplasmic rather than the periplasmic face (13Doerrler W.T. Gibbons H.S. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45102-45109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), consistent with a model of MsbA-mediated translocation between membrane leaflets, rather than ejection from the bilayer. Several ABC proteins translocate or “flip” phospholipids from the inner to the outer leaflet of the membrane, suggesting that MsbA may function in the same way. For example, LmrA, Pgp, and MRP1 can mediate flip-flop of fluorescently labeled lipids in a reconstituted system (14Margolles A. Putman M. Van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16298-16306Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 15Romsicki Y. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6937-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Eckford P.D.

We report here the purification of MsbA with very high levels of ATPase activity (0.9–1.0 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed per min/mg of protein) in both detergent solution (where it appears to exist as a dimer) and reconstituted proteoliposomes. MsbA ATPase activity was modulated by lipid A, lipid-like compounds, and other molecules known to be substrates for ABC multidrug transporters. This work characterizes the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of purified functional MsbA for the first time and examines possible conformational changes arising from nucleotide and substrate binding. Fluorescence quenching studies are used to demonstrate the interaction of nucleotides, lipids, and related molecules with the protein and quantitate their binding affinity. Such studies are a necessary first step to understanding the transport cycle and catalytic mechanism of this protein. Materials—N-Dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM) was obtained through Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin was purchased from Qiagen (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Bio-Beads SM-2 adsorbent was purchased from Bio-Rad. ADP, ATP, AMP-PCP, AMP-PNP, lipid A, RaLPS, ReLPS, colchicine, daunorubicin, dithioerythritol (DTE), sodium orthovanadate, verapamil, vinblastine and N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide (NATA), were purchased from Sigma. E. coli lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). H33342, TNP-ATP, and TNP-ADP were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Roche Diagnostics generously provided ilmofosine (1-S-hexadecylthio-2-methoxy-methyl-2-deoxy-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine). D-20133 (octadecyl-(2-(N-methyl-piperidino)-ethyl)-phosphate) and D-21266 (octadecyl-(N,N-dimethyl-piperidino-4-yl)-phosphate) were gifts from ASTA Medica (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Edelfosine (1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-racglycero-3-phosphocholine) was obtained from Calbiochem. Lipid A, the rough chemotype RaLPS, and the smooth chemotype ReLPS were prepared as stock solutions in the appropriate buffer. Other drugs were prepared as stock solutions in DMSO. E. coli lipid stocks were prepared in 4:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol and stored at –20 °C. MsbA Expression and Purification—A plasmid containing wild-type, N-terminally His6-tagged E. coli MsbA was provided by Dr. Candice Klug of the Medical College of Wisconsin (18Buchaklian A.H. Funk A.L. Klug C.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8600-8606Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The protein was overexpressed in E. coli, essentially as described previously (18Buchaklian A.H. Funk A.L. Klug C.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8600-8606Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmid was transformed into BL21 DE3 cells for expression, and the cells were grown in 1-liter flasks in the presence of 30 μg/ml kanamycin A at 37 °C. Cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h before harvesting. Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared by cell lysis using a French press at a pressure of 10,000 p.s.i., followed by both low and high speed centrifugation of the cell lysis mixture. The vesicles were lysed with 1% (w/v) DM, and MsbA was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) DM. Protein was assayed by the method of Peterson (19Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7067) Google Scholar) using a bovine serum albumin standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), using a 10% acrylamide gel with 50 μg of membrane protein or 10 μg of purified MsbA in 0.1% (w/v) DM, followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. An unstained gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with mouse anti-His6 antibody (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Samples were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of the Oligomeric State of MsbA by Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration sizing analysis was carried out on a 10 × 300 mm Superose 610/300 GL column (Amersham Biosciences) using an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system. After column equilibration with 20 mm HEPES buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% (w/v) DM, pH 7.5, a 100-μl sample (1.7 mg/ml) of purified MsbA or protein standard (aldolase, 158 kDa; transferrin, 81 kDa; or ovalbumin, 45 kDa) was applied to the column. Proteins were eluted at 0.5 ml/min, and elution was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The molecular weight of MsbA was interpolated by comparison of its elution volume to those of the protein standards. Reconstitution of MsbA into Proteoliposomes—MsbA was reconstituted into proteoliposomes of E. coli lipids by mixing 5 mg of dried lipid with 500 μl of 1% (w/v) DM and 1 ml of purified MsbA at the desired concentration in reconstitution buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTE, pH 7.5). After solubilization, three additions were made of 200 mg each of Bio-Beads SM-2 adsorbent, with stirring for 3 h on ice. The sample was removed from the Bio-Beads using a fine needle and centrifuged for 20 min at 37,000 × g, and the proteoliposome pellet was resuspended in fresh buffer. Proteoliposome size measurements were carried out using a Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments, Southborough, MA). ATPase Activity Measurements—ATPase activity associated with inside-out membrane vesicles, purified MsbA in DM, and MsbA reconstituted into proteoliposomes was determined by the method of Chifflet et al. (21Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) as described previously (22Eckford P.D. Sharom F.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 1022-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but using 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTE, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, as the ATPase buffer and a final concentration of 5 mm ATP. Measurement of Substrate Binding Affinity by Intrinsic Fluorescence Quenching—Binding affinity was determined for a variety of nucleotides, lipids, lipid-like compounds, and other molecules using quenching of the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of purified MsbA. The protein was solubilized in 0.1% (w/v) DM at a concentration of 100 μg/ml in ATPase buffer. Fluorescence measurements were carried out as described previously (22Eckford P.D. Sharom F.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 1022-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Liu R. Siemiarczuk A. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14927-14938Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) using a PTI QuantaMaster C-61 steady-state fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, London, Ontario, Canada), with a 2 nm bandwidth for both excitation (λex = 290 nm) and emission (λem = 330 nm). Nucleotides, lipid A, RaLPS, and ReLPS were added as solutions in ATPase buffer, and other compounds were added as DMSO solutions. Data were collected after equilibration at 20 °C for drugs and lipids or 10 °C for nucleotides (to limit hydrolysis by the protein). Fluorescence data were corrected for inner filter effect, dilution, and scattering, where appropriate (25Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and fitted to Equation 1, which describes binding to a single site, (ΔFF0×100)=(ΔFmaxF0×100)×[S]Kd+[S](Eq. 1) where (ΔF/F0 × 100) is the percent fluorescence quenching (percent change in fluorescence relative to the initial value, F0), following addition of substrate at a concentration [S], and Kd is the dissociation constant for binding to the protein. Fitting was carried out using nonlinear regression (SigmaPlot, SPSS Inc., Chicago), and values of Kd and the maximum percent fluorescence quenching, (ΔFmax/F0 × 100), were extracted. Control titrations were performed with 30 μm NATA to assess the nonspecific quenching of Trp fluorescence by nucleotides, lipids, and drugs. Fluorescence Quenching of MsbA by Acrylamide—A stock solution of freshly prepared 5 m acrylamide in ATPase buffer was added in 2-μl aliquots to 250 μl of 100 μg/ml purified MsbA in ATPase buffer with 0.1% (w/v) DM, in the presence or absence of 2 mm ATP and 11 μm lipid A or 10 μm H33342. Fluorescence emission was measured at 330 nm following excitation at 290 nm (slit widths of 2 nm). All data were collected after incubation at 10 °C to limit hydrolysis of ATP, where present, and to allow comparison between samples. Fluorescence intensities were corrected for inner filter effect, dilution, and scattering. Parallel experiments were carried out using NATA to assess acrylamide quenching of the fluorescence of Trp residues accessible in aqueous solution. Quenching data were analyzed using the Stern-Volmer Equation 2, F0F=1+Ksv[Q](Eq. 2) where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of acrylamide, respectively; [Q] is the concentration of acrylamide, and KSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. For a collisional quenching mechanism, a plot of F0/F versus [Q] gives a straight line with a slope of KSV. Isolation and Purification of MsbA—N-terminally His6-tagged E. coli MsbA was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 cells and purified by nickel-chelate chromatography. Isolated bacterial membrane vesicles contained roughly 5–10% MsbA as assessed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE, and purified protein in detergent was >90% pure (Fig. 2). A typical preparation from 2 liters of bacterial culture yielded 160 mg of membrane protein with ATPase-specific activity of ∼100 nmol/min per mg of protein, and 4.5–5.0 mg of purified MsbA in detergent solution with specific activity of ∼0.9–1.0 μmol/min per mg of protein. Maximal ATPase activity was reached at ATP concentrations greater than 5 mm and 5 mm MgCl2. A 20-min assay time was used, because ATP hydrolysis was still linear at times beyond this period. The addition of DTE to the buffers at a concentration of 2 mm increased the measured ATPase activity of the protein 5-fold compared with the value in its absence. The oligomeric state of MsbA in DM solution was assessed using gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography. Results showed that when compared with protein standards of known size, the elution volume of the MsbA peak corresponded to an estimated molecular mass of ∼145 kDa (Fig. 3). Although bound DM will contribute to the protein size (pure DM micelles have a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa), it seems likely that MsbA exists as a dimer under these conditions. Traces of a band with molecular weight corresponding to the MsbA dimer could also be observed on SDS-PAGE of the purified protein (Fig. 2). Because dimerization of the NB domains is necessary for catalysis in ABC proteins, it is likely that monomeric MsbA would have very low ATPase activity. MsbA was reconstituted into proteoliposomes of E. coli lipids using DM to solubilize the lipid and MsbA, and Biobeads for detergent removal. Proteoliposome size measurements made using dynamic light scattering indicated that E. coli lipid-MsbA proteoliposomes prepared using this method were large, with a mean diameter of around 1.8 μm (data not shown). The size profile of the proteoliposomes was monodisperse and reproducible. Aggregation of smaller proteoliposomes cannot be ruled out, but a broad size distribution would be expected in this case. Reconstitution lowered the activity of the protein by ∼3-fold. Permeabilization of the proteoliposomes by the detergent CHAPS increased the ATPase activity by ∼50%, suggesting that 23 of the MsbA molecules are reconstituted with their NB domains on the outer surface of largely unilamellar structures. Effect of Lipids and Other Compounds on the ATPase Activity of MsbA—The ATPase activity of many ABC proteins can be stimulated and/or inhibited by their substrates. The specific activity of MsbA in DM buffer was stimulated 1.4-fold by egg PE and up to 2-fold by a mixture of E. coli lipids (data not shown), which contains PE, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine, and smaller amounts of other species such as lipid A. Addition of lipid A to purified MsbA stimulated ATPase activity more than 2-fold and did not inhibit the activity of the protein up to the highest concentration that could be easily tested, whereas RaLPS and ReLPS stimulated the activity by a more modest 20% at low concentrations and inhibited the activity at higher concentrations (Fig. 4; Table 1). The ATPase activity of MsbA was also modulated by some drugs that are substrates for drug efflux pumps such as LmrA and Pgp (Fig. 5; Table 1). Four different patterns of modulation were evident. Although drugs such as colchicine and daunorubicin neither stimulated nor inhibited the activity of MsbA in the range normally examined for Pgp (Fig. 5A), compounds such as H33342 (Fig. 5B) stimulated activity at low concentrations and inhibited it at higher concentrations. The lipid-based drugs D-20133 (Fig. 5C) and D-21266, along with LY335979 and leupeptin (Table 1), inhibited ATPase activity but did not stimulate it at lower concentrations. Finally, verapamil displayed stimulation but no inhibition of MsbA ATPase activity up to a concentration of 0.5 mm (Fig. 5D; Table 1). We observed only modest inhibition of ∼28% of the initial activity at a very high concentration of 8.1 mm.TABLE 1Effect of bacterial lipids, lipid-like compounds and drugs on MsbA ATPase activityCompoundConcentrationSC50aConcentration at which ATPase activity is 50% of the maximal observed stimulation is shown.StimulationbMaximal stimulation of ATPase activity by the compound is shown.IC50cConcentration at which ATPase activity is inhibited by 50% is shown.InhibitiondMaximal inhibition of ATPase activity by the compound is shown.μm%μm%Bacterial lipids Lipid A65eConcentration is given in micrograms/ml.>120—f— indicates no observed stimulation or inhibition.— RaLPS0.23eConcentration is given in micrograms/ml.2048eConcentration is given in micrograms/ml.87 ReLPS0.35eConcentration is given in micrograms/ml.2150eConcentration is given in micrograms/ml.82Lipid-like compounds D-20133——5194 D-21266——80100 Ilmofosine1227115>90Drugs Colchicine———— Daunorubicin———— H333427.5179>1000>25 Leupeptin——480>55 LY335979——>1000>49 Verapamil10073—— Vinblastine——>500>34a Concentration at which ATPase activity is 50% of the maximal observed stimulation is shown.b Maximal stimulation of ATPase activity by the compound is shown.c Concentration at which ATPase activity is inhibited by 50% is shown.d Maximal inhibition of ATPase activity by the compound is shown.e Concentration is given in micrograms/ml.f — indicates no observed stimulation or inhibition.

(n = 3), and where not visible, error bars are contained within the symbols.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of Trapping Agents on the ATPase Activity of MsbA—Vanadate (Vi) is a pentavalent phosphate analog frequently employed to trap ABC proteins (and other ATPases) in a conformation that is thought to resemble the catalytic transition state. After one round of ATP hydrolysis, Vi displaces Pi from the active site, trapping ADP to form a stable complex that displays no ATPase activity. Membrane vesicles isolated from E. coli cells overexpressing MsbA displayed inhibition of ATPase activity when treated with increasing concentrations of Vi (Fig. 6A). The residual activity of 30–35% at high concentrations of Vi may represent the catalytic activity of other ATPases in the E. coli membrane that are not sensitive to Vi inhibition. Purified MsbA reconstituted into proteoliposomes of E. coli lipids also displayed inhibition by Vi at similar concentrations, suggesting that most of the ATPase activity observed in membranes may be attributable to MsbA (Fig. 6B). The residual activity present at high Vi concentrations is lower for reconstituted MsbA than E. coli membranes, and thus a portion (10–15%) of the residual activity in membranes may be attributed to Vi-insensitive contaminating ATPases, whereas the remainder may be an intrinsic property of the protein. The Vi concentration causing half-maximal inhibition of reconstituted MsbA ATPase activity was ∼15 μm. The presence of the divalent cation Co2+ in the buffer supported the hydrolysis of ATP by MsbA in the absence of Mg2+, with an optimal concentration of 2.5 mm, but with lower specific activity (data not shown). Aluminum fluoride (AlFx) and beryllium fluoride (BeFx) trap Pgp in similar complexes thought to resemble the transition state and ground state of the protein, respectively (26Russell P.L. Sharom F.J. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both of these reagents also inhibited MsbA ATPase activity (data not shown). Intrinsic Fluorescence of the MsbA Protein—The MsbA monomer includes five Trp residues near the N-terminal end of the protein (Fig. 1). In the x-ray crystal structure of AMP-PNP-bound MsbA, these residues are located close to the end of the TM helix boundaries (5Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to assume that the Trp residues are in fact located in this region, because aromatic residues commonly cluster in the membrane interfacial zone. We examined the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of MsbA in detergent solution, with excitation at 290 nm to avoid emission from the 13 Tyr residues present in each monomer (Fig. 7). The observed emission maximum of 325 nm was highly blue-shifted compared with the water-soluble Trp analog, NATA (348 nm), which suggests that the Trp residues contributing to fluorescence emission reside in a nonpolar environment. Denaturation of MsbA with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) broadened the spectrum, lowered the fluorescence intensity, and caused a large red shift in the emission maximum, which approached that of NATA. Subsequent boiling of the sample red-shifted the emission maximum even further.FIGURE 7Fluorescence emission spectra for purified MsbA and NATA. Corrected fluorescence emission spectra are shown for purified MsbA (100 μg/ml) in DM buffer (solid line, λmax = 325 nm), MsbA following treatment with 6 m GdnHCl (short dash, λmax = 342 nm), MsbA following treatment with 6 m GdnHCl and incubation for 20 min at 100 °C (dotted line, λmax = 345 nm), and 30 μm NATA (long dash, λmax = 348 nm). Fluorescence emission was recorded at 20 °C following excitation at 290 nm (2 nm slit widths).View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W1981274144,"Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a quantitatively minor, but physiologically important, phospholipid in mammalian cells. PS is synthesized by two distinct base-exchange enzymes, PS synthase-1 (PSS1) and PS synthase-2 (PSS2), that are encoded by different genes. PSS1 exchanges serine for choline of phosphatidylcholine, whereas PSS2 exchanges ethanolamine of phosphatidylethanolamine for serine. We previously generated mice lacking PSS2 (Bergo, M. O., Gavino, B. J., Steenbergen, R., Sturbois, B., Parlow, A. F., Sanan, D. A., Skarnes, W. C., Vance, J. E., and Young, S. G. (2002) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 277, 47701–47708) and found that PSS2 is not required for mouse viability. We have now generated PSS1-deficient mice. In light of the markedly impaired survival of Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking PSS1 we were surprised that PSS1-deficient mice were viable, fertile, and had a normal life span. Total serine-exchange activity (contributed by PSS1 and PSS2) in tissues of <i>Pss1</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice was reduced by up to 85%, but except in liver, the PS content was unaltered. Despite the presumed importance of PS in the nervous system, the rate of axonal extension of PSS1-deficient neurons was normal. Intercrosses of <i>Pss1</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice and <i>Pss2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice yielded mice with three disrupted <i>Pss</i> alleles but no double knockout mice. In <i>Pss1</i><sup>–/–</sup>/<i>Pss2</i><sup>–/–</sup> and <i>Pss1</i><sup>–/–</sup>/<i>Pss2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice, serine-exchange activity was reduced by 65–91%, and the tissue content of PS and phosphatidylethanolamine was also decreased. We conclude that (i) elimination of either PSS1 or PSS2, but not both, is compatible with mouse viability, (ii) mice can tolerate as little as 10% of normal total serine-exchange activity, and (iii) mice survive with significantly reduced PS and phosphatidylethanolamine content."
https://openalex.org/W2011854550,"The PGC-1 family of regulated coactivators (PGC-1alpha, PGC-1beta, and PRC) plays an important role in directing respiratory gene expression in response to environmental signals. Here, we show that PRC and PGC-1alpha differ in their interactions with nuclear hormone receptors but are highly similar in their direct binding to several nuclear transcription factors implicated in the expression of the respiratory chain. Surprisingly, neither coactivator binds NRF-2(GABP), a multisubunit transcriptional activator associated with the expression of many respiratory genes. However, the NRF-2 subunits and PRC are co-immunoprecipitated from cell extracts indicating that the two proteins exist in a complex in vivo. Several lines of evidence indicate that HCF-1 (host cell factor 1), a major chromatin component, mediates the association between PRC and NRF-2. Both PRC and NRF-2beta bind HCF-1 in vitro, and the molecular determinants required for the interactions of each with HCF-1 are also required for PRC trans-activation through promoter-bound NRF-2. These determinants include a consensus HCF-1 binding site on PRC and the NRF-2 activation domain. In addition, PRC and NRF-2beta can complex with HCF-1 in vivo, and all three associate with NRF-2-dependent nuclear genes that direct the expression of the mitochondrial transcription factors, TFB1M and TFB2M. Finally, short hairpin RNA-mediated knock down of PRC protein levels leads to reduced expression of TFB2M mRNA and mitochondrial transcripts for cytochrome oxidase II (COXII) and cytochrome b. These changes in gene expression coincide with a marked reduction in cytochrome oxidase activity. The results are consistent with a pathway whereby PRC regulates NRF-2-dependent genes through a multiprotein complex involving HCF-1."
https://openalex.org/W1598450396,"Seismic studies indicate that beneath some regions the 520-kilometer seismic discontinuity in Earth's mantle splits into two separate discontinuities (at ∼500 kilometers and ∼560 kilometers). The discontinuity near 500 kilometers is most likely caused by the (Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4 β-to-γ phase transformation. We show that the formation of CaSiO 3 perovskite from garnet can cause the deeper discontinuity, and by determining the temperature dependence for this reaction we demonstrate that regional variations in splitting of the discontinuity arise from variability in the calcium concentration of the mantle rather than from temperature changes. This discontinuity therefore is sensitive to large-scale chemical heterogeneity. Its occurrence and variability yield regional information on the fertility of the mantle or the proportion of recycled oceanic crust."
https://openalex.org/W2160437429,"Valvular heart disease due to congenital abnormalities or pathology is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Understanding the cellular processes and molecules that regulate valve formation and remodeling is required to develop effective therapies. In the developing heart, epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in a subpopulation of endocardial cells in the atrioventricular cushion (AVC) is an important step in valve formation. Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) has been shown to be an important regulator of AVC endocardial cell EMT in vitro and mesenchymal cell differentiation in vivo. Recently Par6c (Par6) has been shown to function downstream of TGFβ to recruit Smurf1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets RhoA for degradation to control apical-basal polarity and tight junction dissolution. We tested the hypothesis that Par6 functions in a pathway that regulates endocardial cell EMT. Here we show that the Type I TGFβ receptor ALK5 is required for endocardial cell EMT. Overexpression of dominant negative Par6 inhibits EMT in AVC endocardial cells, whereas overexpression of wild-type Par6 in normally non-transforming ventricular endocardial cells results in EMT. Overexpression of Smurf1 in ventricular endocardial cells induces EMT. Decreasing RhoA activity using dominant negative RhoA or small interfering RNA in ventricular endocardial cells also increases EMT, whereas overexpression of constitutively active RhoA in AVC endothelial cells blocks EMT. Manipulation of Rac1 or Cdc42 activity is without effect. These data demonstrate a functional role for Par6/Smurf1/RhoA in regulating EMT in endocardial cells.

Artman M. Colvin S.B. Schwartz S. I Schwartz's Principles of Surgery, 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Health Professions Division, New York1999: 845-908Google Scholar). The majority of these defects include abnormalities of valve formation. Valvular injury in adults occurs as a result of infection (4Mylonakis E. Calderwood S.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 1318-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar), pharmacological therapy (5Connolly H.M. Crary J.L. McGoon M.D. Hensrud D.D. Edwards B.S. Edwards W.D. Schaff H.V. N. Engl. J.

Circulation. 1995; 92: 790-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Together, these factors result in over 100,000 Americans a year undergoing surgery to repair or replace heart valves (7American Heart AssociationHeart and Stroke Statistical Update. 2008; (Dallas, TX)Google Scholar). Valve formation is initiated in the region between the common atria and ventricle and in the distal aspect of the common outflow tract when the heart is a simple tubular structure composed of two concentric cylinders of epithelia separated by a gel-like matrix termed the cardiac jelly. A critical step in valvulogenesis is the transformation of a subpopulation of endocardial cells from the inner cell layer into mesenchymal cells that invade the cardiac jelly and later contribute to the connective tissue of the valves and septa of the adult heart (8Sadler T.W. Tracy T. M Langman's Medical Embryology. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1985: 168-214Google Scholar). Transformation occurs at the atrioventricular boundary to initiate formation of the mitral and tricuspid valves and somewhat later in the outflow tract to initiate aortic and pulmonary valve formation. Endocardial cell transformation is dependent on factors derived from the myocardium that diffuse through the cardiac jelly (9Bernanke D.H. Markwald R.R. Dev. Biol. 1982; 91: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because only a subset of endothelial cells become mesenchyme, it is important to reveal the mechanisms regulating transformation that balance the ratio of transformed to non-transformed cells. Although much of the later mechanisms of valve maturation are poorly understood, it is clear that cushion mesenchyme is critical to the process of valve formation (8Sadler T.W. Tracy T. M Langman's Medical Embryology. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore1985: 168-214Google Scholar, 10Keller B.B. Markwald R.R. Alexander R.W. Schlant R.C.

Desgrosellier J.S. Birth Defects Res. Part C Embryo. Today. 2003; 69: 58-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this assay, transformation can be divided into three steps based on cellular morphology. Endocardial cells separate from the epithelial sheet and elongate in a step termed activation. Next, elongate mesenchymal cells enter the matrix, a step termed invasion. Finally, cells migrate through the gel in the migration step. These three steps, activation, invasion, and migration, constitute EMT. As in the developing heart, EMT is tightly restricted where endocardial cells in AVC explants undergo EMT, whereas endocardial cells in the ventricle do not (9Bernanke D.H. Markwald R.R. Dev. Biol. 1982; 91: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Transforming cells alter their pattern of gene expression down-regulating molecules such as the endothelial marker platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and up-regulating smooth muscle α actin and procollagen type I (12Brown C.B. Boyer A.S. Runyan R.B. Barnett J.V. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Sugi Y. Yamamura H. Okagawa H. Markwald R.R. Dev. Biol. 2004; 269: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). EMT can be quantified by counting the number of cells in the gel, and molecules may be scored for the ability to induce loss-of-function in AVC explants or gain-of-function in ventricular explants. TGFβ is a key regulator of endocardial cell EMT (reviewed in Ref. 11Barnett J.V. Desgrosellier J.S. Birth Defects Res. Part C Embryo. Today. 2003; 69: 58-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).

Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar) ligand binding to TGFβR2 results in recruitment of TGFβR1, activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 5, to the complex. The constitutively active kinase of TGFβR2 phosphorylates and activates the kinase domain of ALK5, which subsequently phosphorylates and activates downstream receptor-associated (R-) Smads 2 and 3 (15Kretzschmar M.

Science. 1999; 283: 2080-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and targeted inactivation of the gene encoding TGFβR3 results in embryonic death at E14.5 associated with abnormalities of epicardial cell EMT and a failure of coronary vessel development (29Compton L.A. Potash D.A. Brown C.B. Barnett J.V. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Recently a novel signaling pathway has been described in which Par6 acts downstream of TGFβ to control apical-basal polarity in mouse NMuMG cells (30Ozdamar B. Bose R. Barrios-Rodiles M. Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Wrana J.L. Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Par6 is colocalized to the tight junctions with ALK5 by occludin. TGFβR2 is recruited to the tight junctions by TGFβ addition and phosphorylates Par6 resulting in the recruitment of Smurf1 (31Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Ozdamar B. Ogunjimi A.A. Alexandrova E. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Science. 2003; 302: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Smurf1 ubiquitination of RhoA leads to degradation of RhoA promoting tight junction dissolution and EMT (32Bose R. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we ask if the Par6 signaling pathway regulates EMT in endocardial cells. Using an in vitro model of endocardial cell transformation we demonstrate that ALK5 activity is required for EMT in AVC explants. Overexpression of wild-type Par6 induces EMT in ventricular explants, whereas dominant negative (dn)Par6 blocks EMT in AVC explants. Similarly, overexpression of Smurf1 causes EMT in ventricular endocardial cells. Consistent with a role for Smurf1 in targeting RhoA for degradation, both dnRhoA and siRNA to RhoA caused gain-of-function in ventricular explants, whereas constitutively active (ca)RhoA effectively blocked EMT in AVC explants. Similar manipulations of Rac1 and Cdc42 did not alter EMT, suggesting a selectivity for RhoA in mediating these effects. These data demonstrate that the Par6 pathway is an important mediator of endocardial cell EMT in vitro. Construction of Adenoviral Constructs—Adenoviruses were generated using the pAdEasy system (33He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). All concentrated viruses were titered by performing serial dilutions of the concentrated virus and counting the number of GFP-expressing 293 cells after 18–24 h. The Rho GTPase dominant negative and constitutively active recombinant adenoviruses were prepared and characterized as previously described (34Bayless K.J. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Titers of virus ranged between 109 to 1014 plaque forming units/ml. Injections were adjusted to achieve infection of 20–50% of endocardial cells. Viral Injections and Collagen Gel Assays—Stage 10–12 chick embryos were harvested onto Whatman paper rings and immediately injected with adenovirus in the heart lumen. Injections were performed using 20–50 pulses, ∼50 ms each, delivered by a picospritzer. Fast Green Dye (Sigma) was used to monitor injection of the virus. Immediately after injection, the embryos were placed on egg agar and incubated at 39 °C. After 24 h, ventricular or AVC explants were excised from the infected hearts and placed in culture as described previously (35Desgrosellier J.S. Mundell N.A. McDonnell M.A. Moses H.L. Barnett J.V. Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). After 48 h, the explants were fixed in 0.8% formaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde. GFP expression by virally infected cells was observed on an inverted fluorescent microscope. The phenotype of each GFP-expressing cell was determined and scored as epithelial, activated, or transformed as described (35Desgrosellier J.S. Mundell N.A. McDonnell M.A. Moses H.L. Barnett J.V. Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). Ligand and Inhibitor Addition—TGFβ2 was purchased from R & D Systems. Ligand addition occurred 12 h post placement of explants on collagen pads to allow for attachment of explants. SB431542 was purchased from Sigma, and Calbiochem 616541 was purchased from Calbiochem. Inhibitors were added to conditioning media and preincubated 12 h prior to placement of explants on collagen pads, following removal of media at the time of explant placement. siRNA Treatment of AVC and Ventricular Explants—AVC or ventricular explants were collected in 100 μl of M199 medium (Mediatech, Inc.) at room temperature for each treatment condition. For transfection, first 4 μl of siPORT NeoFX (Ambion) was incubated in a final volume of 100 μl of M199 for 10 min at room temperature. Next, the appropriate final concentration (for 300 μl of total volume) of siRNA derived from 21-bp RNA (target sequence) was added to a final volume of 100 μl. These two tubes were mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature to allow siRNA complexes to form. Next, the 200-μl mixture was added to the 100 μl containing AVCs or ventricular explants, and this solution was incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 45 min. Explants were then placed on conditioned collagen gels and incubated under the same conditions for 48 h. After 48 h explants were fixed in 0.8% formaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 5 min at room temperature and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed explants were scored for the number of mesenchymal cells invading the gel. The siRNA target sequence for RhoA was: 5′-AATTATGTAGCAGATATTGAA-3′. For control siRNA, a scrambled 21-oligonucleotide template containing the same number of the bases of the RhoA siRNA target that did not blast to any gene in the chicken genome, 5′-AGACTGTCGCGTGCTCTGTCC-3′ was used as previously described (36Mercado-Pimentel M.E. Hubbard A.D. Runyan R.B. Dev. Biol. 2007; 304: 420-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). RhoA siRNA and control siRNA were a generous gift from R. Runyan (37Tavares A.L. Mercado-Pimentel M.E. Runyan R.B. Kitten G.T. Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Two independent siRNA constructs against each chicken Par6c and Smurf1 (designated Par6c-A, Par6c-B, Smurf1-A, and Smurf1-B) were designed using Silencer Select custom siRNA (Ambion). The siRNA target sequences for Par6c-A were: sense, 5′-GCCUCCAACUCAUUGCAtt-3′ and antisense, 5′-UCUGCAAUGAGUUGGAGGCga-3′; Par6c-B sense, 5′-CGCAGUACCUCAGCAACUAtt-3′ and antisense: 5′-UAGUUGCUGAGGUACUGCGag-3′; Smurf1-A sense, 5′-GCACAAGGGUUUUAACGAAtt-3′ and antisense, 5′-UUCGUUAAAACCCUUCUGCag-3′; Smurf1-B sense, 5′-GGAACUUGAGCUAAUCAUAtt-3′ and antisense, 5′-UAUGAUUAGCUCAAGUUCCtt-3′. Control siRNA was used for these experiments as described above. All siRNA constructs were confirmed for their ability to decrease mRNA measured by real-time PCR in chick embryonic fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. S2). Additional methods are found in the supplemental materials. ALK5 Kinase Activity Is Required for EMT in Endocardial Cells—We have previously demonstrated that ALK2 is sufficient and required for endocardial cell EMT, whereas ALK5 is not sufficient (35Desgrosellier J.S. Mundell N.A. McDonnell M.A. Moses H.L. Barnett J.V. Dev. Biol. 2005; 280: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have shown that, even if not sufficient, ALK5 activity may be required for TGFβ signaling (38Goumans M.J. Lebrin F. Valdimarsdottir G. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 39Goumans M.J. Valdimarsdottir G. Itoh S. Lebrin F. Larsson J. Mummery C. Karlsson S. ten Dijke P. Mol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). To test whether ALK5 kinase activity is required for endocardial cell EMT, we took advantage of the availability of several specific, small molecule inhibitors of ALK5 kinase activity. Two ALK5 inhibitors with different potency and distinct structural characteristics were chosen, SB431542 and Calbiochem 616451. Each inhibitor or vehicle was added to the collagen gel 12 h prior to the placement of AVC explants isolated from Stage 14 chick embryos. Explants were incubated for 48 h and fixed, and the number of transformed cells was quantitated in each group (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). Transformed cells were defined as those that enter the collagen gel. Both compounds significantly inhibited the number of cells entering the gel. SB431542 at a final concentration of 2.5 μm inhibited the number of cells entering the collagen gel by 71 ± 4% when compared with vehicle (Fig. 1A). Calbiochem 616451 at a final concentration of 150 nm similarly reduced the number of cells that enter the gel by 77 ± 3% when compared with control (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate that ALK5 kinase activity is required for AVC endocardial cell EMT. We have previously determined that TGFβR3 is sufficient and required for endocardial cell EMT in vitro. Blockade of TGFβR3 in AVC explants inhibits EMT. Overexpression of TGFβR3 in non-transforming ventricular endocardial cells, which normally lack TGFβR3 expression, results in EMT following the addition of TGFβ ligand (28Brown C.B. Boyer A.S. Runyan R.B. Barnett J.V. Science. 1999; 283: 2080-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To determine if TGFβR3-mediated EMT requires ALK5 kinase activity, we overexpressed TGFβR3 in ventricular endothelial cells and incubated explants in the presence or absence of 2.5 μm SB431542 plus or minus 250 pm TGFβ2. Stage 10–12 chick embryos were harvested and injected with adenovirus expressing either GFP alone or TGFβR3 and GFP (see supplemental Fig. S1). Injected embryos were cultured 18–24 h, and ventricular explants from embryos between Stages 13 and 15 were excised and placed on collagen gels preincubated with vehicle or SB431542 as above. Twelve hours after explant placement either vehicle or 250 pm TGFβ2 was added, and the incubation continued for an additional 36 h. Explants were fixed and GFP-positive cells scored as epithelial (round cells in a sheet on the surface of the gel), activated (elongated, individual cells on the surface of the gel), or transformed (elongated, individual cells in the collagen gel). Infection with GFP alone defined the basal distribution of cells as epithelial, activated, or transformed (Fig. 1C). The addition of TGFβ did not alter this distribution. Cells infected with TGFβR3 and GFP incubated with vehicle had a distribution comparable to cells infected with GFP alone. In contrast, the addition 250 pm TGFβ2 resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of transformed cells (557%) and a concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells scored as epithelial (57%). Incubation with SB431542 prevented the ability of TGFβ2 to stimulate EMT in TGFβR3-expressing cells. Importantly, incubation with SB431542 did not alter the distribution of cells expressing TGFβR3 and incubated with vehicle. These data demonstrate that ALK5 kinase activity is required for TGFβR3-dependent EMT in endocardial cells. Par6 Is Sufficient and Required for EMT—Par6 has been demonstrated to play a role in TGFβ-stimulated dissolution of tight junctions during EMT (30Ozdamar B. Bose R. Barrios-Rodiles M. Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Wrana J.L. Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Par6 is expressed in several epithelial cell populations in the chick embryo as well as in endocardial cells during embryonic development (data not shown). To test the hypothesis that Par6 activity regulates endocardial cell EMT, we took advantage of our assay where both gain- and loss-of-function experiments can be performed in ventricular and AVC explants, respectively. We chose to overexpress wild-type Par6 in ventricular explants to score for gain-of-function and overexpress dnPar6 in AVC explants to score for loss-of-function. Embryos were injected, and ventricular or AVC explants were harvested and scored as described above. Representative cell phenotypes are depicted (Fig. 2, A–D). Injection of an adenoviral construct coexpressing wild-type Par6 and GFP into normally non-transforming ventricle induced a statistically significant 75% increase in transformed cells with a concomitant decrease in epithelial cells (Fig. 2E). When compared with explants infected with GFP alone, infection by dnPar6-GFP adenovirus in normally transforming AVCs resulted in a larger percentage of GFP-positive cells which are epithelial, with a concomitant 35% decrease in the percentage of GFP-positive cells that are transformed (Fig. 2F). These data demonstrate that Par6 is both sufficient and required for endocardial cell EMT in vitro. As a second independent approach to decrease Par6 activity we delivered siRNA constructs against Par6 to AVC explants. Explants from Stage 14 embryos were harvested. Following incubation with siRNA as described under “Experimental Procedures” the explants were placed on a collagen gel. Explants were fixed and scored after 48 h. As compared with control siRNA, two independent siRNA constructs to Par6 decreased the number of transformed cells by 70% (Fig. 2, G and H). These data are consistent with those obtained using dnPar6 and support a role for Par6 activity in mediating endocardial cell transformation. Smurf1 Is Sufficient and Required for EMT—Given that ALK5 and Par6 are required for EMT in endocardial cells, we sought to determine if Smurf1, which is activated downstream of Par6, is sufficient for transformation. Adenovirus coexpressing Smurf1 and GFP or GFP alone was injected into the heart of Stage 10–12 embryos followed by the harvest of both ventricles and AVCs. Following incubation of explants for 48 h, GFP-positive cells were scored as described. Smurf1 overexpression in the ventricle led to a statistically significant gain-of-function (i.e. EMT) as measured by a 300% increase in the number of transformed cells. This was accompanied by a 23% decrease in epithelial cells. Overexpression of Smurf1 did not cause a significant increase in transformation in the AVC. These data demonstrate that Smurf1 can stimulate EMT, consistent with Smurf1 acting downstream of Par6 (Fig. 3A). To determine if Smurf1 activity is required for endocardial cell transformation, we delivered two independent siRNA constructs against Smurf1 to AVC explants as described earlier. Each construct decreased the number of transformed cells by at least 70% when compared with control siRNA (Fig. 3, B and C). These data demonstrate that Smurf1 is both sufficient and required for endocardial cell EMT in vitro. RhoA Activity Regulates EMT—The activation of Smurf1 downstream of Par6 results in the targeting of RhoA for degradation (30Ozdamar B. Bose R. Barrios-Rodiles M. Wang H.R. Zhang Y. Wrana J.L. Science. 2005; 307: 1603-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used both dn- and caRhoA constructs to determine if the levels of RhoA activity regulate EMT. We chose to overexpress dnRhoA in ventricular explants to score for gain-of-function and overexpress caRhoA in AVC explants to score for loss-of-function. Embryos were injected, and ventricular or AVC explants were harvested and scored as described above. Injection of an adenoviral construct coexpressing dnRhoA and GFP into normally non-transforming ventricle induced a statistically significant 220% increase in transformed cells with a concomitant decrease in epithelial cells (Fig. 4A). Expression of dnRhoA in the AVC had no effect (Fig. 4A). When compared with explants infected with GFP alone, infection by caRhoA-GFP adenovirus in normally transforming AVCs resulted in a larger percentage of GFP-positive cells, which are epithelial, with a concomitant 77% decrease in the percentage of GFP-positive cells that are transformed (Fig. 4A). Expression of caRhoA in ventricular explants also decreased the number of transformed cells, in this case by 90% (Fig. 4A). These data demonstrate that a decrease in RhoA activity is sufficient to induce EMT, whereas increased RhoA activity blocks EMT. As a second independent approach to decrease RhoA activity we delivered siRNA constructs against RhoA to ventricular and AVC explants as described earlier. As compared with control siRNA, addition of siRNA to RhoA results in gain-of-function in ventricular explants as measured by a 690% increase in the number of transformed cells (Fig. 4B). In the AVC, addition of siRNA to RhoA had no effect (Fig. 4C). These data are consistent with those obtained using dnRhoA and support a role for a decrease in RhoA activity in mediating endocardial cell transformation. These data are not consistent with several studies that target an indirect measure of RhoA activity by targeting the Rho kinase (ROCK1/2) downstream of RhoA using a small molecule inhibitor, Y27632 (41Zhao Z. Rivkees S.A. Dev. Biol. 2004; 275: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 42Sakabe M. Ikeda K. Nakatani K. Kawada N. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Yoshida T. Yamagishi T. Nakajima Y. Dev.

Although larval cloning is well documented in echinoderms, identified stimuli for cloning are limited to those associated with conditions favorable for growth and reproduction.

Predator-induced clones were smaller than uncloned larvae, suggesting an advantage against visual predators. Our results offer another ecological context for asexual reproduction: rapid size reduction as a defense."
https://openalex.org/W2054739800,"Proteins destined for import into the nucleus contain nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that are recognized by import receptors termed karyopherins or importins. Until recently, the only nuclear import sequence that had been well defined and characterized was the classical NLS (cNLS), which is recognized by importin alpha. However, Chook and coworkers (Lee, B. J., Cansizoglu, A. E., Süel, K. E., Louis, T. H., Zhang, Z., and Chook, Y. M. (2006) Cell 126, 543-558) have provided new insight into nuclear targeting with their identification of a novel NLS, termed the PY-NLS, that is recognized by the human karyopherin beta2/transportin (Kapbeta2) receptor. Here, we demonstrate that the PY-NLS is conserved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and show for the first time that the PY-NLS is a functional nuclear targeting sequence in vivo. The apparent ortholog of Kapbeta2 in yeast, Kap104, has two known cargos, the mRNA-binding proteins Hrp1 and Nab2, which both contain putative PY-NLS-like sequences. We find that the PY-NLS-like sequence within Hrp1, which closely matches the PY-NLS consensus, is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear import and is also required for receptor binding and protein function. In contrast, the PY-NLS-like sequences in Nab2, which vary from the PY-NLS consensus, are not required for proper import or protein function, suggesting that Kap104 may interact with different cargos using multiple mechanisms. Dissection of the PY-NLS consensus reveals that the minimal PY-NLS in yeast consists of the C-terminal portion of the human consensus, R/H/KX(2-5)PY, with upstream basic or hydrophobic residues enhancing the targeting function. Finally, we apply this analysis to a bioinformatic search of the yeast proteome as a preliminary search for new potential Kap104 cargos."

https://openalex.org/W2074220482,"Although AIMP3/p18 is normally associated with the multi-tRNA synthetase complex via its specific interaction with methionyl-tRNA synthetase, it also works as a tumor suppressor by interacting with ATM, the upstream kinase of p53. To understand the molecular interactions of AIMP3 and the mechanisms involved, we determined the crystal structure of AIMP3 at 2.0-angstroms resolution and identified its potential sites of interaction with ATM. AIMP3 contains two distinct domains linked by a 7-amino acid (Lys57-Ser63) peptide, which contains a 3(10) helix. The 56-amino acid N-terminal domain consists of two helices into which three antiparallel beta strands are inserted, and the 111-amino acid C-terminal domain contains a bundle of five helices (Thr64-Tyr152) followed by a coiled region (Pro153-Leu169). Structural analyses revealed homologous proteins such as yeast glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, Arc1p, EF1Bgamma, and glutathione S-transferase and suggested two potential molecular binding sites. Moreover, mutations at the C-terminal putative binding site abolished the interaction between AIMP3 and ATM and the ability of AIMP3 to activate p53. Thus, this work identified the two potential molecular interaction sites of AIMP3 and determined the residues critical for its tumor-suppressive activity through the interaction with ATM."
https://openalex.org/W2011794647,"Eukaryotic proteasomes have been reported to cleave only once within polyglutamine tracts and then only after the N-terminal glutamine (Venkatraman, P., Wetzel, R., Tanaka, M., Nukina, N., and Goldberg, A. L. (2004) Mol. Cell 14, 95-104). We have obtained results that directly conflict with that report. In the presence of the proteasome activator PA28gamma(K188E) human red cell proteasomes progressively degraded fluorescein-GGQ(10)RR or fluorescein-HPHQ(10)RR into small fragments as shown by size exclusion chromatography and mass spectrometry. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed that proteolytic products arose from cleavage after every glutamine in fluorescein-HPHQ(10)RR, and mass accuracy rules out deamidation of glutamine to glutamic acid as an explanation for peptide degradation. Moreover, degradation cannot be attributed to a contaminating protease because peptide hydrolysis was completely blocked by the proteasome-specific inhibitors, lactacystin and epoxomicin. We conclude that proteasomes cleave repetitively anywhere within a stretch of ten glutamine residues. Thus our results cast doubt on the idea that mammalian proteasomes cannot degrade glutamine-expanded regions within pathogenic polyQ-expanded proteins, such as Huntingtin."
https://openalex.org/W2058933379,"Despite the importance of airspace integrity in vertebrate gas exchange, the molecular pathways that instruct distal lung formation are poorly understood. Recently, we found that fibrillin-1 deficiency in mice impairs alveolar formation and recapitulates the pulmonary features of human Marfan syndrome. To further elucidate effectors involved in distal lung formation, we performed expression profiling analysis comparing the fibrillin-1-deficient and wild-type developing lung. NeuroD, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, fulfilled the expression criteria for a candidate mediator of distal lung development. We investigated its role in murine lung development using genetically targeted NeuroD-deficient mice. We found that NeuroD deficiency results in both impaired alveolar septation and altered morphology of the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells. NeuroD-deficient mice had enlarged alveoli associated with reduced epithelial proliferation in the airway and airspace compartments during development. Additionally, the neuroendocrine compartment in these mice manifested an increased number of neuroepithelial bodies but a reduced number of solitary pulmonary neuroendocrine cells in the neonatal lung. Overexpression of NeuroD in a murine lung epithelial cell line conferred a neuroendocrine phenotype characterized by the induction of neuroendocrine markers as well as increased proliferation. These results support an unanticipated role for NeuroD in the regulation of pulmonary neuroendocrine and alveolar morphogenesis and suggest an intimate connection between the neuroendocrine compartment and distal lung development."
https://openalex.org/W1980423829,"Transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-beta is crucial for regulating transcription of genes involved in a number of diverse cellular processes, including those involved in some cytokine-induced responses. However, the mechanisms that contribute to its diverse transcriptional activity are not yet fully understood. To gain an understanding into its mechanisms of action, we took a proteomic approach and identified cellular proteins that associate with C/EBP-beta in an interferon (IFN)-gamma-dependent manner. Transcriptional mediator (Mediator) is a multisubunit protein complex that regulates signal-induced cellular gene transcription from enhancer-bound transcription factor(s). Here, we report that the Med1 subunit of the Mediator as a C/EBP-beta-interacting protein. Using gene knock-out cells and mutational and RNA interference approaches, we show that Med1 is critical for IFN-induced expression of certain genes. Med1 associates with C/EBP-beta through a domain located between amino acids 125 and 155 of its N terminus. We also show that the MAPK, ERK1/2, and an ERK phosphorylation site within regulatory domain 2, more specifically the Thr(189) residue, of C/EBP-beta are essential for it to bind to Med1. Last, an ERK-regulated site in Med1 protein is also essential for up-regulating IFN-induced transcription although not critical for binding to C/EBP-beta."
https://openalex.org/W2163512235,"Serotonin is involved in a variety of physiological processes in the central nervous system and the periphery. As the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis, tryptophan hydroxylase plays an important role in modulating these processes. Of the two variants of tryptophan hydroxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system, whereas tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) is expressed mostly in peripheral tissues. Although the two enzymes share considerable sequence homology, the regulatory domain of TPH2 contains an additional 41 amino acids at the N terminus that TPH1 lacks. Here we show that the extended TPH2 N-terminal domain contains a unique sequence involved in the regulation of enzyme expression. When expressed in cultured mammalian cells, TPH2 is synthesized less efficiently and is also less stable than TPH1. Removal of the unique portion of the N terminus of TPH2 results in expression of the enzyme at a level similar to that of TPH1, whereas protein chimeras containing this fragment are expressed at lower levels than their wild-type counterparts. We identify a region centered on amino acids 10-20 that mediates the bulk of this effect. We also demonstrate that phosphorylation of serine 19, a protein kinase A consensus site located in this N-terminal domain, results in increased TPH2 stability and consequent increases in enzyme output in cell culture systems. Because this domain is unique to TPH2, these data provide evidence for selective regulation of brain serotonin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1989379557,"Factor VIIa (FVIIa) circulates in the blood in a zymogen-like state. Only upon association with membrane-bound tissue factor (TF) at the site of vascular injury does FVIIa become active and able to initiate blood coagulation. Here we used hydrogen exchange monitored by mass spectrometry to investigate the conformational effects of site-directed mutagenesis at key positions in FVIIa and the origins of enhanced intrinsic activity of FVIIa analogs. The differences in hydrogen exchange of two highly active variants, FVIIaDVQ and FVIIaVEAY, imply that enhanced catalytic efficiency was attained by two different mechanisms. Regions protected from exchange in FVIIaDVQ include the N-terminal tail and the activation pocket, which is a subset of the regions of FVIIa protected from exchange upon TF binding. FVIIaDVQ appeared to adopt an intermediate conformation between the free (zymogen-like) and TF-bound (active) form of FVIIa and to attain enhanced activity by partial mimicry of TF-induced activation. In contrast, exchange-protected regions in FVIIaVEAY were confined to the vicinity of the active site of FVIIa. Thus, the changes in FVIIaVEAY appeared to optimize the active site region rather than imitate the TF-induced effect. Hydrogen exchange analysis of the FVIIaM306D variant, which was unresponsive to stimulation by TF, correlated widespread reductions in exchange to the single mutation in the TF-binding region. These results reveal the delicate interplay between key allosteric sites necessary to achieve the transition of FVIIa into the active form.

Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Upon vascular injury, FVIIa circulating in the blood binds to tissue factor (TF) exposed on extravascular cells and initiates blood coagulation. TF acts as an allosteric regulator and dramatically enhances the activity of FVIIa (2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Similar to most trypsin-like proteases, single-chain zymogen FVII is proteolytically cleaved at a peptide bond adjacent to the protease domain to become the two-chain FVIIa molecule. In trypsin, the new N terminus (residue 16) generated upon endoproteolysis of trypsinogen spontaneously inserts into a cavity termed the activation pocket and forms a salt bridge with residue 194. This key step leads to the formation of a correctly shaped S1pocket of the active site and full catalytic activity. Crystal structures of the trypsin/trypsinogen pair indicate that three loops (referred to as the activation loops) spanning the surface between the activation pocket and the active site become ordered upon activation (3Fehlhammer H. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 4Huber R. Bode W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (610) Google Scholar). FVIIa, however, retains zymogen-like properties after cleavage and exhibits very low enzymatic activity. There is biochemical evidence that the new N-terminal Ile-153(16) of FVIIa (the chymotrypsin numbering is denoted in superscript with parentheses) fails to insert into the activation pocket and that binding of TF facilitates N-terminal insertion and transition to the catalytically competent form of FVIIa (5Higashi S.

Recently, insights into zymogen FVII and the zymogen-like form of FVIIa were obtained by probing the solution structures of these two activation states, and that of TF-bound FVIIa, by hydrogen exchange monitored by mass spectrometry (HX-MS) (10Rand K.D.

The conformations of zymogen FVII and FVIIa were highly similar and confirmed the zymogenicity of FVIIa, whereas TF binding induced widespread conformational changes in multiple regions of the protease domain, e.g. the N terminus, the activation pocket, and the activation loops (10Rand K.D.

Pharmacological doses of recombinant FVIIa can ameliorate the hemostatic defect of patients with hemophilia A or B and inhibitory antibodies. Promising results have also been obtained with FVIIa in non-hemophilic patients after traumatic injury (11Kenet G. Walden R. Eldad A. Martinowitz U. Lancet. 1999; 354 (1879): 1879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 12Martinowitz U. Kenet G. Segal E. Luboshitz J. Lubetsky A. Ingerslev J. Lynn M. J. Trauma. 2001; 51: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). High doses of FVIIa are necessary for treating bleeding episodes in these patients, because FVIIa presumably exerts at least part of its function without TF (13Monroe D.M. Hoffman M. Oliver J.A.

Blood. 2004; 104: 3858-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). New FVIIa variants with enhanced intrinsic activity could therefore potentially be beneficial by offering improved hemostasis. We have discovered several such variants through site-directed mutagenesis in the protease domain of FVIIa and have selected four FVIIa analogs with unique properties for the present study. These are FVIIaM306D, which is unresponsive to activation by TF (15Persson E. Nielsen L.S. Olsen O.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3251-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), FVIIaVEAY, which has optimized activity especially toward small peptidyl substrates (16Persson E. Bak H. Østergaard A. Olsen O.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and FVIIaDVQ and FVIIaDVQA, with dramatically improved activity toward the natural macromolecular substrate factor X (FX) (17Persson E.

FVIIaVEAY contains four mutations in the protease domain, L305(163)V, S314(170B)E, K337(188)A, and F374(225)Y and processes small peptidyl substrates very efficiently with a higher apparent kcat and a reduced Km compared with FVIIa (16Persson E. Bak H. Østergaard A. Olsen O.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Table 1). Similarly, the intrinsic activity toward FX is increased 10-fold. Similar to FVIIaVEAY, FVIIaDVQ possesses increased amidolytic activity toward small peptidyl substrates (predominantly a higher apparent kcat), but most important, it displays a 40-50-fold increased rate of FX activation (17Persson E. Kjalke M. Olsen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13583-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The three mutations in FVIIaDVQ are situated in the N-terminal tail of the heavy chain (V158(21)D) and near the activation pocket (E296(154)V and M298(156)Q) and mimic a sequence motif from thrombin and factor IXa. The related FVIIaDVQA variant has properties similar to those of FVIIaDVQ but with a further increased activity due to the additional K337(188)A mutation (17Persson E. Kjalke M. Olsen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13583-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast to these highly active variants, FVIIaM306D has an intrinsic activity comparable with that of FVIIa. The variant has a single M306(164)D mutation in the TF-binding region of the protease domain. Met-306(164) is the locally most influential residue both in terms of TF binding energy and mediating the allosteric effect of TF (15Persson E. Nielsen L.S. Olsen O.H.

A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, mutation of Met-306(164) abolishes or diminishes the affinity increase toward TF that is induced by incorporation of an active site inhibitor into FVIIa (15Persson E. Nielsen L.S.

The salient property of this variant is that, although FVIIaM306D and FVIIa bind TF with comparable affinity, the activity is virtually unaffected by TF binding demonstrating an abrogated allosteric response to TF (15Persson E.

Open table in a new tab Structural information relating to the intrinsic properties of the individual variants is lacking as it would require the crystallization of free, uninhibited FVIIa, which so far has eluded all attempts. Detailed information about the conformational properties and dynamics of proteins in solution is contained in their HX behavior, and HX rates of native proteins are a sensitive measure of local conformational stability (22Englander S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 741-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Hvidt A. Nielsen S.O. Adv. Protein Chem. 1966; 21: 287-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). HX-MS has become a widely applicable technique, which affords rapid monitoring of protein structural transitions in solution relating to folding, function, and regulation (24Wales T.E. Engen J.R. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2006; 25: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). In this study, we applied HX-MS analyses on a set of FVIIa variants that spanned the entire spectrum of properties obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. The HX profiles of the FVIIa variants were used to provide a structural rationale for the origins of their enhanced intrinsic activity. Moreover, combining the HX analyses allowed us to identify key allosteric sites in the protease domain, which are linked by an intricate network of dynamic cross-talk. HX Reactions and MS Analysis—FVIIaDVQ, FVIIaDVQA, FVIIaVEAY, and FVIIaM306D were obtained as described (15Persson E. Nielsen L.S. Olsen O.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3251-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Persson E. Bak H. Østergaard A. Olsen O.H. Biochem.

Sample preparations of FVIIa variants and soluble human TF-(1-219) (sTF) were done as described previously (10Rand K.D. Jørgensen T.J.D. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Jensen O.N. Stennicke H.R. Andersen M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Amide 1H/2H HX was performed exactly as described earlier (10Rand K.D. Jørgensen T.J.D. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Jensen O.N. Stennicke H.R. Andersen M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and initiated by a 12-fold dilution of a protiated protein stock solution in the presence or absence of cofactor into the corresponding deuterated buffer (i.e. 20 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.0 (uncorrected value), 10 mm CaCl2, 99% D2O). HX reactions were performed at pH 6.0 to better resolve the fast exchanging amides. Non-deuterated controls were prepared by dilution into an identical protiated buffer. All HX reactions were carried out at 25 °C and contained 4.3 μm FVIIa variant in the absence or presence of 21 μm sTF. At appropriate time intervals, aliquots of the HX reaction were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold quenching buffer (1.25 m Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, adjusted to pH 2.15 using NaOH) resulting in a final pH of 2.3 (uncorrected value). Quenched samples were immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. The apparatus used for rapid desalting and subsequent mass analysis was configured as described (10Rand K.D. Jørgensen T.J.D. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Jensen O.N. Stennicke H.R. Andersen M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Positive ion-electrospray ionization mass spectra of eluted peptides were acquired on a LCT mass spectrometer (Waters Corp.). Data Analysis—Peptic peptides were identified in separate experiments using standard collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (CID MS/MS) methods on a Q-TOF 1 instrument (Waters). Average masses of peptide isotopic envelopes were determined from lock mass-corrected centroided data (processed using MassLynx software, Waters) using an Excel spreadsheet. Complete deuteration of control samples was achieved by incubation for 70 h at 37 °C in the presence of 6 m guanidinium chloride (deuterated). Average back exchange (i.e. deuterium loss) was measured as 14% for the analyzed peptides. However, no corrections were made for this deuterium loss because only the relative levels of deuterium incorporation of all samples were compared. All HX experiments were repeated at least twice. Replicate samples of FVIIa after a 100- or 300-s exchange indicated a standard deviation of 0.2 deuterium (n = 3) in the determination of peptide deuterium contents. Significant changes in deuterium incorporation were therefore defined as a difference larger than the double standard deviation, i.e. >0.4 deuteriums. Protein structures were visualized using the software PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). Deglycosylation of FVIIa and FVIIaM306D—PNGase F-catalyzed cleavage of the N-glycosidic linkage to Asn-322(175) in the protease domain was monitored by HPLC for FVIIaM306D in the free form and in complex with sTF as described previously for FVIIa (25Olsen O.H. Rand K.D. Østergaard H. Persson E. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation of FVIIaM306D was carried out at 30 °C in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.0) containing 3 μm FVIIaM306D with or without 6 μm sTF. Reactions were initiated by the addition of PNGase F to a final concentration of 50 units/μl. Aliquots (15 μl) were taken out at timed intervals, and acid was quenched by 8-fold dilution into a solution consisting of 70 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and 10% formic acid and then placed on ice. Prior to HPLC analysis, all samples were heated to 70 °C for 10 min to ensure complete disulfide reduction and separation of heavy and light chains. The glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of the protease domain were separated and quantified by reversed-phase HPLC on a C4 column (Vydac, 300 Å, particle size 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) maintained at 30 °C. Mobile phases consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). Following injection of 25 μl of the sample, the system was run isocratically at 25% solvent B for 4 min followed by a linear gradient from 25-46% B for 10 min during which the light chain, sTF, and PNGase F eluted. Finally, a linear gradient from 46-52% B for 21 min was applied to separate protease domain species. The flow rate was 1.5 ml/min, and peaks were detected by fluorescence using excitation and emission wave-lengths of 280 and 348 nm, respectively. The relative amounts of glycosylated and unglycosylated protease domain were determined by peak integration using Millenium 32 version 4.0 software (Waters). For those reactions where significant protease domain deglycosylation had taken place, time courses were fitted to a monoexponential function to obtain apparent rate constants for the reactions. Carbamylation—FVIIa (1 μm), FVIIaM306D (1 μm), FVIIa/sTF (100 nm/2 μm), and FVIIaM306D/sTF (1 μm/2 μm) were incubated with 0.2 m potassium cyanate at room temperature in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2 (n = 3). The FVIIa or FVIIa/sTF activity was measured at time zero and every 10 min thereafter. A 20-μl sample was withdrawn and mixed with 160 μl of Hepes buffer with 0.1% bovine serum albumin followed by the addition of 20 μl of 10 mm S-2288 (Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden) and amidolytic activity measurement on a SpectraMax 190 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). p-Aminobenzamidine Inhibition—FVIIa (100 nm), FVIIaM306D (100 nm), FVIIa/sTF (10 nm/200 nm), and FVIIaM306D/sTF (100 nm/200 nm) in Hepes buffer (see above) with bovine serum albumin were incubated for 5 min at room temperature in the presence of various concentrations (0-1280 μm)of p-aminobenzamidine (PABA). Residual amidolytic FVIIa or FVIIa/sTF activity was measured as mentioned above by adding S-2288 to a final concentration 1 mm. HX Profiling of Functionally Distinct Variants of FVIIa—The variants FVIIaVEAY, FVIIaDVQ, and FVIIaM306D were previously shown to be bestowed with distinct biochemical properties, in particular increased amidolytic and proteolytic activity and abrogated activation by TF, respectively. In addition to activity measurements, FVIIaVEAY and FVIIaDVQ were characterized in experiments that indirectly probed the structure of the protease domain by measuring the propensity for insertion of the N terminus (susceptibility of the amino group of Ile-153(16) to carbamylation) or by assessing the functionality of the S1 pocket by PABA inhibition (16Persson E. Bak H. Østergaard A. Olsen O.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Persson E. Kjalke M. Olsen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13583-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We subjected FVIIaM306D to the same tests; an overview of the available biochemical data on the FVIIa variants is presented in Table 1. In search of a detailed structural rationale for the unique properties of these FVIIa variants and to gain insight into the functional dynamics of the FVIIa protease domain, we subsequently probed each variant for sites of conformational changes by HX-MS analysis. HX was initiated by dilution of the protein into deuterated buffer and deuterium labeling of accessible sites in the protein was allowed to proceed for various exchange times. Localization of deuterium labels on amide groups of the protein backbone was subsequently achieved by denaturation and digestion with pepsin under acidic HX quench conditions to retain the deuterium labels. The resulting peptic peptides were separated by HPLC, and the time-resolved deuterium content of each peptide were analyzed by electrospray MS. In this manner, 24 corresponding peptides from the protease domain were identified for FVIIaVEAY, FVIIaDVQ, FVIIaDVQA, and FVIIaM306D (Fig. 2a and supplemental Fig. 1, a and b) and used to monitor the HX for 225 of a total of 253 backbone amide hydrogens (90% of the FVIIa protease domain). Replicate HX measurements indicated a standard deviation of 0.2 deuteriums (n = 3) in determination of peptide deuterium contents. An example of raw HX-MS data, in this case on peptide 6 (residues 207-220(67-80)) of FVIIaVEAY, FVIIaDVQ, and FVIIa after exchange for 10 s, is shown in Fig. 2b. Each peptide reports on the HX of all of its amide hydrogens (side-chain hydrogens are not detected) except for the N-terminal amide hydrogen (26Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). The HX profiles of the FVIIa variants, in the presence and absence of TF, revealed significantly reduced HX in several different peptides, suggestive of conformational stabilization in distinct regions relative to FVIIa. Although the HX of the light chain of the FVIIa analogs was largely identical to that of FVIIa (data not shown), 4A single peptide in both FVIIaDVQ and FVIIaDVQA, comprising the C-terminal part of the light chain and located spatially close to the N terminus of the protease domain, showed moderately reduced HX compared with FVIIa. This segment, referred to as the interchain linker, showed similar reduction in HX upon TF binding to FVIIa. the protection from HX could be localized to numerous functionally important segments of the FVIIa protease domain, many of which were previously found to be exchange-protected during the allosteric response induced by TF binding (10Rand K.D. Jørgensen T.J.D. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Jensen O.N. Stennicke H.R. Andersen M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23018-23024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). HX Behavior of the Highly Active FVIIaDVQ Variant—The three mutations in FVIIaDVQ, situated in the N-terminal tail of the heavy chain (V158(21)D) and near the activation pocket (E296(154)V and M298(156)Q), have a profound effect on the HX of several regions of the protease domain (Fig. 3b). Locally, at the site of mutagenesis, the N-terminal tail (peptide 1: residues 153-169(16-32), Fig. 4) displayed reduced HX, indicating a stabilization of this key part of the protease domain (Fig. 1). In support of this observation, the loss of activity of FVIIaDVQ upon carbamylation occurred drastically slower compared with FVIIa, confirming an increased burial of the N terminus in this analog (Table 1). However, protection from HX was also observed in neighboring regions of the protease domain. This includes β-strand A2 (peptide 11: residues 275-287(129F-144), Fig. 4) forming part of the activation pocket for N-terminal insertion (Fig. 1). Likewise, moderately reduced HX was observed in activation loop 1 (sublocalization via peptides 12 and 13, supplemental Fig. 1, a and b), activation loop 2 (peptide 18: residues 332-356(184-207). Fig. 5) and activation loop 3 (peptide 20: residues 361-377(212-228), Fig. 5), all three closely situated on one face of the protease domain spanning the region between the active site cleft and the activation pocket (Fig. 1). The Ca2+-binding loop (peptide 5: residues 207-220(67-80), Fig. 4), whose conformation and binding of Ca2+ has been correlated to increased activity of several trypsin-like proteases including FVIIa (27Bode W.

As expected, the related FVIIaDVQA variant displayed very similar HX behavior to FVIIaDVQ. However, although FVIIaDVQ displayed only minor protection from HX in activation loop 2 (peptide 18: residues 332-356(184-207); Fig. 5), the corresponding region of FVIIaDVQA, which contains the additional K337(188)A mutation, clearly underwent substantially slower HX.FIGURE 5Reduced HX of FVIIa variants in the vicinity of the active site.

Among them, Rhodobacter capsulatus uses both a freely diffusible and a membrane-anchored cytochrome (cyt) (c2 and cy, respectively) electron carrier between the ubihydroquinone (QH2):cyt c oxidoreductase (cyt bc1 complex) and either the photochemical reaction center (RC) or the cbb3-type cyt c oxidase (Cox) under Ps or respiratory growth conditions, respectively (5Jenney Jr., F.E.

In contrast, the closely related Rhodobacter sphaeroides relies exclusively on the soluble cyt c2 for its Ps growth (8Donohue T.J. McEwan A.G. Van Doren S. Crofts A.R. Kaplan S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1918-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), even though it has a membrane-bound cyt cy that is functional only under respiratory growth conditions (9Myllykallio H.

Noticeably, the linker of R. capsulatus cyt cy is markedly longer than that of R. sphaeroides and other non-Ps bacterial cyt cy (Fig. 1A). A seminal finding was that R. sphaeroides mutants lacking cyt c2 can be complemented for Ps growth by R. capsulatus cyt cy (12Jenney Jr., F.E. Prince R.C. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys.

Occurrence of larger, nontransient macromolecular structures, ensuring efficient substrate channeling, catalytic enhancement, and sequestration of reactive intermediates during electron transport have been proposed to occur in membranes of purple bacteria (14Vermeglio A. Joliot P. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 435-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), plants (15Eubel H. Jansch L. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and mitochondria (16Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). However, as the membrane-embedded components can diffuse independently from one another within lipid bilayers, differentiating between static “hardwired” electron transport complexes from those undergoing random collisions (17Hackenbrock C.R. Chazotte B. Gupte S.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 331-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) is difficult to document in Ps membranes (18Crofts A.R. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 105-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the accompanying work (38Öztürk Y. Lee D.-W. Mandaci S. Osyczka A. Prince R.C. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13964-13972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated by creating soluble variants of cyt cy (cyt S-cy) that this electron carrier needs not be membrane anchored to support Ps growth of R. capsulatus. In this work, we have exploited the functional cyt bc1-cy fusion complex that we constructed earlier by fusing genetically cyt cy to the cyt bc1 complex (19Lee D.W. Ozturk Y. Mamedova A. Osyczka A. Cooley J.W. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) to probe the physical proximities of the Ps components to one another in R. capsulatus. We surmised that if the native length of the cyt cy linker is optimized for efficient electronic coupling across the distance between the cyt bc1 complex and the RC, then progressively shortening it might divulge the minimal distances separating these physiological partners in Ps membranes. Characterization of the physicochemical properties of both membrane-embedded and highly purified cyt bc1-cy fusion complex variants indicate that the shortest functional cyt cy linker is about 45 residues long. This short linker still insures rapid ET from the cyt bc1 to the RC, but exhibits decreased electronic coupling to the RC, thereby limiting cyclic ET and Ps growth. Thus, Ps cyclic ET components appear to be tightly packed together, forming membrane-embedded large structural complexes. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. R. capsulatus strains were grown at 35 °C in mineral-peptone-yeast extract-enriched media (MPYE) supplemented with antibiotics as needed (10, 2.5, and 10 μg/ml kanamycin, tetracycline, and spectinomycin, respectively) under either semiaerobic/dark (respiratory), or photoheterotrophic/light (Ps) conditions using anaerobic jars and H2 + CO2 generating gas packs (BD Biosciences), as described previously (20Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ps growth curves were obtained using screw-cap tubes, incubated at 35 °C in an aquarium filled with water and illuminated by tungsten (Lumiline, Sylvania) lamps at an intensity of 150 μE/m2/s. Culture turbidity was monitored with a Klett-Summerson photometer equipped with a red (number 66) filter as described (21Daldal F. Cheng S. Applebaum J. Davidson E. Prince R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using mutagenic primers YO5EcoRV (5′-GCCGGGGGATATCTGCTCGTCAAGACGCACATC-3′) and YO6HindIII (5′-GCCGGGGCAAGCTTGCAAAGATGTGAGGGC-3′) replaced the initiating methionine (ATG) of cycY with leucine (CTG). This PCR product was then digested with EcoRV and HindIII restriction enzymes and ligated into the StuI and HindIII sites of plasmid pMTS1 (20Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), to yield pYO37 containing a petABC::cycY fusion without the stop codon (TGA) of petC (cyt c1). The BamHI-HindIII fragment of pYO37 was transferred into the same sites of the broad host range plasmid pRK415, yielding pYO38 (Table 1). Similarly, two additional in-frame deletion derivatives of pYO38 (Δ19 and Δ24 in the linker region of cyt cy) of the cycY-FLAG fusion were obtained by appropriate PCR amplification of the 0.7-kb carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged version of cycY, yielding pYO32 (petABC::cycY-FLAG-Δ19) and pYO29 (petABC::cycY-FLAG-Δ24), respectively, and transferred to the BamHI-HindIII sites of pRK415 to yield pYO33 and pYO30, respectively. All constructs were subsequently verified by DNA sequencing. A Δ(petABC::gen) insertion-deletion allele was constructed by replacing the 2.4-kb ApaLI-StuI fragment of petABC in plasmid pMTS1 with the 1.2-kb HindIII-BamHI fragment containing the gentamycin resistance gene by blunt end ligation, yielding pYO34. This Δ(petABC::gen) allele was then transferred using Gene Transfer Agent into the chromosome of R. capsulatus strain FJ2 (ΔcycA, ΔcycY) (5Jenney Jr., F.E. Daldal F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) to yield the triple mutant YO2, lacking both the cyt bc1 complex and electron carrier cyts c2 and cy. Biochemical Techniques—Intracytoplasmic (chromatophore) membranes were prepared as described previously (19Lee D.W. Ozturk Y. Mamedova A. Osyczka A. Cooley J.W. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), except where noted 1 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid and 100 mm EDTA were added to minimize proteolysis following cell disruption. The R. capsulatus cyt bc1 complex was purified as described previously (22Valkova-Valchanova M.B. Saribas A.S. Gibney B.R. Dutton P.L. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16242-16251Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (23Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE (15%) were run as described in Ref. 24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205531) Google Scholar, and prior to loading, samples were solubilized in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue with subsequent incubation at 60 °C for 10 min. Cytochromes c were visualized by their heme peroxidase activities using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMBZ) and H2O2 according to Thomas et al. (25Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic Techniques—Optical spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer UV-visible spectrophotometer Lambda 20. Absorption difference spectra for the c- and b-type cytochromes were obtained using chromatophore membranes (0.3 mg of total protein/ml), oxidized by adding a crystal of potassium ferricyanide, and reduced by a few grains of either solid sodium ascorbate or sodium dithionite, as appropriate. Time-resolved, light-activated kinetic spectroscopy was performed on a dual wavelength kinetic spectrophotometer with chromatophore membranes resuspended in 50 mm MOPS buffer containing 100 mm KCl (pH 7.0) in the presence of the following redox mediators (with their respective midpoint redox potential, Em,7): 100 μm ferricyanide (430 mV), 8 μm 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (260 mV), 6 μm 1,2-naphthoquinone (NQ, 145 mV), 1 μm phenazine methosulfate (80 mV), 1 μm phenazine ethosulfate (50 mV), 6 μm 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HNQ, -145 mV), 6 μm benzyl viologen (-359 mV), and a membrane potential uncoupler (2.5 μm valinomycin), as described (26Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The amount of chromatophore membranes used in each assay was normalized to the RC content, as determined by measuring the flash-induced optical absorbance difference between 605 and 540 nm at an Eh of 380 mV, and using an extinction coefficient of 29.8 mm-1 cm-1. Transient cyt c re-reduction and cyt b reduction kinetics at an ambient potential of 100 mV, initiated by a short saturating flash (∼8 μs) from a xenon lamp were followed at 550-540 and 560-570 nm, respectively. Antimycin, myxothiazol, and stigmatellin were used as indicated at 5, 5, and 1 μm, respectively. Optical potentiometric titrations were performed with the purified cyt bc1-cy fusion complex (0.1 mg/ml) in 50 mm MOPS buffer (100 mm KCl, pH 7.0) with the following mediators: 20 μm tetrachlorohydroquinone (350 mV), 20 μm 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, 20 μm 1,2-naphthoquinone 4-sulfonate (210 mV), 20 μm NQ, 10 μm phenazine methosulfate, 10 μm phenazine ethosulfate, 40 μm duroquinone (5 mV), 20 μm pyocyanine (PCN, -34 mV), 6 μm indigotrisulfonate (-90 mV), 20 μm HNQ, 20 μm anthroquinone 2-sulfonate (-225 mV). The optical changes that accompanied the Eh changes were recorded in the α-band region (500 to 600 nm), and the Em values were determined by fitting the normalized absorption data to a single component n = 1 Nernst equation. EPR spectroscopy was performed at sample temperatures of 10 or 20 K using a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer (Bruker Biosciences), fitted with an Oxford instruments ESR-9 helium cryostat (Oxford Instrumentation Inc.). Spectrometer settings were as indicated in the appropriate figure legends. Purification of the Cyt bc1-cy Fusion Complex—The R. capsulatus cyt bc1-cy fusion complex was purified using pYO38/YO2. Chromatophore membranes (5.9 g wet weight) were obtained from frozen washed cells (81 g wet weight) after two passages through a French pressure cell and collected by ultracentrifugation (20Atta-Asafo-Adjei E. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Chromatophore pellets were resuspended to a final protein concentration of 18 mg/ml in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 7.2 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm EDTA, 10 protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) and 1 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid. Dodecyl maltoside (DDM, 20% w/v stock solution) was added dropwise to this suspension to a final concentration of 1 mg of DDM/mg of total proteins. The mixture was stirred gently for 1 h at 4 °C, and then ultracentrifuged (120,000 × g for 2 h) to eliminate non-dispersed membranes. The supernatant was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose ff column (2.6 × 32 cm) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 20% glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) DDM, and 7.2 mm NaCl (Buffer A). The column was washed with 5 to 6 column volumes (CVs) of Buffer A containing 400 mm NaCl, and then the remaining photosynthetic pigments were washed with 3 to 4 CVs of the same buffer containing 0.05% (w/v) DDM until a red band on top of the column became visible. The adsorbed cyt bc1-cy fusion proteins were eluted with 4 CVs of a linear 400-800 mm NaCl gradient in the presence of 0.05% (w/v) DDM. Fractions were monitored for their absorption at 280 and 420 nm, and 500 to 600 nm for their dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized optical difference spectra, and those containing the highest concentrations of c-type and b-type cytochromes were pooled, concentrated using an Amicon Diaflo apparatus equipped with a PM30 membrane. The concentrated sample (∼33 ml) was passed twice through an anti-FLAG M2 affinity column (5 ml), pre-equilibrated with 10 CVs of 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.01% (w/v) DDM. The column was then washed with 20 CVs of the same buffer, and eluted with 6 CVs of 100 mm glycine-HCl buffer (pH 3.5) containing 0.01% (w/v) DDM. Eluents were collected into vials containing 1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 50 mm. Fractions containing the cyt bc1-cy fusion complex were pooled, buffer exchanged with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.01% (w/v) DDM using Amicon Ultra (50,000 Mr cut off) centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Co., Ireland), and stored at -80 °C in the presence of 20% glycerol until further use. Design of the Cyt bc1-cy Fusion Complexes with Shorter Cyt cy Linker Lengths—The availability of a functional cyt bc1-cy fusion complex (19Lee D.W. Ozturk Y. Mamedova A. Osyczka A. Cooley J.W. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) allowed us to probe whether the cyt cy linker could be used as a “molecular ruler” to estimate the distances between the Ps ET components. Comparison of R. capsulatus cyt cy with its counterparts from other species indicated that the cyt c domain is highly similar to that from Silicibacter pomeroyi (71%), Paracoccus denitrificans (70%), and R. sphaeroides (65%). On the other hand, the linker regions of P. denitrificans, R. sphaeroides, and S. pomeroyi are about 20 to 30 residues shorter than that of R. capsulatus (Fig. 1A). Generation of computer-assisted hypothetical three-dimensional structures of the cyt bc1-cy fusion complexes with shorter linkers directed us to the region between amino acids 65 and 90 of cyt cy to mimic its non-functional variants as Ps electron carriers (Fig. 1B). Considering that the R. sphaeroides cyt cy linker is 26 amino acids shorter than its R. capsulatus counterpart, plasmids pYO30 (with a 24-amino acid long deletion between positions Ala63 and Pro88 of cyt cy) (Δ24-cy) and pYO33 (with a 19-amino acid long deletion between the positions Ala67 and Pro88 of cyt cy) (Δ19-cy) were constructed to determine the Ps ET of each electron carrier (Table 1). Phenotypic Characterization of R. capsulatus Strains Harboring Cyt bc1-cy Fusion Complex Variants with Shorter Cyt cy Linkers—Plasmids pYO30 (Δ24-cy) and pYO33 (Δ19-cy) were introduced into the R. capsulatus mutant YO2 (lacking the cyts bc1, c2, and cy), and the Ps growth abilities of the resulting strains were examined (Fig. 2A). On enriched MPYE medium under Ps conditions, R. capsulatus strain pMTS1/MT-RBC1 overproducing cyt bc1 complex, MT-G4/S4 lacking the cyt c2, and pYO38/YO2 harboring an intact cyt bc1-cy fusion complex exhibited doubling times of about 192, 216, and 300 min, respectively (Fig. 2A). However, under similar conditions, pYO33/YO2 (Δ24-cy) and pYO30/YO2 (Δ19-cy) grew markedly slower than pYO38/YO2 (native-cy) (756 and 498 versus 300 min, respectively). As the mutant YO2 cannot be complemented for Ps growth by either the cyt bc1 complex or cyt cy alone, the data indicated that the cyt bc1-cy fusion complexes with shorter cyt cy linkers provided both the oxidoreductase and electron carrier functions required for Ps growth. However, the slower growth rates suggested that shortening the cyt cy linker hampered the growth abilities of PS. Prosthetic Group Insertion, Enzymatic Activity, and Subunit Assembly of the Cyt bc1-cy Fusion Complexes—As the slower Ps growth might also be attributed to decreased amounts of cyt bc1-cy fusion complexes, chromatophore membranes of appropriate strains were examined by TMBZ/SDS-PAGE analyses (Fig. 2B). Typical membrane-associated c-type cytochrome profiles comprised of the cyts cp (32 kDa), c1 (30 kDa), cy (29 kDa), and co (28 kDa) were observed for pMTS1/MT-RBC1 and MT-G4/S4, whereas the YO2-derived samples contained only cyts cp and co (both subunits of Cox) as expected. On the other hand, pYO38/YO2, pYO33/YO2, and pYO30/YO2 harboring cyt bc1-cy fusion complexes with shorter cyt cy linkers had both cyts c1 and cy bands replaced by a single peroxidase-active band at 61, 59, and 58 kDa, respectively, corresponding to their cyt c1-cy fusion subunits. Steady-state enzymatic activities of the cyt bc1 complexes were also assayed by measuring DBH2-dependent reduction of horse heart cyt c (Fig. 2C). pYO38/YO2, pYO33/YO2, and pYO30/YO2 harboring cyt bc1-cy fusion complexes with different lengths of cyt cy linkers showed very similar levels of DBH2: cyt c reductase activities as compared with that of the pMTS1/MT-RBC1 overproducing a native cyt bc1 complex. Therefore, neither fusing cyt cy to cyt c1, nor changing the length of the cyt cy linker region significantly affected the cyt bc1 complex enzymatic activity of various cyt bc1-cy fusion complexes with different cyt cy linker lengths. The presence of b-type cyts and cyts c to b ratios for all strains were also determined using optical difference spectroscopy to assess the relative amounts of the cyt bc1 complexes. Changes in the amounts of the c-type (α peakmax at 551 nm, ϵ551-542 of 20 mm-1 cm-1) and b-type (α peakmax at 560 nm, ϵ560-574 of 28 mm-1 cm-1) cytochromes were monitored after reduction by ascorbate and dithionite, respectively, of ferricyanide-oxidized chromatophore membranes from appropriate strains (Fig. 3). Strains pMTS1/MT-RBC1 and MT-G4/S4 exhibited cyt c to b ratios of ∼1:2, whereas very small amounts of c or b peaks were detected in YO2. On the other hand, strains pYO38/YO2, pYO33/YO2, and pYO30/YO2 had similar amounts of b-type cytochromes with cyt c to b ratios of about 1:1 (Fig. 3). The data indicated that all strains contained similar amounts of cyt bc1-cy fusion complexes regardless of the linker length of their cyt cy. Furthermore, to confirm that the Fe-S subunits of fusion complexes had native-like physicochemical properties, EPR spectroscopy was used. Chromatophore membranes prepared from pYO38/YO2 exhibited the [2Fe-2S] cluster gy and gx signals of 1.891 and 1.806, respectively, which were identical to those seen with a native cyt bc1 complex (e.g. MT-G4/S4) (Fig. 4A). Moreover, under appropriate conditions, the EPR signals with gz values of 3.778 and 3.411 assigned to cyts bL and bH, respectively, were observed with the same membrane preparations (Fig. 4B). The overall data established that all cyt bc1-cy fusion complexes assembled similarly, and exhibited similar enzymatic activities, indicating that the slower growth rates observed with pYO33/YO2 and pYO30/YO2 could not be correlated with the amounts of fusion complexes.

Xa and the native form are stable, inter-convertible species whose relative populations at equilibrium appear displaced in disease-linked mutants toward the scrambled form.

Loss-of-function mutations in the LDLR gene cause familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disorder affecting ∼1 in 500 individuals worldwide (3Hobbs H.H. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). There are over 1000 mutations believed to cause FH, including numerous insertions, deletions, and point mutations. In heterozygotes, FH results in elevated concentrations of LDL and cholesterol in blood and therefore in an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Homozygotes develop severe atherosclerosis at a very early age, which leads to death. The mature LDLR is a single-pass transmembrane, multidomain glycoprotein of 839 residues that comprises seven different regions (see Fig. 1): seven tandem LDLR type A (LA) modules at the N terminus responsible for binding of lipoproteins, two epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats, a YWTD domain, another EGF-like repeat, an O-linked glycosylation region, a transmembrane segment, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (4Gent J.

The LA modules contain ∼40 residues that are cross-linked by three disulfide bridges with the following connectivity: C1–C3, C2–C5, and C4–C6 (Fig. 1). The solution structures of LA1, LA2, and LA6 together with the crystal structure of LA5 reveal a low content of secondary structure: a short β-hairpin and two 310 helices (7Daly N.L. Djordjevic J.T.

According to the crystal, the LA5 structure is organized around a calcium ion coordinated through the side chains of residues Asp-25, Asp-29, Asp-35, and Glu-36 and the backbone carbonyls of Trp-22 and Gly-27. The structural analysis of LA5 also allows the classification of FH mutations in two categories: elimination or misplacement of direct Ca2+ ligands (W22X, G27D, D29X, D35E, E36X), and removal of hydrogen or disulfide bonds that disrupt the backbone topology (C5X, C12Y, C30X, C39X, E16K, D32X, S34X) (9Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The LDLR is an outstanding example of multidomain protein for which the in vivo folding seems to take place non-vectorially in a posttranslational manner (11Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and whose LA modules have been shown to fold independently (12North C.L. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13127-13135Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Flexible linker regions connecting the individual modules allow the ligand binding repeats of the receptor to adjust their relative position in order to bind a variety of heterogeneous LDL particles of different shape and diameter (13Beglova N. North C.L. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2808-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14North C.L. Blacklow S.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3926-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Several studies have been focused on the influence of FH mutations on the conformation of the LA5 domain. The abundant mutations that affect the calcium binding motif of this module have been shown to prevent, in many cases, the attainment of a native structure leading to misfolding of the domain and disease (15Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Despite all this information, little is known about the folding landscape of individual LA modules from the reduced/unfolded ensemble to the native state, the influence of calcium in shaping it, or the precise effect of FH mutations on the LA folding pathway. Oxidative folding and reductive unfolding studies of small, disulfiderich proteins have emerged in the last several years as useful tools to understand the concomitant relationship between protein folding and disulfide bond formation (16Creighton T.E. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 731-744PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wedemeyer W.J. Welker E. Narayan M. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4207-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The success of these experiments relies on the capture of folding intermediates by disulfide acid trapping, the subsequent isolation of generated species by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and their final molecular characterization (18Arolas J.L.

The present work reports a detailed analysis of the oxidative folding and reductive unfolding pathways of LA5 at different pH and redox conditions. The role of the different intermediates that arise along the folding process is elucidated by kinetic and structural analyses to provide insights into the folding landscape of LA modules. In addition to that of wild type, the oxidative folding of five LA5 mutants (S14A, E16K, D29G, D32A, and D35E) related with FH is investigated in order to understand better the molecular basis accounting for the impossibility of some variants achieving a stable native-like conformation, thus leading to misfolding and disease. Expression and Purification of LA5—The cDNA encoding for human LA5 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGEX-4T-3 vector (GE Healthcare), allowing the expression of recombinant LA5 as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Typically, 10 liters of culture were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani medium until an A600 of 0.6 and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration) at 18 °C. The soluble fusion protein was extracted from the cell pellet by sonication in an ice bath, purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare), and subsequently cleaved with bovine thrombin (Sigma) to release the LA5 module (10 units of thrombin/1 mg of glutathione S-transferase-LA5). The thrombin cleavage site resulted in the modification of the first amino acid of LA5 (D1G). After cleavage, the protein was refolded under conditions permitting disulfide exchange by exhaustive dialysis at 4 °C against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm cystine, and 2 mm cysteine. The resulting LA5 was purified to homogeneity by RP-HPLC on a preparative C4 column (Vydac Grace) using a linear 15–35% gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile over 50 min with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The protein was kept in lyophilized aliquots. The purity and identity of LA5 were determined, respectively, by SDS-PAGE gel stained with silver and MALDI-TOF MS. A theoretical extinction coefficient at 280 nm (ϵ280 = 6050 m–1cm–1) was used to calculate the concentration of LA5. Mutagenesis and Expression of LA5 Variants—The five mutants designed for the present work (S14A, E16K, D29G, D32A, and D35E) were generated using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions of the manufacturer and verified by DNA sequencing. The expression and purification of the mutants were performed as described under “Expression and Purification of LA5” for the wild type (WT) form. Oxidative Folding of WT and Mutant LA5—Native LA5 variants (2 mg) were reduced and denatured in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, containing 8 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and 150 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at 23 °C for at least 2 h. To initiate folding, the sample was passed through a PD-10 column (Sephadex-25; GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3 or 8.4, including 0.1 mm EDTA or 10 mm CaCl2 for experiments with the absence (apo) or presence (holo) of calcium, respectively. The protein was recovered in 1.2 ml and immediately diluted to a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in the same buffer, both in the absence (Control–) and presence of redox agents: 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Control+), 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione (GSSG), or 0.5 mm/1 mm oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSSG/GSH). For some experiments, selected concentrations of denaturants (1–2 m urea, 0.5–4 m GdnHCl, or 4 m guanidine thiocyanate (GdnSCN)), NaCl (0.1 m) or protein disulfide isomerase (Sigma) (2 μm) were added to the reaction. To monitor the folding reaction, aliquots were removed in a time course manner, trapped by acidification with 4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by RP-HPLC as follows. A linear 15–35% gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile was applied during 50 min into a 4.6-mm Jupiter C4 column (Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. Alternatively, folding intermediates were trapped by derivatization with 0.1 m 2-aminoethylmethylthiosulfonate (AEMTS; Anatrace) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, at 23 °C for 15 min, further diluted in 10 volumes of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by MS as described under “Mass Spectrometry and One-dimensional NMR Spectroscopy.” Selected fractions of intermediates were purified by RP-HPLC and lyophilized before alkylation with AEMTS. Stop/Go Folding of the Major LA5 Scrambled Isomer—Acid-trapped Xa scrambled isomer was isolated by RP-HPLC as described under “Oxidative Folding of WT and Mutant LA5,” freeze-dried, and allowed to re-initiate the folding at 23 °C by dissolving the sample (0.5 mg/ml) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, both in the absence (Control–) and presence (Control+) of 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol with and without 10 mm CaCl2. For apo-Ca2+ experiments, 0.1 mm EDTA was added to the reaction. Folding intermediates were similarly trapped by acidification and analyzed by RP-HPLC. Reductive Unfolding of WT LA5—Native LA5 (0.5 mg/ml) was dissolved at 23 °C in either 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, or 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing different concentrations (0.5–200 mm) of DTT or Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP; Sigma), respectively. The reaction mixtures also included the presence of 0.1 mm EDTA or 10 mm CaCl2. To monitor the refolding reaction, aliquots were removed at various time intervals, quenched with 4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by RP-HPLC as detailed under “Oxidative Folding of WT and Mutant LA5.” Disulfide Scrambling of WT LA5—Native LA5 was dissolved to a final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, containing 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol as thiol initiator, different concentrations of denaturants (0–8 m urea, 0–8 m GdnHCl, or 0–6 m GdnSCN), and either 0.1 mm EDTA or 10 mm CaCl2. The reaction was allowed to reach equilibrium for 20 h at 25, 50, 70, and 90 °C. The samples were then quenched by acidification and analyzed by RP-HPLC as detailed in previous sections. Mass Spectrometry and One-dimensional NMR Spectroscopy—The molecular masses of LA5 variants and AEMTS-derivatized intermediates (+76 Da for each free cysteine) were determined by MALDI-TOF MS using a Bruker Ultraflex spectrometer operating in linear mode geometry under 20 kV. Samples were prepared by mixing equal volumes of the protein and matrix solutions (10 mg/ml of 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone (Sigma) dissolved in 30% acetonitrile containing 20 mm ammonium citrate, pH 5.5), and 0.5 μl of the mixture were spotted on the MALDI plate. A mixture of proteins from Bruker (protein calibration standard I; mass range of 3000 to 25000 Da) was used as mass calibration standard. For mono-dimensional NMR experiments, lyophilized proteins were dissolved to a final concentration of 1 mm in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, containing H2O/D2O (9:1 ratio by volume) or 99.9% D2O and 0.1 mm EDTA or 10 mm CaCl2. NMR spectra were acquired at different temperatures (25–90 °C) on a Bruker AVANCE 600-MHz spectrometer using solvent suppression WATERGATE techniques. The collected spectra were processed and analyzed using the TopSpinv1.3 software packages from Bruker Biospin. Oxidative Folding of LA5—Oxidative folding of fully reduced and denatured LA5 (R) was carried out in Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.4 both in the absence (Control–) and presence of selected redox agents, namely, 2-mercaptoethanol (Control+), GSSG, or a mixture of GSSG and GSH. The intermediates that arise along the folding reaction were trapped by acidification with trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed in a time course manner by RP-HPLC as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” A high number of intermediates populate the early stages of the refolding process (up to 24 h) with almost identical RP-HPLC profiles regardless of the presence of thiol catalyst (see Fig. 2a). However, the addition of an oxidizing agent (GSSG) strongly accelerates the folding rates, leading to equilibrium in less than 4 h and without significantly altering the overall chromatographic pattern (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, after 72 h all of the four reaction conditions where calcium was not present reached the same equilibrium, with an outstanding accumulation of a fraction hereafter named Xa. To verify the effect of calcium over the folding of LA5, its oxidative folding was repeated including an excess of CaCl2 in the reaction (Fig. 2, a and b). The presence of calcium significantly accelerates the formation of intermediates with chromatographic profiles that resemble those obtained previously in the absence of this ion. Only at the final stages of folding (8–24 h) is the RP-HPLC pattern altered with a small occurrence of Xa and an absolute predominance of the native form (N) (see below). Again, the presence of GSSG strongly increases the rate of folding, while the addition of thiol catalyst, either 2-mercaptoethanol or GSH, slightly accelerates the reaction.FIGURE 2Oxidative folding of LA5. a, RP-HPLC traces of the acid-trapped intermediates that accumulate along the oxidative folding of LA5. The reactions were carried out in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, in the absence (Control–) and presence (Control+) of 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol as thiol catalyst (see “Experimental Procedures”). The experiments were conducted in parallel in the absence and presence of 10 mm CaCl2. N and R indicate the elution positions of the native and fully reduced/denatured forms of LA5, respectively. Xa stands for a major 3-disulfide scrambled isomer. 1S, 2S, and 3S are ensembles of molecules with the corresponding number of disulfide bonds. b, RP-HPLC traces of the folding reactions performed in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, containing either 0.5 mm GSSG or 0.5 mm/1 mm GSSG/GSH in the absence and presence of 10 mm CaCl2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Samples of the different refolding reactions were quenched at selected time points by alkylation of thiol groups with AEMTS (22Iwaoka M. Juminaga D. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4490-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and subsequently analyzed by MS to evaluate the disulfide bond content of the intermediates (supplemental Fig. S1). The disulfide bond nature of the different fractions of intermediates arising along the folding reaction was also precisely determined by RP-HPLC purification, derivatization with AEMTS, and final MS analysis (supplemental Fig. S2). The results show a progressive accumulation of 1- and 2-disulfide species (1S and 2S ensemble) that finally leads to the formation of the 3S ensemble. The absence of calcium precludes the acquisition of N and therefore leads to the complete accumulation of non-native 3-disulfide (scrambled) forms, with Xa representing up to 50% of the total protein in Control– and Control+ and more than 65% in the oxidizing conditions. By contrast, in the presence of calcium the amount of 3-disulfide species detected by MS approximates that of native protein (N) found by RP-HPLC, with a recovery of more than 95% of N after 36 h in Control– and Control+ and after 3 h in the conditions with GSSG. The low amount of scrambled isomers occurring at the same time as N (see 8 h in Fig. 2a) suggests a direct formation of native LA5 from the 2S ensemble probably caused by the action of Ca2+. This is further confirmed by the minor effect of GSH compared with the reactions including GSSG. Evolution of Scrambled Isomers in the Oxidative Folding of LA5—To assess the importance of the 3S population in the oxidative folding of LA5, the predominant species Xa was isolated by RP-HPLC and allowed to resume its folding in Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.4 both in the absence and presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and calcium (Fig. 3). As could be expected from the results reported under “Oxidative Folding of LA5,” the absence of calcium completely precludes the formation of native form, even in the presence of thiol catalyst, which allows the rearrangement of the Xa disulfide bonds and gives rise to equilibrium with other scrambled isomers already observed during the oxidative folding reactions. The same result is obtained in the presence of calcium and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. However, the simultaneous presence of both compounds allows the disulfide reshuffling of Xa to other 3-disulfide species and the subsequent attainment of the native conformation. Oxidative Folding of LA5 under Physiological and Denaturing Conditions—To mimic the conditions inside the cell, the oxidative folding pathway of LA5 was also investigated at pH 7.3 in the presence of selected concentrations of NaCl and of the protein folding catalyst, protein disulfide isomerase. Because reactions without calcium are unable to render the native form, these experiments were always performed in the presence of CaCl2. Lowering the pH from 8.4 to 7.3 significantly increased the folding rate at the first stages of the process (Control– and Control+ in supplemental Fig. S3a compared with Fig. 2a) by reducing the rearrangement degree of 1- and 2-disulfide intermediates that initially funnels the folding reaction. The addition of physiological concentrations of NaCl also favors the rate of formation of disulfide intermediates, possibly by competing with non-native ionic interactions and/or by reducing electrostatic repulsions, but at the same time it seems to stabilize the Xa species, which strongly accumulates in the absence of reducing agent (supplemental Fig. S3a). In the absence of redox agents, protein disulfide isomerase is unable to function properly and the rate and efficiency of the folding reaction diminishes. This is circumvented by the addition of selected concentrations of GSSG and GSH, which promote the action of this enzyme, leading to an improved folding reaction (supplemental Fig. S3b). However, in contrast to its dramatic effect on the folding kinetics of other disulfide-rich proteins (23Arolas J.L. Bronsoms S. Ventura S. Aviles F.X. Calvete J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22906-22916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24van den Berg B. Chung E.W. Robinson C.V. Mateo P.L. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4794-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), its influence here is rather moderate due to the calcium-promoted strong bias toward the native linkage making protein disulfide isomerase-catalyzed reshuffling reactions difficult. Wild type LA5 was also refolded at pH 8.4 in the presence of selected concentrations of denaturant and calcium to investigate the role of non-covalent contacts on its oxidative folding. As in the folding carried out in the presence of NaCl, mild denaturing conditions (e.g. 1 m urea or 0.5 m GdnHCl) strongly accelerate the initial stages of the folding reaction (supplemental Fig. S4). This effect may be exerted thorough destabilization of non-native interactions that may hamper the adoption of the native conformation. Similarly, the presence of elevated concentrations of denaturant strongly accelerates the first steps of folding but negatively affects the final attainment of the native state by stabilizing the scrambled population. Actually, the condition including 4 m GdnSCN closely resembles the folding of the mutants that are unable to reach a native-like conformation (see next paragraph). Oxidative Folding of LA5 Mutants—Five mutants affecting either a hydrogen-bonding network that holds the two lobes of the module together (S14A, E16K, and D32A) or the calcium binding motif (D29G and D35E) of LA5 were constructed and characterized in terms of oxidative folding. The folding experiments were always conducted at physiological pH in the presence of calcium excess. In the absence of redox agents (Control–), the RP-HPLC profiles of the five mutants are similar at the initial stages of the folding process, resembling those of the wild type form (Fig. 4). As in the case of the WT LA5, the addition of thiol catalyst (Control+) only accelerates the final stages of folding, whereas the presence of oxidizing agent strongly increases the rate of the overall folding process. Among the five mutants, S14A, E16K, and D29G seem to attain a native-like conformation (designated as N*). However, their folding reactions display a very low efficiency compared with the wild type, indicated by the fact that less than 60% of the protein is recovered as N* after 96 h of reaction (see Control+ in Fig. 4). The rest of the protein remains trapped as a mixture of scrambled isomers that need the presence of redox agents to reshuffle their disulfide bonds and reach the native-like state (see supplemental Fig. S5). Altogether, the folding of D32A and D35E resembles that of wild type LA5 performed in the absence of calcium. None of these mutants folds into a predominant native-like conformation, even in the presence of GSSG/GSH (supplemental Fig. S5). The protein remains frozen in a mixture of scrambled isomers that mainly occur in one RP-HPLC fraction reminiscent of Xa (termed Xa*). Interestingly, excepting S14A, the other mutants show an increased folding rate at the beginning of the reaction as compared with that of the WT form. Reductive Unfolding of LA5—Reductive unfolding of native LA5 (N) was examined in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4, and acetate buffer, pH 4.5, using DTT and TCEP, respectively, as reducing agents (25Chang J.Y. Li L. Bulychev A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8287-8289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26English B.P. Welker E. Narayan M. Scheraga H.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 4995-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The intermediates that arose along the unfolding reaction were trapped by acidification at various time points and subsequently analyzed by RP-HPLC. Low concentrations of DTT (0.5–1 mm) were able to reduce the native protein into a mixture of 2- and 1-disulfide species with chromatographic elution time equivalent to those of the intermediates occurring during oxidative folding (Fig. 5a). A minor accumulation of Xa was also observed due to the disulfide reshuffling that takes place at the working pH. In the presence of calcium, LA5 undergoes an almost all-or-none mechanism of unfolding with a very low accumulation of intermediates. In addition, the amount of DTT needed to break the disulfide bonds of this protein increases enormously (>100 times) upon coordination of the calcium ion to LA5. The use of TCEP as reductant (pH 4.5) completely alters the pattern of intermediates owing to the prevalence of reductive reactions over disulfide reshuffling. The minor intermediates occurring during folding and unfolding at pH 8.4 accumulate now to a much greater extent (see supplemental Fig. S2) with similar RP-HPLC profiles observed in the absence and presence of calcium (Fig. 5b). Unlike with the use of DTT, the degree of accumulation of intermediates increases notably with the addition of calcium. Again, the presence of this ion strongly increases the amount of TCEP required to reduce the native protein: ∼10 times versus the 100 times needed in the case of DTT. This difference could be explained by the lower affinity for calcium of LA5 at acid pH (27Simonovic M. Dolmer K. Huang W. Strickland D.K. Volz K. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15127-15134Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the presence of calcium also increases the accumulation of a 2S fraction eluting close to N.

https://openalex.org/W1964730642,"We previously found that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) negatively regulates alcohol drinking (He, D.

Several studies suggest a role for GDNF in the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels in the midbrain (Georgievska, B., Kirik, D., and Bjorklund, A. (2004) J. Neurosci. 24, 6437–6445). Up-regulation of TH levels has been reported as a hallmark of biochemical adaptations to in vivo chronic exposure to drugs of abuse, including ethanol (Ortiz, J., Fitzgerald, L. W., Charlton, M., Lane, S., Trevisan, L., Guitart, X., Shoemaker, W., Duman, R. S., and Nestler, E. J. (1995) Synapse 21, 289–298). We hypothesized that GDNF plays an important role in regulating prolonged ethanol-mediated increases in TH protein levels. Using the SH-SY5Y dopaminergic-like cell line, we found that the increase in TH levels in the presence of ethanol required the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway and was reversed by GDNF. Ethanol treatment did not alter the mRNA level or protein translation of TH, but enhanced the stability of the protein that was decreased by GDNF. Interestingly, we observed that ethanol treatment resulted in an increase in TH association with the chaperone heat shock protein (HSP90) that was mediated by the cAMP/PKA pathway and inhibited by GDNF. Taken together, these data suggest that prolonged ethanol exposure leads to increased association of TH and HSP90 via the cAMP/PKA pathway, resulting in the stabilization and subsequent accumulation of TH. GDNF reverses this ethanol-mediated adaptation by inhibiting the interaction of TH with HSP90. We previously found that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) negatively regulates alcohol drinking (He, D. Y., McGough, N.

Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 463-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 9Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2439-2450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Koob G.F. Trends Pharmacol.

One of the most consistent adaptations to long-term exposure to drugs of abuse and ethanol is the up-regulation of TH protein levels in the VTA (2Messer C.J. Eisch A.J. Carlezon Jr., W.A. Whisler K.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore set out to identify the molecular mechanism by which prolonged exposure to ethanol leads to an increase in TH immunoreactivity. Several studies suggest a role for the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the regulation of TH levels in the midbrain. For example, GDNF overexpression by lentiviral delivery in the striatum reduced mRNA and/or protein levels of TH in the substantia nigra (SN) (3Georgievska B. Kirik D. Bjorklund A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6437-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 4Rosenblad C. Georgievska B. Kirik D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the VTA (4Rosenblad C. Georgievska B. Kirik D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This increase in GDNF leads to a decrease in TH enzyme activity and dopamine levels in the striatum (16Sajadi A. Bauer M. Thony B. Aebischer P. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, infusion of GDNF into the VTA reverses chronic cocaine- or morphine-increased TH protein levels in this brain region (2Messer C.J. Eisch A.J. Carlezon Jr., W.A. Whisler K. Shen L. Wolf D.H. Westphal H. Collins F. Russell D.S. Nestler E.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). GDNF is a distant member of the transforming growth factor β superfamily, originally isolated from the rat B49 glial cell line (17Lin L.F. Doherty D.H. Lile J.D. Bektesh S. Collins F. Science. 1993; 260: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2815) Google Scholar). GDNF has been shown to promote the survival of adult midbrain dopaminergic neurons after injury (17Lin L.F. Doherty D.H.

For example, repeated injections of GDNF adjacent to the SN prevented axotomy-induced loss of TH-expressing neurons in that brain region (18Beck K.D. Valverde J. Alexi T. Poulsen K. Moffat B. Vandlen R.A. Rosenthal A. Hefti F. Nature. 1995; 373: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) and adenoviral delivery of GDNF into the SN protected against degeneration of dopamine neurons following injection of 6-hydroxydopamine in the striatum (20Choi-Lundberg D.L.

Science. 2000; 290: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) of GDNF into the SN and striatum protected against nigrostriatal degeneration induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which is toxic to dopaminergic neurons. GDNF selectively protects dopaminergic neurons, as compared with serotonergic neurons, against the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine (22Cass W.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 8132-8139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, GDNF has been shown to regulate behavioral responses to drugs of abuse such as cocaine, morphine, and ethanol (1He D.Y.

For example, GDNF heterozygous (+/–) mice display increased responsiveness to the rewarding effects of cocaine and increased locomotor activity after repeated exposure to cocaine or morphine as compared with their wild-type littermates (2Messer C.J. Eisch A.J. Carlezon Jr., W.A. Whisler K. Shen L. Wolf D.H. Westphal H. Collins F. Russell D.S. Nestler E.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Messer et al. further reported that infusion of GDNF into the VTA, where GDNF-mediated signaling was decreased after chronic exposure to cocaine or morphine, reduced the rewarding effects of cocaine in rats (2Messer C.J. Eisch A.J. Carlezon Jr., W.A. Whisler K. Shen L. Wolf D.H. Westphal H. Collins F. Russell D.S. Nestler E.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We recently found that the expression of GDNF is highly up-regulated in vitro and in vivo in the midbrain region containing the VTA following administration of ibogaine, a psychoactive indole alkaloid extracted from the root bark of the African shrub Tabernanthe Iboga (1He D.Y.

Ibogaine is reported to reverse phenotypes associated with addiction to multiple drugs of abuse, including alcohol, in humans (24Popik P. Layer R.T. Skolnick P. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 235-253PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mash D.C. Kovera C.A. Buck B.E. Norenberg M.D. Shapshak P. Hearn W.L. Sanchez-Ramos J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 844: 274-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and various studies including ours also suggest that ibogaine attenuates drug- and ethanol-mediated behaviors in rodents (1He D.Y. McGough N.N. Ravindranathan A. Jeanblanc J. Logrip M.L. Phamluong K. Janak P.H. Ron D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Cappendijk S.L. Dzoljic M.R. Eur J.

We identified GDNF in the VTA as the mediator of the ability of ibogaine to decrease ethanol consumption as inhibition of GDNF signaling in the VTA by delivery of anti-GDNF neutralizing antibodies attenuated the action of ibogaine to decrease ethanol intake (1He D.Y. McGough N.N. Ravindranathan A. Jeanblanc J. Logrip M.L. Phamluong K. Janak P.H. Ron D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Additionally, we showed that increasing GDNF levels in the VTA by direct injection of the growth factor reduced rat operant self-administration of ethanol (1He D.Y. McGough N.N. Ravindranathan A. Jeanblanc J. Logrip M.L. Phamluong K. Janak P.H. Ron D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Together these results suggest that GDNF negatively controls responses to exposure to drugs of abuse and ethanol via its actions in the VTA. We therefore hypothesized that down-regulation of TH levels by GDNF may underlie its ability to negatively regulate adaptations to ethanol exposure. To address these questions, we used dopaminergic-like SH-SY5Y cells (29Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar), which express GDNF and its receptors (1He D.Y. McGough N.N. Ravindranathan A. Jeanblanc J. Logrip M.L. Phamluong K. Janak P.H. Ron D. J.

Faseb J. 2006; 20: 2420-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), as a cell culture model and investigated the molecular mechanisms mediating the increase in TH levels by ethanol to determine whether and how GDNF alters ethanol action.

Primers for PCR were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys. Cell Culture—SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were cultured in the growth medium Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) plus 1× MEM non-essential amino acid solution (Invitrogen). All experiments were carried out in cells that had been incubated in a low serum medium containing 1% FBS for 2 days. GDNF stable cells overexpressing GDNF were derived from SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with pUSE-GDNF and control cells were obtained by stable transfection with the pUSE empty vector (30He D.Y. Ron D. Faseb J. 2006; 20: 2420-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The stable cell lines were maintained in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 and incubated in low serum medium for 2 days prior to experiments. Treatments—Cells were treated with ethanol for 12–48 h in low serum medium by replacing the medium with ethanol every 12 h. GDNF or ibogaine was added to the medium for the last 12 h of 24-h treatments with ethanol, and the inhibitors GA, Bis, PP2, H89, and Rp-cAMPS were added for the last 9 h of the 24-h ethanol treatment. PI-PLC was incubated with cells at a concentration of 0.3 units/ml for 1 h as described previously (1He D.Y. McGough N.N. Ravindranathan A. Jeanblanc J. Logrip M.L. Phamluong K. Janak P.H. Ron D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Anti-GDNF neutralizing antibodies were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and were used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA isolation was carried out using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA samples were analyzed by RT-PCR with actin as an internal control as described previously (1He D.Y. McGough N.N. Ravindranathan A. Jeanblanc J. Logrip M.L. Phamluong K. Janak P.H. Ron D. J.

After the RT reaction, PCR was run for 32 cycles with the TH primers as follows: upstream 5′-TTC GCG CAG TTC TCG CAG GAC ATT GGC-3′ and downstream 5′-CGT GTA CGG GTC GAA CTT CAC GGA GAA-3′. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were collected and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer plus protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures for Western blot and immunoprecipitated as previously described (1He D.Y. McGough N.N. Ravindranathan A. Jeanblanc J. Logrip M.L. Phamluong K. Janak P.H. Ron D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30He D.Y. Ron D. Faseb J. 2006; 20: 2420-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of each homogenate was subjected to an SDS-PAGE gel and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis with anti-TH antibody or other primary antibodies, followed by reprobing with anti-actin antibody. Alternatively, 500 μg of each homogenate was incubated with 5 μg of anti-TH, anti-HSP90 or anti-Akt antibodies in TBS-T buffer overnight at 4 °C, followed by a 2-h incubation with protein G-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel for Western blot analysis. Pulse-chase Analysis—After 24 h of ethanol treatment, cells were labeled following a pulse-chase procedure as described previously (31Ronca F. Yee K.S. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18128-18134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cells were incubated with methionine/cystine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 1% dialyzed FBS for 1 h and then labeled in the Met/Cys-free medium containing 25 μCi of Amersham Biosciences Redivue Pro-Mix l-[35S] in vitro Cell Labeling Mix per ml for 3 h. Dialysis of FBS was performed against the Met/Cys-free medium overnight. After labeling, cells were washed twice with the normal medium and chased in the normal medium without ethanol for 2–8 h before homogenizing as described above. Homogenates were centrifuged, and protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined. An equal amount of protein from each sample was immunoprecipitated with anti-TH antibody and separated by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS gel. Autoradiography was performed by exposure of the dried gels to Amersham Biosciences Storage Phosphor Screen and visualization of radioactive signals using the Typhoon 9410 Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare). Quantification and Statistical Analysis—Signals from Western blot, RT-PCR, or 35S-labeled radioactivity images were quantified using NIH Image 1.61 as described previously (1He D.Y. McGough N.N. Ravindranathan A. Jeanblanc J. Logrip M.L. Phamluong K. Janak P.H. Ron D. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 30He D.Y. Ron D. Faseb J. 2006; 20: 2420-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The density of TH immunoreactivity was used to estimate TH protein levels that were expressed as ratios to those of actin. TH mRNA levels were expressed as ratios to those of actin. In the pulse-chase analysis, percentage of the radioactive signals of 35S-labeled TH during the chase times was used to estimate relative stability of the protein. Results were obtained from at least three separate experiments, and the statistical significance of differences between treatments and control was analyzed using a one-sample t test (GraphPad). Tyrosine Hydroxylase Immunoreactivity Is Up-regulated upon Prolonged Exposure of Cells to Ethanol—We first tested whether the chronic ethanol-mediated increase in TH immunoreactivity could be mimicked in the dopaminergic-like SH-SY5Y cells. We found that prolonged ethanol treatment resulted in an increase in TH protein levels after 24 and 48 h of exposure to ethanol (Fig. 1A). The increase in TH protein levels by ethanol occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, even 10 mm, a low, non-intoxicating dose of ethanol, produced a significant increase in the immunoreactivity of TH. Finally, the ethanol-induced increase in TH protein levels was long-lasting and could be detected 24 h after ethanol washout (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the increase in TH levels is a long-lasting adaptation to ethanol exposure, which can be detected in SH-SY5Y cells. Cyclic AMP-dependent Protein Kinase A (PKA) Is Required for Ethanol Induction of TH Protein Levels—Next, we set out to identify the mechanism underlying the action of ethanol on TH protein levels. Because it is well-established that several signaling pathways are altered in response to ethanol, including those mediated by protein kinase A (PKA), Fyn, and protein kinase C (PKC) (32Mailliard W.S. Diamond I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 101: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Ron D. Jurd R. Sci STKE. 2005; 2005: re14PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that kinase-mediated signaling pathways may be required for ethanol to increase TH protein levels by using inhibitors of these kinases in conjunction with chronic ethanol treatment. Application of Bis, an inhibitor of PKC, or PP2, an inhibitor of Fyn kinase, did not, while both Rp-cAMPS, an inhibitor of cAMP, and H89, an inhibitor of PKA, did block the ability of ethanol to increase TH protein levels (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that the cAMP/PKA pathway is required for the increase of TH in response to ethanol. PKA has been reported to phosphorylate TH (34Dunkley P.R. Bobrovskaya L. Graham M.E. von Nagy-Felsobuki E.I. Dickson P.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1025-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether PKA-mediated TH phosphorylation can be detected after ethanol treatment using anti-phospho(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate antibody. This phosphospecific antibody has been used to demonstrate the phosphorylation of PKA substrates (for examples see Refs. 35Lei H. Venkatakrishnan A. Yu S. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9364-9371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36Vanhoose A.M. Clements J.M. Winder D.G. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, we found that exposure of cells to ethanol resulted in an increase in PKA-mediated phosphorylation of TH, which was inhibited in the presence of H89. This phosphorylation was further confirmed using anti-phospho(Ser-40)TH antibodies as shown in Fig. 2C. These results suggest that ethanol treatment increases PKA-mediated phosphorylation of TH at Ser-40, which is required for up-regulation of TH protein levels by ethanol. Prolonged Exposure of Cells to Ethanol Enhances the Stability of TH Protein—Next, we tested whether prolonged ethanol exposure induces an increase in TH mRNA levels or synthesis of the protein. We found that prolonged incubation with ethanol did not increase TH mRNA (Fig. 3A). In addition, CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor, did not inhibit ethanol-mediated increases in TH protein levels (Fig. 3B). Curiously, an increase in TH protein levels was detected after long-term CHX treatment, which could be due to the inhibition of synthesis of protein components of the proteosome machinery. Nonetheless, our results suggest that ethanol exposure enhances the stability of the TH protein, resulting in its accumulation, rather than increasing transcription of the TH gene or translation of the protein. To test the possibility that prolonged exposure of cells to ethanol leads to the stabilization of the TH protein, we performed a pulse-chase analysis. After 24 h of ethanol treatment, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased in normal medium without ethanol. Results from autoradiography of 35S-labeled TH protein revealed an increase in the quantity of labeled TH protein after ethanol treatment at all points in the chase time course, compared with control (Fig. 3C). The increase in labeled TH protein amounts detected in the pulsechase analysis is relatively low compared with the increase in protein levels detected by Western blot analysis. This might be due to limitations of the pulse-chase procedure. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the ethanol treatment enhances the stability of the protein. Prolonged Ethanol Exposure Enhances TH Protein Stability via Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP90)—To elucidate the mechanism by which ethanol increases TH protein stability, we tested whether HSP90 contributes to the ethanol-mediated increase in TH immunoreactivity. HSP90 is a molecular chaperone that has extensively been shown to promote the stability and function of many signaling proteins (37Zhang H. Burrows F. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Specifically, HSP90 enhances the stability of proteins by forming an ATP-dependent complex with proteins such as steroid receptors, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), Her-2, Akt, Raf-1 kinase, p53, and cdk4, protecting them from proteasome-dependent degradation (37Zhang H. Burrows F. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 38Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 271-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Disruption of the complex of HSP90 with these proteins by HSP90 inhibitors, such as GA, leads to protein degradation (37Zhang H. Burrows F. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 488-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 39Xiao L. Rasouli P. Ruden D.M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2007; 14: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 40Hadden M.K.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). GA specifically inhibits the HSP90 molecular chaperone (42Whitesell L. Cook P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 43Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) by binding to the ATP-binding site in the chaperone (44Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 45Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.J.

We hypothesized that if HSP90 activity contributes to ethanol-induced increases in TH protein levels, GA should block the action of ethanol. As shown in Fig. 4A, application of GA dose-dependently inhibited the ethanol-mediated increase in TH immunoreactivity. We further found that treatment with ethanol alone, or together with GA, did not alter the protein level of HSP90 (Fig. 4B). This suggests that the increase in TH protein levels by ethanol treatment is not due to an alteration of HSP90 protein levels, and that GA treatment specifically inhibits ethanol induction of TH protein levels. To further test whether HSP90 participates in maintaining TH stability upon ethanol treatment, we measured the possible association of TH and HSP90 in untreated and ethanol-treated cells by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-TH or anti-HSP90 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, ethanol treatment for 24 h induced an association of TH with HSP90, and this association was blocked in the presence of GA. This effect of ethanol is specific for the association between TH and HSP90 because the ethanol treatment did not alter the association between Akt ki"
https://openalex.org/W2090890648,"Photosynthetic (Ps) electron transport pathways often contain multiple electron carriers with overlapping functions. Here we focus on two c-type cytochromes (cyt) in facultative phototrophic bacteria of the Rhodobacter genus: the diffusible cyt c2 and the membrane-anchored cyt cy. In species like R. capsulatus, cyt cy functions in both Ps and respiratory electron transport chains, whereas in other species like R. sphaeroides, it does so only in respiration. The molecular bases of this difference was investigated by producing a soluble variant of cyt cy (S-cy), by fusing genetically the cyt c2 signal sequence to the cyt c domain of cyt cy. This novel electron carrier was unable to support the Ps growth of R. capsulatus. However, strains harboring cyt S-cy regained Ps growth ability by acquiring mutations in its cyt c domain. They produced cyt S-cy variants at amounts comparable with that of cyt c2, and conferred Ps growth. Chemical titration indicated that the redox midpoint potential of cyt S-cy was about 340 mV, similar to that of cyts c2 or cy. Remarkably, electron transfer kinetics from the cyt bc1 complex to the photochemical reaction center (RC) mediated by cyt S-cy was distinct from those seen with the cyt c2 or cyt cy. The kinetics exhibited a pronounced slow phase, suggesting that cyt S-cy interacted with the RC less tightly than cyt c2. Comparison of structural models of cyts c2 and S-cy revealed that several of the amino acid residues implicated in long-range electrostatic interactions promoting binding of cyt c2 to the RC are not conserved in cyt cy, whereas those supporting short-range hydrophobic interactions are conserved. These findings indicated that attaching electron carrier cytochromes to the membrane allowed them to weaken their interactions with their partners so that they could accommodate more rapid multiple turnovers. Photosynthetic (Ps) electron transport pathways often contain multiple electron carriers with overlapping functions. Here we focus on two c-type cytochromes (cyt) in facultative phototrophic bacteria of the Rhodobacter genus: the diffusible cyt c2 and the membrane-anchored cyt cy. In species like R. capsulatus, cyt cy functions in both Ps and respiratory electron transport chains, whereas in other species like R. sphaeroides, it does so only in respiration. The molecular bases of this difference was investigated by producing a soluble variant of cyt cy (S-cy), by fusing genetically the cyt c2 signal sequence to the cyt c domain of cyt cy. This novel electron carrier was unable to support the Ps growth of R. capsulatus. However, strains harboring cyt S-cy regained Ps growth ability by acquiring mutations in its cyt c domain. They produced cyt S-cy variants at amounts comparable with that of cyt c2, and conferred Ps growth. Chemical titration indicated that the redox midpoint potential of cyt S-cy was about 340 mV, similar to that of cyts c2 or cy. Remarkably, electron transfer kinetics from the cyt bc1 complex to the photochemical reaction center (RC) mediated by cyt S-cy was distinct from those seen with the cyt c2 or cyt cy. The kinetics exhibited a pronounced slow phase, suggesting that cyt S-cy interacted with the RC less tightly than cyt c2. Comparison of structural models of cyts c2 and S-cy revealed that several of the amino acid residues implicated in long-range electrostatic interactions promoting binding of cyt c2 to the RC are not conserved in cyt cy, whereas those supporting short-range hydrophobic interactions are conserved. These findings indicated that attaching electron carrier cytochromes to the membrane allowed them to weaken their interactions with their partners so that they could accommodate more rapid multiple turnovers. Biological energy transduction systems contain multiple electron carrier molecules connecting various chromophore-bearing membrane proteins (1Hunter N. Daldal F. Turnauer M. Beatty T. The Purple Photosynthetic Bacteria. 3rd Ed. Springer, Netherlands2008Google Scholar). Often, these electron carriers are freely diffusible in inter-membrane spaces to link efficiently large multisubunit membrane-embedded complexes. For example, Photosystem I and Photosystem II are interconnected via the copper containing plastocyanin in chloroplasts.

Sawaya M.R. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 648-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the case of the widely studied anoxygenic, purple non-sulfur, facultative phototrophs of the genus Rhodobacter, Ps growth relies on cyclic electron transfer (ET) between the photochemical reaction center (RC) and the cyt bc1 complex (3Prince R.C.

On the other hand, in R. sphaeroides only the cyt c2 fulfills this role, as the cyt cy homologue of this species is unable to support Ps growth (10Myllykallio H. Zannoni D. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4348-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cy cyts are structurally distinct from the c2 cyts as they have a linker domain of varying lengths in different species, attaching a highly conserved cyt c domain to a transmembrane anchor (7Jenney Jr., F.E. Daldal F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11Myllykallio H. Jenney Jr., F.E. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Rhodobacter species, both cyts c2 and cy can act as efficient electron carriers between the cyt bc1 complex and the respiratory (Res) cyt c oxidases (Cox) (12Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2388-2391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hochkoeppler A. Jenney Jr., F.E. Lang S.E. Zannoni D. Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 608-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, both Rhodobacter species also contain a hydroquinone oxidase (Qox)-dependent alternate Res pathway (14Zannoni D. Melandri B.A. Baccarini-Melandri A. Biochim. Biophys.

R. capsulatus mutants lacking cyts c2 and cy are unable to grow by Ps. They can be complemented to Ps+ by either R. capsulatus or R. sphaeroides cyt c2, but only by R. capsulatus (and not by R. sphaeroides) cyt cy (10Myllykallio H. Zannoni D. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Acta. 1996; 1273: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The soluble cyt c2 and membrane-anchored cyt cy interact differently with their physiological redox partners, which are the RC, the cyt bc1 complex, and the Cox (13Hochkoeppler A. Jenney Jr., F.E. Lang S.E. Zannoni D. Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 608-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Myllykallio H. Drepper F. Mathis P. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5501-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). During multiple turnovers, cyt cy transfers electrons from the cyt bc1 complex to the RC more efficiently than cyt c2 (19Myllykallio H. Drepper F. Mathis P. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5501-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas cyt c2 interconnects a large number of RCs, cyt cy interacts with a limited number of them (8Prince R.C. Davidson E. Haith C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5208-5214Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Myllykallio H. Drepper F. Mathis P. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5501-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, in the absence of the cyt bc1 complex, the steady-state amounts of cyt cy become lower, and the cyt cy kinetics change (9Jenney Jr., F.E. Prince R.C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2496-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting a higher order of organization between the physiological partners (20Myllykallio H. Drepper F. Mathis P.

Acta. 2006; 1757: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Available data indicate that both the differing lengths of the linker portions of cyt cy (47Lee D.-W. Öztürk Y. Osyczka A. Cooley J.W. Daldal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13973-13982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the amino acid sequences of their cyt c domains are important for the ET properties (10Myllykallio H. Zannoni D. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4348-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although cyt c2 can be fused to the linker portion of R. capsulatus cyt cy to yield a functional membrane-anchored cyt c2 variant (cyt MA-c2) (11Myllykallio H. Jenney Jr., F.E. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Daldal F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2623-2631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the cyt c domain of R. sphaeroides cyt cy does not substitute readily for its R. capsulatus counterpart (10Myllykallio H. Zannoni D. Daldal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4348-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To investigate the structural and functional features of cyt cy as an efficient electron carrier, and its interactions with its redox partners, genetically modified versions of membrane-anchored cyt cy were sought. Here, the production and properties of soluble, freely diffusible variants of cyt cy are described. Various cy cyts with differing linker lengths were fused to the cyt bc1 complex to prohibit their diffusion4 and yielded novel cyt bc1-cy fusion complexes (21Lee D.W. Ozturk Y. Mamedova A. Osyczka A. Cooley J.W. Daldal F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We found that cyt S-cy variants support native-like Ps growth provided that they are present at sufficient amounts in vivo. Remarkably, the RC-mediated oxidation kinetics of cyt S-cy are distinct from those exhibited by cyts c2 and cy. The findings suggest that, unlike the freely diffusing electron carriers (e.g. cyt c2), which depend heavily on electrostatic contacts to recognize their physiological partners, membrane-anchored electron carriers (e.g. cyt cy) are evolved to minimize binding interactions to maximize rapid multiple turnovers. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains and plasmids used are described in Table 1. MPYE enriched medium (6Daldal F. Cheng S. Applebaum J. Davidson E. Prince R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2012-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or Sistrom's minimal medium A (22Sistrom W.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1960; 22: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) supplemented with kanamycin or tetracycline as appropriate (10 or 2.5 μg/ml, respectively) were used for growth of R. capsulatus strains at 35 °C. Ps cultures were incubated under saturating light intensity in anaerobic jars containing H2 and CO2 generating gas packs (BBL 270304, BD Biosciences) (7Jenney Jr., F.E. Daldal F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strains were grown on Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin, kanamycin, or tetracycline (at 100, 50, or 12.5 μg/ml, respectively) as appropriate (6Daldal F. Cheng S. Applebaum J. Davidson E. Prince R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2012-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Molecular Genetic Techniques—R. capsulatus cyt S-cy was constructed by ligating the 3.4-kb EcoRI fragment of plasmid pHM5 containing the signal sequence of the cycA (structural gene of cyt c2) (6Daldal F. Cheng S. Applebaum J. Davidson E. Prince R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2012-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) to the 0.8-kb EcoRI fragment of pRKE12+ containing the cyt c domain of cycY* (structural gene of cyt cy with a silent EcoRI site) to yield plasmid pYO12 (Table 1). The 1.2-kb KpnI-BamHI fragment of pYO12 carrying cyt S-cy was transferred to plasmid pRK415 using the same sites, yielding pYO100. Spontaneous Ps+ revertants of cyt S-cy were isolated on tetracycline containing MPYE plates under Ps growth conditions. Plasmids carrying cyt S-cy were transformed into E. coli strain HB101, and reintroduced into the R. capsulatus strain FJ2 (cyt c2- cyt cy-) using triparental matings (6Daldal F. Cheng S. Applebaum J. Davidson E. Prince R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2012-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) to identify chromosomal or plasmid-borne reversion events. The molecular nature of the plasmid-borne reversion mutations were determined by automated DNA sequencing of the 1.2-kb DNA fragment carrying cycY, as recommended by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). The M13 universal primer and the following cycY internal primers, FR1 (5′-CAGAGTGGCGATGGCGG-3′), FR4 (5′-GCGGCCGATCACCCCGT-3′), FF2 (5′-ATGGCAAGAACGCCGTC), YOR1 (5′-GGCTGACCAGATAGATG-3′), YOF1 (5′-GCGACGCGAAAGCCGGC-3′), and YOF2 (5′-TTGGCCCCGGCTCCAGA-3) were used as sequencing primers as appropriate. The double mutant cyt S-cyR35, which combined mutations R3 (H53Y) and R5 (K19R) isolated as described above, was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pYO26 carrying the cyt S-cyR5 allele using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer (25 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 10 min) with mutagenic primers YO3 (5′-CCGCGATGAAGAACTATGTCGGCAACTGG-ACGC-3′) and YO4 (5′-GCGTCCAGTTGCCGACATAGTTCTTCATCGCGG-3′) to yield plasmid pYO27. The 1.2-kb KpnI-BamHI fragment of pYO27 was then cloned into the same restriction sites of the broad host range plasmid pRK415 to yield pYO135 (cyt S-cyR35) (Table 1). Biochemical and Biophysical Techniques—Intra-cytoplasmic membrane vesicles (chromatophores), and chromatophore supernatant fractions (containing cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins), were prepared from R. capsulatus cells grown under Res conditions in MPYE by using a French pressure cell (at 18,000 p.s.i.) as described earlier (23Gray K.A. Grooms M. Myllykallio H. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3120-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Chromatophore membranes used for SDS-PAGE/3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMBZ) or light-activated kinetic spectroscopy analyses were prepared in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and containing either 1 or 100 mm KCl, respectively (9Jenney Jr., F.E. Prince R.C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2496-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 16.5% SDS-PAGE analyses were performed as described by Schägger and von Jagow (25Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Samples were denatured in SDS-loading buffer for 5 min at 37 °C, and following electrophoresis, the c-type cytochromes were revealed by their peroxidase activities using TMBZ and H2O2 (26Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Optical spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer UV-visible spectrophotometer (Lambda 20) fitted with an anaerobic redox cuvette, as needed. The difference spectra for c-type cytochromes were obtained with samples that were first oxidized by the addition of 20 μm potassium ferricyanide and then reduced by using either 1 mm sodium ascorbate, or a small amount of solid, fresh dithionite. Chemical reduction-oxidation midpoint potential (Em,7) determination of supernatant fractions of chromatophore membranes were performed according to Dutton (27Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) in 50 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0, in the presence of 15 to 30 μm of redox mediators (tetrachlorohyroquinone, 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine, 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate, 1,2-naphthoquinone, phenazine ethosulfate, phenazine methosulfate, duroquinone, pyocyanine, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, and anthraquinone-2-sulfonate) as described earlier (8Prince R.C. Davidson E. Haith C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5208-5214Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The optical changes that accompanied ambient redox potential changes were recorded between 500 and 600 nm, and the Em,7 values determined by fitting normalized data to a single n = 1 Nernst equation. Light-activated, millisecond time scale kinetic spectroscopy was performed using chromatophore membranes reduced with sodium ascorbate, as described earlier (8Prince R.C. Davidson E. Haith C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5208-5214Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Jenney Jr., F.E. Prince R.C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2496-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Following a flash of actinic light, cyt c re-reduction kinetics in the absence or presence of the cyt bc1 complex inhibitor stigmatellin (2.5 μm), and as needed, in the presence of valinomycin (2.5 μm) were monitored at 550-540 nm. The carotenoid band shift was monitored at 490-475 nm to follow the generation of the transmembrane potential by cyclic ET (8Prince R.C. Davidson E. Haith C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5208-5214Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Jenney Jr., F.E. Prince R.C. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2496-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Soluble Variants of R. capsulatus Cyt cy—A water-soluble, freely diffusible form of the membrane-anchored cyt cy from R. capsulatus (cyt S-cy) was obtained by genetically fusing the signal sequence of cyt c2 to the cyt c domain of cyt cy, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 2). Initially, this construct did not complement the R. capsulatus strain FJ2 lacking both cyts c2 and cy for Ps growth (Table 1), possibly because of the absence of adequate amounts of a soluble electron carrier. However, FJ2 derivatives harboring cyt S-cy reverted frequently to Ps+ (at a frequency of 10-6 to 10-7 on MPYE medium), and three such revertants (R3, R4, and R5) were retained for further studies. Molecular genetic analyses described under “Experimental Procedures” revealed that revertants R3 and R5 contained plasmid-borne Cys to Thr and Ala to Gly base pair substitutions in cycY, respectively, and produced cyt S-cyR3 (His at position 53 substituted with Tyr) and cyt S-cyR5 (Lys at position 19 substituted with Arg) variants of cyt S-cy. Subsequently, these two mutations were combined via site-directed mutagenesis to yield a double mutant (cyt S-cyR35) (Table 1), which complemented fully FJ2 for Ps+ growth (Fig. 3). On the other hand, it was found that Ps+ revertant R4 had a plasmid-borne wild type copy of cycY, but contained a chromosomal mutation (X). Although the molecular nature of X was not determined, revertant R4 was cured of its plasmid by successive subcultures on MPYE medium without antibiotic selection to yield FJ2-R4 (cyt c2-, cyt cy-, X-) (Table 1), used for some of the subsequent work due to its ability to enhance cyt c production, as described below.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this workStrainGenotypePhenotypeRef.E. coliHB101F proA2 hsdS20 (rB mB) recA13 ara-14 lacY1 galK2 rpsL20 supE44 rpsL20 supE44 proA2 xyl-5 mtl-145XL1-BluerecA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdr-17 supE44 relA1 lac [F′ proAB lac1 q ΔM15 Tn10]TetRStratageneR. capsulatusMT1131aR. capsulatus MT1131 is referred to as “wild type” as it is wild type with respect to its cyt c profile and growth properties.

Using this EcoRI site, the cyt c2 signal sequence was then fused to the cyt c domain of cyt cy to yield cyt S-cy, as indicated.

Moreover, the Ps growth phenotypes of all three cyt S-cy variants were further improved in the FJ2-R4 background to the point that even cyt S-cy that was Ps- in FJ2 conferred a weak Ps+/- growth in this strain (Fig. 3B).TABLE 2Properties of various soluble derivatives of R. capsulatus cyt cyPlasmidsCyt derivativeFJ2FJ2-R4PhenotypeaPs+ and Res+ indicate the ability to grow under photosynthetic and respiratory (Res) growth conditions, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Amounts and Properties of Cyt S-cy Produced by Various Ps+Revertants—The c-type cyt profiles of Ps+ revertants, grown under Res+ conditions in MPYE medium, were examined by both SDS-PAGE/TMBZ analysis and reduced minus oxidized optical difference spectra. As expected, the membrane-bound cyt cy was absent in chromatophore membranes of FJ2 (cyt c2-, cytcy-) and FJ2-R4 (cyt c2- cyt cy-, X-), whereas the amounts of the cyts c1, co, and cp were unchanged (data not shown). In chromatophore membrane supernatants prepared using FJ2 derivatives cyt S-cy was undetectable, whereas cyt S-cyR5 (K19R), cyt S-cyR3 (H53Y), and cyt S-cyR35 (K19R and H53Y) were barely visible (Fig. 4A). In contrast, in the FJ2-R4 background the amounts of these c-type cytochromes, especially those of cyt S-cyR5 and cyt S-cyR35, increased and became readily detectable. As expected, the cyts S-cy are slightly smaller (about 10 kDa) than cyt c2 and cyt c′ (about 12 kDa) (Fig. 4B). Apparently, the effect(s) of the mutation(s) in FJ2-R4 is specific to cyt S-cy variants, because the amounts of native cyt c2 or cyt c′ were not affected significantly. The strain FJ2-R4 background was used for subsequent work instead of FJ2, as it enhanced production of the cyt S-cy variants (Table 2), and improved their Ps+ growth phenotypes (Fig. 3). We note that two additional TMBZ/H2O2-stained bands (about 19 and 34 kDa) were also detected in the supernatant fractions (Fig. 4). The higher molecular weight protein was identified by nano-LC-MS/MS analyses to correspond to R. capsulatus cyt c peroxidase (RRC03"
