https://openalex.org/W2410619939,"Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) currently attract enormous research interest because of their high solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication costs, but their practical development is hampered by difficulties in achieving high performance with large-size devices. We devised a simple vacuum flash–assisted solution processing method to obtain shiny, smooth, crystalline perovskite films of high electronic quality over large areas. This enabled us to fabricate solar cells with an aperture area exceeding 1 square centimeter, a maximum efficiency of 20.5%, and a certified PCE of 19.6%. By contrast, the best certified PCE to date is 15.6% for PSCs of similar size. We demonstrate that the reproducibility of the method is excellent and that the cells show virtually no hysteresis. Our approach enables the realization of highly efficient large-area PSCs for practical deployment."

However, the intermediate stages through which individual cells progress during reprogramming are largely undefined. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing at multiple time points to dissect direct reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neuronal cells. By deconstructing heterogeneity at each time point and ordering cells by transcriptome similarity, we find that the molecular reprogramming path is remarkably continuous. Overexpression of the proneural pioneer factor Ascl1 results in a well-defined initialization, causing cells to exit the cell cycle and re-focus gene expression through distinct neural transcription factors. The initial transcriptional response is relatively homogeneous among fibroblasts, suggesting that the early steps are not limiting for productive reprogramming. Instead, the later emergence of a competing myogenic program and variable transgene dynamics over time appear to be the major efficiency limits of direct reprogramming. Moreover, a transcriptional state, distinct from donor and target cell programs, is transiently induced in cells undergoing productive reprogramming. Our data provide a high-resolution approach for understanding transcriptome states during lineage differentiation."

These authors report a preclinical evaluation and optimization of mitochondria replacement therapy using pronuclear transfer. The influence of different parameters and manipulations is evaluated in normally fertilized human embryos, and the improved protocol is shown to produce blastocysts with a low level of mitochondrial carryover. The results highlight the need for continued optimization and monitoring of mitochondria replacement therapy techniques for future human application. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are maternally inherited and are associated with a broad range of debilitating and fatal diseases1. Reproductive technologies designed to uncouple the inheritance of mtDNA from nuclear DNA may enable affected women to have a genetically related child with a greatly reduced risk of mtDNA disease. Here we report the first preclinical studies on pronuclear transplantation (PNT). Surprisingly, techniques used in proof-of-concept studies involving abnormally fertilized human zygotes2 were not well tolerated by normally fertilized zygotes. We have therefore developed an alternative approach based on transplanting pronuclei shortly after completion of meiosis rather than shortly before the first mitotic division. This promotes efficient development to the blastocyst stage with no detectable effect on aneuploidy or gene expression. After optimization, mtDNA carryover was reduced to <2% in the majority (79%) of PNT blastocysts. The importance of reducing carryover to the lowest possible levels is highlighted by a progressive increase in heteroplasmy in a stem cell line derived from a PNT blastocyst with 4% mtDNA carryover. We conclude that PNT has the potential to reduce the risk of mtDNA disease, but it may not guarantee prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2406947205,"Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) is widely used by organic chemists to functionalize aromatic molecules, and it is the most commonly used method to generate arenes that contain (18)F for use in positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging. A wide range of nucleophiles exhibit SNAr reactivity, and the operational simplicity of the reaction means that the transformation can be conducted reliably and on large scales. During SNAr, attack of a nucleophile at a carbon atom bearing a 'leaving group' leads to a negatively charged intermediate called a Meisenheimer complex. Only arenes with electron-withdrawing substituents can sufficiently stabilize the resulting build-up of negative charge during Meisenheimer complex formation, limiting the scope of SNAr reactions: the most common SNAr substrates contain strong π-acceptors in the ortho and/or para position(s). Here we present an unusual concerted nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (CSNAr) that is not limited to electron-poor arenes, because it does not proceed via a Meisenheimer intermediate. We show a phenol deoxyfluorination reaction for which CSNAr is favoured over a stepwise displacement. Mechanistic insights enabled us to develop a functional-group-tolerant (18)F-deoxyfluorination reaction of phenols, which can be used to synthesize (18)F-PET probes. Selective (18)F introduction, without the need for the common, but cumbersome, azeotropic drying of (18)F, can now be accomplished from phenols as starting materials, and provides access to (18)F-labelled compounds not accessible through conventional chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W2412914653,"Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) arises after transformation of a haemopoietic stem cell (HSC) by the protein-tyrosine kinase BCR–ABL. Direct inhibition of BCR–ABL kinase has revolutionized disease management, but fails to eradicate leukaemic stem cells (LSCs), which maintain CML. LSCs are independent of BCR–ABL for survival, providing a rationale for identifying and targeting kinase-independent pathways. Here we show—using proteomics, transcriptomics and network analyses—that in human LSCs, aberrantly expressed proteins, in both imatinib-responder and non-responder patients, are modulated in concert with p53 (also known as TP53) and c-MYC regulation. Perturbation of both p53 and c-MYC, and not BCR–ABL itself, leads to synergistic cell kill, differentiation, and near elimination of transplantable human LSCs in mice, while sparing normal HSCs. This unbiased systems approach targeting connected nodes exemplifies a novel precision medicine strategy providing evidence that LSCs can be eradicated. Leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) are responsible for BCR–ABL-driven chronic myeloid leukaemia relapse; here, p53 and MYC signalling networks are shown to regulate LSCs concurrently, and targeting both these pathways has a synergistic effect in managing the disease. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are a first-line therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), where they target the oncogenic BCR-ABL fusion gene. However, relapse inevitably occurs, probably driven by a drug-resistant population of leukaemic stem cells (LSCs). This study uncovers the concurrent involvement of p53 and Myc signalling networks in regulating LSCs. The authors demonstrate that genetic and/or pharmacological targeting of both the p53 and c-Myc pathways achieves more effective disease neutralization in mouse and human cell models of CML."
https://openalex.org/W2411492321,"INTRODUCTION Although recent advances in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies have made practical the writing and readout of arbitrary data in the form of synthetic DNA, still lacking are the robust tools necessary to generate a dynamic record of such information within the genomes of living cells. An in vivo system, built out of biological parts with large storage capacity, would enable the recording of defined biological events into stable genetic memory and facilitate the tracking of long molecular and cellular histories. RATIONALE The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)–Cas system is a prokaryotic type of immunological memory. Foreign DNA sequences originating from viral infections are stored within genome-based arrays in the form of short sequences—called spacers—that confer sequence-specific resistance to the invading nucleic acids. These arrays not only preserve the spacer sequences but also record the order in which the sequences are acquired, generating a temporal record of acquisition events. We harnessed this system to record arbitrary DNA sequences into a genomic CRISPR array in the form of spacers acquired from synthetic oligonucleotides electroporated into a population of cells overexpressing the CRISPR adaptation proteins Cas1 and Cas2. This enabled the recording of defined molecular events into a stable genomic locus over time and the storage of arbitrary information across a population of cells. RESULTS We show that the Cas1-Cas2 complex can be used in vivo to integrate synthetic DNA of a defined sequence into the Escherichia coli genome. We used this feature to examine the type I-E CRISPR-Cas spacer acquisition process and optimized the synthetic spacer design to achieve higher acquisition efficiency and specific integration orientation through the addition of an AAG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). We then generated stable genomic recordings of multiple molecular events by electroporating sets of oligonucleotides over several days. These molecular records were read out with high-throughput sequencing and then decoded with a program that identified and faithfully reconstructed the temporal event order. Last, we used directed evolution to generate many Cas1-Cas2 mutants with modified PAM specificity (PAM NC ). By modulating expression of these mutant and wild-type Cas1-Cas2 complexes, we could dynamically control the orientation of spacer integration. This enabled us to record acquisition events in multiple modes. That is, information was encoded in both the temporal order of the spacers and the orientation in which they were integrated. CONCLUSION Our results establish a recording system that uses the nucleotide content, temporal ordering, and orientation of defined DNA sequences within a CRISPR array in order to encode arbitrary information within the genomes of a population of cells. Because information can be encoded in spacer nucleotide space (up to two bits per base) and in alternate modes, the system has the potential to record and permanently store higher capacities of information than any other synthetic biological system to date. This lays the foundation for an in vivo recording device that could be coupled with diverse molecular phenomena and used for applications that require tracing of long molecular histories. We also demonstrate that delivery of synthetic DNA substrates to a CRISPR-Cas adaptation system in vivo is a practical method to probe and adapt the system. Two modes of encoding information into the CRISPR locus. ( A ) Oligonucleotides containing an AAG PAM and 32 variable bases were electroporated into cells overexpressing Cas1-Cas2 and inserted into the genomic CRISPR array. Delivery of oligos with distinct sequence over time generates a molecular record. ( B ) Cas1-Cas2 mutants identified through directed evolution alter the orientation of acquisition. Varying expression ratios of wild-type and mutant Cas1-Cas2 over time generates a record encoded in spacer orientation."

https://openalex.org/W2412323428,"The contamination of the widely used lifesaving anticoagulant drug heparin in 2007 has drawn renewed attention to the challenges that are associated with the characterization, quality control and standardization of complex biological medicines from natural sources. Heparin is a linear, highly sulfated polysaccharide consisting of alternating glucosamine and uronic acid monosaccharide residues. Heparin has been used successfully as an injectable antithrombotic medicine since the 1930s, and its isolation from animal sources (primarily porcine intestine) as well as its manufacturing processes have not changed substantially since its introduction. The 2007 heparin contamination crisis resulted in several deaths in the United States and hundreds of adverse reactions worldwide, revealing the vulnerability of a complex global supply chain to sophisticated adulteration. This Perspective discusses how the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) and international stakeholders collaborated to redefine quality expectations for heparin, thus making an important natural product better controlled and less susceptible to economically motivated adulteration."

https://openalex.org/W2419360491,"Objectives Although fibromyalgia criteria have been in effect for decades, little is known about how the fibromyalgia diagnosis is applied and understood by clinicians and patients. We used the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to determine the prevalence of self-reported clinician diagnosed fibromyalgia and then compared demographics, symptoms, disability and medical utilization measures of persons with a clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia that did not meet diagnostic criteria (false-positive or prior [F/P] fibromyalgia) to persons with and without criteria-positive fibromyalgia. Methods The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) collected information about both clinical diagnosis and symptoms of fibromyalgia that was appropriately weighted to represent 225,726,257 US adults. Surrogate NHIS diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia were developed based on the level of polysymptomatic distress (PSD) as characterized in the 2011 modified American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR) for fibromyalgia. Persons with F/P fibromyalgia were compared with persons who do not have fibromyalgia and those meeting surrogate NHIS fibromyalgia criteria. Results Of the 1.78% of persons reporting a clinical diagnosis, 73.5% did not meet NHIS fibromyalgia criteria. The prevalence of F/P fibromyalgia is 1.3%. F/P fibromyalgia is associated with a mild degree of polysymptomatic distress (NHIS PSD score 6.2) and characterized by frequent but not widespread pain and insomnia. Measures of work disability and medical utilization in F/P fibromyalgia were equal to that seen with NHIS criteria positive fibromyalgia and were 6-7x greater in F/P fibromyalgia than in non-fibromyalgia persons. F/P fibromyalgia was best predicted by being female (Odds Ratio [OR] 8.81), married (OR 3.27), and white (OR 1.96). In contrast, being a white, married woman was only modestly predictive of NHIS (criteria positive) fibromyalgia (OR 2.1). Conclusions The majority of clinically diagnosed fibromyalgia cases in the US do not reach levels of severity necessary and sufficient for diagnosis. The clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia is disproportionally dependent on demographic and social factors rather than the symptoms themselves. Diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia appear to be used as a vague guide by clinicians and patients, and allow for substantial diagnostic expansion of fibromyalgia."
https://openalex.org/W2418888413,"Developmental specification of germ cells lies at the heart of inheritance, as germ cells contain all of the genetic and epigenetic information transmitted between generations. The critical developmental event distinguishing germline from somatic lineages is the differentiation of primordial germ cells (PGCs), precursors of sex-specific gametes that produce an entire organism upon fertilization. Germ cells toggle between uni- and pluripotent states as they exhibit their own 'latent' form of pluripotency. For example, PGCs express a number of transcription factors in common with embryonic stem (ES) cells, including OCT4 (encoded by Pou5f1), SOX2, NANOG and PRDM14 (refs 2, 3, 4). A biochemical mechanism by which these transcription factors converge on chromatin to produce the dramatic rearrangements underlying ES-cell- and PGC-specific transcriptional programs remains poorly understood. Here we identify a novel co-repressor protein, CBFA2T2, that regulates pluripotency and germline specification in mice. Cbfa2t2(-/-) mice display severe defects in PGC maturation and epigenetic reprogramming. CBFA2T2 forms a biochemical complex with PRDM14, a germline-specific transcription factor. Mechanistically, CBFA2T2 oligomerizes to form a scaffold upon which PRDM14 and OCT4 are stabilized on chromatin. Thus, in contrast to the traditional 'passenger' role of a co-repressor, CBFA2T2 functions synergistically with transcription factors at the crossroads of the fundamental developmental plasticity between uni- and pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2417739094,"The oomycete Phytophthora infestans causes late blight of potato, which can completely destroy the crop. Therefore, for the past 160 years, late blight has been the most important potato disease worldwide. The identification of cultivars with high and durable field resistance to P. infestans is an objective of most potato breeding programs. This type of resistance is polygenic and therefore quantitative. Its evaluation requires multi-year and location trials. Furthermore, quantitative resistance to late blight correlates with late plant maturity, a negative agricultural trait. Knowledge of the molecular genetic basis of quantitative resistance to late blight not compromised by late maturity is very limited. It is however essential for developing diagnostic DNA markers that facilitate the efficient combination of superior resistance alleles in improved cultivars. We used association genetics in a population of 184 tetraploid potato cultivars in order to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with maturity corrected resistance (MCR) to late blight. The population was genotyped for almost 9000 SNPs from three different sources. The first source was candidate genes specifically selected for their function in the jasmonate pathway. The second source was novel candidate genes selected based on comparative transcript profiling (RNA-Seq) of groups of genotypes with contrasting levels of quantitative resistance to P. infestans. The third source was the first generation 8.3k SolCAP SNP genotyping array available in potato for genome wide association studies (GWAS). Twenty seven SNPs from all three sources showed robust association with MCR. Some of those were located in genes that are strong candidates for directly controlling quantitative resistance, based on functional annotation. Most important were: a lipoxygenase (jasmonate pathway), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (mevalonate pathway), a P450 protein (terpene biosynthesis), a transcription factor and a homolog of a major gene for resistance to P. infestans from the wild potato species Solanum venturii. The candidate gene approach and GWAS complemented each other as they identified different genes. The results of this study provide new insight in the molecular genetic basis of quantitative resistance in potato and a toolbox of diagnostic SNP markers for breeding applications."

Natural killer (NK) cells display cytotoxic activity against susceptible target cells and modulate innate and adaptive immune responses through their interaction with DCs. We here show that human NK cells also express α7 nAChR. α7 nAChR mRNA is detected by RT-PCR and cell surface expression of α7 nAChR is detected by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry using α-bungarotoxin, a specific antagonist. Both mRNA and protein levels increase during NK stimulation with cytokines (IL-12, IL-18, and IL-15). Exposure of cytokine-stimulated NK cells to PNU-282987, a specific α7 nAChR agonist, increases intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) mainly released from intracellular stores, indicating that α7 nAChR is functional. Moreover, its activation by PNU-282987 plus a specific positive allosteric modulator greatly enhances the Ca2+ responses in NK cells. Stimulation of NK cells with cytokines and PNU-282987 decreases NF-κB levels and nuclear mobilization, down-regulates NKG2D receptors, and decreases NKG2D-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production. Also, such NK cells are less efficient to trigger DC maturation.

Neurotransmitter-gated ion channels of the Cys-loop receptor family are synaptic receptors that convert a chemical signal into an electrical one by rapidly opening a channel that allows the flux of ions through the membrane (1.Bouzat C. et al.New insights into the structural bases of activation of Cys-loop receptors.J.

The activity of NK cells is controlled by a dynamic balance of signals elicited upon engagement of activating and inhibitory receptors by discrete ligands expressed on target cells (23.Zwirner N.W.

It has been demonstrated that mouse NK cells express β2 nAChR subunit and that this subunit is involved in nicotine-induced attenuation of mouse NK cell functions (29.Hao J. Shi F.D. Abdelwahab M. Shi S.X. Simard A. Whiteaker P. Lukas R.

Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate the expression of α7 nAChR in human NK cells and the regulation of NK cell effector functions by α7 nAChR ligands. We report here the first experimental evidence demonstrating the expression of α7 nAChR on human NK cells and the biological consequences of its activation. First, we isolated NK cells from healthy donors and assessed the expression of α7 nAChR mRNA by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, freshly isolated human NK cells express α7 nAChR mRNA. By analogy with other immune cells, we hypothesized that the expression of nAChRs in NK cells changes upon cell activation (8.De Rosa M.J. Dionisio L. Agriello E. Bouzat C.

As human NK cells become activated by cytokines, particularly IL-12, IL-18, and IL-15 (23.Zwirner N.W. Domaica C.I. et al.Cytokine regulation of natural killer cell effector functions.Biofactors. 2010; 36: 274-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33.Chijioke O.

Leong J.W. Fehniger T.A. et al.Utilizing cytokines to function-enable human NK cells for the immunotherapy of cancer.Scientifica. 2014; 2014: 205796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and considering that these cytokines increase during inflammation, we stimulated NK cells with these cytokines and performed a kinetic analysis of α7 nAChR mRNA expression by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The results show that α7 nAChR mRNA peaks at 48 h after cell stimulation and returns to background levels after 72 h (data not shown). The peak corresponds to a ∼3.1-fold increase in α7 nAChR mRNA with respect to that of fresh cells (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we chose 48 h stimulation with cytokines for all our experiments. We also detected in freshly isolated NK cells mRNA corresponding to α4 (Fig. 1C) and β2 (Fig. 1E) nAChR subunits. By qPCR we determined that after cytokine stimulation of NK cells, the mRNA level of α4 nAChR does not change significantly (Fig. 1D), whereas that of β2 slightly increases with respect to fresh cells (Fig. 1F). As different nAChR types are present in human NK cells, we used a selective α7 nAChR agonist (PNU-282987) and a specific antagonist (α-BTX) for further functional experiments. Cell surface expression of α7 nAChR was analyzed using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled α-BTX, a selective α7 nAChR antagonist, in NK cells cultured in the absence or presence of IL-12, IL-18, and IL-15 for 48 h and assessed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2A) and flow cytometry (FC) (Fig. 2B). In line with the qPCR results, an increased number of fluorescent cells and higher fluorescence per cell are observed on stimulated NK cells compared with resting cells. The pretreatment with α-BTX markedly reduces the binding of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled α-BTX to the cells (Fig. 2). These results indicate that NK cells express surface α7 nAChR that is up-regulated during NK stimulation with cytokines. To investigate whether α7 nAChR in NK cells is functional and its activation triggers the typical changes in [Ca2+]i, we conducted confocal microscopy analysis of NK cells cultured in the presence of cytokines during 48 h and loaded with Fluo-3/AM. PNU-282987 leads to a slow and continuous increase of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3, B, E, and F). Although the magnitude of the responses vary among individual cells, all cells show a clear change in [Ca2+]i after agonist addition (Fig. 3, A and B). The Ca2+ responses are not detected in resting cells, probably due to the lower expression level of α7 nAChR as also described in lymphocytes (8.De Rosa M.J. Dionisio L. Agriello E. Bouzat C. Esandi Mdel C. et al.α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor modulates lymphocyte activation.Life Sci. 2009; 85: 444-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31.Landais E. Liautaud-Roger F. Antonicelli F. et al.Lymphocytes prime activation is required for nicotine-induced calcium waves.Front. Biosci. 2010; 2: 928-939Google Scholar). To further confirm that the increase in [Ca2+]i is mediated by α7 nAChR, we co-applied PNU-282987 with PNU-120596, which is a specific α7 nAChR positive allosteric modulator (PAM) (35.daCosta C.J. Free C.R. Corradi J. Bouzat C. Sine S.M. et al.Single-channel and structural foundations of neuronal α7 acetylcholine receptor potentiation.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13870-13879Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As expected, the presence of the PAM leads to an enhanced increase of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3, C and G), which is revealed by a slight increase in maximum fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3I) and an increase in the rate of change in Ca2+ signal (Fig. 3, F and G). The area under the curve is 20% bigger in the presence of the agonist and PAM with respect to the agonist alone. Moreover, the change in [Ca2+]i induced by PNU-282987 is abolished if cells are preincubated 15 min with 1 μm α-BTX, again confirming that the effect is specifically mediated by α7 nAChR activation (Fig. 3, D, H, and I). To further elucidate the origin of the [Ca2+]i increased by PNU-282987, we stimulated human NK cells with this agonist in Ca2+-free buffer containing 5 mm EGTA, an extracellular Ca2+ chelator. The PNU282987-elicited increase in [Ca2+]i is not affected by the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4, A, C, and E). In contrast, the increase in [Ca2+]i is inhibited by preincubation of cells with 5 μm BAPTA-AM, a cell-permeable intracellular Ca2+ chelator (Fig. 4, B and D). These results demonstrate that α7 nAChR in NK cells is functional and its activation releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores, which, in turn, may modulate cell function. We next examined whether activation of α7 nAChR affects the expression of some major NK cell activating receptors such as NKG2D, NKp46, and DNAM-1. To achieve maximal effects, we first incubated NK cells with IL-12, IL-18, and IL-15 for 48 h to promote maximal α7 nAChR expression. Thereafter, we treated the cells for 18 h in the presence of the cytokines with the agonist and/or antagonist, and assessed their effects on the expression of the NK cell receptors by FC. We observed that PNU-282987 induces down-regulation of NKG2D, and is abolished by preincubation of cells with α-BTX (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the expression levels of the other NK cell receptors, NKp46 and DNAM-1, are not affected by the presence of PNU-282987 (Fig. 5, B and C). Of note, PNU-282987 does not affect NK cell viability (11.3 ± 2.2% of cell death in control versus 12.9 ± 2.1% in PNU-282987-treated cells). These experiments indicate that activation of α7 nAChR down-regulates selectively the expression of NKG2D, which is one of the major activating receptors involved in NK cell function. To determine the physiological consequences of activation of α7 nAChR on NK cells, we assessed their NKG2D-dependent cytotoxic activity and IFN-γ production. In both studies, NK cells were stimulated with cytokines for 48 h and further cultured for 18 h with cytokines in the absence or presence of α7 nAChR agonist or antagonist. To assess NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity, we used a mouse urothelial carcinoma cell (MB49) transduced to stably express MICA on the cell surface (one of the known ligands for NKG2D (36.Lam R.A. Chwee J.Y. Le Bert N. Sauer M. Pogge von Strandmann E. Gasser S. et al.Regulation of self-ligands for activating natural killer cell receptors.Ann. Med. 2013; 45: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37.Mistry A.R. O'Callaghan C.A. et al.Regulation of ligands for the activating receptor NKG2D.Immunology. 2007; 121: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)) or its corresponding negative control transduced with empty vector as target cells (Fig. 6A). We observed that NK cells display a higher cytotoxic activity against MB49-MICA cells than against MB49-pMSCV (negative control) cells, confirming the role of the NKG2D-MICA receptor-ligand pair in this response (Fig. 6B). However, NK cells exposed previously to the specific α7 nAChR agonist display a significantly reduced cytotoxic activity against MB-49-MICA cells, close to the background cytotoxicity observed with MB49-pMSCV cells (Fig. 6B). We conclude that PNU-282987 blunts NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity of NK cells, which is in line with the observed down-regulation of NKG2D induced by the α7 nAChR agonist. Similarly, the percentage of IFN-γ-producing NK cells is significantly lower if NK cells are stimulated with cytokines and exposed to PNU-282987 (Fig. 6C). In both functional assays, the effect of PNU-282987 is prevented by α-BTX (Fig. 6, B and C), indicating that α7 nAChR negatively regulates NKG2D-dependent cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production of NK cells. To gain further insight into the biological consequences of α7 nAChR activation on human NK cells and its repercussion on their cross-talk with DCs, human NK cells were stimulated for 48 h with IL-12/IL-18/IL-15, and further cultured for 18 h with cytokines in the absence or presence of PNU-282987. Thereafter, these NK cells were co-cultured with immature DCs (iDCs) for 4 h and we evaluated the expression of MHC-II, CD86 (a costimulatory molecule), and CD83 (DC maturation marker) on DCs (Fig. 7). We observed that pre-treatment of cytokine-stimulated NK cells with PNU-282987 results in significantly lower expression of MHC-II and CD83 in DCs, and less percentage of CD86high DCs (Fig. 7) compared with cytokine-stimulated NK cells not exposed to the α7 nAChR agonist. These data indicate that activation of α7 nAChR on NK cells attenuates DC activation/maturation. Stimulation of NK cells with cytokines triggers intracellular pathways, some of which converge in NF-κB activation. Besides, activation of α7 nAChR inhibits NF-κB activation in macrophages (38.Wang H. Liao H. Ochani M. Justiniani M. Lin X. Yang L. Al-Abed Y. Wang H. Metz C. Miller E.J. Tracey K.J. Ulloa L. et al.Cholinergic agonists inhibit HMGB1 release and improve survival in experimental sepsis.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 1216-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored whether activation of this transcription factor is affected by α7 nAChR activation in human NK cells stimulated with IL-12, IL-18, and IL-15 (Fig. 8). We observed that NK cells stimulated with cytokines display an intense nuclear staining and that PNU-282987 produces a reduction in the nuclear mobilization of NF-κB p65 (Fig. 8, A, B, and D). This effect is abolished if cells are preincubated 15 min with α-BTX (Fig. 8C). In addition, the expression of NF-κB p65 is lower in cytokine-stimulated NK cells exposed to PNU-282987 than in those not exposed to the agonist as assessed by both fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 8D) and FC (Fig. 8, E and F). The present study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the presence of functional α7 nAChR on human NK cells, which is up-regulated after cytokine stimulation. We show that α7 nAChR activation in cytokine-stimulated NK cells triggers Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores, decreases IFN-γ production probably by reducing NF-κB levels and its nuclear translocation, decreases cell-cytotoxic activity due to down-regulation of NKG2D receptor, and attenuates the activation/maturation of DCs. Several lines of evidence, including those from our laboratory (8.De Rosa M.J. Dionisio L. Agriello E. Bouzat C.

Thus, the current results extend the expression of α7, α4, and β2 nAChRs to NK cells. Interestingly, NK cells from mouse do not express α7 nAChR mRNA (29.Hao J. Shi F.D. Abdelwahab M. Shi S.X.

These peptides were grouped into three classes termed Site 1, Site 2, and Site 3 based on their mutual competition of binding to the receptor. Further refinement has yielded, in particular, a 36-residue Site 2-Site 1 fusion peptide, S519, that binds the insulin receptor with subnanomolar affinity and exhibits agonist activity in both lipogenesis and glucose uptake assays. Here, we report three-dimensional crystallographic detail of the interaction of the C-terminal, 16-residue Site 1 component (S519C16) of S519 with the first leucine-rich repeat domain (L1) of the insulin receptor. Our structure shows that S519C16 binds to the same site on the L1 surface as that occupied by a critical component of the primary binding site, namely the helical C-terminal segment of the insulin receptor α-chain (termed αCT). In particular, the two phenylalanine residues within the FYXWF motif of S519C16 are seen to engage the insulin receptor L1 domain surface in a fashion almost identical to the respective αCT residues Phe701 and Phe705. The structure provides a platform for the further development of peptidic and/or small molecule agents directed toward the insulin receptor and/or the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor."

This material is one of the richest sources of polyphenolic compounds such as flavonoids and phenolic acids. The ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) evokes antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and anticancer properties. Due to pharmacological properties it is used in the commercial production of nutritional supplements. In this study, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to quantify main polyphenols in EEPs. The effect of EEPs, individual EEPs components (chrysin, galangin, pinocembrin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid) and their mixture on viability of human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line (CAL-27) as well as the molecular mechanisms of the process were examined. The results of MTTs assay demonstrated that EEP, polyphenols and mixture of polyphenolic compounds were cytotoxic for CAL-27 cells in a dose dependent manner. The mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by these components undergoes through apoptosis as detected by flow cytometry. The ethanolic extracts of propolis activated caspases -3, -8, -9. Mixture of polyphenols was found as the most potent inducer of apoptosis thorough both intrinsic and extrinsic pathway. Therefore, we suggest that anticancer properties of propolis is related to synergistic activity of its main components."

However, 90% of acutely infected adults can clear the virus, suggesting the presence of other, interferon-independent pathways leading to viral clearance. Given the known ability of helicases to bind viral nucleic acids, we performed a functional screening assay to identify helicases that regulate HBV replication. We identified the superkiller viralicidic activity 2-like (SKIV2L) RNA helicase (a homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ski2 protein) on the basis of its direct and preferential interaction with HBV X-mRNA. This interaction was essential for HBV X-mRNA degradation at the RNA exosome. The degradation of HBV X-mRNA at the RNA exosome was also mediated by HBS1L (HBS1-like translational GTPase) protein, a known component of the host RNA quality control system. We found that the redundant HBV-precore translation initiation site present at the 3′-end of HBV X-mRNA (3′ precore) is translationally active. The initiation of translation from this site without a proper stop codon was identified by the non-stop-mediated RNA decay mechanism leading to its degradation. Although 3′ precore is present in the five main HBV-RNA transcripts, only X-mRNA lacks the presence of an upstream start codons for large, middle, and small (L, M, and S) HBV surface proteins. These upstream codons are in-frame with 3′ precore translation initiation site, blocking its translation from the other HBV-mRNA transcripts.

Viral infections are initially detected and counteracted by the host through the innate immune response (1Orzalli M.H. Knipe D.M. et al.Cellular sensing of viral DNA and viral evasion mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 68: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The activation of the innate response is required for the production of interferon (IFN) and other inflammatory cytokines that act both directly (by suppressing the viral infection) and indirectly (by bridging the shift from innate to adaptive immune response, permitting the efficient elimination of the infection) (2Schnare M. Barton G.M. Holt A.C. Takeda K. Akira S. Medzhitov R. et al.Toll-like receptors control activation of adaptive immune responses.Nat.

Some of the innate antiviral immune responses are continuously expressed, not amplified, permitting the restriction of incoming viruses immediately after infection. These processes are constitutive and are not induced by the virus or external ligands (3Yan N. Chen Z.J. et al.Intrinsic antiviral immunity.Nat.

The HBV genome is partially double-stranded relaxed circular DNA of 3200 base pairs with overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Inside the nucleus the relaxed circular DNA is converted by the host DNA repair pathway to form the covalently closed circular DNA. Although HBV covalently closed circular DNA is transcribed into five main RNA species with different lengths, all of these transcripts share the same polyadenylation signal and have a common 3′-terminus (7Locarnini S.

The smallest of these transcripts (0.7 kb) encodes the HBV X protein, which is a transcription transactivator that is important for HBV life cycle.

This observation suggests the possible presence of other, IFN-independent host mechanisms that facilitate HBV clearance. Through targeting of viral-RNA for clearance, the host RNA-decay machineries have been implicated in the host defense against viral infection.

In mammalian cells, however, RNAi does not appear to play a significant antiviral role (14Cullen B.R. et al.Viruses and RNA interference: issues and controversies.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 12934-12936Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) was found to degrade human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), filoviruses, Sindbis virus, HBV, and murine gamma herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) viral RNAs containing ZAP-responsive element (ZRE). ZAP binding of ZREs recruits cellular RNA-decay machinery, including that of the RNA exosome (13Rigby R.E.

RNA quality control mechanisms are thought to have evolved to screen for, and degrade, abnormal RNA transcripts, thereby maintaining the integrity of the flow of genetic information (from DNA to RNA to functional protein) (13Rigby R.E. Rehwinkel J. et al.RNA degradation in antiviral immunity and autoimmunity.Trends Immunol. 2015; 36: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Viral RNAs, which may exhibit abnormal RNA structures, may be identified by these mechanisms, leading to degradation of these transcripts. One of these RNA quality control mechanisms, nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD), has been shown to participate in the host anti-viral defense by identifying foreign viral RNAs and targeting such transcripts for degradation in both plants and mammals (16Balistreri G. Horvath P. Schweingruber C. Zünd D. McInerney G. Merits A. Mühlemann O. Azzalin C.

Voinnet O. et al.Nonsense-mediated decay serves as a general viral restriction mechanism in plants.Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 16: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In yeast, aberrant mRNAs lacking in-frame termination codons are recognized and degraded by the non-stop decay (NSD) pathway. The NSD mechanism requires the interaction of RNA exosome with the Ski complex, a multiprotein structure that includes the Ski2p helicase and (notably) Ski7p; this combination activates the degradation of aberrant mRNAs (18Lebreton A.

Johnson A.W. et al.The yeast antiviral proteins Ski2p, Ski3p, and Ski8p exist as a complex in vivo.RNA. 2000; 6: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic RNA exosome is a ubiquitous endo- and 3′ → 5′ exoribonuclease that cooperates with multiple co-factors, including the SKIV2L helicase, to direct the processing, quality control, and degradation of virtually all classes of RNAs. It includes highly conserved nine-subunit core proteins that share structural similarity with phosphorolytic exoribonucleases such as bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase (20Liu Q. Greimann J.C. Lima C.D. et al.Reconstitution, activities, and structure of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.Cell. 2006; 127: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Because mammalian cells lack an apparent Ski7p homolog, the occurrence of NSD in mammals has been a matter of debate. Recently, NSD was reported to occur in mammals, where the process was shown to depend on Hbs1, Dom34 (a binding partner of Hbs1), and components of the exosome-Ski complex (including, SKIV2L helicase, the human homolog of the yeast Ski2) (21Saito S. Hosoda N. Hoshino S. et al.The Hbs1-Dom34 protein complex functions in non-stop mRNA decay in mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 17832-17843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Screening for human helicases that suppress HBV replication was performed as mentioned under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1A); in short, we used Hep38.7-Tet cells, a subclone derived from HepAD38 in which HBV replication is controlled by a tetracycline-regulated promoter and a pre-arrayed library of 909 different lentiviruses carrying shRNA sequences targeting the genes encoding each of 133 human helicases. HBV replication was initiated by withdrawal of tetracycline treatment 24 h after shRNA transfection. Medium was changed every 2 days after a wash with PBS. Spent medium was collected on days 6 and 7. Cell viability on day 7 was measured using the XTT assay. Helicase gene-suppressing shRNA clones with increased HBV-DNA levels in the culture medium were subjected to confirmatory screening by measuring the intracellular level of HBV-DNA. Helicases whose HBV suppression activity was confirmed in the secondary screen (DDX3X, DDX3Y, DDX41, DHX35, DDX60, SKIV2L, and HELB) showed more than 2-fold induction of HBV-DNA titers in both the cells and medium when the corresponding genes were independently silenced with two or three different shRNAs (Fig. 1B). Notably, DDX3 previously was reported to bind HBV-polymerase protein and block its reverse transcriptase activity (22Wang H. Kim S. Ryu W.S. et al.DDX3 DEAD-Box RNA helicase inhibits hepatitis B virus reverse transcription by incorporation into nucleocapsids.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 5815-5824Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Additionally, DDX41 and DDX60 were reported as possible viral DNA sensors that induce anti-viral processes (23Zhang Z. Yuan B. Bao M. Lu N. Kim T. Liu Y.J. et al.The helicase DDX41 senses intracellular DNA mediated by the adaptor STING in dendritic cells.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 24Miyashita M. Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Seya T. et al.DDX60, a DEXD/H box helicase, is a novel antiviral factor promoting RIG-I-like receptor-mediated signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 3802-3819Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The anti-viral function of DHX35, SKIV2L, and HELB do not appear to have been previously reported. SKIV2L is the human homologue of the yeast SKI2 helicase. Because SKI2P previously was reported to suppress viral replication in yeast (25Widner W.R. Wickner R.B. et al.Evidence that the SKI antiviral system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae acts by blocking expression of viral mRNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4331-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we assessed whether SKIV2L possesses a similar activity in HepG2 cells, a line known to support HBV replication. Silencing of SKIV2L expression with two different shRNAs resulted in increased HBV-DNA titers in both cells and medium (Fig. 1B). SKIV2L overexpression in pUC-HBV-D-IND60 (HBV-D60)-transfected cells yielded decreased levels of both HBV core-associated DNA (p < 0.01) and HBV-RNA, as shown by real-time PCR (Fig. 1C) and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1D), respectively. SKIV2L overexpression in this background also slightly induced HBV core promoter activity while exhibiting no effect on pre-S, S, and X promoters (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that SKIV2L suppresses HBV at a post-transcriptional level. It is worth noting that SKIV2L-induced suppression of HBV replication was IFN-independent, as shown in Fig. 2. Although interferon-α (IFN-α) induced ISG15, no change in SKIV2L expression was observed (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that SKIV2L is not an IFN-induced gene. We also investigated whether SKIV2L can induce IFN. Although IFN-β induction was observed when HepG2 cells were transfected with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), no induction was observed with SKIV2L overexpression (Fig. 2B). IFN-I and IFN-III have been shown to induce Janus kinase (JAK) signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling, leading to the activation of interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter activity (26Zhou Z. Hamming O.J. Ank N. Paludan S.R. Nielsen A.L. Hartmann R. et al.Type III interferon (IFN) induces a type I IFN-like response in a restricted subset of cells through signaling pathways involving both the Jak-STAT pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinases.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 7749-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). IFN-α treatment significantly induced ISRE-promoter activity (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2C). However, neither HBV nor SKIV2L activated ISRE-promoter activity (p > 0.05) (Fig. 2D). We extended this analysis by using SNC-IR cells, a subclone (derived from HCV subgenomic replicon cells SNC#2; Ref. 27Murata T. Ohshima T. Yamaji M. Hosaka M. Miyanari Y. Hijikata M. Shimotohno K. et al.Suppression of hepatitis C virus replicon by TGF-β.Virology. 2005; 331: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that is resistant to IFN due to the lack of IFNAR2 expression (Fig. 2E). SNC-IR cells were cured of HCV by treatment with cyclosporine A (SNC-IRC cells) and used for analysis of the SKIV2L effect on HBV replication. Transfection with SKIV2L significantly suppressed HBV replication in SNC-IRC cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2F). SKIV2L encodes a RNA helicase (28Dangel A.W. Shen L. Mendoza A.R. Wu L.C. Yu C.Y. et al.Human helicase gene SKI2W in the HLA class III region exhibits striking structural similarities to the yeast antiviral gene SKI2 and to the human gene KIAA0052: emergence of a new gene family.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2120-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that SKIV2L-induced HBV suppression might be mediated through SKIV2L interaction with one or more HBV RNAs. Notably, the HBV genome encodes at least five primary mRNA transcripts. To investigate a possible interaction between SKIV2L and any of the HBV RNAs, we co-transfected HepG2 hepatoma cells with a SKIV2L-Myc construct together with HBV-D60 and performed RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments (Fig. 3A) (the SKIV2L-Myc construct encodes a Myc-tagged SKIV2L protein, permitting use of anti-Myc antibody for immunoprecipitation of the helicase and bound transcripts). To exclude nonspecific interactions of the Myc antibody used for RIP, or HBV-RNAs with the purified protein, we performed another RIP experiment with anti-Myc antibody after transfecting HepG2cells with a plasmid expressing another Myc-tagged protein (TSSK2-Myc) together with HBV-D60 (Fig. 3B). We used two sets of primers to quantify HBV-mRNA transcripts by real-time RT-PCR analysis. One set was designed to amplify a sequence (nt 64–357) shared by HBV precore, pre-genomic, pre-S1, and pre-S2 mRNA transcripts; the other set of primers was designed to amplify another sequence (nt 1386–1625) shared by HBV X-mRNA and the above-mentioned 4 transcripts (Fig. 3A) (nucleotide numbering is based on the HBV-D_IND60 sequence, GenBankTM accession number AB246347.1 (29Sugiyama M. Tanaka Y. Kato T. Orito E. Ito K. Acharya S.K. Gish R.G. Kramvis A. Shimada T. Izumi N. Kaito M. Miyakawa Y. Mizokami M. et al.Influence of hepatitis B virus genotypes on the intra- and extracellular expression of viral DNA and antigens.Hepatology. 2006; 44: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We compared the abundance of RNA transcripts containing the nt 1386–1625 or nt 64–357 sequences in the Myc antibody-precipitated samples to the original levels of the same transcripts in the input samples by real-time RT-PCR using the ΔΔCT method in which the host GAPDH, mRNAs titers in both the input and the Myc antibody-precipitated samples, were used as endogenous controls. RNA transcripts containing the nt 1386–1625 or nt 64–357 sequences were found to be enriched >10-fold or 2-fold, respectively, in the Myc antibody-precipitated samples from SKIV2L-Myc (Fig. 3C, lower panel) but not TSSK2-Myc transfected cells (Fig. 3C, upper panel). The output samples pulled down by the control isotype antibody (mouse IgG) did not show a significant change in HBV RNA titers relative to those of GAPDH mRNAs (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that (in general) HBV RNA transcripts are bound at higher levels by SKIV2L than are other cellular mRNAs like those encoding GAPDH (Fig. 3, B and C). Notably, the HBV-X transcript containing nt 1386–1625 (but not that containing nt 64–357) showed higher (1-log) preferential interaction with SKIV2L helicase (Fig. 3C, lower panel). SKIV2L is thought to deliver RNA substrates to the catalytic core of the RNA exosome (30Schneider C. Tollervey D. et al.Threading the barrel of the RNA exosome.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 485-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated the association of HBV X-mRNA with the RNA exosome complex. Because the RIP assay previously has been reported to identify RNAs associated with the RNA exosome (31Shin J.H. Wang H.L. Lee J. Dinwiddie B.L. Belostotsky D.A. Chekanova J.A. et al.The role of the Arabidopsis Exosome in siRNA-independent silencing of heterochromatic loci.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003411Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we pulled down either EXOSC4 (Fig. 4A) or EXOSC5 (Fig. 4B) proteins (known components of the RNA exosome) and studied their association with HBV X-mRNA. For efficient production of detectable quantities of the HBV-X transcript, we cloned a sequence corresponding to the HBV X-mRNA sequence (nt 1237–1933); nucleotide numbering is based on the HBV-D_IND60 sequence (GenBankTM accession number AB246347.1) lacking the X promoter region along with a 12-nt tail after the poly(A) signal (TATAAA)) into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid; this construct (pcDNA3.1-X) placed the inserted sequence under control of the CMV promoter. pcDNA3.1-X was used to study the HBV X-mRNA interaction with two different RNA exosome proteins; we performed the assay with the two different proteins to avoid possible protein-specific interactions. Although siRNA silencing of SKIV2L yielded increased HBV X-mRNA titers (Fig. 4, C (p < 0.05) and D (p < 0.05)), the RIP assay showed that silencing of SKIV2L suppressed HBV X-mRNA interaction with RNA exosome components EXOSC4 (Fig. 4E) and EXOSC5 (Fig. 4F). These results show that SKIV2L is required for the HBV X-mRNA/RNA exosome interaction. We further performed an intracellular localization of the interaction between SKIV2L and the RNA exosome complex. Cytoplasmic interaction between SKIV2L and EXOSC4 or between SKIV2L and EXOSC5 was demonstrated both by co-localization (Fig. 5, A and B) and by proximity ligation assay (Fig. 5C) using immunofluorescence analysis. These data suggest that the cytoplasm is the site for the interaction of these components and the subsequent HBV X-mRNA degradation.FIGURE 5.Intracellular localization of SKIV2L/RNA exosome interaction. HuH-7 cells were transfected with pEF4-SKIV2L-MycHis in combination with either pEF-BOS-EXOSC4-FLAG (A) or pEF-BOS-EXOSC5-FLAG plasmids (B). Intracellular localization of SKIV2L-Myc and EXOSC4-FLAG or EXOSC5-FLAG proteins was visualized by immunofluorescence analysis using rabbit anti-SKIV2L and mouse anti-FLAG antibodies. The left panels show the nuclear staining with DAPI (blue). EXOSC4-FLAG and EXOSC5-FLAG intracellular expression was detected by Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (green). SKIV2L intracellular expression was detected using Alexa 555-conjugated secondary antibody (red). The right panels show a merged images of EXOSC4 or 5 (green) with SKIV2L (red) staining C, proximity ligation assay showing the interaction between SKIV2L and EXOSC4 (panel C3) and between SKIV2L and EXOSC5 (panel C4) proteins as red dots. Panels C1 and C2 show the staining observed with combinations of isotype control antibodies; the lack of red staining in these panels confirms that the assay does not detect nonspecific binding. As a control for a nonspecific interaction between over-expressed proteins at the PLA assay, panel C5 shows the nuclear expression of the overexpressed Halo tagged DDX5 helicase using mouse anti-Halo antibody, whereas panel C6 shows no interaction between DDX5 and EXOSC4 protein in PLA assay as evident by the lack of the red dots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RNA quality control mechanisms are known to utilize the SKIV2L-RNA exosome system for the degradation of aberrant RNA and can be classified into UPF1-dependent (NMD) or HBS1L-dependent (NSD and No-Go RNA decay) mechanisms (13Rigby R.E. Rehwinkel J. et al.RNA degradation in antiviral immunity and autoimmunity.Trends Immunol. 2015; 36: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the effect of either UPF1 or HBS1L on SKIV2L-mediated suppression of HBV X-mRNA. SKIV2L overexpression yielded a significant decrease in HBV X-mRNA titers (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6A). Silencing of UPF1 did not alter this suppression; however, silencing of HBS1L restored HBV X-mRNA titers to levels statistically indistinguishable (p > 0.05) from those seen in the absence of SKIV2L overexpression (Fig. 6A). HBS1L and UPF1 siRNA knockdown efficiency is shown (Fig. 6B). Similarly, EXOSC4 and -5 interaction with HBV X-mRNA was significantly reduced (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) when HBS1L expression was silenced by the inclusion of a HBS1L-specific siRNA (Fig. 6, C and D). These data suggest that the mechanism of RNA exosome-mediated interaction with (and suppression of) HBV X-mRNA is HBS1L-dependent. Because the interaction of HBV X-mRNA with the RNA exosome may eventually lead to its degradation, we investigated the effect of SKIV2L, HBS1L, and RNA exosome on the stability of HBV X-mRNA. The central channel of the RNA exosome is formed by six evolutionary conserved subunits, including EXOSC4 and EXOSC5. Deletion of any of these proteins has been shown to significantly affect RNA exosome structure and assembly (32Estévez A.M. Lehner B. Sanderson C.M. Ruppert T. Clayton C. et al.The roles of intersubunit interactions in exosome stability.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34943-34951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). De novo RNA transcription was stopped by actinomycin D treatment, and HBV X-mRNA decay overtime was detected by Northern blot analysis. In our hands silencing of either EXOSC4 or EXOSC5 expression stabilized HBV X-mRNA at 8 h after actinomycin D treatment, confirming the role of the RNA exosome in HBV X-mRNA degradation. This effect also was seen with silencing of SKIV2L and HBS1L expression, showing involvement of the products of these genes in HBV X-mRNA decay (Fig. 7, A and B). EXOSC4 and -5 siRNA knockdown efficiency is shown (Fig. 7C). Because mRNA decay by the SKIV2L-activated RNA exosome occurs via a nonsense (3′-end)-mediated decay process, we thus conclude that HBV X-mRNA decay is a 3′-end process that is dependent on HBS1L, SKIV2L, and the RNA exosome.FIGURE 7.Silencing of genes encoding SKIV2L, HBS1L, or exosome complex proteins increases the stability of HBV X mRNA. A, two different experiments (Exp. 1 and Exp. 2) in which HepG2 cells were transfected with nonspecific siRNA (si-NS), si-SKIV2L, si-HBS1L, si-EXOSC4, and si-EXOSC5 as indicated, and 24 h later, cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-X. After 48 h the cells were treated with actinomycin D (8 μg/ml).

However, the molecular mechanisms targeting ING3 to histones and the role of this interaction in the cell remain elusive. Thus, we employed biochemical and structural biology approaches to investigate the interaction of the ING3 PHD finger (ING3PHD) with the active transcription mark H3K4me3.

Forty children with SS-Sβ° (mean age 8 years) underwent neurocognitive evaluation and comprehensive brain imaging assessment with TCD, MRI, MRA, Resting State (RS) Functional MRI with evaluation of the Default Mode Network (DMN). Sixteen healthy age-matched controls underwent MRI, MRA and RS functional MRI.Children with SCD display increased brain connectivity in the DMN even in the absence of alterations in standard imaging techniques. Patients with low neurocognitive scores presented higher brain connectivity compared to children without cognitive impairment or controls, suggesting an initial compensatory mechanism to maintain performances. In our cohort steady state haemoglobin level was not related to increased brain connectivity, but SatO2<97% was. Our findings provide novel evidence that SCD is characterized by a selective disruption of connectivity among relevant regions of the brain, potentially leading to reduced cognition and altered functional brain dynamics. RS functional MRI could be used as a useful tool to evaluate cognition and cerebral damage in SCD in longitudinal trials."
https://openalex.org/W2411787906,"Reproductive division of labor is one of the defining traits of honey bees (Apis mellifera), with non-reproductive tasks being performed by workers while a single queen normally monopolizes reproduction. The decentralized organization of a honey bee colony is maintained in large part by a bouquet of queen-produced pheromones, the distribution of which is facilitated by contact among workers throughout the hive. Previous studies have shown that the developmental fate of honey bee queens is highly plastic, with queens raised from younger worker larvae exhibiting higher measures of reproductive potential compared to queens raised from older worker larvae. We investigated differences in the chemical composition of the mandibular glands and attractiveness to workers of ""high-quality"" queens (i.e., raised from first instar worker larvae; more queen-like) and ""low-quality"" queens (i.e., raised from third instar worker larvae; more worker-like). We characterized the chemical profiles of the mandibular glands of high-quality queens and low-quality queens using GC-MS and used the worker retinue response as a measure of the attractiveness to workers of high-quality queens vs. low-quality queens. We found that queen quality affected the chemical profiles of mandibular gland contents differently across years, showing significant differences in the production of the queen mandibular pheromone (""QMP"") components HVA and 9-HDA in 2010, but no significant differences of any glandular compound in 2012. We also found that workers were significantly more attracted to high-quality queens than to low-quality queens in 2012, possibly because of increased attractiveness of their mandibular gland chemical profiles. Our results indicate that the age at which honey bee larvae enter the ""queen-specific"" developmental pathway influences the chemical composition of queen mandibular glands and worker behavior. However, these changes are not consistent across years, suggesting that other external factors may play important roles in modulating queen quality."
https://openalex.org/W2418193467,"Zebrafish epilepsy models are emerging tools in experimental epilepsy. Zebrafish larvae, in particular, are advantageous because they can be easily genetically altered and used for developmental and drug studies since agents applied to the bath penetrate the organism easily. Methods for electrophysiological recordings in zebrafish are new and evolving. We present a novel multi-electrode array method to non-invasively record electrical activity from up to 61 locations of an intact larval zebrafish head. This method enables transcranial noninvasive recording of extracellular field potentials (which include multi-unit activity and EEG) to identify epileptic seizures. To record from the brains of zebrafish larvae, the dorsum of the head of an intact larva was secured onto a multi-electrode array. We recorded from individual electrodes for at least three hours and quantified neuronal firing frequency, spike patterns (continuous or bursting), and synchrony of neuronal firing. Following 15 mM potassium chloride- or pentylenetetrazole-infusion into the bath, spike and burst rate increased significantly. Additionally, synchrony of neuronal firing across channels, a hallmark of epileptic seizures, also increased. Notably, the fish survived the experiment. This non-invasive method complements present invasive zebrafish neurophysiological techniques: it affords the advantages of high spatial and temporal resolution, a capacity to measure multiregional activity and neuronal synchrony in seizures, and fish survival for future experiments, such as studies of epileptogenesis and development."

https://openalex.org/W2409830199,"Stathmin is a prominent destabilizer of microtubules (MTs). Extensive in vitro studies have strongly suggested that stathmin could act by sequestering tubulin and/or by binding to MT tips. In cells, the molecular mechanisms of stathmin binding to tubulin and/or MTs and its implications for the MT dynamics remain unexplored. By using immunofluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we analyzed the ability of stathmin and its phosphorylated forms (on Ser16, −25, −38, and −63) to interact with tubulin and MTs in A549 cells. Consistent with in vitro studies, we detected stathmin–tubulin interactions at the MT plus ends and in the cytosol. Of interest, we also observed a novel pool of stathmin bound along the MT. Expression of truncated stathmin and use of MT-stabilizing taxol further showed that the C-terminal domain of stathmin is the main contributor to this binding and that the phosphorylation state of stathmin plays a role in its binding along the MT wall. Our findings demonstrate that stathmin binds directly along the MT wall. This pool of stathmin would be readily available to participate in protofilament dissociation when the moving plus end of a depolymerizing MT reaches stathmin molecules.—Nouar, R., Breuzard, G., Bastonero, S., Gorokhova, S., Barbier, P., Devred, F., Kovacic, H., Peyrot, V.

https://openalex.org/W2413638197,"The ability to follow one another's gaze plays an important role in our social cognition; especially when we synchronously perform tasks together. We investigate how gaze cues can improve performance in a simple coordination task (i.e., the mirror game), whereby two players mirror each other's hand motions. In this game, each player is either a leader or follower. To study the effect of gaze in a systematic manner, the leader's role is played by a robotic avatar. We contrast two conditions, in which the avatar provides or not explicit gaze cues that indicate the next location of its hand. Specifically, we investigated (a) whether participants are able to exploit these gaze cues to improve their coordination, (b) how gaze cues affect action prediction and temporal coordination, and (c) whether introducing active gaze behavior for avatars makes them more realistic and human-like (from the user point of view).43 subjects participated in 8 trials of the mirror game. Each subject performed the game in the two conditions (with and without gaze cues). In this within-subject study, the order of the conditions was randomized across participants, and subjective assessment of the avatar's realism was assessed by administering a post-hoc questionnaire. When gaze cues were provided, a quantitative assessment of synchrony between participants and the avatar revealed a significant improvement in subject reaction-time (RT). This confirms our hypothesis that gaze cues improve the follower's ability to predict the avatar's action. An analysis of the pattern of frequency across the two players' hand movements reveals that the gaze cues improve the overall temporal coordination across the two players. Finally, analysis of the subjective evaluations from the questionnaires reveals that, in the presence of gaze cues, participants found it not only more human-like/realistic, but also easier to interact with the avatar.This work confirms that people can exploit gaze cues to predict another person's movements and to better coordinate their motions with their partners, even when the partner is a computer-animated avatar. Moreover, this study contributes further evidence that implementing biological features, here task-relevant gaze cues, enable the humanoid robotic avatar to appear more human-like, and thus increase the user's sense of affiliation."
https://openalex.org/W2418044918,"ATP-binding cassette C11 (ABCC11) is a plasma membrane protein involved in the transport of a variety of lipophilic anions. ABCC11 wild-type is responsible for the high-secretion phenotypes in human apocrine glands, such as that of wet-type ear wax, and the risk of axillary osmidrosis. We have previously reported that mature ABCC11 is a glycoprotein containing two N-linked glycans at Asn838 and Asn844. However, little is known about the role of N-linked glycosylation in the regulation of ABCC11 protein. In the current study, we investigated the effects of N-linked glycosylation on the protein level and localization of ABCC11 using polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells. When the N-linked glycosylation in ABCC11-expressing cells was chemically inhibited by tunicamycin treatment, the maturation of ABCC11 was suppressed and its protein level was significantly decreased. Immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that the protein level of the N-linked glycosylation-deficient mutant (N838Q and N844Q: Q838/844) was about half of the ABCC11 wild-type level. Further biochemical studies with the Q838/844 mutant showed that this glycosylation-deficient ABCC11 was degraded faster than wild-type probably due to the enhancement of the MG132-sensitive protein degradation pathway. Moreover, the incubation of ABCC11 wild-type-expressing cells in a low-glucose condition decreased mature, glycosylated ABCC11, compared with the high-glucose condition. On the other hand, the protein level of the Q838/844 mutant was not affected by glucose condition. These results suggest that N-linked glycosylation is important for the protein stability of ABCC11, and physiological alteration in glucose may affect the ABCC11 protein level and ABCC11-related phenotypes in humans, such as axillary osmidrosis."

https://openalex.org/W2411662359,"Hypoxic conditions in the cornea affect epithelial function by activating Polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3) signaling and the c-Jun·AP-1 transcription complex, resulting in apoptosis of corneal epithelial cells. Hypoxic stress in the culture conditions also regulates limbal stem cell growth and fate. In this study, we demonstrate that there is a differential response of Plk3 in hypoxic stress-induced primary human limbal stem (HLS) and corneal epithelial (HCE) cells, resulting in different pathways of cell fate. We found that hypoxic stress induced HLS cell differentiation by down-regulating Plk3 activity at the transcription level, which was opposite to the effect of hypoxic stress on Plk3 activation to elicit HCE cell apoptosis, detected by DNA fragmentation and TUNEL assays. Hypoxic stress-induced increases in c-Jun phosphorylation/activation were not observed in HLS cells because Plk3 expression and activity were suppressed in hypoxia-induced HLS cells. Instead, hypoxic stress-induced HLS cell differentiation was monitored by cell cycle analysis and measured by the decrease and increase in p63 and keratin 12 expression, respectively. Hypoxic stress-induced Plk3 signaling to regulate c-Jun activity, resulting in limbal stem cell differentiation and center epithelial apoptosis, was also found in the corneas of wild-type and Plk3(-/-)-deficient mice. Our results, for the first time, reveal the differential effects of hypoxic stress on Plk3 activity in HLS and HCE cells. Instead of apoptosis, hypoxic stress suppresses Plk3 activity to protect limbal stem cells from death and to allow the process of HLS cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2415295694,"Mutations in the gene encoding parkin, an auto-inhibited E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions in the clearance of damaged mitochondria, are the most common cause of autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism. The mechanism regulating parkin activation remains poorly understood. Here we show, by using isothermal titration calorimetry, solution NMR, and fluorescence spectroscopy, that parkin can bind ubiquitin and phosphomimetic ubiquitin by recognizing the canonical hydrophobic patch and C terminus of ubiquitin. The affinity of parkin for both phosphomimetic and unmodified ubiquitin is markedly enhanced upon removal of the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain of parkin. This suggests that the agonistic binding of ubiquitin to parkin in trans is counterbalanced by the antagonistic activity of the parkin UBL domain in cis. Intriguingly, UBL binding is enthalpy-driven, whereas ubiquitin binding is driven by an increase in the total entropy of the system. These thermodynamic differences are explained by different chemistry in the ubiquitin- and UBL-binding pockets of parkin and, as shown by molecular dynamics simulations, are not a consequence of changes in protein conformational entropy. Indeed, comparison of conformational fluctuations reveals that the RING1-IBR element becomes considerably more rigid upon complex formation. A model of parkin activation is proposed in which E2∼Ub binding triggers large scale diffusional motion of the RING2 domain toward the ubiquitin-stabilized RING1-IBR assembly to complete formation of the active parkin-E2∼Ub transfer complex. Thus, ubiquitin plays a dual role in parkin activation by competing with the inhibitory UBL domain and stabilizing the active form of parkin."

https://openalex.org/W2416139869,"To identify patterns of stability and change in co-occurrence in children between 5-11 years, and to assess if they vary by socio-demographic factors.Data from 9548 singleton children from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) were assessed for co-occurrence of five common adverse conditions: wheeze; longstanding illness; unfavorable weight; injury; and socio-emotional difficulties. We summed adverse conditions (0-5) for each child at ages 5, 7, and 11 and identified co-occurrence (≥2 conditions). Using multinomial regression, we explored associations between co-occurrence trajectories and child's sex and ethnicity, maternal education, and income quintile.45.6% of children experienced co-occurrence between 5-11 years (7% experienced constant co-occurrence). More children moved into co-occurrence than moved out (16.9 vs. 11.9%). Mutually-adjusted relative risk ratios (aRRR) showed a gradient by maternal education: compared to children with no co-occurrence whose mothers had a higher/degree, children whose mothers had no qualifications were more likely to move into (aRRR = 1.32(95%CI:1.02,1.70)), out of (1.74(1.34,2.26)), have fluctuating (1.52(1.09,2.10)) or constant co-occurrence (2.58(1.76,3.80)). The same gradient (high vs. low) was evident for income quintiles. Girls were less likely to experience co-occurrence.Co-occurrence of adverse conditions is common during childhood, and trajectories are socially patterned. Child-focused care for lower-income children and boys early in life may prevent and reduce co-occurrence in later childhood."

https://openalex.org/W2419387025,"Cell proliferation is driven by cyclical activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which produce distinct biochemical cell cycle phases. Mitosis (M phase) is orchestrated by CDK-1, complexed with mitotic cyclins. During M phase, chromosomes are segregated by a bipolar array of microtubules called the mitotic spindle. The essential bipolarity of the mitotic spindle is established by the kinesin-5 Eg5, but factors influencing the maintenance of spindle bipolarity are not fully understood. Here, we describe an unexpected link between inhibiting CDK-1 before mitosis and bipolar spindle maintenance. Spindles in human RPE-1 cells normally collapse to monopolar structures when Eg5 is inhibited at metaphase. However, we found that inhibition of CDK-1 in the G2 phase of the cell cycle improved the ability of RPE-1 cells to maintain spindle bipolarity without Eg5 activity in the mitosis immediately after release from CDK-1 inhibition. This improved bipolarity maintenance correlated with an increase in the stability of kinetochore-microtubules, the subset of microtubules that link chromosomes to the spindle. The improvement in bipolarity maintenance after CDK-1 inhibition in G2 required both the kinesin-12 Kif15 and increased stability of kinetochore-microtubules. Consistent with increased kinetochore-microtubule stability, we find that inhibition of CDK-1 in G2 impairs mitotic fidelity by increasing the incidence of lagging chromosomes in anaphase. These results suggest that inhibition of CDK-1 in G2 causes unpredicted effects in mitosis, even after CDK-1 inhibition is relieved."
https://openalex.org/W2418877528,"Age, gender, diet, gene and lifestyle have been reported to affect metabolic status and disease susceptibility through epigenetic pathway. But it remains indistinct that which factors account for certain epigenetic modifications. Our aim was to identify the influencing factors on inter-individual DNA methylation variations of carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) and global genome in peripheral blood leucocytes (PBLs). ChREBP DNA methylation was determined by bisulfite sequencing, and genomic 5mdC contents were quantified by capillary hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography/ in-source fragmentation/ tandem mass spectrometry system in about 300 healthy individuals. Eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning ChREBP and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) were genotyped by high resolution melting or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. DNMT1 mRNA expression was analyzed by quantitative PCR. We found ChREBP DNA methylation levels were statistically associated with age (Beta (B) = 0.028, p = 0.006) and serum total cholesterol concentrations (TC) (B = 0.815, p = 0.010), independent of sex, concentrations of triglyceride, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting blood glucose and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, PBLs counts and classifications. The DNMT1 haplotypes were related to ChREBP (odds ratio (OR) = 0.668, p = 0.029) and global (OR = 0.450, p = 0.015) DNA methylation as well as LDL-C, but not DNMT1 expression. However, only the relation to LDL-C was robust to correction for multiple testing (ORFDR = 1.593, pFDR = 0.013). These results indicated that the age and TC were independent influential factors of ChREBP methylation and DNMT1 variants could probably influence LDL-C to further modify ChREBP DNA methylation. Certainly, sequential comprehensive analysis of the interactions between genetic variants and blood lipid levels on ChREBP and global DNA methylation was required."
