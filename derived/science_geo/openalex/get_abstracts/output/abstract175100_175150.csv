Visualization of these processes has previously been limited to in vitro systems. We describe the use of two-photon laser microscopy to image the dynamic behavior of individual living lymphocytes deep within intact lymph nodes. In their native environment, T cells achieved peak velocities of more than 25 micrometers per minute, displaying a motility coefficient that is five to six times that of B cells. Antigenic challenge changed T cell trajectories from random walks to ""swarms"" and stable clusters. Real-time two-photon imaging reveals lymphocyte behaviors that are fundamental to the initiation of the immune response."

Three members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of channels are expressed in subsets of these neurons and are activated at distinct physiological temperatures. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel thermosensitive TRP channel. TRPV3 has a unique threshold: It is activated at innocuous (warm) temperatures and shows an increased response at noxious temperatures. TRPV3 is specifically expressed in keratinocytes; hence, skin cells are capable of detecting heat via molecules similar to those in heat-sensing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2095955574,"Calcium-activated nonselective (CAN) cation channels are expressed in various excitable and nonexcitable cells supporting important cellular responses such as neuronal bursting activity, fluid secretion, and cardiac rhythmicity. We have cloned and characterized a second form of TRPM4, TRPM4b, a member of the TRP channel family, as a molecular candidate of a CAN channel. TRPM4b encodes a cation channel of 25 pS unitary conductance that is directly activated by [Ca2+]i with an apparent K(D) of approximately 400 nM. It conducts monovalent cations such as Na+ and K+ without significant permeation of Ca2+. TRPM4b is activated following receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization, representing a regulatory mechanism that controls the magnitude of Ca2+ influx by modulating the membrane potential and, with it, the driving force for Ca2+ entry through other Ca2+-permeable pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2011539791,"Ceramics based on Si(3)N(4) have been comprehensively studied and are widely used in structural applications. The development of an interlocking microstructure of elongated grains is vital to ensure that this family of ceramics have good damage tolerance. Until now this has been accomplished by heating the appropriate powder compacts to temperatures above 1,700 degrees C for extended periods. This procedure involves a necessary step of controlling the size and population of seeds added ex situ or formed in situ to ensure selective grain growth. Here we report the very fast (within minutes) in situ formation of a tough interlocking microstructure in Si(3)N(4)-based ceramics. The microstructures are obtained by a dynamic ripening mechanism, an anisotropic Ostwald ripening process that results from the rapid heating rate. The resulting microstructures are uniform and reproducible in terms of grain size distribution and mechanical properties, and are easily tailored by manipulating the kinetics. This process is very efficient and opens up new possibilities to optimize mechanical properties and cost-effectively manufacture ceramics."

https://openalex.org/W1968137237,"Planar cell polarity signaling in Drosophila requires the receptor Frizzled and the cytoplasmic proteins Dishevelled and Prickle. From initial, symmetric subcellular distributions in pupal wing cells, Frizzled and Dishevelled become highly enriched at the distal portion of the cell cortex. We describe a Prickle-dependent intercellular feedback loop that generates asymmetric Frizzled and Dishevelled localization. In the absence of Prickle, Frizzled and Dishevelled remain symmetrically distributed. Prickle localizes to the proximal side of pupal wing cells and binds the Dishevelled DEP domain, inhibiting Dishevelled membrane localization and antagonizing Frizzled accumulation. This activity is linked to Frizzled activity on the adjacent cell surface. Prickle therefore functions in a feedback loop that amplifies differences between Frizzled levels on adjacent cell surfaces."

Escherichia coli Dps, a structural analog of the 12-subunit Listeria innocua ferritin, binds and protects DNA against oxidative damage mediated by H2O2. Dps is shown to be a Fe-binding and storage protein where Fe(II) oxidation is most effectively accomplished by H2O2 rather than by O2 as in ferritins. Two Fe2+ ions bind at each of the 12 putative dinuclear ferroxidase sites (PZ) in the protein according to the equation, 2Fe2+ + PZ→ [(Fe(II)2-P]FSZ+2+ 2H+. The ferroxidase site (FS) bound iron is then oxidized according to the equation, [(Fe(II)2-P]FSZ+2+ H2O2 + H2O → [Fe(III)2O2(OH)-P]FSZ−1+ 3H+, where two Fe(II) are oxidized per H2O2 reduced, thus avoiding hydroxyl radical production through Fenton chemistry. Dps acquires a ferric core of ∼500 Fe(III) according to the mineralization equation, 2Fe2+ + H2O2 + 2H2O → 2Fe(III)OOH(core) + 4H+, again with a 2 Fe(II)/H2O2 stoichiometry. The protein forms a similar ferric core with O2 as the oxidant, albeit at a slower rate. In the absence of H2O2 and O2, Dps forms a ferrous core of ∼400 Fe(II) by the reaction Fe2+ + H2O + Cl− → Fe(II)OHCl(core) + H+. The ferrous core also undergoes oxidation with a stoichiometry of 2 Fe(II)/H2O2. Spin trapping experiments demonstrate that Dps greatly attenuates hydroxyl radical production during Fe(II) oxidation by H2O2. These results and in vitro DNA damage assays indicate that the protective effect of Dps on DNA most likely is exerted through a dual action, the physical association with DNA and the ability to nullify the toxic combination of Fe(II) and H2O2. In the latter process a hydrous ferric oxide mineral core is produced within the protein, thus avoiding oxidative damage mediated by Fenton chemistry.

DNA-binding protein from starved cells diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid 5-ethoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid All aerobic organisms have evolved a variety of complex defense and repair mechanisms to protect their DNA from oxidative damage because of reactive oxygen species such as HO·, O2⨪, and H2O2. These include highly regulated enzymatic systems that recognize and repair damaged DNA or that prevent damage by detoxifying the reactants that produce radicals (1Martinez A. Kolter R. J.

These inducible responses are associated with de novo protein synthesis, an energy requiring process. However, when bacteria are starved, their ability to cope with environmental assault by de novo protein synthesis becomes compromised by the lack of nutrients (1Martinez A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5188-5194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A class of nonspecific DNA-binding Dps1 (pexB) proteins is expressed in bacteria and accumulated to high levels prior to conditions of oxidative or nutritional stress, making the cell in stationary phase more resistant to H2O2 than actively growing cells (1Martinez A.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the protective activity of Dps may stem from its ability to sequester iron ions, but direct experimental evidence for this proposal has been lacking (1Martinez A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5188-5194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct.

Dps has a shell-like structure of 3:2 tetrahedral symmetry assembled from 12 identical subunits with a central cavity measuring ∼45 Å in diameter (7Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Each Dps subunit is folded into a 4-helix bundle through hydrophobic interactions. The 3:2 symmetry of the assembled protein leads to two inequivalent environments along the 3-fold axes. One corresponds to the 3-fold interactions found in the 24-mer ferritins having 4:3:2 octahedral symmetry and involves the N-terminal end of the subunit, whereas the other 3-fold interaction takes place at the C-terminal end of Dps but is not typical of the ferritins (7Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli Dps and the relatively recently discovered 12-mer Listeria innocua ferritin assemble in essentially the same way but share only 19% identity in primary sequence (10Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsermoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 11Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C. Valenti P. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3259-3265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Both proteins possess a negative electrostatic potential on the inner surfaces of their shells, providing an ideal microenvironment for iron mineralization (7Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 10Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsermoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Unlike typical 24-mer ferritins, the putative dinuclear ferroxidase sites of L. innocua ferritin are not located in the four-helix bundle of individual monomers but rather have ligands provided by two symmetry-related subunits (10Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsermoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Most ligands comprising the putative ferroxidase center of L. innocuaferritin are conserved in E. coli Dps as well (7Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 10Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsermoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Pb2+is bound at this location in the heavy atom derivative of the Dps crystal (7Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The large “ferritin-like” 3-fold pores of 8 Å diameter are lined with Asp121, Asp126, and Asp130 from the three symmetry-related subunits and are conserved between the two proteins (except that Asp121 is replaced by Lys in Dps). The negatively charged hydrophilic pores are likely pathways for iron entry into the protein cavity (7Grant R.A. Filman D.J. Finkel S.E. Kolter R. Hogle J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 10Ilari A. Stefanini S. Chiancone E. Tsermoglou D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).L. innocua ferritin has been shown to exhibit ferroxidase activity (12Yang X. Chiancone E. Stefanini S. Ilari A. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Stefanini S. Cavallo S. Montagnini B. Chiancone E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 71-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can rapidly accumulate up to ∼500 iron atoms within its central cavity when O2 is the oxidant (11Bozzi M. Mignogna G. Stefanini S. Barra D. Longhi C. Valenti P. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3259-3265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The striking similarity in overall structure between E. coliDps and L. innocua ferritin and the protective effect ofE. coli Dps on DNA against oxidative damage mediated by Fenton chemistry (1Martinez A. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5188-5194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that E. coli Dps might also function as an iron-binding and storage protein. However, to date the iron binding, oxidation, and hydrolysis/mineralization reactions of Dps have not yet been investigated. In the present study, we describe experiments that demonstrate a ferritin-like function for Dps. Unexpectedly, O2 was found to be a relatively poor oxidant for Fe(II) in Dps, the rate of O2 consumption being only marginally faster than Fe(II) autoxidation in the absence of protein. In contrast to O2, H2O2causes rapid and complete oxidation of Fe(II). The initial rate of iron oxidation reaches a maximum at 24 Fe(II)/Dps, a result implying that there are 12 dinuclear ferroxidase sites in Dps, one per each of the 12 subunits. As in E. coli bacterioferritin and L. innocua ferritin (12Yang X. Chiancone E. Stefanini S. Ilari A. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the ferroxidase activity of Dps is not readily regenerated upon standing. A stoichiometry of 1 H2O2 per 2 Fe(II) oxidized is obtained in both ferroxidase and mineralization reactions of Dps, thus avoiding the production of the HO⋅ radical through the Fenton reaction as follows. Fe2++H2O2→Fe3++OH−+HO·,Equation 1 By using spectrophotometry, pH-stat, sedimentation velocity measurements, and iron analysis, the protein was shown to load up to ∼500 Fe(III) within its cavity. The results are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms of core formation in Dps and of the relationship between its ferritin-like function and DNA protection from oxidative damage. Preparation and purification of Dps were performed as described by Almiron et al. (6Almiron M. Link A.J. Furlong D. Kolter R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2646-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) with one modification. The Sephadex G-100 gel filtration step was replaced by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. At this low ionic strength Dps precipitates and can be collected easily after centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Dps resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2m NaCl, pH 8.0, was subjected to gel filtration on Sepharose 6B. ApoDps concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorptivity of 2.59 × 105m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm on a 12-mer protein basis (13Stefanini S. Cavallo S. Montagnini B. Chiancone E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 71-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of freshly prepared solutions of hydrogen peroxide was determined from the amount of O2 evolved upon addition of catalase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as measured by Clark electrode oximetry or from its absorbance at 240 nm (ε = 43.6 m−1cm−1) (15Zhao G. Bou-Abdallah F. Yang X. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). EMPO was purchased from Oxis Research (Portland, OR). All chemicals were reagent grade or better, and were used without further purification. The electrode oximetry/pH-stat apparatus and standardization reaction for its use have been described in detail elsewhere (14Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, the consumption of O2 during Fe(II) oxidation was followed at 25 °C by a Clark-type oxygen microelectrode while maintaining the pH at 7.0 with a pH-stat. To accurately measure initial rates of proton production, a pH-stat proportional band setting of 0.1 was used; however, the rapid response of pH-stat at this setting resulted in an overshoot of the stoichiometric end point at the end of the reaction. Therefore, the stoichiometry was determined in a separate experiment using a proportional band setting of 0.2 or 0.5 where the response of pH-stat was slower and an accurate end point could be obtained. Typical conditions for the experiments were 0.1, 0.2, 1, 2, or 4 μm Dps protein in 0.5 mm Mops and 150 or 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.0 (controlled by pH-stat), with increments of 6–24 or 100–1000 Fe(II) per protein added at 25 °C as freshly prepared 10–20 mm FeSO4 or Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (Baker Scientific) in pH 3.5 water. The use of 0.5 mm Mops buffer in the protein solution lends stability to the pH-stat control without significantly buffering the solution. Small corrections for free acid in the ferrous sulfate were made in all calculations. The ultraviolet-visible difference spectrophotometric titration and kinetic experiments of Fe(II) oxidation by H2O2 were performed on a Cary 500 spectrophotometer. The instrument was zeroed using 0.1 or 0.5 μm Dps solution as the blank. Time-dependent absorbance kinetic traces at 25 °C were collected using the Cary 500 kinetic Software. The kinetic data were further analyzed with Origin 6.0 software (Microcal Inc.). The initial rates of Fe(II) binding measured by the pH-stat and of Fe(II) oxidation measured by UV absorption spectroscopy were obtained from the linear A1term of third-order polynomial curve to the experimental data, namelyY = A 0 +A 1 t +A 2 t 2 +A 3 t 3, where the derivative dY/dt =A 1+2A 2 t + 3A 3 t 2 evaluated att = 0 gives A 1 = (dY/dt)0. Here Y is either the change in absorbance ΔA at 305 nm or the amount of NaOH autotitrated into the sample solution at time t in seconds (16Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded on a laboratory assembled EPR spectrometer based on a Bruker ER 041 XK-H X-band microwave bridge operating at 9.24 GHz with 100 kHz field modulation. Samples in 1-mm inner diameter quartz capillaries were placed in a Varian TE102 cavity for measurement at room temperature. Typical spectrometer parameters were: microwave power, 5.0 mW; modulation amplitude, 0.8 G; time constant, 0.3; scan rate, 7.14 G s−1. In the EMPO spin trapping experiments for hydroxyl radical (17Zhang H. Joseph J. Vasquez-Vivar J. Karoui H. Nsanzumuhire C. Martásek P. Tordo P. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), all spectra were recorded ∼1 min after addition of the last reagent. The concentrations of reactants are indicated in the figure captions. To prepare the ferric core of Dps using H2O2 as the oxidant, 500 Fe(II) (as 12.5 mm FeSO4) were added aerobically to 0.25 μm apoDps in 50 mmMops, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7, in 10 increments of 50 Fe(II)/Dps followed by 1 H2O2 (as a 12.5 mmsolution) per 2 Fe(II) 2 min later with a 10-min interval between iron additions. The protein solution was stirred only during the additions of Fe(II) and H2O2. The holoprotein prepared in this way was dialyzed three times against buffer and then analyzed for protein content by the Advanced Protein Assay (cytoskeleton.com) and the iron content by the ferrozine method (18Percival M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10058-10061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare the ferrous core of Dps, Fe(II) was added in 8 increments of 50 Fe(II)/Dps at 10-min intervals under an argon atmosphere and in the presence of 1 mm dithionite, Na2S2O4, in 50 mm Mops, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, to give a total of 400 Fe(II)/protein. The iron(II) containing protein was ultrafiltered 3 times under argon with a 1000-fold total volume change and analyzed for protein and iron contents. Formation of a ferric core with O2 as oxidant was assessed by adding two increments of 200 Fe(II)/Dps to Dps solutions (1 μm) equilibrated in air at 20 °C. Ferrous ammonium sulfate solutions prepared in Thunberg tubes and kept under nitrogen were used. The iron incorporation reaction was followed at 310 nm; after reaching a constant absorbance (about 2 h) the samples were analyzed by sedimentation velocity. Sedimentation velocity studies were carried out using the absorbance optics on a Beckman XLI analytical ultracentrifuge. Experiments were conducted at 30,000 rpm and 20 °C at Dps concentrations between 0.25 and 1.0 μm. Radial absorbance scans were obtained at both 280 and 310 nm using the continuous scan mode to provide an effective radial resolution of 30 μm. The constant ratio of absorbance at 280 nm to that at 310 nm during the centrifugation run of the ferrous core sample confirmed that oxidation of the Fe(II) had not occurred. Sedimentation coefficient distributions, g(s*) were obtained using the linear least-squares algorithm (ls-g(s)) incorporated in Sedfit (version 8.3) (19Schuck P. Rossmanith P. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Sedimentation coefficients were interpreted using standard methods (20Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were measured on 4 μm Dps solutions in 50 mm Mops-NaOH, pH 7.0, containing 150 mmNaCl. The measurements were carried out at 25 °C in gas-tight cells under a nitrogen atmosphere using a Fluoromax fluorimeter (Spex Industry). In the titration experiments, anaerobic 0.01 mFeSO4 solutions were added in increments corresponding to 12, 24, 36, 48, and 100 Fe(II)/Dps. DNA protection from oxidative damage in vitro was assessed using pUHE21-2 plasmid DNA (3900 bp, 10 nm), purified by a Qiaprep spin plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The total volume reaction was 10 μl in 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5. Dps (3 μm) was allowed to interact with plasmid DNA for 10 min prior to introduction of FeSO4 (50 μm) and H2O2 (10 mm). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 or 30 min at room temperature; the reaction was stopped by incubation with 2% SDS at 85 °C for 5 min. Dps was extracted with phenol and plasmid DNA was resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and imaged by ImageMaster VDS (AmershamBiosciences). The anaerobic addition of Fe(II) to E. coli Dps produced no discernable change in the UV-visible spectrum, but resulted in significant quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence (Fig.1 A). It also resulted in a pH drop of the solution from the production of protons associated with Fe(II) binding to the protein. Therefore, a careful anaerobic titration of the protein with Fe(II) was carried out and proton production monitored by autotitration with the standard base, while maintaining the pH at 7.0 with the pH-stat apparatus. The initial rate of proton production as a function of the Fe(II)/Dps ratio is plotted ascurve a in Fig. 1 B where each data point represents a separate Dps sample to which a single addition of Fe(II) was made. The initial rate of H+ production reaches a maximum at 24 Fe(II)/Dps, indicating that there are 24 Fe(II)-binding sites on the protein, 2 per subunit (Fig. 1 B, curve a). The same result was obtained from the fluorescence titration data (Fig. 1 A). A H+/Fe(II) stoichiometry of 1.0 ± 0.13 (n = 3) was obtained (Fig.2, first 24 μm Fe(II) addition). A proton count of 1 H+/Fe(II) has been reported for Fe(II) binding to L. innocua ferritin also (12Yang X. Chiancone E. Stefanini S. Ilari A. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), however, the production of protons from Fe(II) binding to L. innocua ferritin as well as to E. coli bacterioferritin occurs in less than 2 s (the 50% response time of the electrode) (12Yang X. Chiancone E. Stefanini S. Ilari A. Chasteen N.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D.

We write the Fe2+ binding (phase I) reaction in Dps as 2Fe2++PZ→[Fe(II)2−P]FSZ+2+2H+Equation 2 where [Fe(II)2-PZ+2]FS represents a diFe(II)-protein complex at each of the 12 putative ferroxidase sites. Initial experiments on Fe(II) oxidation in Dps were carried out using O2 as the oxidant. Fig.3 shows that the rate of O2consumption monitored by electrode oximetry was slow when Fe(II) was added aerobically to the apoprotein, being only marginally faster than Fe(II) autoxidation in buffer alone. Dps contrasts with all known ferritins investigated to date, including L. innocuaferritin, where O2 is an efficient and rapid oxidant for Fe(II) (12Yang X. Chiancone E. Stefanini S. Ilari A.

For example, when compared on a subunit basis (2 Fe(II)/subunit) under the conditions in Fig. 3, Fe(II) oxidation in Dps consumes 1.2 × 10−2O2/subunit/min compared with 10 O2/subunit/min for human H-chain ferritin (16Yang X.

Furthermore, addition of 24 Fe(II)/Dps aerobically to a 0.5 μm protein sample caused a minimal absorbance change at 305 nm over a period of 7 min in contrast to ferritins where rapid Fe(II) oxidation by O2 leads to formation of μ-oxo-bridged Fe(III) species that absorb at this wavelength (14Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar,16Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A gradual increase in absorbance with Dps occurs over an extended time period, however. Experiments were subsequently undertaken to determine whether H2O2 might be a more efficient oxidant of Fe(II) in Dps than O2. Fig. 4shows the addition of 12 μm Fe(II) to anaerobic solution of 0.50 μm Dps. In the presence of air there was little change in absorbance; however, upon the addition of H2O2 to the solution (2 H2O2/Fe(II)), the absorbance quickly increased to 0.35 units (Fig. 4). With H2O2 as the oxidant under the conditions in Fig. 4, the specific rate of Fe(II) oxidation was 100-fold larger than for O2, 1.8 Fe/subunit/min versus 0.017 Fe/subunit/min, respectively. The molar absorptivity for the observed oxidation product was 29,200m−1 cm−1 per iron at 305 nm, which is almost 10-fold higher than previously observed for the ferritins (∼3000 m−1 cm−1 per Fe) (14Yang X., Le Brun N.E. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Chasteen N.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4915-4923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Yang X. Chen-Barrett Y. Arosio P. Chasteen N.D.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9743-9750Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). perhaps reflecting the presence of more than one μ-oxo bridge in the diFe(III) complex that was formed (see “Discussion”). Fig. 5 compares the difference spectrum (spectrum A) of Dps + Fe(II) + H2O2minus that of Dps + H2O2 with the difference spectrum (spectrum B) of Dps + H2O2 + Fe(II) minus that of Dps + H2O2. If Fe(II) was added to the protein prior to H2O2, the increase in absorbance was almost 2-fold larger, indicating more complete formation of the specific Fe(III) complex. Spectrum A was stable for ∼1.5 h but ultimately decayed to 73% of its original absorbance by 24 h and to 48% in 4 days, suggesting slow clearance of iron from the original site of binding. (After 24 h, spectrum B decayed to 93% of its original intensity.) In subsequent experiments, Fe(II) was always added to the Dps solution prior to H2O2 to achieve the maximum amount of the specific complex. To determine the stoichiometry of Fe(II) oxidation by H2O2, Dps containing 24 Fe(II)/protein was titrated with H2O2 (Fig.6, curve a). The initial rate of Fe(II) oxidation reached a maximum at a ratio H2O2/Fe(II) = 0.5, indicating that one H2O2 oxidizes two Fe(II). In contrast, when Fe(II) was added to a solution of H2O2 in the absence of Dps, an oxidation stoichiometry of 1 H2O2/Fe(II) was observed (data not shown) as expected for the Fenton reaction (Equation 1). The number of protons generated during Fe(II) oxidation by H2O2 in Dps was 1.5 ± 0.1 H+/Fe(II) at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2, 12 μmH2O2 addition). Thus we write the Fe(II) oxidation (phase II) reaction as the following. [Fe(II)2−P]FSZ+2+H2O2+H2O→[Fe(III)2O2(OH)−P]FSZ−1+3H+Equation 3 The iron/protein stoichiometry for Fe(II) oxidation by H2O2 was determined by titrating the protein with Fe(II) followed by addition of excess H2O2(Fig. 1 B, curve b). The initial rate of Fe(II) oxidation (ΔA/min) reaches a maximum at 24 Fe(II)/Dps in accordance with the Fe(II) binding stoichiometry of 24 Fe(II)/Dps (Fig.1 A and 1 B, curve a). These results imply that the 12 putative dinuclear ferroxidase sites are involved in the rapid pairwise oxidation of Fe(II) by H2O2. Dps was also examined for catalase activity.

Although it has been suggested that changes in AR phosphorylation might be directly responsible, the basal and regulated phosphorylations of the AR have not been fully determined. We have identified the major sites of AR phosphorylation on ARs expressed in COS-1 cells using a combination of peptide mapping, Edman degradation, and mass spectrometry. We describe the identification of seven AR phosphorylation sites, show that the phosphopeptides seen with exogenously expressed ARs are highly similar to those seen with endogenous ARs in LNCaP cells and show that specific agonists differentially regulate the phosphorylation state of endogenous ARs in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Treatment of LNCaP cells with the synthetic androgen, R1881, elevates phosphorylation of serines 16, 81, 256, 308, 424, and 650. Ser-94 appears constitutively phosphorylated. Forskolin, epidermal growth factor, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increase the phosphorylation of Ser-650. The kinetics of phosphorylation of most sites in response to hormone or forskolin is temporally delayed, reaching a maximum at 2 h post-stimulation. The exception is Ser-81, which continues to display increasing phosphorylation at 6 h. These data provide a basis for analyzing mechanisms of cross-talk between growth factor signaling and androgen in prostate development, physiology, and cancer."

This treatment stimulates hepatic insulin signaling, leading to transcription of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). SREBP-1c has been implicated as a major factor that up-regulates lipogenic genes in response to carbohydrate feeding. However, we presented evidence for another factor, carbohydrate response factor, which is also involved in this response, and we proposed a model wherein SREBP-1c and carbohydrate response factor are independent transcription factors that act in response to insulin and glucose, respectively. In this study, we examined the contribution of SREBP-1c to the expression of lipogenic genes in glucose- and insulin-treated primary rat hepatocytes using an inducible adenovirus system. We found that SREBP-1c overexpression leads to a modest induction of fatty acid synthase, S14, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNAs to 20% (fatty acid synthase), 10% (S14), and 5% (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) of the induction seen by high glucose and insulin treatment. Restoring insulin to cells overexpressing SREBP-1c did not further increase these mRNA levels. In contrast, adenovirus-expressed SREBP-1c did not induce pyruvate kinase mRNA, suggesting that induction of this gene is SREBP-1c-independent. SREBP-1c does indeed play a role in the induction of lipogenic enzyme genes in response to insulin treatment, but it is not sufficient for the induction seen when hepatocytes are treated with insulin and high glucose.

For example, when mammals are fed a high carbohydrate/low fat diet, the expression of genes involved in triglyceride formation (lipogenesis) is induced. This induction occurs primarily at the transcriptional level in the liver and adipose tissue, the major sites of lipogenesis. The induced lipogenic mRNAs include pyruvate kinase, a glycolytic enzyme; fatty acid synthase (FAS)1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), central enzymes in fatty acid synthesis; and malic enzyme, an enzyme involved in the production of NADPH (for review, see Refs. 1Girard J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23235-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). There are two signaling pathways that contribute to lipogenic enzyme induction following a high carbohydrate meal. First, elevated post-prandial blood glucose levels lead to increased insulin secretion by β-cells in the pancreas. This insulin signal is then capable of triggering multiple cascades, leading to increased gene expression in liver or adipose tissue. Second, increased glucose metabolism generates a signal independent of the elevated insulin levels, although the intracellular pathway remains to be elucidated (3Vaulont S. Vasseur-Cognet M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31555-31558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It is difficult to determine the respective roles of these two pathways in the whole animal where both hormonal levels and substrate availability fluctuate following a meal. For this reason, cultured primary hepatocytes have proven useful in mimicking the lipogenic response seen in a fed animal by treatment with controlled levels of the two signals, glucose and insulin (4Decaux J.-F. Antoine B. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11584-11590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither of these signals by itself is sufficient to model the dietary response seen in the animal. For example, in the cases of the S14 gene product and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, insulin treatment alone is capable of a moderate induction of expression in primary hepatocytes, but the addition of high glucose leads to further elevation of expression (5Koo S.-H. Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9437-9445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6O'Callaghan B.L. Koo S.-H., Wu, Y. Freake H.C. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

The basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) has emerged as a major factor involved in the insulin regulation of lipogenic enzyme expression (for review, see Refs. 7Brown M.S.

The mRNA for this transcription factor is induced in primary hepatocytes in response to insulin treatment (10Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Wright M. Yao K.M. Mueller E. Solanes G. Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. J.

Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 14Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Notably, SREBP-1 knockout mice have an impaired ability to respond to carbohydrate feeding (16Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J.-I. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K.

Additionally, in transgenic mice with liver-specific overexpression of SREBP-1c, the rate of lipogenesis is increased as well as the level of lipogenic mRNAs (18Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We have recently provided evidence that the glucose induction is mediated through a transcription factor distinct from SREBP-1c. This factor is designated carbohydrate response factor (ChoRF) as it is able to bind to DNA sequences called carbohydrate response elements (ChoREs), but not to mutant ChoREs that are not glucose-responsive (20Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ChoRF complex that forms on ChoREs is not supershifted with antibodies to SREBP-1c, nor is it competed with oligonucleotides containing a known SREBP-1c binding element (5Koo S.-H. Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9437-9445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These results led us to propose a model in which SREBP-1c and ChoRF both have a role in the dietary induction of lipogenic gene expression. However, the molecular nature of ChoRF is not yet characterized; hence, its role in lipogenic enzyme induction remains unproven. In this study, we have explored the contribution of SREBP-1c to the expression of lipogenic enzyme genes in glucose- and insulin-treated primary rat hepatocytes. For this purpose, we adopted an inducible adenovirus system to control the expression levels of SREBP-1c in hepatocytes. We report that SREBP-1c plays an important role as a downstream regulator of insulin signaling in the induction of lipogenic enzyme genes, but that its expression alone is not sufficient for the induction seen with high glucose and insulin treatment in hepatocytes. These results support our previous model that both glucose metabolism leading to ChoRF activation and insulin signaling resulting in an increase in nuclear SREBP-1c levels play important roles in the carbohydrate stimulation of lipogenic gene expression. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (180–300 g) were fed ad libitum with normal chow and kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle. All animals were handled in accordance with experimental protocols approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Committee on the Care and Use of Animals. Rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.15 ml of Nembutal (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL)/100 g of body weight. Primary hepatocytes were isolated by the collagenase perfusion method and plated in 60-mm Primaria plates at a cell density of 3.6 × 106 cells/plate as described previously (21Kaytor E.N. Shih H.-M.

After a 3-h attachment period, cells were infected with adenovirus for 2 h in Williams' E medium containing 23 mm HEPES, 0.01 μm dexamethasone, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 26 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 5.5 mm glucose. Cells were then cultured in the same medium with or without doxycycline (Sigma) and with an overlay of 0.5 mg/ml Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) for ∼15 h. After this overnight treatment, 5.5 mm (low) or 27.5 mm (high) glucose medium with or without doxycycline and with or without 0.1 unit/ml insulin was added. The inducible adenovirus was prepared according to the method of Becker et al. (22Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B.

The SREBP-1c cDNA product was inserted into the multiple cloning site of pac-TRE-CMV and sequenced for PCR integrity. This construct was then co-transfected with pBH-Tet-VP16 into HEK-293 cells. The resulting recombinant adenovirus was amplified in the same cell line, and a clonal virus was titered by immunofluorescence microscopy using a 1:20 dilution of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody specific for the penton group antigen of adenovirus (Biodesign, Saco, ME). Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Concentrations of RNA were measured spectrophotometrically at A260. Some RT-PCR reactions were performed using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using 250 ng of total RNA. SREBP-1c primers were used at 22 cycles with an annealing temperature of 53 °C. The RT-PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and band intensities were compared by imaging of ethidium bromide staining. For transcript quantification purposes, the LightCyclerTMsystem (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used. This system amplifies and detects PCR products in the same tube. The RT-PCR reactions were set up in microcapillary tubes using 100 ng of RNA, primers listed in Table I, and the LightCycler RNA amplification kit SYBR Green I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The four-step PCR cycle included a denaturing step at 95 °C for 0.1 s, an annealing step at 53 °C for 10 s, an extension step at 72 °C for the time listed in TableI, and a data/fluorescence acquisition step at a temperature just below the product melting temperature (see TableI) for 3 s.

Open table in a new tab To compare transcript expression levels between RNA isolated from hepatocytes treated with different conditions, a dilution series of total RNA from hepatocytes treated with high glucose and insulin was made and assayed in each LightCycler run as a standard curve. The LightCycler software was used to compare amplification in the experimental samples during the log-linear phase to this standard curve. Thus, results from experimental samples were expressed as a percentage of the high glucose with insulin RNA sample. Results from all transcripts were normalized to a control transcript coding for the large ribosomal subunit protein RPL32. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modification of the procedure described previously (24Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Briefly, seven 100-mm plates of cultured hepatocytes were scraped in PBS, combined, and pelleted at 1000 ×g for 3 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 50 μg/ml calpain inhibitor I (Roche), 1 mm PMSF (Sigma), 2 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma)). The mixture was homogenized on ice using a Teflon-on-glass homogenizer attached to a mechanical rotor set at 2800 rpm (Glas-Col, Terre Haute, IN). The homogenization was done in three sets of 20 strokes/set. Nuclei were pelleted by a 10-min centrifugation (500 × g) at 4 °C and washed once in the same buffer. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of hypertonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5% glycerol, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the same protease inhibitors listed in the lysis buffer). After 30 min on ice, the nuclear extract was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein content was determined spectrophotometrically using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein from hepatocyte nuclear extracts (3 or 23 μg) was boiled in 0.2 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% bromphenol blue and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel after a 5% stacking gel. Also loaded on the gel was a protein ladder (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) that is immunoreactive to the secondary antibody, allowing visualization of the ladder on the film. Proteins were electrotransferred onto an Immobilon-P PVDF 0.45-μm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filter was blocked in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5% w/w dry milk, and 0.4% Nonidet P40; SREBP-1c was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (IgG-2A4) raised against amino acids 301–407 of human SREBP-1. IgGs were generated by a hybridoma cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and purified from Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium by a Protein A-Sepharose column. The primary antibody was used at a concentration of 4 μg/ml. Signals were detected using an ECL Western-blot detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as the secondary antibody. To assess the contribution of SREBP-1c to lipogenic gene expression, we used an inducible recombinant adenovirus engineered to express the nuclear form of SREBP-1c. In this system, the recombinant adenoviral construct contains coding sequences for two proteins: the tet-activator protein and the nuclear form of SREBP-1c (23Trinh K. de Vargas L.M. Moss L.G. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48 Suppl. 1: A78Google Scholar). The inducer, doxycycline (a tetracycline analog), activates the constitutively expressed tet-activator protein that then binds to promoter sequences upstream of the adenoviral SREBP-1c gene to increase its expression. Endogenous SREBP-1c is synthesized as a 125-kDa precursor protein that is anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Processing by two proteases occurs in the Golgi and generates the active form that is translocated to the nucleus (25Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether insulin levels influence the processing of the precursor form of SREBP-1c (24Azzout-Marniche D. Becard D. Guichard C. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose to express the amino-terminal portion of the SREBP-1c protein that would be directly targeted to the nucleus (26Nagoshi E. Imamoto N. Sato R. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2221-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Primary rat hepatocytes were transduced with adenovirus for 2 h at a dosage designed to infect >80% of cells (as compared with a β-galactosidase-containing virus of similar titer). When a higher dosage of virus was administered, there was no increase in SREBP-1c expression and toxic effects to the cells were observed. Hepatocytes were treated with fasting levels (5.5 mm) of glucose without insulin but with differing concentrations of the doxycycline inducer for 40 h. RNA was then isolated and subjected to RT-PCR using primers for the nuclear portion of the SREBP-1c mRNA. PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining on an agarose gel (Fig. 1A). A dose-dependent increase in SREBP-1c mRNA accumulation was observed with these doxycycline concentrations. The range of SREBP-1c expression from no doxycycline treatment to treatment with 250 ng/ml doxycycline was ∼8-fold. In the absence of inducer, SREBP-1c expression from the adenovirus was elevated compared with the basal level present in hepatocytes maintained without insulin. Next, we wanted to find the doxycycline concentration that approximates the physiological level of endogenous SREBP-1c mRNA expression in hepatocytes treated with insulin. To do this, RNA from hepatocytes treated with 5.5 mm glucose and insulin for 40 h was subjected to RT-PCR along with the RNAs for the dose-response curve. The products on the gel were quantified by densitometric analysis. Based on this analysis, 25 ng/ml doxycycline was identified as the appropriate inducer concentration to give an exogenous mRNA level comparable with that observed following insulin induction of endogenous SREBP-1c mRNA (data not shown). To examine the time course of adenovirus-directed SREBP-1c expression, virus-treated hepatocytes were cultured in 100 ng/ml doxycycline (a high point on the dose-response curve) and 5.5 mm glucose without insulin and harvested for RNA at different time points. Virus-encoded mRNA begins to accumulate between 8 and 18 h with a maximal accumulation at 40 h after viral infection (Fig.1B). This high level of exogenous SREBP-1c expression was maintained for an additional 25 h. The 40-h time point was used in subsequent experiments. To demonstrate that the adenovirus-encoded nuclear SREBP-1c protein was appropriately translocated and accumulated in the nucleus, an immunoblot was performed (Fig. 2). In nuclear extracts of virus-transduced hepatocytes, a dose-dependent increase in the amount of SREBP-1c protein was observed in response to doxycycline treatment. However, efforts to detect the endogenous nuclear product were unsuccessful. Therefore, the adenoviral mRNA resulted in a significantly greater accumulation of protein compared with endogenous mRNA. Presumably, this is because of the fact that all of the virus-produced protein is directly targeted to the nucleus, whereas the endogenous mRNA is first translated into a precursor protein that must be proteolytically cleaved to generate the nuclear form. Instead of selecting a doxycycline concentration to approximate the amount of endogenous protein in response to insulin, we chose to look at the contribution of SREBP-1c to lipogenic gene induction by comparing expression levels at different doses of inducer. As described above, SREBP-1c has been identified as a major factor controlling lipogenic gene expression in response to nutritional stimuli. However, we have presented evidence for the involvement of an additional transcription factor (5Koo S.-H. Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9437-9445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To determine the relative contribution of SREBP-1c to the dietary induction of lipogenic genes, primary rat hepatocytes were infected with the adenovirus expression vector and then cultured in fasting levels of glucose without insulin, but with varying concentrations of doxycycline. In this experiment, adenovirus expression was established using 0, 25, or 250 ng/ml doxycycline to give a range of SREBP-1c expression. After 40 h of culture, RNA was isolated and subjected to real-time RT-PCR. RNA levels for lipogenic enzyme genes in cells exposed to exogenous SREBP-1c were compared with the levels from noninfected hepatocytes treated with fasting and high glucose (27.5 mm) levels with or without insulin. The first lipogenic mRNA examined was that for fatty acid synthase. FAS mRNA has been previously shown to be induced by insulin (27Paulauskis J.D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 574-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28Prip-Buus C. Perdereau D. Foufelle F. Maury J. Ferre P. Girard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated at least in part by tandem SREBP-1c binding sites centered at −65 in the FAS promoter (29Magana M.M. Koo S.-H. Towle H.C. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4726-4733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Indeed, hepatocytes treated with insulin alone exhibited a marked increase in FAS mRNA level in fasting glucose conditions (Fig.3A). However, when both insulin and high glucose were present in the hepatocyte medium, we observed a synergistic effect on the FAS mRNA level. Hepatocytes were transduced with the SREBP-1c adenoviral construct and maintained in fasting glucose levels without insulin. A modest increase in FAS mRNA accumulation was observed at the lowest levels of viral SREBP-1c expression. A further induction of FAS mRNA was seen in those cells treated with doxycycline to increase SREBP-1c expression. Hence, the increase in exogenous nuclear SREBP-1c levels resulted in additional FAS mRNA accumulation. However, even with the highest dose of doxycycline, equivalent to vast overexpression of SREBP-1c, the accumulation of FAS mRNA only reached ∼20% of that seen with noninfected cells treated with high glucose and insulin. These results indicate that SREBP-1c is indeed involved in the dietary induction of FAS mRNA, but that overexpression of SREBP-1c is insufficient by itself to account for the full induction observed in hepatocytes. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis, converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for SREBP-1c in the regulation of ACC. In the livers of transgenic mice that overexpress SREBP-1c, there is a 2-fold increase in the mRNA levels of ACC (18Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 19Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Additionally, SREBP-1 knockout mice have an impaired ability to induce ACC mRNA when the animals are refed a high carbohydrate meal following a fast (16Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J.-I. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Harada K. Gotoda T. Ishihashi S. Yamada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35832-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). However, ACC mRNA does modestly accumulate following feeding in these animals, suggesting that an additional SREBP-1-independent mechanism may be involved. In cultured hepatocytes, insulin alone had very little, if any, effect on ACC mRNA levels in noninfected cells maintained in fasting levels of glucose (Fig. 3B). Glucose and insulin treatment in combination had a strong synergistic effect on ACC mRNA induction, even more striking than the effect on FAS mRNA. When cells transduced with the adenovirus vector were compared with untreated cells maintained in fasting glucose levels without insulin, there was a stepwise increase in ACC mRNA accumulation with increasing exogenous SREBP-1c expression. In this case, with the highest dose of doxycycline, the ACC mRNA level reached ∼5% of that seen with high glucose- and insulin-treated hepatocytes. As with FAS, these results suggest that SREBP-1c alone is insufficient for the full induction of ACC mRNA. S14 is a 17-kDa nuclear protein thought to be involved in the regulation of lipogenesis (30Cunningham B.A. Moncur J.T. Huntington J.T. Kinlaw W.B. Thyroid. 1998; 8: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). S14 mRNA is induced in mammalian liver following a high carbohydrate diet. Recent evidence has identified an SREBP-1c binding site at −131 in the S14promoter (31Mater M.K. Thelen A.P. Pan D.A. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32725-32732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The ability of an S14 (−290 to +18) reporter construct to respond to insulin is abolished when this site is mutated (5Koo S.-H. Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9437-9445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). S14 mRNA accumulates in cultured hepatocytes after treatment with insulin alone (Fig. 3C), but is induced further with the addition of high glucose. Similar to ACC, in low glucose conditions without insulin, S14mRNA accumulated stepwise with the increase in exogenous SREBP-1c expression. However, at the highest level of SREBP-1c expression, S14 mRNA levels reached only ∼10% of the level observed with high glucose and insulin treatment. Under fasting glucose levels without insulin, SREBP-1c expression alone is not capable of fully inducing S14, ACC, or FAS mRNA"

LANA is also a DNA-binding protein and has been shown to specifically bind to a region within the terminal repeat. Here, we have performed a detailed analysis of the DNA-binding activity of LANA and show that it binds two sites separated by 22 bp. We used electrophoretic mobility shift assay to quantitatively analyze the binding sites and determined that the Kd of the high affinity site is 1.51 ± 0.16 nm. Examination of the contribution of nucleotides near the ends of the site showed that the core binding site consists of 16 bp, 13 of which are conserved between both sites. Analysis of the affinity of each site alone and in tandem revealed that the binding to the second site is primarily due to cooperativity with the first site. Using deletion and point mutations, we show that both sites contribute to the ability of LANA to suppress transcription and to facilitate DNA replication. In addition, we show that the ability of LANA to carry out these functions is directly proportional to its affinity for the sites in this region.

The recent finding that LANA binds to a region within the KSHV TR and is capable of maintaining a plasmid containing a single copy of the KSHV TR indicates that it also belongs to this functional class of viral origin-binding proteins (9Garber A.C. Shu M.A., Hu, J. Renne R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7882-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 17Ballestas M.E. Kaye K.M. J.

Viral origin-binding proteins directly bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner, but the roles these proteins have in the initiation of replication is still unclear and may vary between the different proteins. For example, large T antigen and E1 both have helicase activity and may themselves serve to unwind DNA during replication, whereas EBNA-1 seems to be dependent on cellular factors for this function (20Dean F.B.

However, it is clear that all these viral proteins must facilitate the formation of an initiation-of-replication complex, composed primarily of cellular factors, at or near their binding sites.

EBV oriP, which requires the trans-acting viral protein EBNA-1, has been studied extensively. It is composed of two elements, the dyad symmetry (DS) and the family of repeats (FR), separated by ∼1 kb of unique sequence. The DS element is composed of two pairs of EBNA-1-binding sites, with the sites in each pair separated by 22 bp, center to center. It is the DS element that, in the presence of EBNA-1, is the functional replicator of oriP(29Harrison S. Fisenne K. Hearing J. J.

The FR element is composed of 20 copies of a 30-bp repeat and is responsible for long-term maintenance of oriP-containing DNA (33Krysan P.J. Haase S.B. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell.

Recently, it was shown that sequences that lie between the EBNA-1-binding sites are also important, and it has been hypothesized that they may be targets of factors involved in the origin recognition complex (35Koons M.D. Van Scoy S. Hearing J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10582-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).In addition to facilitating DNA replication, viral origin-binding proteins such as EBNA-1 and E2 also have important transcriptional regulatory effects (36Reisman D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4777-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). KSHV is similar in that the TR DNA, which contains the LANA-binding site and presumably the origin, contains a transcriptional enhancer element (9Garber A.C. Shu M.A., Hu, J. Renne R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7882-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that LANA has been shown to trans-activate many promoters through interaction with upstream factors, when tethered to DNA by a Gal4-binding domain, LANA has repeatedly been shown to suppress transcription (15Krithivas A. Young D.B. Liao G. Greene D. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9637-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 19Schwam D.R. Luciano R.L. Mahajan S.S. Wong L. Wilson A.C. J.

Virol. 2001; 75: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously shown that LANA suppresses transcription from a reporter construct containing TR sequences (9Garber A.C. Shu M.A., Hu, J. Renne R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7882-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).To further our understanding of how LANA functions as a viral origin-binding protein, we analyzed the LANA-binding region of the TR and the contributions of the binding sites in this region to the ability of LANA to suppress transcription and to promote DNA replication. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and DNase I footprinting, we show that LANA binds to two sites, LANA-binding site 1 (LBS-1) and LANA-binding site 2 (LBS-2), which are separated by 22 bp, center to center. Analysis of LBS-1 indicated that LANA binds with an affinity similar to that of EBNA-1 to the DS element (47Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7819-7826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A detailed quantitative analysis of nucleotides at the termini of the LANA-binding site identified a core binding site consisting of 16 bp, 13 of which are conserved between LBS-1 and LBS-2. Analysis of LBS-1 and LBS-2 alone and in tandem indicated that, like the EBNA-1-binding sites in the DS element, the second site is bound cooperatively. Analyses using a series of deletion and transversion mutations showed that LBS-1 and LBS-2 both contribute to the ability of LANA to suppress transcription and to facilitate replication. Changes to the binding sites resulted in proportional effects in both phenotypes, indicating that LANA may carry out these two functions through related mechanisms.DISCUSSIONDuring latent infection, KSHV maintains its genome as an extrachromosomal episome. Similar to other DNA viruses, SV40, human papilloma virus, and EBV, the replication of the KSHV genome requires atrans-acting viral protein (in this case, LANA) to bind at the origin of replication (ori). These viral orielements, as well as cellular ori elements in general, are associated with numerous transcription factors (44Demeret C., Le Moal M. Yaniv M. Thierry F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4777-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,58Toth E.C. Marusic L. Ochem A. Patthy A. Pongor S. Giacca M. Falaschi A.

The SV40 and human papilloma virus ori elements each contain numerous cellular transcription factor-binding sites, whereas EBV oriP is composed of two elements: the DS element, which contains the replicator element, and the FR element, which is a potent enhancer in the presence of EBNA-1 (29Harrison S. Fisenne K. Hearing J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wysokenski D.A. Yates J.L. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here, we show that LANA binds to two sites similar to one-half of the EBV DS element. LBS-1 is a high affinity site capable of facilitating the cooperative binding of LANA to LBS-2, much like sites 1 and 4 of the DS element facilitate binding to sites 2 and 3, respectively (29Harrison S. Fisenne K. Hearing J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,64Summers H. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Either of the DS pair of sites has been shown to be sufficient for at least partial replication (29Harrison S. Fisenne K. Hearing J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Koons M.D. Van Scoy S. Hearing J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10582-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 65Yates J.L. Camiolo S.M. Bashaw J.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4512-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although the molecular details have not been established to the same degree, two other γ-herpesviruses, herpesvirus saimiri and herpesvirus papio, also contain similar DS-like elements in their respective orielements (66Loeb D.D. Sung N.S. Pesano R.L. Sexton C.J. Hutchison III, C. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 67Yates J.L. Camiolo S.M. Ali S. Ying A. Virology. 1996; 222: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 68Kung S.H. Medveczky P.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These conserved similarities suggest that the disparate affinity and cooperative binding of the two sites are important to extrachromosomal DNA replication. However, manipulation of this arrangement by converting LBS-2 into a high affinity site did not cause a significant reduction in replication. It is possible that this conserved arrangement of sites is not critical to replication of relatively small plasmids, but is important in the context of replicating the entire 140-kb genome. It is also possible that the distinctive arrangement of this element plays a role in the regulation of origin firing, which may not be critical in rapidly dividing cell lines.As we better resolve the KSHV latent ori element, one notable difference from EBV is the lack of an FR element. The FR element of EBV is essential for long-term maintenance of episomal DNA, presumably by tethering the plasmid to the chromosomes for proper segregation to daughter cells (34Marechal V. Dehee A. Chikhi-Brachet R. Piolot T. Coppey-Moisan M. Nicolas J.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4385-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 69Wu H. Ceccarelli D.F. Frappier L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 70Hung S.C. Kang M.S. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 71Kanda T. Otter M. Wahl G.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 49-58PubMed Google Scholar). Three copies of the DS element can be used to replace the FR element and to reconstitute its maintenance function (32Wysokenski D.A. Yates J.L. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2657-2666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strong transcriptional enhancer activity of the FR element indicates that, when bound by EBNA-1, it also has an effect on DNA structure, perhaps serving a function analogous to the cellular transcription factors associated with other orielements. Although the KSHV putative latent ori element has no FR-type structure, the TR, which contains LBS-1 and LBS-2, is repeated 30–40 times in the KSHV genome; this repetition may be sufficient to serve the maintenance function in a manner similar to the multimerized DS element. When multimerized, as is the case in the genome, the KSHV TR is a potent enhancer (9Garber A.C. Shu M.A., Hu, J. Renne R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7882-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); transcription factors employed in this enhancer could serve chromatin-remodeling functions similar to those of the FR element in EBV.We have shown that the ability of the LANA C-terminal domain to suppress TR enhancer-dependent transcription is directly proportional to its ability to bind at LBS-1 and LBS-2. No other viral origin-binding protein has been reported to negatively regulate transcription in this way. Large T antigen and E2 of human papilloma virus both suppress transcription by binding DNA and inhibiting transcription complex formation at promoters, but not from enhancers (72Thierry F. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3391-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 73Myers R.M. Rio D.C. Robbins A.K. Tjian R. Cell. 1981; 25: 373-384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In most cases, E2 and EBNA-1 act as strong transcriptional activators when bound to DNA (36Reisman D. Yates J. Sugden B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1822-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 37Reisman D. Sugden B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3838-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 38Spalholz B.A. Yang Y.C.

Some qualities of transcription factor activation must be required for efficient replication function, as transcription factor associations are found in most well studied origins of replication (44Demeret C., Le Moal M. Yaniv M. Thierry F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4777-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 58Toth E.C. Marusic L. Ochem A. Patthy A. Pongor S. Giacca M. Falaschi A.

Virol. 1995; 69: 1878-1886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 63Deyerle K.L. Sajjadi F.G. Subramani S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 356-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In many cases, the efficiency of replication has been linked to the presence of these transcriptional activators (43Turner W.J. Woodworth M.E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5638-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 74Baumann M. Feederle R. Kremmer E. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 75Li R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30310-30314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). With this in mind, it seems strange that LANA would be acting as a transcriptional suppressor. However, it is the presence of transcriptional activators that activate replication, not transcription itself. In fact, transcriptional activity has been shown to be inversely proportional to replication in autonomously replicating chromosomes (76Haase S.B. Heinzel S.S. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2516-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This finding supports the idea that some contribution of transcription factors, probably chromatin remodeling, is necessary for the formation of pre-replication complexes and the subsequent initiation of DNA replication, whereas transcription itself is inhibitory.Manipulations of the binding sites of LANA cause similar changes in both its ability to suppress transcription and to facilitate DNA replication (Figs. 5 and 6). This indicates that the mechanisms of these processes may be related or interdependent such that replication may inhibit local transcription, or transcription may need to be inhibited to facilitate efficient replication. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the LANA C-terminal domain alone is sufficient for transcriptional suppression and DNA replication (9Garber A.C. Shu M.A., Hu, J. Renne R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7882-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).2 Our finding that the TR element contains enhancer activity is in congruence with the presence of transcriptional activity within the vicinity of all cellular and viral origins of replication. The mechanism by which LANA suppresses this transcriptional activation and at the same time facilitates DNA replication needs to be further elucidated. It has recently been shown that origin recognition complex/EBNA-1 interaction is critical for oriP function (77Schepers A. Ritzi M. Bousset K. Kremmer E. Yates J.L. Harwood J. Diffley J.F. Hammerschmidt W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4588-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 78Dhar S.K. Yoshida K. Machida Y. Khaira P. Chaudhuri B. Wohlschlegel J.A. Leffak M. Yates J. Dutta A.

Pflumm M. Chesnokov I. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Marr J. Romanowski P. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 311-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 81Loupart M.L. Krause S.A.

Development. 2001; 128: 1697-1707PubMed Google Scholar), and LANA has been shown to co-localize with heterochromatic regions (83Szekely L. Kiss C. Mattsson K. Kashuba E. Pokrovskaja K. Juhasz A. Holmvall P. Klein G. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2889-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with a model in which the binding affinity of LANA for LBS-1 and LBS-2 within the TR determines its ability to mediate the interaction between the viral episomal genome, the origin recognition complex, and a manifest heterochromatic environment, conducive to DNA replication and inhibitory to transcription. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV),1 also called human herpesvirus 8, is a γ2-herpesvirus strongly associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and a plasmablastic variety of multicentric Castleman's disease (1Chang Y.

During latent infection, the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), as well as a small subset of additional viral genes, is expressed, and the genome is replicated and segregated to infected daughter cells (4Boshoff C.

The observation of persistent methylation in human cancer cells lacking the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 suggests the involvement of other DNA methyltransferases in gene silencing in cancer. To test this hypothesis, we have evaluated methylation and gene expression in cancer cells specifically depleted of DNMT3A or DNMT3B,de novo methyltransferases that are expressed in adult tissues. Here we have shown that depletion of DNMT3B, but not DNMT3A, induced apoptosis of human cancer cells but not normal cells. DNMT3B depletion reactivated methylation-silenced gene expression but did not induce global or juxtacentromeric satellite demethylation as did specific depletion of DNMT1. Furthermore, the effect of DNMT3B depletion was rescued by exogenous expression of either of the splice variants DNMT3B2 or DNMT3B3 but not DNMT1. These results indicate that DNMT3B has significant site selectivity that is distinct from DNMT1, regulates aberrant gene silencing, and is essential for cancer cell survival.

Northern blots were scanned and quantified using an alpha imager (Alpha Innovotech). Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and processed for TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) analysis using a fluorescein apoptosis detection system (Promega) or cell-death detection ELISA Plus kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) performed according to the manufacturers' protocols. Cytoplasmic histone DNA assay was performed using the cell-death detection ELISA Plus kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Standard protocols were used. Briefly, 5 μg of DNA were digested with either HpaII orMspI (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's conditions. Samples were loaded on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a Zeta-Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). Blots were hybridized to a classic satellite 2 oligonucleotide as previously described (14Szyf M.

Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). As a sample loading control, 100 ng of the same reverse-transcribed cDNA was used to amplify α-actin using the forward primer 5′-ACGAAACTACCTTCAACTCCATC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TGGTCTCAAGTCAGTGTACAGGT-3′. Specificity of RASSF1Aamplification was verified by Southern blot using as a probe the32P-labeled internal oligonucleotide probe 5′-GCAACCTCTTCATGAGCTTG-3′. Genomic DNA from lipofectin control and antisense-treated cells were bisulfite treated (Intergen Company) and used to amplify the RASSF1A promoter region as described in Ref. 16Dammann R., Li, C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar. PCR products were cloned into TA cloning vectors (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Atlas human cancer cDNA expression arrays (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. DNA samples were digested with HpaII and AciI or withMspI (normalization control) and incubated with 1×Taq buffer, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.25 unit of AmpliTaq (PerkinElmer), and [3H]dCTP at 56 °C for 1 h as described in Ref. 17Pogribny I., Yi, P. James S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999; 262: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar. Samples were precipitated in trichloroacetic acid, applied to nitrocellulose filters, and processed for scintillation counting. To test the roles of the DNMT isoforms in cancer cells, we identified potent isotype-specific antisense inhibitors. We screened numerous antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (AS p-ODN, 20 bases in length) complementary to 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions as well as coding sequences of the respective mRNA for the ability to specifically reduce the mRNA of the target isotype after 24 h of treatment. The location of the most potent of these inhibitors within their target mRNA is shown in Fig.1 A. Potency and dose dependence of the inhibition was assessed by treating human cancer cells growing in culture with increasing concentrations (0–75 nm) of inhibitors DNMT1-AS1,DNMT3A-AS1, DNMT3B-AS1 (antisense oligonucleotides), or mismatch (MM) (Fig. 1 B). All inhibitors had IC50 values for mRNA inhibition of less than 50 nm. To determine the specificity of the inhibition, Northern blots with total RNA isolated from treated cells were hybridized with probes for the given target DNMT isoform as well as with probes for non-target DNMT mRNA and the non-target mRNA glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Non-target mRNA were not affected by any of the inhibitors tested, and, as expected, mismatch control oligonucleotides had no effect on any of the mRNA examined (Fig. 1 B, left panel). Several human tumor cell lines of various tissue origins were similarly tested with essentially identical results (data not shown). The DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1,DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) are S-phase-specific genes. Therefore, to control for possible indirect effects onDNMT3B mRNA levels, Northern blots with mRNA from DNMT3B-depleted A549 cells were also hybridized with probes for another S-phase-specific gene, histone H4. DNMT3B depletion had no effect on histone H4 expression or on DNMT1 mRNA levels (Fig.1 B, middle panel). The ability to depleteDNMT3B from two normal cells, human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) and normal foreskin fibroblasts (MRHF), was also shown (Fig.1 B, right panel). To demonstrate reduction in target protein levels, we raised antibodies specific for DNMT1 (8Fournel M. Sapieha P. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. All antibodies were shown to specifically recognize target human proteins (expressed in baculovirus or mammalian systems) with high affinity; however, endogenous levels of DNMT3A protein were below the level of detection in all cell lines tested (data not shown). As expected from the mRNA inhibition, Western blot analysis with anti-DNMT1 and anti-DNMT3B antibodies on nuclear extracts prepared from cancer cells treated with increasing doses of DNMT1, DNMT3A, or DNMT3B inhibitors for 48 h showed selective dose-dependent inhibition of only the target DNMT isoform (Fig. 1 C). DNMT1 has been shown to be in a complex with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an auxiliary factor for DNA replication. This interaction can be disrupted by the cell cycle regulator p21WAF1/CIP1 (18Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W., Ng, H.H., Xu, G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), suggesting that DNMT1 may play an active role in replication in addition to its role in regulation of gene expression. In fact, Dnmt1 mutant fibroblasts proliferate at only one-third the rate of control cells (19Jackson-Grusby L. Beard C. Possemato R. Tudor M. Fambrough D. Csankovszki G. Dausman J. Lee P. Wilson C. Lander E. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 2001; 1: 31-39Crossref Scopus (559) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of DNMT3A or DNMT3B depletion on the proliferation of human cancer cells, we treated lung cancer cells (A549) or breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with increasing doses (0–75 nm) of the inhibitors DNMT3A-AS1 or DNMT3B-AS1 over several days. A potent dose-dependent antiproliferative effect upon DNMT3B depletion was observed in both cancer cell lines (Fig.2 A). In contrast, DNMT3A depletion had no significant effect on the proliferation of either cell type (Fig. 2 A). The antiproliferative effect observed was independent of cellular p53 status because MDA-MB-231 cells harboring mutant p53 (20Li Y. Upadhyay S. Bhuiyan M. Sarkar F.H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3166-3172Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and the p53 wild type A549 cell line (21Zuo Z. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12250-12258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were both sensitive to DNMT3B depletion. In addition, the antiproliferative effect of DNMT3B depletion was also seen in T24 human bladder cancer cells that lack p53 protein (22Kawasaki T. Tomita Y. Bilim V. Takeda M. Takahashi K. Kumanishi T. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (data not shown) as well as the p53 wild type HCT116 human colon cancer cell line (23Chang B.D. Xuan Y. Broude E.V. Zhu H. Schott B. Fang J. Roninson I.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4808-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B,right panel). Additional diversity within the DNMT3A and DNMT3Bgene family exists because several splice variants for both have been identified in mouse and human tissues (10Xie S. Wang Z. Okano M. Nogami M., Li, Y., He, W.W. Okumura K. Li E. Gene. 1999; 236: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 11Robertson K.D. Uzvolgyi E. Liang G. Talmadge C. Sumegi J. Gonzales F.A. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 24Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). These splice variants have the potential to encode proteins with altered activities.DNMT3B3, for example, lacks exons 10, 21, and 22 and yields a protein with altered spacing between conserved methyltransferase motifs VI and IX in the catalytic domain (11Robertson K.D. Uzvolgyi E. Liang G. Talmadge C. Sumegi J. Gonzales F.A. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). DNMT3B2 lacks only exon 10, which lies outside the conserved catalytic domain.DNMT3B4 and DNMT3B5 give rise to truncated proteins without the conserved motifs IX and X (11Robertson K.D. Uzvolgyi E. Liang G. Talmadge C. Sumegi J. Gonzales F.A. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), which could conceivably encode a dominant negative function. The conservation of these splice variants from mouse to human suggests that they encode important cellular functions. The antisense inhibitors described here target 3′-UTR sequences of DNMT3A and DNMT3Bcommon to all the splice variants. Thus, the inhibitors tested lead to a depletion of all DNMT3A and DNMT3B mRNA and proteins (Fig. 1,B and C). To test whether the effects of DNMT3B depletion could be ascribed to ablation of a single DNMT3B splice variant, we evaluated the ability of individual, exogenously expressed DNMT3B splice variants to reverse or rescue the phenotype produced by depletion of all DNMT3B forms. It is important to note that the exogenously expressed DNMT isoforms do not contain the target sequence of the antisense inhibitors, which target sequences in the 3′-untranslated regions and thus do not compete for inhibitor and are not themselves inhibited. Several cell lines were tested for the ability to express sufficient levels of exogenous DNMT3B2, DNMT3B3, and DNMT1 after transient transfections. HCT116 cells were used because they were the only cell type found to express exogenous DNMT3B protein 48 h after transient transfection in a significant proportion of the population. Expression of the HA-tagged DNMT3B2, DNMT3B3, and DNMT1 proteins was confirmed 48 h after transfection of HCT116 cells by Western blot with both anti-HA and anti-DNMT3B antibodies (Fig.2 B, left panel). HCT116 cells were treated for 72 h with a combination of either DNMT3B-AS1 (75 nm) and the empty vector pCGN, orDNMT3B-AS1 (75 nm) and pCGN-DNMT3B2, pCGN-DNMT3B3, or pCGN-DNMT1 plasmids. After the initial treatment period, cells were left untreated for an additional 24 h at which point cell colonies were visualized by methylene blue staining. The effect of DNMT3B depletion was rescued by exogenous expression of either DNMT3B2 or DNMT3B3 but not by DNMT1 or vector sequences alone (Fig. 2 B, right panel). These results demonstrate the selectivity of the inhibition for the DNMT3B enzymes and suggest that DNMT3B2 and DNMT3B3 perform similar roles in cancer cells clearly distinct from those of DNMT1. In an attempt to identify the gene expression changes induced by DNMT3B depletion (48 h treatment), we performed cDNA microarray assays (Atlas human cancer arrays). DNMT3B depletion significantly altered the expression of a limited set of genes on the array (∼10 of 588 genes). The genes that showed the greatest fold changes are shown in Fig.2 C, left panel. The observed changes in gene expression are consistent with the inhibition of proliferation. Induction of caspases 9 and 10 is suggestive of induction of an apoptotic pathway. Western blot analysis confirmed the induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and suppression of PCNA at the protein level (data not shown). However, because these genes are not known to be regulated by methylation, these changes may either be secondary to the reactivation of methylation-silenced genes or may be regulated by the cellular levels of DNMT3B protein. In addition to the broad analysis of gene expression by cDNA arrays, we also began a systematic analysis of specific genes previously shown to be silenced by methylation at high frequencies in lung cancers. Promoter methylation and silencing of death-associated protein kinase is associated with non-small cell lung cancer (25Kim D.H. Nelson H.H. Wiencke J.K. Christiani D.C. Wain J.C. Mark E.J. Kelsey K.T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1765-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, methylation-specific PCR analysis revealed that DAP kinase is not methylated (within the region of the MSP-PCR primers) in either A549 or MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). The RAS effector homologue RASSF1A is a candidate tumor suppressor gene that has very recently been shown to be inactivated by methylation in a high percentage of lung, breast, and renal tumors (16Dammann R., Li, C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 26Burbee D.G. Forgacs E. Zochbauer-Muller S. Shivakumar L. Fong K. Gao B. Randle D. Kondo M. Virmani A. Bader S. Sekido Y. Latif F. Milchgrub S. Toyooka S. Gazdar A.F. Lerman M.I. Zabarovsky E. White M. Minna J.D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 27Dammann R. Yang G. Pfeifer G.P. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3105-3109PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, RASSF1A has been shown to be silenced by methylation in both A549 and MDA-MB-231 cells (16Dammann R., Li, C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). We examined whether DNMT3B depletion could lead to reactivation of RASSF1A. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated thatRASSF1A expression was induced in a dose-dependent manner by DNMT3B depletion in both MDA-MB-231 (data not shown) and A549 cells (Fig. 2 C,middle panel), demonstrating the requirement of DNMT3B for active suppression of this gene in these cancer cells. Interestingly, higher doses of DNMT3B-AS1 were required to reactivate RASSF1A in A549 cells when compared with MDA-MB-231 cells. This is consistent with the observation that higher doses of 5-aza-dC are also required for its reactivation in A549 cells relative to MDA-MB-231 cells (16Dammann R., Li, C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). DNMT3A and DNMT3B have recently been shown to be transcriptional repressors that function in part by recruiting the chromatin remodeling histone deacetylase enzymes (HDAC) (28Bachman K.E. Rountree M.R. Baylin S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32282-32287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 29Kuks F. Burgers W.A. Godin N. Kasai M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Therefore, DNMT3B-mediated gene suppression may involve both methylation-dependent and methylation-independent HDAC-dependent mechanisms. To investigate the potential involvement of DNMT3B-associated HDAC activity in the reactivation of RASSF1A induced by DNMT3 depletion, we treated cells with increasing doses of the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) alone or with a combination of TSA andDNMT3B-AS1. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with TSA alone did not reactivate silenced RASSF1A but, as expected, DNMT3B depletion alone did (Fig. 2 C, right panel). The combination of TSA and DNMT3B depletion resulted in higher levels of RASSF1A expression (Fig. 2 C, right panel), suggesting that although the dominant mechanism of RASSF1A silencing in these cells is methylation-dependent, inhibition of HDAC activity cooperates with DNMT3B inhibition. Bisulfite genomic sequencing confirmed that the RASSF1A promoter was highly methylated in A549 cells and revealed demethylation of CpG sites within the RASSF1A promoter in DNMT3B-depleted A549 cells (Fig.4 A). The demethylation observed was limited to fewer CpGs compared than that generally seen by either 5-aza-dC-induced demethylation of CpG islands or by specific inhibition of the maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 by antisense inhibitors, where demethylation of most CpG sites within hypermethylated CpG islands is seen (8Fournel M. Sapieha P. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This suggests that DNMT3B differs from DNMT1 in terms of its site selectivity and regulates selected CpG sites within theRASSF1A promoter, whereas DNMT1 is required to maintain methylation of all CpG sites. However, because DNMT3B depletion resulted in significant antiproliferative activity, it remains possible that the most affected (demethylated) cells are in fact underrepresented due to selection. Because expression of RASSF1A transcripts is associated with both loss of anchorage-independent growth and apoptosis of cancer cells (16Dammann R., Li, C. Yoon J.H. Chin P.L. Bates S. Pfeifer G.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 30Vos M.D. Ellis C.A. Bell A. Birrer M.J. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35669-35672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that cell death by apoptosis was a contributing factor to the observed antiproliferative effect. Flow cytometry studies on DNMT3B-depleted A549 cells demonstrated altered cell cycle distributions with an accumulation of cells in G1, a decreased S-phase population, and, most strikingly, a large increase in a sub-G1 population, suggestive of apoptotic cells. Vehicle controls or DNMT3A-depleted cells showed no such alterations (Fig. 3 A,left panel). A549 cells treated for 24 h with DNMT3B inhibitors showed minimal effects, suggesting that prolonged DNMT3B depletion is required to elicit the apoptotic response. TUNEL assays (Fig 3 A, right panel) and cytoplasmic histone-DNA assays (data not shown) confirmed that DNMT3B depletion induced apoptotic cell death of cancer cells. The induction of apoptosis was dependent on both the dose and the potency of the three separate DNMT3B inhibitors tested (data not shown). To determine whether normal cells exhibited sensitivity to DNMT3B depletion similar to that of the cancer cells, we treated HMEC and MRHF cells with DNMT3B inhibitors. DNMT3B depletion did not result in cell cycle alterations or induce apoptosis in these normal cells (Fig. 3 B, left panel). Apoptosis was again seen by the cytoplasmic histone apoptosis assay in DNMT3B-depleted A549 cells (pos. control) but not in similarly treated normal cells (Fig. 3 B, right panel). The cancer-specific apoptosis observed is consistent with a mechanism involving re-expression of genes aberrantly silenced in cancer cells. However, whether activation of the apoptotic program is the result of reactivation of a limited set of genes or is the net effect of reactivation of many silenced genes acting in concert will be of interest for future studies, as will be investigation of the tissue specificity of DNMT3B-suppressed genes. Global demethylation of mouse fibroblasts can induce p53-dependent apoptosis (19Jackson-Grusby L. Beard C. Possemato R. Tudor M. Fambrough D. Csankovszki G. Dausman J. Lee P. Wilson C. Lander E. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 2001; 1: 31-39Crossref Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Although the apoptosis described here is p53-independent, we determined the effect of DNMT3B depletion on global methylation levels and juxtacentromeric satellite methylation. Global methylation was evaluated by [3H]dCTP single nucleotide extension assays on DNA from A549 cells treated with DNMT3B inhibitors for up to 4 days. DNMT3B depletion did not produce significant global demethylation at any of these time points (Fig.4 B, left panel). Juxtacentromeric classic satellite DNA is normally heavily methylated, but DNA from Dnmt3b−/− mice or humans with inactivating mutations in DNMT3B (chromosome instability and immunodeficiency syndrome (ICF) patients) show almost no methylation in this region (31Xu G.L. Bestor T.H. Bourc'his D. Hsieh C.L. Tommerup N. Bugge M. Hulten M., Qu, X. Russo J.J. Viegas-Pequignot E. Nature. 1999; 402: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 32Hansen R.S. Wijmenga C. Luo P. Stanek A.M. Canfield T.K. Weemaes C.M. Gartler S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96 (29): 14412-14417Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). DNMT1-depleted cells showed strong demethylation of the classic satellite 2 region (Fig. 4 B, right panel) similar to that produced by the global demethylator 5-aza-dC. In contrast, demethylation was not seen in DNMT3B-depleted cells (Fig. 4 B, right panel). These results demonstrate that the apoptosis observed is not a consequence of genome-wide hypomethylation and that DNMT3B is required to establish, but not to maintain, methylation of classic satellites in cancer cells. Because limited inhibition of DNMT3B in cancer cells produced primarily antiproliferative effects, whereas DNMT3B depletion with higher doses of DNMT3B-AS1 resulted in apoptosis, it is interesting to speculate that genes regulating the proliferation of cancer cells are more sensitive to DNMT3B depletion and those controlling survival pathways require greater levels of DNMT3B depletion. At the time of submission of this paper, Rhee et al. (33Rhee I. Bachman K.E. Park B.H. Jair K.W. Yen R.W. Schuebel K.E. Cui H. Feinberg A.P Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Baylin S.B. Vogelstein B. Nature. 2002; 416: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar) reported the findings on two DNMT3B−/− HCT116 colon cancer clones that they selected following two rounds of homologous recombination. They also demonstrated that DNMT3B, in cooperation with DNMT1, is required for optimal neoplastic growth. Consistent with our findings, the lack of DNMT3B did not induce demethylation of juxtacentromeric satellite sequences. In contrast, however, the twoDNMT3B−/− clones did not show altered growth properties or apoptosis. This discrepancy most likely results from the differences in methodologies employed to deplete cellular DNMT3B levels. Gene disruption by homologous recombination requires two rounds of selection to yield DNMT3B−/− clones. This process would clearly select against cells that underwent apoptosis or had any other growth disadvantage, for example due to reactivation of tumor suppressor genes by demethylation. The method described in this study specifically depletes DNMT3B in an entire treated population of cells and therefore is not biased by selection. Moreover, because the gene-targeting strategy targets only 2 of the more than 20 exons of theDNMT3B gene, while the antisense inhibitors were entirely depleted of DNMT3B transcripts, it remains possible that other domains or alternatively spliced DNMT3B mRNA retain DNMT3B functions. In summary, our results provide evidence that DNA methyltransferase isoforms display significant methylation site specificity and demonstrate that the de novo methyltransferase DNMT3B is required for the active suppression of genes and for the survival of cancer cells. These results also suggest that DNMT3B inhibitors may have potential as novel cancer therapeutics. We thank Jeffrey Besterman for critical review of the manuscript and helpful suggestions, Steve Hayes for helpful comments, and Isabelle Dupont for excellent technical work."
https://openalex.org/W2126259892,"The Drosophila protein Sex-lethal (SXL) promotes skipping of exon 3 from its own pre-mRNA. An unusual sequence arrangement of two AG dinucleotides and an intervening polypyrimidine (Py)-tract at the 3' end of intron 2 is important for Sxl autoregulation. Here we show that U2AF interacts with the Py-tract and downstream AG, whereas the spliceosomal protein SPF45 interacts with the upstream AG and activates it for the second catalytic step of the splicing reaction. SPF45 represents a new class of second step factors, and its interaction with SXL blocks splicing at the second step. These results are in contrast with other known mechanisms of splicing regulation, which target early events of spliceosome assembly. A similar role for SPF45 is demonstrated in the activation of a cryptic 3' ss generated by a mutation that causes human beta-thalassemia."

In a mouse, part of cellular TFIIH is localized within the nucleolus and is associated with subpopulations of both RNA polymerase I and the basal factor TIF-IB.

Moreover, like RFC subunits, Rad17 has a conserved nucleotide-binding domain, and purified human Rad17 complex has ATPase activity that can be stimulated by ssDNA or primed DNA (27Griffiths D.J.

Most recently, it has been shown by electron microscopy that Rad17-RFC and Hus1-Rad1-Rad9 assemble to form RFC- and PCNA-like structures, respectively (23Griffith J.D. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. J.

Taken together, these studies have led to the proposal that Rad17, along with RFC subunits, binds to DNA directly and then functions to load the Hus1-Rad1-Rad9 complex onto DNA. The complex, in turn, may facilitate the recruitment and/or activation of other factors.Using a biochemically tractable system, Xenopus egg extract, we have previously shown that the activation of the replication checkpoint requires RNA primer synthesis by the primase of pol α (32Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, this laboratory and others (7Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 9Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) have found thatXenopus ATR (XATR) is required for the replication checkpoint. XATR binds to chromatin specifically in S phase with or without replication inhibitors, suggesting that XATR may monitor ongoing or stalled replication and transmit the checkpoint signal to downstream factors (9Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).Whether metazoan homologs of other rad proteins are involved in the DNA replication checkpoint has yet to be demonstrated. Moreover, little is known about how these Rad sensor proteins recognize and assemble onto DNA replication substrates. This has been complicated by the fact that checkpoint genes, such as ATR, Hus1, andChk1, are essential for cell viability in mammals (10Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.-S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K.

Using a nucleus-free DNA replication system we have found that immunodepletion of Xhus1 abrogates the replication checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation of Xchk1ΔKD. Chromatin binding assays demonstrate that association of XATR and Xhus1 with chromatin is dependent on initiation of replication. Furthermore, binding of Xhus1 to chromatin is independent of XATR, and binding of XATR is independent of Xhus1. Detailed dissection of the loading requirements shows that initiation of replication in the absence of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA precludes loading of XATR and Xhus1. However, in the absence of pol α, XATR associates with chromatin, whereas Xhus1 fails to bind to chromatin. Overall, our results suggest that XATR binds to RPA-coated single-stranded DNA to form an inactive complex. Following this, the pol α-dependent stable association of Xhus1 with this complex activates the checkpoint pathway.DISCUSSIONWe have cloned the Xenopus homolog of Hus1 (Xhus1) and studied its potential role as a sensor for the DNA replication checkpoint response. Immunodepletion of Xhus1 abolished the checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation of Xchk1ΔKD (Fig.2). We have shown that both Xhus1 and XATR associate with chromatin in S phase in an initiation-dependent manner (Fig. 3), consistent with their potential roles as checkpoint sensors. Chromatin association of these rad proteins requires the formation of functional pre-RCs, CDK2 activity, and RPA. Interestingly, we have found that pol α is necessary for chromatin association of Xhus1 but not XATR or RPA (Fig. 3), suggesting that XATR associates with RPA-coated ssDNA after initiation, whereas Xhus1 associates with chromatin after pol α is loaded to ssDNA. Previously, we reported that 10 ng/μl of actinomycin D, an RNA primer synthesis inhibitor, inhibited XATR association with chromatin in response to stalled replication (9Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, we have found that under this condition chromatin association of both RPA and pol α is inhibited (data not shown). In light of this observation and the results presented above, our previous conclusion that RNA primer synthesis by pol α is required for chromatin association of XATR is likely incorrect.Interestingly, we have found that binding of XATR and Xhus1 to chromatin is independent of each other (Fig. 4). When this paper was in preparation, other laboratories reported that different checkpoint protein complexes associate with chromatin independently in response to DNA damage in yeast and in human (42Kondo T. Wakayama T. Naiki T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Science. 2001; 294: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 43Melo J.A. Cohen J. Toczyski D.P.

This suggests that these checkpoint Rad proteins may sense replication forks and DNA damage in a similar fashion.Recent structural modeling studies suggest that the Hus1 complex may function like PCNA, a homotrimer closed ring that clamps DNA polymerase δ to DNA (20Thelen M.P. Venclovas C. Fidelis K. Cell. 1999; 96: 769-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Venclovas C. Thelen M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 22Caspari T. Dahlen M. Kanter-Smoler G. Lindsay H.D. Hofmann K. Papadimitriou K. Sunnerhagen P. Carr A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). During replication, PCNA is loaded to primed DNA by RFC (45Mossi R. Hübscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement of pol α for chromatin association of Xhus1 suggests that Xhus1 and PCNA could function in a similar way. Indeed, most recently, Griffith et al. (23Griffith J.D. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15233-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) found that human Hus1, Rad1, and Rad9 form a trimeric PCNA-like ring structure. Nonetheless, the detailed mechanisms on how these proteins function could be different. For example, PCNA loading to chromatin requires DNA primer synthesis by pol α, whereas Xhus1 loading to chromatin probably only requires RNA primer synthesis by the primase activity of pol α because the DNA polymerase activity of pol α does not appear essential for checkpoint activation in the extract (32Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies in yeast also indicate that the PCNA model cannot completely explain the requirements of functional domains in the Hus1-Rad1-Rad9 complex for the replication checkpoint (46Kaur R. Kostrub C.F. Enoch T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3744-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Taken together, our results strongly suggest that following initiation of DNA replication, XATR associates with the RPA-coated ssDNA generated by movement of the MCM helicase. Pol α is also recruited to this ssDNA, and it facilitates the recruitment of Xhus1 to chromatin. This could be mediated either through direct protein-protein interactions with pol α or by association with the RNA-primer synthesized by pol α (32Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Xhus1 may then facilitate Xchk1 phosphorylation either directly by activating XATR through protein-protein interactions, or by recruiting Xchk1 to chromatin (Fig. 5B). Aphidicolin uncouples the DNA helicase activity and DNA polymerase activity, resulting in extensive DNA unwinding (39Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Under this condition, large stretches of ssDNA (as judged by RPA binding) are generated, and binding of RPA and pol α to chromatin is dramatically increased (32Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As a result, more XATR and Xhus1 are recruited to chromatin, and the replication checkpoint is more active (9Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). The DNA replication checkpoint is an inhibitory pathway ensuring that mitosis occurs only after the completion of DNA replication (1Rhind N. Russell P. Curr. Opin.

Moreover, like RFC subunits, Rad17 has a conserved nucleotide-binding domain, and purified human Rad17 complex has ATPase activity that can be stimulated by ssDNA or primed DNA (27Griffiths D.J.

Taken together, these studies have led to the proposal that Rad17, along with RFC subunits, binds to DNA directly and then functions to load the Hus1-Rad1-Rad9 complex onto DNA. The complex, in turn, may facilitate the recruitment and/or activation of other factors. Using a biochemically tractable system, Xenopus egg extract, we have previously shown that the activation of the replication checkpoint requires RNA primer synthesis by the primase of pol α (32Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, this laboratory and others (7Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G.

XATR binds to chromatin specifically in S phase with or without replication inhibitors, suggesting that XATR may monitor ongoing or stalled replication and transmit the checkpoint signal to downstream factors (9Hekmat-Nejad M.

Whether metazoan homologs of other rad proteins are involved in the DNA replication checkpoint has yet to be demonstrated. Moreover, little is known about how these Rad sensor proteins recognize and assemble onto DNA replication substrates. This has been complicated by the fact that checkpoint genes, such as ATR, Hus1, andChk1, are essential for cell viability in mammals (10Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.-S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K.

Using a nucleus-free DNA replication system we have found that immunodepletion of Xhus1 abrogates the replication checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation of Xchk1ΔKD. Chromatin binding assays demonstrate that association of XATR and Xhus1 with chromatin is dependent on initiation of replication. Furthermore, binding of Xhus1 to chromatin is independent of XATR, and binding of XATR is independent of Xhus1. Detailed dissection of the loading requirements shows that initiation of replication in the absence of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA precludes loading of XATR and Xhus1. However, in the absence of pol α, XATR associates with chromatin, whereas Xhus1 fails to bind to chromatin. Overall, our results suggest that XATR binds to RPA-coated single-stranded DNA to form an inactive complex. Following this, the pol α-dependent stable association of Xhus1 with this complex activates the checkpoint pathway. DISCUSSIONWe have cloned the Xenopus homolog of Hus1 (Xhus1) and studied its potential role as a sensor for the DNA replication checkpoint response. Immunodepletion of Xhus1 abolished the checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation of Xchk1ΔKD (Fig.2). We have shown that both Xhus1 and XATR associate with chromatin in S phase in an initiation-dependent manner (Fig. 3), consistent with their potential roles as checkpoint sensors. Chromatin association of these rad proteins requires the formation of functional pre-RCs, CDK2 activity, and RPA. Interestingly, we have found that pol α is necessary for chromatin association of Xhus1 but not XATR or RPA (Fig. 3), suggesting that XATR associates with RPA-coated ssDNA after initiation, whereas Xhus1 associates with chromatin after pol α is loaded to ssDNA. Previously, we reported that 10 ng/μl of actinomycin D, an RNA primer synthesis inhibitor, inhibited XATR association with chromatin in response to stalled replication (9Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, we have found that under this condition chromatin association of both RPA and pol α is inhibited (data not shown). In light of this observation and the results presented above, our previous conclusion that RNA primer synthesis by pol α is required for chromatin association of XATR is likely incorrect.Interestingly, we have found that binding of XATR and Xhus1 to chromatin is independent of each other (Fig. 4). When this paper was in preparation, other laboratories reported that different checkpoint protein complexes associate with chromatin independently in response to DNA damage in yeast and in human (42Kondo T. Wakayama T. Naiki T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Science. 2001; 294: 867-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 43Melo J.A. Cohen J. Toczyski D.P.

This suggests that these checkpoint Rad proteins may sense replication forks and DNA damage in a similar fashion.Recent structural modeling studies suggest that the Hus1 complex may function like PCNA, a homotrimer closed ring that clamps DNA polymerase δ to DNA (20Thelen M.P. Venclovas C. Fidelis K. Cell. 1999; 96: 769-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Venclovas C. Thelen M.P.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1254-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). During replication, PCNA is loaded to primed DNA by RFC (45Mossi R. Hübscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 209-216PubMed Google Scholar). The requirement of pol α for chromatin association of Xhus1 suggests that Xhus1 and PCNA could function in a similar way. Indeed, most recently, Griffith et al. (23Griffith J.D. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15233-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) found that human Hus1, Rad1, and Rad9 form a trimeric PCNA-like ring structure. Nonetheless, the detailed mechanisms on how these proteins function could be different. For example, PCNA loading to chromatin requires DNA primer synthesis by pol α, whereas Xhus1 loading to chromatin probably only requires RNA primer synthesis by the primase activity of pol α because the DNA polymerase activity of pol α does not appear essential for checkpoint activation in the extract (32Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies in yeast also indicate that the PCNA model cannot completely explain the requirements of functional domains in the Hus1-Rad1-Rad9 complex for the replication checkpoint (46Kaur R. Kostrub C.F. Enoch T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3744-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Taken together, our results strongly suggest that following initiation of DNA replication, XATR associates with the RPA-coated ssDNA generated by movement of the MCM helicase. Pol α is also recruited to this ssDNA, and it facilitates the recruitment of Xhus1 to chromatin. This could be mediated either through direct protein-protein interactions with pol α or by association with the RNA-primer synthesized by pol α (32Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Xhus1 may then facilitate Xchk1 phosphorylation either directly by activating XATR through protein-protein interactions, or by recruiting Xchk1 to chromatin (Fig. 5B). Aphidicolin uncouples the DNA helicase activity and DNA polymerase activity, resulting in extensive DNA unwinding (39Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Under this condition, large stretches of ssDNA (as judged by RPA binding) are generated, and binding of RPA and pol α to chromatin is dramatically increased (32Michael W.M. Ott R. Fanning E. Newport J. Science. 2000; 289: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As a result, more XATR and Xhus1 are recruited to chromatin, and the replication checkpoint is more active (9Hekmat-Nejad M. You Z. Yee M. Newport J.W. Cimprich K.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1565-1573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A).

https://openalex.org/W3099494581,"Reconstructing the density fluctuations in the early Universe that evolved into the distribution of galaxies we see today is a challenge to modern cosmology1. An accurate reconstruction would allow us to test cosmological models by simulating the evolution starting from the reconstructed primordial state and comparing it to observations. Several reconstruction techniques have been proposed2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, but they all suffer from lack of uniqueness because the velocities needed to produce a unique reconstruction usually are not known. Here we show that reconstruction can be reduced to a well-determined problem of optimization, and present a specific algorithm that provides excellent agreement when tested against data from N-body simulations. By applying our algorithm to the redshift surveys now under way10, we will be able to recover reliably the properties of the primeval fluctuation field of the local Universe, and to determine accurately the peculiar velocities (deviations from the Hubble expansion) and the true positions of many more galaxies than is feasible by any other method."
https://openalex.org/W2092079502,"The ARF6 GTPase mediates cell shape changes in interphase cells through its effects on membrane cycling and actin remodeling. In this study, we focus our attention on the dynamics of cell division and present evidence supporting a novel role for ARF6 during cleavage furrow ingression and cytokinesis. We demonstrate that endogenous ARF6 redistributes during mitosis and concentrates near the cleavage furrow during telophase. Constitutively activated ARF6 localizes to the plasma membrane at the site of cleavage furrow ingression and midbody formation, and dominant negative ARF6 remains cytoplasmic. By using a novel pull-down assay for ARF6-GTP, we find an abrupt, but transient, increase in ARF6-GTP levels as cells progress through cytokinesis. Whereas high levels of expression of a GTPase-defective ARF6 mutant induce aberrant phenotypes in cells at cytokinesis, cells expressing low levels of ARF6 mutants do not display a significant mitotic delay or cytokinesis defect, presumably due to compensatory or redundant mechanisms that allow cytokinesis to proceed when the ARF6 GTPase cycle is disrupted. Finally, actin accumulation and phospholipid metabolism at the cleavage furrow are unchanged in cells expressing ARF6 mutants, suggesting that ARF6 may be involved in membrane remodeling during cytokinesis via effector pathways that are distinct from those operative in interphase cells."

We examined here whether SR-BI binds directly to PS. A cell line acquired the ability to bind to PS-exposing apoptotic cells and to incorporate PS-containing liposomes when it was forced to express SR-BI. Furthermore, the extracellular domain of rat SR-BI fused with human Fc (SRBIecd-Fc) bound to PS with a dissociation equilibrium constant of 2.4 × 10−7m in a cell-free solid-phase assay, whereas other phospholipids including phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylcholine were poor binding targets. The binding activity was enhanced when CaCl2 was included in the assay or when SRBIecd-Fc was pre-treated with N-glycanase. A portion of the extracellular domain spanning amino acid positions 33 and 191 (numbered with respect to the amino terminus) fused with Fc (SRBI33–191-Fc) showed activity and phospholipid specificity equivalent to those of SRBIecd-Fc.

Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6728) Google Scholar and 21Ellis R.E. Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). This process contributes not only to the clearance of unnecessary or spent cells from the body but also maintaining tissue homeostasis (for review, see Refs. 22Ren Y. Savill J.

Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is, thus, of great importance to elucidate the mechanism underlying phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, which presumably consists of various distinct events such as the migration of phagocytes toward the site of apoptosis, the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, processing of engulfed apoptotic cells in phagocytes, and the alteration of gene expression in engulfing phagocytes. Although investigation of these phenomena (especially the recognition step) has recently become intensive, most mechanisms still remain unclear. Phagocytes such as macrophages bind to apoptotic cells, probably by recognizing phagocytosis marker molecules that are expressed on the surface of target cells (for review, see Refs. 23Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar and 30Savill J. Brit. Med. Bull. 1997; 53: 491-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar); the membrane phospholipid PS is the best-characterized phagocytosis marker (for review, see Refs. 31Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L.

PS, which is normally restricted to the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer, translocates to the outer leaflet and is exposed to the cell surface during apoptosis (for review, see Refs. 35Zachowski A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar and 36Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Mol. Memb.

Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Exposure of PS at the surface of apoptotic cells is easily examined by flow cytometry using fluorescence-labeled annexin V, which specifically binds to PS (37Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M.

Externalized PS serves as a “phagocytosis marker”; that is, phagocytes recognize apoptotic cells by using PS receptors and engulf those cells. We recently showed the occurrence of PS-mediated phagocytosisin vivo; microinjection of annexin V into the seminiferous tubules of live mice inhibited phagocytosis of apoptotic spermatogenic cells by Sertoli cells (29Maeda Y. Shiratsuchi A. Namiki M. Nakanishi Y. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Not only phagocytes that are circulating throughout the body but also tissue-restricted phagocytic cells, sometimes called amateur phagocytes, perform PS-mediated phagocytosis of apoptotic cells; these include microglial cells in the brain, endothelial cells in the blood vessels, and Sertoli cells in the testis. These phagocytes seem to possess distinct PS receptors (34Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), among which lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1) of endothelial cells (44Oka K. Sawamura T.

Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekowitz R.A. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) have so far been reported. The mode of function of those molecules as phagocytosis-inducing PS receptors is mostly unknown, and it has even remained unclear whether or not they directly bind to PS. One exception, the product of growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6), has been shown to specifically bind to PS in a cell-free system (46Nakano T. Ishimoto Y. Kishino J. Umeda M. Inoue K. Nagata K.

J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, Gas6, a non-membrane-anchored protein, is likely to be a kind of adapter and need another membrane protein to transmit the phagocytosis-inducing signal to phagocytes (the Axl/Mer/Tyro3 receptor-tyrosine kinase family of proteins are candidates for such receptors) (47Ishimoto Y.

SR-BI, a member of the scavenger receptor family, has two transmembrane domains and is localized to the caveolae (for review, see Ref. 50Graf G.A. Matveev S.V. Smart E.J. Trends Cardiovas. Med. 1999; 9: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SR-BI is a multiligand receptor whose ligands include relatively simple molecules such as anionic phospholipids and cholesterol esters, more complex molecules such as high density lipoprotein, acetylated or oxidized low density lipoprotein and negatively charged liposomes, and apoptotic cells (for review, see Refs. 51Rigotti A. Trigatti B. Babitt J. Penman M., Xu, S. Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar and 52Krieger M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In the present study, we evaluated the SR-BI activity of binding to PS using a cell-free solid-phase assay. Dispersed testicular cells were prepared from the testes of 20-day-old Donryu rats as described previously (18Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 53Nagao Y. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1989; 25: 1088-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, seminiferous tubules were released from testes by collagenase treatment, and cells in the tubules were dispersed with trypsin. The dispersed cells were seeded on collagen-coated dishes containing F12-L15 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 μg/ml norepinephrine and incubated at 32.5 °C with 5% CO2 in air. Under these conditions, Sertoli cells formed monolayers on the collagen bed, and spermatogenic cells survived being lightly attached to the Sertoli cells. After 3 days, spermatogenic cells were recovered with a purity of greater than 80% (18Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Human leukemic Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in air. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line K1 was cultured in F12 medium containing 10% FBS at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in air. 293T cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line expressing the adenovirusE1 region and SV40 T antigen, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in air. Isolated spermatogenic cells were cultured for 2 days to induce spontaneous apoptosis as previously described (18Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by incubation with doxorubicin (0.3 μg/ml) for 24–31 h as described previously (54Shiratsuchi A. Nakanishi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The extent of apoptosis in both types of cell was monitored by determining chromatin condensation and PS externalization as described previously (18Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J.

Commun. 1997; 234: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was inserted into the expression vector pRC/CMV (Invitrogen) and introduced into CHO-K1 cells by the calcium/phosphate method using standard procedures. Isolated colonies that grew in the presence of G418 (Promega, Madison, WI) were picked and analyzed for the expression of SR-BI by Western blotting with an anti-hamster SR-BI antiserum. Three independent clones that expressed SR-BI at almost the same level were selected and used in the study. Rat spermatogenic cells and Jurkat cells were induced to undergo apoptosis as described above. Cell populations (1 × 106 cells), which were mostly apoptotic but retained plasma membrane integrity, were surface-labeled with biotin (NHS-LC-Biotin, Pierce) and added to rat SR-BI-expressing CHO-K1 cells (4 × 105). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, washed, fixed, and permeabilized as described previously (18Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 54Shiratsuchi A. Nakanishi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The samples were then supplemented with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled avidin (FITC-avidin D; Vector, Burlingame, CA) and examined under a fluorescence and phase-contrast microscope. The number of SR-BI-expressing cells with fluorescent cells either attached or incorporated was determined and expressed relative to the total number of SR-BI-expressing cells (in percentage). The mean and S.D. of a typical example from at least two independent experiments that yielded similar results are presented. Liposomes were formed using either phosphatidylcholine (PC) only (PC liposomes) or a combination of PC and PS at a molar ratio of 7:3 (PS liposomes) as described previously (18Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-labeled liposomes were prepared with N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) as 1% of total phospholipids. SR-BI-expressing CHO-K1 cells were incubated with fluorescence-labeled PS liposomes at 37 °C for 1 h, washed, and examined by flow cytometry for incorporation of the liposomes as described previously (18Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A portion of rat SR-BI cDNA corresponding to the entire extracellular domain (SRBIecd) was inserted into the vector pEF-BOS-Vα′-Fc so that the SR-BI sequence was fused with the human T cell receptor-derived signal peptide at the amino terminus and with the human IgG Fc region at the carboxyl terminus, and this DNA was introduced into 293T cells by the calcium/phosphate method. DNA fragments corresponding to various portions of SRBIecd were synthesized by PCR and expressed in 293T cells as above. The transfectants were cultured in the presence of 10% FBS (ultra-low IgG FBS; Invitrogen), and culture media were collected after 4 days. SR-BI proteins fused with Fc were purified using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The extracellular domain of human Axl (48Nagata K. Ohashi K. Nakano T. Arita H. Zong C. Hanafusa H. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30022-30027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) was similarly prepared as an Fc fusion protein (Axlecd-Fc) and used in the PS binding assay as a negative control. For the solid-phase assay, phospholipids diluted with ethanol were added to 96-well plastic plates (MS-8496F; Sumitomo Bakelite, Tokyo, Japan) (0.3 μg/well) and left to dry at room temperature. Recombinant Fc fusion proteins were added to the wells that had been treated with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl) containing 3% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V; Sigma) for blocking, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and washed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The wells were supplemented successively with an anti-human IgG Fc antibody (Cappel, Aurora, OH) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then subjected to a colorimetric reaction usingo-phenylenediamine. The amount of the reaction products was determined by measuring A490. We first conducted the reactions with no added proteins to determine background levels, which were almost negligible with any phospholipids. Binding of the Fc-fused proteins to plates either coated or not coated with phospholipids was then measured, the background value was subtracted from the differential between these two reactions, and the result was taken as the score of specific binding. Kinetic parameters for the binding of Fc-fused proteins to PS were determined using IAsys, an optical evanescence resonant mirror cuvette system, with the software FASTplot and Grafit (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK). For examination of the binding of SR-BI to cells with externalized PS, Jurkat cells (1 × 105) that had been treated with doxorubicin were incubated with the fusion protein containing a region corresponding to amino acid residues 33–191 (SRBI33–191-Fc) (numbered from the amino terminus) (0.55 mg/ml) or Axlecd-Fc (1.0 mg/ml) on ice for 30 min. The mixture was supplemented with a FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Immunotech, Marseilles, France) and incubated on ice for another 30 min. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and examined under a fluorescence microscope. Protein samples were incubated with N-glycanase (Glyko, Novato, CA) at 37 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 50 mm EDTA (normal conditions). To obtain more complete digestion, the samples were pretreated with 0.3% SDS and 0.15m 2-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 3 min and incubated with the enzyme in the presence of 1.5% Nonidet P-40 (denaturing conditions). The samples treated with the enzyme were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or Western blotting or by the PS binding assay. Protein samples including cells and culture media were solubilized in a buffer consisting of 0.0625m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2.5% SDS, and 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Each sample was separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% dry skim milk, incubated with either an anti-SR-BI antiserum or an anti-human IgG Fc antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dry skim milk, and washed. It was then reacted with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad) or an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the signals were visualized using the Immun-Star system (Bio-Rad). Microinjection into the seminiferous tubules of live mice (ddY, 10–15 weeks old) was carried out according to the method of Ogawa et al. (55Ogawa T. Aréchaga J.M. Avarbock M.R. Brinster R.L. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar) with modification (29Maeda Y. Shiratsuchi A. Namiki M. Nakanishi Y. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 742-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Phosphate-buffered saline (50–80 μl) containing 2 mm CaCl2, 0.05% trypan blue, and SRBI33–191-Fc (16 or 25 μm) was injected through the efferent duct. The microinjection was considered to be successful when more than half of the seminiferous tubules were stained blue. Testes were isolated after 0.5, 1, 3, and 7 days, immersed successively in phosphate-buffered saline containing paraformaldehyde and sucrose, and embedded with OCT compound (Sakura Finechemical, Tokyo, Japan) on dry ice/ethanol. The testes were then frozen-sectioned at 10-μm thickness, treated with paraformaldehyde, then with ethanol/acetic acid. The sections were further treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide and subjected to the TUNEL assay using a commercial kit (ApopTag; Intergen, Purchase, NY). Signals were visualized by a coloring reaction with horseradish peroxidase and 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, and the samples were examined by microscopy after counterstaining with methyl green. An anti-hamster SR-BI antiserum that had been raised against 45 amino acid residues located at the carboxyl terminus was kindly provided by H. Arai. To generate an anti-rat SR-BI antiserum, the synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 110–132 of rat SR-BI (19Shiratsuchi A. Kawasaki Y. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol.

In a previous study, we showed that Sertoli cell-derived cell lines showed increased activity of both incorporating PS liposomes and phagocytosing apoptotic spermatogenic cells when they were transfected with rat SR-BI cDNA (19Shiratsuchi A. Kawasaki Y. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5901-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, the interpretation of the results was rather complicated since those cell lines contained significant amounts of endogenous SR-BI. We therefore conducted similar experiments using CHO-K1 cells, which express only trace levels of SR-BI. Rat SR-BI cDNA was introduced into CHO-K1 cells, and three clones that expressed SR-BI protein at almost the same level were isolated; an example of the analysis of one of the clones is shown in Fig. 1A. These cell clones gave essentially the same results in subsequent experiments, and therefore, only results obtained with a representative clone are shown. When SR-BI-expressing CHO-K1 cells were mixed with apoptotic spermatogenic cells or Jurkat cells, efficient binding of the two cell types was observed (Fig. 1B). However, in contrast to the results of our previous experiments with Sertoli-derived cell lines (19Shiratsuchi A. Kawasaki Y. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5901-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), phagocytosis occurred only with reduced efficiency (data not shown). We therefore determined the extent of association of the t"

Here, we report that two structurally unrelated proteins, theEscherichia coli mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase (MUG) and the human alkylpurine-DNA-N-glycosylase (ANPG), can release 1,N 2-εG from defined oligonucleotides containing a single modified base. A comparison of the kinetic constants of the reaction indicates that the MUG protein removes the 1,N 2-εG lesion more efficiently (kcat/Km = 0.95 × 10−3 min−1 nm−1) than the ANPG protein (kcat/Km = 0.1 × 10−3 min−1 nm−1). Additionally, while the nonconserved, N-terminal 73 amino acids of the ANPG protein are not required for activity on 1,N 6-ethenoadenine, hypoxanthine, orN-methylpurines, we show that they are essential for 1,N 2-εG-DNA glycosylase activity. Both the MUG and ANPG proteins preferentially excise 1,N 2-εG when it is opposite dC; however, unlike MUG, ANPG is unable to excise 1,N 2-εG when it is opposite dG. Using cell-free extracts from genetically modified E. coli and murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking MUG and mANPG activity, respectively, we show that the incision of the 1,N 2-εG-containing duplex oligonucleotide has an absolute requirement for MUG or ANPG.

Taken together these observations suggest a possible role for these proteins in counteracting the genotoxic effects of 1,N 2-εG residues in vivo. etheno 3,N4-ethenocytosine 1,N6-ethenoadenine 3-εG,N2,3-ethenoguanine N2-εG, 1,N2-ethenoguanine human alkylpurine-DNAN-glycosylase mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase human thymine-DNA glycosylase E. coli 3-methyladenine-DNA-glycosylase II electrophoretic mobility shift assay mouse embryonic fibroblasts murine ANPG rat ANPG The etheno (ε)1 ring system is formed by the attack of reactive bifunctional epoxides or aldehydes at a nitrogen of the DNA base, followed by dehydration and ring closure (1Bolt H.M. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1988; 18: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Guengerich F.P. Min K.S. Persmark M. Kim M.S. Humphreys W.G. Cmarik J.L. IARC Sci. Publ. 1994; 125: 57-72Google Scholar). The ε-derivatives of purine and pyrimidine bases (e.g. 1,N 6-ethenoadenine (εA),N 2,3-ethenoguanine (N 2,3-εG), 1,N 2-ethenoguanine (1,N 2-εG), and 3,N 4-ethenocytosine (εC)) are generated in cellular DNA by reaction with epoxides that result from the metabolism of various industrial pollutants. The highly mutagenic and genotoxic properties of ε-adducts have been established in vitro by analyzing steady-state kinetics of primer extension assays and in vivo by site-specific mutagenesis in mammalian cells (3Singer B.

Toxicol. 1999; 12: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The increasing interest in exocyclic DNA adducts has been triggered by the discovery that they can be formed by endogenous processes through the interaction of lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes and hydroxyalkenals with DNA (8Chung F.L. Chen H.J. Nath R.G. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2105-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 9Bartsch H. IARC Sci. Publ. 1999; 150: 1-16Google Scholar). ε-adducts are ubiquitous and have been found in DNA isolated from tissues of untreated rodents and human controls (10Nair J. Barbin A. Guichard Y. Bartsch H. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, εA and εC levels were significantly increased by cancer risk factors contributing to oxidative stress/lipid peroxidation, such as dietary w-6 fatty acid intake, chronic infections, and inflammatory conditions (11Bartsch H. Nair J. Toxicology. 2000; 153: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These findings strongly suggest that exocyclic DNA adducts, together with other forms of oxidative DNA damage, play a role in the multistage process of human carcinogenesis, in which persistent oxidative stress is increasingly recognized as a driving force toward malignancy. Although 1,N 2-εG is yet to be detected in genomic DNA, possibly due to the lack of an appropriate detection method, it was found to be the major guanine adduct formed in reactions of lipid peroxidation products with DNA in vitro (Fig.1) (12Morinello E.J. Ham A.J. Ranasinghe A. Sangaiah R. Swenberg J.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). While 1,N 2-εG is a moderate DNA polymerase-blocking lesion in vitro (13Langouët S. Müller M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6069-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) widely differing misincorporation frequencies opposite 1,N 2-εG have been observed both with in vitro assays and in Escherichia coli (13Langouët S. Müller M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6069-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Langouet S. Mican A.N. Muller M. Fink S.P. Marnett L.J. Muhle S.A. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5184-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of 1,N 2-εG in chromosomal DNA of Chinese hamster ovary cells induces deletions, rearrangements, double mutants, and base pair substitutions (7Akasaka S. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, as all ε-adducts are potentially mutagenic, mechanisms should exist for their removal from DNA. Indeed the repair of εA andN 2,3-εG adducts in DNA by DNA glycosylases present in rat cell extracts was first described over fifteen years ago (15Oesch F. Adler S. Rettelbach R. Doerjer G. IARC Sci. Publ. 1986; 70: 373-379Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that this activity is associated with mammalian alkylpurine-DNA-N-glycosylases (ANPG) (16Singer B. Antoccia A. Basu A.K. Dosanjh M.K. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Gallagher P.E. Kusmierek J.T. Qiu Z.H. Rydberg B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9386-9390Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The purified AlkA protein from E. coli has also been shown to release εA and N 2,3-εG when present in DNA (17Matijasevic Z. Sekiguchi M. Ludlum D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9331-9334Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Saparbaev M. Kleibl K. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3750-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). For εC, it has been shown that both the E. coli mismatch-specific uracil-DNA glycosylase (MUG) and its structural and functional homolog in human cells, thymine-DNA glycosylase (hTDG) can release this exocyclic pyrimidine from DNA (19Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar,20Hang B. Medina M. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Singer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13561-13566Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also shown that the human mismatch-specific DNAN-glycosylase (MED1/MBD4) has a weak εC-DNA glycosylase activity (21Petronzelli F. Riccio A. Markham G.D. Seeholzer S.H. Genuardi M. Karbowski M. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Bellacosa A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Human ANPG is a monofunctional N-glycosylase that releases a variety of structurally unrelated bases from DNA. In addition to theN-methylpurines, we have shown previously that ANPG efficiently excises εA when present in DNA (Km 24 nm and kcat 0.05 min−1) (18Saparbaev M. Kleibl K. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3750-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 22Saparbaev M. Laval J. IARC Sci. Publ. 1999; 150: 249-261Google Scholar) and hypoxanthine (Km 6 nm andkcat 0.21 min−1) (23Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24Saparbaev M. Mani J.C. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1332-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It should be stressed that the ANPG and AlkA proteins, in contrast to the MUG and hTDG proteins, are not able to excise εC (19Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Hang B. Chenna A. Rao S. Singer B. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similarly, the MUG and hTDG proteins do not release εA from DNA (18Saparbaev M. Kleibl K. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3750-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar,26Hang B.

Laval, unpublished observations. Two alternatively spliced transcripts of human ANPG have been isolated from human cells. The full-length cDNA first isolated by Samson et al.(ANPG70, 293 amino acids) (38Samson L. Derfler B. Boosalis M. Call K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9127-9131Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) differs from the splice variant (ANPG60, 298 amino acids) (44Pendlebury A. Frayling I.M. Santibane Zkoref M.F. Margison G.P. Rafferty J.A. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2957-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) only in the sequence of the first eight and 13 N-terminal amino-acids respectively. Two truncated versions of human ANPG have also been described: ANPG40 lacks the first 63 amino acids and ANPG80 the first 73 amino acids from the N terminus when compared with APNG70 (33O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5561-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 48Lau A.Y. Schrärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Dosanjh and co-workers have shown that partially purified HeLa extracts can release εA and 1,N 2-εG (16Singer B. Antoccia A. Basu A.K. Dosanjh M.K. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Gallagher P.E. Kusmierek J.T. Qiu Z.H. Rydberg B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9386-9390Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, because a cell extract was used, it was unclear whether the two ε-adducts were repaired by a single enzyme. In the present study using highly purified proteins, we have shown that MUG and ANPG can release 1,N 2-εG from a 1,N 2-εG-monosubstituted duplex oligonucleotide and that this activity was absent in extracts of E. coli mug mutants. Furthermore, as the murine ANPG protein (APNG/Aag) (27Engelward B.P. Boosalis M.S. Chen B.J. Deng Z. Siciliano M.J. Samson L.D. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) shares significant sequence and functional homology with ANPG (28Wyatt M.D. Allan J.M. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T.E. Samson L.D. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we have used cell-free extracts from normal and APNG-deficient mice (29Elder R.H. Jansen J.G. Weeks R.J. Willington M.A. Deans B. Watson A.J. Mynett K.J. Bailey J.A. Cooper D.P. Rafferty J.A Heeran M.C. Wijnhoven S.W. van Zeeland A.A. Margison G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5828-5837Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to confirm that APNG is the only 1,N 2-εGN-glycosylase present in mouse cells under the experimental conditions used. These observations suggest a possible role for these proteins in vivo to counteract the genotoxic effects of 1,N 2-εG adducts. Oligonucleotides containing single 1,N 2-εG residues at position X were prepared as described by Langouët et al. (13Langouët S. Müller M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6069-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were purified by ion exchange chromatography on a 7.5 × 50 mm Vydac Ion Exchange column (The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) using a 0–300 mm NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) (flow rate 1 ml/min). The peak fractions were collected and desalted using 1.2 × 30 cm Sephadex G-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) using H2O as the solvent. The recovered oligonucleotides (monitored usingA260) were ∼90% pure as judged by capillary electrophoresis (Beckman PACE 5000, Beckman, Fullerton, CA) (13Langouët S. Müller M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6069-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Further purification was achieved by preparative electrophoresis through a 16% (w/v) acrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 50 mm sodium 3-(N-morphilino)propanesulfonate (13Langouët S. Müller M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6069-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The oligomers were eluted from the gel, concentrated by centrifugal evaporation and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a Perseptives Voyager instrument in the Vanderbilt facility. The matrix was an 8:1 (v/v) mixture composed of (i) 3-hydroxypicolinic acid (50 mg/ml) in CH3CN-H2O, 1:1, v/v and (ii) aqueous ammonium citrate (50 mg/ml). The measured Mr of the εG30 oligonucleotide was 9302.0 ± 1.6 (mean of five measurements, calculated 9302), and the Mr of the εG31 oligonucleotide was 9503.85 ± 4.0 (mean of six measurements, calculated 9504): εG30 5′-d(TGACTGCATA X GCATGTAGACGATGTGCAT and εG31 5′-d(TACATCGTCACCTGGG X CATGTTGCAGATCC). These sequence contexts were previously used to study the repair of a thymine fragmentation product (30Jurado J. Saparbaev M. Matray T.J. Laval J. Greenberg M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7757-7763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Privezentzev C.V. Saparbaev M. Sambandam A. Greenberg M.M. Laval J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14263-14268Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and hypoxanthine (23Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Four complementary oligonucleotides containing dA, dG, dC, or T at the position opposite to 1,N 2-εG were purchased from Eurogentec (Angers, France). The resulting duplex oligonucleotides are referred to as εG30·C(G,A,T) and εG31·C(G,A,T), respectively. Oligonucleotides were 5′-end labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) or 3′-end labeled by terminal transferase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of the [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturers. The oligonucleotides were then annealed to the appropriate complements as previously described (24Saparbaev M. Mani J.C. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1332-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The E. coli isogenic strains JM105 WT and MS1050 mug were from laboratory stock. Isolation of an εC-DNA glycosylase (mug)-deficient mutant of E. coli K12, generated by insertion of a kanamycin cassette, will be published elsewhere. A Southern blot of genomic DNA from the mug mutant confirmed the insertion of the kanamycin cassette, whereas crude lysates exhibited no detectable εC-DNA glycosylase activity (data not shown). Purification of the E. coli UNG, TagI (E. coli 3-methyladenine-DNA-glycosylase I), AlkA, MUG, Fpg (E. coli formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase), Nth (E. coli endonuclease III), Nfo (E. coli endonuclease IV), and human TDG proteins was performed as described (19Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8508-8513Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The following recombinant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BH290 (tag, alkA) cells and purified to apparent homogeneity: ANPG40 (26 kDa, 230 amino acids) (32O'Connor T.R. Laval J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), ANPG60 (32 kDa, 298 amino acids), ANPG70 (32 kDa, 293 amino acids) (33O'Connor T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5561-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and rat APDG (27.9 kDa, 253 amino acids) (34O'Connor T.R. Laval F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3337-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding ANPG80, a truncated variant lacking the N-terminal 73 amino acids (24.4 kDa, 220 amino acids) (48Lau A.Y. Schrärer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.

Purification of ANPG80 was achieved using three chromatographic steps: AcA54 gel filtration (IBF, Villeneuve-la-Garenne, France), phenyl-Sepharose, and sulfopropyl-Sepharose cation exchange (Amersham Biosciences). The purification of hOGG1 and HAP-1 proteins was performed as described (35Roldan-Arjona T. Wei Y.F. Carter K.C. Klungland A. Anselmino C. Wang R.P. Augustus M. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Human Nth1 protein was generously provided by Dr. R. Roy (American Health Foundation, Valhalla, NY). The activity of the various proteins was tested using their well defined substrates and checked just prior to their use. The release of 1,N 2-εG base adducts was measured by the cleavage of the oligonucleotide containing a single lesion at a defined position. The standard assay mixture for base excision activity (20 μl final volume) contained 0.2 pmol of the 5′-[32P] or 3′-[32P]dCMP-end labeled oligonucleotide duplex in 70 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and limiting amounts of enzyme. For MUG, AlkA, and hTDG the incubation mixture was not supplemented with 100 mm KCl. For Nfo and HAP-1 the reaction buffer (20 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (or 5 mm MgCl2 for the HAP-1), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 60 min unless otherwise stated. Abasic sites were incised after glycosylase action by light piperidine treatment (10% (v/v) piperidine at 37 °C for 15 min). Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis through denaturing 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (7 m urea, 0.5× TBE), visualized by PhosphorImager Storm 840 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and quantified using ImageQuant software. The standard binding reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 70 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.8), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml, 2 pmol G·C oligonucleotide duplex as nonspecific DNA, 0.2 pmol 5′-[32P]-labeled 1,N 2-εG·C oligonucleotide duplex, and 2 pmol of a given repair protein unless otherwise stated. Following incubation on ice for 30 min, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was analyzed by electrophoresis through a 10% (w/v) nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) containing 0.5× TBE at 100 V at 4 °C for 15 h. Gels were then exposed to a Storm 840 Phosphor Screen and the amount of radioactivity in the bands was quantified using ImageQuaNTTMsoftware. The E. colicell-free extracts were prepared from cultures at OD600 = 1.0 as described previously (37Boiteux S. O'Connor T.R. Laval J. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3177-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were derived from APNG+/+ and APNG−/− mice as previously described (29Elder R.H. Jansen J.G. Weeks R.J. Willington M.A. Deans B. Watson A.J. Mynett K.J. Bailey J.A. Cooper D.P. Rafferty J.A Heeran M.C. Wijnhoven S.W. van Zeeland A.A. Margison G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5828-5837Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The MEFs were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until confluent. Cells were recovered by treatment with trypsin-EDTA, pelleted by centrifugation, snap-frozen in solid CO2 and stored at −80 °C until used. For the preparation of cell-free extracts by sonication, the cell pellets were first washed with phosphate-buffered saline and, after centrifugation, resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m KCl, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 5% glycerol (v/v), and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The sonicated extract was centrifuged, and enzyme activity in the supernatant was determined as described above. To study the repair of 1,N 2-εG in DNA, we investigated whether this lesion was a substrate for previously characterized DNA repair enzymes. We challenged a 5′-[32P]-labeled oligonucleotide duplex containing 1,N 2-εG with a variety of highly purified base excision repair enzymes. The εG30·C and εG31·C duplex oligonucleotides containing 1,N 2-εG in a different sequence context were employed as substrates. Because not all base excision repair glycosylases possess apurinic-nicking activity, the samples were treated with piperidine after the DNA glycosylase reaction to cleave DNA at the potential abasic sites generated by the reaction. When the various E. coli and human DNA glycosylases were tested on the εG31·C (Fig. 2), only incubation with MUG, ANPG70, or APDG led to the cleavage of the labeled oligonucleotide at the position of the modified base. Interestingly, the excision of 1,N 2-εG by the bacterial enzyme was more efficient than that of the mammalian enzymes (Fig. 2,lanes 5 and 10–11). Moreover, the human enzyme was more efficient than rat ADPG (Fig. 2, lanes 10 and11). Despite being present in excess amount, UNG, Tag, AlkA, Fpg, Nth, Nfo, hTDG, hNth1 (human endonuclease III), hOGG1, and HAP-1 proteins did not act on the εG31·C (Fig. 2, lanes 2–4,6–9, and 12–14). Similar results were obtained with the εG30·C oligonucleotide, indicating that 1,N 2-εG-DNA glycosylase is not affected by the sequence context (data not shown). Furthermore, the MUG and ANPG70 proteins excise 1,N 2-εG in a dose-dependent manner, and the release of the adduct was linear as a function of time during the first 20 and 60 min of incubation, respectively (data not shown). εG—Because ANPG may exist in a number of alternative forms in human cells, resulting from differential splicing of the primary transcript, we studied the release of 1,N 2-εG by various forms of the ANPG protein. As shown in Fig. 3, MUG, ANPG-70, -60, and -40 (lanes 2–4, 6, 8–10, and12) excise 1,N 2-εG when it is present in the εG30·C and εG31·C duplex oligonucleotides, generating 10- and 16-mer DNA fragments, respectively. Surprisingly, ANPG80, although used in excess amounts to detect even marginal activity, did not act on the εG30·C and εG31·C duplexes under our experimental conditions (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and11). We examined the interaction of the εG31·C-containing duplex oligonucleotide with, MUG, hTDG, AlkA, ANPG-70, -60, -40, and -80, Nfo, Nth, hNth1, and hOGG1 using EMSA, which can be used to detect the difference in migration pattern between free and protein-bound DNA. To avoid nonspecific interactions the standard binding mixture contained a 17-fold excess of albumin and a 10-fold excess of unlabeled, non-modified 34-mer G·C duplex oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig.4 the MUG protein interacted in a highly specific manner with εG31·C-containing DNA, with more than 80% of the labeled DNA present as the bound form (lane 2). In contrast, Nfo and the various forms of ANPG interacted very weakly with εG31·C, because less than 10% of labeled DNA was present in bound form (Fig. 4, lanes 5–9). It should be noted that the full-length ANPG70 and truncated ANPG80 proteins bound to the εG31·C duplex with the same efficiency. This observation ruled out the possibility that the inability of the ANPG80 protein to catalyze glycosidic bond hydrolysis of the 1,N 2-εG adduct in DNA resulted from a failure of the enzyme to bind to this substrate. As expected the AlkA, hTDG, Nth, hNth1, and hOGG1 proteins did not form specific complexes with εG31·C-containing DNA. Interestingly, although Nfo protein does not excise the 1,N 2-εG residue in DNA it binds to εG31·C duplex oligonucleotide in our assay condition. To demonstrate binding specificity, increasing amounts of either unlabeled nonspecific G·C or specific εG31·C duplex oligonucleotides were titrated into binding reactions of the MUG, ANPG70, ANPG80, and Nfo proteins with the32P-labeled 1,N 2-εG oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 5(lane 12), a 10-fold molar excess of the cold εG31·C duplex oligonucleotide efficiently inhibits complex formation by the MUG protein, whereas little inhibition was observed with the same amount of the cold G·C DNA. The binding of the ANPG70, ANPG80, and Nfo proteins to the 1,N 2-εG was inhibited equally well by the cold G·C and εG31·C duplex oligonucleotides (data not shown), suggesting that the interactions observed in Fig. 4are rather nonspecific. In conclusion, the data show that among proteins tested only MUG interacts in a highly specific manner with the 1,N 2-εG adduct in DNA.Figure 5Specificity of MUG protein binding to the 1,N 2-εG adduct in DNA. Unlabeled duplex oligonucleotide (with or without adduct) was titrated into binding reaction mixtures containing 10 nm of 5′-[32P]-labeled εG31·C duplex oligonucleotide and 100 nm of MUG at 4 °C for 10 min. Lane 1, control εG31·C; lane 2, as lane 1 but in presence of MUG; lanes 3–8, as lane 2 but in presence of 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 600 nmunlabeled G·C oligonucleotide; lane 9, as lane 1 but in presence of MUG; lanes 10–15, as lane 9 but in presence of 25 nm, 50 nm, 100 nm, 200 nm, 400 nm, and 600 nm unlabeled εG31·C oligonucleotide. The reaction products were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” a, enzyme-bound oligonucleotide;b, free oligonucleotide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based upon the above qualitative observations, we further investigated the efficiencies of MUG and the various active forms of ANPG to recognize 1,N 2-εG in DNA. The Km andkcat values and thekcat/Km ratios for the MUG and ANPG-70, -60, and -40 proteins acting on 1,N 2-εG are shown in TableI. For comparison, the respective kinetic constants for these proteins acting on their other well characterized substrates (εC and εA) are also presented. Interestingly, the apparent Km for MUG, calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot (11 nm), suggests that MUG has stronger affinity than does the ANPG proteins (Table I). The comparison of the kinetic constants for the excision of 1,N 2-εG shows a dramatic difference among the four enzymes used, the bacterial one being by far the most efficient, whereas the efficiency of repair by ANPG proteins is much lower. Moreover, the analysis of the kinetic constants of the various forms of human enzymes suggests that the biologically active protein for the excision of 1,N 2-εG in vivo is most probably the full-length and splicing variant proteins. However, it is also worth noting that the kinetic constants of the MUG and ANPG proteins for excision of the εC and εA, respectively, are more efficient.Table IKinetic constants of the E. coli MUG and various human ANPG proteins for the excision of ɛ-basesEnzymeSubstrateKakcatkcat/Kmnmmin −1(min−1nm −1) × 10−3MUG1,N 2ɛG/C10.8 ± 3.60.010.95ɛC/G1-bResults from Ref. 19.2.5 ± 1.60.95 ± 0.22380ANPG70 293 residues Full-length variantI, N 2ɛG/C25.1 ± 0.82.6 × 10−30.10ANPG60 298 residues Splice variant1,N 2ɛG/C26.4 ± 5.02.9 × 10−30.11ANPG40 230 residues1,N 2ɛG/C31.2 ± 1.30.6 × 10−30.02Truncated variant1-cTruncated version lacks the first 63 amino acids from the N terminus.ɛA/T1-dResults from Ref. 22.2450"

A screen for yeast genes affecting MPA sensitivity, when overexpressed, allowed us to identify two genes, IMD2 and TPO1, encoding a homologue of IMP dehydrogenase and a vacuolar pump, respectively. In parallel, 4787 yeast strains, each carrying an identified knock-out mutation, were tested for growth in the presence of MPA, allowing identification of 100 new genes affecting MPA resistance when disrupted. Disturbance of several cellular processes, such as ergosterol biosynthesis, vacuole biogenesis, or glycosylation impaired the natural capacity of yeast to resist MPA, although most of the highly sensitive mutants affected the transcription machinery (19 mutants). Expression of TPO1and/or IMD2 was strongly affected in 16 such transcription mutants suggesting that low expression of these genes could contribute to MPA sensitivity. Interestingly, the spt3,spt8, and spt20 mutants behaved differently than other Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) mutants. Indeed, in these three mutants, as in previously characterized transcription elongation mutants, IMD2 expression was only affected in the presence of MPA, thus suggesting a possible role for some SAGA subunits in transcription elongation.

MPA is a specific inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in GMP biosynthesis. Mammalian IMPDH has been crystallized in the presence of MPA (1Sintchak M.D. Fleming M.A. Futer O. Raybuck S.A. Chambers S.P. Caron P.R. Murcko M.A. Wilson K.P. Cell. 1996; 85: 921-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). MPA is also toxic for yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (2Escobar-Henriques M. Balguerie A. Monribot C.

Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and residues involved in MPA-IMPDH interaction in the mammalian enzyme are conserved in the yeast IMPDH homologues encoded by three genes named IMD2,IMD3, and IMD4. A few mutations that increase yeast sensitivity to MPA had been identified previously; these affect proteins such as TFIIS, Rpb2p, Rtf1p, Rpb9p, or Paf1p that are required for optimal transcription elongation (3Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 4Powell W. Reines D. J. Biol.

More recently, a deletion of IMD2 was shown to confer MPA hypersensitivity, but deletion of either IMD3 or IMD4 had no major effect (8Shaw R.J. Wilson J.L. Smith K.T. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32905-32916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because GMP and its derivatives (GDP, GTP, and dGTP) are essential precursors and effectors, it was highly probable that MPA, by affecting GMP synthesis, would interfere with multiple cellular processes. Indeed, we have recently shown that MPA, through inhibition of IMPDH activity, affects DNA content, cell size and polarization (2Escobar-Henriques M. Balguerie A. Monribot C. Boucherie H. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46237-46242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the same study, a proteome analysis combined with overexpression studies allowed the identification of important secondary targets of MPA, such as Cdc37p and Sup45p, which are involved in cell cycle progression and translation, respectively (2Escobar-Henriques M. Balguerie A. Monribot C. Boucherie H. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46237-46242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the cellular processes affected by MPA treatment, we have now screened for yeast genes leading to altered resistance to MPA when overexpressed or mutated. We took advantage of a unique yeast mutant collection, which we named “disruptome,” made of 4787 individual knock-out mutations, covering most of the yeast non-essential genes, to identify new genes affecting resistance to MPA. This systematic analysis, at the genomic scale, allowed us to identify new cellular functions affected by MPA treatment. The following yeast strains were used: Y350 (MATα; ura3–52; leu2–3,112; lys2Δ201), BY4742 (MATα; his3Δ1; leu2Δ0; lys2Δ0; ura3Δ0). The set of 4787 isogenic disrupted strains purchased from Euroscarf were derived from BY4742. The SC and SD media used were as described (9Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). SD casaW is SD supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids (Difco) and tryptophan (40 mg/liter). SD casaWU is SD casaW supplemented with uracil (200 mg/liter). Guanine was added optionally at a final concentrations of 0.13 mm. Mycophenolic acid and 6-azauracil (6AU) were purchased from Sigma. Subcloning of the P1736 plasmid carrying theIMD2 region in YEp13 was done as follows. An ApaI 5.06-kpb fragment containing the IMD2 gene was deleted from the original P1736 plasmid. The resulting plasmid was named P1831. To construct P1829, a 7-kpb BbuI restriction fragment was deleted from plasmid P1736. Finally, P1937 was constructed by introducing a kanamycin-resistance cassette in the IMD2 gene at the unique BamH1 restriction site. Subcloning of the plasmid carrying the TPO1 region was done as follows. First,TPO1 was partially deleted from P1981 by removing theKpnI-KpnI 1.61-kbp fragment (P1996). Second, theTPO1 gene was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and cloned in YEpLac195 (URA3, 2 μm) (10Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) using theBamH1 and HindIII restriction sites in the primer sequences. The synthetic oligonucleotides used were as follows: 453, 5′-CGCGGATCCTACTCTTGTCGCTTGTGCATAG-3′; 454, 5′-TAACCAGGCACCAGTAGTACT-3′. Yeast strain were grown overnight in SD casaWU to an A600 = 1, and the culture was then supplemented or not with 5 mg/liter MPA and grown for 1 more hour. RNA were isolated using the TRI-Reagent RNA/DNA/Protein Isolation Reagent (Euromedex). RNA blots were prepared and probed (11Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with labeled PCR fragments, amplified from the S288C genomic DNA template with the following pairs of oligonucleotides: IMD2, 155, 5′-TTTTTGCATGCCGCCATTAGAGACTAC-3′, and 19, 5′-TCCCCCGGGCCCAAATACCGTA-3′; TPO1, 453, 5′-CGCGGATCCTACTCTTGTGCTTGTGCATAG-3′, and 454, 5′-TAACCAGGCACCAGTAGTACT-3′; PDA1, 575, 5′-TGTCGCACCTGTATCTTCAC-3′, and 576, 5′-AGCGTAAAGGTGCATGGAAC-3′. Quantification of radioactive spots was performed using a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant analysis software (AmershamBiosciences). As a first step toward identification of genes affecting resistance to MPA, a yeast wild-type strain (Y350) was transformed with a genomic library in the multicopy YEp13 vector (12Daignan-Fornier B. Reisdorf P. NGuyen C.C. Lemeignan B. Bolotin-Fukuhara M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and plated directly on SC medium containing MPA (100 mg/liter). Plasmids from three yeast MPA resistant transformants were purified inEscherichia coli and shown to confer MPA resistance when retransformed in yeast. Sequence of the plasmid inserts revealed that they all contained a fragment of chromosome VIII carrying theIMD2 gene encoding an isoform of IMP dehydrogenase, the enzyme inhibited by MPA. One of these plasmids (P1736) was studied further, and overexpression of IMD2 was shown to be responsible for MPA resistance by subcloning experiments (Fig1A). Because this overexpression screen allowed identification of a single gene, a second experiment was carried out with a different genomic library to increase the overall representativity of the screen. The wild-type BY4742 strain transformed with a multicopy library, constructed in the PFL44L vector (URA3, 2 μm), allowed isolation of two plasmids clearly conferring MPA resistance. Both plasmids contained a fragment of chromosome XII, and further subcloning experiments revealed that the previously characterized TPO1 gene (13Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) was responsible for MPA resistance (Fig. 1B). This gene encodes a multidrug-resistance protein of the major facilitator superfamily (14Goffeau A. Park J. Paulsen I.T. Jonniaux J.L. Dinh T. Mordant P. Saier M.H., Jr. Yeast. 1997; 13: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), recently characterized as a vacuolar membrane protein involved in polyamine transport (13Tomitori H. Kashiwagi K. Sakata K. Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3265-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Homologues of both IMD2 andTPO1 have been shown to affect MPA resistance in other yeast species. Indeed, overexpression of Candida albicans IMPDH leads to MPA resistance (15Kohler G.A. White T.C. Agabian N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas knock-out of FLU1, encoding a protein highly similar to Tpo1p, makes C. albicans more sensitive to MPA (16Calabrese D. Bille J. Sanglard D. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2743-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Similarly, a S. cerevisiae tpo1 mutant strain was slightly more sensitive to MPA than the wild-type strain (data not shown). We also found that concomitant overexpression of IMD2 andTPO1 did not lead to additive resistance to MPA (Fig.1C). We then intended to determine whether overexpression of IMD3and IMD4 encoding the two other IMPDH isoforms, which had not been found in the multicopy screens, would lead to increased MPA resistance. We found that IMD3 or IMD4 had no major effect on MPA resistance when overexpressed in a wild-type strain (Fig. 1D), although they conferred partial MPA resistance to the previously described dst1 (ppr2) MPA-hypersensitive mutant (3Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, overexpression of TPO1 did not affect resistance to 6AU, another inhibitor of IMPDH (3Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of IMD3 (and IMD4 orIMD2 to a lesser extent) led to increased resistance to 6AU (Fig. 1, D and E). Thus, although the Imd2p and Imd3p enzymes are 93% identical, they appear specifically to confer increased resistance to MPA and 6AU, respectively. These results explain why IMD3 and IMD4 were not found in the overexpression screen and are in good agreement with those of Reines and coworkers (8Shaw R.J. Wilson J.L. Smith K.T. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32905-32916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showing that the imd2 mutant strain is highly sensitive to MPA, whereas imd3 and imd4mutants are not. Our search for nonconserved residues between Imd2p and Imd3p/Imd4p that could account for this difference in MPA resistance did not reveal any residue previously described as critical for MPA sensitivity in other organisms (17Farazi T. Leichman J. Harris T. Cahoon M. Hedstrom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 961-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Digits J.A. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15388-15397Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, several Imd2p-specific residues were close to the MPA-binding site (1Sintchak M.D. Fleming M.A. Futer O. Raybuck S.A. Chambers S.P. Caron P.R. Murcko M.A. Wilson K.P. Cell. 1996; 85: 921-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and could therefore possibly affect the affinity of the enzyme for the inhibitor. To identify other yeast genes involved in MPA sensitivity, a collection of 4787 yeast haploid knock-out mutants, affecting about 75% of all yeast genes and 90% of yeast non-essential genes, were grown in 96-well plates and then transferred on SD casaWU medium supplemented with MPA (0, 30, and 100 mg/liter). Growth of the mutants was monitored after 3 days at 30 °C, and 165 mutants showing altered growth in the presence of MPA were analyzed further. The effect of MPA on these mutants was then assayed by a more acute growth test, i.e.drop test following serial dilution; 102 mutants were clearly more sensitive than the wild-type strain, whereas 2 mutants were more resistant (Table I). Apparent MPA sensitivity of several mutants in the initial screen was probably due to low cell concentration in the culture. Indeed, most of the false positive clones were mutants displaying severe growth defects even in the absence of the drug.Table IOpen reading frames (ORFs) in which deletion results in MPA hypo- or hypersensitivityORF1-aAn asterisk (*) indicates mutations that have been verified by complementation;

Open table in a new tab To verify that the MPA phenotype was indeed due to the knock-out mutation and not to an unlinked mutation, complementation of the MPA phenotype by the cognate wild-type gene carried on a plasmid was shown for 32 mutants (marked by an asterisk in Table I, data not shown). For all of the other mutants, we verified by PCR that the knock-out was indeed at the expected locus (data not shown). Although multiple aspects of yeast biology appear critical for growth in the presence of MPA, the most obvious functional group of mutants affected transcription. This group was not only the largest, but it also contained the most sensitive mutants. Four of these mutants,dst1, rtf1, rpb9, and paf1, had previously been shown to be sensitive to 6AU and MPA (3Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr.

Examples of growth phenotypes of such transcription mutants on MPA and 6AU are presented on Fig. 2. Among those mutants, met18 led to increased resistance to both drugs. Met18p (Mms19p) is involved in transcription and DNA repair through TFIIH activity, although this effect appears indirect (19Lauder S. Bankmann M. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6783-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reason for MPA resistance of the met18 mutant is not clear and could affect a yet uncharacterized function of this gene because none of the other mutants identified in this study are affected in DNA repair or TFIIH. Among the most sensitive mutants are spt3, spt7,spt8, and spt20 mutants affecting the SAGA complex (Fig. 3A). MPA sensitivity of these mutants was fully prevented by the addition of guanine, thus establishing that the drug affected the growth of these mutants strains through depletion of the guanylic nucleotide pools. This was further confirmed by showing that the spt mutants were also highly sensitive to 6AU (Fig. 3B). Growth of thespt3 mutant was impaired at MPA doses as low as 0.5 mg/liter and was totally abolished at 5 mg/liter (Fig. 3C). Strikingly, mutants affecting other components of the SAGA, such as Gcn5p or Ada1/2/3p proteins, were not detected as MPA-sensitive in the screen, although the cognate mutant strains were present in the knock-out collection. Further investigation revealed that indeedada2, ada3, and gcn5 were clearly not sensitive to the drug (Fig. 3D), whereas ada1 was sensitive but was not selected due to a severe growth defect even in the absence of MPA, as discussed in the previous paragraph (Fig.3D). This result indicates that only a subset of SAGA functions is affected by guanylic nucleotide limitation, thus confirming that SAGA subcomplex(es) could have separate functions (20Sterner D.E. Grant P.A. Roberts S.M. Duggan L.J. Belotserkovskaya R. Pacella L.A. Winston F. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell.

Knock-out of the RPB4and RPB9 genes, encoding non-essential subunits of RNA polymerase II (pol II), were clearly sensitive to MPA (Fig.3A) and reversed by guanine. It was previously shown that a point mutation in RPB2 encoding an essential subunit of pol II results in MPA sensitivity (4Powell W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6866-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and recently a similar phenotype was reported for the rpb9 mutant (6Van Mullem V. Wery M. Werner M. Vandenhaute J. Thuriaux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10220-10225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The drug effect was presumed to stress the transcriptional elongation machinery as the result of decreased nucleotide concentration. Indeed, the importance of nucleotide concentration on transcription elongation was recently demonstrated in E. coli, in which allosteric binding of NTPs to RNA polymerase was shown to regulate transcription elongation (23Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, rpb4 mutant appeared only slightly sensitive to 6AU, whereas rpb9 mutant was not strongly affected by this drug (Fig. 3B), in contradiction to previously published results (24Hemming S.A. Jansma D.B. Macgregor P.F. Goryachev A. Friesen J.D. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35506-35511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This discrepancy could be because of differences in strain background resulting in some indirect effect on uptake or potentiation of 6AU, thus limiting its effect on the guanine nucleotide pool. Finally, we found that a mutation in theRPA49 gene encoding a RNA pol I subunit is sensitive to both 6AU and MPA, thus showing that these drugs are not specific to RNA pol II. Two mutually nonexclusive mechanisms could lead to MPA sensitivity in the transcription mutants. MPA combined to the mutation could affect transcription of essential genes and result in a decreased growth rate, or alternatively, some mutants could specifically affect expression of genes required for drug resistance. BecauseTPO1 and IMD2 overexpression leads to MPA resistance, we suspected that transcription mutants could be sensitive to the drug as a consequence of reduced expression of these genes. This was tested by Northern blot analysis on RNA extracted from wild-type and mutant strains treated or not with MPA (5 mg/liter). Clearly, MPA treatment resulted in increased expression of IMD2 (8.1-fold induction) as reported previously (25Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 26Escobar-Henriques M. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1523-1530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas expression ofTPO1 was only slightly increased (2.3-fold) in the presence of the drug (Fig. 4A). ThePDA1 transcript, used as loading control, was not significantly affected by MPA treatment in the wild-type strain (Fig.4A). In three mutants, htz1, met18, and rpa49, neither TPO1 nor IMD2expression was strongly affected (Fig. 4, A andB), and their phenotype relative to MPA could therefore not be attributed to altered expression of IMD2 orTPO1. All of the other mutant strains showed lower expression of TPO1 or/and IMD2 transcript in the presence of MPA, i.e. at least two-fold lower than that of the wild-type strain (Fig 4, A and B). Mutantshpr1 and rtf1 were found specifically affected for IMD2 expression, whereas mutants snf2,snf6, and ctk1 were mostly affected forTPO1 expression. Finally, the remaining mutants,spt3, spt7, spt8, spt20,mot3, dal81, ctk3, paf1,rpb4, rpb9, and dst1, were affected for expression of both genes (Fig 4, A andB). Importantly, in most of the mutants, expression of TPO1and/or IMD2 transcript(s) was affected only in the presence of MPA (compare panels B and C in Fig. 4). We interpret this observation as follows: transcription of TPO1and/or IMD2 is not strongly affected in these mutant strains unless guanylic nucleotide pool is diminished (in the presence of MPA). This is precisely the predicted behavior of transcription elongation mutants (25Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Indeed, among these mutants are those (dst1,rtf1, rpb9, hpr1, paf1,ctk1) that were directly or indirectly related to transcription elongation (5Costa P.J. Arndt K.M. Genetics. 2000; 156: 535-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Van Mullem V. Wery M. Werner M. Vandenhaute J. Thuriaux P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1992; 12: 4142-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although this result suggests that several of these genes products could be involved in transcription elongation, we cannot rule out that some of these transcription factors could be required specifically for increased transcription initiation of TPO1 and/or IMD2 in cells with low GTP levels (in the presence of MPA). Surprisingly, the SAGA mutants spt3, spt8, andspt20 clearly affected IMD2 expression only in the presence of MPA, thus indicating a possible role for some SAGA subunits in transcription elongation. However, this observation could not be generalized to all SAGA mutants, Indeed, the spt7mutant showed very low expression of IMD2 andTPO1 both in the presence and absence of the drug (Fig. 4,A–C), whereas expression of these two genes was not significantly decreased in ada2, ada3, andgcn5 mutants (Fig. 4D). Therefore, our results reveal a good correlation between TPO1 and IMD2expression levels in the SAGA mutants and their respective sensitivity to MPA (Fig. 3D). We found that overexpression of TPO1 or IMD2partially or totally rescued MPA sensitivity of the transcription mutants, even those showing no defect in IMD2 andTPO1 expression (data not shown). We interpret this result as follows. Suppression of MPA toxicity by overexpression ofIMD2 or TPO1 is not strain-specific but rather reflects the fact that the products of these genes contribute to MPA detoxification. Indeed, Imd2p overexpression most probably detoxifies MPA by titrating the drug and Tpo1p by allowing its sequestration in the vacuole. Consequently, overexpression of these genes in any strain (mutant or wild-type) resulted in more efficient detoxification of the drug and increased resistance. Consistently, overexpression ofTPO1 and IMD2 also suppressed MPA sensitivity of nontranscriptional mutants such as vps15 andvps45 (data not shown). Several MPA-sensitive mutants (pep12,vph2, bem1, vrp1, ser1, andhom2) not directly related to transcriptional functions were clearly not affected for IMD2 or TPO1 expression (Fig 4E), thus confirming that MPA sensitivity can result from other cellular defects. Five mutants highly sensitive to MPA (erg3, erg4,erg5, erg6, and erg24; see Fig.5A) affect the late steps of ergosterol biosynthesis (steps 17, 19, 18, 15, and 13, respectively; reviewed in Ref. 29Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar). The erg3, erg4, anderg24 mutants are also sensitive to 6AU (Fig.5A), thus suggesting that they might not be sensitive to MPA but rather to any drug resulting in decreased GMP synthesis. Alternatively, these effects could be totally unspecific, because ergosterol biosynthesis defective mutants were previously shown to affect the resistance of yeast to several drugs including cycloheximide, camptothecin, nalidixic acid, fluconazole, and dactinomycin (see for example, Refs. 30Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 31Prendergast J.A Singer R.A. Rowley N. Rowley A. Johnston G.C. Danos M. Kennedy B.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These mutants, by modifying sterol composition, are thought to affect plasma membrane permeability and could therefore affect the uptake and/or efflux of the drug. Strikingly, erg4 and erg5 mutants are less sensitive to MPA and appear not to be affected by 6AU. Ten mutants involved in vacuolar function were slightly but reproducibly sensitive to MPA (Table I, Fig. 5C). Interestingly, six of these mutants affect the component of two protein complexes (pep3-pep5-vps33 and pep7-pep12-vps45) involved in transport from late Golgi to vacuole compartment (37Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2307-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 38Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These mutants are also highly sensitive to an aminoglycoside such as geneticin or hygromycin B although the reasons for this sensitivity are not yet clear (39Darsow T. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 40Yoshida S. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Why should these mutants be sensitive to MPA? One possibility could be that vacuolar function would be required for detoxification of MPA by TPO1 (see previous sections). Consistently, these vacuolar function mutants appear insensitive to 6AU (Fig. 5C), a drug that is not detoxified by overexpression of TPO1 (Fig. 1D). Three mutants, anp1, mnn10, and och1, that affect mannosyltransferase activity in the Golgi, were sensitive to MPA (Fig. 6A). Och1p is involved in the initiation of α-1,6-polymannose addition (34Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Nakayama K. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Anp1p and Mnn10p belong to a complex involved in the α-1,6 polymerizing activity (35Jungmann J. Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6579-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We propose that these mutations could result in increased sensitivity to MPA as a consequence of under-glycosylation, which could affect cell wall integrity and enhance MPA uptake. Indeed, all three mutants are hypersensitive to other drugs such as hygromycin B (35Jungmann J. Rayner J.C. Munro S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6579-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36Lee B.N. Elion E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12679-12684Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that addition of a subtoxic dose of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which is highly toxic for the och1 mutant cells (36, Fig. 6B), made wild-type cells hypersensitive to MPA (Fig. 6B). This “synthetic” toxicity at very low doses of MPA and SDS in wild-type cells highlights the fact that MPA uptake is most probably notably limiting for its toxic effect. Strikingly, two mutants affecting serine biosynthesis (ser1,ser2) and three affecting threonine biosynthesis (hom2, hom6, thr1) were sensitive to MPA. In both cases, MPA sensitivity could be relieved by the specific addition of an excess of serine or threonine, respectively (Fig.7). These results suggest that serine and threonine uptake is impaired in the presence of MPA. Uptake of these amino acids appears clearly limiting for growth, because the addition of serine, competing with threonine for uptake, impairs the growth ofthr1 and hom2 mutants, whereas conversely, the addition of threonine affects the growth of the ser1 mutant (Fig. 7). Consistently, two mutants affecting amino acid permeases,tat1 and bap2, are also highly sensitive to MPA, suggesting that amino acid uptake is exquisitely sensitive to a decrease in guanylic nucleotide synthesis. Finally, knock-out of several open reading frames of unknown function resulted in MPA sensitivity (Fig. 5D). YDL100cencodes a putative protein similar to an efflux pump from E. coli and could be involved directly in MPA detoxification.YDR049w encodes a zinc finger-containing protein expressed under stress conditions (heat shock, stationary phase, etc.) and could therefore be a general stress response protein. Consistently, theydr049 mutant is hypersensitive to rapamycin and cycloheximide (41Chan T.F. Carvalho J. Riles L. Zheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13227-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). MPA sensitivity of mutants in such genes of unknown function provides a first clue to their function. From this study, it clearly appears that all MPA-sensitive mutants are not specifically affected in transcription elongation, although most transcription mutants identified behaved like the previously described elongation mutants. In such a global approach, an important issue is to determine the specificity of the mutants toward the drug of interest. Indeed, mutants affecting stress response or general drug detoxification processes are expected to lead to “unspecific” sensitivity to several drugs. Such mutants, although not very informative on the cellular effects of the drug, are helpful to understand how cells manage to detoxify the drug. To evaluate the specificity of the mutants identified in our screen, we compared our results to those obtained in a similar screen carried out on a partial knock-out library (2216 yeast strains) with the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin (41Chan T.F. Carvalho J. Riles L. Zheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13227-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mutations in 11 genes involved in transcription were found to affect rapamycin sensitivity; two of those mutants (rpb4 and spt8) were also found in our screen, although these mutants are hypersensitive to MPA (this work) and hyposensitive to rapamycin (41Chan T.F. Carvalho J. Riles L. Zheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13227-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, MPA sensitivity of transcription mutants found in our screen does not result from a defect in a general cellular drug response. Furthermore, 6AU sensitivity of most MPA-sensitive mutants affecting transcription strongly argues for a specific dysfunction because of altered guanylic nucleotides synthesis. Nonetheless, several MPA-sensitive mutants identified in this screen were also sensitive to rapamycin. These mutants affect various processes such as protein synthesis (rps27B), cell cycle and cytoskeleton (sic1,cik1, bem1, cdc10), and metabolic pathways (hom2, ser1, ser2). The sensitivity of these mutants to both drugs could reflect their involvement either in functions particularly vulnerable to drug disturbance or in pathways required for multiple drug resistance. This genome-wide study revealed several cellular functions that are critical for natural resistance to MPA. Importantly, we found that most of the mutants affecting a specific function showed a similar sensitivity level. Indeed, we found for example that most of the highly sensitive mutants were transcription mutants, whereas all of the vacuolar mutants behaved similarly, being only slightly sensitive to the drug. The identification of MPA-sensitive cellular functions should help to develop strategies to potentiate the effect of the drug and to limit its natural detoxification. We thank Drs. A. Aguilera, T.

This degradation pathway shares its ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Rad6, with the post-replication/translesion DNA repair pathway. Because DNA repair is thought to play an essential role in HIV-1 integration, we investigated whether other molecules of this DNA repair pathway could interact with integrase. We observed that co-expression of human Rad18 induced the accumulation of an otherwise unstable form of HIV-1 integrase. This accumulation occurred even though hRAD18 possesses a RING finger domain, a structure that is generally associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase function and protein degradation. Evidence for an interaction between integrase and hRad18 was obtained through reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation. Moreover we found that a 162-residue region of hRad18 (amino acids 65–226) was sufficient for both integrase stabilization and interaction. Finally, we observed that HIV-1 integrase co-localized with hRad18 in nuclear structures in a subpopulation of co-transfected cells.

In order to mediate these very diverse processes, integrase is believed to associate with a number of cellular factors and to exploit their functions. One such instance is the filling of the gaps left after the ligation of 3′-ends of the viral DNA to the 5′-ends of the staggered cleavage in cellular DNA. The factors involved are thought to be proteins specialized in the maintenance of the genome integrity. It has recently been reported that a particular DNA repair mechanism, the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, has a major impact on integration frequency (7Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and that some of its components interact with the pre-integration complex (8Li L. Olvera J.M. Yoder K.E.

Regardless, failure to accomplish either of these processes results in apoptosis, which is observed in NHEJ-deficient cells upon infection with HIV-1 (7Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M.

Components of another DNA repair pathway, the base excision repair (BER), have been successfully tested in vitro for their ability to repair retroviral integration-dependent gaps (11Yoder K.E.

Its proposed role in chromatin decondensation would facilitate access of the repair machinery to the integration site (13Ha H.C. Juluri K. Zhou Y. Leung S. Hermankova M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3364-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).We recently reported that integrase is a substrate for the N-end rule (14Mulder L.C. Muesing M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29749-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) a distinct ubiquitin-proteasome pathway that defines the half-life of target proteins according to their N-terminal residue (15Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Authentic HIV-1 integrase is the proteolytic product of the Gag-Pol polyprotein and specifies an N-terminal phenylalanine, which renders it particularly prone to N-end rule degradation, and therefore makes it very unstable. In general, degradation of proteins by the proteasome proceeds after the substrate has been covalently modified by linkage of a ubiquitin chain. This type of protein tagging is sequentially performed by enzymes or clusters of enzymes broadly named E1, E2, and E3 (16Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). In yeast, where the N-end rule was first described (17Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar), the E2 molecule is Rad6 (18Sung P. Berleth E. Pickart C. Prakash S. Prakash L.

Rad6 is involved in a number of apparently diverse processes, such as sporulation, retrotransposition, N-end rule protein degradation, and DNA repair (19Broomfield S. Hryciw T. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Rad6 is able to bind directly to the E3 molecule of the N-end rule, Ubr-1 (20Madura K. Dohmen R.J. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12046-12054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and also associates with Rad18 when involved in DNA repair (21Bailly V. Lamb J. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The DNA repair pathway in which Rad6 and Rad18 participate is known as DNA post-replication (PRR)/translesion repair (19Broomfield S. Hryciw T. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 22Lawrence C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). One of the primary roles of the PRR/translesion pathway is to overcome structural restraints such as DNA adducts or UV-induced thymine-dimers that prevent the chromosomal DNA replication from being completed (19Broomfield S. Hryciw T. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of action of the Rad6-Rad18 complex has not yet been elucidated. However, it is widely assumed that the Rad6-Rad18 heterodimer converges to the site of blocked DNA synthesis by means of the single strand DNA binding ability of Rad18 (23Bailly V. Lauder S. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23360-23365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 24Bailly V. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4536-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the stalled replicative machinery is removed, possibly by Rad6-dependent ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation, and is replaced by protein complexes that include molecules such as Mms2-Ubc13 and Rad5 or repair polymerases such as Polη or Polζ (19Broomfield S. Hryciw T. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).The putative involvement of Rad6 in the degradation of integrase and the similarity between the repair of the retroviral gaps with the proposed post-replication/translesion DNA repair model prompted us to investigate whether PRR/translesion molecules are implicated in integrase function. We demonstrate here that hRad18 interacts with HIV-1 integrase and that it protects integrase from an accelerated degradation. Moreover, hRad18 causes a re-localization of integrase in a subset of transfected cells so that both proteins co-localize in the same sub-nuclear structures.RESULTSAn in silico amino acid sequence analysis (28Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2983) Google Scholar) revealed that hRad18 contains a specific type of zinc finger motif known as RING finger. This domain has been proposed to be a distinguishing feature of molecules with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (29Kamura T. Koepp D.M. Conrad M.N. Skowyra D. Moreland R.J. Iliopoulos O. Lane W.S.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The RING finger domain is also required for the degradative activity of Ubr1, the N-end rule E3 ligase in yeast (33Xie Y. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6832-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).Unexpectedly, Western blot analysis showed that three different forms of integrase, two inherently unstable (Phe-IN and Arg-IN) (14Mulder L.C. Muesing M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29749-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as well as a stable form (Met-IN) significantly accumulated in the presence of co-transfected hRad18 (Fig.1B). This indicated that hRad18 did not increase degradation of integrase. Rather, this experiment showed that hRad18-mediated stabilization of integrase was largely independent from the N-end rule, since all three forms of integrase were similarly affected. No variation in the amounts of EGFP were detected in the presence or absence of hRad18 (data not shown) ruling out a transcriptional effect on the integrase expression vectors as the cause of the accumulation.To determine whether the hRad18-induced accumulation of integrase might depend on an interaction between the two molecules, an unstable form of integrase (Phe-IN) was transfected into HEK 293T cells together with FLAG-hRad18 or with an empty vector as control. Following lysis and sonication protein complexes were precipitated either with an anti-integrase or with an anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by reciprocal immunoblotting. Integrase could be precipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and hRad18 with an anti-integrase antibody (Fig.2), which demonstrated an interaction between the two proteins.Figure 2Co-immunoprecipitation (I.P.) of human Rad18 and HIV-1 integrase. The plasmid encoding FLAG-hRad18 was transfected either with authentic integrase (Phe-IN) or with an empty vector (pEGFP*IRES-ATG); “−.” Cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG or anti-integrase antibodies. The lysates were precipitated and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Blots with anti-FLAG precipitates were probed with anti-integrase mAb12, and conversely, blots with anti-integrase precipitates were probed with anti-FLAG mAb M2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Human Rad18 has been localized to the nucleus (34Tateishi S. Sakuraba Y. Masuyama S. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which is compatible with its DNA repair function. Indeed, when hRad18 was transfected in HEK 293T cells it was strictly confined to the nuclear compartment (Fig. 3A). However, hRad18 distribution was not always homogeneous, and we consistently observed that it displayed a structured nuclear pattern in a subpopulation of cells. These different distributions conceivably depend on the different physiologic states of the cells.Figure 3Intracellular distribution of hRad18 and its co-localization with HIV-1 integrase. A, cells transfected with FLAG-hRad18 were fixed and permeabilized. FLAG-hRad18 was detected with anti-FLAG mAb M2 and goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 594 (red). DNA was stained with Hoechst 33258 (blue). B, cells transfected with FLAG-hRad18 and Met-IN were first permeabilized and then fixed. Integrase was detected with anti-integrase mAb 6G5 and goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 647 (red), whereas hRad18 was detected with anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody and goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (green). DNA was stained with Hoechst 33258 (blue).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When expressed alone, integrase usually exhibited a fine punctate nuclear pattern in 293T cells. However, further immunofluorescence experiments revealed that in a subset of cells co-transfected with hRad18, integrase re-localized within the nucleus to larger structures that coincided with the distribution of hRad18 (Fig. 3B). The permeabilization step used before fixation allowed us to visualize only the complexes that were detergent-resistant and thus more likely to have a relevant role in vivo.To determine which region of hRad18 was responsible for stabilization of integrase, we performed a deletion mutagenesis analysis. Human Rad18 has at least three putative functional domains, a RING finger, a zinc finger, and a SAP domain (Fig.4A). We constructed a total of eight deletion mutants (Fig. 4B), each of them harboring an N-terminal FLAG tag for antibody recognition. Experiments were carried out by co-transfecting each of the deletion mutants of hRad18 with the physiologic, unstable form of integrase (Phe-IN). Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for stabilization of integrase and by co-immunoprecipitation to detect binding. All of the hRad18 mutants, except for mutant 1-76, were expressed at levels comparable to that of wild-type hRad18 (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Fig.4B shows that a number of the mutants were able to stabilize integrase to various degrees (upper panel), but that only one of these mutants (65-226) exhibited a detectable level of binding after our immunoprecipitation protocol (middle panel). The portion of hRad18 encoded by this mutant encompasses the region C-terminal of the RING finger and the putative zinc finger. Interestingly, longer exposure times revealed a minor accumulation of integrase also in two mutants lacking the zinc finger motif, namely 239-495 and to a lesser degree 285-495 (data not shown). This stabilization, though less in magnitude, could be evidence for a second region of interaction with integrase positioned in the C terminus of hRad18. This observation could in part explain why the interaction between integrase and mutant 65-226 is not as effective as with full-length hRad18.Weaker interactions due to steric interference with improperly folded domains could be the reason why integrase did not co-precipitate with mutants encoding fragments larger than 65–226. Taken together these results show that a relatively small region within hRad18 encompassing amino acids 65–226 is sufficient for both accumulation of and binding to integrase.DISCUSSIONRepair of host chromosomal DNA at the insertion site is pivotal for productive retroviral integration. In this work we tested the hypothesis that components of the DNA postreplication/translesion repair pathway could play a role in HIV-1 integrase biology. We describe the interaction between HIV-1 integrase and hRad 18, whoseSaccharomyces cerevisae homologue is an essential member of the PRR/translesion pathway. This interaction results in an increased stabilization of integrase, which in its natural form is a particularly unstable protein (14Mulder L.C. Muesing M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29749-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition to the accumulation of integrase, we observed through reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation an association of hRad18 with integrase. These results suggest that the stability of integrase is tightly regulated by its interaction with hRad18.A parallel can be drawn between the possible role of hRad18 in HIV-1 integration and that of the protein MuB in the transposition of bacteriophage Mu. Indeed, Mu transposition is a prototype model for retroviral integration. The Mu bacteriophage requires multiple transpositions into the bacterial chromosome to replicate. This complex reaction is orchestrated by its transposase, MuA, in concert with both host and viral factors. After recombination is completed, the nucleoprotein complex (transpososome) is remodeled by the bacterial chaperone molecule ClpX (35Levchenko I. Luo L. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 36Kruklitis R. Welty D.J. Nakai H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that specifically recognizes MuA and mediates its unfolding and eventually its destabilization (37Burton B.M. Williams T.L. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 449-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The susceptibility of HIV-1 integrase to rapid degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway N-end rule (14Mulder L.C. Muesing M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29749-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and a recent report indicating that in vitro an excess of integrase inhibits closure of the DNA single strand intervals (11Yoder K.E. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11191-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) seems to suggest that indeed the integration complex (intasome) needs to be disassembled for integration to be completed. The phage protein MuB has been found to exert part of its function before the destabilization of the transpososome. MuB has been reported to stabilize the transposition complex by binding the transposase MuA in a region that overlaps with the binding site recognized by ClpX for disassembly and remodeling (38Levchenko I. Yamauchi M. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that MuB has a modulatory activity, allowing the remodeling of the transpososome to proceed exclusively during the transition to the replicative stage (38Levchenko I. Yamauchi M. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1561-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). By analogy we propose that hRad18 may regulate the stability of integrase to guarantee a productive insertion of the viral genome into the host DNA.A ubiquitin ligase function of hRad18 favoring the degradation of integrase cannot be excluded, and one could interpret the stabilization effect as a titration of the endogenous factors necessary for an efficient proteolytic degradation due to over-expression of hRad18 itself. However, the possibility that hRad18 titrates the human homologues of Rad6 is unlikely since it has been reported that the RING finger of hRad18 is necessary for hRad6A/B-hRad18 binding (34Tateishi S. Sakuraba Y. Masuyama S. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our deletion analysis showed that the RING finger motif does not play an essential role in the interaction between hRad18 and HIV-1 integrase, ruling out a direct competition between HIV-1 integrase and hRad6A/B for hRad18 binding. Indeed, the 162-amino acid peptide that encompasses a putative zinc finger seems to be sufficient to both stabilize and associate with integrase.The re-localization of integrase and its co-localization with hRad18 in a subset of cells suggests an additional function for this association. Human Rad18 contains a putative SAP-box (39Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), a domain recently recognized to mediate the binding of certain proteins to specific A/T-rich DNA regions known as the scaffold attachment regions (SAR) (40Kipp M.

Interestingly, PARP-1, Ku antigens, and HMG-I/Y, which are involved in retroviral integration (7Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M.

Cell. 1997; 88: 483-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), have all been found to be SAR-binding proteins (42Galande S. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20521-20528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 43Zhao K. Kas E. Gonzalez E.

An intriguing possibility is that the molecules relevant for HIV-1 integration cluster together, perhaps in the vicinity of SARs, achieving in this way the coordination required for these complex reactions.A role for the molecules of the PRR/translesion pathway in retroviral integration does not rule out other DNA repair mechanisms such as NHEJ or BER (7Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11Yoder K.E. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11191-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Examples for an overlap between DNA repair pathways that can function on the same damaged site have been recently reported in yeast. For instance, the activity of the Srs2 helicase is the main switch for the interaction between RAD6-RAD18 and the RAD52 epistasis (19Broomfield S. Hryciw T. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that different DNA repair pathways complement each other to complete the sequence of events that leads to a productive HIV-1 integration. Integrase (IN)1 is essential for the completion of the retroviral life cycle. This viral protein performs different tasks that include cooperation in reverse transcription (1Wu X. Liu H. Xiao H. Conway J.A. Hehl E. Kalpana G.V. Prasad V. Kappes J.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2126-2135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nuclear import of the pre-integration complex 2D. R. Kaufman and M. A.

Virol. 1996; 70: 6820-6825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and integration of the viral DNA into the host genome (5LaFemina R.L. Schneider C.L. Robbins H.L. Callahan P.L. LeGrow K. Roth E.

In order to mediate these very diverse processes, integrase is believed to associate with a number of cellular factors and to exploit their functions. One such instance is the filling of the gaps left after the ligation of 3′-ends of the viral DNA to the 5′-ends of the staggered cleavage in cellular DNA. The factors involved are thought to be proteins specialized in the maintenance of the genome integrity. It has recently been reported that a particular DNA repair mechanism, the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, has a major impact on integration frequency (7Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and that some of its components interact with the pre-integration complex (8Li L. Olvera J.M. Yoder K.E. Mitchell R.S. Butler S.L. Lieber M. Martin S.L. Bushman F.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3272-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). NHEJ is thought to act on the repair of the gaps (7Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9Daniel R. Katz R.A. Merkel G. Hittle J.C. Yen T.J. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell.

Virol. 2001; 75: 3121-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), although other evidence suggests that it plays a role in the formation of non-integrated HIV-1 DNA circles (8Li L. Olvera J.M.

Regardless, failure to accomplish either of these processes results in apoptosis, which is observed in NHEJ-deficient cells upon infection with HIV-1 (7Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 8Li L. Olvera J.M. Yoder K.E. Mitchell R.S. Butler S.L. Lieber M. Martin S.L. Bushman F.D.

Components of another DNA repair pathway, the base excision repair (BER), have been successfully tested in vitro for their ability to repair retroviral integration-dependent gaps (11Yoder K.E. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11191-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), an enzyme activated by DNA strand breaks, has also been linked to the retroviral integration process (12Gaken J.A."

Nature. 1964; 201: 1284-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) will be used throughout; see Fig. 1), initially synthesized as preproenzymes. These are proteolytically processed to render proenzymes by removal of the signal peptide, followed by activation to the mature forms. This proceeds equally by limited proteolysis, normally targeted to an arginine/lysine-valine/isoleucine peptide bond, in the manner characteristic for serine proteases (19Neurath H. Reich E. Rifkins D.B. Shaw E. Proteases and Biological Control. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1975: 51-64Google Scholar). Kallikreins display mostly trypsin-like specificity, thus hydrolyzing peptide bonds preferentially after lysine and arginine residues of oligopeptide substrates (20Clements J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 99: C1-C6Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Unlike trypsin, however, they do not display significant activity toward larger proteins. This specificity makes them candidate autoactivators or activating enzymes for other prokallikreins, putatively in cascade reactions similar to those described for blood coagulation, digestion, fibrinolysis, and apoptosis. In humans, tissue kallikrein gene family members consist of five coding exons and map in tandem to the same chromosomal locus (19q13.3–13.4) (5Yousef G.M. Diamandis E.P. Endocr.

Like the other members of the human kallikrein family, the KLK6 gene lies at chromosome locus 19q13.4, telomeric to the PSA (KLK3) and KLK2 genes (5Yousef G.M. Diamandis E.P. Endocr.

Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1345-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical localization of hK6 in various tissues, showing epithelial cell secretion, has been published (35Petraki C.D. Karavana V.N. Skoufogiannis P.T. Little S.P. Howarth D.J. Yousef G.M. Diamandis E.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It has also been detected in pathological tissues, as human colon adenocarcinoma and ovarian and breast cancer. In the metastatic breast tumor cell line BT474, estrogens and progestins up-regulate the expression of hK6 in a dose-dependent manner (36Yousef G.M. Luo L.Y. Scherer S.W. Sotiropoulou G. Diamandis E.P. Genomics. 1999; 62: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The connection between breast and prostate cancer and steroid hormones has been established in many epidemiological studies (37López-Otı́n C. Diamandis E.P. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 365-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). hK6 was shown to be down-regulated in the metastatic cells but strongly expressed, although less so than in normal tissues, in primary breast cancer cells, ovarian cancer tissue, and tumor cell lines, whereas no expression was detected in normal ovary (16Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Stenman G. Mok S.C. Sager R. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 624-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasminogen was suggested as a putative target in the search for physiological substrates of hK6. Proteolytic cleavage of plasminogen in vitro resulted in the generation of angiostatin and angiostatin-like fragments. Angiostatin is an endogenous inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and metastatic growth. Therefore, this expression pattern suggests that hK6 contributes to several cancers in establishing breast and ovarian primary tumors and that it may function later during tumor progression as a potential metastasis and angiogenesis inhibitor (16Anisowicz A. Sotiropoulou G. Stenman G. Mok S.C. Sager R. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 624-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tanimoto H. Underwood L.J. Shigemasa K. Parmley T.H. O'Brien T.J. Tumour Biol. 2001; 22: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The protein has also been found in adult but not in fetal brain. It is decreased in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease patients (33Ogawa K. Yamada T. Tsujioka Y. Taguchi J. Takahashi M. Tsuboi Y. Fujino Y. Nakajima M. Yamamoto T. Akatsu H. Mitsui S. Yamaguchi N. Psych. Clin. Neurosci. 2000; 54: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with the enzyme and amyloid precursor protein accumulate amyloidogenic fragments (28Little S.P. Dixon E.P. Norris F. Buckley W. Becker G.W. Johnson M. Dobbins J.R. Wyrick T. Miller J.R. MacKellar W. Hepburn D. Corvalan J. McClure D. Liu X. Stephenson D. Clemens J. Johnstone E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25135-25142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Accordingly, hK6 has been implicated in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. This activity of hK6 in brain is consistent with the finding that its mRNA is induced in the perilesioned region upon injury of the central nervous system (39Tomizawa K., He, X. Yamanaka H. Shiosaka S. Yoshida S. Brain Res. 1999; 824: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results and the fact that hK6 has been found in significantly increased concentrations in the serum of ovarian cancer patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and blood of Alzheimer's disease patients have led to the development of an immunofluorometric assay for the measurement of this new biomarker for breast and ovarian cancer and for Alzheimer's disease (40Diamandis E.P. Yousef G.M. Soosaipillai A.R. Bunting P. Clin. Biochem. 2000; 33: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 41Diamandis E.P. Yousef G.M. Petraki C. Soosaipillai A.R.

Biochem. 2000; 33: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). hK6 is a serine proteinase expressed as an inactive zymogen to prevent proteolytic activity in the wrong environment. Upon adequate stimulation, limited proteolysis is induced, leading to proenzyme activation. For the first time, we have analyzed the proform of a member of the (human) kallikrein family by x-ray crystallography, since no three-dimensional structure of a prokallikrein was available. We present the essential features of the structural determinants for activation of human pro-hK6, which can be extrapolated to the other 14 members of the family. Initial trials to produce homogenous protein including the residues of the chemical sequence of the hK6 precursor Ala10–Lys245 (chymotrypsin numbering (18Hartley B.S. Nature. 1964; 201: 1284-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); corresponds to Ala16–Lys244 of the sequential protein numbering (see Fig. 1)) failed due to autolysis after Arg76. 2T. Tsetsenis, unpublished results. Accordingly, this residue was mutated to glutamine. TheN-glycosylation site at Asn132 prevented the protein from crystallizing, so it was also replaced by glutamine. Finally, a further mutation occurred in the activation peptide region during PCR cloning (Q13R). This construct, harboring three mutations, was used to express the recombinant proteins used in the present study. The protein was heterologously overexpressed in yeast following an approach recently reported for other proproteases (43Ventura S. Villegas V. Sterner J. Larson J. Vendrell J. Hershberger C.L. Avilés F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 28: 19925-19933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, the vector pPIC9 containing the mutant gene was transformed into Pichia pastoris strain KM71 by the spheroblast method. After expression at 30 °C, the culture supernatant containing pro-hK6 was separated by centrifugation and subjected to two steps of purification (hydrophobic and anion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography). A final size exclusion chromatography step resulted in highly purified protein, finally concentrated to 10 mg/ml (in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mm benzamidine). The presence of a single continuous protein chain was assessed by mass spectrometry and automated Edman degradation analysis of the N-terminal sequence. Pro-hK6 was activated to render fully active mature hK6 by trypsin and lysyl endopeptidase cleavage; the active enzyme was tested for activity against the synthetic substrateN α-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester (Sigma). This shows that our pro-hK6 form is not a nonactivable truncated species, as described in the form of subunit III for the serine protease proenzyme proprotease E (44Gomis-Rüth F.X. Gómez-Ortiz M. Vendrell J. Ventura S. Bode W. Huber R. Avilés F.X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The protein was crystallized using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method from equivolumetric drops of protein and precipitant solution (30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.2m MgCl2). Well shaped orthorhombic crystals belonging to space group P212121(a = 46.0 Å, b = 66.4 Å,c = 71.2 Å) were obtained. These crystals diffract to better than 1.8-Å resolution and harbor one monomer in the asymmetric unit and 43% solvent (Vm = 2.2 Å3/Da (45Matthews B.W. J. Mol.

Crystals briefly soaked in this solution were immediately flash cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored for diffraction analysis. Diffraction data collection was performed at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamlines (Grenoble, France) with 165-mm marCCD and ADSC Quantum4 CCD detectors. Data were processed with MOSFLM version 6.11b (46Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Accordingly, these coordinates were used as a searching model to solve the structure by molecular replacement, using the stand alone version of AMoRe (48Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The rotation function (RF) showed a clear peak at Eulerian angles α = 26.7°, β = 87.5°, and γ = 74.0°. The correlation coefficient in amplitudes (CC (48Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The translation function also rendered a clear solution (26.7, 87.5, 74.0, 0.3396, 0.0569, 0.2789; α, β, γ in degrees, and x,y, z in fractional cell coordinates; CC = 17.1%; Rfactor = 53.8%; second highest peak CC = 11.2%, Rfactor = 56.2%). A final rigid body refinement with FITING (48Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The input coordinates were rotated and translated according to this solution and subjected to a simulated annealing refinement step and positional/temperature factor refinement using maximum likelihood as a criterion after performing bulk solvent correction and anisotropic temperature factor refinement (Rfactor = 41.3%; freeRfactor = 44.2%).

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) was used for this purpose. The subsequently computed ςA-weighted 2mFo − DFc and mFo − DFc electron density maps, inspected together with the initially refined model on a SGI Graphic Work station with the program TURBO-FRODO (50Roussel A. Cambilleau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-79Google Scholar), showed the correctness of the solution and positive difference density for the regions diverging from the phasing model. At this stage, an electron density/model improvement step was undertaken with ARP/wARP (51Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

This calculation rendered excellent electron density maps (see Fig. 2,a and b) and a model consisting of five chains and 185 residues identified within the sequence. In successive cycles, this model was improved by alternating manual model building and crystallographic refinement with CNS and refmac5 (52Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) under translations and liberations of pseudo-rigid bodies (TLS) refinement (53Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). In the final stages, solvent molecules were introduced where appropriate, if present in 2mFo − DFc and mFo − DFc maps contoured at 1 and 2.5 ς, respectively. The final model comprises the residues ranging from Lys15to Ala244 of the chemical sequence of pro-hK6 and 158 solvent molecules (labeled W 501 to W 658). As observed in other serine proteinase zymogens, chain segments corresponding to parts of the calcium-binding loop (in particular, Ser78–Gln80), autolysis loop (Asp148–Phe151), and base-forming segment (Tyr188–Ser190) are flexible. Together with the first 3 residues (Lys15–Val17), they have been tentatively traced based on very weak electron density and set to zero occupancy. All active residues lie within the allowed regions of a Ramachandran plot as determined with PROCHECK (54Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Thornton J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The peptide bond Ile218-Pro219 is in thecis-conformation. Table I provides a summary of the final refinement statistics.

To localize binding sites of SERCA2a for PLB, we performed Cys-scanning mutagenesis of PLB, co-expressed the PLB mutants with SERCA2a in insect cell microsomes, and tested for cross-linking of the mutated PLB molecules to SERCA2a using 1,6-bismaleimidohexane, a 10-Å-long, homobifunctional thiol cross-linking agent. Of several mutants tested, only PLB with a Cys replacement at position 30 (N30C-PLB) cross-linked to SERCA2a. Cross-linking occurred specifically and with high efficiency. The process was abolished by micromolar Ca2+ or by an anti-PLB monoclonal antibody and was inhibited 50% by phosphorylation of PLB by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The SERCA2a inhibitors thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid also completely prevented cross-linking. The two essential requirements for cross-linking of N30C-PLB to SERCA2a were a Ca2+-free enzyme and, unexpectedly, a micromolar concentration of ATP or ADP, demonstrating that N30C-PLB cross-links preferentially to the nucleotide-bound, E2 state of SERCA2a. Sequencing of a purified proteolytic fragment in combination with SERCA2a mutagenesis identified Cys318 of SERCA2a as the sole amino acid cross-linked to N30C-PLB. The proximity of residue 30 of PLB to Cys318 of SERCA2a suggests that PLB may interfere with Ca2+ activation of SERCA2a by a protein interaction occurring near transmembrane helix M4.

In heart, the predominant Ca2+-ATPase expressed is SERCA2a (1MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), which pumps Ca2+ into the SR lumen, causing cardiac muscle relaxation (2Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3207) Google Scholar). A unique property of cardiac muscle is the regulation of SERCA2a by PLB, a small, single span membrane protein (3Simmerman H.K.B. Collins J.H. Theibert J.L. Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PLB at Ser16 by PKA and at Thr17 by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase relieves the inhibitory action of PLB on SERCA2a, giving an increase in the rate of cardiac muscle relaxation as well as a positive inotropic effect (6Simmerman H.K.B.

Drugs Ther. 2001; 15: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Currently, there is much interest in understanding the molecular mechanism of SERCA2a inhibition by PLB, both as a paradigm for understanding membrane protein interactions and for the potential of targeting drugs to this system to treat heart failure (6Simmerman H.K.B.

Rev. 1997; 78: 921-947Crossref Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Containing only 52 amino acids, the protein is a homopentamer in the membrane held together by Leu/Ile zipper interactions occurring in the transmembrane region (residues 32–52) (8Simmerman H.K.B. Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain (residues 1–31) is highly charged and basic and is postulated to interact with SERCA2a by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (9James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 10Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLB mutagenesis studies suggest that the PLB monomer is the active inhibitory species, which dissociates from the pentamer, binds to SERCA2a, and inhibits the Ca2+-ATPase by direct protein interactions (11Kimura Y.

Considerable attention has been given to delineating the three-dimensional structural interactions between PLB and SERCA2a, especially in light of the recent crystal structure determination of SERCA1a (the skeletal muscle isoform) to 2.6-Å resolution (17Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). An indirect approach for studying protein structure is to use mutagenesis and, by producing loss of function or gain of function PLB mutants, infer sites in both the cytoplasmic (10Toyofuku T.

Another approach is to use chemical cross-linking to directly identify physical contact points. In an earlier reconstitution study by James et al. (9James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), Lys3 of PLB was shown to photoaffinity-label to residues 397–400 of SERCA2a. A functional requirement for these SERCA2a residues in transducing PLB inhibition was subsequently demonstrated by Toyofuku et al. (19Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22929-22932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using replacement mutagenesis. However, this strategy of purification and reconstitution followed by photoaffinity labeling (9James P. Inui M. Tada M. Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Nature. 1989; 342: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) is difficult to execute with PLB and SERCA2a and has not been duplicated in other laboratories. More recent approaches to address physical interactions between PLB and SERCA2a are cryoelectron microscopy of PLB/SERCA2a co-crystals (20Young H.S. Jones L.R. Stokes D.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 884-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and assessment of fusion protein interactions (21Kimura Y. Inui M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here we describe direct chemical cross-linking of PLB to SERCA2a in microsomes in situ with no reconstitution required. A Cys-substituted mutant of PLB (N30C-PLB) and native SERCA2a were co-expressed in Sf21 insect cell microsomes (13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Cornea R.L. Autry J.M. Chen Z. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and cross-linking of the two molecules was achieved with the homobifunctional thiol probe, BMH (22Green N.S. Reisler E. Houk K.N. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1293-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). N30C-PLB is shown to label SERCA2a specifically and with high efficiency. Coupling occurs at only one of the 26 (13) endogenous Cys residues of SERCA2a, Cys318. Characterization of factors modulating the cross-linking signal gives several new insights into the mechanism of Ca2+ pump inhibition by PLB. BMH was obtained from Pierce. Thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid were purchased from Sigma. Mouse recombinant PKA was from Calbiochem, and endo-Asp-N and endo-Lys-C were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Point mutations were introduced into the cDNA encoding the canine isoform of PLB, using the Altered Sites II Mutagenesis SystemTM (13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Cornea R.L. Autry J.M. Chen Z. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All single Cys replacements in PLB described presently were made on the Cys-less PLB background, which is canine PLB with Cys residues 36, 41, and 46 changed to Ala. The Cys-less PLB mutant retains full functional activity (23Autry J.M. Kobayashi Y. Jones L.R. Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (abstr.): 337Google Scholar, 24Karim C.B. Paterlini M.G. Reddy L.G. Hunter G.W.

Mutated PLB inserts were subcloned into the BglII site of the pVL1393 transfection vector and co-transfected into Sf21 insect cells using BaculoGoldTM (Pharmingen) linearized baculovirus DNA. Baculoviruses were plaque-purified and amplified as described (13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Cornea R.L. Autry J.M. Chen Z. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Wild-type canine SERCA2a cDNA (13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was mutated directly in the transfection vector pVL1393 using the QuikChangeTM XL-Gold system (Stratagene). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Canine SERCA2a and PLB were co-expressed in Sf21 insect cells as described (13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Cornea R.L. Autry J.M. Chen Z. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Most co-expressions were with wild-type SERCA2a and N30C-PLB (on the Cys-less PLB background). Microsomes were harvested 60 h after initiating baculovirus infections and stored frozen in small aliquots at −40 °C at a protein concentration of 6–10 mg/ml (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking between N30C-PLB and SERCA2a remained intact after several freeze-thaw cycles of microsomal membranes. Sulfhydryl cross-linking was performed at room temperature using the homobifunctional cross-linking agent BMH (Pierce). The reactions were conducted with 11 μg of microsomal protein in 12 μl of buffer A, consisting of 40 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 3.2 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm ATP, and 1 mm EGTA. Incubations were routinely conducted for 1 h in the presence of 0.1 mmBMH. Reactions were started by adding 0.75 μl of BMH from a 1.6 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide and stopped by adding 7.5 μl of SDS-PAGE sample-loading buffer (13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) containing 15% SDS plus 100 mm dithiothreitol. After terminating the reactions, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To assess Ca2+ effects on cross-linking, ionized Ca2+ was varied by adding CaCl2 to buffer A (13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Cornea R.L. Autry J.M. Chen Z. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When PKA effects on cross-linking were tested, 1 μg of the catalytic subunit was added to 11 μg of microsomes in buffer A, and phosphorylation was conducted for 10 min at room temperature before initiating cross-linking by the addition of BMH. For PKA experiments, the final concentration of BMH was increased to 2.0 mm to compensate for the ∼1.5 mm final concentration of mercaptoethanol contributed by the PKA preparation. In some experiments, ATP in buffer A was replaced by other nucleotides, as indicated. SDS-PAGE using 8% polyacrylamide (26Porzio M.A. Pearson A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 490: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 15Cornea R.L. Autry J.M. Chen Z. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For detection of PLB, blots were probed with anti-PLB monoclonal antibody, 2D12, which recognizes residues 7–13 of canine PLB. For detection of SERCA2a, blots were probed with anti-SERCA2a monoclonal antibody, 2A7-A1, which recognizes residues 386–396 of canine SERCA2a. Epitopes were mapped (27Koybayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28660-28668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using PepSpotsTM (Jerini Bio Tools). Antibody-binding protein bands were visualized by 125I-protein A and autoradiography and quantified using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager Fx. In two experiments, the procedure was modified slightly. In the experiment in which the anti-PLB monoclonal antibody effect on BMH cross-linking was examined (Fig. 4 A), the125I-protein A step was omitted, and the immunoblot was probed with 125I-2D12 directly, iodinated using IODO-GEN (Bio-Rad). This was done to eliminate interference from125I-protein A binding to the 2D12 antibody carried over from the cross-linking samples. In the experiment in which the PKA effect on cross-linking was examined (Fig. 4 B), the immunoblot was probed with our anti-PLB monoclonal antibody, 1F1, raised to residues 1–10 of canine PLB, instead of 2D12. In control experiments, we observed that phosphorylation of PLB at Ser16 by PKA partially inhibited 2D12 binding to PLB, apparently due to steric or conformational effects. Phosphorylation of PLB by PKA had no effect on 1F1 binding to PLB. Ca2+-ATPase activity of microsomes co-expressing SERCA2a and N30C-PLB was measured at 37 °C in the presence and absence of the anti-PLB antibody, 2D12, in buffer containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 3 mmMgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmNaN3, 3 μg/ml A23187, 3 mm ATP, and 1 mm EGTA (13Autry J.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In order to identify which Cys residue of SERCA2a was cross-linked to N30C-PLB, we scaled up the cross-linking reaction 15,000-fold to allow purification of the two cross-linked proteins to homogeneity. Proteolysis was then performed, and the SERCA2a peptide covalently attached to PLB was isolated and sequenced. For maximal cross-linking, 166 mg of Sf21 microsomes co-expressing N30C-PLB and SERCA2a were cross-linked with 0.1 mm BMH for 1 h at room temperature in 180 ml of buffer A. 10 mmdithiothreitol was added to terminate the cross-linking reaction, and the sample was sedimented to yield the cross-linked microsomal pellet. Three rounds of sequential monoclonal antibody-affinity chromatographies were then used to obtain a purified SERCA2a peptide covalently attached to N30C-PLB, as follows. In round 1, SERCA2a was isolated from the cross-linked microsomal pellet using anti-SERCA (2A7-A1) monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography essentially as described previously (28Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. O'Brian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The microsomal pellet was dissolved in 1% SDS followed by 3.5% Triton X-100, and 64 ml of solubilized microsomal proteins were loaded over 6.6 ml of 2A7-A1 affinity beads. A flow-through fraction was collected, and the beads were then washed with four consecutive 6.6-ml rinses of 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (fractions 1–4), followed by three additional 6.6-ml rinses with 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (fractions 5–7). Purified SERCA2a was then eluted in fractions 8–12 with consecutive 6.6-ml rinses of 20 mm glycine (pH 2.4), 0.1% Triton X-100. Fractions 8–12 were eluted into 110 volume of concentrated MOPS buffer to return the pH to 7.2. Column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting. For economy, only results from peak column fractions are displayed in the figures. In round 2, fractions 8–12 from round 1 containing purified SERCA2a were pooled and subjected to anti-PLB (2D12) monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography (28Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. O'Brian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Pooled fractions 8–12 from round 1 were re-equilibrated in 1% SDS, 3.5% Triton X-100 and then loaded over 2.8 ml of 2D12 affinity beads. The column was processed identically to that described for round 1, employing 2.8-ml rinses for each fraction. The Ca2+-ATPase molecules not cross-linked to N30C-PLB passed freely through the column and were recovered in the flow-through fraction and fraction 1. Only SERCA2a molecules cross-linked to N30C-PLB were retained by the column and recovered in the acidic pH elution fractions (fractions 8–12). Fractions 8–12 were eluted into concentrated MOPS to return the pH to 7.2 as described above. In round 3, the purified, cross-linked product from round 2 was proteolyzed, and the cross-linked peptide was isolated. Fractions 8–12 from round 2 in 90 mm MOPS, 18 mm glycine, and 0.1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.2) were pooled and Amicon-concentrated to 1 ml. 8 μg of endo-Asp-N was then added, and proteolysis was conducted for 4 h at 37 °C. Digestion was terminated by adding 10 mm EDTA, and then 20 μg of endo-Lys-C was added, and the proteolysis continued overnight at 37 °C. The next morning, endo-Lys-C digestion was terminated by the addition of 0.3 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-l-2-heptanone, followed by the addition of 1% SDS and placement of the sample in a boiling water bath for 10 min. 3.5% Triton X-100 was then added, and the SERCA2a peptide cross-linked to N30C-PLB was isolated using anti-PLB monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography as described in round 2 above. Peptides were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-PSQ (Millipore Corp.) for sequencing. Sequencing was with an Applied Biosystems 492 Protein Sequencer at the Laboratory for Macromolecular Structure (Purdue University, W. Lafayette, IN). To screen for residues of PLB interacting with SERCA2a, we performed Cys-scanning mutagenesis of PLB and co-expressed the PLB mutants with wild-type SERCA2a in Sf21 microsomes (13Autry J.M.

Fig. 1 shows cross-linking results obtained when single Cys replacements at residues 30–41 of PLB were scanned for cross-linking to SERCA2a. (Upstream and downstream PLB mutations have subsequently been scanned, which will be reported on in a later work.) Sf21 microsomes from each co-expression were incubated with 0.1 mm BMH for 60 min in buffer A and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The blots were probed with anti-PLB monoclonal antibody 2D12 (Fig. 1 A) and anti-SERCA2a monoclonal antibody 2A7-A1 (Fig. 1 B). PLB with the single Cys replacement at residue 30 (N30C-PLB) cross-linked strongly to SERCA2a, as indicated by the very intense anti-PLB signal obtained at a molecular mass just greater than 100 kDa (Fig.1 A, PLB/SER). This PLB-positive band corresponded to the 6-kDa PLB monomer (4Fujii J.K. Ueno A. Kitano K. Tanaka S. Kadoma M. Tada M. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) cross-linked to the 109-kDa Ca2+ pump protein (13Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). None of the other PLB mutants tested cross-linked to SERCA2a (Fig. 1 A); nor did wild-type PLB with all three Cys residues left intact (data not shown). All mutated PLB molecules were efficiently expressed and are seen in different mobility forms ranging from pentamers (PLB 5 ) through monomers (PLB 1 ) at the bottom of the immunoblot (Fig. 1 A). SERCA2a was also expressed well in all of the microsomal preparations, and a slight mobility shift was evident in the Ca2+ pump protein after it was cross-linked to N30C-PLB (Fig. 1 B). Maximal cross-linking of N30C-PLB to SERCA2a by 0.1 mm BMH in buffer A was achieved at an incubation time of 60 min; half-maximal cross-linking occurred at 15 min (Fig.2 A). The mobility of the SERCA2a band decreased gradually with increasing cross-linking (Fig.2 B), but due to the broadness of the Ca2+ pump band and the absence of clear doublet formation, the mobility shift could not be used to accurately assess the percentage of Ca2+-ATPase molecules cross-linked, which is considerable (see Fig. 8). When cross-linking was conducted for 60 min in buffer A, half-maximal cross-linking of N30C-PLB to SERCA2a occurred at a BMH concentration of 20–30 μm; maximal cross-linking was achieved at 100 μm BMH (Fig. 2 C). Twenty-fold higher concentrations of BMH (2 mm) gave no additional cross-linking (data not shown).Figure 8Purification of SERCA2a cross-linked to N30C-PLB using anti-PLB monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography (round 2).

Std., protein standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Under the conditions of SDS-PAGE utilized, N30C-PLB (expressed on the Cys-less PLB background) migrated primarily as a monomer (Fig. 2,A and C, lane 1). BMH induced the rapid dimerization of PLB monomers, a process that was already complete at an incubation time of 5 min in the presence of 0.1 mmBMH (Fig. 2 A, lane 2, PLB 2 ), when only 14% of the maximal level of PLB·SERCA2a heterodimers had formed, or at an incubation time of 60 min in the presence at 10 μm BMH (Fig. 2 C, lane 2,PLB 2 ), when only 6% of the maximal level of PLB·SERCA2a heterodimers had formed. We found that even without cross-linking agents, N30C-PLB could retain pentamers on SDS-PAGE but that these pentamers were unstable and dissociated readily at low concentrations of SDS (Fig. 2 D). With only 0.2% SDS in the sample loading buffer prior to electrophoresis, N30C-PLB was mostly pentameric on SDS-PAGE; with 1.4% or higher concentrations of SDS in the sample loading buffer, the protein was mostly monomeric, with some dimers (Fig. 2 D). These results suggest that in intact microsomal membranes, N30C-PLB is predominantly a pentamer. Cross-linking between PLB monomers preassembled as pentamers is expected to be a very rapid process (29Guan L. Murphy F.D. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3475-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of PLB monomers to SERCA2a, in contrast, is a slower process. It should be pointed out that even after rapid homodimer formation by PLB monomers within pentamers, there should always be at least one uncross-linked monomer per pentamer that is free to dissociate from the complex and interact with SERCA2a. Using purified PLB and SERCA2a as standards, we calculated a molar ratio of 4:1 for N30C-PLB to SERCA2a in Sf21 microsomes. A molar ratio of 2:1 for the naturally occurring proteins in dog cardiac SR vesicles was found. PLB inhibits the Ca2+-ATPase at low ionized Ca2+ concentration by decreasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+(5Cantilina T. Sagara Y. Inesi G. Jones L.R. J. Biol.

In mammalian tissues, a single gene, slo (KCNMA1), encodes these big conductance, Ca2+-activated potassium channels (4Atkinson N.S. Robertson G.A. Ganetzky B. Science. 1991; 253: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the phenotype of BKCa channels varies widely between tissues, between cells of the same tissue (5Navaratnam D.S.

Several factors that contribute individually to this diversity have been identified, including alternative splicing (9Adelman J.P. Shen K.Z. Kavanaugh M.P. Warren R.A., Wu, Y.N. Lagrutta A. Bond C.T.

Sci. 2001; 22: 505-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), but the influence of these factors on one another has not been studied in detail. For example, most recombinant forms of BKCachannels are stimulated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 (15Nara M. Dhulipala P.D. Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14920-14924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but the response of BKCa channels to PKA in a mouse pituitary cell line, AtT20 (16Shipston M.J.

Nelson C. Salkoff L. Lingle C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, most studies of recombinant BKCa channel regulation by protein phosphorylation have employed a cDNA that begins at the third potential initiator methionine (MDALI-) encoded by the slogene (19McCobb D.P. Fowler N.L. Featherstone T. Lingle C.J. Saito M. Krause J.E. Salkoff L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H767-H777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), omitting up to 65 amino acids in the N terminus. Because this extracellular N-terminal sequence of the pore-forming α subunit interacts with the β subunit (20Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14922-14927Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), which also increases calcium sensitivity, we postulated that these structural changes might interact with one another. In addition, we wondered whether some of the variability in the regulation of BKCa channels by exogenous protein kinases might result from nonspecific effects associated with stimulation of the channel by the sulfhydryl reducing agents (21DiChiara T.J. Reinhart P.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4942-4955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wang Z.W. Nara M. Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), which are routinely included in purified preparations of the enzymes. We have previously characterized the regulation of native BKCa channels by protein phosphorylation in a rat pituitary cell line, GH4C1 (23White R.E. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 24White R.E. Lee A.B. Shcherbatko A.D. Lincoln T.M. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L.

These channels are stimulated by the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and inhibited by PKA, which is consistent with effects of hypothalamic neuropeptides on pituitary cell excitability and secretion (26Lamberts S.W. Macleod R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 279-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and with BKCa channel behavior in cell-free patches from GH4C1 cells (27Hall S.K. Armstrong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3749-3754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, to date no one has reported a recombinant form of BKCa that displays all these properties. Therefore, we believed it would be instructive to identify the structural basis for BKCa regulation in the GH4C1 cells. The data reveal new interactions between the extracellular N terminus and the cytoplasmic C terminus of the BKCa α subunit with potential physiological significance for channel regulation by calcium, oxidation, and phosphorylation. HEK293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line (ATCC CRL-1573), were cultured on glass coverslips (Deutsche Spiegelglas, Carolina Biological) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (H-21) supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Channel constructs in the pCI-neo vector were coexpressed transiently with a plasmid-encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) at a DNA ratio of 8:1 using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. In less than 24 h, excised patches from weakly fluorescent cells contained hundreds of BKCa channels. Stable cell lines for single-channel recordings were generated by transfection of Ecr293 cells (Invitrogen), a HEK cell line stably expressing the ecdysone receptor, with constructs in the ecdysone-inducible pIND vector (Invitrogen) and selected in G418. When these cells were grown in the absence of ecdysone, basal transcription from the plasmid was sufficient to produce just enough channels for reliable single-channel recording from excised patches of membrane. Native BKCachannels were studied in GH4C1 cells, a rat pituitary cell line, which were cultured in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, 15% equine serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and 10 mg/liter phenol red as described previously (27Hall S.K. Armstrong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3749-3754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It should be noted that GH4C1 cells cultured without phenol red had a much lower incidence of BKCa modulation by PKA (19%, n = 3/16) than cells in phenol red, which showed inhibition by PKA in 85% of patches (n = 22/26). Both rSlo and β1 subunits of the BKCa channel were cloned by RT-PCR from total GH4C1 cell RNA using primers based on the GenBank™ sequences U55995 isolated from adult female rat myometrium and U79661 from rat cerebral vascular smooth muscle. AnEcoRI-MluI oligonucleotide adapter designed to encode an N-terminal FLAG epitope with a short linker region (MVDYKDDDKLGGGATR) was inserted into a multiple cloning site of pCI (Promega) to generate pCI-FLAG. The forward primer covered U55995nucleotides 64–87 (5′-ATG AGC AAT ATC CAC GCG AAC CAT), whereas the reverse primer was from nucleotides 3574–3597 (the reverse complement of 5′-CCA GAA ACA TTC AAA TCA AGC CCA taaagcggccgc) and included a TAA stop codon and NotI cloning site. An endogenousMluI site (position 98 in U55995) was used as the 5′-cloning site for the PCR product. This necessitated the insertion of an adapter oligonucleotide sequence between the MluI site in the pCI-FLAG vector and the internal rSlo MluI site to encode the N-terminal 12 amino acids of the mature peptide reported in U55995. The resulting clone expressed rSlo-FLAG. The N-terminal FLAG sequences were removed from rSlo-FLAG by swapping out anEcoRI-MluI fragment with the oligonucleotide sequence 5′-GAA TTC CCC ATG AGC AAT ATC CAC GCG AAC CAT CTC AGC CTA GAC GCG T-3′ to generate rSlo. Five full-length clones of the rSlo α subunit were isolated independently in separate PCR reactions and sequenced on both strands. All clones contained identical N and C termini (Fig. 1) with no inserts at known sites of alternative splicing. The GH4C1 clone of rSlo is identical to the rat smooth muscle sequence (U55995) up to Gln-1140, but then it encodes only seven additional amino acids before terminating in a stop codon. The strex insert was isolated from total GH4C1cell RNA by RT-PCR using an anchored deoxyoligo (dT) primer (5′-TTCTAgAATTCAgCggCCgC(T)30N1N2) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for first-strand cDNA synthesis and forward (5′-gTC CTT CCC TAC TgT TTg) and reverse (5′-gTg TTT gAg CTC ATg ATA gT) PCR primers spanning splice site 2. Inserts containing rat strex were sequenced on both strands and subcloned into unique BlpI and PacI restriction sites of rSlo to give the rSlo-strex construct (Fig. 1). N-terminal truncations (ΔN) of both rSlo and rSlo-strex were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the initiator methionine (MSNIH-) to alanine, forcing transcription to begin at the next potential initiator methionine, MDALI- (Fig. 1). Slo channel currents were recorded in the excised inside-out configuration using an EPC9 patch-clamp amplifier/interface (HEKA) and an Apple Power Macintosh computer running Pulse software (HEKA) for generation of pulses and data acquisition. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–24 °C). Whenever BK channel modulators were applied to the patch, the recording chamber (0.2 ml of effective volume) was perfused with at least 10× the bath volume using a gravity-driven system at a flow rate of 1–2 ml/min. Patch pipettes were manufactured from Corning 7052 glass with resistances of 2.5–4.5 MΩ for single-channel recordings and 1.5–2.5 MΩ for pipettes used to record macroscopic currents from patches with high channel densities. To minimize series resistance errors, the access resistance was partially compensated (∼60%), and analysis was limited to patches with currents ≤3 nA at 150 mV. Dehydrosoyasaponin-I was prepared as a crude extract as published (28McManus O.B. Harris G.H. Giangiacomo K.M. Feigenbaum P. Reuben J.P. Addy M.E. Burka J.F. Kaczorowski G.J. Garcia M.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6128-6133Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). ATP was added as the Mg-salt and cyclic nucleotides cGMP and cAMP as Na-salts (Calbiochem). Okadaic acid, PKG (recombinant bovine isoform Iα), and the PKA inhibitor (6–22 amide) were obtained from Calbiochem, and the PKA catalytic subunit from Biolab. An anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, F-3165) was purchased from Sigma. Unfixed cells were stained in complete medium with serum for 20 min, washed 3× with complete medium, and exposed to 1 μg/ml of a second antibody, Alexa FluorÆ488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), in complete medium for 15 min. For cell-free recordings from excised inside-out patches of membrane, the patch pipette, which contacts the extracellular side of the membrane, contained either physiological saline (in mm): 135, NaCl; 10 HEPES; 1, MgCl2; 0.1, CaCl2 with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH, or symmetrical K+ solution (in mm): 135, KCl; 10, HEPES; 1, MgCl2; 0.1, CaCl2 with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. The standard bath solution for the former cytoplasmic side of the patch was (in mm): 145, KCl; 20, HEPES; 1, MgCl2; and 0.1, dithiothreitol with the pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. Bath solutions were passed over a Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) ion-exchange column, prior to adding Ca2+ buffers and divalent ions in order to remove potential metal contaminants. To buffer calcium reliably without saturation at physiological concentrations between 0.1 and 10 μm, we used the Mg- and pH-insensitive buffer, BAPTA, and its lower affinity dibromo derivative (Molecular Probes). Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated with WinMAXC (www.stanford.edu/∼spatton/maxc.html). The actual free Ca2+ concentrations were independently verified with a calcium electrode (Orion, Model 97–20 ionoplus), which was calibrated with buffered calcium solutions (Molecular Probes, Buffer kit 2 with 1 mm Mg). Single-channel open probability (Po) was derived either from single-channel analysis using TAC and TACFit (Bruxton) for patches with 1–3 channels, or in the case of patches with 4–15 channels, by the integration-over-baseline technique using Igor Pro (WaveMetrix). In the latter case N*Po values were determined as follows. All-point histograms were plotted to obtain the offset, i.e. leak current, as well as the single-channel current amplitude from the peak intervals. After subtraction of the offset from the traces these were integrated over 10–60-s segments. The integral divided by integration time and single-channel current amplitude gives N*Po. Statistical significance of differences between treatments was evaluated using an unpaired Student's t test on the N*Po or Po averages obtained from several minutes of recordings. The voltage-dependence of Slo currents was either measured from Po versus membrane potential plots (patches with 1–3 channels), or in the case of patches with macroscopic currents, from normalized plots of the tail currents recorded in symmetrical K+ solution at −70 mV. Plots of Po or normalized tail current amplitudes were fitted with a Boltzmann curve and the voltage of half-maximal activation (V12), derived from 1/(1 + exp(Vm−V12)/k). The BKCa α subunit channel protein encoded by the rSlo cDNA isolated from GH4C1 RNA (Fig. 1) is identical to the rat smooth muscle sequence (U55995) up to Gln-1140 and almost as similar to clones from mouse and human brain (29Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 30Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D. Krause J.D. Mertz R. Godinot N. DiChiara T.J. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1315-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The GH4C1 rSlo cDNA was expressed efficiently in HEK293 cells and produced robust currents activated by depolarization and cytoplasmic calcium (Fig.2). Expression of the entire cDNA was confirmed by addition of a FLAG epitope to the N terminus (see “Experimental Procedures”), which was detected immunologically at the surface of intact cells (Fig. 2A), as predicted (31Meera P. Wallner M. Song M. Toro L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14066-14071Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Excised patches of membrane expressing rSlo produced currents in the nanoampere range (Fig. 2B), corresponding to hundreds of functional BKCa channels in each square micrometer of membrane. With or without the FLAG epitope, the channels in such patches showed relative sensitivities to depolarization and cytoplasmic calcium (Fig. 2C) comparable to native channels from GH4C1 cells (27Hall S.K. Armstrong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3749-3754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, on average, 17-mV depolarization produced an e-fold increase in activity at any fixed calcium. Similarly a 10-fold increase in the calcium concentration at the cytoplasmic surface shifted the voltage required for half-maximal stimulation by 50 mV toward more negative potentials. However, the absolute sensitivity of the channels to calcium was 10-fold lower than native channels, which are stimulated half-maximally by 1 μm calcium at approximately +20 mV (27Hall S.K. Armstrong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3749-3754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The rSlo channels also differed from native BKCa channels in GH4C1 cells by their response to adenine nucleotides on the cytoplasmic side of the patch (Fig.3). In patches from GH4C1 cells, addition of Mg-ATP inhibits channel activity through protein phosphorylation by PKA (27Hall S.K. Armstrong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3749-3754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which is reversed by a peptide inhibitor of PKA (Fig. 3A;n = 5 patches). In contrast, rSlo inhibition by 0.5 mm ATP in patches from HEK293 cells is not blocked by the PKA inhibitor peptide (n = 0/3) and is mimicked by a nonhydrolysable analogue of ATP (AMP-PNP) (Fig. 3B,n = 4/4). This direct inhibitory effect of adenine nucleotides on recombinant BKCa channels is similar to the effect reported previously on a cDNA from mouse brain, mb2 (32Clark A.G. Hall S.K. Shipston M.J. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which has identical N and C termini as the rSlo cDNA from GH4C1 cells (29Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As reported by Clark et al. (32Clark A.G. Hall S.K. Shipston M.J. J.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1728-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have identified a 59-amino acid exon, strex, in the C terminus near the calcium-binding site (Fig. 1,C and D), which is required for BKCachannel inhibition by PKA (17Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond M.S. Coghill L.S. Wen H. Rusinova R. Clark A.G. Levitan I.B. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7717-7720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Expression of rSlo with the strex exon inserted in place of L668 (rSlo-strex) in HEK cells produced BKCa channels that were inhibited by PKA (Fig.4). Even in patches with quasi-macroscopic currents, addition of ATP and cAMP reduced the activity of all the channels, increasing the voltage required to produce half-maximal activity by +20 mV (Fig. 4A), which is quantitatively very similar to the effect of PKA on native BKCa channels in GH4C1 cells (27Hall S.K. Armstrong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3749-3754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). At the single-channel level, ATP/cAMP reduced activity in 86% of the patches (n = 12/14) producing on average a 49% decrease (Fig. 4B). Unlike the effect of ATP on rSlo channels, inhibition of rSlo-strex channels by ATP/cAMP was reversed by a peptide inhibitor of PKA, PKA-I, which increased channel activity in the presence of ATP/cAMP by 67% on average (n = 6, Fig. 4C). Thus, endogenous PKA and phosphatase molecules appear to be associated closely with the BKCa channel in cell-free patches of membrane. Inclusion of the strex exon also increased the sensitivity of recombinant BKCa channels to inhibition by oxidation (Fig.5). Native BKCa channels in GH4C1 cells showed a wide range of sensitivity to oxidation (Fig. 5C), which was measured by replacing 1 mm dithiothreitol with 0.1 mm thimerosal (22Wang Z.W. Nara M. Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Some native channels were inhibited 2–3-fold by thimerosal (Fig.5A), whereas other native BKCa channels were much more sensitive to inhibition (Fig. 5B). Recombinant rSlo channels in HEK cells were uniformly less sensitive to inhibition by oxidation (Fig. 5C), which is comparable to the sensitivity reported previously for other recombinant channels (22Wang Z.W. Nara M. Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, rSlo-strex channels were an order of magnitude more sensitive to inhibition by thimerosal (Fig. 5C). Although thimerosal inhibited the activity of rSlo channels to 40% of their control activity in dithiothreitol (n = 7), the same concentration of thimerosal inhibited 95% of the activity of rSlo-strex channels (n = 6). The increased sensitivity of rSlo-strex channels to inhibition by oxidation is consistent with the high cysteine content of the strex exon (18Saito M. Nelson C. Salkoff L. Lingle C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and provides additional evidence that native BKCa channels in GH4C1 cells, like the BKCa channels in mouse pituitary cells (16Shipston M.J. Duncan R.R. Clark A.G. Antoni F.A. Tian L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1728-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), also contain the strex exon. Nevertheless, rSlo-strex channels also differed from the native channels in GH4C1 cells in one essential feature; their absolute sensitivity to stimulation by calcium. Although inclusion of the strex exon shifted the calcium sensitivity of rSlo by ∼20 mV toward more negative potentials (Fig.6), as reported previously for other recombinant channels (8Xie J. McCobb D.P. Science. 1998; 280: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 18Saito M. Nelson C. Salkoff L. Lingle C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11710-11717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), membrane potentials more positive than +75 mV were required to produce half-maximal activation of rSlo-strex in 2 μm calcium (Fig. 6A). In contrast, half-maximal activation of native BKCa channels under similar conditions occurs at voltages around +20 mV (27Hall S.K. Armstrong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3749-3754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which are routinely observed during spontaneous spiking. Surprisingly, coexpression of the rat β1 subunit from GH4C1 cells did not alter the calcium sensitivity of rSlo-strex (Fig. 6A) even though β1 did alter the kinetics of gating (Fig. 6B) and the sensitivity to stimulation by dehydrosoyasaponin-I (Fig.6C), indicating efficient expression of β1 and interaction with the α subunit (33McManus O.B. Helms L.M. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Swanson R. Leonard R.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 645-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The insensitivity to calcium was also not an artifact of the HEK cell expression system. Mutation of tyrosine 294 to valine at the external mouth of the pore (34Shen K.Z. Lagrutta A. Davies N.W. Standen N.B. Adelman J.P. North R.A. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 426: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) eliminated the sensitivity of rSlo-strex to inhibition by external tetraethylammonium (not shown) and allowed us to study its calcium sensitivity in GH4C1 cells without contamination by native channels. Nevertheless, Y294V-strex channels in GH4C1 cells were just as insensitive to calcium as rSlo-strex channels in HEK293 cells (Fig. 6A). In other studies of recombinant BKCa channels (33McManus O.B. Helms L.M. Pallanck L. Ganetzky B. Swanson R. Leonard R.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 645-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 35Cox D.H. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 411-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the β1subunit is highly effective at increasing calcium sensitivity, shifting the voltage required for half-maximal activation at a given concentration of calcium toward more negative potentials by 50 mV or more. Because many of the studies used clones that began MDALI- in the N terminus, we also expressed truncated forms of rSlo and rSlo-strex that began at MDALI, which we labeled rSloΔN and rSloΔN-strex, respectively (Fig. 1). The calcium sensitivity of rSloΔN is slightly higher than rSlo (Fig. 7A), but strex inclusion at splice site 2 in rSloΔN shifted the voltage required for half-maximal activation toward more negative potentials by >40 mV (Fig. 7A). In addition, coexpression of β1 shifted rSloΔN-strex by a further 25 mV toward more negative voltages (Fig. 7A). Thus, the absolute calcium sensitivity of rSloΔN-strex is very similar to native BKCa channels in GH4C1 cells. Furthermore, rSloΔN-strex retains the native property of simultaneous sensitivity to inhibition by PKA and stimulation by PKG (Fig. 7,B and C). On average, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation inhibited rSloΔN-strex channel activity by 45.5% (n = 8), whereas cGMP-dependent phosphorylation stimulated activity in 13 of 20 patches by 89%. In both cases, regulation was mediated by endogenous protein kinases, which remained associated with the channels in cell-free patches of membrane. The big-conductance, calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channels BKCa encoded by the slo gene (KCNMA1) play a powerful integrative role in the regulation of electrical excitability in many tissues, so it is not surprising that they are also regulated by a complex network of signal transduction pathways. Many of these regulatory mechanisms have been identified, but this is the first study that specifically investigates the interactions between them on recombinant channels. We previously characterized the regulation of native BKCa channels by reversible protein phosphorylation in a rat pituitary cell line, GH4C1 (23White R.E. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1991; 351: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 24White R.E. Lee A.B. Shcherbatko A.D. Lincoln T.M. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L.

Armstrong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3749-3754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study we have identified a structural variant of the rSlo gene product, rSloΔN-strex (Fig. 1), which recapitulates that regulation (Fig. 7). Furthermore, when it is coexpressed with β1 subunits, rSloΔN-strex is just as sensitive to calcium as native channels (Fig.7). The requirement of strex inclusion in Slo channels for inhibition by PKA has been observed previously in murine BKCa channels cloned from a mouse pituitary cell line (16Shipston M.J. Duncan R.R. Clark A.G. Antoni F.A. Tian L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1728-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), where it was shown that PKA produces inhibition by phosphorylating a serine in the strex exon (17Tian L. Duncan R.R.

Whereas X11α interacts with APP via its phosphotyrosine-binding domain, recent reports indicate that additional regulatory interactions involve the N terminus of X11. Here we report that the syntaxin-1a-binding protein Munc18a, which interacts with the Munc18a-interacting domain (MID) at the N terminus of X11, strongly regulates the actions of X11 on APP metabolism. When co-expressed with X11α, Munc18a potentiated the retention of APP and suppression of Aβ secretion by X11α. As a result, the constitutive release of Aβ40 was nearly abolished. Experiments using N terminus deletion mutants of X11α/β and the MID-deficient X11γ revealed that the majority of the regulatory effect by Munc18a occurred independent of a direct interaction of Munc18a with X11, although the presence of X11 was required. Munc18a expression induced a small increase in β-secretase activity, whereas it also intensified the reduction in Aβ40 secretion by X11α. These data indicate that Munc18a in concert with X11 acts to suppress γ-secretase processing. We conclude that Munc18a acts through direct and indirect interactions with X11 proteins and powerfully regulates APP metabolism and Aβ secretion.

Aβ peptides were derived from proteolytic processing of a precursor protein, namely amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cleavage sites and extent of processing depend on its trafficking pathways as different APP derivatives have been mapped to distinct compartments of the cell, presumably where specific APP processing enzymes, or secretases, reside (2Koo E.H.

A major pathway for Aβ production involves internalization of APP, as directed by an ENPTY sequence at the C terminus of APP, following its delivery to the plasma membrane (7Lai A. Sisodia S.S.

In conjunction with lin-2 and lin-7, lin-10 has been shown to be required for the precise targeting and localization of certain membrane proteins, such as the GLR-1 glutamate receptor (17Rongo C.

Similar to lin-10, X11 proteins possess multiple protein interacting domains (see Fig. 1A) and have been ascribed to function as adaptor proteins that were critical for protein trafficking (19Biederer T.

It has therefore been postulated that X11 may modulate APP metabolism by altering the trafficking and distribution of APP (24McLoughlin D.M. Irving N.G. Brownlees J. Brion J.P. Leroy K. Miller C.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1988-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There were several lines of evidence to support a role of X11 proteins in the APP metabolic pathway. First, X11α and -β co-localize with APP in neurons and when expressed heterologously in cell lines (16Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

Second, mutations in the C terminus of APP that diminished interaction between X11α and APP also impaired the internalization of APP (12Zhang Z. Lee C.H. Mandiyan V. Borg J.P. Margolis B.

Third, overexpression of X11α or X11β proteins have been shown to increase the cellular APP level, increase release of a secreted form of APP (APPs), and inhibit Aβ secretion (13Borg J.P.

Although the mechanism is not known, several recent findings have suggested that these effects involved interactions of X11 with additional proteins. For instance, it has been shown that both X11α and -β can directly interact with presenilin-1, a protein that is genetically linked to γ-secretase activities, through their PDZ domains (30Lau K.F. McLoughlin D.M. Standen C. Miller C.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C-terminal PDZ domain of X11β was reported to suppress the NF-κB/p65-induced Aβ42 secretion and this effect did not require the binding of X11 to APP (28Tomita S. Fujita T. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13056-13060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel perinuclear/endoplasmic reticulum-localized protein termed XB51 was shown to interact with the N-terminal of X11β and abolished the interaction between APP and X11β (27Lee D.S. Tomita S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23134-23138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Munc18a is a protein essential for Ca2+-regulated exocytosis and membrane trafficking in neurons (31Rowe J. Corradi N. Malosio M.L. Taverna E. Halban P. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of importance, Munc18a also interacts with an MID domain at the N-terminal half of X11α and X11β, and therefore X11 proteins have also been named Mint (Munc18-interacting) proteins (32Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 33Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). X11γ lacks an MID and exhibited no interaction with Munc18a in a yeast two-hybrid assay (33Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The deletion of the N-terminal region including the MID from X11β has been shown to reduce its affinity to APP, even though the PTB domain for APP interaction remained intact (16Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Deletion of a comparable region in X11α also abolished its effect in promoting APPs-β secretion (29Mueller H.T. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39302-39306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). X11α, X11β, as well as Munc18a show specific expression in the nervous system, however, the physiological consequence of their interaction within neurons was currently not known (34Nakajima Y. Okamoto M. Nishimura H. Obata K. Kitano H. Sugita M. Matsuyama T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 92: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The central focus of the current investigation was to test the hypothesis that Munc18a, through its interaction with X11, modulates APP metabolism and Aβ secretion. We have compared the actions of X11α, X11β, X11γ, and the N termini deleted mutants of X11α and -β on APP metabolism. We demonstrate that a strong synergistic effect exists between Munc18a and X11 proteins on APP processing. In addition, although the MID domain was sufficient and essential for a direct Munc18a interaction, we found that a portion of the synergistic effect was mediated via indirect interactions. X11β, X11γ, Myc-tagged human X11α and its deletion mutants in pRK5 vector were obtained from Dr. Ben Margolis, University of Michigan. The Swedish mutant of APP (APPsw; K595N/M596L) was used in this study instead of wild-type APP to enhance the β-secretase activity in HEK293 cells to mimic neuronal APP metabolism and to increase the Aβ40 level in conditioned medium. It also facilitated analysis of β-secretase activity of transfected cells by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay described below. X11β, X11βΔN, X11γ, and rat Munc18a were subcloned into engineered pcDNA3.1 vectors with either a Myc tag or a His6 tag at the N-terminal. Munc18a, His-X11β, His-X11γ, and His-X11βMID were subcloned into pGEX-KG vector to produce recombinant proteins in bacteria. The MID construct used in this study, which spans amino acid residues 179–282 of human X11β, covers the region aligned to the MID mapped in rat X11α (32Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were replenished with fresh medium 2–4 h before transfection and they were transfected at ∼30–50% confluence using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. Plasmid DNA constructs for transfection were prepared with a commercial kit (Qiagen). Plasmid vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) was used to monitor the transfection efficiency. Medium was changed 8–16 h after transfection. Two days after transfection, the transfected cells were fed with fresh medium. After 2–4 h of conditioning, the medium was collected. β-Secretase activity was determined by quantitating the amount of β-secretase cleavage product of APPsw secreted into the medium using a APPs-β sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously described (35Steinhilb M.L. Turner R.S. Gaut J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4476-4484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An affinity purified antibody (931) specific for the C terminus of the β-secretase cleavage product of APPsw was immobilized on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate and used to determine the APPs-β present in the media. Cells were lysed 2 days after transfection in lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were sonicated for 5 s with a high frequency cell disrupter and then centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were quantified for protein content using a commercial kit based on method of Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216261) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad). A fixed amount of protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry protocol. Myc-tagged X11α, X11β, and their deletion mutants were detected using a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10) developed by J. M. Bishop, which was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences. Munc18a was detected with a monoclonal antibody m32320 (Transduction Laboratories). Both the endogenous APP and the heterologously expressed APPsw were detected with a polyclonal anti-APP antiserum C15TZ (a gift from Dr. Edward H. Koo, University of California, San Diego). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) were used to reveal the presence of proteins of interest. ECL signals were quantitatively detected with the Fluor-S Max imaging system (Bio-Rad). Student's t test and the single factor ANOVA test followed by Tukey multiple comparisons were used to analyze the difference among groups of data. Data were presented as mean ± S.E. Cellular APP in freshly prepared cell lysates was immunoprecipitated using a mixture of 2 monoclonal antibodies (5A3 and 1G7) from Dr. Edward H. Koo. Myc-tagged X11α and X11αΔN were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9B11 from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. After the cell lysates (1 mg in 500 μl) were incubated with the antibodies at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 2 h to overnight, antibody-bound protein complexes were pulled down using Protein G (for anti-APP) or Protein A (for anti-Myc) immobilized on agarose beads (Pierce). After washing three times in phosphate-buffered saline, the pellets were loaded and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels together with their corresponding supernatants, final washes, and total cell lysates. The presence of APP, Munc18a, X11α, and X11αΔN were detected by immunoblots with appropriate antibodies as described above. GST fusion protein constructs were transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21RIL codon plus (Stratagene). Overexpression of fusion proteins was induced by 200 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2–6 h at 37 °C and the bacterial proteins were extracted using a French Press approach. GST fusion proteins were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). As initial experiments showed an interaction between the GST and Munc18a proteins, an in-frame His6 tag was added between the GST tag and X11β coding sequences after the thrombin cleavage site in the construct. The GST tag was removed by thrombin treatment (6.25 units/250 ml of culture for 2–4 h at 20 °C) and the His6 tag at the N terminus of the cleaved protein was used for affinity purification. Purified thrombin-cleaved His6-labeled X11 protein (75 nm) was incubated with 1 nm to 5 μm purified Munc18a in binding buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 2 h at 4 °C. Munc18a bound to His6-labeled X11 proteins was pulled down with TALON beads (CLONTECH). Pellets were washed three times by resuspending in binding buffer and centrifuged for 1 min at 800 × g at 4 °C. Supernatant from the final wash did not contain any Munc18a. The pellets were then resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and were resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Munc18a was detected by immunoblotting quantitatively as described above. Data were fit to a single site binding curve using a software based algorithm (Prizm by GraphPad) and normalized to the calculated maximum binding values (Bmax) from each experiment. Each binding curve was repeated 2–5 times. The general domain structure of X11α, -β, and -γ and the deletion mutant constructs used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1A. The PTB and PDZ domains were highly conserved among the three members of the X11 family with sequence identities between 60 and 90%, although their N-terminal regions differ drastically. The region of X11α essential for Munc18a interaction has been mapped to the MID region in the N-terminal half of the protein (residues 226–314) by yeast two-hybrid assay using overlapping rat cDNA clones (32Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This region was aligned to amino acid residues 196–266 in human X11β (Fig. 1, A and B). Because of the diverse sequences at the first half of this region, the N terminus of MID in X11β was not well defined. Within the MID region, there was a stretch of amino acid sequence, (D/E)QEEDIDQIVAE, highly conserved between X11α and X11β in human, mouse, and rat (Fig. 1B). A BLAST search using the peptide sequence from this area did not pull out other known protein sequences. Such a consensus motif was absent in X11γ, whereas in X11β, there was an additional partial repeat of motif DQEED in the upstream sequence. Immunoprecipitation of Munc18a with Myc-tagged X11α overexpressed in HEK293 cells indicates that these two proteins can interact in situ (Fig. 2A). Such interaction required the presence of the MID-containing N terminus of X11α, suggesting that the MID domain was essential for X11-Munc18a interaction. This finding was consistent with a previous report using a yeast two-hybrid assay (33Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To establish the binding relationship between X11β and Munc18a, each protein was expressed as an epitope-tagged fusion protein in bacteria and purified for analysis of in vitro binding. Fig.2B shows the binding relationship between Munc18a and X11β (n = 5). The EC50 was determined to be 281.5 nm. A similar binding assay determined a low level of interaction between His-tagged X11γ and Munc18a (EC50 = 3.5 μm), however, control experiments performed without X11 protein also exhibited a low level of nonspecific binding of Munc18a to the TALON beads (EC50 = 7.5 μm). This finding was consistent with a previous report that X11γ (Mint3) and Munc18a do not interact in a yeast two-hybrid assay (33Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The low affinity of the MID-deficient X11γ to Munc18a was consistent with the idea that the MID of X11 proteins was essential for high affinity Munc18a binding. To further establish if the MID alone was sufficient for Munc18a interaction, a stretch of cDNA encoding 104 amino acids (residues 179–282 of X11β; see Fig. 1, A andB) was amplified from X11β by PCR and subcloned into an engineered pGEX-KG vector with an in-frame His6 tag sequence. The EC50 of Munc18a interaction with this MID was determined in vitro to be 268.3 nm (Fig.2B). The binding curves of X11β and MID to Munc18a were, therefore, essentially superimposable. These data together with the very low specific binding of Munc18a to X11γ suggest that the MID of X11 proteins was both essential and sufficient for the full binding capacity of Munc18a. It has been shown that the X11α protein can interact with the C terminus of APP through its PTB domain (8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that an N-terminal binding partner of X11β may modulate the affinity between APP and X11β (16Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Because Munc18a specifically interacts with the MID domain at the N termini of X11α and X11β, we examined the effect of Munc18a on the APP-X11 interaction. APP was transfected alone or together with Myc-tagged X11α in the presence or absence of Munc18a into HEK 293 cells. APP was then immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibodies specific for the mid-region of APP that was within the extracellular portion of APP and away from the intracellular X11α interacting domain at the C terminus. As shown in Fig. 2C, APP immunoprecipitation led to co-immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged X11α protein. Although X11α was co-precipitated, a significant amount of X11α remained within the supernatant fraction. With the addition of Munc18a transfection, the amount of co-precipitated X11α was increased 8.4-fold (Fig. 2C). Surprisingly, the APP content in the lysates of triple transfected APPsw-Munc18a-X11α cells was also substantially higher compared with those cells co-transfected with APPsw and X11α leading to a 6.9-fold increase in immunoprecipitated APP. The increase in the co-precipitated X11α with co-expression of Munc18a was, therefore, proportional to the amount of APP present in the precipitate. It has previously been shown that X11α stabilizes APP and prolongs its half-life (13Borg J.P. Yang Y., De Taddéo-Borg M. Margolis B. Turner R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14761-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our data above suggested that Munc18a may act to further promote stabilization of APP. To determine whether co-expression of Munc18a with X11α potentiated cellular APP content, we quantitatively compared APP levels in the lysates of transfected cells. Our initial results confirmed that co-expression of X11α with APPsw in HEK293 cells increased the cellular APP levels (3.84 ± 0.92-fold of APPsw control, n = 7; Fig.3, panels A and B). The increased level of cellular APP was observed in both mature and immature form, but was more prominent in the latter (2.39 ± 0.43-fold for mature form versus 4.31 ± 1.42-fold for immature form; n = 7). In the absence of X11α, Munc18a by itself showed no effect on the cellular APP level (1.03 ± 0.10-fold of control, n = 7; Fig. 3, panels A and B). In contrast, co-expression of Munc18a and X11α in APPsw expressing HEK cells boosted the cellular APP level to 13.94 ± 0.88-fold of that observed in control cells transfected with APPsw alone. In other words, there was a 3.6-fold further increase (or a net increase of 10.1 times of control level) in cellular APP as a result of Munc18a co-expression. Such an additional increase in the APP level did not correlate to the small and insignificant increase in the X11α level caused by Munc18a expression (1.00 ± 0.07versus 1.24 ± 0.07; n = 8;p > 0.1, paired t test; Fig.3C). In addition to the effect of X11α on cellular APP level, we also observed that the protein level of overexpressed Munc18a was increased by 1.4-fold when they were co-transfected in the HEK cells (p < 0.005; Fig. 3D). Similar to X11α, the X11β and X11γ isoforms also contain a PTB domain and have been shown to interact with APP by yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays (16Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H.

It has also been demonstrated that X11β may inhibit the secretion of Aβ40 in APP695 stably transfected HEK293 cells (16Tomita S. Ozaki T. Taru H. Oguchi S. Takeda S. Yagi Y. Sakiyama S. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2243-2254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The effects of X11β on the cellular APP levels and the action of X11γ on APP processing have not, however, yet been established. Fig.4A shows that X11β increased the cellular level of APP by 61.3% (p < 0.05) when it was co-transfected with APPsw into HEK293 cells. In contrast to X11α and β, X11γ had no observable effect on cellular APP content (117 ± 24% of control, n = 7), even though it contains the PTB domain and interacts with the C terminus of APP. Because the major structural difference between X11α/β and X11γ was at the N-terminal half of the protein where the MID resides, these data suggest that Munc18a interacting at the N-terminal of X11α/β may be crucial for the effects of X11 on APP processing and support the idea that direct interactions between Munc18a and X11α/β may modulate the activity of X11 on APP processing. Co-expression of Munc18a with X11α resulted in"

We reported previously that the human trithorax leukemia fusion protein (HRX) can bind to GADD34 and abrogate GADD34-mediated apoptosis in response to UV irradiation. We found that hSNF5/INI1, a component of the hSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, also binds to GADD34 and can coexist with GADD34 and HRX fusion proteins as a trimolecular complexesin vivo. In the present report, we demonstrate that hSNF5/INI1 binds to GADD34 in part through the PP1 docking site within a domain homologous to herpes simplex virus-1 ICP34.5. We found that hSNF5/INI1 can bind PP1 independently and weakly stimulate its phosphatase activity in solution and in complex with GADD34. hSNF5/INI1 and PP1 do not compete for binding to GADD34 but rather form a stable heterotrimeric complex with GADD34. We also show that Epstein-Barr nuclear protein 2, which binds hSNF5/INI1, can disrupt hSNF5/INI1 binding to GADD34 and partially reverse the GADD34-mediated growth suppression function in Ha-ras expressing HIH-3T3 (3T3-ras) cells.

At its carboxyl terminus, GADD34 harbors a highly conserved domain homologous to ICP34.5 of HSV1, a virulence factor that blocks the premature shut off of protein synthesis in HSV1-infected neuroblastoma cells and may interfere with apoptosis (5Chou J.

Moreover, knockout mice haploinsufficient for the murine hSNF5 gene have been shown to be predisposed to the early occurrence of a solid tumor resembling malignant rhabdoid tumor (24Roberts C.W. Galusha S.A. McMenamin M.E. Fletcher C.D. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13796-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Thus, hSNF5/INI1 appears to be a classic tumor suppressor gene whose protein function may extend beyond chromatin remodeling. In fact, Brm and BRG-1 (two isoforms of the mammalian SWI2/SNF2 protein) have been found to be phosphorylated differentially at the G2/M transition (25Muchardt C. Reyes J.C. Bourachot B. Leguoy E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3394-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This modification leads to the exclusion of these proteins from the condensed chromosome during mitosis. Phosphorylated Brm is then targeted for degredation, and Brm accumulates in cells arrested in G0, apparently as a result of resynthesis upon exiting the cell cycle (22Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The observed association of GADD34 with hSNF5/INI1 prompted us to ask whether hSNF5/INI1 might participate in GADD34 function and whether the interaction with GADD34 might play a role in hSNF5/INI1 tumor suppression. In this report, we characterize further the interaction of hSNF5/INI1 with GADD34. We have mapped the hSNF5/INI1 interaction domain to a small region in GADD34 which encompasses the ICP34.5 homologous domain on GADD34. Alanine replacement of residues 555–558 (VRFS) results in a nearly complete disruption of the hSNF5/INI1-GADD34 interaction. We show here that hSNF5/INI1 can bind independently to the PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) and that GADD34, PP1c, and hSNF5/INI1 can coexist in a heterotrimeric complex in 293T cells. We further demonstrate that affinity-purified hSNF5/INI1 protein can stimulate PP1c activity in vitro. We show that competitive disruption of the GADD34-hSNF5/INI1 interaction by enforced expression of Epstein-Barr nuclear protein 2 (EBNA2) inhibits GADD34-mediated growth suppression of Ha-ras-expressing NIH-3T3 (3T3-ras) cells. Taken together, these results suggest that GADD34 mediates growth suppression at least in part through its interaction with hSNF5/INI1 and that hSNF5/INI1 may function as a regulatory subunit of PP1 either independently or as a part of the GADD34 complex.DISCUSSIONGADD34 is a cellular stress response protein whose transcript is regulated independently of functional cellular p53. Because ∼50% of all cancers have been estimated to harbor a mutation in p53 (41Hainaut P. Bull. Cancer. 2000; 87: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar), GADD34-mediated genotoxic response may well play an important role in cellular response to cancer therapy and perhaps to clinical outcome. Characterization of the components of the GADD34 functional pathway may lead to the identification of new targets for cancer drug development. In the present work, we present data supporting a role for hSNF5/INI1, a component of the hSWI/SNF complex, in the functions of GADD34. We show that a segment on GADD34 mediates hSNF5/INI1 binding, and this short stretch of amino acids resides in the region homologous to the functional domain in HSV1 ICP34.5, and the hSNF5/INI1 binding site overlaps the PP1 docking motif on GADD34. To our surprise, hSNF5/INI1 does not compete with PP1 for GADD34 binding; instead, all three proteins form a stable heterotrimeric complex in 293T cells overexpressing these proteins. hSNF5/INI1 binds to PP1 in vitro, and it modestly stimulates the PP1-specific phosphatase activity in solution and in the GADD34-bound protein complex. Thus hSNF5/INI1 fulfills the definition of a regulatory subunit of PP1c. The Epstein-Barr virus immortalization protein EBNA2 competes with GADD34 for binding to hSNF5/INI1 and can partially reverse growth suppression that is mediated by GADD34 when it is coexpressed with GADD34 in 3T3-ras cells.The type I serine/threonine phosphatase, PP1, regulates diverse cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, protein synthesis, muscle contraction, carbohydrate metabolism, transcription, and neuronal signaling (42Depaoli-Roach A.A. Park I.K. Cerovsky V. Csortos C. Durbin S.D. Kuntz M.J. Sitikov A. Tang P.M. Verin A. Zolnierowicz S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1994; 34: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). PP1 acquires specificity through its association with targeting regulatory subunits that direct the enzyme to specific cellular compartments and confer substrate specificity, and PP1 is also regulated by inhibitory subunits that control enzyme activity (43Aggen J.B. Nairn A.C. Chamberlin R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R13-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In general, the targeting regulatory subunits themselves do not serve as PP1 substrates (44Darman R.B. Flemmer A. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, hSNF5/INI1 appears to function as a targeting regulatory subunit; however, unlike the classical targeting proteins of PP1 hSNF5/INI1 can modulate PP1c activity (Fig. 4). Recently, GADD34 was shown to alter the substrate specificity of PP1c, maintaining the PP1 activity for phosphorylated eIF2α but reducing its activity for phosphorylated phosphorylase B (11Connor J.H. Weiser D.C., Li, S. Hallenbeck J.M. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6841-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although it remains to be determined whether hSNF5/INI1 would have a similar affect on PP1, an attractive hypothesis would involve the heterotrimeric GADD34·hSNF5/INI1·PP1 complex conferring substrate specificity to PP1 and targeting the enzyme to potential protein substrates associated with hSWI/SNF complex.The hSWI/SNF complex is composed of at least 12 protein subunits (19Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), and the purified complex can remodel chromatin in vitro (45Kwon H. Imbalzano A.N. Khavari P.A. Kingston R.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar,46Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In yeast, the SWI and SNF proteins are required for regulated transcription of a set of genes involved in metabolism and mating-type switching (47Carlson M. Laurent B.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and act both to activate and repress the transcription of a restricted set of genes (48Sudarsanam P. Winston F. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 345-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Yet, the mammalian SWI/SNF complex is clearly involved in functions in addition to transcription activation. Both mammalian SWI2 homologs BRG-1 and hBrm can bind to RB. hBrm in complex with retinoblastoma protein suppresses transcription factor E2F1 activity and can mediate G1 cell cycle arrest (49Trouche D., Le Chalony C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11268-11273Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Cells deficient in BRG-1 were found to be resistant to retinoblastoma protein-mediated cell cycle inhibition but could regain sensitivity through conditional expression of BRG-1 (50Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Both BRG-1 and hBrm have been found to be differentially phosphorylated in the cell cycle such that phosphorylation occurs during mitosis, and hBrm is excluded from the condensed chromatin (25Muchardt C. Reyes J.C. Bourachot B. Leguoy E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3394-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylated hBrm is targeted for degredation, the level of BRG-1 appears to be invariant. Purified BRG-1 containing hSWI/SNF complexes can be inactivated in vitro through phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and rendered incapable of nucleosome remodeling. The complex can then be reactivated by PP2A (46Sif S. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). BRG1, hBrm, and hSWI3, also known to be phosphorylated, are all possible substrates for PP1 within the hSWI/SNF complex.Both PP1 and hSNF5/INI1 associate with GADD34 at its ICP34.5 homologous domain. Previously the Src kinase Lyn and proliferating cell nuclear antigen have both been shown to interact with GADD34 through this domain (51Brown S.M. MacLean A.R. McKie E.A. Harland J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9442-9449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Grishin A.V. Azhipa O. Semenov I. Corey S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10172-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Lyn binds to a SH3-like motif 50 amino acids apart from the PP1 and hSNF5/INI1 binding site (52Grishin A.V. Azhipa O. Semenov I. Corey S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10172-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). GADD34 was found to be phosphorylated by Lyn in response to DNA damage. Although both GADD34 and Lyn have been implicated in the DNA damage response, the coexpression of Lyn curiously interferes with GADD34-mediated apoptosis. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding domain within the ICP34.5 homologous region has not been delineated further. Additionally, GADD34 has been demonstrated to interact with the kinesin family protein KIF3A, Translin, and a new member of the Hsp40 family of heat shock proteins in regions outside of the ICP34.5 domain (53Hasegawa T. Isobe K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 54Hasegawa T. Xiao H. Hamajima F. Isobe K. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Hasegawa T. Yagi A. Isobe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The role of these proteins and that of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in GADD34 function remains to be clarified.In the present report, the growth suppression function of GADD34 is assayed in the G12V Ha-ras transformed NIH-3T3 cells. The activation of ras pathways has been reported recently to down-regulate the expression of Brm, and the reintroduction of Brm intoras-transformed cells leads to partial reversion of the transformed phenotype (56Muchardt C. Bourachot B. Reyes J.C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We have found that the stable expression of wild-type GADD34 in 3T3-ras cells is possible (data not shown), suggesting that both transfection reagents and selection antibiotics may introduce cellular stress and lead to the observed GADD34 effects in clonogenic and short term survival assays. Our data also suggest that ras and GADD34 activation likely exert opposing effect on the hSWI/SNF complex function.EBNA2 is one of the six viral nuclear proteins expressed in latently infected B lymphocytes and has been found to be essential for the immortalization of B cells by Epstein-Barr virus. EBNA2 promotes transcriptional transactivation of viral and cellular genes by acting as an adaptor molecule that binds to cellular sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (57Laux G. Adam B. Strobl L.J. Moreau-Gachelin F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5624-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 58Henkel T. Ling P.D. Hayward S.D. Peterson M.G. Science. 1994; 265: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and transcription factors, including the hSWI/SNF complex (27Wu D.Y. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Schubach W.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated recently the targeting of the hSWI/SNF complex to both episomal and endogenous cellular chromatin at EBNA2-responsive DNA sites (37Wu D.Y. Krumm A. Schubach W.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8893-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This targeting is mediated through the interaction of EBNA2 with hSNF5/INI1. In the work presented here, we showed that EBNA2 can competitively disrupt the GADD34-hSNF5/INI1 interaction (Fig. 5 A) and can partially reverse the GADD34 growth suppression function when coexpressed with GADD34 (Fig. 6). Kempkes et al. (59Kempkes B. Zimber-Strobl U. Eissner G. Pawlita M. Falk M. Hammerschmidt W. Bornkamm G.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown that EBNA2 expression is essential for both establishment and maintenance of Epstein-Barr virus-induced transformation of primary normal B cells. EBNA2 expression also overcomes cell cycle arrest that normally occurs at both G1 and G2 checkpoints. Because EBNA2 is invariably expressed in proliferating Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells, the results presented here also suggest that it can impair the GADD34-mediated cellular stress response pathway by sequestering hSNF5/INI1. In so doing, EBNA2 may have the dual roles of altering the normal cellular transcription program and of imparting a survival advantage to latently infected B lymphocytes undergoing cellular stress. GADD34 1is a growtharrest and DNA damage-inducible gene (1Fornace A.J., Jr. Alamo I., Jr. Hollander M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8800-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), whose level of transcript is increased in response to a variety of agents that elicit genomic damage and apoptosis (2Hollander M.C.

Woodworth C. Fornace A.J., Jr. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 96: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as well as by amino acid deprivation and by agents that lead to protein malfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (4Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of GADD34 has been shown to be independent of functional p53 (2Hollander M.C. Zhan Q. Bae I. Fornace A.J., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13731-13737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). At its carboxyl terminus, GADD34 harbors a highly conserved domain homologous to ICP34.5 of HSV1, a virulence factor that blocks the premature shut off of protein synthesis in HSV1-infected neuroblastoma cells and may interfere with apoptosis (5Chou J. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3266-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 6Cassady K.A. Gross M. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7005-7011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the homologous domain of murine GADD34 (MyD116) can supply the anti-apoptotic functions of viral ICP34.5 (7He B. Chou J. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 84-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mammalian GADD34 likely functions to facilitate both growth arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage and other cellular stresses (3Hollander M.C.

Recently both viral ICP34.5 and mammalian GADD34 proteins have been shown to regulate the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in vitro (10He B. Gross M. Roizman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20737-20743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11Connor J.H. Weiser D.C., Li, S. Hallenbeck J.M. Shenolikar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6841-6850Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). ICP34.5 coexists in a high molecular weight complex with PP1 in cellular extracts derived from HSV1-infected HeLa cells (10He B. Gross M. Roizman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20737-20743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Mutations in either ICP34.5 or GADD34 which disrupt their binding to PP1 also impair PP1 activity and the protein malfolding response (4Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 12Cheng G. Gross M. Brett M.E. He B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3666-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the translational elongation factor eIF2α is a likely biological substrate for PP1 (10He B. Gross M. Roizman B. J. Biol.

Kuhen K.L. George C.X. Ortega L.G. Rende-Fournier R. Tanaka H. Int. J. Hematol. 1997; 65: 227-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also phosphorylated by the stress-induced kinases PERK (PKR-related ER-kinase) (14Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar, 15Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol.

Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in cells undergoing stress from protein malfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum or from amino acid deprivation. Phosphorylation of eIF2α interferes with the formation of the translational preinitiation complex by binding to and inhibiting eIF2B (17Clemens M.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 19: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); however, phosphorylated eIF2α paradoxically enhances the translation of the activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4), which, in turn, is necessary for the induction of stress-inducible gene CHOP (also known asGADD153) and other stress-responsive genes (15Harding H.P.

Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal catalytic domain (NTD) of the RSKs is most similar to p70 ribosomal S6 kinases followed by members of the protein kinase B and protein kinase C families. All of these enzymes, including the RSK NTDs, require PDK1 phosphorylation of a conserved serine (Ser227 in RSK2) in the activation loop for activity (5Jensen C.J. Buch M.B. Krag T.O.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The NTD once activated is functional for phosphorylation of several physiologic substrates (1Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), perhaps best demonstrated by the ability of a constitutively active form of RSK, containing only the NTD, to induce metaphase arrest in cleaving Xenopus embryos (7Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).The RSK CTD evaluated together with the adjacent COOH terminus is most similar in a standard BLAST search to CaM-activated protein kinases I and II. However, features in the activation loop and the COOH terminus reveal its functional relationship to the single domain MAPKAP kinases 3MAPKAP kinase is used to refer collectively to the MAPK-activated protein kinases (RSKs, MSKs, MNKs, and MAPKAP kinase 2, 3, and 5), just as in current usage MAPK is used collectively for the ERKs, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, and p38 MAPK enzymes. 3MAPKAP kinase is used to refer collectively to the MAPK-activated protein kinases (RSKs, MSKs, MNKs, and MAPKAP kinase 2, 3, and 5), just as in current usage MAPK is used collectively for the ERKs, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, and p38 MAPK enzymes. such as the MNKs (8Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) and MAPKAP kinase 2 (9Stokoe D. Engel K. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The RSK and MSK CTDs and the single domain MAPKAP kinases have a threonine residue followed by proline in the kinase activation loop, nine and eight residues from the APE motif. None of the calmodulin-activated protein kinases have threonine followed by proline at this position, a necessary feature for MAPK phosphorylation. Similarly, all of the MAPKAP kinases have a MAPK docking motif in the COOH terminus (10Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) that we believe to be similar in structural disposition to the calmodulin-binding domain encompassing the αR2 helix in CaM kinase I (11Goldberg J. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 84: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Similar to other MAPKAP kinases, the CTD is activated by MAPK via phosphorylation of a conserved T-P site in its activation loop (12Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), facilitated by the MAPK docking motif (10Smith J.A. Poteet-Smith C.E. Malarkey K. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The CTD phosphorylates one known substrate, a conserved Ser (Ser386 in RSK2) (12Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) in the linker domain that joins the NTD and the CTD. The majority of this linker corresponds to the carboxyl terminus of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase by alignment and thus belongs to the NTD by inference. Within it are several regulatory sites of phosphorylation that correspond to phosphorylation sites in p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, protein kinase B, and protein kinase C enzymes.Activation of the RSK NTD is dependent on phosphorylation of the regulatory sites in the linker domain (Ser386 and putative MAPK sites Thr365 and Ser369). Ser369 and Ser386 may be the most important of these because S369A- and S386A-type mutants of full-length RSK are virtually inactive and unresponsive to agonist stimulation (6Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 12Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), whereas T365A-type mutants are nearly wild type (12Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Ser386 lies within a docking motif for PDK1, and Ser386 phosphorylation is required for PDK1 binding and subsequent activation of the NTD (6Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The role of Ser369phosphorylation is unknown. Ser369 is not significantly phosphorylated in truncated RSK2 (amino acids 1–389), which has significant constitutive activity, suggesting that Ser369phosphorylation plays a role in the regulation of full-length RSK. Some conformational states of inactive full-length RSK may sterically inhibit NTD activity independent of Ser227 phosphorylation in the P-loop because a portion of RSK1 is phosphorylated basally at this site, yet is inactive (12Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 13Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser369, and possibly Ser386 as well, may contribute to relief of this inhibition in full-length RSK. The Ser369 kinase(s) are U0126-inhibitable (14Richards S.A. Dreisbach V.C. Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7470-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), pointing to ERKs1–2 or ERK5 as the upstream kinases for Ser369phosphorylation in vivo. Also consistent with this conclusion, phosphorylation of the equivalent serine in avian RSK1 is blocked by deletion of the MAPK docking motif (14Richards S.A. Dreisbach V.C. Murphy L.O. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7470-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, ERKs are the likely physiologic Ser369 kinases.Presently there are multiple models for RSK activation, possibly because of the existence of a multiplicity of activation mechanisms for this key signaling protein. One current model for RSK activation is vectorial (6Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In this model, MAPK activates the CTD, which in turn phosphorylates Ser386 in cis, creating a binding site for PDK1, which in turn phosphorylates Ser227, activating the NTD. However, some evidence suggests that NTD activation may not always proceed vectorially from CTD activation. A portion of Ser222 in RSK1 is phosphorylated basally (12Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) as already mentioned, obviating the requirement for PDK1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, myristoylated avian RSK1 targeted to the plasma membrane is activated in serum-starved cells independent of evident ERK activation (15Shimamura A. Ballif B.A. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 127-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). RSK mutants rendered kinase-defective in the CTD (by mutation of the essential lysine) are still activated by growth factors but not as robustly as wild type (16Bjorbaek C. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18848-18852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).In comparison with the NTD, much less is known about the CTD. In the current view, the NTD is assumed to be the only domain of the two capable of substrate phosphorylation in trans. The properties of the activated CTD as a protein kinase have never been studied. Our results demonstrate that the isolated, MAPK-activated RSK2 CTD is functional as a protein kinase toward peptide substrates. Furthermore, the CTD but not the NTD portion of the full-length protein selectively phosphorylates the best of these peptides (RRQLFRGFSFVAK), which is referred to herein as CTDtide. This peptide substrate allowed us to probe CTD regulation independently in full-length RSK2. The RSKs1 (reviewed in Ref. 1Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) and the closely related nuclear enzymes MSK1 (2Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) and MSK2 (also known as Rsk-b (3Pierrat B. Correia J.S. Mary J.L. Tomas-Zuber M. Lesslauer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29661-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar)) are unusual among protein serine/threonine kinases because they possess two kinase domains. This feature was predicted from analysis of the first RSK cDNA after its isolation fromXenopus laevis (4Jones S.W. Erikson E. Blenis J. Maller J.L. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2021129192,"Modulation of host cellular GTPases through the injection of the effector proteins SopE2 and SptP is essential forSalmonella typhimurium to enter into non-phagocytic cells. Here we show that expression of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42 SopE2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae leads to the activation of Fus3 and Kss1 MAPKs, which operate in the mating and filamentation pathways, causing filamentous growth in haploid yeast cells. Furthermore, it promotes the activation of the cell integrity MAPK Slt2. Cdc42 activation by removal of its putative intrinsic GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), Rga1, Rga2, and Bem3, also results in the phosphorylation of Kss1, Fus3, and Slt2 MAPKs. These data support the role of these GAP proteins as negative regulators of Cdc42, confirm the modulating effect of this GTPase on the filamentation and mating pathways and point to a novel connection between Cdc42 and the cell integrity pathway. Cdc42-induced activation of Slt2 occurs in a mating and filamentation pathway-dependent manner, but it does not require the function of Rho1, which is the GTPase that operates in the cell integrity pathway. Moreover, we report that Salmonella SptP can act as a GAP for Cdc42 in S. cerevisiae, down-regulating MAPK-mediated signaling. Thus, yeast provides a useful system to study the interaction of bacterial pathogenic proteins with eukaryotic signaling pathways. Furthermore, these proteins can be used as a tool to gain insight into the mechanisms that regulate MAPK-mediated signaling in eukaryotes.

They act as molecular switches, cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state. The switch is up-regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1which enhance the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, and down-regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which increase the intrinsic rate of hydrolysis of bound GTP. Modulation of Rho-GTPases by these proteins results in reorganizations of the actin cytoskeleton during morphogenesis and cell migration (1Johnson D.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many bacterial pathogens have evolved the ability to interfere with the signaling machinery of their host cells by modulating the activity of GTPases as a strategy to develop the pathogenic process. For example,Salmonella typhimurium is able to induce its internalization into non-phagocytic host cells through the activation/inactivation of Rho-GTPases. Via a specialized protein translocation apparatus, the SPI1 type III secretion system, this bacterium directs the delivery of effector proteins that modulate Cdc42 and Rac1 activation. Two of them, the GEF protein SopE2 and the inositol phosphatase SopB, stimulate Cdc42 and/or Rac function, allowing Salmonellainternalization. The protein phosphatase with GAP activity SptP, which reverses the activation of these GTPases, facilitates cell recovery (2Galan J.E. Zhou D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1990; 10: 5977-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6Shinjo K. Koland J.G. Hart M.J. Narasimhan V. Johnson D.I. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9853-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), indicating the functional homology between these proteins from both species. In addition to controlling actin rearrangements, Cdc42 has an important function in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (1Johnson D.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). All eukaryotic cells utilize MAPK modules, which consist of a phosphorylation cascade of three conserved kinases, to transduce external signals into appropriate internal responses. The budding yeast S. cerevisiae contains several functionally distinct MAPK cascades involved in the mediation of different physiological responses (for reviews see Refs. 8Banuett F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 249-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 9Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pheromones activate the mating module, composed of Ste11 (MAPKKK), Ste7 (MAPKK), and Fus3 (MAPK), which allows fusion of the mating partners. The filamentous growth pathway, which is activated by nutrient starvation and induces foraging into agar, also uses Ste11 and Ste7 to activate Kss1 (MAPK). In the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway that mediates the osmo-adaptive response, the MAPK Hog1 is activated by the MAPKK Pbs2 onto which two activating branches converge. The MAPKKKs Ssk2 and Ssk22 operate in one branch, the promiscuous Ste11 being the MAPKKK used by the other one. The module of the cell integrity pathway is composed of the MAPKKK Bck1, the MAPKKs Mkk1 and Mkk2, and the MAPK Slt2/Mpk1. Different stimuli associated with cell surface alterations activate this pathway, which leads to an appropriate response oriented to maintaining cell wall integrity (10Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar,11de Nobel H. Ruiz C. Martin H. Morris W. Brul S. Molina M. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recently, the existence of an additional pathway, the STE vegetative growth pathway, has been proposed; this would use the same MAPK module as the filamentous growth cascade. This pathway would promote vegetative growth and cell wall integrity and would be essential in mutants defective in protein glycosylation (12Lee B.N. Elion E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12679-12684Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Cullen P.J. Schultz J. Horecka J. Stevenson B.J. Jigami Y. Sprague G.F. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1005-1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite detailed knowledge of signaling through the MAPK modules, the upstream components and mechanisms responsible for their activation remain poorly understood. Among the known upstream components, members of the Rho family of the small G proteins, such as Cdc42, have been identified as important modulators of MAPK cascades in S. cerevisiae (1Johnson D.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas Cdc24 is believed to be the sole GEF for Cdc42 (1Johnson D.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sloat B.F. Pringle J.R. Science. 1978; 200: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), three proteins have been proposed to be GAPs for Cdc42: Bem3, which has been shown to have GAP activity against Cdc42in vitro (15Bender A. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1295-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 16Zheng Y. Cerione R. Bender A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rga1/Dbm1 (17Stevenson B.J. Ferguson B., De Virgilio C., Bi, E. Pringle J.R. Ammerer G. Sprague G.F., Jr. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2949-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Chen G.C. Zheng L. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1376-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and Rga2, which is identified by its homology to Rga1 (1Johnson D.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the Cdc42 regulation of MAPK modules would be mediated by a conserved family of serine/threonine kinases that have been demonstrated to be activated by this GTPase (19Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 20Martin G.A. Bollag G. McCormick F. Abo A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1970-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). These p21-activated kinases (PAKs) function upstream from MAPKKKs, linking Cdc42/Rac GTPases to MAPK signaling. It has been proposed that Cdc42 would activate PAKs by releasing the C-terminal kinase domain from the autoinhibition carried out by the N-terminal regulatory region (21Zhao Z.S. Manser E. Chen X.Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Tu H. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 602-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This region contains a Cdc42/Rac-interactive (CRIB) domain that appears to be sufficient for the binding of Cdc42 (23Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Three members of the PAK family have been found in S. cerevisiae: Ste20, Cla4, and Skm1 (24Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 25Cvrckova F., De Virgilio C. Manser E. Pringle J.R. Nasmyth K.

Microbiol. 1997; 23: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but only Ste20 seems to play a role in MAPK-mediated signaling. In fact, Ste20 is essential for signal transmission through the mating and filamentous growth and in the Ste11-mediated branch of the HOG pathways (24Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 27Mosch H.U. Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similarly, Cdc42 has been shown to play a role in activating the MAPK module that operates in the filamentous growth pathway (27Mosch H.U. Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5352-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and to function in the Ste11 branch of the HOG pathway (28Raitt D.C. Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4623-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29Reiser V. Salah S.M. Ammerer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cdc42 also influences signaling in the mating pathway, although the functional relevance of the Cdc42-Ste20 interaction is more controversial (1Johnson D.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Moskow J.J. Gladfelter A.S. Lamson R.E. Pryciak P.M. Lew D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7559-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Finally, although the scheme of sequential activation of Cdc42, Rac, and Rho in mammals has led several authors to describe a hypothetical cascade in which Bud1 would control Cdc42, and this GTPase could control Rho1 (31Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), there is no evidence for a role of Cdc42 in activation of the Rho1-mediated cell integrity pathway. To further examine the role of Cdc42 in signaling to the different MAPK pathways, here we studied the consequences of Cdc42 activation on MAPK phosphorylation, both by expressing S. typhimurium proteins that regulate Cdc42 in mammalian cells and by removing the S. cerevisiae potential Cdc42-negative regulators Rga1, Rga2, and Bem3. We observed that Cdc42 influences the activation status of the MAPKs operating in the mating, filamentation, and cell integrity pathways. Our data also indicate that S. cerevisiae is a valuable model for studying pathogenic bacterial proteins that influence eukaryotic signaling by acting on Cdc42. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in TableI. The S. typhimuriumC53 strain used in this study was kindly provided by F. Norce. Standard procedures were employed for yeast genetic manipulations (32Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar).STE20, STE7, FUS3, and KSS1were disrupted or deleted using plasmids p34S2U (26Martin H. Mendoza A. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M.

For strain YTX35, SLT2 was disrupted with LEU2 as described previously (36Navarro-Garcı́a F. Sánchez M. Pla J. Nombela C. Mol. Cell.

The plasmids used in this study were as follows: pKGSOPE2, pKGSPTP, and pKGSPGAP, expressing GST-SopE2, GST-SptP, and GST-SptPΔC (residues 1–338) fusion proteins, were constructed by PCR amplification from thesopE2 and sptP open reading frames fromS. typhimurium C53 genomic DNA, using oligonucleotides U-SOPE2 (5′-CCGGATCCGTGACTAACATAACACTATC-3′) and L-SOPE2 (5′-CCAAGCTTTCAGGACCGATTCTGAAG-3′), U-SPTP (5′-CCGGATCCATGCTAAAGTATGAGGAG-3′) and L-SPTP (5′-CCAAGCTTCAGCTTGCCGTCGTC-3′), and U-SPTP and L-SPGAP (5′-CCAAGCTTTCAAGAGTTAACGTATTCAC-3′), cleavage withBamHI-HindIII, and cloning in the correct orientation into the corresponding site of pEG(KG) (URA3 GAL1-GST leu2-d 2μ) (39Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Amplified DNA was verified by DNA sequencing. YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) broth or agar was the complete medium used for growing the yeast strains. Synthetic minimal medium (SD) contained 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and 2% glucose and was supplemented with appropriate amino acids and nucleic acid bases (32Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). SG and SR were SD with 2% galactose or raffinose, respectively, instead of glucose. Where indicated,d-sorbitol was added to the media at a final concentration of 1 m. Galactose induction experiments in liquid media were performed by growing cells in SR minimal medium to log phase and then adding galactose to 2% for 8 h. Samples were observed under an Olympus BH-2 microscope connected to a Panasonic WV-CL310 video camera. For scanning electron microscopy, cells were prepared essentially as described in a previous study (40Williams S. Veldkamp C. Trans. Br. Mycol. 1974; 63: 409-412Google Scholar) and visualized using a JEOL JSM-6400 microscope. The procedures employed in yeast cell growth, collection, and lysis, collection of proteins, fractionation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes have been previously described (41Martin H. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (New England Biolabs) was used to detect dually phosphorylated Slt2, Kss1, and Fus3 MAPKs. Slt2 protein was detected using an anti-GST-Slt2 antibody (42Martin H. Arroyo J. Sanchez M. Molina M. Nombela C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins, Fus3 and Kss1, were detected with anti-GST, anti-Fus3, and anti-Kss1 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). We wished to test whether S. cerevisiae could be used as a model system to gain insight into the role of the previously described S. typhimurium Cdc42-modulating proteins SopE2 and SptP. To this end, we first transformed the yeast wild-type strains SY2002, YPH499, and 1783 with the multicopy GAL1-inducible expression plasmid pKG-SopE2 to overexpress this protein fused to GST at the N terminus. As a first step, transformants were assayed for growth phenotypes under inducing and non-inducing conditions. All transformants were able to grow at similar rates when growing on solid glucose-based medium. However, in contrast to cells carrying the empty vector, transformants bearing pKG-SopE2 were not able to form colonies on galactose plates; only transformants from the SY2002 strain displayed a reduced growth on this medium (Fig.1A). Therefore, the expression of GST-SopE2 confers a severe inhibitory growth phenotype in yeast cells. Microscopic observation of yeast haploid cells of strain SY2002 overproducing SopE2 revealed elongated cell morphologies and the formation of chains of cells (Fig. 1B) similar to the pseudohyphal growth displayed by diploid cells under conditions of nitrogen starvation. Therefore, although SopE2 expression eventually leads to cell growth inhibition, in the SY2002 strain, in which this growth phenotype is less intense, SopE2 overexpression promotes pseudohyphal differentiation. This suggests the existence of a stimulatory effect of this Salmonella protein on the filamentous growth pathway. The differences in the intensity of the phenotype among strains could be due to a different level of GAL1-inducible expression from plasmid pKG-SopE2 in each strain. To test this possibility, extracts from the wild-type strains SY2002, YPH499, and 1783 expressing GST or GST-SopE2 were analyzed by immunoblotting, using anti-GST antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C, the bands corresponding to GST and GST-SopE2 are weaker in the extracts from strain SY2002 than in those from the other strains. Thus, the lower expression of theGAL1 promoter in this strain could account for the less intense growth phenotype observed. Cdc42 is a potent regulator of filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae (27Mosch H.U. Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5352-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Therefore, the pseudofilamentation phenotype suggests that SopE2 effectively targets Cdc42. Because Kss1 is the MAPK that operates in the filamentation pathway, if SopE2 activates Cdc42, then the expression of this bacterial protein should lead to Kss1 activation. To investigate the activation status of Kss1 we used a commercial antibody raised against dually phosphorylated (Thr202/Tyr204)-p44/42 MAPK as a tool to monitor the phosphorylation level of Kss1 and hence its activation. As shown in Fig. 2, whereas extracts from the wild-type strain SY2002 expressing GST elicited a weak immunoreactive band at the expected mobility for Kss1 (∼43 kDa), the expression of GST-SopE2 resulted in a strong increase in the intensity of this band. This band was confirmed to be Kss1 (see Fig.4F). We next disrupted STE7, the gene encoding the MAPKK of the filamentous growth pathway responsible for Kss1 activation. As expected, this band was absent in ste7mutants (Fig. 2). Furthermore, disruption of STE7 prevented GST-SopE2-induced filament formation and partially restored cell growth (not shown).Figure 4Signal transduction across pheromone response and filamentous growth pathways is necessary for Cdc42-GAP mutant-induced Slt2 activation. Effect on MAPK activation of the elimination of Ste20 (A), Ste7 (B), Fus3 (C), Kss1 (D), and both Fus3 and Kss1 (E) in double and triple Cdc42-GAP mutants.

Immunoblot analysis was performed as in Fig. 2. rga1, rga2, andbem3 are indicated as 1, 2, and3, respectively. F, verification of the identity of the phospho-MAPKs revealed with the anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibodies using anti-Slt2, anti-Kss1, and anti-Fus3 antibodies for immunodetection of the corresponding proteins in cell extracts from the isogenic strains YGS56 (rga2 bem3), YTX35 (rga2 bem3 slt2), YTX32 (rga2 bem3 fus3), and YTX28 (rga2 bem3 kss1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These Western blotting experiments also revealed that SopE2 expression resulted in the appearance of a weak ∼40-kDa immunoreactive band (Fig. 2) at the expected mobility of Fus3. This band was confirmed to be Fus3 (see Fig. 4F). Elimination of the MAPKK Ste7, which also phosphorylates Fus3 in the mating pathway, led to the disappearance of this band (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results indicate that the expression of SopE2 stimulates signaling through the filamentation and mating pathways, resulting in a strong and a weak activation of Kss1 and Fus3, respectively. Kss1 activation is probably responsible for the filamentation phenotype displayed by cells overexpressing GST-SopE2. Furthermore, the results strongly suggest that SopE2 displays GEF activity against Cdc42, functioning in a similar way in both mammalian and yeast systems. Interestingly, these experiments also showed that SopE2 overexpression results in the appearance of an ∼62-kDa immunoreactive band (Fig. 2) that corresponds to the MAPK Slt2 (41Martin H. Rodriguez-Pachon J.M. Ruiz C. Nombela C. Molina M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1511-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4F). These observations indicate that the expression of SopE2 also results in the activation of the cell integrity pathway. It has been previously reported that mating pheromone stimulates Slt2 activation, and signal transduction through the mating pathway has been shown to be necessary for this activation (43Buehrer B.M. Errede B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6517-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, SopE2-induced activation of the cell integrity pathway might also occur subsequent to the activation of the mating or filamentation pathways. However, as is evident from Fig.2, Slt2 activation was independent of the presence of Ste7. Two feasible possibilities were suggested. First, Slt2 activation could be a consequence of the direct effect of SopE2 on Rho1, the Rho-GTPase that operates in the cell integrity pathway. Second, Cdc42 could be acting on Rho1 in a mating/filamentation pathway-independent manner. It is also not possible to rule out the simultaneous function of these two mechanisms. To distinguish between these possibilities and in general to gain insight into the role of Cdc42 on MAPK-mediated signaling, further experimentation was carried out. To investigate these aspects, we next studied the morphology and MAPK signaling in yeast cells expressing activated Cdc42. To this end, we analyzed the effect of the lack of the different potential GAPs for Cdc42: Rga1, Rga2, and Bem3. Because Cdc42 plays a key role in controlling cell morphogenesis, we first examined the cell morphology of the different rga1, rga2, andbem3 mutants (Fig.3A). Consistent with previous data (17Stevenson B.J. Ferguson B., De Virgilio C., Bi, E. Pringle J.R. Ammerer G. Sprague G.F., Jr. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2949-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), microscopic examination of rga1 cells revealed an elongated morphology. Whereas rga2 mutants appeared normal, double rga1 rga2 cells showed the same phenotype as singlerga1 cells. In contrast with the data from previous studies (16Zheng Y. Cerione R. Bender A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2369-2372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) bem3 mutants displayed buds that were elongated. Simultaneous lack of Rga1 and Bem3 resulted in a combined phenotype. Triple rga1 rga2 bem3 showed the most intense morphological alterations, with 98% of the cells displaying irregular, elongated, and misshapen cells. To address the issue of whether this phenotype was a consequence of increased signaling through the mating or filamentous growth pathways, STE7 was disrupted in the triplerga1 rga2 bem3 mutant and the resulting phenotype was observed microscopically. Deletion ofSTE7 in this strain resulted in the appearance of a normal morphology"

In this study, the genomic DNA has been cloned and found to encode a precursor protein with 246 amino acids (M r = ∼27,500) containing three isoinhibitor domains (BI-III, -VI, and -VII) that are 93% identical to one another in amino acid sequences. The gene structure indicated that these isoinhibitors are produced by removal of the N-terminal pre-peptide (19 residues), 3 interchain peptides (each 5 residues), 2 interdomain peptides (each 19 residues), and the C-terminal pro-peptide (18 residues). Moreover, all the amino acid sequences of bromelain isoinhibitors could be explained by removal of one or two amino acids from BI-III, -VI, and -VII with exopeptidases. A recombinant single-chain BI-VI with and without the interchain peptide showed the same and no bromelain inhibitory activity as compared with the native BI-VI, respectively. These results indicate that the interchain peptide plays an important role of the folding process of the mature isoinhibitors.

Their properties have been extensively studied, including their nucleotide and amino acid sequences and three-dimensional structures. Reddy et al. (2Reddy M.N. Keim P.S. Heinrikson R.L. Kézdy F.J.

Keim P.S. Heinrikson R.L. Kézdy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1741-1750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each isoform of BI consists of a light chain (10 or 11 residues) and a heavy chain (40 or 41 residues) that are cross-linked with disulfide bonds (2Reddy M.N. Keim P.S. Heinrikson R.L. Kézdy F.J. J.

The three-dimensional solution structure of the sixth isoinhibitor (BI-VIN) has two distinct domains named A and B domains, each of which is formed by a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (5Hatano K. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1996; B72: 104-107Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar,6Hatano K. Kojima M. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5379-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The B domain consists of the light chain and part of the heavy chain (Glu1H-Asp9H and Leu31H-Lys41H) 2The residues in the light and heavy chains of BI are shown with superscript L and H, respectively. and was indicated to involve the major bromelain inhibitory site, possessing a more flexible structure that seems to allow the inhibitor to fit well into the catalytic site region of a target proteinase (4Hatano K. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,6Hatano K. Kojima M. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5379-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the structure of the A domain (Thr10H-Ile29H) was well converged and, thus, thought to contribute greatly to the conformational stability of the B domain (6Hatano K. Kojima M. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5379-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). BI has no similarity to the cystatin superfamily inhibitors in the primary structure (1Barrett A.J. Fritz H. Grubb A. Isemura S. Järvinen M. Katunuma N. Machleidt W. Müller-Esterl W. Sasaki M. Turk V. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 312Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and has no Gln-X-Val-X-Gly sequence that is essential for activity against papain and other cysteine proteinases (7Auerswald A. Genenger G. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Machleidt W. Engh R.A. Fritz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, the structure of BI-VIN shows no homology with that of rice cystatin that consists of an α-helix and a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (8Nagata K. Kudo N. Abe K. Arai S. Tanokura M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14753-14760Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BI-VIN shared the same folding and disulfide bond connectivities with Bowman-Birk serine proteinase inhibitor (BBI) from soybean (6Hatano K. Kojima M. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5379-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a 71-residue inhibitor that has two independent inhibitory sites toward the serine proteinases trypsin and chymotrypsin (9Harry J.B. Steiner R.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Indeed, BI-VIN shows a relatively weak inhibitory activity against these serine proteinases (6Hatano K. Kojima M. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5379-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The structural similarity of BI-VIN to BBI indicates that BI and BBI have evolved from a common ancestor and differentiated in function during the course of molecular evolution. In the present study, we isolated the genomic DNA encoding a precursor protein of BI (BIP) from pineapple leaf and sequenced it to elucidate the molecular evolution and functional expression of the two-chain inhibitor BI. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that three 6-kDa BI isoforms are produced from the 27.5-kDa BIPby proteolytic processing. To clarify the function of a 5-residue peptide that is revealed to exist between the light and heavy chains of BIP, we expressed and characterized two types of recombinant single-chain BI-VI with and without the peptide, BI-VIR and BI-VIr, respectively. Furthermore, we proposed a model mechanism of the putative processing from BIP to the mature isoinhibitors (Fig. 8). Pineapple was purchased from a local market. The oligonucleotides were obtained from ESPEC Oligo Service (Tsukuba, Japan), and restriction enzymes were obtained from Takara (Kyoto, Japan). All other reagents used were of the highest grade commercially available. Pineapple genomic DNA was isolated essentially as described previously (10Dellaporta S.L. Wood J. Hicks J.B. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 1: 19-23Crossref Scopus (6355) Google Scholar, 11Zhu H., Qu, F. Zhu L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5279-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The leaf was immersed in a solution containing 1 n NaOH and 0.5n Na2CO3 for 15 min to remove the silicon-containing cuticle, rinsed with water, and dried on paper. Five grams of the leaf were cut into small pieces and ground with liquid nitrogen. The resulting fine powder was gently resuspended in 40 ml of a proteinase buffer containing 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, 1.5% (w/v) SDS, 200 μg/ml proteinase K, and 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone. The mixture was incubated with gentle agitation at 37 °C for 2 h. Eight milliliters of 5 m potassium acetate (pH 4.8) was added to this mixture. The mixture was then incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 40,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. After adding 0.7 volume of isopropanol, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, washed in ice-cold ethanol, and dried at room temperature. The DNA obtained was then resuspended in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h after the addition of ribonuclease A. The DNA was purified using a Qiagen tip-100 column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Two degenerate primers were designed to amplify a BI-specific probe by PCR: primer BIP1, 5′-GA(A/G)GA(A/G)TA(C/T)AA(A/G)TG(C/T)TA(C/T)TG-3′, and primer BIP2, 5′-CA(A/G/T)AT(A/G)TA(C/T)TTICC(A/G)AA(C/T)TC-3′. Primers BIP1 and BIP2 correspond to the sense sequence of Glu1H-Glu-Tyr-Lys-Cys-Tyr-Cys7H and the antisense sequence of Glu24H-Phe-Gly-Lys-Tyr-Ile-Cys30H of BI-VIN, respectively (5Hatano K. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1996; B72: 104-107Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out using a Gene-Amp PCR System 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a reaction mixture containing 300 ng of the genomic DNA and 100 μmof each primer with 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing of the primers at 40 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The amplified DNA was subcloned into the pCRII using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and sequenced by the dideoxy method (12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) using a Thermo Sequenase fluorescent-labeled primer cycle sequencing kit with 7-deaza-dGTP (Amersham Biosciences) and a Shimadzu DSQ-1000 DNA sequencer (Kyoto, Japan) to confirm the coding of the partial sequence of BI. This DNA was labeled with fluorescein-12-dUTP by random hexamer primers using the Renaissance random primer fluorescein labeling kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and used as a BI-specific probe in both Southern blot analysis and plaque hybridization. The genomic DNA (1.5 μg) was digested with EcoRI, XbaI, and SphI. The digests were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.9% agarose gel, denatured, and finally fixed to a nylon membrane BiodyneA (Pall Bio Support, East Hills, NY) according to the method of Southern (13Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21473) Google Scholar). The blot was hybridized with the fluorescein-labeled probe at 55 °C and subsequently detected by the specific antibody-mediated chemiluminescence reaction using nucleic acid chemiluminescence reagent according to the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A pineapple genomic library was constructed using EcoRI-digested 5–10-kbp DNA and a λZAPII phage vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting vector was packaged into bacteriophage particles with Gigapack Gold packaging extract and grown on Escherichia coli (E. coli) XL-1 Blue MRF′ cells (Stratagene). The library was plated in 10 Petri dishes (a total of 1.2 × 105 recombinant clones), transferred to BiodyneA, and finally, hybridized at 65 °C with the BI-specific probe. After three rounds of screening, the genomic DNA inserts of the positive clones were subcloned by in vivo excision into pBluescriptII SK− (Stratagene). The double-stranded DNA in the phagemid was restriction-mapped and sequenced as described above. The DNA sequence encoding BI-VIR was amplified from the pineapple genomic DNA by PCR using two oligonucleotides as primers, the forward primer BIR1, 5′-CGA TCC ATG GCT ACC GCT TGC TCC GAA TGC GTT TGT CCG CTG CGA-3′, designed to contain an NcoI site and additional Met and Ala codons, and the reverse primer BIR2, 5′-GCC AAG CTT TCA TCA TTT TAC GCA ATC GTT GG-3′, designed to contain an additional stop codon and a HindIII site. The PCR products were digested with NcoI andHindIII and were ligated into an expression vector of pET32a without any thioredoxin-coding gene and Factor-Xa site. The resulting plasmid (pET32′-BI-VIR) encodes the His tag, enterokinase recognition site, and BI-VIR gene in this order. The expression vector for BI-VIr(pET32′-BI-VIr) was constructed from a pET32′-BI-VIR plasmid using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide primers were used to delete the interchain peptide sequence coding region as follows: primer BIr1, 5′-GAA TGC GTG TGT CCG CTG CGA GAA GAG TAC AAA TGC TAC TGC-3′ and primer BIr2, 5′-GCA GTA GCA TTT GTA CTC TTC TCG CAG CGG ACA CAC GCA TTC-3′. The DNA sequences were confirmed as described above. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the pET32′-BI-VIR or pET32′-BI-VIr (14Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 185: 60-89Crossref Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in a 10 ml of LB medium containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C. The production of BI-VIR or BI-VIrwas induced at an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6 by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 1 mm. After induction at 26.5 °C for 16 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 0.5% (w/v) NaCl, and stored at −80 °C. The frozen cells were resuspended in a binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) containing 0.1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and lysed by ultrasonication. The soluble fraction was separated from the insoluble by centrifugation (40,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min), and the supernatant was added to a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with the binding buffer. After washing with the buffer, the sample was eluted with an elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8.0, 300 mmNaCl, and 300 mm imidazole), dialyzed against a 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer (buffer A at pH 7.5), and applied to a Mono-Q 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. The sample was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 mNaCl in buffer A and pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centriprep-3 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The His-tag region was removed using the Enterokinase Max according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The resulting sample was applied to a RESOURCE RPC column (AmershamBiosciences) and equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid containing 1% (v/v) acetonitrile using an ÄKTAexplorer 10S (Amersham Biosciences). Elution was achieved with a linear gradient of 1–50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The purity and identification of the sample were checked by Tricine SDS-PAGE (15Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10481) Google Scholar) without dithiothreitol and MALDI-TOF MS using a Voyager DE-STR (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). CD spectra were obtained at room temperature with a Jasco J-700 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo). The samples were dissolved into a concentration of 30 μm in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and adjusted to pH 4.6. The path length of the quartz cell was 0.1 cm. Eight scans were accumulated at a speed of 50 nm/min with 0.2-nm increments. The spectra thus obtained were submitted to a noise reduction procedure and expressed in terms of mean residue ellipticity [θ] in degree·cm2·dmol−1. The protein concentration of BI-VI was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 5,720m−1 cm−1. The inhibitory activities of BI-VIR, BI-VIr, and BI-VIN were measured as described previously (16Heinrikson R.L. Kézdy F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. To determine their kinetics, 50 μl of stem bromelain (final concentration of 0.5 μm) and 50 μl of various concentrations of the sample (28–213 nm for BI-VIR and 12–195 nm for BI-VIN) were mixed and incubated in 3 ml of a 20 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.6) containing 100 mm KCl and 1 mmdithiothreitol at 25 °C for 3 min. Then 50 μl ofp-nitrophenylbenzyloxycarbonyl-l-lysinate (CLN) in 90% (v/v) acetonitrile was added to obtain a final concentration of 24 and 40 μm. The increase of absorbance at 317 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer at 25 °C. The initial velocities (v 0) were calculated from the increase of absorbance at 317 nm/min. The inhibition constant (K i ) values were calculated by a Dixon plot analysis (17Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of BI-VI was estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 5,720m−1 cm−1. The pH dependence of the bromelain inhibitory activity of BI-VIR and BI-VIN was investigated in a solution of 50 mm buffer, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol over the pH range of 2.5–8.0. Buffers used were glycine-Cl (pH 2.5–3.0), citrate (pH 3.0–6.0), and sodium phosphate (pH 6.0–8.0). The inhibitor (final concentration of 16 nm) and the enzyme (6.3 nm) were mixed in the appropriate buffer and incubated for 3 min at 25 °C. The residual enzyme activity was determined by the addition of CLN (20 μm) and measurement of the v 0with/without the inhibitor. The percent inhibition toward bromelain is given by [1 – (v 0 with inhibitor)/(v 0 without inhibitor)] × 100. The PCR fragment, amplified from pineapple genomic DNA using two degenerate primers, contained the sequences of the light and heavy chains of BI. Genomic DNA from pineapple leaf was probed with this PCR fragment. In each restriction enzyme digestion, the probe hybridized to one high molecular weight fragment (Fig. 1). The Southern analysis suggested that the EcoRI fragment of the genomic DNA contained the full-length of the coding region of BIP. Therefore, the genomic mini-library was constructed from 5 to 10 kbp of EcoRI fragments using λZAPII. Three positive phage clones were obtained after screening of 1.2 × 105 plaques using the PCR fragment as a probe, subcloned into pBluescriptII SK−, and named pBI-1, -2, and -3. These clones showed the same cleavage profiles upon restriction map analysis. The restriction map and sequencing strategy of the pBI-1 are shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2Restriction map of λBI-1 and summary of the sequencing strategy.The arrows indicate directions and extents of nucleotide sequencing of restriction fragments. The solid bar in theEcoRI fragment indicates the open reading frame. Restriction sites are indicated as follows: E, EcoT22I;P, PshBI; T, PstI;S, SphI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nucleotide sequence for anSphI-PstI digest of the pBI-1 contained the full length of the structural gene of BIP as well as untranslated 5′-upstream and 3′-downstream regions (Fig.3). Although the beginning of the open reading frame (ORF) contained two putative initiation codons, software analyses using the program ORF Finder (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and Gene Scan (18Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3072) Google Scholar) suggested that the first ATG (position 1–3) was a real initiator. Assuming this codon to be the initiator, the ORF was 738 bp long and encoded a protein of 246 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 27.5 kDa. The potential TATA box and polyadenylation signals were found at positions −97 to −90 and 839 to 844 from the beginning of the ORF, respectively. Three putative CCAAT boxes, 2 of which lie on palindrome structures (Fig. 3), were also found at positions −189 to −186, −120 to −117, and −113 to −110. The T at position −67 was suggested as the initiation point of the transcription by the program Promoter Prediction (19Reese M.G. Harris N.L. Eeckman F.H. Hunter L. Klein T.E. Biocomputing '96: Proceedings of the 1996 Pacific Symposium, Hawaii, January 3–6, 1996. World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore1996: 737-738Google Scholar). The TATA box was, thus, located at 23 bp upstream from the transcriptional start, which is within the normal distance (from −25 to −30 bp). The deduced amino acid sequence of the ORF contained three BI sequences, BI-VII (Thr20-Lys76), BI-III (Thr96-Lys152), and BI-VI (Thr172-Lys228), as shown in Fig. 3. The predicted sequences of these isoinhibitors showed complete agreement with those determined by conventional protein sequencing (4Hatano K. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As a result, BIP had four kinds of extra peptide sequences that are not contained in the mature BI (Fig. 3), (i) an N-terminal pre-peptide sequence after the initiation codon (Met1-Leu19), (ii) three identical interchain peptide sequences between the light and heavy chains in individual isoforms (Thr31-Asp35, Thr107-Asp111, and Thr183-Asp187, respectively), (iii) two interdomain peptide sequences with high homology to each other (Pro77-Leu95 and Pro153-Leu171, respectively), and (iv) a C-terminal pro-peptide sequence reaching the translational stop codon (Pro229-Leu246). The nucleotide sequences of the interchain and interdomain peptides were not intron sequences, since the consensus sequences of intron-exon junctions on plant genes (20Brown J.W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 9549-9559Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) were not found in the DNA sequence of BIP. The BI-VIR and BI-VIrconstructs (Fig. 4 A) were expressed in the soluble fraction of the cell lysate and purified by three chromatography applications to give a single band on Tricine SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, the purity of the sample was estimated to be more than 95% by MALDI-TOF MS (data not shown). It was also confirmed by the MS analysis that BI-VIR contained an additional peptide, Ala-Met-Ala, derived from the cloning vector and the interchain peptide, and BI-VIr contained the Ala-Met-Ala peptide. The overall yields of BI-VIR and BI-VIr were ∼6 and 3 mg/l of bacterial culture, respectively. As shown in Fig.5, the obtained CD spectra were analyzed with the program CONTIN (21Provencher S.W. Glockner G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) to estimate the relative amount of each secondary structure element. The results indicated that BI-VIR and BI-VIr are rich in β-sheets (about 40%) and have almost the same secondary structure as that of BI-VIN (Table I). All the CD spectra exhibited a minimum near 200 nm and a maximum near 230 nm (Fig.5). Interestingly, the spectra of BI-VIr showed a slight decrease in the ellipticity near 230 nm in comparison with those of the other proteins.Table ISecondary structure contents (%) estimated from the CD spectraBI-VI typeα Helix (%)β Strand (%)β Turn (%)Remainder (%)BI-VIN8442622BI-VIR8363026BI-VIr10481825 Open table in a new tab The Dixon-plot experiments of BI-VIR and BI-VIN indicated that they competitively inhibited the bromelain-catalyzed hydrolysis of CLN (Fig.6). The obtained K i values toward bromelain were 314 ± 12 nm for BI-VIR and 273 ± 3 nm for BI-VIN (Table II). This indicates that the inhibitory activity of BI-VI is not changed so much by scission and removal of the interchain peptide. However, BI-VIr without the interchain peptide showed no inhibitory activity toward bromelain.Table IIInhibition constants and the optimal inhibitory pH toward bromelainBI-VI type K i (n m)Optimal inhibitory pHBI-VIN273 ± 34.0BI-VIR314 ± 124.5BI-VIrNot detectedDetails of the measurement conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Details of the measurement conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The optimal inhibitory pH values of BI-VIR and BI-VIN were observed around 4.5 and 4.0, respectively (Fig. 7). BI-VIR showed inhibitory activity less than BI-VIN at any pH value examined. For instance, BI-VIN still retained about 70% inhibitory activity over the range of pH 3–5. whereas, BI-VIR had only about 30% inhibitory activity at pH 3.0. In this study, we isolated the structural gene of the BI precursor protein (BIP) from pineapple leaf. BIP was revealed to be a 27.5-kDa protein including the N-terminal pre-peptide, three isoinhibitors (BI-VII, -III, and -VI), three interchain peptides, two interdomain peptides, and the C-terminal pro-peptide (Fig. 3). In the other proteinase inhibitors composed of multiple inhibitor domains, the interdomain peptides are susceptible to cleavage by proteinases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and subtilisin (22Scott M.J. Huckaby C.S. Kato I. Kohr W.J. Laskowski M. Tsai M-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5899-5907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Vogel R. Assfalg-Machledt I. Esterl A. Machleidt W. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the interchain and interdomain peptides of BIP may be also sensitive to such proteinases in pineapple stem, and the mature isoinhibitors may be produced by posttranslational proteolysis (Fig.8). The interchain peptides might be cleaved and removed by endopeptidases, probably the target proteinase bromelain, at the Gln-Thr and Arg-Thr sites (Gln30-Thr31, Arg106-Thr107, and Arg182-Thr183; Fig. 3). The interdomain peptides and a C-terminal pro-peptide would be cleaved and removed by trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like proteinases at the Lys-Pro sites (Lys76-Pro77, Lys152-Pro153, and Lys228-Pro229; Fig. 3) and Leu-Thr sites (Leu95-Thr96 and Leu171-Thr172; Fig. 3), respectively. On the other hand, the pineapple genome contains only a single copy of the BIP gene (Fig. 1), although the eight isoinhibitors have been isolated from pineapple stem so far (4Hatano K. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, BI-III, -VI, and -VII must be modified by exopeptidases to become the other isoinhibitors. For example, BI-I and BI-II would be produced by removal of the N-terminal residues Thr1L and Glu1H of the two chains in BI-III. BI-VIII would be produced by removal of the C-terminal residue Gln11L in BI-VII (Fig. 8). We expressed the recombinant single-chain inhibitor with the interchain peptide (BI-VIR; Fig. 4 A), and BI-VIR was revealed to have almost the same inhibitory activity as the two-chain native inhibitor (Table II). Another recombinant single-chain protein without the peptide (BI-VIr; Fig. 4 A) was also expressed in E. coli; however, BI-VIr had no inhibitory activity toward bromelain (Table II). These results indicate that the interchain peptide plays an important role of the folding process of the mature isoinhibitors. Furthermore, we also constructed two additional recombinant BI-VI proteins with the pro-peptide (Thr172-Glu246; Fig. 3) and with both the interdomain peptide and pro-peptide (Pro153-Glu246; Fig. 3) by the above-mentioned method. However, these proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies, 3Y. Sawano, K. Hatano, K. Nagata, T. Muramatsu, and M. Tanokura, unpublished results. indicating that the interdomain peptide and pro-peptide would prevent the proper folding of BI-VIR, unlike the case of the interchain peptide. Interestingly, there are many conserved residues among the pre-peptide, two interdomain peptides, and pro-peptide (Fig.9). In a homology search using the databases BLAST and FASTA, no protein was found to show a high similarity (the Expect value (E) < 10) with these peptides. The CD spectra of the recombinant and native BI-VI proteins indicated that they are rich in β structures and poor in α-helix, as shown in Table I. Interestingly, BI-VIr showed a slight lower ellipticity at about 230 nm than those of BI-VIR and BI-VIN (Fig. 5). Because these proteins contain no tryptophan residues and a phenylalanine residue exhibits negligibly low CD activity at 230 nm (24Kay E. Strickland E.H. Billups C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 797-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sreerama N. Manning M.C. Powers M.E. Zhang J.X. Goldenberg D.P. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10814-10822Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the positive peak at 230 nm would mainly contribute to the transitions of the disulfide bonds and/or tyrosine residues (25Sreerama N. Manning M.C. Powers M.E. Zhang J.X. Goldenberg D.P. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10814-10822Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Especially, the wavelengths of the disulfide CD bands depend on the dihedral angle of disulfide bond (26Woody R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 34-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). For example, the transition shifts of the disulfide-CD band are observed in the region of 200–350 nm (27Adler A.J. Greenfield N.J. Fasman G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 675-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Therefore, the partial disulfide bond(s) of BI-VIr, probably near the reactive site of the B domain, would not be formed properly like those of BI-VIN so that the reactive site with localized conformational change could not fit well into the catalytic site cleft of bromelain. The optimal inhibitory pH values of BI-VIR and BI-VIN were 4.5 and 4.0, respectively, consistent with the prediction that the destination of the BIP transportation was suggested to be acidic vacuoles by the program PSORT (28Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BI-VIR showed a weaker inhibitory activity than BI-VIN at any pH point examined (Fig. 5). This indicates that the enzyme would prefer the flexible two-chain structure to the stable loop at the inhibitory site. Generally, proteinase inhibitors have an inhibitory loop region, a so-called “lock-and-key” motif (29Laskowski M., Jr. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very interesting to clarify why BI does not have such a loop for the proteinase inhibition. The C-terminal residue Arg11L or Gln11L of the B domain is assumed to be the major bromelain inhibitory site of BI-VIN (4Hatano K. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The above-mentioned processing of the interchain peptide yields two additional charges, with negative and positive around the inhibitory site. Probably the α-carboxyl group of the light chain, which is located near the inhibitory site, might be mainly involved in the bromelain inhibitory mechanism. Therefore, the protonation/deprotonation of this group may play an important role on the inhibition. In addition, this C-terminal region of the light chain could fit well into the active site cleft of the cysteine proteinase papain by computer modeling (4Hatano K. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, the significance of the two-chain structure may be the existence of such a free C-terminal α-carboxyl group that might be well accommodated in the active site cleft of the target proteinase and interact with a certain group(s) in the enzyme. BI-VI had a remarkable homology with BBI from soybean in their amino acid sequences, especially with respect to their disulfide-bond arrangements (6Hatano K. Kojima M. Tanokura M. Takahashi K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5379-5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The folding pattern of BI-VI also closely resembled that of BBI from soybean (30Werner M. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 999-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); both proteins have two distinct domains, and each domain is composed of a three-stranded β-sheet. Therefore, BI and BBI are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor and differentiated in function during the course of molecular evolution. However, the nucleotide sequence of BIP was not significantly similar to those of BBI genes (31Baek J.M. Song J.C. Choi Y.D. Kim S.I. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 32Rakwal R. Kumar Agrawal G. Jwa N.S. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Moreover, three BI isoforms are encoded on a single-copy gene (Fig. 1), whereas the BBI precursor proteins are encoded at different gene loci in soybean and rice (31Baek J.M. Song J.C. Choi Y.D. Kim S.I. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 32Rakwal R. Kumar Agrawal G. Jwa N.S. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, BI and BBI would have shared individual ancestors long ago and come to a similar protein folding and a similar function during the course of molecular evolution. BIP contained three similar inhibitor domains that share about 95% nucleotide sequence identity to one another. Such a high degree of the conservation suggests that BI would have evolved by gene duplications from a single functional isoinhibitor and formed such a multidomain-precursor protein, as well as the other multidomain proteinase inhibitors (29Laskowski M., Jr. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). In the multidomain proteinase inhibitors of plant, potato multicystatin, and serine proteinase inhibitor fromNicotiana alata (Na-PI) have been reported so far (33Waldron C. Wegrich L.M. Merlo P.A. Walsh T.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 34Atkinson A.H. Heath R.L. Simpson R.J. Clarke A.E. Anderson M.A. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 203-213PubMed Google Scholar). Potato multicystatin is a cysteine proteinase inhibitor and works as the unprocessed protein of 85 kDa, and 1 molecule can inhibit 8 molecules of papain (35Walsh T.A. Stickland J.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Na-PI is synthesized as a 42-kDa precursor protein containing 5 tandem-repeated domains, and the precursor protein is converted into the mature 6-kDa inhibitors by post-translational proteolysis of the interdomain sequences (34Atkinson A.H. Heath R.L. Simpson R.J. Clarke A.E. Anderson M.A. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 203-213PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very noteworthy that BIP is processed at the interchain sequences as well as the interdomain sequences and converted to such novel two-chain isoinhibitors. Thus we propose to call the new family of these isoinhibitors as “the bromeins” in cysteine proteinase inhibitors. The advantage of producing multiple inhibitors from a precursor protein may lie in the ability not only to generate specificities against a broad spectrum of proteinase inhibition but also to promote the efficiency to sort vacuoles by utilizing a single targeting motif for every three inhibitors. In addition, the remarkable trimerization of BI must involve unique mechanisms to achieve the correct folding and disulfide-bond formation (Fig. 8). This is raising numerous questions about molecules involved in protein folding within the plant secretory pathway. However, the resulting large decrease in solvent-accessible surface area may provide a driving force for the assembly of this novel and compact structure. The physiological function of BI is thought to regulate the coexistent proteinase activity in the cell, although the detailed function is not clear. First, BIP would be folded properly on the endoplasmic-reticulum membrane, and the pre-peptide would be removed by signal peptidases, and then the resulting precursor protein would be transported to cell organelle, probably vacuoles. Under the acidic condition of vacuoles, BI blocks the activity of bromelain and/or other proteinases and protects other proteins from their proteolysis. If animals eat pineapple plant, the situation of pH will change dramatically from acidic in the vacuoles to neutral in the mouth of the attacker. Because the bromelain activity is optimal at neutral pH (pH 5–7) and BI cannot inhibit bromelain at that pH (Fig. 7), bromelain destroys the tissue including proteins so that the animals could not eat it so much next time. We are very grateful to Dr. Makoto Nishiyama (University of Tokyo) for valuable discussions on this work."

A. 1994; 91: 7573-7577Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). InEscherichia coli, the unfolding of proteins in the cell envelope appears to be a primary stimulus that activates the ςE-dependent response (1Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol.

Previous work identified genes that are transcribed by EςE RNA polymerase. The EςE regulon controls at least two cellular processes, folding of polypeptides in the bacterial envelope and biosynthesis/transport of lipopolysaccharides (4Dartigalongue C. Missiakas D. Raina S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20866-20875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). ςEis encoded by the rpoE gene and in part regulates its own expression, as EςE RNA polymerase transcribesrpoE as well as the downstream genesrseA/B/C. Conditions that cause unfolding of polypeptides in the envelope signal the EςE response by a mechanism that requires RseA and RseB (5Collinet B. Yuzawa H. Chen T. Herrera C. Missiakas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33898-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The genes for these two regulators of EςE are located immediately downstream of rpoE. RseA is a short polypeptide that integrates into the cytoplasmic membrane. The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of RseA is known to bind ςE, whereas the C-terminal domain of RseA protrudes into the periplasm. The C-terminal domain of RseA interacts with RseB in the periplasm, a compartment that is located between the inner and outer membranes of E. coli (6De Las Peñas A. Conolly L. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 3373-3386Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 7Missiakas D. Mayer M. Lemaire M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). RseB binding to RseA increases the affinity of the RseA/RseB complex for ςE. Stresses that cause unfolding of proteins in the bacterial envelope lead to the dissociation of RseA/RseB, thereby reducing the affinity of RseA for ςE. The domain structure of sigma factors has been probed with trypsin cleavage of the peptide backbone under conditions of limited proteolysis (8Severinova E. Severinov K. Fenyo D. Marr M. Brody E.N. Roberts J.W. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ς70, the major sigma factor of E. coli RNA polymerase, is a 613-amino acid residue polypeptide with two preferred trypsin cleavage sites, suggesting that it is assembled from folded subdomains (see diagram in Fig.1). The N-terminal cleavage fragment of ς70, residues 1–114, has not yet been analyzed in depth. The central domain, ς702 (residues 104–448), is capable of associating with core RNA polymerase in a manner that allows binding of the ς702 holoenzyme to single stranded DNA oligonucleotides that encompass the promoter binding site for ς70 RNA polymerase. Despite this DNA binding activity, ς702 holoenzyme does not promote transcription in vitro. The C-terminal trypsin fragment of ς70, ς703,4(residues 449–613), binds to the coliphage T4 anti-sigma factor AsiA (9Brody E.N. Kassavetis G.A. Ouhammouch M. Sanders G.M. Tinker R.L. Geiduschek G.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Urbauer J.L. Adelman K. Urbauer R.J. Simeonov M.F. Gilmore J.M. Zolkiewski M. Brody E.N. J. Biol.

The formation of a complex between AsiA with the C-terminal domain 4.2 of ς70-(551–608) prevents the association of RNA polymerase holoenzyme with −35 promoter sequences and blocks ς70 RNA polymerase transcription during T4 coliphage infection. Rsd, the anti-sigma factor of E. coli, also binds to region 4.2, suggesting that inactivation of ς70 may occur by a similar mechanism (12Dove S.L. Hochschild A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6413-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Jishage M. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Promoters that are composed of an extended −10 binding site for ς70 RNA polymerase but lack the canonical −35 sequence can be transcribed by a truncated RNA polymerase, ς70-(1–529) (15Kumar A. Grimes B. Fujita N. Makino K. Malloch R.A. Hayward R.S. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although this has not yet been tested experimentally, ς70-(1–529) is presumably refractory to AsiA- or Rsd-mediated inhibition. By using limited trypsin digestion and peptide mapping, it is reported here that an N-terminal portion of ςE, residues 1–153, binds core RNA polymerase but not RseA. The remaining portion of ςE, residues 154–191, is homologous to region 4.2, the sigma factor binding site for promoter DNA. In order to establish the biochemical activity of the putative region 4.2, mutations that reduce transcription of EςE RNA polymerase were isolated and mapped to ςE residues 178, 181, and 183. The variant ςE proteins failed to associate with RseA. These findings suggest that binding of RseA to region 4.2 of ςE prevents transcription of EςE RNA polymerase by blocking promoter recognition. Strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Sequences of primers used in this study can be obtained from the authors upon request. When necessary, Luria Bertani (LB) medium was supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), or tetracycline (15 μg/ml). Induction ofHisRseAN and RseANHisand the various HisςE truncations or mutants was accomplished by addition of arabinose (0.2%) or isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) to cultures of E. coli LMG194 or BL21, respectively, harboring the appropriate plasmids. rpoE alleles were transduced along with the linked nadB::Tet marker to the desired background using P1 bacteriophage as described (16Miller J.

Plasmids were verified by DNA sequence analysis. In this manner, the cloned DNA fragments were fused to generate a translational fusion between a 6-histidine tag followed by a cleavable enterokinase site. To improve production yields, the DNA fragments were subcloned into pET-24d vector, using NcoI and EcoRI restriction sites. Such plasmids were transformed in strain BL21, and gene expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The histidine-tagged N-terminal RseA proteins were purified from cell extracts of E. coli strain LMG194 (pBAD-B-HisRseAN; the 6-histidine tag can be removed by enterokinase cleavage) or E. coli strain BL21 (pET-24d-RseANHis). Cells of 2L culture were harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0), and lysed in a French pressure cell at 14,000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. RseAN pelleted with the insoluble material. The protein was recovered from the pellet using buffer A containing 8m urea. This treatment solubilized the protein that could be recovered after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C to 90% homogeneity. The supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography using 1 ml of nickel-NTA resin (Qiagen). The resin was washed with buffer A supplemented with 10 mmimidazole, and RseAN with a C-terminal histidine tag was eluted using an imidazole gradient. The N-terminal tagged RseAN protein was recovered by treatment of the beads with enterokinase as indicated by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Purification of HisςE full-length and the various protein mutants and fragments was performed as described forHisςE (5Collinet B. Yuzawa H. Chen T. Herrera C. Missiakas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33898-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For affinity measurements, 50% slurry of nickel-NTA was prepared that contained bound 6-histidine-tagged proteins (RseAN, wild-type ςE, or mutant ςE or ςE fragments each at 1–2 pmol protein/μl slurry). Increasing concentrations of substrate proteins (only the 5- or 10-fold molar excess are shown in the figures) were added to a 1-ml suspension of 50 μl of nickel-NTA-Sepharose charged with bait protein in buffer A containing 0.2% octylglucoside. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant (850 μl) was removed and protein precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Sediments were washed with acetone, solubilized in 50 μl of 0.1 mTris-HCl, 4% SDS, pH 7.0, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A containing 0.2% octylglucoside. Washes were completed within 10 min, and no significant elution was observed during washes. Samples were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with anti-ςE, anti-RseA, or anti-RpoA (the α subunit of core polymerase) antibodies. Immune complexes were detected using a secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (16Miller J. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Modification of sulfhydryl groups using Ellman's reagent (dithionitrobenzoate (DTNB)) was performed at 20 °C using 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 8 μmςE protein in the presence or absence of RseAN (a 2–160 μm range of concentration was used; only the 10-fold molar excess is shown in Fig. 4). Upon addition of DTNB (250 μm) to a 1-ml reaction volume, formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate was monitored at 412 nm and quantified using the extinction coefficient value of 14150m−1cm−1 (17Riddles P. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Trypsin digestion reactions contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 200 pmol of ςE, andl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) at either a 1:200, 1:400, or 1:800 ratio of trypsin over ςE. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C and stopped by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10% trichloroacetic acid. Proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-ςE antibodies. Edman degradation and electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry measurements of trypsin digests were performed by the Rockefeller University Protein Sequencing Facility and the Mass Spectrometry Facility at the University of California, Los Angeles. We sought to probe the domain structure of the E. coli extracellular sigma factor, ςE, by trypsin cleavage. ςE protein was purified from an engineered E. coli strain that overexpressed a His-tagged variant of the sigma factor using affinity chromatography. The N-terminal histidine tag was removed by enterokinase cleavage, causing ςE elution from nickel-NTA-Sepharose. The eluate was subjected to ion exchange chromatography yielding a more than 95% pure preparation of ςE. Purified ςE is soluble and stable at 4 °C. It is capable of binding core RNA polymerase or the RseA anti-sigma factor (see below). These results suggested that our purified ςE was correctly folded and functional. Incubation of purified ςE with dilute amounts of trypsin caused peptide cuts at many different sites, generating a large spectrum of cleavage fragments. A 10-kDa fragment of ςEappeared to be resistant to cleavage by dilute amounts of trypsin (Fig.2). Nevertheless, an increase in the molar ratio of trypsin to ςE to 1/200 caused cleavage of the entire polypeptide into fragments of small sizes that eluded further analysis on SDS-PAGE. Thus, in contrast to the trypsin-resistant ς70, ςE seems sensitive to protease cleavage, suggesting a folded structure that is less compact and more accessible to protease. Electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry and Edman degradation were used to characterize the 10-kDa fragment of ςE that resisted trypsin cleavage at dilute or intermediate enzyme concentrations. The 10-kDa fragment corresponded to amino acid residues 1–91 of ςE. This portion of ςE carries a peptide with sequence homology to region 1 and region 2 of ς70 (Fig. 1). Region 2 of ς70 contains four functional subdomains, designated 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4. Homologous subdomains were also identified within ςE using BLAST homology searches (Fig. 1). Subdomain 2.1 represents the binding region for RNA polymerase core enzyme, whereas subdomain 2.3 contributes to DNA melting. The subdomain 2.4 is involved in promoter recognition in the −10 nucleotides region upstream of the transcriptional start site. The N-terminal trypsin-resistant fragment of ςE (residues 1–91) binds neither to core RNA polymerase nor to RseA (see below). Together these results indicate that, unlike ς70, trypsin cleavage of ςE does not separate folded domains with distinct function. We sought to map the binding sites of ςE for both RNA polymerase core enzyme and the anti-sigma factor RseA. N- and C-terminal truncations of ςE were generated by PCR amplification using specific primers and rpoE template DNA (rpoE encodes ςE).HisςE (amino acids 1–191),HisςE1–91,HisςE1–116,HisςE1–137,HisςE1–153, andHisςE95–191 are rpoEvariants of variable lengths bearing an N-terminal histidine tag. The subscript numbers indicate the RpoE amino acid positions at the beginning and the end of each fragment, respectively. His-tagged ςE variants were purified by affinity chromatography, and their ability to interact with either RseAN or core RNA polymerase was tested in vitro. Aliquots of nickel-NTA-Sepharose precharged with ςEprotein were dispensed as a 50% slurry into buffer containing 10-fold excess of purified E. coli core RNA polymerase.HisςE-α2ββ′ binding was measured as the amount of RNA polymerase α subunit that sedimented during 4,000 × g centrifugation with nickel-NTA-Sepharose. Full-length RpoE,HisςE, and the C-terminal truncated variantHisςE1–153, caused co-sedimentation of core RNA polymerase with ςE-charged resin (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that RpoE residues 154–191, a peptide sequence homologous to the ς70 4.2 domain involved in binding the −35 region of promoter DNA, is not required for ςE binding to RNA polymerase. As a control, mock-charged nickel-NTA-Sepharose did not associate with RNA polymerase. N-terminal truncation of the presumed binding region for core RNA polymerase, domains 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, indeed prevented the variant ςE protein (ςE95–191) to capture the α subunit of RNA polymerase. A similar result was observed for all C-terminal truncations tested, as nickel-NTA-Sepharose charged withHisςE1–91,HisςE1–116, orHisςE1–137 failed to promote co-sedimentation of RNA polymerase (Fig. 3A). RseA is a type II membrane protein with an N-terminal ςE-binding domain that resides in the cytoplasm and a C-terminal RseB-binding domain within the periplasm. RseAN is a truncated variant containing an N-terminal His tag and a C-terminal truncation to the first residue of the membrane-spanning domain of wild-type RseA. RseAN was purified from the cytoplasm of E. coli by affinity chromatography and its N-terminal His tag removed by cleavage using enterokinase. Purified RseAN was added to Ni-NTA-Sepharose pre-equilibrated with HisςE fragments and sigma factor binding was measured by immunoblotting as the amount of RseAN that sedimented with the Sepharose beads during 4,000 × g centrifugation. Only full-length RpoE,HisςE, but notHisςE1–91,HisςE1–116,HisςE1–137, orHisςE1–153, caused co-sedimentation of RseAN with the precharged resin (Fig.3B). To confirm these findings, a reciprocal experiment was conducted (Fig. 3C). Ni-NTA-Sepharose charged withHisRseAN was incubated with the ςE and its variants ςE1–91, ςE1–116, ςE1–137, ςE1–153, or ςE95–191. The His tag of each variants was removed using enterokinase, and proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography. Control experiments showed that the purified ςE variants (ςE1–91, ςE1–116, ςE1–137, ςE1–153, or ςE95–191) did not co-sediment with mock-charged nickel-NTA-Sepharose beads (Fig. 3C). Our assay could detect the binding of RseAN to full-length ςE. All C-terminal truncations of ςEabolished the association with RseAN, suggesting that C-terminal ςE sequences are required for RseA binding. Failure to observe binding between ςE95–191 and RseAN can be attributed to a lack of structure or stability of ςE95–191. Indeed when RseAN was overproduced along with ςE95–191 in the same cell, a soluble ςE95–191-RseANcomplex could be extracted from total cell extracts (data not shown). Amino acids 1–153 of ςE polypeptide (fragment ςE1–153) are sufficient to promote interaction between the sigma factor and core RNA polymerase, but fail to associate with RseAN. We entertained the possibility that interaction with RseA occurs at a C-terminal portion of ςE. rpoE codon 165 encodes cysteine, a sulfhydryl-containing amino acid, within the C-terminal peptide sequence (amino acids 154–191). Cysteine 165, Cys165, is the only cysteine residue within ςE. Reaction of Ellman's reagent (DTNB) with sulfhydryl residues results in the formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate, a product that absorbs light at 412 nm. Cys165 is accessible to Ellman's reagent because incubation of ςE with this compound led to the rapid generation (less than 30 s) of the product with absorbance at 412 nm (Fig.4). The extent of release of thionitrobenzoate did not yield a molar ratio of DTNB over ςE, as the amount of reacting thiol was 12 μm and the calculated ςE concentration was 8 μm. Either the preparation of ςE was contaminated with thiol-containing proteins or the concentration of ςE, deduced from the calculated molar extinction coefficient ε278 nm 15,400 m−1cm−1, was underestimated. Nonetheless, further incubation of this reaction did not increase the absorbance at 412 nm, a finding that is consistent with the notion that all available sulfhydryl moieties had been modified within 30 s. Incubation of Ellman's reagent with complexes formed from equimolar amounts of ςE and RseAN generated only a modest amount of absorbance at 412 nm. Further, the absorbance at 412 nm during this experiment increased slowly with a steady rate while incubating for 800 s (Fig. 4). These data are consistent with a model in which the binding of RseA to the C-terminal portion of ςEblocks the access of Ellman's reagent to Cys165. Further, the slow increase in absorbance is likely caused by the dissociation of ςE-RseAN, thereby liberating the sulfhydryl at position 165 for modification with Ellman's reagent. RseAN does not contain cysteine residues, and incubation of RseAN alone with Ellman's reagent did not yield a significant absorbance at 412 nm (data not shown). Covalent modification of ςE with Ellman's reagent does not prevent the association of the sigma factor with either RseAN or core RNA polymerase, suggesting that Cys165 is not an essential residue for the formation of the ςE-RseAN complex (data not shown). Cys165 is located in a region of ςE that is homologous to the 4.2 domain of ς70 (Fig. 1). Region 4.2 of ς70 contains a putative helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif that interacts with the −35 element of ς70-dependent promoters. We assumed that mutations within the 4.2 region of ςE may likely display defects in the transcription at EςE-dependent promoters. To test this prediction, we sought to isolate mutations that decrease the transcription of EςE-dependent promoters. A strain carrying the nadB::tet allele was mutagenized with hydroxylamine (18Raina S. Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The nadB gene is linked to the rpoE operon. Bacteriophage P1 lysates of mutated cultures were transduced into E. coli MC4100 carrying therpoEP2-lacZ transcriptional fusion. Mutations linked to the TetR marker were selected for by plating on agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; 20 μg/ml) and tetracycline. Light blue TetR transductants were retained. Only mutations that co-transduced withtet R at a frequency greater than 90% linked to the TetR marker and that conferred temperature-sensitive growth above 37 °C were retained. The location of rpoE mutations was determined by DNA sequencing. Three of the isolated mutations changed the specificity of single codons within the 4.2 domain of ςE: R178G, I181A, and V185A. Each of the three mutations decreased transcriptional activity of ςE RNA polymerase at multiple promoters (htrA-lacZ, rpoEP2-lacZ andrpoHP3-lacZ), suggesting that the regulatory defects were neither allele- nor promoter-specific (Fig.5). We wondered whether rpoE mutations that affect promoter selection and/or transcriptional activity by ςE RNA polymerase caused a simultaneous effect on the binding of ςE to RseA. This possibility was tested in a biochemical experiment. Three mutant rpoE alleles were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the corresponding genes were cloned in the pET expression vector. The mutant proteins,HisςER178G,HisςEI181A, andHisςEV185A, were purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-NTA-Sepharose. When measured with a co-sedimentation assay,HisςER178G,HisςEI181A, andHisςEV185A bound to purified RNA core polymerase in a manner that was indistinguishable from the binding of wild-type ςE. Fig. 6shows the results of these experiments for wild-type ςEand ςER178G. To measure binding of ςE to RseA, nickel-NTA-Sepharose beads were charged with RseAN and incubated with enterokinase-cleaved ςE protein. Although co-sedimentation of wild-type ςE and RseAN was observed, neither ςER178G nor ςEI181Aor ςEV185A interacted with RseAN. Fig. 6 shows the results of the experiments for wild-type ςE and ςER178G. Alanine substitution of Cys165, the sulfhydryl residue, did not affect the in vitro binding of ςE to core polymerase or to RseAN (data not shown). ςE is a member of the ς70 family of proteins. These sigma factors are modular proteins, consisting of four conserved regions and their subregions (Fig. 1; reviewed in Ref. 19Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J. Young B. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Regions 2.4 and 4.2 encode two DNA binding determinants that allow for recognition of the conserved −10 and −35 regions of promoters, respectively. Region 1.1 is an autoinhibitory domain that masks the DNA binding determinants of ς70 when the transcription factor is not associated with RNA polymerase (20Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Interaction with core polymerase relieves region 1.1-mediated autoinhibition (20Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and reorients regions 3.1–4.2 of ς70 relative to the central 1.2–2.4 domains. These movements permit the selective recognition of −10 region promoter sequences by regions 2.3–2.4 (21Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although region 1.1 is present in many primary ς factors (ς70), this domain is absent in ςE. Mutational changes in regions 2, 3, and 4 of ς70 have been shown to decrease binding to RNA polymerase, and it has been proposed that putative contact sites exist between regions 2, 3, 4, and the α2ββ′ core (22Sharp M.M. Chan C.L., Lu, C.Z. Marr M.T. Nechaev S. Merritt E.W. Severinov K. Roberts J.W. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3015-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We have used limited trypsin digestion to probe the domain organization of ςE. One fragment resisted digestion by dilute amounts of trypsin and contained region 1.2 as well as region 2:ςE amino acids 1–91. These data correlate well with preliminary NMR experiments in which ςE residues 92–191, unlike amino acids 1–91, generated little resonance (data not shown). Thus, the C-terminal part of ςE (residues 92–191) does not assume a compact fold. The N-terminal peptide, ςE1–91, was cloned, expressed, and purified by affinity chromatography. Purified ςE1–91did not bind RseAN or core polymerase. The latter observation was a surprise to us, as fragment ς702, comprising region 1.2 and region 2 of ς70 (39 kDa), is known to bind to core RNA polymerase in a manner that competes with the binding of wild-type ς70(8Severinova E. Severinov K. Fenyo D. Marr M. Brody E.N. Roberts J.W. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although our measurements for binding of ςEfragments to core polymerase employed an assay similar to that of the ς70 studies, pronounced differences were observed (8Severinova E. Severinov K. Fenyo D. Marr M. Brody E.N. Roberts J.W. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although all three fragments, ςE1–116, ςE1–137, and ςE1–153, comprise region 1.2, only the largest fragment, ςE1–153, was capable of binding to core polymerase. The fact that RseA did not bind to ςE1–153, together with the observation that region 4.2 is located in the peptide sequence 153–191, suggested that RseA may bind region 4.2 of ςE. A direct demonstration of this hypothesis could not be achieved as ςE95–191 did not co-sediment with RseAN. One explanation for the negative result is a lack of structure of the C-terminal domain of ςE. Is it possible that RseA does bind to region 4.2 but only if this domain is tethered to the remainder of ςE? This notion is corroborated by several observations. First, ςE95–191 is unstable and rapidly forms aggregates that can be sedimented by centrifugation. Second, binding of RseA to ςE masks Cys165 for modification with Ellman's reagent, as if RseA occupies residues 153–191 (region 4.2). Third, region 4.2 was also characterized by isolating ςEvariants that fail to promote α2ββ′ ςE-mediated transcription of ςE-dependent promoters. Three amino acid substitutions mapped to region 4.2: R178G, I181A, and V185A. When tested in a biochemical experiment, all three ςEvariants failed to bind RseA although the association with core RNA polymerase was similar to that of wild-type ςE. Together these data suggest that RseA indeed binds to region 4.2 of ςE. The activity of several sigma factors is regulated by a cognate anti-sigma factor. Many pairs of sigma/anti-sigma factors have been identified, and their biological roles have been characterized (9Brody E.N. Kassavetis G.A. Ouhammouch M. Sanders G.M. Tinker R.L. Geiduschek G.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hughes K.T. Mathee K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 231-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Recently, the structural features of some anti-sigma factors and the binding sites for the cognate sigma factors have been elucidated (10Urbauer J.L. Adelman K. Urbauer R.J. Simeonov M.F.

The two anti-sigma factors of ς70, AsiA and Rsd, are about 10 kDa of mass. AsiA is encoded by the bacteriophage T4, and its association with the ς70 subunit of theE. coli RNA polymerase is one of the principal events controlling transcription of host cells and of the T4 genome. The recognition site of AsiA on ς70 has been mapped using NMR and alanine-scanning mutagenesis (10Urbauer J.L. Adelman K. Urbauer R.J. Simeonov M.F. Gilmore J.M. Zolkiewski M. Brody E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41128-41132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 11Minakhin L. Camarero J.A. Holford M. Parker C. Muir T.W. Severinov K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These studies showed that the highly conserved region 4.2 (and maybe 4.1) constitutes the AsiA-binding domain. Mutations that affect AsiA binding to ς70 are clustered in a stretch of 5 residues within the C-terminal half of region 4.2 (KAL595RK). These residues belong to a loop of charged residues (KAL595RKLRHPS) where Lys593, Arg596, Lys597, Arg599, and His600 contribute to the interaction with protein activators of transcription rather than directly to ς70 binding of DNA (26Lonetto M.A. Rhodius V. Lamberg K. Kiley P. Busby S. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1353-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27Landini P. Busby S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1524-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Modeling of residues 551 to 613 of ς70 on the structure of NarL and 434 Cro suggests that all of the charged residues are surfaced exposed in the HTH motif (26Lonetto M.A. Rhodius V. Lamberg K. Kiley P. Busby S. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1353-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Strikingly, RseA binding is dramatically affected by mutations clustered in the C-terminal half of region 4.2 of ςE (R178G, I181A, and V185A). Sequence alignment between ςE and ς70 shows that this region of ςE(RAR178EAI181DNKV185) corresponds to the stretch of charged residues described above for ς70 (KAL595RKLRHPS). Within ςEthese residues are also important for interaction with the DNA as alterations of Arg178, Ile181, and Val185 lead to decreased ςE activity in vivo. The recognition site of Rsd, a second anti-ς70factor produced by E. coli during stationary phase (13Jishage M. Ishihama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4953-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), has also been mapped to region 4 of ς70 (12Dove S.L. Hochschild A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6413-6421Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Jishage M. Dasgupta D. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2952-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions at two positions flanking arginine 596 (Leu595 and Leu598) disrupt the association of Rsd with ς70 in vitro (14Jishage M. Dasgupta D. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2952-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Hence, the same region of ς70 that is targeted for recognition by two unrelated anti-sigma factors appears to be important for the ςE-RseA interaction. We thank K. Faull (University of California, Los Angeles) for mass spectrometry measurements and O. Schneewind (University of Chicago) for critical review of this manuscript."

Garner W. Elder J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Expression of these ligands was markedly reduced after antibody-mediated or pharmacologic inhibition of ErbB-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity, suggestive of an autocrine stimulatory mechanism. Furthermore, selective inhibition of ErbB-RTK abrogates keratinocyte outgrowth from human skin explants (16Stoll S. Garner W. Elder J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well established function of ErbB receptors during wound repair, little is known about the downstream signaling events that become activated during this process. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 become activated in response to growth factor-related signals, whereas the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 kinases become activated in response to environmental stress and inflammatory cytokines (17Chang L. Karin M. Suomela S. Kariniemi A.L. Snellman E. Saarialho-Kere U. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4396) Google Scholar). Because ERK1 and ERK2 are generally associated with growth factor signaling and because our previous studies demonstrated a large increase in ErbB ligand expression during wound healing (16Stoll S. Garner W. Elder J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that ERK acts as a downstream mediator of ErbB signaling to the nucleus during wound repair. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of pharmacologic inhibitors of MEK activation, ErbB-RTK activity, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) function on a variety of biochemical responses in human skin organ culture. Our results demonstrate that ERK activation is an important component of the signaling mechanism leading to gene expression in wounded skin and that ErbB signaling makes a major contribution to ERK activation during this process. Our data also indicate that proteolytic release of one or more ErbB ligands by matrix metalloproteinases is a major mechanism responsible for ErbB and subsequent MAPK activation in wounded skin. The MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 and the metalloproteinase inhibitor BB2516 were from Calbiochem. The ErbB-RTKI PD158780 was provided by Drs. David Fry and Wilbur Leopold (Pfizer). Human recombinant EGF was from Sigma or from BD PharMingen Collaborative Biomedical Products (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Antibodies directed against non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of ERK were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against ErbB family members were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ) and Labvision (Fremont, CA). The mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Radioisotopes were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Human skin keratomes at a depth of 0.2–0.4 mm were harvested from the buttocks of healthy volunteers as previously described (18Voorhees J.J. Duell E.A. Bass L.J. Powell J.A. Harrell E.R. Arch. Dermatol. 1972; 105: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All procedures involving human subjects were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan. Normal human keratinocytes (passage 2–4) were cultured in serum-free MCDB 153 medium optimized for high density keratinocyte growth (19Wille J., Jr. Pittelkow M.R. Shipley G.D. Scott R.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 121: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The medium (Medium 154 CF, Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR) was purchased in calcium-free form and supplemented with CaCl2 to a final concentration of 0.1 mm as previously described (8Stoll S.W. Kansra S. Peshick S. Fry D.W. Leopold W.R. Wiesen J.F. Sibilia M. Zhang T. Werb Z. Derynck R. Wagner E.F. Elder J.T. Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). At ∼40–50% confluence, the cells were depleted of exogenous growth factors by incubation in basal medium for 48 h. The cells were then pretreated with various concentrations of PD158780 (0.0016–1 μm) or PD98059 (0.08–50 μm) with a change of medium. After 1 additional hour, cells were stimulated with 16.5 nm EGF for 10 min and then lysed and processed for Western blotting as described below. Human skin keratome fragments (6-mm circular punches or 1-cm squares) were incubated at room temperature in keratinocyte basal medium containing 0.1 mm Ca2+ (Medium 154 CF, Cascade Biologics) in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor PD98059, the ErbB-RTK inhibitor PD158780 (20Rewcastle G.W. Murray D.K. Elliott W.L. Fry D.W. Howard C.T. Nelson J.M. Roberts B.J. Vincent P.W. Showalter H.D. Winters R.T. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), or the metalloproteinase inhibitor BB2516 (21Glaser K.B. Pease L., Li, J. Morgan D.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 6-mm punch fragments were divided into eighths in order to increase the total area of wounded skin tissue. Organ cultures were allowed to stand for 30 min at room temperature to assure equilibration of the inhibitor and then warmed to 37 °C to initiate signaling. We have shown that organ cultures are transcriptionally inert when maintained at room temperature or below (16Stoll S. Garner W. Elder J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Organ cultures were maintained at 37 °C for various times prior to harvest (0–24 h). In some experiments, EGF (100 ng/ml, 16.5 nm) was added to selected samples just prior to transferring the cultures to 37 °C. Organ cultures were processed for RNA or protein isolation and analyzed by Northern or Western blotting as described below. Total RNA was isolated from human skin keratomes (∼1 cm2 in size) as previously described (16Stoll S. Garner W. Elder J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Equal microgram amounts (20–30 μg) were separated electrophoretically on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes (Zeta-probe, Bio-Rad), and hybridized against 32P-labeled c-Jun, c-Fos, HB-EGF, AR, VEGF, and 36B4 cDNA inserts as previously described (16Stoll S. Garner W. Elder J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Elder J.T. Tavakkol A. Klein S.B. Zeigler M.E. Wicha M. Voorhees J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 19-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were quantitated by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and normalized against the control gene 36B4 (23Laborda J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as percentage of untreated controls. Cultured human keratinocytes were washed twice in 1× PBS, scraped into 1 ml of 1× Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol), and heated for 10 min at 100 °C (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Human skin keratomes were cut into pieces using a 6-mm diameter biopsy punch. Two such pieces were placed in 500 μl of preheated 1× sample buffer and maintained at 100 °C for 10 min in a heating block, then vortexed for 10 s. The lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. Protein concentrations were estimated byA280, and equal microgram amounts were separated on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blots were blocked by incubation in 1× PBS/0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min and incubated with anti-ERK (1:1000), anti-phospho ERK (1:1000), anti-ErbB1 (TL13, Transduction Laboratories, 0.5 μg/ml), anti-ErbB2 (Ab-17, Labvision, 0.5 μg/ml) or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (0.5 μg/ml) for 16 h at 4 °C. The blots were washed three times for 5 min in PBST (ERK antibodies) or two times for 30 min in 1× PBS (anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-ErbB antibodies) and then incubated with 1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h. The membranes were washed as described above except that blots incubated with anti-ErbB1, anti-ErbB2, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were washed for an additional 5 min in PBST prior to detection of specific protein-antibody complexes by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus,Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence was quantitated by densitometry of x-ray films using an Amersham Biosciences densitometer. Base-line signals were obtained from an area of equal size just above the phospho-ERK band. Whenever subtraction of the base-line signal yielded a negative number, the phospho-ERK signal intensity for that lane was assigned a zero value. Normal human keratinocytes were depleted of growth factors for 48 h and treated with EGF as described above. The cells were then lysed in buffer A (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 250 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and immunoprecipitated as previously described (8Stoll S.W. Kansra S. Peshick S. Fry D.W. Leopold W.R. Wiesen J.F. Sibilia M. Zhang T. Werb Z. Derynck R. Wagner E.F. Elder J.T. Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using antibodies directed against ErbB1 or ErbB2 (Ab-13 or Ab-2, respectively, Labvision). Controls contained the same concentration of an isotype-matched control mouse IgG (Sigma). Equal aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting and immunodetection as described above. As shown in Fig.1A, left panels, the MEK activation inhibitor PD98059 inhibited EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation in cultured human keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition to basal levels was observed at 50 μm PD98059. EGF markedly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 170–190-kDa band in cultured keratinocytes (Fig. 1A, right panels). The pan-ErbB inhibitor PD158780 reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of this band in a dose-dependent fashion. At concentrations of 0.2 and 1 μm, PD158780 also inhibited ERK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner to below basal levels. Immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1B) confirmed that EGF stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB1 under these conditions and that EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB1 can be blocked by PD158780. In contrast, ErbB2 did not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation after EGF stimulation (Fig. 1B, right panels). ErbB1 protein levels were consistently increased by PD158780 pretreatment, presumably because of inhibition of ongoing ErbB degradation. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we next determined the activation status of ERK in normal and organ-cultured human skin. Levels of ERK phosphorylation were quite variable in freshly harvested skin not subjected to organ culture (compare Figs.2 and 4). The time course of ERK phosphorylation was also variable despite constant levels of total ERK. This variability is illustrated in the two independent experiments shown in Fig. 2A. Replicate samples of the same keratome tissue displayed reproducible levels of ERK phosphorylation for any given time point (data not shown). Increasing the lateral surface area of wounding by cutting 6-mm keratome fragments into 8 smaller pieces increased ERK activation by only ∼50%, despite a 3.5-fold increase in the lateral surface area (data not shown).Figure 4Inhibition of metalloproteinase activity blocks and EGF restores MAP kinase activation in human skin organ culture. Organ cultures were incubated in the presence or absence of 20 μm BB2516. After 2 h, 100 ng/ml (16.5 nm) of EGF was added to some cultures for 10 min followed immediately by tissue lysis. Lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with phospho-ERK or total ERK antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Despite variable levels of ERK activity, the MEK activation inhibitor PD98059 consistently and markedly (by 97% or more) reduced ERK phosphorylation at 0.5, 2, and 4 h (Fig. 2B). The ErbB-RTK inhibitor PD158780 also produced a marked inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in organ culture, which was substantial (92%) even at 30 min. By 2 h of organ culture, inhibition by PD158780 was significantly less marked than that produced by PD98059 (p = 0.0017 by Tukey's HSD test), but it was still prominent (70.9%) (Fig. 2B). Fig.3A demonstrates that c-Fos and c-Jun mRNAs are strongly induced after as little as 30 min of organ culture. HB-EGF and AR mRNA were induced with a delay of 60–120 min relative to c-Jun and c-Fos, whereas VEGF messages were only detectable at 8 h. PD98059 markedly reduced the mRNA levels of all genes tested (Fig. 3A). Inhibition of HB-EGF gene expression by PD158780 and PD98059 was dose-dependent (Fig.3B). However, inhibition was incomplete, falling to only 35% of control levels in the presence of 50 μm PD98059 and to 45% of control in the presence of 10 μm PD158780. In contrast, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation was essentially complete at 50 μm PD98059 and at 1 μm PD158780 in keratinocyte cell cultures (Fig. 1) and in skin organ culture (Fig. 2). Incomplete inhibition of c-fos, c-jun, andVEGF gene expression by 50 μm PD98059 is also evident from inspection of Fig. 3A. The metalloproteinase inhibitor BB2516 markedly reduced ERK phosphorylation at 2 h of organ culture to 31 ± 6% of control values observed in untreated organ cultures (mean ± S.E., n = 8, Fig.2). In four of four experiments, addition of EGF to BB2516-pretreated organ cultures restored ERK phosphorylation to levels at least as high as those observed in untreated organ cultures (Fig. 4). Treatment with EGF alone had variable effects on ERK phosphorylation (194 ± 42% of control organ cultures without additives, mean ± S.E., n = 3). In three of three experiments, ERK phosphorylation in BB2516 + EGF-treated cultures was restored to at least the level observed in cultures treated with EGF alone. Quantitative comparison to the other inhibitors revealed that the effect of BB2516 was significantly less marked than that produced by PD98059 (Tukey's HSD test, p = 0.0003 at 0.5 h and p = 0.0006 at 2 h) (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the blockade of metalloproteinase and ERK activities in organ culture might lead to an inhibition of gene expression similar to that seen for ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2B), we prepared RNA from organ cultures treated for various times with each of the three inhibitors. Northern blots were hybridized, stripped, and sequentially re-hybridized against c-Fos, c-Jun, HB-EGF, AR, and 36B4. A representative experiment is shown in Fig.5A. The results of multiple experiments are quantitated for c-Fos and c-Jun in Fig. 5Band for HB-EGF in Fig. 5C. Statistical analysis of these results revealed that PD98059 was significantly more effective than either PD158780 or BB2516 as an inhibitor of the rapid and transient increase in c-Fos and c-Jun mRNA at 30 min (Tukey's HSD test,p ⩽ 0.02, Fig. 5B). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the effectiveness of these three compounds as inhibitors of the more delayed HB-EGF mRNA response (Fig.5C). As was previously discussed for PD98059, PD158780 and BB2516 yielded only incomplete inhibition of gene responses, reaching a maximum of 55–70% inhibition (Fig. 5, B andC). Although the importance of ErbB signaling in wound healing is well recognized (12Jensen P.J. Rodeck U. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Jiang C.K.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which ErbB signaling is activated and propagated to the nucleus remain poorly defined. In this study we have investigated whether the ERK pathway could act as a mediator of ErbB receptor signaling during wound repair. To confirm the potency of our inhibitors, we performed preliminary experiments in cultured keratinocytes rendered EGF responsive by growth factor depletion (26Coffey R.J., Jr. Derynck R. Wilcox J.N. Bringman T.S. Goustin A.S. Moses H.L. Pittelkow M.R. Nature. 1987; 328: 817-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). EGF treatment clearly increased ERK phosphorylation under these conditions (Fig. 1A). Western blotting and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that EGF markedly stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB1 but not ErbB2 (Fig. 1B). This finding is consistent with our previous demonstration that ErbB1 is expressed on the keratinocyte cell surface, whereas ErbB2 is sequestered within intracellular vesicles (8Stoll S.W. Kansra S. Peshick S. Fry D.W. Leopold W.R. Wiesen J.F. Sibilia M. Zhang T. Werb Z. Derynck R. Wagner E.F. Elder J.T. Neoplasia. 2001; 3: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PD158780 is a selective and reversible inhibitor of all known ErbB tyrosine kinases (20Rewcastle G.W. Murray D.K. Elliott W.L. Fry D.W. Howard C.T. Nelson J.M. Roberts B.J. Vincent P.W. Showalter H.D. Winters R.T. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This compound reduced ERK phosphorylation to below basal levels (Fig. 1A) and completely inhibited EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB1 (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these findings indicate that virtually all the ERK phosphorylation present in growth factor-depleted keratinocytes is a consequence of basal ErbB1-RTK activity. PD98059 is a highly specific inhibitor of the activation of MEK1/2 (27Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar), which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK1 and ERK2. Because no other major proximal activators of ERK1/2 other than MEK1/2 have been described (28Guan K.L. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), PD98059 can be regarded as a specific inhibitor of ERK signaling. As expected, basal and EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation in human keratinocytes could be blocked by 50 μm PD98059 (Fig. 1A), confirming earlier studies indicating that EGF-induced activation of ERK is mediated by MEK in keratinocytes (29Zeigler M.E. Chi Y. Schmidt T. Varani J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The potency of PD98059 was consistent with that observed by others (27Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar,29Zeigler M.E. Chi Y. Schmidt T. Varani J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We observed variable levels of basal ERK phosphorylation in skin samples not subjected to organ culture. We also observed a variable time course of ERK phosphorylation in untreated organ cultures (examples shown in Figs. 2 and 4). This variability was not due to sampling, because replicate fragments of the same keratome gave highly reproducible results at any given time point (data not shown). The source of this variability remains to be elucidated; however, it must lie at or upstream of MEK because the MEK activation inhibitor PD98059 produced a marked (97–98%) and very consistent inhibition of ERK phosphorylation at all time points tested (Fig. 2). The marked and consistent inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in organ-cultured skin by the ErbB inhibitor PD158780 (Fig. 2) clearly demonstrates that ErbB1-RTK activation is a major pathway leading to ERK activation in this system. The fact that inhibition of ERK activation was incomplete (Fig. 2B), even at doses of PD158780 sufficient to abrogate EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB1 and phosphorylation of ERK in keratinocytes (Fig. 1), indicates that signal transduction pathways not present in cultured keratinocytes contribute to ErbB-independent ERK activation in wounded skin. These additional inputs to ERK activation remain to be determined. Dividing the keratome fragments into eighths increased the lateral wound surface area by 3.5-fold yet produced only a 50% increase in ERK activity. This observation suggests that the skin tissue is already substantially injured as a result of the keratome-harvesting procedure. When set to a depth of 0.2–0.4 mm, the keratome produces a substantial wound near the dermal-epidermal junction, frequently interrupting the epidermal basement membrane. Thus, overall epidermal injury should not be markedly increased by increasing the cut edges at the lateral margins of the specimen. The primarily epidermal nature of the keratome biopsy also limits the likelihood that cell types other than keratinocytes (e.g. fibroblasts, endothelial cells) make a substantial contribution to the process of ErbB1/ERK activation in this system. Thus, the observed events are likely to primarily involve keratinocytes. We previously reported the induction of c-Fos and c-Jun mRNA after 2 h of organ culture (22Elder J.T. Tavakkol A. Klein S.B. Zeigler M.E. Wicha M. Voorhees J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 19-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have demonstrated marked induction of these transcripts as early as 30 min (Fig. 3A). We have observed that c-Fos mRNA accumulates more rapidly than does c-Jun in skin organ culture (Fig.3A). This finding is consistent with the known requirement for increased c-Fos transcription and translation and the formation of c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers in order to increase c-Jun transcription (30Shaulian E.

The unique abilities of streptokinase to nonproteolytically activate plasminogen or to alter the interactions of plasmin with substrates and inhibitors may be the result of high affinity binding mediated by the streptokinase β-domain. To examine this hypothesis, a chimeric streptokinase, SKβswap, was created by swapping the SK β-domain with the homologous β-domain of Streptococcus uberis Pg activator (SUPA or PauA, SK uberis), a streptokinase that cannot activate human plasminogen. SKβswap formed a tight complex with microplasminogen with an affinity comparable with streptokinase. The SKβswap-plasmin complex also activated human plasminogen with catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km = 16.8versus 15.2 μm−1 min−1) comparable with streptokinase. However, SKβswap was incapable of nonproteolytic active site generation and activated plasminogen by a staphylokinase mechanism. When compared with streptokinase complexes, SKβswap-plasmin and SKβswap-microplasmin complexes had altered affinities for low molecular weight substrates. The SKβswap-plasmin complex also was less resistant than the streptokinase-plasmin complex to inhibition by α2-antiplasmin and was readily inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor.

Hematol. 1996; 73: S9-27PubMed Google Scholar), the structural bases for its unique molecular properties are just now being elucidated (8Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Both SK and SAK form a cofactor-enzyme complex with plasmin that cleaves Pg substrate (9Kowalska-Loth B. Zakrzewski K. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1975; 22: 327-339PubMed Google Scholar, 10Buck F.F. Hummel B.C. De Renzo E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3648-3654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sakai M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8284-8289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, SK contains three domains (α, β, and γ) (8Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whereas SAK only contains one domain (13Parry M.A. Fernandez-Catalan C. Bergner A. Huber R. Hopfner K.P. Schlott B.

De Maeyer M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Consequently, the interactions of SK with plasmin and Pg (P(g)) are more extensive and complex. For example, SK has 4100 Å2(α-domain = 1650 Å2, β-domain = 950 Å2, and γ-domain = 1500 Å2) of intermolecular contact with microplasmin (8Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), whereas SAK has only 1750 Å2 of contact (13Parry M.A. Fernandez-Catalan C. Bergner A. Huber R. Hopfner K.P. Schlott B. Guhrs K.H. Bode W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, SK forms a tighter and more stable complex with P(g) (15Cederholm-Williams S.A., De Cock F. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1980; 43: 77-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) than SAK (6Lijnen H.R., De Cock F. Van Hoef B. Schlott B. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Sakharov D.V. Lijnen H.R. Rijken D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27912-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The stability of SK·P(g) complex may contribute to the major mechanistic differences between SK and SAK in Pg activation. In this stable complex, SK profoundly alters the interactions of plasmin with substrates (fibrin and Pg) and inhibitors (α2-antiplasmin), whereas SAK does not (18Gonias S.L. Figler N.L. Braud L.L. Blood. 1988; 72: 1658-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this complex, SK also has the unique property of nonproteolytically generating or rearranging the latent active site of Pg to make it catalytically active (Pg*), although SAK does not (3Reddy K.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Collen D. Van Hoef B. Schlott B. Hartmann M. Guhrs K.H. Lijnen H.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The ability of SK to form a tight stable complex with Pg arises in large part from high affinity binding interactions between the β-domains of SK and Pg (20Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami S.B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Conejero-Lara F. Parrado J. Azuaga A.I. Dobson C.M. Ponting C.P.

However, catalytically, the SK-microplasmin complex is a more efficient Pg activator than the complex of SK with the entire P(g) molecule despite the fact that SK binds to microplasmin with lower affinity than it does to plasmin (24Shi G.Y. Change B.I., Wu, D.H., Ha, Y.M. Wu H.L. Thromb. Res. 1990; 58: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,25Lin L.F. Houng A. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4740-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the SK-microplasmin complex, the α- and γ-domains have extensive intermolecular contacts with microplasmin, whereas the β-domain has relatively few interactions with microplasmin (8Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Still, a number of studies have shown that the β-domain is required for plasminogen activation (25Lin L.F. Houng A. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4740-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Young K.C. Shi G.Y. Chang Y.F. Chang B.I. Chang L.C. Lai M.D. Chuang W.J. Wu H.L. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the paucity of interactions of the β-domain with microplasmin suggests that the β-domain does not contribute substantially to the stability or the catalytic function of this activator complex. If this is true, the β-domain may serve merely as a linker or spacer unit that optimally positions the α- and γ-domains for functional interactions with microplasmin and substrate (21Conejero-Lara F. Parrado J. Azuaga A.I. Dobson C.M. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2190-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the function of the β-domain may be to modulate the interactions of substrates with the activator complex. The goal of these studies was to examine the role of the SK β-domain in the function of the SK·P(g) and SK-microplasmin(ogen) activator complex. These studies took advantage of the exquisitely restricted ability of SK molecules to activate mammalian Pgs from other species. For example, SK activates human Pg but not bovine or horse Pg, whereasStreptococcus uberis Pg activator (SUPA or PauA, SK uberis) activates bovine but not human Pg (28Johnsen L.B. Poulsen K. Kilian M. Petersen T.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Johnsen L.B. Rasmussen L.K. Petersen T.E. Etzerodt M. Fedosov S.N.

The molecular swapping of these two closely related β-domains, SK β-domain and β-domain of SUPA, to create SKα·SUPAβ·SKγ chimera (SKβswap) allowed us to elucidate the role of the β-domain in 1) active site generation, 2) Pg activation and, 3) interactions with plasmin inhibitor α2-antiplasmin. Recombinant SUPA, SK, micro-Pg, and micro-PgR561A mutant were cloned, expressed in bacteria, purified, and characterized as described previously (20Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami S.B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Sazonova I.Y. Houng A.K. Chowdhry S.A. Robinson B.R. Hedstrom L. Reed G.L. J. Biol.

The SUPA sequence was modeled on the SK structural coordinates using a Swiss model program (www.expasy.ch). Residues 126–261 of the SUPA β-domain were found to closely recapitulate residues 146–281 of the SK β-domain. Consequently, the cDNA for the SKβswap chimera was generated in such a way that the codons for residues 146–281 of SK were replaced by the codons for residues 126–281 of SUPA by PCR with an overlap extension as we have described previously (33Liu L. Sazonova I.Y. Turner R.B. Chowdhry S.A. Tsai J. Houng A.K. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37686-37691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The SKβswap chimera cDNA was ligated into the pMALc vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for expression as a maltose-binding fusion protein in bacteria (20Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami S.B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The maltose-binding protein-SKβswap fusion protein was absorbed on DEAE Affi-Gel Blue-agarose, and purified protein was eluted between 75 and 160 nm NaCl by a linear gradient of 0–250 mmNaCl in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The chimeric structure was cleaved from maltose-binding protein by treatment with Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) for 5 h at room temperature in 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2. The separated SKβswap was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody 9D10 directed to residues 1–13 of SK α-domain to confirm that the NH2 terminus remained intact after cleavage (34Reed G.L. Kussie P. Parhami S.B. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4407-4415PubMed Google Scholar). Human Pg (≥95% Glu-Pg, Chromogenix, Milano, Italy) was radioiodinated by the Iodogen method (35Fraker P.J. Speck J.C., Jr. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar), and the specific radioactivity was determined as described previously (36Lukacova D. Matsueda G.R. Haber E. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10164-10170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The molar quantity of active sites generated nonproteolytically by the SK in human Pg or by SUPA in bovine Pg was determined at 37 °C in a Hitachi 2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer by active site titration with the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate (MUGB, Sigma) as described previously (20Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami S.B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle W.S. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The activity of SKβswap (35–39% active) was determined by an indirect titration method. Human Pg (98 nm) was preincubated with different amounts of SKβswap (0–200 nm) and then with a stoichiometric amount of SK (98 nm) for 8 min on ice. Subsequently, the hydrolysis of MUGB was monitored, and the active concentration of SKβswap was calculated from a graph that showed an inverse linear dependence of SK·Pg active concentration on the total SKβswap concentration. All of the experiments subsequently described were performed in an assay buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) with 0.5 mmS2251 (H-d-valyl-l-leucyl-l-lysine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride, Chromogenix). The ability of SKβswap to generate active sites in the Pg molecule was examined using a recombinant noncleavable micro-PgR561A mutant that can only be activated through nonproteolytic mechanisms (38Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Equimolar complexes of micro-PgR561A·SKβswap or micro-PgR561A·SK (final concentration 50 nm) were prepared by mixing micro-PgR561A and SK or SKβswap for 10 min to 24 h at 37 °C. The complexes were transferred to a thermostatically regulated (37 °C) quartz cuvette containing assay buffer and S2251 in a total volume of 300 μl, and the change of absorbance was monitored at 405 nm for 10 min in a Cary 100-Bio spectrophotometer. The amidase kinetic parameters of the activator complexes were measured with a p-nitroanilide substrate S2251 as described previously (31Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 39Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The equimolar complexes (final concentration 5 nm) were prepared by mixing human plasmin (Sigma) or human microplasmin and SK, SUPA, or SKβswap for 10 min on ice. Microplasmin was generated from micro-Pg by urokinase (1:30 ratio) at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme complexes to assay buffer containing various concentrations of S2251 (final concentration 50–1500 μm) in a total volume of 100 μl in microtiter plates at 37 °C. The generation of amidolytic activity at 405 nm was monitored at 37 °C for 10 min in a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA). Less than 10%H-d-Val-l-Leu-l-Lys-nitroanilide was consumed during the course of the reaction. The data were plotted as velocity/substrate and analyzed by hyperbolic curve fitting with the Sigma Plot program. A ε1 M at 405 nm of 10,000 was used for p-nitroanilide. The kinetics of Pg activation by activator complexes were studied as described previously (39Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stoichiometric activator complexes (final concentration 5–25 nm) were formed by mixing human plasmin or microplasmin and SK or SKβswap on ice for 10 min. The activators were added to microtiter plates containing assay buffer, 0.5 mm S2251, and human Glu-Pg (≥95% Glu-Pg) (final concentration 500–1600 nm) or microplasminogen (100–900 nm) in a total volume of 100 μl. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C in a microplate reader. Initial reaction rates were obtained from the first 300 s by plottingA405/min2, and the apparent Michaelis-Menten and catalytic rate constants were calculated by fitting the data to a hyperbolic curve as described previously (39Wohl R.C. Summaria L. Robbins K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2005-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the Sigma Plot program. Unlike SK, SKβswap cannot generate an active site in micro-PgR561A mutant to convert it to the enzyme, micro-PgR561A*. Hence, the ability of SKβswap to form an inactive complex with micro-PgR561A mutant was examined indirectly using SKβswap as an inhibitor of active site generation and consequent amidolysis by the SK-micro-PgR561A*. The micro-PgR561A mutant (final concentration 50 nm) was preincubated for 25 min at 37 °C with different amounts of SKβswap (final concentration 0–200 nm) and then with a stoichiometric amount of SK (final concentration 50 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C. The preincubated complex was added to a cuvette containing assay buffer and S2251 (final concentration 0.5 mm). The hydrolysis of S2251 was monitored at 405 nm in a Cary 100-Bio spectrophotometer. Because only the complex with SK has amidolytic activity, the fraction of Pg bound to SK can be determined by the rate of S2251 hydrolysis. The apparent inhibition constant was calculated as described previously (40Bieth J. Frechin J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 364: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using Equation 1 [I]o/(1−a)=Ki(app)/a+[SK­micro­PgR561A∗]o,Equation 1 where a is the fraction of total enzyme, SK-micro-PgR561A*, which is not bound to the inhibitor, [I]ois a total inhibitor SKβswap concentration, andKi(app) is the dissociation constant of microplasmin-R561A·SKβswap complex without accounting for the influence of the substrate. Human plasmin (final concentration 5 or 50 nm) or stoichiometric complexes of SK-plasmin or SKβswap-plasmin (final concentration 5 or 50 nm) were mixed together for 3 min at room temperature and then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with increasing concentrations of α2-antiplasmin (final concentrations 0–15 nm) or soybean Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) (final concentration 0–800 nm). The reaction was initiated by the addition of assay buffer containing S2251 (0.5 mm) in a total volume of 100 μl in microtiter plates at 37 °C. The change of absorbance at 405 nm was monitored in a microplate reader for 10 min. The wells of microtiter plates were coated with SK (5 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed, and nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Radioiodinated human Glu-Pg (50,000 cpm/25 μl) was added to the wells for 1 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of SK (0.5–500 μg/ml) or SKβswap (0.5–500 μg/ml). Afterward, the wells were washed and γ-counted. Molecular modeling studies indicated that residues 126–261 of the SUPA β-domain closely recapitulated the structure of the SK β-domain (residues 146–281) (30Sazonova I.Y. Houng A.K. Chowdhry S.A. Robinson B.R. Hedstrom L. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12609-12613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These sequences were swapped to create a chimeric SK molecule, which consisted of SK α-domain, SUPA β-domain, and SK γ-domain (SKβswap). The ability of SK, SUPA, and SKβswap chimera to activate human Glu-Pg was compared. As expected, SK but not SUPA activated human Glu-Pg. The chimeric SKβswap retained the ability of SK to activate human Glu-Pg (Fig. 1). A fundamental distinction between a SK and SAK mechanism is the ability of SK to generate an active site in Pg under conditions in which proteolysis is blocked (19Collen D. Van Hoef B. Schlott B. Hartmann M. Guhrs K.H. Lijnen H.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 41Reddy K.N. Markus G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 51: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We examined nonproteolytic active site generation by SKβswap to determine whether the β-domain played a role in this process. These studies used a recombinant micro-Pg (micro-PgR561A) in which the activation bond sequence Arg561-Val562 had been mutated to prevent proteolytic cleavage to the plasmin. SK generated an active site within micro-PgR561A mutant as we have previously shown (32Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 38Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but the SKβswap did not generate an active site even after 24-h incubation at 37 °C. Similarly, when active site titration experiments were performed in the presence of excess acylating agent, MUGB, SK was capable of nonproteolytic active site generation, but SKβswap was not (data not shown). The SK β-domain has been shown to be required for high affinity binding interactions between SK and Pg (20Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami S.B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Rodriguez P. Fuentes P. Barro M. Alvarez J.G. Munoz E. Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, a potential explanation for the failure of the SKβswap to generate an active site was that it was incapable of forming a complex with the micro-PgR561A mutant. However, in binding experiments, radioiodinated human Pg bound to SKβswap at levels comparable with SK (Fig.2). In addition, SKβswap was an efficient inhibitor of active site generation, and amidolysis by SK-micro-Pg*R561A (Fig. 3, inhibition constant of 15 nm). Thus, SKβswap formed a complex with micro-PgR561A but was incapable of nonproteolytic active site formation, suggesting that like SAK, SKβswap activated Glu-Pg by forming an activator complex with plasmin.Figure 3SK βswap inhibits active site generation in micro-PgR561A by SK. The micro-PgR561A mutant (final concentration 50 nm) was preincubated with different amounts of SKβswap (final concentration 0–200 nm) for 25 min at 37 °C and then with a stoichiometric amount of SK for 15 min at 37 °C. Preincubated complex was added to a cuvette containing assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH7.4) and S2251 (final concentration 0.5 mm). The hydrolysis of S2251 was monitored for 10 min at 405 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetic studies were performed to determine whether the β-domain contributes to substrate processing by SK activator complex. The kinetic parameters of cleavage of the tripeptide substrate S2251 at pH 7.4 and 37 °C by human plasmin, microplasmin, and activator complexes are shown in Table I. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants, Km, were ∼4-fold higher for microplasmin than plasmin. When SK formed a complex with plasmin or microplasmin, it decreased theKm by ∼2–4-fold. When SKβswap formed a complex with plasmin, it also decreased the Km by ∼4-fold, but it had little effect on the Km for microplasmin. In contrast, when SUPA formed a complex with plasmin, it decreased theKm by ∼7-fold. Thus, SKβswap had distinctive effects on amidolysis kinetics by various plasmins, which were intermediate between those of SK and SUPA.Table IKinetic constants for amidolysisEnzymeAmidolytic parametersKmkcatkcat/Kmμms−1μm−1s−1Human plasmin500 ± 9014.2 ± 0.50.028SK-plasmin250 ± 926.4 ± 0.60.106SKβswap-plasmin125 ± 512.8 ± 0.20.102SUPA-plasmin75 ± 64.9 ± 0.10.065Microplasmin2107 ± 11018.6 ± 1.00.009SK-microplasmin543 ± 4327.0 ± 7.00.05SKβswap-microplasmin2551 ± 7322.0 ± 4.00.009SUPA-microplasmin375 ± 305.6 ± 1.00.015Amidolytic experiments were carried out at 37 °C in a total volume of 100 μl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values represent the mean ± S.E.

Because previous studies noted above had indicated that SKβswap activated Pg through forming a complex with plasmin, we examined Pg activation by SKβswap-plasmin or SKβswap-microplasmin complexes. Although the Kmand kcat were lower, the overall catalytic efficiencies of the SKβswap-plasmin complex for Glu-Pg activation were comparable with that of the SK-plasmin complex and similar to the catalytic efficiency of SK for Glu-Pg (TableII).Table IIKinetic constants for activation of human plasminogen and microplasminogenActivatorPlasminogen activation parametersPlasminogenKmkcatkcat/Kmnmmin−1μm−1min−1SKGlu-Pg2-aKinetic parameters of SK were determined by Reed et al.

Open table in a new tab Activation experiments were carried out at 37 °C in a total volume of 100 μl, and kinetic parameters were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values represent the mean ± S.E. The kinetic constants for Glu-Pg and micro-Pg activation by SKβswap or SK activator complexes are also summarized in Table II. The SKβswap-microplasmin and SK-microplasmin complexes showed similar catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) as activators of micro-Pg. In contrast, the SK-microplasmin complex was a more catalytically efficient (52-fold) activator of Glu-Pg than the SKβswap-microplasmin complex, largely because of a higher catalytic rate constant (18-fold). The affinity of SKβswap-microplasmin complex for Glu-Pg substrate was 14-fold less than SKβswap-plasmin. Consequently, the SKβswap-plasmin activator complex was more catalytically efficient. The fact that SK alters the resistance of plasmin to inhibitors is a hallmark of the affinity and stability of the SK-plasmin complex versus the SAK-plasmin complex (18Gonias S.L. Figler N.L. Braud L.L. Blood. 1988; 72: 1658-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether the β-domain played a role in the interactions of the SK-plasmin activator complex with α2-antiplasmin or the reversible inhibitor SBTI. When compared with human plasmin alone, preformed complexes of SK or SKβswap with plasmin resisted inhibition by increasing the doses of α2-antiplasmin (Fig.4A). However, in these studies, the SKβswap-plasmin complex was less resistant to α2-antiplasmin inhibition than the SK-plasmin activator complex. The preformed SK-plasmin complex was completely resistant to the inhibitory effect of the SBTI, whereas plasmin and the SKβswap-plasmin complex were completely inhibited (Fig.4B). The sequence and structural homology between SK β-domain and β-domain of SUPA (27.4%) (28Johnsen L.B. Poulsen K. Kilian M. Petersen T.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sazonova I.Y. Houng A.K. Chowdhry S.A. Robinson B.R. Hedstrom L. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12609-12613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) provided an opportunity to determine the role of the β-domain in the function of the SK-Pg activator complex. A SKβswap chimera was examined for its function in 1) active site generation, 2) Pg activation, and 3) interactions with the plasmin inhibitors α2-antiplasmin and SBTI. The SKβswap retained the ability to activate human Pg similar to the parent SK molecule (Fig. 1). However, despite being an efficient activator, the SKβswap lost its ability to activate Glu-Pg nonproteolytically, which is a hallmark of SK and SUPA. Instead, SKβswap activated Pg by a staphylokinase-like mechanism through forming an activator complex with plasmin. The conclusion that SKβswap activated human Pg through staphylokinase-like and not streptokinase-like mechanism was supported by the following results. 1) SKβswap was unable to generate an active site in the uncleavable micro-PgR561A mutant (Fig. 2). 2) SKβswap did not form an active site in Pg, which was titratable with MUGB. 3) The activation of Glu-Pg by SKβswap-Pgs complexes preincubated on ice or at 37 °C gave artifactually lower kinetics constants than SKβswap-plasmin complexes (data not shown). The switch from a streptokinase-like to staphylokinase-like Pg activation mechanism was unexpected, because both SK and SUPA activate Pg (human or bovine) through streptokinase-like mechanisms (3Reddy K.N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12609-12613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies have emphasized the roles of the SK α- and γ-domains but not the SK β-domains in this process (32Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3994-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 38Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42Loy J.A. Lin X. Schenone M. Castellino F.J. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14686-14695Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, the SK β-domain alone cannot independently induce active site formation in Pg, 2I. Y. Sazonova and G. L. Reed, unpublished data. and the isolated β-domain of SUPA (residues 97–261) was also incapable of virgin activation of Pg (29Johnsen L.B. Rasmussen L.K. Petersen T.E. Etzerodt M. Fedosov S.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6440-6448Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An important distinction between SK and SAK is the ability of SK to form a very tight stable complex with Pg (6Lijnen H.R., De Cock F. Van Hoef B. Schlott B. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Cederholm-Williams S.A., De Cock F. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Eur. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27912-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which is mediated in large part through the SK β-domain (20Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami S.B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Rodriguez P. Fuentes P. Barro M. Alvarez J.G. Munoz E. Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Eur. J.

Verhamme I.M. Bernardo M.M. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The fact that SKβswap activated Glu-Pg by a staphylokinase mechanism suggested that it might not form a tight stable complex with Glu-Pg like SK. However, the affinity of Glu-Pg for SKβswap was comparable with or better than the affinity of Glu-Pg for SK (Fig. 2). This finding suggests that high affinity binding of SK perhaps is not sufficient for active site generation in Pg and that interactions among specific residues of the β-domain with the protease domain may be required for this process. Molecular modeling predicts that the SK β-domain has few significant intermolecular contacts (e.g. SK Glu218, Asp220, Asp238) with microplasmin (e.g.Arg582, Ser608, Arg610, and Ser612) in the activator complex. The primary sequence and structural alignments indicate that these residues and those mediating weaker interactions are not conserved between SK and SUPA. Molecular modeling studies have supported earlier biochemical studies indicating that the SK β-domain may be important for interactions of the activator complex with substrates and inhibitors (14Jespers L. Vanwetswinkel S. Lijnen H.R. Van Herzeele N. Van Hoef B. Demarsin E. Collen D. De Maeyer M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 44Parry M.A. Zhang X.C. Bode I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 53-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Despite their strong overall structural similarities, the replacement of the SK β-domain with the SUPA β-domain alters amidolytic and Pg activation kinetics. The affinity (1/Km) of the SKβswap-plasmin complex for S2251 is 2-fold higher than that of SK-plasmin activator complex. The affinity of the SKβswap-plasmin complex for human Pg is ∼6-fold higher than that of SK-plasmin activator complex, although the overall catalytic efficiency was unchanged. In addition, the β-domain also appears to modulate the interaction of the activator complex with covalent and noncovalent inhibitors. The SKβswap-plasmin activator complex was more readily inhibited by α2-antiplasmin, the physiologically important regulator of plasmin, than the SK-plasmin activator complex (Fig. 4A). The effects were most pronounced with SBTI, a reversible protease inhibitor. SBTI had no effect on the hydrolysis of SK-human plasmin activator complex (45Reddy K.N. Cercek B. Lew A.S. Ganz W. Thromb. Res. 1986; 41: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). However, SKβswap-plasmin activator complex and plasmin were completely inhibited by SBTI under these experimental conditions (Fig 4B). Taken together, these data suggest that the β-domain structure determines the interactions of the activator complex with small molecular weight and large physiologic substrates as well as with protein inhibitors. Previous studies have indicated that the β-domain of SK plays a critical role in forming a high affinity stable complex with P(g) (20Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami S.B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Conejero-Lara F. Parrado J. Azuaga A.I. Dobson C.M. Ponting C.P.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16879-16885Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although these interactions are not appreciated in the recent crystal structure with microplasmin (8Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided strong evidence for functional interactions of SK with the kringle domains in the activator complex and substrate. Indeed, the activator complex formation with full-length Pg occurs through a kringle-dependent mechanism (25Lin L.F. Houng A. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4740-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 42Loy J.A. Lin X. Schenone M. Castellino F.J. Zhang X.C. Tang J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14686-14695Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that the minimal activator complex of SK-microplasmin preferentially activates the kringle containing Glu-Pg substrate with a catalytic efficiency that is 24-fold greater than the kringleless micro-Pg substrate. In contrast, the SKβswap-microplasmin complex activates Glu-Pg and micro-Pg with efficiencies that are comparable (within 2-fold) to each other (Table II) and to the activation of micro-Pg substrate by the SK-microplasmin complex (Table II). However, the SK-microplasmin complex has a significantly higher (8-fold) activator activity than the SK-plasmin complex toward Glu-Pg (Table II), whereas the SKβswap-microplasmin complex activates Glu-Pg substrate 7-fold less efficiently than the SKβswap-plasmin complex. Taken together, these kinetic results indicate that kringles not only in the Pg substrate structure but also in the structure of Pg activator complex may also influence the efficiency of Pg activation in part through a β-domain-dependent mechanism."
