Khorasaninejad et al. show that arrays of nanoscale fins of TiO can function as high-end optical lenses. At just a fraction of the size of optical objectives, such planar devices could turn your phone camera or your contact lens into a compound microscope. Maguid et al. interleaved sparse 2D arrays of metal antennas to get multifunctional behavior from the one planar device structure (see the Perspective by Litchinitser). The enhanced functionality of such designed metasurfaces could be used in sensing applications or to increase the communication capacity of nanophotonic networks.

We characterize the class 2 type VI CRISPR-Cas effector C2c2 and demonstrate its RNA-guided ribonuclease function. C2c2 from the bacterium Leptotrichia shahii provides interference against RNA phage. In vitro biochemical analysis shows that C2c2 is guided by a single CRISPR RNA and can be programmed to cleave single-stranded RNA targets carrying complementary protospacers. In bacteria, C2c2 can be programmed to knock down specific mRNAs. Cleavage is mediated by catalytic residues in the two conserved Higher Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes Nucleotide-binding (HEPN) domains, mutations of which generate catalytically inactive RNA-binding proteins. These results broaden our understanding of CRISPR-Cas systems and suggest that C2c2 can be used to develop new RNA-targeting tools."

Industrial mimics of photosynthesis seek to convert CO 2 directly into biomass, fuels, or other useful products. Improving on a previous artificial photosynthesis design, Liu et al. combined the hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium Raistonia eutropha with a cobalt-phosphorus water-splitting catalyst. This biocompatible self-healing electrode circumvented the toxicity challenges of previous designs and allowed it to operate aerobically. When combined with solar photovoltaic cells, solar-to-chemical conversion rates should become nearly an order of magnitude more efficient than natural photosynthesis. Science , this issue p. 1210"

However, the amounts of RNA generated at any one time-point have been difficult to determine. Schwalb et al. developed a method, transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-Seq), to collect and sequence all RNA segments synthesized over 5 minutes. Because 5 minutes is not long enough to fully degrade even the most transient RNA, this method can detect the synthesis of most RNA without bias. Applying this method to human K562 cells, TT-Seq detected thousands of noncoding transcripts, providing a snapshot of RNA synthesis rates and RNA half-lives, and full-length maps of short-lived RNAs such as enhancers and short intergenic noncoding RNAs.

https://openalex.org/W2409075447,"Location matters for immunosuppression In the gut, food antigens and resident microbes can trigger unwanted immune responses. Immunosuppressive cell types in the gut, such as regulatory T cells (T regs ) and intraepithelial T lymphocytes (IELs), help to keep these responses at bay. Sujino et al. report that the specific anatomical location within the gut shapes the properties of the suppressive T cell populations that reside there (see the Perspective by Colonna and Cervantes-Barragan). Using mice, they find that T regs primarily reside in the lamina propria. T regs migrate to the intestinal epithelium, where they convert to IELs in a process that depends on the microbiota and the loss of a specific transcription factor. T regs and IELs also play distinct but complementary roles in suppressing intestinal inflammation. Science , this issue p. 1581 ; see also p. 1515"

This chromatin must be remodeled to allow gene transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair machineries access to the enclosed DNA. Chromatin-remodeling complexes require high levels of cellular energy to do their job. Wright et al. show that the energy needed to remodel chromatin can be derived from a source, poly-ADP-ribose, in the cell nucleus, rather than by diffusion of ATP from mitochondria in the cytoplasm, the usual powerhouse of the cell. Poly-ADP-ribose is converted to ADP-ribose and then to ATP, which can be used to fuel chromatin remodeling within the nucleus. Science , this issue p. 1221"
https://openalex.org/W2409330163,"“Vaccine hesitancy” is a concept now frequently used in vaccination discourse. The increased popularity of this concept in both academic and public health circles is challenging previously held perspectives that individual vaccination attitudes and behaviours are a simple dichotomy of accept or reject. A consultation study was designed to assess the opinions of experts and health professionals concerning the definition, scope, and causes of vaccine hesitancy in Canada. We sent online surveys to two panels (1- vaccination experts and 2- front-line vaccine providers). Two questionnaires were completed by each panel, with data from the first questionnaire informing the development of questions for the second. Our participants defined vaccine hesitancy as an attitude (doubts, concerns) as well as a behaviour (refusing some / many vaccines, delaying vaccination). Our findings also indicate that both vaccine experts and front-line vaccine providers have the perception that vaccine rates have been declining and consider vaccine hesitancy an important issue to address in Canada. Diffusion of negative information online and lack of knowledge about vaccines were identified as the key causes of vaccine hesitancy by the participants. A common understanding of vaccine hesitancy among researchers, public health experts, policymakers and health care providers will better guide interventions that can more effectively address vaccine hesitancy within Canada."

However, HRQL following treatment has never previously been assessed in longitudinal descriptive studies using validated instruments.To investigate disease-specific (ThyPRO) and generic (SF-36) HRQL, following levothyroxine therapy in patients with hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis.This prospective cohort study was set at endocrine outpatient clinics at two Danish university hospitals. Seventy-eight consecutive patients were enrolled and completed HRQL questionnaires before, six weeks, and six months after initiation of levothyroxine therapy. Normative ThyPRO (n = 739) and SF-36 (n = 6,638) data were available for comparison and changes in HRQL following treatment were estimated and quantified.Prior to treatment, all ThyPRO scales were significantly impacted (p<0.0001), compared to the general population sample. The same was observed for seven of eight SF-36 scales, the exception being Bodily Pain. Tiredness (ThyPRO) and Vitality (SF-36) were the most markedly impacted scales. After six weeks of treatment, nine of thirteen ThyPRO scales had significantly improved. ThyPRO improvements were consistent at six months, where five of eight SF-36 scales had also significantly improved, but deficits persisted for a subset of both ThyPRO and SF-36 scales.In this population of hypothyroid patients, HRQL was widely affected before treatment, with tiredness as the cardinal impairment according to both ThyPRO and SF-36. Many aspects of HRQL improved during the first six months of LT4 therapy, but full recovery was not obtained. Our results may help clinicians inform patients about expected clinical treatment effects."

Liver fibrosis leads to liver cirrhosis, a common cause of death worldwide (Hoyert and Xu, 2012Hoyert D.L. Xu J. Deaths: preliminary data for 2011.Natl. Vital Stat.

In the United States alone, liver cirrhosis affects more than 600,000 patients (Scaglione et al., 2015Scaglione S. Kliethermes S. Cao G. Shoham D. Durazo R. Luke A. Volk M.L.

The only available cure is liver transplantation. Liver cell therapy is ineffective because of impaired engraftment (Hughes et al., 2012Hughes R.D. Mitry R.R. Dhawan A. Current status of hepatocyte transplantation.Transplantation. 2012; 93: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The shortage of donor livers means only 6,000 patients benefit from this therapy and more than 35,000 patients die in the United States every year (Kim et al., 2014Kim W.R. Smith J.M.

The biology of liver fibrosis has been studied extensively (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin.

Models of liver fibrosis: exploring the dynamic nature of inflammation and repair in a solid organ.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Liver fibrosis is a repair mechanism that maintains the integrity of the injured liver through deposition of extracellular matrices such as collagen. Persistent liver injury causes collagen accumulation, which suppresses hepatocyte function and restricts intrahepatic blood flow, leading to liver failure, portal hypertension, and liver cancer (Liu et al., 2012Liu L. Yannam G.R. Nishikawa T. Yamamoto T. Basma H. Ito R. Nagaya M. Dutta-Moscato J. Stolz D.B.

Friedman S.L. Fibrosis-dependent mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis.Hepatology. 2012; 56: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Most of the collagen is produced by myofibroblasts (MFs), a mesenchymal liver cell type generated in large numbers by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) or portal fibroblasts when they become activated in response to liver injury (Iwaisako et al., 2014Iwaisako K. Jiang C. Zhang M. Cong M. Moore-Morris T.J. Park T.J. Liu X. Xu J. Wang P. Paik Y.H. et al.Origin of myofibroblasts in the fibrotic liver in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Fate tracing reveals hepatic stellate cells as dominant contributors to liver fibrosis independent of its aetiology.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Because MFs are essential for liver fibrosis development and progression, we reasoned that in vivo reprogramming of MFs into hepatocytes would be effective as a therapy for liver fibrosis by replenishing the hepatocyte mass and limiting collagen production. For this, we built on previous studies of in vitro reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into induced hepatocytes (iHeps) by lentiviral or retroviral expression of the hepatic transcription factor (TF) genes Foxa3, Gata4, and Hnf1a (Huang et al., 2011Huang P. He Z. Ji S. Sun H. Xiang D. Liu C. Hu Y. Wang X. Hui L. Induction of functional hepatocyte-like cells from mouse fibroblasts by defined factors.Nature. 2011; 475: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) or Foxa1/Foxa2/Foxa3 and Hnf4a (Sekiya and Suzuki, 2011Sekiya S. Suzuki A. Direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells by defined factors.Nature. 2011; 475: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), respectively. A prerequisite for clinical translation of in vivo reprogramming strategies is that delivery of TFs to the targeted cells is both efficient and safe (Addis and Epstein, 2013Addis R.C. Epstein J.A. Induced regeneration—the progress and promise of direct reprogramming for heart repair.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Heinrich et al., 2015Heinrich C. Spagnoli F.M. Berninger B. In vivo reprogramming for tissue repair.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We therefore explored the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, which have emerged as a safe and effective tool for gene delivery—including in clinical trials of liver-directed gene therapy of hemophilia B (Nathwani et al., 2011Nathwani A.C. Tuddenham E.G. Rangarajan S. Rosales C. McIntosh J. Linch D.C. Chowdary P. Riddell A. Pie A.J. Harrington C. et al.Adenovirus-associated virus vector-mediated gene transfer in hemophilia B.N. Engl.

Med. 2014; 371: 1994-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar)—because they do not integrate into the genome or exhibit the strong immunogenicity that has hampered adenoviral vectors (Crystal, 2014Crystal R.G. Adenovirus: the first effective in vivo gene delivery vector.Hum. Gene Ther. 2014; 25: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Because AAV capsids with MF tropism were unknown, we performed a screen in the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) mouse model of liver fibrosis (Liedtke et al., 2013Liedtke C. Luedde T. Sauerbruch T.

After treating wild-type mice with 12 doses of CCl4, we intravenously injected them with 1 × 1011 viral genomes of an AAV-EYFP vector pseudotyped with one of the nine capsids and analyzed the mouse organs after seven additional doses of CCl4. Only AAV6 had a relevant MF tropism, transducing 10.2% ± 5.3% of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-positive MFs (Figures 1A and 1B ). Increasing the vector dose to 4 × 1011 viral genomes or intrahepatic injection increased the MF transduction efficiency to 23.6% ± 5.0% or 30.4% ± 4.36%, respectively (Figures 1B and 1C). At a dose of 4 × 1011 viral genomes, AAV6 also transduced 7.9% ± 7.15% of Kupffer cells and 1.2% ± 0.53% of hepatocytes, but did not transduce cholangiocytes or endothelial cells (Figures S1A and S1B, available online). Interestingly, the same AAV6 dose transduced only 2.3% ± 1.99% of desmin (DES)-positive HSCs in mice without liver injury (Figure S1C). As previously reported (Zincarelli et al., 2008Zincarelli C. Soltys S. Rengo G. Rabinowitz J.E. Analysis of AAV serotypes 1-9 mediated gene expression and tropism in mice after systemic injection.Mol. Ther. 2008; 16: 1073-1080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), intravenously injected AAV6 showed organ tropism for liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and spleen (Figure S1D). We used the AAV6 capsid to generate six AAV vectors expressing the TF genes Foxa1, Foxa2, Foxa3, Gata4, Hnf1a, or Hnf4a from the CMV promoter (combination referred to as AAV6-6TFs). To test the efficacy of AAV6-6TFs, we transduced MFs generated by in vitro activation of primary mouse HSCs, which produced clones of cells that lost most of their original identity and acquired hepatocyte gene expression and function (Figures S1E–S1J). To establish in vivo efficacy of AAV6-6TFs, we used a mouse model of MF fate tracing in which a constitutive reporter (R26R-ZsGreen) is activated by Cre recombinase expressed from the lecithin retinol acyltransferase (Lrat) promoter (Mederacke et al., 2013Mederacke I. Hsu C.C. Troeger J.S. Huebener P. Mu X. Dapito D.H. Pradere J.P. Schwabe R.F. Fate tracing reveals hepatic stellate cells as dominant contributors to liver fibrosis independent of its aetiology.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). We treated these mice with 12 doses of CCl4, intravenously injected them with 4 × 1011 viral genomes of AAV6-6TFs, and analyzed their livers 4 weeks later (CCl4 stop protocol). We found cells expressing the MF fate-tracing marker ZsGreen and the hepatocyte markers HNF4α, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), and major urinary protein (MUP) (Figures 2A and 2B ), suggesting they were iHeps derived from MFs (MF-iHeps). To confirm this finding, we determined the specificity and efficiency of MF labeling in Lrat-Cre;R26R-ZsGreen mice treated with 12 doses of CCl4. As previously reported (Mederacke et al., 2013Mederacke I. Hsu C.C. Troeger J.S. Huebener P. Mu X. Dapito D.H. Pradere J.P. Schwabe R.F. Fate tracing reveals hepatic stellate cells as dominant contributors to liver fibrosis independent of its aetiology.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), we found that most (92.8%) MFs and few (0.021%) hepatocytes were labeled in these mice (Figure S2A). We also excluded cell fusion as the mechanism of MF-iHep formation (Figure S2B). Because AAV6 also transduced Kupffer cells (Figures S1A and S1B), we tested AAV6-6TFs in LysM-Cre;R26R-ZsGreen Kupffer cell fate-tracing mice (Clausen et al., 1999Clausen B.E. Burkhardt C. Reith W. Renkawitz R. Förster I. Conditional gene targeting in macrophages and granulocytes using LysMcre mice.Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar) (Figure S2A), which showed rare (<0.01%) fate-traced hepatocytes after treatment with the CCl4 stop protocol (Figure S2C). Moreover, AAV6-6TFs induced very few cells expressing hepatocyte markers in skeletal muscle, heart, and spleen; none of these cells showed hepatocyte morphology (Figure S2D). Next, we determined the efficiency of hepatic reprogramming of MFs by AAV6-6TFs under different conditions of fibrotic liver injury. In accord with our finding of low transduction of HSCs, we found only baseline levels of labeled hepatocytes in mice not treated with CCl4 (Figures 2A and 2B). We found the most MF-iHeps—0.87% of all hepatocytes in the liver—in mice treated with 16 doses of CCl4 (Figures 2B and 2C). MF-iHeps were mostly single cells in these mice but clonally expanded in mice treated with 21 doses of CCl4, leading to a similar overall number of MF-iHeps despite a lower number of MF-iHep clones (Figure 2B). Findings were similar in mice in which we induced liver injury with 12 doses of CCl4 and reinstated it after a 2-week break with an additional 12 doses (recurring CCl4 protocol), and in mice continuously treated with CCl4—10 doses before and 12 doses after intravenous injection of AAV6-6TFs (continuous CCl4 protocol) (Figures 2A and 2B). We validated these results in mice with liver fibrosis due to steatohepatitis induced by continuous feeding of a choline-deficient ethionine-supplemented (CDE) diet (Knight et al., 2007Knight B.

These findings suggest that severe liver fibrosis and ongoing liver injury reduce the efficiency of hepatic reprogramming of MFs, most likely because collagen-engulfed MFs are less accessible to AAV vectors and because nonintegrating AAV vectors are lost from proliferating MFs (Li et al., 2011Li H. Haurigot V. Doyon Y. Li T. Wong S.Y. Bhagwat A.S. Malani N. Anguela X.M. Sharma R. Ivanciu L. et al.In vivo genome editing restores haemostasis in a mouse model of haemophilia.Nature. 2011; 475: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, Nakai et al., 2001Nakai H.

Virol. 2001; 75: 6969-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). However, these findings also show that MF-iHep proliferation can compensate for reduced MF-iHep formation. Prompted by our finding of clonal expansion of MF-iHeps, we determined whether MF-iHeps proliferate normally. For this, we compared clone size of MF-iHeps and primary hepatocytes between Lrat-Cre;R26R-ZsGreen mice treated with the recurring CCl4 protocol and R26R-ZsGreen mice receiving the same CCl4 treatment but intravenous injection of 2 × 1010 viral genomes of hepatocyte-targeted AAV8-Ttr-Cre vector to label hepatocytes at low frequency (Tarlow et al., 2014aTarlow B.D. Finegold M.J. Grompe M. Clonal tracing of Sox9+ liver progenitors in mouse oval cell injury.Hepatology. 2014; 60: 278-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We found a similar clone size distribution in MF-iHeps and primary hepatocytes (Figure S3A). Because nonintegrating AAV vectors are lost from proliferating cells (Li et al., 2011Li H. Haurigot V. Doyon Y. Li T. Wong S.Y. Bhagwat A.S. Malani N. Anguela X.M. Sharma R. Ivanciu L. et al.In vivo genome editing restores haemostasis in a mouse model of haemophilia.Nature. 2011; 475: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, Nakai et al., 2001Nakai H. Yant S.R. Storm T.A. Fuess S. Meuse L. Kay M.A. Extrachromosomal recombinant adeno-associated virus vector genomes are primarily responsible for stable liver transduction in vivo.J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6969-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), these results also suggested that MF-iHeps are stably reprogrammed. We confirmed this hypothesis by showing that AAV6-6TFs were present in newly formed MF-iHeps and absent in clonally expanded MF-iHeps isolated by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) (Figures S3B–S3D). To determine whether MF-iHeps acquire full hepatocyte differentiation, we profiled their global gene expression with microarrays. For this, we isolated MF-iHeps by LCM from Lrat-Cre;R26R-ZsGreen mice 4–10 weeks after treatment with 16 doses of CCl4 and intravenous injection of AAV6-6TFs. As controls, we used primary hepatocytes from the same mice and MFs from CCl4-treated littermates, isolated by LCM and FACS, respectively. We found that MF-iHeps closely resembled primary hepatocytes (Figures S3E). Few of the 908 significantly differentially expressed (p ≤ 0.025) genes were associated with hepatocyte differentiation, as illustrated by mostly normal expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes specific for immature or mature hepatocytes (Peng et al., 2012Peng L. Yoo B. Gunewardena S.S. Lu H. Klaassen C.D. Zhong X.B. RNA sequencing reveals dynamic changes of mRNA abundance of cytochromes P450 and their alternative transcripts during mouse liver development.Drug Metab. Dispos. 2012; 40: 1198-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Table S1; Figures 3A and 3C ). However, MF-iHeps expressed some genes associated with MF or HSC differentiation (Figures 3B and 3C), suggesting that they retained some original identity. Importantly, this MF/HSC memory was minimal and did not translate into impaired hepatocyte function, as evidenced by normal albumin secretion, CYP3A activity, and urea production in MF-iHeps isolated from Lrat-Cre;R26R-ZsGreen mice by FACS (Figures 3D–3F). To test the efficacy of our strategy in a model of chronic fibrotic liver injury, the most challenging clinical scenario, we used the continuous CCl4 protocol (Figure 2B). We found reduced liver fibrosis in AAV6-6TF recipients as assessed by Sirius red staining, αSMA immunofluorescence (IF), and hydroxyproline measurement (Figures 4A and 4B ). In addition, serum levels of the hepatocyte injury marker alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were reduced in these mice (Figure 4C). Findings were similar in mice continuously fed a CDE diet (Figures 2B and 4D–4F). Next, we defined the contribution of MF-iHeps to reduced liver fibrosis and injury. Because the number of Kupffer cell-derived hepatocytes induced by AAV6-6TFs was negligible (Figure S2C), we investigated the contribution of increased expression of hepatic TFs in hepatocytes (Nishikawa et al., 2015Nishikawa T. Bell A. Brooks J.M. Setoyama K. Melis M. Han B. Fukumitsu K. Handa K. Tian J. Kaestner K.H. et al.Resetting the transcription factor network reverses terminal chronic hepatic failure.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For this, we generated hepatocyte-targeted AAV8 vectors expressing the six TFs (AAV8-6TFs) and intravenously injected them—at a dose at which each of the six vectors transduced 1.2% of hepatocytes (Figure S1B; Table S2)—into mice treated with the continuous CCl4 protocol (Figure 2B). We found that liver fibrosis and injury were not significantly reduced in these mice (Figures S4A–S4C), although whole liver gene expression of fibrolytic MMP9 and MMP12 was increased (Ramachandran et al., 2012Ramachandran P. Pellicoro A. Vernon M.A. Boulter L. Aucott R.L. Ali A. Hartland S.N. Snowdon V.K. Cappon A. Gordon-Walker T.T. et al.Differential Ly-6C expression identifies the recruited macrophage phenotype, which orchestrates the regression of murine liver fibrosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E3186-E3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) (Figure S4D). We also used AAV8-6TFs to exclude unspecific activation of MF fate tracing in hepatocytes of Lrat-Cre;R26R-ZsGreen mice (Figure S4E). These results show that the therapeutic efficacy of our strategy is mainly due to hepatic reprogramming of MFs. To identify the essential TFs, we determined which of the six AAV6-TF vectors are enriched in newly formed MF-iHeps in vivo (Figure S4F). Based on this analysis and in vitro and in vivo validation, we arrived at FOXA3, GATA4, and HNF1α as the most effective minimal TF combination (Figures S4G–S4M). These findings accord with a previous study that used lentiviral vectors for hepatic reprogramming of fibroblasts in vitro, except that AAV6-mediated in vitro or in vivo hepatic reprogramming of MFs did not require p19 inactivation (Huang et al., 2011Huang P. He Z. Ji S. Sun H. Xiang D. Liu C. Hu Y. Wang X. Hui L. Induction of functional hepatocyte-like cells from mouse fibroblasts by defined factors.Nature. 2011; 475: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Finally, we established efficient transduction and hepatic reprogramming of primary human MFs with AAV6 vectors in vitro (Figures S4N–S4Q). Our study establishes the feasibility of in vivo reprogramming of MFs into fully functional hepatocytes using AAV vectors, a gene delivery tool that proved to be safe and effective in clinical trials of liver-directed gene therapy (Nathwani et al., 2011Nathwani A.C. Tuddenham E.G. Rangarajan S. Rosales C. McIntosh J. Linch D.C. Chowdary P. Riddell A. Pie A.J. Harrington C. et al.Adenovirus-associated virus vector-mediated gene transfer in hemophilia B.N. Engl.

To develop this strategy into a therapy for patients with liver fibrosis, the number of MFs that express the essential TFs needs to be increased. To maximize the efficacy of the wild-type AAV6 capsid, the essential TFs could be delivered with one vector, which would be feasible if a short promoter, self-cleaving 2A peptides, and a synthetic poly(A) signal are used (Ostedgaard et al., 2005Ostedgaard L.S. Rokhlina T. Karp P.H. Lashmit P. Afione S. Schmidt M. Zabner J. Stinski M.F. Chiorini J.A. Welsh M.J. A shortened adeno-associated virus expression cassette for CFTR gene transfer to cystic fibrosis airway epithelia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 2952-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, the MF transduction efficiency could be improved, which, as illustrated by our findings made after intrahepatic vector injection, could be achieved by detargeting AAV6 from extrahepatic cells. For this, technologies like AAV capsid DNA shuffling or peptide display could be used (Grimm et al., 2008Grimm D. Lee J.S. Wang L. Desai T. Akache B. Storm T.A. Kay M.A. In vitro and in vivo gene therapy vector evolution via multispecies interbreeding and retargeting of adeno-associated viruses.J.

Kay M.A. Selection and evaluation of clinically relevant AAV variants in a xenograft liver model.Nature. 2014; 506: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). As a safety measure, residual extrahepatic TF expression could be prevented by tagging with target sequences of tissue-specific microRNAs (Xie et al., 2011Xie J. Xie Q. Zhang H. Ameres S.L. Hung J.H. Su Q. He R. Mu X. Seher Ahmed S. Park S. et al.MicroRNA-regulated, systemically delivered rAAV9: a step closer to CNS-restricted transgene expression.Mol. Ther. 2011; 19: 526-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Further aided by the ability of MF-iHeps to expand in response to liver injury, our strategy of repurposing MFs has potential as a therapy for liver fibrosis, addressing both insufficient hepatocyte function and collagen accumulation. All procedures involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, San Francisco. All mice were housed under barrier conditions. Wild-type mice and mice heterozygous for Lrat-Cre (Mederacke et al., 2013Mederacke I. Hsu C.C. Troeger J.S. Huebener P. Mu X. Dapito D.H. Pradere J.P. Schwabe R.F.

Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar) were used. All mice were C57BL/6 and 5–16 weeks old. Littermates and male and female mice were equally distributed between experimental and control groups. Mice were not randomized and investigators were not blinded. Mice received intraperitoneal injections of 0.5 μL/g body weight CCl4 diluted 1:4 in corn oil (both Sigma-Aldrich) every 2 days. Livers were analyzed 2 or 3 days after the last CCl4 dose. Alternatively, mice were fed a diet deficient in choline (MP Biomedicals) supplemented with 0.15% (w/v) ethionine (Sigma-Aldrich) in drinking water. AAV vectors were produced in HEK293T cells (Agilent Technologies) and purified using iodixanol (Sigma-Aldrich) density gradients (Zolotukhin et al., 1999Zolotukhin S. Byrne B.J. Mason E. Zolotukhin I. Potter M. Chesnut K. Summerford C. Samulski R.J. Muzyczka N. Recombinant adeno-associated virus purification using novel methods improves infectious titer and yield.Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 973-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). To reduce iodixanol thickness for intravenous injection, AAV vectors were diluted in PBS/5% sorbitol at a ratio of 5:1. AAV vectors were also produced by Virovek in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system (Chen, 2008Chen H. Intron splicing-mediated expression of AAV Rep and Cap genes and production of AAV vectors in insect cells.Mol. Ther. 2008; 16: 924-930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). AAV vectors from Virovek were purified using cesium chloride gradients and diluted in PBS containing 0.001% pluronic F-68 (Sigma-Aldrich) for intravenous injection. Mice were intravenously injected via the tail vein with 4 × 1011 viral genomes of each vector unless otherwise specified. Vector injections were performed slowly, and the volume was limited to 300 μL for tail vein injection and 50 μL for intrahepatic injection. The percentage of MF-iHep clones (single cells or nodules) of all hepatocytes in the liver is the hepatic reprogramming efficiency. The total number of hepatocytes per 10× field in a liver section was determined by FAH immunofluorescence and DAPI staining. After correcting for hepatocyte-free areas in a field, e.g., blood vessels and mesenchyme, MF-iHep clones were quantified in >2,000 hepatocytes per mouse in randomly taken 10× images of ≥2 liver sections from ≥2 liver lobes. MF-iHep clones were identified by co-expression of ZsGreen and FAH. The percentage of all MF-iHeps of all hepatocytes in the liver is the extent of liver repopulation. Data are expressed as means ± SEM or SD. Statistical differences between experimental and control groups were determined by Student’s t test (unpaired, two-tailed) unless otherwise specified. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Prism 6.0 (Graphpad) was used for statistical analyses. H.W. conceived the project.

Wu et al. observed related behavior in a three-dimensional metal, Yb 2 Pt 2 Pb, where the Yb ions have a large magnetic moment that has its origin in the electrons' orbital motion rather than their spin. Neutron-scattering measurements indicated that these large magnetic moments can flip their direction through an exchange process similar to the one that occurs in spin 1/2 systems. This process results in effective charge-orbital separation. Science , this issue p. 1206"
https://openalex.org/W2410049725,"The dominant evolutionary theory of physical attraction posits that attractiveness reflects physiological health, and attraction is a mechanism for identifying a healthy mate. Previous studies have found that perceptions of the healthiest body mass index (weight scaled for height; BMI) for women are close to healthy BMI guidelines, while the most attractive BMI is significantly lower, possibly pointing to an influence of sociocultural factors in determining attractive BMI. However, less is known about ideal body size for men. Further, research has not addressed the role of body fat and muscle, which have distinct relationships with health and are conflated in BMI, in determining perceived health and attractiveness. Here, we hypothesised that, if attractiveness reflects physiological health, the most attractive and healthy appearing body composition should be in line with physiologically healthy body composition. Thirty female and 33 male observers were instructed to manipulate 15 female and 15 male body images in terms of their fat and muscle to optimise perceived health and, separately, attractiveness. Observers were unaware that they were manipulating the muscle and fat content of bodies. The most attractive apparent fat mass for female bodies was significantly lower than the healthiest appearing fat mass (and was lower than the physiologically healthy range), with no significant difference for muscle mass. The optimal fat and muscle mass for men's bodies was in line with the healthy range. Male observers preferred a significantly lower overall male body mass than did female observers. While the body fat and muscle associated with healthy and attractive appearance is broadly in line with physiologically healthy values, deviations from this pattern suggest that future research should examine a possible role for internalization of body ideals in influencing perceptions of attractive body composition, particularly in women."

https://openalex.org/W2412779503,"In humans, insulin sensitivity varies according to time of day, with decreased values in the evening and at night. Mechanisms responsible for the diurnal variation in insulin sensitivity are unclear. We investigated whether human adipose tissue (AT) expresses intrinsic circadian rhythms in insulin sensitivity that could contribute to this phenomenon. Subcutaneous and visceral AT biopsies were obtained from extremely obese participants (body mass index, 41.8 ± 6.3 kg/m(2); 46 ± 11 y) during gastric-bypass surgery. To assess the rhythm in insulin signaling, AKT phosphorylation was determined every 4 h over 24 h in vitro in response to different insulin concentrations (0, 1, 10, and 100 nM). Data revealed that subcutaneous AT exhibited robust circadian rhythms in insulin signaling (P < 0.00001). Insulin sensitivity reached its maximum (acrophase) around noon, being 54% higher than during midnight (P = 0.009). The amplitude of the rhythm was positively correlated with in vivo sleep duration (r = 0.53; P = 0.023) and negatively correlated with in vivo bedtime (r = -0.54; P = 0.020). No circadian rhythms were detected in visceral AT (P = 0.643). Here, we demonstrate the relevance of the time of the day for how sensitive AT is to the effects of insulin. Subcutaneous AT shows an endogenous circadian rhythm in insulin sensitivity that could provide an underlying mechanism for the daily rhythm in systemic insulin sensitivity.-Carrasco-Benso, M. P., Rivero-Gutierrez, B., Lopez-Minguez, J., Anzola, A., Diez-Noguera, A., Madrid, J. A., Lujan, J. A., Martínez-Augustin, O., Scheer, F. A. J. L., Garaulet, M.

https://openalex.org/W2464896206,"Atherosclerotic lesions are lipometabolic disorder characterized by chronic progressive inflammation in arterial walls. Previous studies have shown that macrophage-derived lipoprotein lipase (LPL) might be a key factor that promotes atherosclerosis by accelerating lipid accumulation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Increasing evidence indicates that microRNA-27 (miR-27) has beneficial effects on lipid metabolism and inflammatory response. However, it has not been fully understood whether miR-27 affects the expression of LPL and subsequent development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE KO) mice. To address these questions and its potential mechanisms, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-treated THP-1 macrophages were transfected with the miR-27 mimics/inhibitors and apoE KO mice fed high-fat diet were given a tail vein injection with miR-27 agomir/antagomir, followed by exploring the potential roles of miR-27. MiR-27 agomir significantly down-regulated LPL expression in aorta and peritoneal macrophages by western blot and real-time PCR analyses. We performed LPL activity assay in the culture media and found that miR-27 reduced LPL activity. ELISA showed that miR-27 reduced inflammatory response as analyzed in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our results showed that miR-27 had an inhibitory effect on the levels of lipid both in plasma and in peritoneal macrophages of apoE KO mice as examined by HPLC. Consistently, miR-27 suppressed the expression of scavenger receptors associated with lipid uptake in ox-LDL-treated THP-1 macrophages. In addition, transfection with LPL siRNA inhibited the miR-27 inhibitor-induced lipid accumulation and proinflammatory cytokines secretion in ox-LDL-treated THP-1 macrophages. Finally, systemic treatment revealed that miR-27 decreased aortic plaque size and lipid content in apoE KO mice. The present results provide evidence that a novel antiatherogenic role of miR-27 was closely related to reducing lipid accumulation and inflammatory response via downregulation of LPL gene expression, suggesting a potential strategy to the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2417657804,"Movement is a key spatiotemporal process that enables interactions between animals and other elements of nature. The understanding of animal trajectories and the mechanisms that influence them at the landscape level can yield insight into ecological processes and potential solutions to specific ecological problems. Based upon optimal foraging models and empirical evidence, we hypothesized that movement by thrushes is highly tortuous (low average movement speeds and homogeneous distribution of turning angles) inside forests, moderately tortuous in urban areas, which present intermediary levels of resources, and minimally tortuous (high movement speeds and turning angles next to 0 radians) in open matrix types (e.g., crops and pasture). We used data on the trajectories of two common thrush species (Turdus rufiventris and Turdus leucomelas) collected by radio telemetry in a fragmented region in Brazil. Using a maximum likelihood model selection approach we fit four probability distribution models to average speed data, considering short-tailed, long-tailed, and scale-free distributions (to represent different regimes of movement variation), and one distribution to relative angle data. Models included land cover type and distance from forest-matrix edges as explanatory variables. Speed was greater farther away from forest edges and increased faster inside forest habitat compared to urban and open matrices. However, turning angle was not influenced by land cover. Thrushes presented a very tortuous trajectory, with many displacements followed by turns near 180 degrees. Thrush trajectories resembled habitat and edge dependent, tortuous random walks, with a well-defined movement scale inside each land cover type. Although thrushes are habitat generalists, they showed a greater preference for forest edges, and thus may be considered edge specialists. Our results reinforce the importance of studying animal movement patterns in order to understand ecological processes such as seed dispersal in fragmented areas, where the percentage of remaining habitat is dwindling."
https://openalex.org/W2411825724,"Human pluripotent stem cell differentiation protocols based on mimicking developmental pathways are getting close to generating fully fledged pancreatic endocrine cells, including insulin-producing beta cells. However, challenges remain in identifying pathways to trigger the attainment of robust glucose responsiveness that occurs postnatally in beta cells. Human pluripotent stem cell differentiation protocols based on mimicking developmental pathways are getting close to generating fully fledged pancreatic endocrine cells, including insulin-producing beta cells. However, challenges remain in identifying pathways to trigger the attainment of robust glucose responsiveness that occurs postnatally in beta cells. Diabetes treatment strategies may soon benefit from advances in the stem cell field. There are >400 million people suffering from this debilitating disease, and it threatens to cripple health care budgets. At its heart is inadequate production of the hormone insulin from specialized endocrine cells called beta cells, which are found in islets of Langerhans, scattered throughout the pancreas. While beta cells are the predominant cell type in islets, these clusters also contain other endocrine cells, including glucagon-producing alpha cells. The adult human pancreas has about three million islets, each with a few thousand cells. This amounts to about 2 mL volume, 2 g of tissue, or 1%–2% of the total pancreas. Interestingly, the size (100–200 μm) and composition of the islets are remarkably conserved across species, suggesting that islets exist as an optimal functional unit. These tiny mini-organs are masterful at regulating blood sugar levels. Following a meal, absorbed nutrients and gut-derived incretin hormones stimulate rapid and robust secretion of insulin from large pre-manufactured reservoirs in beta cells. Insulin promotes trafficking of glucose transporters to cell membranes so glucose can enter cells and be used as an energy source. During fasting periods, insulin production diminishes, while alpha cells release glucagon, instructing the liver to produce sufficient glucose to sustain energy needs. The coordinated release of insulin and glucagon from the pancreatic islets ensures that there are minimal fluctuations in blood glucose levels. Loss or impaired function of beta cells leads to chronic hyperglycemia and diabetes. In severe form, patients rely upon exogenous insulin therapy, typically delivered multiple times per day by needle injection. While life sustaining, this therapy is arduous and prone to complications since it is virtually impossible to mimic the dynamic changes in insulin production from beta cells. As a result, patients often end up with damage to fine nerve endings and blood vessels, in the long term contributing to nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, and heart disease. An elegant solution to diabetes would be to replenish the mass of beta cells. Tremendous research is underway to develop methods to promote the expansion of pre-existing beta cells, or the fate conversion of other pancreatic cells into beta cells, but thus far this has not been successfully achieved with a clinically relevant approach. An alternative is to simply transplant beta cells. Clinical success has been achieved by infusing purified islets into the portal vein, whereby they lodge within small vessels in the liver and produce insulin in a regulated manner. Patients with labile diabetes can be rendered insulin free for years by this approach, with restoration of excellent glucose homeostasis and halting of the progression of diabetic complications. Notably, the results of several clinical studies seem to suggest that only a fraction of the normal beta cell mass, perhaps 10%–20%, can significantly improve glycemic control, reduce complications, and improve quality of life. Therefore, the clinical path for the effective treatment, and possibly even a cure, of diabetes has now been proven, and just requires a few teaspoons of cells per patient. The current reliance on organ donors for the islet cells, graft failure experienced by many recipients, and the need for chronic immunosuppression to protect the transplanted cells from immune attack currently limit the widespread adoption of this approach. With human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a virtually unlimited cell supply can be achieved. The pluripotent nature of stem cells means they have the capacity to form any of the ∼200 cell types in the body. Therefore, it must be possible to generate large quantities of islet cells from pluripotent stem cells, and this is something the field has been intensely working on. The cells are also readily amenable to genetic engineering, for instance, to correct a disease causing mutation in cells derived from a patient; increase the cells’ durability and resistance to stress; and enhance the cell preparation’s safety profile with so-called kill switches. Ultimately, if systemic immunosuppression is to be avoided, some form of immune protection will be required to overcome the alloimmune response to foreign cells (unless patient-specific iPSCs are used) as well as the beta cell autoimmunity characteristic of type 1 diabetes. This may be achieved by encapsulating the cells behind a barrier, ideally in retrievable devices optimized to support graft function in specific transplant sites. Genetic engineering strategies may also be applied to confer immune-privilege status and perhaps even to make a universal donor line. Initial attempts to produce beta cells from human stem cells relied upon spontaneous differentiation, as occurs in embryoid bodies (Assady et al., 2001Assady S. Maor G. Amit M. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Skorecki K.L. Tzukerman M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). While an important proof of concept, this approach suffered from lack of sufficient control over the differentiation process and significant cell impurity. Not unlike in other stem cell fields, the most success for producing islet cells from pluripotent human stem cells has come from approaches that mimic normal pancreas development. Fortunately, the way in which the pancreatic endocrine cells develop in humans is much like that of lower organisms such as mice and zebrafish, where much of the key signaling pathways have been unraveled. NovoCell (now ViaCyte) was early to capitalize upon this knowledge, developing robust protocols for the step-wise differentiation of human ESCs through the stages of definitive endoderm, primitive gut tube, posterior foregut, and pancreatic endoderm (Kroon et al., 2008Kroon E. Martinson L.A. Kadoya K. Bang A.G. Kelly O.G. Eliazer S. Young H. Richardson M. Smart N.G. Cunningham J. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). Many other groups have also successfully followed this approach, which involves exposing the cells to various growth factors and small molecules in a specific dose and sequence to differentiate the population of cells as uniformly as possible, a process that takes ∼2 weeks. The expression patterns of various proteins are used as guideposts along the way, leading to cells enriched for the transcription factors PDX1 and NKX6.1. These two transcription factors are co-expressed in multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells that give rise to all adult pancreatic endoderm cells. Studies using transplantation of human fetal pancreas tissues confirm that cells at this stage of development can form mature pancreatic islet cells. Therefore, at this stage of differentiation the cell fate is sufficiently determined such that the cells can be transplanted into a variety of ectopic sites and allowed to further mature into pancreatic endocrine cells in vivo over 3–4 months (Kroon et al., 2008Kroon E. Martinson L.A. Kadoya K. Bang A.G. Kelly O.G. Eliazer S. Young H. Richardson M. Smart N.G. Cunningham J. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). In recipient mice, the mature cells produce sufficient human insulin to reverse diabetes (Rezania et al., 2012Rezania A. Bruin J.E. Riedel M.J. Mojibian M. Asadi A. Xu J. Gauvin R. Narayan K. Karanu F. O’Neil J.J. et al.Diabetes. 2012; 61: 2016-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Importantly, the cell differentiations can be accomplished with scalable methods to produce highly enriched cell populations with minimal off-target cells or undifferentiated cells that could be teratoma forming (Schulz et al., 2012Schulz T.C. Young H.Y. Agulnick A.D. Babin M.J. Baetge E.E. Bang A.G. Bhoumik A. Cepa I. Cesario R.M. Haakmeester C. et al.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e37004Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cells mature and function within thin macro-encapsulation devices that are designed for simple subcutaneous transplant and to protect the cells from immune attack (Bruin et al., 2013Bruin J.E. Rezania A. Xu J. Narayan K. Fox J.K. O’Neil J.J. Kieffer T.J. Diabetologia. 2013; 56: 1987-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Based on the compelling small animal data and given the lack of a suitable immunodeficient large animal model, regulatory agencies in the United States and Canada approved ViaCyte to enter into clinical trials with this approach (https://clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT02239354). Patients in cohort 1 are receiving cells within two 250 μL sized devices and multiple 20 μL sentinel devices that are removed at interim time points to assess cell survival and function. While full results have not yet been released, viable and differentiated insulin-producing cells have been reported within a sentinel device retrieved ∼12 weeks post-transplant. These are encouraging preliminary findings that are cause for optimism and continued pursuit of this approach. A potential caveat of transplanting stem-cell-derived pancreatic progenitor cells is that the patients will be required to carefully monitor blood glucose levels and adjust exogenous insulin dosing accordingly as the cells mature and start producing insulin. This should not be a hardship to most insulin-dependent diabetics as they are accustomed to adjusting insulin doses. However, keeping the cells on track as they mature will be key to the success of this approach. It is possible that variables in the milieu of the transplanted progenitor cells, patient health status, medications, etc. could impact cell differentiation, resulting in off-target cells. For example, we recently discovered that hypothyroidism impairs maturation of pancreatic progenitor cells in mice, resulting in disrupted glucose-stimulated insulin production. We also observed different proportions of endocrine cells in grafts from pancreatic progenitors matured in mice versus rats. Also of potential concern is the relatively high basal insulin secretion that is characteristic of immature beta cells, such that transplant of excess immature cells could result in a period of inappropriately high basal insulin secretion and the risk of hypoglycemia. Therefore, there may be merit in maturing cells further in culture, prior to transplant. A trade-off with longer production periods is increased manufacturing costs. Although there are many claims of mature, glucose-responsive beta cells produced entirely in culture, the supporting evidence is not entirely persuasive. Why is it proving so difficult to differentiate pluripotent stem cells to mature beta cells in incubators? The answer may lie in the fact that we require more patience; after all, the natural process in humans takes >9 months. However, in smaller animals such as zebrafish, beta cells form and apparently mature within days, and it should be possible to replicate this process with human cells. The principal difficulty is that we still have gaps in our knowledge of how beta cells mature, such that we can’t deliberately mimic this process in culture. Beta cells first appear at 8–9 weeks post-conception in humans and even after a further 7 months of development are not mature. At birth they tend to secrete insulin in response to a lower glucose concentration than mature beta cells and are thus characterized by having high basal insulin output. The robust glucose-stimulated insulin responses distinguishing mature beta cells are only obtained during neonatal life. The initiation of feeding generating meal-dependent signals may be an important cue to mature beta cells, and some differentiation protocols incorporate exendin-4, an analog of the gut incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1. Thyroid hormone promotes postnatal beta cell development and glucose-responsive insulin secretion in the rat through the transcription factor MAFA (Aguayo-Mazzucato et al., 2013Aguayo-Mazzucato C. Zavacki A.M. Marinelarena A. Hollister-Lock J. El Khattabi I. Marsili A. Weir G.C. Sharma A. Larsen P.R. Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes. 2013; 62: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This insight has promoted the use of thyroid hormone in the latest protocols to improve the glucose responsiveness of cultivated cells, but deficits remain. Gene profiling studies have revealed distinct molecular signatures of neonatal compared to adult beta cells, and it is now clear that the creation of mature beta cells in which insulin secretion is tightly coupled to glucose concentrations requires the coordinated upregulation of certain genes and repression of others (Schuit et al., 2012Schuit F. Van Lommel L. Granvik M. Goyvaerts L. de Faudeur G. Schraenen A. Lemaire K. Diabetes. 2012; 61: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For example, glucose sensing by beta cells requires the expression of glucose transporters (GLUT1 in human beta cells) and a high Km hexokinase (glucokinase) to phosphorylate glucose for entry into glycolysis, such that protocols should strive to achieve co-expression of these proteins in insulin-positive cells. Low Km hexokinases are profoundly repressed in maturing beta cells to prevent insulin release in the fasting state, when circulating glucose levels are low. Indeed, aberrant expression of low Km hexokinase variant HK1 in human beta cells has been associated with a form of congenital hyperinsulinism. Stimulation of insulin secretion is normally directly coupled to glucose metabolism because glucose rapidly undergoes aerobic glycolysis in beta cells, leading to increased ATP levels that close ATP-sensitive K+ channels in the plasma membrane, causing cell depolarization, opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and Ca2+ influx, which triggers fusion of insulin-packed granules with the cell membrane and thereby release of insulin. Again, these key controllers must be present to ensure insulin secretion is acutely coupled to physiological changes in ambient glucose concentrations. In order to ensure that other metabolic fuels do not interfere with this process and trigger inappropriate insulin secretion, genes encoding SLC16A1 (also known as MCT1), which transports lactate and pyruvate across the plasma membrane, along with lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), which reduces pyruvate to lactate, are selectively silenced in beta cells (Schuit et al., 2012Schuit F. Van Lommel L. Granvik M. Goyvaerts L. de Faudeur G. Schraenen A. Lemaire K. Diabetes. 2012; 61: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The absence of anaerobic glycolysis ensures that pyruvate production and its subsequent entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is directly proportional to the postprandial rise in blood glucose. Ectopic expression of Ldha or Slc16a1 in mouse beta cells results in impaired insulin secretion, and mutations producing aberrant activity of SLC16A1 in human beta cells cause inappropriate insulin secretion and hypoglycemia during exercise. Because many studies generating insulin-producing cells with differentiated stem cells report elevated basal and poor glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, it is predictable that the cells produced are more akin to neonatal cells. Some progress has been made in identifying pathways involved in orchestrating the gene expression profiles characteristic of mature beta cells. For example, the ligand-dependent transcription factor estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ) has recently been identified as a driver of the oxidative metabolic gene network in mature beta cells (Yoshihara et al., 2016Yoshihara E. Wei Z. Lin C.S. Fang S. Ahmadian M. Kida Y. Tseng T. Dai Y. Yu R.T. Liddle C. et al.Cell Metab. 2016; 23: 622-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, promoting ERRγ expression and activity during stem cell differentiation could aid in attaining glucose-responsive beta cells from stem cells. A hallmark for transcriptional silencing is trimethylation of lysine27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), and this is highly enriched in the promoters of the disallowed genes in mature islets relative to other tissues, including ESCs and pancreatic progenitor cells. The methyltransferase activity of the Polycomb and the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A is key for the gene repression to enable the coupling of insulin secretion to glucose levels during beta cell maturation. Loss of Dnmt3a in mouse beta cells prevents this developmental metabolic programming, resulting in cells that resemble functionally immature neonatal beta cells, characterized by elevated basal insulin secretion that is insensitive to stimulation by glucose, in association with upregulated expression of hk1 and Ldha (Dhawan et al., 2015Dhawan S. Tschen S.I. Zeng C. Guo T. Hebrok M. Matveyenko A. Bhushan A. J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 2851-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the upstream signals promoting methyl transferase activity in beta cells will facilitate the repression of disallowed genes during differentiation of human stem cells. Advances in this field are continuing at a rapid pace, and it is predictable that protocols will be successfully refined to manufacture cells capable of dynamic, regulated insulin secretion on par with that of human beta cells. This is a worthwhile pursuit as it promises to lead to a source of cells capable of effectively reversing the symptoms of diabetes. These cells may never have the identical molecular signature of primary human beta cells, but it should be kept in mind that beta cells are a heterogeneous population, and functional mimicry is ultimately the goal when it comes to therapy. We should also keep in mind that the current state of the art for insulin replacement is injection of insulin analogs engineered in an attempt to facilitate mimicking the normal pattern of insulin delivery. There is considerable room for improvements. It will be interesting to determine whether the best approach for optimal function in vivo is with islet-like structures containing a mixture of cell types, or pure beta cells. More sophisticated culture systems are evolving that mimic organogenesis, for example, by incorporating endothelial cells, neuronal cells, and mesenchymal stem cells in four-dimensional stem cell culture systems whereby multiple progenitors communicate in a spatiotemporal manner as observed during in vivo organogenesis (Takebe et al., 2015Takebe T. Enomura M. Yoshizawa E. Kimura M. Koike H. Ueno Y. Matsuzaki T. Yamazaki T. Toyohara T. Osafune K. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 556-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Such approaches may create a better niche for mature beta cell development and give clues as to how to better produce pure populations of mature beta cells. Reproducibility, scale up, and economics will drive the use of synthetic small molecules as opposed to purified proteins and complex biological systems for cost-effective manufacturing using industrial processes. Collectively, efforts will eventually result in unlimited supplies of differentiated stem cells capable of performing much better, even if not identical in all respects to isolated natural beta cells. These cells will be a tremendous resource for understanding disease processes and drug screening, and potentially be a source of transplantable cells to treat diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2414426901,"Deinococcus radiodurans has a remarkable capacity to survive exposure to extreme levels of radiation that cause hundreds of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). DSB repair in this bacterium depends on its recombinase A protein (DrRecA). DrRecA plays a pivotal role in both extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing and slow crossover events of DSB repair during the organism's recovery from DNA damage. The mechanisms that control DrRecA activity during the D. radiodurans response to γ radiation exposure are unknown. Here, we show that DrRecA undergoes phosphorylation at Tyr-77 and Thr-318 by a DNA damage-responsive serine threonine/tyrosine protein kinase (RqkA). Phosphorylation modifies the activity of DrRecA in several ways, including increasing its affinity for dsDNA and its preference for dATP over ATP. Strand exchange reactions catalyzed by phosphorylated versus unphosphorylated DrRecA also differ. In silico analysis of DrRecA structure support the idea that phosphorylation can modulate crucial functions of this protein. Collectively, our findings suggest that phosphorylation of DrRecA enables the recombinase to selectively use abundant dsDNA substrate present during post-irradiation recovery for efficient DSB repair, thereby promoting the extraordinary radioresistance of D. radiodurans."
https://openalex.org/W2415697034,"Objective Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex auto-immune disease. Gene expression studies have been conducted to identify SLE-related genes in various types of samples. It is unknown whether there are common marker genes significant for SLE but independent of sample types, which may have potentials for follow-up translational research. The aim of this study is to identify common marker genes across various sample types for SLE. Methods Based on four public microarray gene expression datasets for SLE covering three representative types of blood-born samples (monocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell, PBMC; whole blood), we utilized three statistics (fold-change, FC; t-test p value; false discovery rate adjusted p value) to scrutinize genes simultaneously regulated with SLE across various sample types. For common marker genes, we conducted the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Protein-Protein Interaction analysis to gain insights into their functions. Results We identified 10 common marker genes associated with SLE (IFI6, IFI27, IFI44L, OAS1, OAS2, EIF2AK2, PLSCR1, STAT1, RNASE2, and GSTO1). Significant up-regulation of IFI6, IFI27, and IFI44L with SLE was observed in all the studied sample types, though the FC was most striking in monocyte, compared with PBMC and whole blood (8.82–251.66 vs. 3.73–74.05 vs. 1.19–1.87). Eight of the above 10 genes, except RNASE2 and GSTO1, interact with each other and with known SLE susceptibility genes, participate in immune response, RNA and protein catabolism, and cell death. Conclusion Our data suggest that there exist common marker genes across various sample types for SLE. The 10 common marker genes, identified herein, deserve follow-up studies to dissert their potentials as diagnostic or therapeutic markers to predict SLE or treatment response."

Methods Between January 2000 and May 2015, 145 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) underwent kidney transplantation. Of those, 40 (27.5%) underwent concurrent ipsilateral native nephrectomy (group NT). Patients in group NT were compared with patients with ADPKD not undergoing concurrent nephrectomy (group NT-) and asymptomatic patients undergoing pretransplant nephrectomy (group PNT). Results The average follow-up was 66 months. The graft survival rate at 1 and 5 years was 95% and 87.5% versus 93% and 76.2% in the NT and NT- groups, respectively (P = .903 and P = .544, respectively); 1-year patient survival was 100% for NT and 97% for NT- patients (P = .288), whereas 5-year patient survival was 100% and 92% for NT and NT- groups, respectively (P = .128). After propensity score matching (34 patients per group) no significant differences were observed in 1-year (97.1% in NT and 94.1%; P = 1) and 5-year (88.2% in NT and 91.2% in NT-; P = 1) graft survival, and in 1-year (100% for both groups; P = 1) and 5-year (100% in NT and 94.1% in NT-; P = 1) patient survival. Perioperative mortality was 0% among NT and 1.2% among NT- patients, whereas perioperative surgical complications were similar in both groups. One- and 5-year graft and patient survival were similar between the NT and PNT groups, but patients in the PNT group had significantly lower levels of hemoglobin and residual diuresis volumes at the time of transplant. Moreover, PNT patients had a longer pretransplant dialysis and a longer time on the waiting list. Conclusions Simultaneous unilateral nephrectomy does not have a negative effect on patient and graft survival in patients with ADPKD and is associated with low morbidity. Pretransplant nephrectomy should be restricted only to highly symptomatic patients, whereas unilateral nephrectomy in asymptomatic patients should be performed during kidney transplantation only if massive kidney size precludes graft positioning."
https://openalex.org/W2411841810,"TLRs are critical for innate immunity, but excessive activation can lead to tissue damage and disease. Specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), including resolvin D2 (RvD2), promote the active resolution of inflammation. How SPMs regulate early LPS signaling, including activation of TLR4, is unknown. We treated human THP-1 monocytic cells and primary human blood monocytes with RvD2 and LPS to evaluate modulation of TLRs. miRNA-146a overexpression and inhibition were used to dissect the mechanism of RvD2-mediated actions. We validated our studies using ELISAs for cytokines, PCR, Western blot analysis, and flow cytometry. Cells treated with 0.1% ethanol (control for RvD2) and/or PBS (control for LPS), and control microRNA mimics and inhibitors were used as controls. RvD2 reduced LPS-induced cytokines and TLR4 expression in human monocytes by up to 75%. In THP-1 cells, RvD2 reduced expression of TLR4, lymphocyte antigen 96 (MD-2), and downstream signals (MyD88, TRIF, and TAK1). These effects were partially mediated through RvD2 induction of microRNA-146a, and RvD2's actions were blocked by microRNA-146a inhibition. These new findings reveal the ability of RvD2 to reduce TLR4 expression and attenuate LPS-induced inflammation, providing a new area of SPM activity to investigate in this major area of therapeutic research.-Croasdell, A., Sime, P.

https://openalex.org/W2416078334,"Some blind people have developed a unique technique, called echolocation, to orient themselves in unknown environments. More specifically, by self-generating a clicking noise with the tongue, echolocators gain knowledge about the external environment by perceiving more detailed object features. It is not clear to date whether sighted individuals can also develop such an extremely useful technique. To investigate this, here we test the ability of novice sighted participants to perform a depth echolocation task. Moreover, in order to evaluate whether the type of room (anechoic or reverberant) and the type of clicking sound (with the tongue or with the hands) influences the learning of this technique, we divided the entire sample into four groups. Half of the participants produced the clicking sound with their tongue, the other half with their hands. Half of the participants performed the task in an anechoic chamber, the other half in a reverberant room. Subjects stood in front of five bars, each of a different size, and at five different distances from the subject. The dimension of the bars ensured a constant subtended angle for the five distances considered. The task was to identify the correct distance of the bar. We found that, even by the second session, the participants were able to judge the correct depth of the bar at a rate greater than chance. Improvements in both precision and accuracy were observed in all experimental sessions. More interestingly, we found significantly better performance in the reverberant room than in the anechoic chamber. The type of clicking did not modulate our results. This suggests that the echolocation technique can also be learned by sighted individuals and that room reverberation can influence this learning process. More generally, this study shows that total loss of sight is not a prerequisite for echolocation skills this suggests important potential implications on rehabilitation settings for persons with residual vision."

Since June 2014, an unexpected large dengue outbreak has attacked Guangzhou, China, resulting in more than 40,000 cases. Among the 1,942 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized dengue cases, 121 were diagnosed as severe dengue according to the 2009 WHO guideline, and 2 patients finally died. Laboratory diagnosis and virus isolation demonstrated that the majority (96%) cases were caused by dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1), and the others by serotype 2 (DENV-2). 14 DENV strains were isolated from the sera of acute-phase dengue patients during this outbreak, and the complete envelope (E) gene of 12 DENV-1 strains and two DENV-2 strains were determined using RT-PCR assay. Phylogenetic analysis based on the E gene revealed the DENV-1 strains isolated during the outbreak belonged to genotype I and V, respectively. These isolates formed three clades. DENV-2 isolates were assigned to the same clade belonging to genotype cosmopolitan. These strains isolated in 2014 were closely related to the isolates obtained from the same province, Guangdong, in 2013. No amino acid mutations known to increase virulence were identified throughout the E protein of isolates in 2014. These results indicate that dengue is turning into endemic in Guangdong, China, and extensive seroepidemiological investigation and mosquito control measures are critically needed in the future."

Applying two physics-derived techniques, the minimum spanning tree and the hierarchical tree, we analyzed the stock interdependence within the network of the China Securities Index (CSI) industry index basket. We observed that that obvious linkage effects existed among stock networks. CII and CCE, CAG and ITH as well as COU, CHA and REI were confirmed as the core nodes in the three different networks respectively. We also investigated the stability of linkage effects by estimating the mean correlations and mean distances, as well as the normalized tree length of these indices. In addition, using the GMM model approach, we found inter-node influence within the stock network had a pronounced effect on stock returns. Our results generally suggested that there appeared to be greater clustering effect among the indexes belonging to related industrial sectors than those of diverse sectors, and network comovement was significantly affected by impactive financial events in the reality. Besides, stocks that were more central within the network of stock market usually had higher returns for compensation because they endured greater exposure to correlation risk."
https://openalex.org/W2416708822,"Understanding how intra-specific differences in plant traits mediate vulnerability to herbivores of relevant habitat-forming plants is vital to attain a better knowledge on the drivers of the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Such studies, however, are rare in seagrass-mesograzer systems despite the increasingly recognized relevance of mesograzers as seagrass consumers. We investigated the role and potential trade-offs of multiple leaf traits in mediating the vulnerability of the seagrass Zostera noltei to different mesograzer species, the amphipod Gammarus insensibilis and the isopod Idotea chelipes. We worked with plants from two different meadows for which contrasting chemical and structural traits were expected based on previous information. We found that plants with high vulnerability to mesograzers (i.e. those preferred and subjected to higher rates of leaf area loss) had not only higher nitrogen content and lower C:N, fibre, and phenolics, but also tender and thinner leaves. No trade-offs between chemical and structural traits of the seagrass were detected, as they were positively correlated. When leaf physical structure was removed using agar-reconstituted food, amphipod preference towards high-susceptibility plants disappeared; thus indicating that structural rather than chemical traits mediated the feeding preference. Removal of plant structure reduced the size of isopod preference to less than half, indicating a stronger contribution of structural traits (> 50%) but combined with chemical/nutritional traits in mediating the preference. We then hypothesized that the high environmental nutrient levels recorded in the meadow exhibiting high susceptibility modulate the differences observed between meadows in seagrass traits. To test this hypothesis, we exposed low-vulnerability shoots to eutrophic nutrient levels in a 6-week enrichment experiment. Nutrient enrichment increased Z. noltei nitrogen content and lowered C:N, fibre, and phenolics, but had no effect on structural traits. Overall, our findings help to better understand the trait-mediated seagrass susceptibility to mesograzers and reinforce the increasingly recognized role of structural defences against herbivory."
https://openalex.org/W2415529945,"When people are asked to palpate a novel soft object to discern its physical properties such as texture, elasticity, and even non-homogeneity, they not only regulate probing behaviors, but also the co-contraction level of antagonistic muscles to control the mechanical impedance of fingers. It is suspected that such behavior tries to enhance haptic perception by regulating the function of mechanoreceptors at different depths of the fingertips and proprioceptive sensors such as tendon and spindle sensors located in muscles. In this paper, we designed and fabricated a novel two-degree of freedom variable stiffness indentation probe to investigate whether the regulation of internal stiffness, indentation, and probe sweeping velocity (PSV) variables affect the accuracy of the depth estimation of stiff inclusions in an artificial silicon phantom using information gain metrics. Our experimental results provide new insights into not only the biological phenomena of haptic perception but also new opportunities to design and control soft robotic probes."
https://openalex.org/W2418130505,"Background 
Early rehospitalization (<30 days) after discharge from kidney transplantation (KT) is associated with poor outcomes. We explored summary metrics of pre-transplant health status that may improve the identification of KT recipients at risk for early rehospitalization and mortality after transplant.


Materials and Methods 
We performed a retrospective cohort study of 8,870 adult (≥ 18 years) patients on hemodialysis who received KT between 2000 and 2010 at United States transplant centers. We linked Medicare data to United Network for Organ Sharing data and data from a national dialysis provider to examine pre-KT (1) Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, (2) physical function (PF) measured by the Short Form 36 Health Survey, and (3) the number of hospitalizations during the 12 months before KT as potential predictors of early rehospitalization after KT. We also explored whether these metrics are confounders of the known association between early rehospitalization and post-transplant mortality.


Results 
The median age was 52 years (interquartile range [IQR] 41, 60) and 63% were male. 29% were rehospitalized in 1 pre-KT hospitalizations (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.17–1.49) were more likely to be rehospitalized. All three health status metrics and early rehospitalization were independently associated with post-KT mortality in a multivariable Cox model (adjusted hazard ratio for rehospitalization: 1.41, 95% CI 1.28–1.56)


Conclusions 
Pre-transplant metrics of health status, measured by dialysis providers or administrative data, are independently associated with early rehospitalization and mortality risk after KT. Transplant providers may consider utilizing metrics of pre-KT global health status as early signals of vulnerability when transitioning care after KT."

While the demand for alternative treatments for kidney failure is acute, huge challenges remain to move these exciting but preliminary results toward clinical use. The successful generation of kidney-like structures from human pluripotent stem cells, although slower to come than other tissue types, brings the hope of new therapies. While the demand for alternative treatments for kidney failure is acute, huge challenges remain to move these exciting but preliminary results toward clinical use. Chronic kidney disease now affects 10%–15% of adults across the globe (Coresh et al., 2007Coresh J. Selvin E. Stevens L.A. Manzi J. Kusek J.W. Eggers P. Van Lente F. Levey A.S. JAMA. 2007; 298: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (3891) Google Scholar). While this apparent epidemic is being fueled by obesity and diabetes, the treatment options available for patients reaching end-stage renal disease have not changed in over half a century. End-stage renal disease patients are either provided renal replacement therapy (hemo- or peritoneal dialysis) or organ transplantation. With only one in four patients receiving an organ transplant, and high morbidity and mortality associated with dialysis, the development of new treatment options is critical. With the advent of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), the concept of regenerating a kidney became one possible therapeutic approach. However, kidney regeneration is a very challenging task, as this is an extremely complex organ. The kidney is comprised of more than 25 different cell types tasked with excretion, secretion, and fluid homeostasis. These allow the kidney to regulate blood pressure, blood volume, pH, red blood cell count, bone mineral metabolism, and toxin removal. The major task for the kidney, filtration of the blood to remove metabolites and nitrogenous wastes and reabsorb water, is carried out by the nephrons, each consisting of an unbranched epithelial tubule that is vascularized at one end (the glomerulus). An adult kidney can repair after injury, but rather than structural regeneration, this involves rapid epithelial turnover within the nephrons, either via proliferation of mature cells or the expansion of a residual tubular progenitor. No new nephron formation occurs in adults. Indeed, maladaptive repair responses are seen after chronic injury with this reduced epithelial repair, triggering tubulointerstitial fibrosis (Yang et al., 2011Yang L. Humphreys B.D. Bonventre J.V. Contrib. Nephrol. 2011; 174: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The lack of regenerative capacity after birth suggests that the kidney is an ideal organ to recreate using directed differentiation, albeit a challenging one. Progress toward this outcome has been slower than for some organ systems. Embryologically, the kidney is of mesodermal origin, arising from the intermediate mesoderm (Takasato and Little, 2015Takasato M. Little M.H. Development. 2015; 142: 1937-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). While the mesoderm-derived cardiomyocyte was a relatively early outcome of directed differentiation, to date efforts have more strongly focused on neural and endodermal tissues. However, studies into patterning of human PSCs to primitive streak and then definitive mesoderm, important for other mesodermal tissues including blood, have proven important for kidney as well. Careful lineage analysis in mouse suggests that the collecting ducts of the kidney arise from anterior intermediate mesoderm (IM), whereas the nephrons arise from the posterior IM (Taguchi et al., 2014Taguchi A. Kaku Y. Ohmori T. Sharmin S. Ogawa M. Sasaki H. Nishinakamura R. Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 53-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The origin of the vasculogenic endothelial progenitors and the surrounding stromal cells is less defined but is also likely to be IM, possibly from the posterior end. Importantly, cells present within these anterior and posterior regions are exposed to distinct spatiotemporal signals (Taguchi et al., 2014Taguchi A. Kaku Y. Ohmori T. Sharmin S. Ogawa M. Sasaki H. Nishinakamura R. Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 53-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, Takasato and Little, 2015Takasato M. Little M.H. Development. 2015; 142: 1937-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The ureteric bud (arises from anterior IM) is ultimately drawn toward the metanephric mesenchyme (arises from posterior IM) in response to glial-derived neurotrophic factor. Once these distinct populations meet, reciprocal inductive signals between these two populations drive continued organ growth throughout fetal development. Hence, the mesenchyme ensures sufficient collecting duct branching to drain all nephrons, and the ureteric bud ensures the formation of sufficient nephrons. Understanding the growth factors involved in these processes, as well as the gene expression signatures characteristic of all intermediate steps, has been critical for recreating these events in culture. While slower off the mark than other tissues, several groups have now applied stepwise protocols drawing on this understanding of embryogenesis to generate nephrons from human PSCs in vitro (Freedman et al., 2015Freedman B.S.

These studies all report evidence of critical intermediate mesodermal differentiation steps and draw on a similar set of growth factor signaling events to reach a kidney endpoint. A variety of culture formats and media have been used, yet they require the activation of a relatively small number of growth factor signaling pathways, with all protocols exploiting canonical WNT and FGF signaling. Indeed, the initial mesodermal patterning events all involve canonical Wnt signaling with or without addition of activin A and BMP4. With the exception of Freedman et al., 2015Freedman B.S. Brooks C.R. Lam A.Q. Fu H. Morizane R. Agrawal V. Saad A.F. Li M.K. Hughes M.R. Werff R.V. et al.Nat.

These studies also report the formation of spontaneously patterning and segmenting nephrons with proximal and distal tubular segments, as well as Bowman’s capsules, containing podocytes (Freedman et al., 2015Freedman B.S.

The identity of the specific kidney cell types within these cultures has relied upon our understanding of nephron patterning in mouse development, with clear evidence that the elongation, patterning, and differentiation of specific cell types known to exist in each nephron is occurring in the dish as has been described in development. More importantly, in a number of cases evidence supports a functional identity for component cell types within these differentiation cultures, including the demonstration of appropriate uptake of albumin and response to nephrotoxins by the proximal tubular segments (Freedman et al., 2015Freedman B.S. Brooks C.R. Lam A.Q. Fu H. Morizane R. Agrawal V. Saad A.F. Li M.K. Hughes M.R. Werff R.V. et al.Nat.

Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Little M.H. Nature. 2015; 526: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Transplantation of mouse induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived nephrons under the renal capsule showed evidence of glomerular vascularization resulting in the formation of a urinary filtrate (Sharmin et al., 2015Sharmin S. Taguchi A. Kaku Y. Yoshimura Y. Ohmori T. Sakuma T. Mukoyama M. Yamamoto T. Kurihara H. Nishinakamura R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2015; (Published online November 19, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.2015010096Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Finally, the generation of nephrons from CRISPR-edited human iPSCs containing mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 suggested evidence for disease-associated cyst formation (Freedman et al., 2015Freedman B.S. Brooks C.R. Lam A.Q. Fu H. Morizane R. Agrawal V. Saad A.F. Li M.K. Hughes M.R. Werff R.V. et al.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8715Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Taken together, this suggests that it is feasible to recreate a kidney nephron from PSCs and have these structures reach sufficient maturity for potential application in disease modeling and drug screening. Generating nephron-like structure from stem cells is a major advance. While these epithelial structures are key for blood filtration, reabsorption, and concentration of the urinary filtrate, in the kidney they are linked to a collecting duct network that is vascularized by blood vessels and present in a specific alignment within a surrounding interstitium. Recreation of a kidney will require all of these additional elements. Our own work (Takasato et al., 2015Takasato M. Er P.X. Chiu H.S. Maier B. Baillie G.J. Ferguson C. Parton R.G. Wolvetang E.J. Roost M.S. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Little M.H. Nature. 2015; 526: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) has shown that after aggregation of cell cultures into a 3D format, a complex organoid structure arises. Within these kidney organoids, there is evidence for the generation of not only nephrons but accompanying collecting ducts with these tubular elements present within an interstitium also containing vascular and perivascular cells (Takasato et al., 2015Takasato M. Er P.X. Chiu H.S. Maier B. Baillie G.J. Ferguson C. Parton R.G. Wolvetang E.J. Roost M.S. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Little M.H. Nature. 2015; 526: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). These kidney organoids, therefore, contain elements arising from along the length of the IM, comprising more than eight distinct cell types. Expression profiling of total kidney organoids in comparison to human fetal tissue confirmed their identity and showed that they are most similar to trimester one human kidney. While early evidence of vascularization of the glomeruli can be seen in these organoids, the nephrons are at a “capillary loop” stage requiring significant additional maturation. Further experiments are needed to determine whether kidney organoids derived using this approach are capable of drawing in a vasculature when transplanted under the kidney capsule of a recipient animal. The directed differentiation of human PSCs to kidney tissue is likely to facilitate the development of more accurate drug screening for nephrotoxicity as well as disease modeling for heritable forms of kidney disease. While such applications are exciting and promising, for those on the transplant list, the prospect of a bioengineered, tailor-matched replacement organ would be the more important outcome. Our own data showing the generation of kidney organoids were ambitiously described in the media as a “kidney in a dish” (Takasato et al., 2015Takasato M. Er P.X. Chiu H.S. Maier B. Baillie G.J. Ferguson C. Parton R.G. Wolvetang E.J. Roost M.S. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Little M.H. Nature. 2015; 526: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). While this and other recent reports are significant advances for stem cell biology, from here there is a very long way to go to creating a complete organ suitable for treatment. We will discuss here four major and very obvious challenges: scale, structure, function, and integration. A functional human kidney contains 200,000 to 2.5 million nephrons. This wide variation is determined prior to birth, and it is assumed that kidneys on the lower end of this broad spectrum continue to deliver normal renal function by having each nephron take more of the load. While we know that humans show significant variability in nephron number, and that effective glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduces with age and disease, a patient will not require dialysis to substitute renal function until his GFR drops to 10%–15% of normal. By comparison, human iPSC-derived kidney organoids of around 5–7 mm in diameter contain approximately 100 nephrons (Takasato et al., 2015Takasato M. Er P.X. Chiu H.S. Maier B. Baillie G.J. Ferguson C. Parton R.G. Wolvetang E.J. Roost M.S. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Little M.H. Nature. 2015; 526: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), falling well below that required to provide any meaningful glomerular filtration level (Figure 1). While many protocols for generating kidney cells pass through a nephron progenitor stage, this population does not appear to persist long term after nephron formation is induced. For this reason, it is not yet possible to continually increase the nephron number. In addition, none of the current culture protocols have been adapted for longer-term survival in culture. This would be critical for scaling up to the size of organ required. In addition, it is not yet clear how long such a culture could be maintained without providing circulation. As highlighted, the cellular complexity and functional diversity of the kidney provide a substantial barrier to regeneration. In addition, many physiological functions are achieved as a result of the actual architecture of the tissue. For example, the capacity for regulation of fluid balance relies upon a parallel alignment of the loops of Henle and a partitioning of tubular segments between a cortex and medulla. While recent studies have shown a capacity to generate segmenting nephrons, this formation of cortex and medulla with nephrons aligned with respect to each other is not evident. Similarly, the fetal organ is derived from an initial ureteric bud that dichotomously branches to form the collecting duct network through which the urinary filtrate can exit the organ (Takasato and Little, 2015Takasato M. Little M.H. Development. 2015; 142: 1937-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A regenerated organ must contain such a common exit path for urinary filtrate or risk the destruction of the nephrons as they fill with urine. Hence, the challenge of providing an exit path for the urine remains. Another obvious challenge is creating a blood supply. Recently reported kidney organoids contain vascular progenitors and collecting duct epithelium; however, the glomeruli are poorly vascularized and not attached to a circulatory system; hence, they will not generate urinary filtrate (Takasato et al., 2015Takasato M. Er P.X. Chiu H.S. Maier B. Baillie G.J. Ferguson C. Parton R.G. Wolvetang E.J. Roost M.S. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Little M.H. Nature. 2015; 526: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Human iPSC-derived nephrons can vascularize when transplanted under the renal capsule of a recipient animal (Sharmin et al., 2015Sharmin S. Taguchi A. Kaku Y. Yoshimura Y. Ohmori T. Sakuma T. Mukoyama M. Yamamoto T. Kurihara H. Nishinakamura R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2015; (Published online November 19, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.2015010096Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Similarly, iPSC-derived, nephron-forming mesenchyme has been co-cultured with HUVEC cells and mesenchymal stem cells to provide vasculature and interstitium, respectively. The resulting “organ buds” have also been shown to vascularize if transplanted retro-orbitally (Takebe et al., 2015Takebe T. Enomura M. Yoshizawa E. Kimura M. Koike H. Ueno Y. Matsuzaki T. Yamazaki T. Toyohara T. Osafune K. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2015; 16: 556-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To create a replacement organ, this challenge of tissue vascularization, and, indeed, connecting this to the recipient, must be addressed. In none of the directed differentiation protocols published to date is there comprehensive evidence of functional maturation. Based upon directed differentiation of PSCs to other tissue endpoints, reaching the level of functional maturation observed in an adult cell type has proven challenging. At best, the resulting tissues represent early embryonic structures. Hence, facilitating functional maturation is a major challenge. A baseline for any studies of kidney cell maturation will first require a thorough analysis of the cell types that can be identified in cultures of iPSC-derived kidney tissues. As most are likely to represent embryonic stages of differentiation, the optimal comparator would be human fetal tissue. However, expression profiling of individual human cell types during kidney development is not readily available. There is some analysis of maturation of proximal tubules in several studies. However, while proximal tubule cells derived from iPSCs have been shown to respond apparently appropriately to cisplatin (Freedman et al., 2015Freedman B.S. Brooks C.R. Lam A.Q. Fu H. Morizane R. Agrawal V. Saad A.F. Li M.K. Hughes M.R. Werff R.V. et al.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8715Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, Morizane et al., 2015Morizane R. Lam A.Q. Freedman B.S. Kishi S. Valerius M.T. Bonventre J.V. Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, Takasato et al., 2015Takasato M. Er P.X. Chiu H.S. Maier B. Baillie G.J. Ferguson C. Parton R.G. Wolvetang E.J. Roost M.S. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Little M.H. Nature. 2015; 526: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), different nephrotoxicants act on distinct basolateral or apical solute channels, many of which may not be expressed yet. It may be possible to isolate specific cell types and encourage further maturation in vitro. However, maturation may require onward differentiation in association with surrounding cell types or exposure to physiological conditions that do not exist or occur in isolated culture. Indeed, it is not clear if flow of urinary filtrate assists in proximal tubular maturation. If it does, this will require association of iPSC-derived nephrons with a vasculature. The issue of glomerular vascularization, which we discussed above, may also not occur without angiogenic ingrowth from a viable circulation. There is much work to do here. Given how enormous of a challenge it is to grow an entire organ, another approach is to generate specific kidney cell types from stem cells for delivery back into the existing kidney of the patient. This cellular therapy approach should, in theory, require fewer cells and potentially only critical cell types, such as podocytes or proximal tubular epithelium. It should also have fewer architectural challenges since the original organ provides the structure. Here, the hope would be to deliver functionally mature, or even kidney progenitor, cell types into a patient with successful integration of these cells improving organ function. As with most other organs, the major challenge is delivery. Injection into the parenchyma brings a risk of bleeding and no proof that the cells injected will insert into existing structures. No patient would receive such therapy without existing renal damage, much of which is accompanied by tubular damage, interstitial fibrosis, and inflammation. Such tissue damage would challenge integration of any introduced cell type. The evidence in mice for substantive integration of any cell type into the damaged kidney is weak, and there is little prospect of a clinical trial in humans prior to substantive functional decline. Another approach is the recellularization of a decellularized adult organ scaffold using human iPSC-derived kidney cells. Again, the complexity of the organ itself provides major challenges. This approach would exploit the intact basement membrane as an instructive environment for reintroduced cells. With this method, the only logical access point for nephron cell types is back up the collecting duct tree, which represents a very long and very thin access route, particularly for the podocytes of the glomeruli. However, some recent data suggest that sustained delivery of epithelial cells via the artery can deliver such cells back into tubular compartments (Caralt et al., 2015Caralt M. Uzarski J.S. Iacob S. Obergfell K.P. Berg N. Bijonowski B.M. Kiefer K.M. Ward H.H. Wandinger-Ness A. Miller W.M. et al.Am. J. Transplant. 2015; 15: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These advantages notwithstanding, there is a long way to go to recellularize an entire scaffold with sufficient cells, and the capacity for this scaffold to instruct cell fate still remains undetermined. This discussion has focused on the large gap between the generation of kidney cell types and the generation of a replacement kidney, but there are interim options, such as drug screening, disease modeling, and partial functional replacement, which are also useful to consider. Different cell types and structures provide various elements of renal function. Specific functions may be replicated by a subset of human PSC-derived kidney cells, analogous to how hemodialysis replaces the filtration and excretory role of the kidney without effective fluid reabsorption or other functions. For example, the provision of iPSC-derived cell types that produce erythropoietin may ameliorate the requirement for pharmacological provision of such compounds. Indeed, it may be possible to deliver other endocrine regulators in this way. The seeding of proximal tubular epithelium within extracorporeal devices may also supersede or improve dialysis. As intermediate products, these are likely to be more achievable but will also assist in the optimization of scale-up protocols for the generation of functional kidney cell types. Ultimately, from a clinical perspective, the target needs to be functional improvement over current dialytic approaches. With all these issues in mind, and with time, the challenge may become more realistic. M.H.L. is a National Health and Medical Research Council Senior Principal Research Fellow.

https://openalex.org/W2416906502,"Ex situ conservation in germplasm and living collections is a major focus of global plant conservation strategies. Prioritizing species for ex situ collection is a necessary component of this effort for which sound strategies are needed. Phylogenetic considerations can play an important role in prioritization. Collections that are more phylogenetically diverse are likely to encompass more ecological and trait variation, and thus provide stronger conservation insurance and richer resources for future restoration efforts. However, phylogenetic criteria need to be weighed against other, potentially competing objectives. We used ex situ collection and threat rank data for North American angiosperms to investigate gaps in ex situ coverage and phylogenetic diversity of collections and to develop a flexible framework for prioritizing species across multiple objectives. We found that ex situ coverage of 18,766 North American angiosperm taxa was low with respect to the most vulnerable taxa: just 43% of vulnerable to critically imperiled taxa were in ex situ collections, far short of a year-2020 goal of 75%. In addition, species held in ex situ collections were phylogenetically clustered (P < 0.001), i.e., collections comprised less phylogenetic diversity than would be expected had species been drawn at random. These patterns support incorporating phylogenetic considerations into ex situ prioritization in a manner balanced with other criteria, such as vulnerability. To meet this need, we present the 'PIECES' index (Phylogenetically Informed Ex situ Conservation of Endangered Species). PIECES integrates phylogenetic considerations into a flexible framework for prioritizing species across competing objectives using multi-criteria decision analysis. Applying PIECES to prioritizing ex situ conservation of North American angiosperms, we show strong return on investment across multiple objectives, some of which are negatively correlated with each other. A spreadsheet-based decision support tool for North American angiosperms is provided; this tool can be customized to align with different conservation objectives."

https://openalex.org/W2415583222,"In the present study, we used high-throughput sequencing, miRNA-seq, to discover and explore the expression profiles of known and novel miRNAs in TLR ligand-stimulated vis-à-vis non-stimulated (i.e. Control) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from blood of healthy Murrah buffaloes. Six small RNA (sRNA) libraries were multiplexed in Ion Torrent PI chip and sequenced on Ion Proton System. The reads obtained were aligned to the Bos taurus genome (UMD3.1 assembly), which is phylogenetically closest species to buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). A total of 160 bovine miRNAs were biocomputationally identified in buffalo PBMCs and 130 putatively novel miRNAs (not enlisted in the bovine mirBase) were identified. All of these 290 miRNAs identified across the six treatment and control samples represent the repertoire of novel miRNAs for the buffalo species. The expression profiles of these miRNAs across the samples have been represented by sample dendrogram and heatmap plots. The uniquely expressed miRNAs in each treatment and control groups were identified. A few miRNAs were expressed at very high levels while the majority of them were moderately expressed. The miRNAs bta-miR-103 and -191 were found to be highly abundant and expressed in all the samples. Other abundantly expressed miRNAs include bta-miR-19b, -29b, -15a, -19a, -30d, -30b-5p and members of let family (let 7a-5p, let 7g & let 7f) in LPS and CpG treated PBMCS and bta-miR-191, -103 & -19b in Poly I:C stimulated PBMCs. Only one novel miRNA (bta-miR-11039) out of 130 identified putatively novel miRNAs, was expressed in all the six samples and differentially expressed (>2- fold) miRNAs were identified. Six of the differentially expressed miRNAs across the groups (bta-miR-421, bta-let-7i, bta-miR-138, bta-miR-21-5p, bta-miR-222 and bta-miR-27b) were subsequently confirmed by TaqMan quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched for the roles in innate immunity and TLR signaling pathways. This maiden study on profiling and cataloguing of bubaline miRNAs expressed in TLR-ligand stimulated PBMCs will provide an important reference point for future studies on regulatory roles of miRNAs in immune system of buffaloes."
https://openalex.org/W2419551609,"In our attempt to comprehensively understand the nature of association of variants at 11q23.3 apolipoprotein gene cluster region, we genotyped a prioritized set of 96 informative SNPs using Fluidigm customized SNP genotyping platform in a sample of 508 coronary artery disease (CAD) cases and 516 controls. We found 12 SNPs as significantly associated with CAD at P <0.05, albeit only four (rs2849165, rs17440396, rs6589566 and rs633389) of these remained significant after Benjamin Hochberg correction. Of the four, while rs6589566 confers risk to CAD, the other three SNPs reduce risk for the disease. Interaction of variants that belong to regulatory genes BUD13 and ZPR1 with APOA5-APOA4 intergenic variants is also observed to significantly increase the risk towards CAD. Further, ROC analysis of the risk scores of the 12 significant SNPs suggests that our study has substantial power to confer these genetic variants as predictors of risk for CAD, as illustrated by AUC (0.763; 95% CI: 0.729-0.798, p = <0.0001). On the other hand, the protective SNPs of CAD are associated with elevated Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Total Cholesterol levels, hence with dyslipidemia, in our sample of controls, which may suggest distinct effects of the variants at 11q23.3 chromosomal region towards CAD and dyslipidemia. It may be necessary to replicate these findings in the independent and ethnically heterogeneous Indian samples in order to establish this as an Indian pattern. However, only functional analysis of the significant variants identified in our study can provide more precise understanding of the mechanisms involved in the contrasting nature of their effects in manifesting dyslipidemia and CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2280732323,"Arterial cerebral blood volume (aCBV) is associated with many physiologic and pathologic conditions. Recently, multiphase balanced steady state free precession (bSSFP) readout was introduced to measure labeled blood signals in the arterial compartment, based on the fact that signal difference between labeled and unlabeled blood decreases with the number of RF pulses that is affected by blood velocity. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of a new 2D inter-slice bSSFP-based arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique termed, alternate ascending/descending directional navigation (ALADDIN), to quantify aCBV using multiphase acquisition in six healthy subjects. A new kinetic model considering bSSFP RF perturbations was proposed to describe the multiphase data and thus to quantify aCBV. Since the inter-slice time delay (TD) and gap affected the distribution of labeled blood spins in the arterial and tissue compartments, we performed the experiments with two TDs (0 and 500 ms) and two gaps (300% and 450% of slice thickness) to evaluate their roles in quantifying aCBV. Comparison studies using our technique and an existing method termed arterial volume using arterial spin tagging (AVAST) were also separately performed in five subjects. At 300% gap or 500-ms TD, significant tissue perfusion signals were demonstrated, while tissue perfusion signals were minimized and arterial signals were maximized at 450% gap and 0-ms TD. ALADDIN has an advantage of visualizing bi-directional flow effects (ascending/descending) in a single experiment. Labeling efficiency (α) of inter-slice blood flow effects could be measured in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) (20.8±3.7%.) and was used for aCBV quantification. As a result of fitting to the proposed model, aCBV values in gray matter (1.4-2.3 mL/100 mL) were in good agreement with those from literature. Our technique showed high correlation with AVAST, especially when arterial signals were accentuated (i.e., when TD = 0 ms) (r = 0.53). The bi-directional perfusion imaging with multiphase ALADDIN approach can be an alternative to existing techniques for quantification of aCBV."
https://openalex.org/W2412119171,"Background Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected parasitic disease that is fatal if left untreated. VL is endemic in Morocco and other countries in North Africa were it mainly affects children from rural areas. In Morocco, the direct observation of Leishmania parasites in bone marrow aspirates and serological tests are used to diagnose VL. Glucantime is the first line of treatment. The objective of this study was to report the costs associated to standard clinical management of pediatric VL from the provider perspective in Morocco. As a secondary objective we described the current clinical practices and the epidemiological characteristics of pediatric VL patients. Methods From March to June 2014 we conducted a survey in eight hospitals treating pediatric VL patients in Morocco. A pro-forma was used to collect demographic, clinical and management data from medical records. We specifically collected data on VL diagnosis and treatment. We also estimated the days of hospitalization and the time to start VL treatment. Costs were estimated by multiplying the use of resources in terms of number of days in hospital, tests performed and drugs provided by the official prices. For patients receiving part of their treatment at Primary Health Centers (PHC) we estimated the cost of administering the Glucantime as outpatient. We calculated the median cost per VL patient. We also estimated the cost of managing a VL case when different treatment strategies were applied: inpatient and outpatient. Results We obtained data from 127 VL patients. The median total cost per pediatric VL case in Morocco is 520 US$. The cost in hospitals applying an outpatient strategy is significantly lower (307 US$) than hospitals keeping the patients for the whole treatment (636 US$). However the outpatient strategy is not yet recommended as VL treatment for children in the Moroccan guidelines. VL diagnosis and treatment regimens should be standardized following the current guidelines in Morocco."
https://openalex.org/W2418680385,"Background Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common disease causing visual impairment and blindness. Various gene variants are strongly associated with late stage AMD, but little is known about the genetics of early forms of the disease. This study evaluated associations of genetic factors and different AMD stages depending on unilateral and bilateral disease severity. Methods In this case-control study, participants were assigned to nine AMD severity stages based on the characteristics of each eye. 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped and attempted to correlate with AMD severity stages by uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses and trend analyses. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated. Results Of 3444 individuals 1673 were controls, 379 had early AMD, 333 had intermediate AMD and 989 showed late AMD stages. With increasing severity of disease and bilateralism more SNPs with significant associations were found. Odds ratios, especially for the main risk polymorphisms in ARMS2 (rs10490924) and CFH (rs1061170), gained with increasing disease severity and bilateralism (exemplarily: rs1061170: unilateral early AMD: OR = 1.18; bilateral early AMD: OR = 1.20; unilateral intermediate AMD: OR = 1.28; bilateral intermediate AMD: OR = 1.39, unilateral geographic atrophy (GA): OR = 1.50; bilateral GA: OR = 1.71). Trend analyses showed p<0.0001 for ARMS2 (rs10490924) and for CFH (rs1061170), respectively. AUC of risk models for various AMD severity stages was lowest for unilateral early AMD (AUC = 0.629) and showed higher values in more severely and bilaterally affected individuals being highest for late AMD with GA in one eye and neovascular AMD in the other eye (AUC = 0.957). Conclusion The association of known genetic risk factors with AMD became stronger with increasing disease severity, which also led to an increasing discriminative ability of AMD cases and controls. Genetic predisposition was also associated with the disease severity of the fellow-eye, highlighting the importance of both eyes in AMD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2413610227,"Interferon Regulatory Factor-8 (IRF-8) serves as a key factor in the hierarchical differentiation towards monocyte/dendritic cell lineages. While much insight has been accumulated into the mechanisms essential for its hematopoietic specific expression, the mode of restricting IRF-8 expression in non-hematopoietic cells is still unknown. Here we show that the repression of IRF-8 expression in restrictive cells is mediated by its 3rd intron. Removal of this intron alleviates the repression of Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) IRF-8 reporter gene in these cells. Fine deletion analysis points to conserved regions within this intron mediating its restricted expression. Further, the intron alone selectively initiates gene silencing only in expression-restrictive cells. Characterization of this intron’s properties points to its role as an initiator of sustainable gene silencing inducing chromatin condensation with suppressive histone modifications. This intronic element cannot silence episomal transgene expression underlining a strict chromatin-dependent silencing mechanism. We validated this chromatin-state specificity of IRF-8 intron upon in-vitro differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into cardiomyocytes. Taken together, the IRF-8 3rd intron is sufficient and necessary to initiate gene silencing in non-hematopoietic cells, highlighting its role as a nucleation core for repressed chromatin during differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2414826363,"Animals with socially monogamous mating systems are valuable for discovering proximate mechanisms of prosocial behavior and close social relationships. Especially powerful are comparisons between related species that differ in monogamous tendency. Birds are the most socially monogamous vertebrates. Thus far most research on mechanisms of pairing has used zebra finches, which do not have a relative with a different mating system, however. The goal of the experiments reported here was to develop a new comparative avian system by studying the pairing behavior of a reportedly strongly monogamous quail, the king quail (Coturnix chinensis), a species in the same clade as the less monogamous Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), the subject of much prior research. In Experiment 1 male-female pairs of king quail housed together were initially avoidant or aggressive but most rapidly progressed to allopreening and huddling. A separation-reunion paradigm reliably elicited both of these behaviors in males that had cohabited for one week. In Experiment 2 the allopreening and huddling behavior of males in cohabiting pairs was highly selective, and a majority of the males were aggressive toward a familiar female that was not the cohabitation partner. In Experiment 3 males were separated from their female cohabitation partners for 9-10 weeks and then given two-choice tests. All but one male spent more time near an unfamiliar female, which may have reflected aggression and shows recognition of and memory for the past pairing experience. Thus king quail show robust, selective and easy to measure pairing behavior that can be reliably elicited with simple separation-reunion testing procedures. Copulation is rarely seen during tests. The behavior of king quail is a striking contrast to that of Japanese quail, providing a new comparative system for discovering mechanisms of behavior related to close social relationships and monogamy."
https://openalex.org/W2415856281,"Conessine, a steroidal alkaloid isolated from Holarrhena floribunda, has anti-malarial activity and interacts with the histamine H3 receptor. However, the cellular effects of conessine are poorly understood. Accordingly, we evaluated the involvement of conessine in the regulation of autophagy. We searched natural compounds that modulate autophagy, and conessine was identified as an inhibitor of autophagic flux. Conessine treatment induced the formation of autophagosomes, and p62, an autophagic adapter, accumulated in the autophagosomes. Reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) result in muscle cell death by inducing excessive autophagic flux. Treatment with conessine inhibited H2O2-induced autophagic flux in C2C12 myoblast cells and also interfered with cell death. Our results indicate that conessine has the potential effect to inhibit muscle cell death by interfering with autophagic flux."
https://openalex.org/W2409646858,"For considering vaccine-prevention of pneumococcal acute otitis media (PncAOM), relationships between pneumococcal carriage, respiratory infection and PncAOM need to be understood. We analyzed nasopharyngeal samples collected from 329 unvaccinated Finnish children aged 2–24 months at scheduled visits and at visits during respiratory infection in 1994–97. We assessed temporal associations of respiratory infection with pneumococcal acquisition and whether PncAOM hazard depends on the relative timing of acquisition and the infection onset. The data comprised 607 person-years of risk-time for acquisition, 245 person-months of concurrent respiratory infection and carriage, and 119 episodes of PncAOM. The acquisition hazard was 3-fold in the month preceding respiratory sickness (hazard ratio, HR 3.5, 90% credible interval CI 2.9, 4.1) as compared to acquisition in healthy children. Moreover, the PncAOM hazard was markedly higher (HR 3.7, 90% CI 2.4, 5.3) during the first month of carriage acquired around the acute phase of respiratory infection (between 1 month before and 1 week after the sickness onset), as compared to carriage acquired later during sickness. The high proportion (76%) of PncAOM events occurring within 1 month of acquisition was due to frequent acquisition being associated with respiratory infection as well as the susceptibility of such acquisition to cause otitis media."
https://openalex.org/W2471378071,"In the present study, the combination of the micronucleus test with analysis of the activity of the rRNA genes in mutagen-treated Hordeum vulgare (barley) by maleic hydrazide (MH) cells was performed. Simultaneously fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with 25S rDNA as probes and an analysis of the transcriptional activity of 35S rRNA genes with silver staining were performed. The results showed that transcriptional activity is always maintained in the micronuclei although they are eliminated during the next cell cycle. The analysis of the transcriptional activity was extended to barley nuclei. MH influenced the fusion of the nucleoli in barley nuclei. The silver staining enabled detection of the nuclear bodies which arose after MH treatment. The results confirmed the usefulness of cytogenetic techniques in the characterization of micronuclei. Similar analyses can be now extended to other abiotic stresses to study the response of plant cells to the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2419219587,"The Hokkaido salamander (Hynobius retardatus) is endemic to Hokkaido Island, Japan, and shows intriguing flexible phenotypic plasticity and regional morphological diversity. However, to date, allozymes and partial mitochondria DNA sequences have provided only an outline of its demographic histories and the pattern of its genetic diversification. To understand the finer details of the population structure of this species and its evolution since speciation, we genotyped five regional populations by using 12 recently developed microsatellite polymorphic markers. We found a clear population structure with low gene flow among the five populations, but a close genetic relationship between the Teshio and Kitami populations. Our demographic analysis suggested that Teshio and Erimo had the largest effective population sizes among the five populations. These findings regarding the population structure and demography of H. retardatus improve our understanding of the faunal phylogeography on Hokkaido Island and also provide fundamental genetic information that will be useful for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2410829975,"Genetic causes of male infertility are hypothesized to involve multiple types of mutations, from single gene defects to complex chromosome rearrangements. Recently, several recurrent X-chromosome microdeletions (located in subtelomeric region of the long arm) were reported to be associated with male infertility in Spanish and Italian males. The aim of our study was to test their prevalence and infertility association in population of men from the Czech Republic.107 males with pathological sperm evaluation resulting in nonobstructive infertility were compared to 131 males with normal fecundity. X-chromosome microdeletions were assessed by +/- PCR with three primer pairs for each region Xcnv64 (Xq27.3), Xcnv67 (Xq28) and Xcnv69 (Xq28). The latter microdeletion was further characterized by amplification across the deleted region, dividing the deletion into three types; A, B and C.We detected presence of isolated Xcnv64 deletion in 3 patients and 14 controls, and Xcnv69 in 3 patients and 6 controls (1 and 1 patient vs.4 and 1 control for types A and B respectively). There was one control with combined Xcnv64 and Xcnv69 type B deletions, and one patient with combination of Xcnv64 and Xcnv69 type C deletions. The frequency of the deletions was thus not higher in patient compared to control group, Xcnv64 was marginally associated with controls (adjusted Fisher´s exact test P = 0.043), Xcnv69 was not associated (P = 0.452). We excluded presence of more extensive rearrangements in two subjects with combined Xcnv64 and Xcnv69 deletions. There was no Xcnv67 deletion in our cohort.In conclusion, the two previously reported X-linked microdeletions (Xcnv64 and Xcnv69) do not seem to confer a significant risk to impaired spermatogenesis in the Czech population. The potential clinical role of the previously reported patient-specific Xcnv67 remains to be determined in a larger study population."
