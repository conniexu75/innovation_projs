This establishes a strong relationship between resting-state functional connectivity and task-evoked functional connectivity—areas of neuroscientific inquiry typically considered separately. Recent advances in human neuroimaging have led to numerous studies characterizing interregional temporal relationships during task and resting states (Fox and Greicius, 2010Fox M.D. Greicius M. Clinical applications of resting state functional connectivity.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, Friston, 2011Friston K.J. Functional and effective connectivity: a review.Brain Connect. 2011; 1: 13-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). Initial functional connectivity (FC) studies focused on FC during task states (Friston, 1994Friston K.J. Functional and effective connectivity in neuroimaging: a synthesis.Hum. Brain Mapp. 1994; 2: 56-78Crossref Scopus (1739) Google Scholar), yet FC during the resting state has come to dominate the field (Biswal et al., 2010Biswal B.B. Mennes M. Zuo X.-N. Gohel S. Kelly C. Smith S.M. Beckmann C.F. Adelstein J.S. Buckner R.L. Colcombe S. et al.Toward discovery science of human brain function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). There are many reasons for this shift in focus, although perhaps the most influential is the notion that resting-state FC may characterize an “intrinsic” functional network architecture that is present across many (or all) brain states (Fox and Raichle, 2007Fox M.D. Raichle M.E. Spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging.Nat. Rev.

Raichle M.E. Intrinsic functional architecture in the anaesthetized monkey brain.Nature. 2007; 447: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar), much like structural connectivity. If true, this would greatly simplify the study of functional brain organization—from needing to consider a virtually infinite variety of task states to considering a state space strongly constrained by a single (or few) network architecture(s). Thus, determining the universality of the resting-state network architecture is an important step toward understanding the brain’s functional organization. Most comparisons between task and rest FC have observed high correspondence (Fair et al., 2007Fair D.A. Schlaggar B.L. Cohen A.L. Miezin F.M. Dosenbach N.U. Wenger K.K. Fox M.D. Snyder A.Z.

USA. 2003; 100: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar), but these comparisons have been limited to small sets of task states and connections. More recent comparisons between task and rest FC have emphasized differences in FC patterns, also during a small number of task states (Buckner et al., 2013Buckner R.L. Krienen F.M. Yeo B.T.T.

The extrinsic and intrinsic functional architectures of the human brain are not equivalent.Cereb. Cortex. 2013; 23: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thus, some studies advocate a more universal architecture, while others advocate differential task and resting architectures. We sought to test for universality of the resting-state network architecture in a more comprehensive manner by using large-scale graphs built from FC among hundreds of brain regions encompassing every major brain system (Power et al., 2011Power J.D. Cohen A.L. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Barnes K.A. Church J.A. Vogel A.C. Laumann T.O. Miezin F.M. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E. Functional network organization of the human brain.Neuron. 2011; 72: 665-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2508) Google Scholar) across dozens of task states (Barch et al., 2013Barch D.M. Burgess G.C. Harms M.P. Petersen S.E. Schlaggar B.L. Corbetta M. Glasser M.F. Curtiss S. Dixit S.

Bagic A. Kass R. Schneider W. Prefrontal dynamics underlying rapid instructed task learning reverse with practice.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 14245-14254Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and rest. We hypothesized that resting-state FC would reveal an intrinsic network architecture that would also be present across a wide variety of task states. We also hypothesized that some task-evoked FC changes from this intrinsic architecture would be evident (“evoked” network architectures) but that these evoked changes would tend to be small and be restricted to a relatively small number of connections for any given task. This would suggest that the intrinsic network architecture represents a standard state of brain organization that is modified as necessary to implement task demands. Generally, this would help bridge resting-state FC and task FC findings in the literature, facilitating a more comprehensive account of human brain organization. It may be that evoked FC changes occur in the presence of an intrinsic functional network architecture that extends across many or all brain states (e.g., rest and tasks). To address this question, we used fMRI to measure temporal relationships between hundreds of brain regions across dozens of task states and rest in single subjects. Two data sets were used. The first data set involved the permuted rule operations cognitive paradigm (Cole et al., 2010Cole M.W. Bagic A. Kass R. Schneider W. Prefrontal dynamics underlying rapid instructed task learning reverse with practice.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 14245-14254Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that contained 12 rules that were permuted into 64 distinct task states in short task blocks (Figure 1A). Tasks were defined as distinct cognitive processes, such that the same stimuli could be presented across each of the 64 tasks, but distinct cognitive processes would be necessary to respond correctly to each one. Importantly, this paradigm isolated cognitive task set differences by minimizing perceptual changes across tasks (e.g., changes in visual field, sensory modality). To extend and test the robustness of findings from the 64-task data set, we also conducted analyses with a Human Connectome Project data set (118 subjects) that included rest and a set of seven tasks (Figure 1B) (Barch et al., 2013Barch D.M. Burgess G.C. Harms M.P. Petersen S.E. Schlaggar B.L. Corbetta M. Glasser M.F. Curtiss S. Dixit S. Feldt C. et al.WU-Minn HCP ConsortiumFunction in the human connectome: task-fMRI and individual differences in behavior.Neuroimage. 2013; 80: 169-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The seven tasks were highly distinct from one another, although they also differed in basic perceptual aspects (e.g., changes in visual field, sensory modality), which could be a larger driver of FC differences than cognitive task set differences. FC was estimated as temporal correlations (Zalesky et al., 2012Zalesky A. Fornito A. Bullmore E. On the use of correlation as a measure of network connectivity.Neuroimage. 2012; 60: 2096-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) among a set of 264 putative functional regions throughout the brain (defined independently to reduce potential statistical biases) (Power et al., 2011Power J.D. Cohen A.L. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Barnes K.A. Church J.A. Vogel A.C. Laumann T.O. Miezin F.M. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E. Functional network organization of the human brain.Neuron. 2011; 72: 665-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2508) Google Scholar). These correlations were estimated for task FC after regressing out (across-trial mean) task-evoked activations and removing the short rest periods between task blocks from each region’s time series. In addition to testing for the existence of an intrinsic network architecture—an architecture common across rest and multiple task states—we sought to identify interregional connections unique to each task state, together comprising a set of evoked network architectures. To estimate both intrinsic and evoked architectures simultaneously, we used a tool (multislice community detection) developed to extract clusters and cluster changes in multinetwork systems (Mucha et al., 2010Mucha P.J. Richardson T. Macon K. Porter M.A. Onnela J.P. Community structure in time-dependent, multiscale, and multiplex networks.Science. 2010; 328: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar) and recently applied to neuroimaging data sets (Bassett et al., 2011Bassett D.S. Wymbs N.F. Porter M.A. Mucha P.J. Carlson J.M. Grafton S.T. Dynamic reconfiguration of human brain networks during learning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 7641-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). Unlike other clustering algorithms, this algorithm enabled us to identify network communities (putative functional modules) in brain networks both within and across task states. Using this approach, we identified network communities elicited differentially across tasks (using a low intertask coupling parameter), and we also identified consensus communities present across tasks (using a high intertask coupling parameter). The assignment of brain regions to communities is referred to as a “partition.” The coupling parameter determines the extent to which identified partitions are constrained by multiple task states. We were most interested in low coupling parameters, in which all task states are considered separately, and also especially interested in high coupling parameters (identified by the production of a partition stable across additional increases in the coupling parameter), in which all task states are considered together. To examine the relationship between these community partitions and a previously defined resting-state FC community partition (Power et al., 2011Power J.D. Cohen A.L. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Barnes K.A. Church J.A. Vogel A.C. Laumann T.O. Miezin F.M. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E. Functional network organization of the human brain.Neuron. 2011; 72: 665-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2508) Google Scholar) (Figure 2B), we calculated the partition similarity using the Z score of the Rand coefficient (Traud et al., 2011Traud A.L. Kelsic E.D. Mucha P.J. Porter M.A. Comparing community structure to characteristics in online collegiate social networks.SIAM Rev. 2011; 53: 526-543Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that there would be significant differences among the task partitions at low coupling parameters but that they would converge on a consensus partition similar to the resting-state FC community partition at high coupling parameters. Note that the multislice community detection approach forces a single consensus partition at high coupling parameters, but this approach does not require that the consensus partition look like any other particular partition (e.g., a resting-state FC partition). Furthermore, this approach does not require that partitions differentiate from any particular other partition at low coupling parameters. When the coupling parameter was low, allowing greater independence of communities across tasks, significant differences were found in community structure across tasks (Figure 2C). This was found using an ANOVA on partition similarities with a coupling parameter of 0 (see Experimental Procedures for details): F(63,13) = 21, p < 0.00001. This indicates that the brain’s functional network architecture can differ between task states, as implied by previous task FC studies (Bassett et al., 2011Bassett D.S. Wymbs N.F. Porter M.A. Mucha P.J. Carlson J.M. Grafton S.T. Dynamic reconfiguration of human brain networks during learning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 7641-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, Friston, 2011Friston K.J.

Sci. 2013; 17: 493-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). When coupling parameters were higher, encouraging the algorithm to find common structure across tasks, a single architecture emerged with high similarity to the resting-state network architecture: Z = 24, p < 0.00001. Similar results were obtained in the seven-task data set (Figure 2D). Note that across all tasks, and even with low coupling parameters and thus more variable partitioning (Figure 2C, left), the similarity of task partitioning to resting-state partitioning was high (task with lowest similarity: Z = 7, p < 0.00001). This indicates that the network architecture present across many task states is also present during rest, signifying the general relevance of resting-state FC to task states. We used the multislice community approach because of its ability to simultaneously characterize network dynamics in terms of interstate differentiation (at low coupling parameters) and interstate similarity (at high coupling parameters). We next used a simpler approach to better characterize the intrinsic network architecture observed at high coupling parameters. This approach involved building FC matrices of pairwise functional connections separately for multitask and resting-state FC. We equated these two forms of FC for comparison by calculating multitask FC as similarly as possible to how resting-state FC was calculated. Specifically, multitask functional connections were calculated as correlations across the concatenated time series of all 64 tasks (excluding rest periods). We thus define the multitask matrix as the network organization observed across many task states, estimated from 58 min of task fMRI per subject (Figure 3A, left). As a comparison, we define a resting-state matrix using resting-state FC, estimated from 10 min of rest fMRI per subject (Figure 3A, right). We found that the across-subject mean resting-state FC and multitask FC matrices were highly similar (r = 0.90, p < 0.00001), supporting the existence of intrinsic FC common across rest and a variety of task states. This result was replicated in the seven-task data set (Figure 4): r = 0.90, p < 0.00001. Note that the seven-task data set estimates were based on 40 min of task fMRI data and 56 min of rest fMRI data per subject. Together, these results suggest that a highly similar underlying network architecture is present across rest and task. We hypothesized that the equivalence of multitask FC and resting-state FC was due to resting-state FC reflecting the most frequent (modal) state of a given connection, suggesting each FC value has a “standard” value that tends to remain unchanged across task states and rest. We calculated a multitask modal FC matrix by calculating the mode across all 64 tasks for each connection (Figure 5). Consistent with our hypothesis, the multitask modal FC matrix was highly correlated with the multitask matrix (64-task data set, r = 0.92; seven-task data set, r = 0.97). We more directly tested this possibility by comparing the multitask modal FC matrix with the resting-state FC matrix. Though the correlation was lower than with the original multitask matrix it was still highly significant (64-task data set: r = 0.83, p < 0.00001; seven-task data set, r = 0.88, p < 0.00001), suggesting intrinsic FC reflects the most frequent state of a given connection. Intuitively, this can be visualized as an approximately Gaussian distribution for each connection across brain states, with a prominent peak reflecting the modal value and suggesting a tendency for the connection’s strength to remain stable across states. We next sought to better characterize the intrinsic network architecture by identifying the network communities present in the resting-state and multitask FC matrices and comparing these partitions to a previously identified resting-state community partition (Figure 2B). A standard algorithm (Blondel et al., 2008Blondel V.D. Guillaume J.-L. Lambiotte R. Fast unfolding of communities in large networks.J. Stat. Mech. 2008; 2008: P10008Crossref Scopus (11168) Google Scholar) was used to identify communities—groups of regions with stronger within-group FC than expected in a nonparametric null model (see Experimental Procedures for details). We observed similar network partitions for resting-state FC and multitask FC (Figure 3B): Z = 128, p < 0.00001. Furthermore, the resting-state FC (Z = 94, p < 0.00001) and multitask FC (Z = 79, p < 0.00001) partitions were also similar to the partition identified by Power et al., 2011Power J.D. Cohen A.L. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Barnes K.A. Church J.A. Vogel A.C. Laumann T.O. Miezin F.M. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E. Functional network organization of the human brain.Neuron. 2011; 72: 665-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2508) Google Scholar using independent resting-state data and a distinct community detection approach (Figure 2B). Note that the few observable differences between the partitions in Figure 3B were not stable (i.e., they shifted depending on the exact partitioning parameters chosen) and likely reflect noise in the data given the small number of subjects included in this analysis. These results support the conclusion that there is an intrinsic FC architecture that is present across rest and a variety of tasks and that this network architecture is largely consistent with known functional systems such as visual, default, and fronto-parietal systems. The results thus far suggest the existence of both intrinsic and evoked network architectures and that the intrinsic network architecture reflects a standard value for each functional connection across task states. This implies that the intrinsic network architecture continues to shape the brain’s overall functional network structure during tasks but that task-specific FC changes are also present. We next assessed the degree to which intrinsic FC and evoked FC contribute to each task’s functional network structure (i.e., each task’s FC matrix). As before, we primarily utilized FC matrix comparisons. We illustrate these FC matrix comparisons using the seven-task data set (Figure 6), given the better single-task FC estimates due to substantially larger amount of data per task (several minutes each) relative to the 64-task data set (approximately 22 s each). We continue to focus on the seven-task data set whenever single-task FC estimates are involved. We assessed the relative contribution of intrinsic FC and evoked FC to each task FC matrix by calculating the correlation between the intrinsic FC matrices and each task individually (Figure 6 and Figure S1A available online). As before, we compared whole-brain FC matrices using Pearson correlations, but we now square the resulting r values to facilitate inferences regarding percent variance explained. We found that the resting-state FC matrix was highly correlated with each individual task on average (mean squared Pearson correlation coefficient [r2] = 0.38, t(63) = 153, p < 0.00001), as was the multitask FC matrix (mean r2 = 0.46, t(63) = 166, p < 0.00001). Moreover, we observed that the multitask FC matrix accounted for more of the intertask variance than did the resting-state FC matrix (Student’s t test on the Pearson correlation coefficients [r] between the reference matrix and the individual task matrices: t(63) = 55, p < 0.00001). Note that for these comparisons the multitask FC matrix was estimated from 63 tasks: the to-be-compared task was removed from the multitask estimates to remove circularity. We explore the implications of greater similarity of individual tasks to multitask than rest FC further below. We next asked whether similar results could be obtained from the seven-task data set. Despite large differences between the data sets, our findings in the 64-task data set were also observed in the seven-task data set. Specifically, the resting-state FC matrix was highly correlated with each individual task on average (mean r2 = 0.70, t(6) = 26, p < 0.00001), as was the multitask FC matrix (mean r2 = 0.81, t(6) = 17, p < 0.00001). Moreover, we observed that the multitask FC matrix accounted for more of the intertask variance than did the resting-state FC matrix (Student’s t test on the Pearson correlation coefficients between the reference matrix and the individual task matrices: t(6) = 4, p = 0.006). Note that the differences in effect sizes between the data sets was due to differences in the amount of data per task (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), corroborating our decision to focus primarily on the seven-task data set for analyses involving individual task FC estimates. To further confirm the existence of an intrinsic network architecture across diverse brain states, we used a complementary data-driven approach: principal component analysis on all seven of the task FC matrices. We identified a single principal component that accounted for approximately 85% of the variance in intertask network architecture (Figure 7A). Consistent with our prior analyses, this component looked very similar to the resting-state FC matrix (r = 0.90) (Figure 7B). Furthermore, the weighting of every task on this first component was positive, signifying that the component was present across all tasks. Finally, we assessed the contribution of resting-state FC to this component relative to task FC. We performed a second principal component analysis on eight FC matrices: the seven task FC matrices and one resting-state FC matrix. We again identified a component that accounted for approximately 85% of the variance in interstate network architecture. We controlled for the amount of data by ensuring that the resting-state FC matrix was estimated using the same number of time points as one of the task FC matrices (the “emotional” task). We observed that the first principal component in this larger decomposition was most highly weighted to the resting-state FC matrix, with a weight of 0.42 (next highest, 0.41; average weight of the seven tasks, 0.34) (Figure 7C). These results complement our prior analyses by again demonstrating the existence of an intrinsic functional network architecture across task states and by suggesting that this architecture is similar to all task-specific FC network architectures as well as the resting-state FC network architecture. We next used a distinct approach to better determine the amount of FC modification relative to rest for each of the seven tasks. Rather than using matrix correlations, we tested each connection independently using t tests (p < 0.05, false discovery rate corrected for multiple comparisons). We then calculated the percentage of connections significantly changed from rest (Figure 8A), indicating that 38.98% of connections were altered on average (minimum, 33.92%; maximum, 48.37%). This is consistent with the result obtained using matrix correlations reported above, despite reporting in terms of the number of estimated changes rather than variance explained. Together these results suggest most functional connections are not changed significantly from the resting-state network architecture during a given task state. Further confirming the generally small amount of change from rest, the average absolute value FC change from rest across all tasks and connections was 0.04 (0.07 among significantly changed connections). We next explored the properties of the relatively few (but likely functionally important) task-evoked FC changes from rest. We began by plotting each functional connection’s change from rest versus its connection strength at rest (Figure 8B). A negative relationship was apparent, indicating that connections with higher resting-state FC tend to decrease during tasks, while connections with lower resting-state FC tend to increase during tasks. This was the case for all seven tasks (r values of −0.24, −0.66, −0.48, −0.53, −0.61, −0.38, and −0.58; all p < 0.00001). We next plotted the significant changes from rest for each task, separately for increases and decreases (Figure 8C). This revealed a complex pattern, with many connections being changed across all or most tasks. Notably, there was a strong tendency for within-community connections to decrease (percent of significant within-community FC changes that were decreases, 79%), while there was a small tendency toward between-community connections increasing (percent of significant between-community FC changes that were increases, 51%). This is consistent with the observed negative correlations between task-evoked FC changes and resting-state FC, given that the communities were defined based on strong resting-state FC. Note that even though strong positive connections tended to decrease, they almost always stayed strongly positive during tasks (Figure 6). We next summarized consistent across-task FC changes from rest by subtracting the multitask FC matrix by the resting-state FC matrix (Figure 8D). The similarity between this FC matrix and consistent FC changes across tasks in Figure 8C suggests that the above-mentioned results demonstrating greater individual-task FC similarity to multitask than rest FC (Figures 6 and S1) was due to consistent task FC changes from rest. We also ran this analysis with the 64-task data set (Figure 8E), revealing a relatively similar result (r = 0.31, p < 0.00001) despite major differences between data sets. Within-community connections for both the seven-task (mean within-community change, −0.04) and the 64-task (mean within-community change, −0.02) tended to decrease for multitask FC relative to resting-state FC. The present findings reframe resting-state FC and task FC in terms of intrinsic versus evoked network architectures. This framework may facilitate an integrated understanding across the subfields of neuroscience that currently focus separately on either resting-s"
https://openalex.org/W1973720948,"Tuberculosis remains second only to HIV/AIDS as the leading cause of mortality worldwide due to a single infectious agent. Despite chemotherapy, the global tuberculosis epidemic has intensified because of HIV co-infection, the lack of an effective vaccine and the emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Alternative host-directed strategies could be exploited to improve treatment efficacy and outcome, contain drug-resistant strains and reduce disease severity and mortality. The innate inflammatory response elicited by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) represents a logical host target. Here we demonstrate that interleukin-1 (IL-1) confers host resistance through the induction of eicosanoids that limit excessive type I interferon (IFN) production and foster bacterial containment. We further show that, in infected mice and patients, reduced IL-1 responses and/or excessive type I IFN induction are linked to an eicosanoid imbalance associated with disease exacerbation. Host-directed immunotherapy with clinically approved drugs that augment prostaglandin E2 levels in these settings prevented acute mortality of Mtb-infected mice. Thus, IL-1 and type I IFNs represent two major counter-regulatory classes of inflammatory cytokines that control the outcome of Mtb infection and are functionally linked via eicosanoids. Our findings establish proof of concept for host-directed treatment strategies that manipulate the host eicosanoid network and represent feasible alternatives to conventional chemotherapy."

Optogenetically silencing DG or CA3 cells that were recruited during encoding of a fear-inducing context prevented expression of the corresponding memory. Mice with reduced neurogenesis displayed less contextual memory and less reactivation in CA3 but, surprisingly, normal reactivation in the DG. These studies suggest that distinct memory traces are located in the DG and in CA3 but that the strength of the memory is related to reactivation in CA3. The hippocampal circuit is essential for episodic and contextual memory formation, storage, and retrieval. Many models have stressed the importance of the hippocampus (HPC) subregions in distinguishing similar patterns (pattern separation) and in completing partial patterns (pattern completion) (Bakker et al., 2008Bakker A.

Rolls E.T. Computational constraints suggest the need for two distinct input systems to the hippocampal CA3 network.Hippocampus. 1992; 2: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the dentate gyrus (DG) disambiguates similar inputs coming from the entorhinal cortex via sparse, strong mossy fiber projections from the granule cells to CA3. In contrast, CA3 pyramidal cells have been proposed to be involved in pattern completion because of their abundant recurrent collaterals (Treves and Rolls, 1992Treves A. Rolls E.T. Computational constraints suggest the need for two distinct input systems to the hippocampal CA3 network.Hippocampus. 1992; 2: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Within the DG and CA3, immediate early genes (IEGs) are typically expressed in a sparse pattern (Guzowski et al., 1999Guzowski J.F. McNaughton B.L. Barnes C.A. Worley P.F. Environment-specific expression of the immediate-early gene Arc in hippocampal neuronal ensembles.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). One particular IEG, Arc/Arg3.1, has been widely implicated in synaptic plasticity and HPC-dependent memory (Link et al., 1995Link W. Konietzko U. Kauselmann G. Krug M. Schwanke B. Frey U. Kuhl D.

In this study, we utilized the IEG Arc in order to understand how a memory trace is formed and retrieved in the HPC under a number of conditions. We designed the ArcCreERT2 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice to test this hypothesis not just on a short timescale (Lyford et al., 1995Lyford G.L. Yamagata K. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Sanders L.K. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F.

Perkins B.L. Matsuo N. Mayford M. Localization of a stable neural correlate of associative memory.Science. 2007; 317: 1230-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) but also on a long timescale (indefinitely). This system allows for the comparison of cells activated during the encoding of a memory versus cells activated during the expression of that memory. Our hypothesis was that the cells reactivated during expression of a memory are a component of the memory trace. In order to directly test this hypothesis, we optogenetically inactivated DG and CA3 cells that were recruited during contextual fear conditioning (CFC) and show that this manipulation inhibited expression of the corresponding memory. In addition, we find that mice with reduced adult hippocampal neurogenesis display less contextual memory and less reactivation in CA3 but, surprisingly, normal reactivation in the DG. Together, these results suggest that levels of reactivation in CA3 are related to the strength of the memory and that young adult-born granule cells in the DG contribute to the formation of the memory trace in CA3. For generation of transgenic animals, ArcCreERT2 BAC DNA was linearlized by PI-SceI enzyme digestion (New England Biolabs) and injected into fertilized eggs from CBA/C57Bl/6J mice. Two founders (one female [F line] and one male [M line]) resulted from this injection, and both lines have been maintained. Mice derived from the M line are described within this text. ArcCreERT2 mice were initially bred with the R26R-STOP-floxed-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) line to allow for a direct comparison between the permanently labeled EYFP+ cells that are activated during encoding and the recently activated Arc+ cells following memory expression (Figure 1). Ninety-nine percent of cells immunoreactive for Arc expressed nuclear Cre-recombinase following administration of tamoxifen (TAM) and CFC (Figure S1 available online), indicating high fidelity between the expression of endogenous Arc protein and the CreERT2 transgene. In order to minimize any nonspecific EYFP label, we performed a number of manipulations to control the stimuli before and after the TAM injection (Figure 2). In the protocol that resulted in the lowest background of EYFP label, mice were dark housed the night before and then for 3 days following the TAM injection (Figure 2A). These results are consistent with previous studies showing that after a single intraperitoneal injection of TAM, there is a significant nuclear accumulation of CreER within 24 hr and that this nuclear signal disappears by 48 hr, indicating that TAM is no longer active 48 hr postinjection. In these experiments, the appearance of the reporter is detected at approximately 12 hr after the injection and these cells continue to accumulate for about 36 hr (Hayashi and McMahon, 2002Hayashi S. McMahon A.P. Efficient recombination in diverse tissues by a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre: a tool for temporally regulated gene activation/inactivation in the mouse.Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). To examine whether the EYFP label is a reliable marker of a CFC experience, we assessed reactivation in the HPC of ArcCreERT2 mice that were exposed to context A with and without a foot shock and then were re-exposed 5 days later to context A (Figure S2). As expected, mice administered CFC exhibited markedly higher levels of freezing than did mice exposed to the context without foot shock (Figure 2B). CFC resulted in an increase in the number of EYFP+ cells in the DG (2.5-fold; p < 0.03) and in CA3 (6.6 fold; p = 0.05) when compared to context presentation alone (Figures 2C, 2E, 2G, 2I, and S2). These data indicate that the majority of EYFP+ cells are specific for the CFC experience. First, we determined how context specificity affects hippocampal memory traces. Mice were administered CFC in context A and then exposed to context A or a novel context B 5 days later to determine whether reactivation is associated with CFC memory (Figure 3A). In these conditions, ArcCreERT2 mice froze significantly more in context A than in B (Figure 3B) (F(1,17) = 22.4398, p < 0.001). In the DG, the number of EYFP+ (Figure 3C) and Arc+ cells (Figure 3D) did not differ between groups. However, the percent of colabeled EYFP+/Arc+ cells was significantly greater in mice re-exposed to context A than to context B (Figure 3E) (p < 0.0001). We confirmed these results by using c-fos to label the cells activated during memory expression. The percent of colabeled EYFP+/c-fos+ DG cells was likewise significantly greater in mice re-exposed to context A than to context B (data not shown). The fact that we obtained similar results with c-fos, as with Arc, is consistent with the fact that there is approximately an 80% overlap between Arc+ and c-fos+ in the DG cells following behavioral testing (Stone et al., 2011Stone S.S. Teixeira C.M. Zaslavsky K. Wheeler A.L. Martinez-Canabal A. Wang A.H. Sakaguchi M. Lozano A.M. Frankland P.W. Functional convergence of developmentally and adult-generated granule cells in dentate gyrus circuits supporting hippocampus-dependent memory.Hippocampus. 2011; 21: 1348-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To assess reactivation in CA3, we used c-fos, rather than Arc, because Arc labeling in CA3 is primarily dendritic (Figure S3). Like in the DG, in CA3, the number of EYFP+ (Figure 3F) and c-fos+ (Figure 3G) cells was similar between the groups, while the percent of colabeled EYFP+/c-fos+ was significantly greater in mice re-exposed to context A than to context B (Figure 3H) (p = 0.03). Interestingly, levels of activity during encoding (number of EYFP+ cells; for recent DG versus CA3: p < 0.001; for remote DG versus CA3: p < 0.001) are higher in the DG than in CA3, which may reflect a preferential role of the DG in encoding (Kheirbek et al., 2013Kheirbek M.A. Drew L.J. Burghardt N.S. Costantini D.O. Tannenholz L. Ahmari S.E. Zeng H. Fenton A.A. Hen R.

Encoding versus retrieval of spatial memory: double dissociation between the dentate gyrus and the perforant path inputs into CA3 in the dorsal hippocampus.Hippocampus. 2004; 14: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Second, we assessed the effect of time on reactivation by re-exposing the mice to contexts A or B 30 days after encoding (rather than 5 days). During remote exposure, mice froze to a similar high degree in both contexts A and B (Figure 3B) (F(1,9) = 1.217, p = 0.30), which is indicative of memory generalization (Frankland et al., 2006Frankland P.W.

Dynamics of retrieval strategies for remote memories.Cell. 2011; 147: 678-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In the DG, the two groups neither differed in the number of EYFP+ (Figure 3I) or Arc+ (Figure 3J) cells nor in the percent of colabeled EYFP+/Arc+ cells (Figure 3K). In CA3, the number of EYFP+ (Figure 3L) and c-fos+ (Figure 3M) cells and the percent of colabeled EYFP+/c-fos+ were also similar in both groups of mice (Figure 3N). However, there was a trend for a decrease in the percent of colabeled EYFP+/c-fos+ cells in context A at the remote time point when compared with the recent time point (1.63% versus 4.04%; p = 0.1). The fact that memory remains strong, while reactivation in CA3 decreases, is consistent with the observation that after 4 weeks, HPC memories are redistributed to cortical areas (Frankland et al., 2006Frankland P.W.

To determine whether the cells labeled during CFC are necessary for the behavioral expression of contextual fear, ArcCreERT2 mice were bred with the optogenetic inhibitory line R26R-CAG-STOP-floxed-Archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch)-GFP (Ai35) (Figures 4, 5, and S4). In whole-cell recordings from ex vivo brain slices, photostimulation (593.5 nm) of Arch-GFP+ DG granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons elicited a robust and sustained hyperpolarizing current that effectively blocked spiking evoked by current injection (Figure 4B–4J).Figure 5In Vivo Optogenetic Inhibition of the DG and CA3 Impairs Expression of Initially Encoded MemoryShow full caption(A) Genetic design.(B–D) Representative images of the (B) hippocampus (the scale bar represents 200 μm), (C) DG (the scale bar represents 100 μm), and (D) CA3 (the scale bar represents 100 μm).(E) The experimental design consisted of all mice being trained in four-shock CFC paradigm and then being re-exposed to context A and B Each context exposure consisted of 3 min of laser stimulation and 3 min without laser stimulation.(F and G) Optogenetic inhibition of Arch-GFP+ DG neurons impaired expression of the corresponding fear memory in context A (F) in ArcCreERT2(+) mice when compared with ArcCreERT2(−) mice (p = 0.02) but had no effect in (G) context B (n = 6–9 mice per group).(H and I) Optogenetic inhibition of Arch-GFP+ CA3 neurons impaired expression of the corresponding fear memory in context A (H) in ArcCreERT2(+) mice when compared with ArcCreERT2(−) mice (p < 0.02) but had no effect in (I) context B (n = 9–12 mice per group).(J–L) Experimental design.

Error bars represent ± SEM. See also Figures S4 and S5. We optogenetically inhibited DG or CA3 cells that were labeled during CFC encoding to assess their impact on subsequent memory expression. ArcCreERT2 x Arch-GFP mice were implanted with fiber optics directly above the DG or CA3, and 2 weeks later, mice were injected with TAM and administered CFC in context A 5 hr later (Figure 5E). Two weeks later, mice were placed back into context A for 6 min. The first 3 min of context A exposure were with light ON (593.5 nm, constant light, 15 mW), and the following 3 min were with light OFF. Two days later, mice were placed into a novel context B with the same light epochs. When comparing minute 1 (light ON) and minute 4 (light OFF), optogenetic inhibition of DG neurons impaired expression of the fear memory as evidenced by the lower percent of freezing in context A in ArcCreERT2(+) mice when compared with ArcCreERT2(−) mice (Figure 5F) (p = 0.02). We additionally performed analyses of the minutes 1–3 (light ON) versus minutes 4–6 (light OFF), which gave similar results (repeated measures ANOVA, genotype effect, F(1,13) = 3.682, p = 0.08; light ON/OFF effect, F(1,13) = 36.646, p < 0.0001; genotype x light ON/OFF, F(1,13) = 13.681, p = 0.0027, unpaired t test for light ON: p = 0.0093, unpaired t test for light OFF: p = 0.68). Notably, when optogenetic inhibition ceased, freezing levels were comparable in both groups (Figure 5F) (repeated measures ANOVA, genotype effect, F(1,13) = 6.965, p = 0.02; light ON/OFF effect, F(1,13) = 56.910; p < 0.0001; genotype x light ON/OFF, F(1,13) = 4.973, p = 0.04). In context B, the effect of optogenetic inhibition was not significant (Figure 5G). Similar effects were seen in mice with fiber optics implanted directly above CA3. When comparing minute 1 (light ON) and minute 4 (light OFF), optogenetic inhibition of CA3 neurons impaired expression of the corresponding fear memory in context A (Figure 5H) (repeated measures ANOVA, genotype effect, F(1,19) = 6.928, p < 0.02; light ON/OFF effect, F(1,19) = 51.709; p < 0.0001; genotype x light ON/OFF, F(1,19) = 2.054, p = 0.17, planned comparisons: p < 0.02) but had no effect in context B (Figure 5I). The effect did not reach significance when we performed analyses of the minutes 1–3 (light ON) versus minutes 4–6 (light OFF) (repeated measures ANOVA, genotype effect, F(1,19) = 1.848, p = 0.19; light ON/OFF effect, F(1,19) = 38.373, p < 0.0001; genotype x light ON/OFF, F(1,19) = 3.216, p = 0.09; planned comparison for light ON, p = 0.14). These results were further supported in an independent experiment in which we used halorhodopsin, which primarily labels cell bodies, instead of Arch, to silence CA3 cells (comparison of minute 1 [light ON] versus minute 4 [light OFF]: repeated measures ANOVA, genotype effect, F(1,16) = 5.278, p = 0.04; light ON/OFF effect, F(1,16) = 3.912; p = 0.07; genotype x light ON/OFF, F(1,16) = 5.073, p = 0.04) (Figure S5). Moreover, the effect did reach significance when we performed analyses of the minutes 1–3 (light ON) versus minutes 4–6 (light OFF) (repeated measures ANOVA, genotype effect, F(1,16) = 5.176, p = 0.04; light ON/OFF effect, F(1,16) = 1.360, p = 0.2606; genotype x light ON/OFF, F(1,16) = 2.523, p = 0.13; planned comparison for light ON, p = 0.0085, planned comparison for light OFF, p = 0.24). Therefore, it is likely that the optogenetic inhibition we see in the DG and CA3 is due to inhibition of the corresponding neurons rather than inhibition of axon terminals or passing fibers. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that inhibition of axons contributes to the phenotype we see in the DG and CA3. In summary, these experiments suggest that the DG and CA3 neurons that are active during encoding of a CFC memory are necessary for the expression of that memory. To test for the specificity of the cells involved in this memory suppression, we assessed the effect of silencing a population of cells unrelated to the CFC memory. Mice were again injected with TAM but 5 hr later were placed in a larger novel environment C in the absence of a foot shock; such conditions recruit a similar number of cells as CFC (Figure 5J). One week later, mice were exposed to CFC in context A without TAM, and one week later, mice were exposed to contexts A and B as above. When comparing minute 1 (light ON) and minute 4 (light OFF), optogenetic inhibition of DG neurons labeled in context C did not impair freezing in either context A (Figure 5K) (repeated measures ANOVA, genotype effect, F(1,7) = 0.660, p = 0.44; light ON/OFF effect, F(1,7) = 16.316; p = 0.0049; genotype x light ON/OFF, F(1,7) = 0.420, p = 0.54) or B (Figure 5L). Similarly, when comparing minute 1 (light ON) and minute 4 (light OFF), optogenetic inhibition of CA3 neurons labeled in context C had no effect on memory expression in either context A (Figure 5M) (repeated measures ANOVA, genotype effect, F(1,8) = 1.001, p = 0.35; light ON/OFF effect, F(1,8) = 27.231; p = 0.0008; genotype x light ON/OFF, F(1,8) = 0.0489, p = 0.50) or B (Figure 5N). In another control experiment, we implanted fiber optics in a more medial and more dorsal position, which resides right above dorsal CA2 and reaches therefore only a small fraction of CA3 (Figure S4). When comparing minute 1 (light ON) and minute 4 (light OFF), optogenetic inhibition of this region did not impair expression of the CFC memory in context A (Figure S4F) or in context B (Figure S4G), suggesting that a partial CA3 suppression is not sufficient for memory inhibition. Taken together, these optogenetic experiments suggest that the DG and CA3 cells recruited during CFC encoding are necessary for memory expression and are therefore a component of this fearful memory trace. Adult neurogenesis, a process in which new neurons are continuously generated in adulthood, occurs in the subgranular zone of the DG and in the subventricular zone of the olfactory bulb. Adult-born DG neurons functionally integrate into the hippocampal circuit, are activated during HPC-dependent learning, and exhibit heightened synaptic plasticity (Ge et al., 2006Ge S. Goh E.L.

A variety of studies have assessed the influence of adult neurogenesis on behavior by utilizing loss- (Saxe et al., 2006Saxe M.D. Battaglia F. Wang J.W. Malleret G. David D.J. Monckton J.E.

Increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve pattern separation.Nature. 2011; 472: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the impact of adult neurogenesis on long-term memory encoding and memory expression are unknown. Therefore, we used x-irradiation to ablate adult-born hippocampal neurons in ArcCreERT2 x EYFP mice and tested these mice 6 weeks later, because this time point is within the critical period during which adult-born neurons contribute to behavior (Figure 6A) (Denny et al., 2012Denny C.A. Burghardt N.S. Schachter D.M. Hen R. Drew M.R. 4- to 6-week-old adult-born hippocampal neurons influence novelty-evoked exploration and contextual fear conditioning.Hippocampus. 2012; 22: 1188-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We previously showed that mice with ablated neurogenesis are impaired in single-trial CFC, but not in multiple-trial CFC, suggesting that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is required for CFC only when brief training is provided (Drew et al., 2010Drew M.R. Denny C.A. Hen R. Arrest of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice impairs single- but not multiple-trial contextual fear conditioning.Behav. Neurosci. 2010; 124: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In keeping with these previous studies, in the one-shock CFC paradigm, x-irradiated mice exhibited significantly less context-elicited freezing when compared with sham mice (F(1,22) = 4.509, p < 0.05) (Figures 6B–6D). In the DG, the number of EYFP+ (Figure 6E) and Arc+ cells (Figure 6F) and the percent of colabeled EYFP+/Arc+ (Figure 6G) were comparable in sham and x-irradiated mice. In contrast, in CA3, although sham and x-irradiated mice had similar levels of EYFP+ (Figure 6H) and c-fos+ (Figure 6I) cells, the percent of EYFP+/c-fos+ cells was significantly lower in x-irradiated mice than in sham mice (Figure 6J) (p < 0.01). These data suggest that the behavioral impairments exhibited by x-irradiated mice may be due to altered reactivation in CA3 rather than in the DG. Interestingly, when a three-shock CFC was used, there was no longer any difference between sham and x-irradiated mice, both in freezing and in reactivation in the DG and CA3, indicating that a strong training paradigm can rescue the deficit that results from an absence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Figures 6K–6P). We also used a social defeat (SD) paradigm to induce a depressive-like state and to decrease adult hippocampal neurogenesis in ArcCreERT2 x EYFP mice (Figure S6). When compared with control mice, SD mice were impaired in dominant interaction, exhibited increased time with a novel object, spent less time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, and displayed increased immobility in the tail-suspension test. The number of BrdU+ cells was significantly reduced in SD mice in the most ventral DG sections (p < 0.01). These data show that SD produces a robust submissive and depressive-like phenotype in the ArcCreERT2 mice. Ten days after the cessation of SD, control and SD mice were administered a one-shock CFC paradigm, and memory traces were analyzed (Figure 7). In these conditions, like in x-irradiated mice, we observed a memory deficit in the one-shock CFC paradigm, as well as a decreased reactivation in CA3, but not in the DG. Overall, our combined data suggest that the level of reactivation in CA3, rather than in the DG, is related to the strength of the memory trace (Table 1).

However, how well such models correspond to in vivo brain has not been evaluated in an unbiased, comprehensive manner. We used transcriptomic analyses to compare in vitro systems to developing human fetal brain and observed strong conservation of in vivo gene expression and network architecture in differentiating primary human neural progenitor cells (phNPCs). Conserved modules are enriched in genes associated with ASD, supporting the utility of phNPCs for studying neuropsychiatric disease. We also developed and validated a machine learning approach called CoNTExT that identifies the developmental maturity and regional identity of in vitro models. We observed strong differences between in vitro models, including hiPSC-derived neural progenitors from multiple laboratories. This work provides a systems biology framework for evaluating in vitro systems and supports their value in studying the molecular mechanisms of human neurodevelopmental disease."

To date, knowledge of gene expression changes accompanying corticogenesis is largely based on murine data. Here we present a searchable, comprehensive, temporal gene expression data set encompassing cerebral cortical development from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Using a modified differentiation protocol that yields neurons suggestive of prefrontal cortex, we identified sets of genes and long noncoding RNAs that significantly change during corticogenesis and those enriched for disease-associations. Numerous alternatively spliced genes with varying temporal patterns of expression are revealed, including TGIF1, involved in holoprosencephaly, and MARK1, involved in autism. We have created a database (http://cortecon.neuralsci.org/) that provides online, query-based access to changes in RNA expression and alternatively spliced transcripts during human cortical development."
https://openalex.org/W1995051993,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. The debilitating choreic movements that plague HD patients have been attributed to striatal degeneration induced by the loss of cortically supplied brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here, we show that in mouse models of early symptomatic HD, BDNF delivery to the striatum and its activation of tyrosine-related kinase B (TrkB) receptors were normal. However, in striatal neurons responsible for movement suppression, TrkB receptors failed to properly engage postsynaptic signaling mechanisms controlling the induction of potentiation at corticostriatal synapses. Plasticity was rescued by inhibiting p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) signaling or its downstream target phosphatase-and-tensin-homolog-deleted-on-chromosome-10 (PTEN). Thus, corticostriatal synaptic dysfunction early in HD is attributable to a correctable defect in the response to BDNF, not its delivery."

https://openalex.org/W2065260379,"Drosophila melanogaster females respond to male courtship by either rejecting the male or allowing copulation. The neural mechanisms underlying these female behaviors likely involve the integration of sensory information in the brain. Because doublesex (dsx) controls other aspects of female differentiation, we asked whether dsx-expressing neurons mediate virgin female receptivity to courting males. Using intersectional techniques to manipulate the activities of defined subsets of dsx-expressing neurons, we found that activation of neurons in either the pCd or pC1 clusters promotes receptivity, while silencing these neurons makes females unreceptive. Furthermore, pCd and pC1 neurons physiologically respond to the male-specific pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA), while pC1 neurons also respond to male courtship song. The pCd and pC1 neurons expressing dsx in females do not express transcripts from the fruitless (fru) P1 promoter. Thus, virgin female receptivity is controlled at least in part by neurons that are distinct from those governing male courtship."
https://openalex.org/W2088330265,"Mating induces pronounced changes in female reproductive behavior, typically including a dramatic reduction in sexual receptivity. In Drosophila, postmating behavioral changes are triggered by sex peptide (SP), a male seminal fluid peptide that acts via a receptor (SPR) expressed in sensory neurons (SPSNs) of the female reproductive tract. Here, we identify second-order neurons that mediate the behavioral changes induced by SP. These SAG neurons receive synaptic input from SPSNs in the abdominal ganglion and project to the dorsal protocerebrum. Silencing SAG neurons renders virgin females unreceptive, whereas activating them increases the receptivity of females that have already mated. Physiological experiments demonstrate that SP downregulates the excitability of the SPSNs, and hence their input onto SAG neurons. These data thus provide a physiological correlate of mating status in the female central nervous system and a key entry point into the brain circuits that control sexual receptivity."

Our data suggest that distracting stimuli can be bypassed by storing and retrieving target information, emphasizing active maintenance processes during working memory with complementary functions for frontal and parietal cortex in controlling memory content. Cognitive control involves the grouping of stimuli into meaningful categories, online storage in working memory, and selection of behaviorally relevant over irrelevant information (Baddeley, 2012Baddeley A. Working memory: theories, models, and controversies.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2012; 63: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). Because working memory has a limited capacity, relevant information needs to be protected against distracting representations (Luck and Vogel, 1997Luck S.J. Vogel E.K. The capacity of visual working memory for features and conjunctions.Nature. 1997; 390: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (2838) Google Scholar, Vogel et al., 2005Vogel E.K. McCollough A.W. Machizawa M.G. Neural measures reveal individual differences in controlling access to working memory.Nature. 2005; 438: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are thought to be the major nodes that enable us to selectively attend to target stimuli while filtering distracting information. A large body of experimental evidence suggests that PFC and PPC adopt specialized functions in working memory and selective attention. PPC neurons represent the most recent stimulus irrespective of its relevance to the current task (Constantinidis and Steinmetz, 1996Constantinidis C. Steinmetz M.A. Neuronal activity in posterior parietal area 7a during the delay periods of a spatial memory task.J.

In contrast, PFC has been associated with controlling lower-level visual areas and gating access to working memory (Anderson and Green, 2001Anderson M.C. Green C.

Contribution of human prefrontal cortex to delay performance.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Responses of single PFC neurons in the monkey are diminished for unattended targets (Everling et al., 2002Everling S. Tinsley C.J. Gaffan D. Duncan J. Filtering of neural signals by focused attention in the monkey prefrontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Compared to parietal cells, PFC neurons respond little to the presentation of distractors (di Pellegrino and Wise, 1993di Pellegrino G. Wise S.P.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These studies collectively suggest that attentional filtering performance in primates relies on the ability of PFC neurons to suppress interfering stimuli. Our current knowledge of the resistance to memory interference stems from experiments that measured neuronal responses to comparatively simple spatial stimuli placed in the visual periphery. Thus, there is currently insufficient data to determine whether prefrontal inhibition of distractors is a general principle of cognitive functioning or rather restricted to particular situations. Specifically, it is unknown whether prefrontal suppression of interfering stimuli is found when more complex features that typically drive PFC neurons, such as abstract cognitive categories, have to be filtered. To investigate the neuronal mechanisms of maintaining abstract category information in the light of interference, we trained two rhesus monkeys to memorize the number of visual items (numerosity) while resisting other distracting numerosities. We then simultaneously recorded single-unit activity from the PFC and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP) of the PPC, two key areas for numerosity processing that contain high proportions of quantity-selective neurons (Nieder and Miller, 2004Nieder A.

USA. 2004; 101: 7457-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, Nieder et al., 2002Nieder A. Freedman D.J. Miller E.K.

We considered two hypotheses. Task-irrelevant distractor numerosities could be processed primarily by parietal neurons, whereas prefrontal neurons might remain largely unaffected by interfering information. Alternatively, PFC target representations could break down in the face of strong distracting stimulation, possibly requiring this area to regenerate target information following the interference to solve the task. We found evidence for the latter. PFC readily represented the distractor but subsequently recovered target information, while, surprisingly, target memories were maintained to a significantly greater extent in VIP neurons. Our results differ from previous studies by showing that neuronal suppression of interfering stimuli in PFC is not necessary to overcome distractors, and suggest different mechanisms by which the frontoparietal network controls working memory content to guide goal-directed behavior. Two monkeys performed a modified version of a delayed-match-to-numerosity task (Nieder et al., 2002Nieder A. Freedman D.J. Miller E.K. Representation of the quantity of visual items in the primate prefrontal cortex.Science. 2002; 297: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) (sample numerosities 1–4), in which a task-irrelevant, interfering numerosity was embedded in the working memory period (Figure 1A). The 500-ms-duration interfering stimulus (ranging from 1 to 4 items) was presented during the memory interval on 80% of the trials (20% of the trials each with numerosity 1, 2, 3, and 4). In the remaining 20% of the trials, a blank gray background circle of equal duration replaced the interfering numerosity, i.e., no task-irrelevant stimulus was shown (standard delayed-match-to-numerosity task). These trials served as control trials. Low-level visual features were controlled and could not systematically influence task performance (Nieder et al., 2002Nieder A. Freedman D.J. Miller E.K. Representation of the quantity of visual items in the primate prefrontal cortex.Science. 2002; 297: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Both animals had previously received extensive training in the standard delayed-match-to-numerosity task (Nieder et al., 2006Nieder A. Diester I. Tudusciuc O. Temporal and spatial enumeration processes in the primate parietal cortex.Science. 2006; 313: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Within 3 to 5 months of gradually introducing the interfering numerosity, performance also stabilized in these trials (see Experimental Procedures). As expected, performance in trials with interfering stimuli was lower compared to control trials (monkey R: 71% ± 0.5% versus 79% ± 0.6% [n = 47 sessions], p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Figure 1B; monkey W: 67% ± 0.5% versus 84% ± 0.8% [n = 31 sessions], p < 0.001, Figure 1G). Importantly, both animals performed significantly above chance level in trials with interfering stimuli (p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, for monkey R, Figure 1B, and monkey W, Figure 1G). Successful filtering of the interfering stimulus was evident in match trials where the interfering numerosity differed from the sample and test numerosity (Figure 1A, upper trial branch; monkey R: 71% ± 0.7%, p < 0.001 versus chance level, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; monkey W: 71% ± 1.0%, p < 0.001). The reduction in performance induced by the interfering numerosity was most pronounced in these trials (monkey R: −11%, monkey W: −23% compared to control match trials). Performance decreased to a smaller extent in all other trial types (e.g., in nonmatch trials where the interfering numerosity matched the first test stimulus; Figure 1A, lower trial branch; monkey R: −6%, monkey W: −13% compared to control nonmatch trials). The reduction in performance was in the range of and comparable to recent studies using other interfering stimuli (Lennert and Martinez-Trujillo, 2011Lennert T. Martinez-Trujillo J. Strength of response suppression to distracter stimuli determines attentional-filtering performance in primate prefrontal neurons.Neuron. 2011; 70: 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Suzuki and Gottlieb, 2013Suzuki M. Gottlieb J. Distinct neural mechanisms of distractor suppression in the frontal and parietal lobe.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Finally, there were almost no trials in which the animals mistakenly responded to the task-irrelevant stimulus instead of to the first test numerosity, which was marked by a red ring (monkey R: < 0.01%, monkey W: < 0.2%; Figure 1A). Collectively, these results showed that both animals had learned to respond to the sample numerosity despite memory interference by the task-irrelevant stimulus. To quantify the precision of sample representation in working memory, we plotted the extent to which animals judged the test as equal in number to the sample as a function of the numerical distance between test and sample numerosity. Peaked curves were obtained in trials with interfering stimuli, as in control trials, which confirmed that both animals continued to correctly compare the test to the sample despite the presence of the interfering numerosity (Figures 1C, 1D, 1H, and 1I). The impact of the interfering stimulus on performance depended on its numerosity. A small increase in performance was observed when the interfering stimulus was equal in number to, i.e., repeated, the sample numerosity (“repeat-sample trials”) (Figures 1C and 1H). Compared to control trials, performance curves were slightly sharper in repeat-sample trials (monkey R: ▵ sigma [difference of performance curve widths] −0.03 ± 0.01, p < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Figure 1E; monkey W: ▵ sigma −0.06 ± 0.02, p < 0.001, Figure 1J). In contrast, the monkeys made more errors when the interfering numerosity was unrelated to the sample, i.e., a true distractor (Figures 1D and 1I). Compared to control trials, behavioral performance curves were wider in distractor trials (monkey R: ▵ sigma 0.18 ± 0.01, p < 0.001, Figure 1E; monkey W: ▵ sigma 0.39 ± 0.02, p < 0.001, Figure 1J), indicating more errors on trials in which sample and interfering numerosity differed. As a second behavioral parameter, we analyzed reaction times (RTs), which were shorter in repeat-sample trials compared to control trials (monkey R: ▵ RT −37 ± 4 ms, p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Figure 1F; monkey W: ▵ RT −43 ± 5 ms, p < 0.001, Figure 1K) and increased in true distractor trials (monkey R: ▵ RT 30 ± 3 ms, p < 0.001, Figure 1F; monkey W: ▵ RT 122 ± 5 ms, p < 0.001, Figure 1K). Thus, the monkeys’ errors were not the result of a general lack of understanding of the task but instead reflected the power of an interfering numerosity to specifically compete with the sample for representation in working memory. For simplicity, the interfering stimulus (comprising both repetitions of the sample and true distractors) will from now on be referred to as the distractor. We simultaneously recorded single-unit activity from lateral PFC (n = 473; 319 from monkey R, 154 from monkey W) and parietal VIP (n = 386; 278 from monkey R, 108 from monkey W) while the monkeys performed the task (Figures 2A–2E). Almost all neurons in both areas significantly modulated their firing rate during the course of the trial (task-related neurons; one-way ANOVA across trial epochs, evaluated at p < 0.05; PFC: n = 448 [95%]; VIP: n = 361 [94%]); Figures 2F and 2G, left). Of these task-related neurons, a large proportion encoded the sample and/or distractor numerosity in at least one trial epoch (two-way ANOVA with factors sample [1–4] and distractor numerosity [1–4], evaluated at p < 0.01; PFC: total n = 234 [52%]; VIP: total n = 130 [36%]); Figures 2F and 2G, right; see Table S1 for details). The proportion of number-selective neurons in PFC and VIP observed here was comparable to and even exceeded results from previous studies (Nieder et al., 2002Nieder A. Freedman D.J. Miller E.K.

We quantified how much information about the sample and distractor numerosity was carried by the discharge rates of the entire population of task-related PFC and VIP neurons (ω2 explained variance) (Buschman et al., 2011Buschman T.J.

Miller E.K. The representation of multiple objects in prefrontal neuronal delay activity.Cereb.

In PFC, sample information increased sharply after sample presentation and reached a second peak immediately prior to distractor presentation (Figure 2H). Surprisingly, sample information then strongly decreased (sample percent explained variance [ω2 PEV] in 100 ms windows after distractor onset and offset: 2.1 ± 0.2 versus 0.8 ± 0.1, respectively, p < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and was largely replaced during the distractor period by information about the distractor stimulus (bin-wise Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figure 2H). Distractor information reached peak levels comparable to previous maximal values for sample information. In the second memory period, i.e., after distractor offset, sample information recovered but was paralleled by increasing distractor information, i.e., sample and distractor numerosity were represented to the same extent (Figure 2H). A different picture emerged for VIP, where information about the sample numerosity was maintained throughout the trial (sample ω2 PEV in 100 ms windows after distractor onset and offset: 1.0 ± 0.1 versus 1.0 ± 0.1, respectively, p = 0.93, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figure 2I). Sample information in VIP was always larger than for the distractor, even during distractor presentation (bin-wise Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figure 2I). Moreover, VIP activity clearly favored the sample over the distractor numerosity during the second memory period prior to presentation of the test stimulus. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the distractor numerosity had a more disturbing effect on maintenance of sample information in prefrontal cortex, not posterior parietal cortex. Because the distractor numerosity systematically influenced the animals’ behavior (Figure 1), we performed the analysis of sample information separately for repeat-sample, control (blank), and true distractor trials (Figures 2J and 2K). In both areas, sample information in the second memory period was greatest for repeat-sample trials (facilitation), while true distractors reduced sample information below the level of control trials (Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; inset in Figures 2J and 2K). To gain further insight into the temporal dynamics of the recorded neuronal populations, we asked how individual numerosities were represented across time. We therefore decomposed ensemble activity in PFC and VIP using multidimensional state-space analysis (neuronal circuit trajectories) (Harvey et al., 2012Harvey C.D. Coen P. Tank D.W. Choice-specific sequences in parietal cortex during a virtual-navigation decision task.Nature. 2012; 484: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, Stokes et al., 2013Stokes M.G. Kusunoki M. Sigala N. Nili H. Gaffan D. Duncan J. Dynamic coding for cognitive control in prefrontal cortex.Neuron. 2013; 78: 364-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) (Figures 3A and 3B ). At each point in time, the activity of n recorded neurons can be defined by a point in n-dimensional space, with each dimension representing the activity of a single neuron. Different trajectories are traversed for different neuronal states, i.e., they represent the encoding of different stimuli in working memory. Dimensionality is effectively reduced using factor analysis. We first sorted trials by sample numerosity. Prefrontal trajectories separated after presentation of the sample and parametrically spanned state space as a function of sample numerosity (Figure 3A); adjacent numerosities were represented by adjacent trajectories, forming an ordered layout of neuronal states. Thus, similar target numerosities were laid down in similar patterns of neuronal ensemble activity. Trajectories in PFC were maximally separated after the first memory delay, but collapsed almost completely when the distractor was presented (compare time points four and five). Separation partially returned in the second memory delay. Population activity in VIP initially followed a similar time course (Figure 3B). Notably, however, the distance between sample trajectories was reduced to a lesser extent in the distractor period (compare time points four and five). The layout of sample trajectories in state space reflected two characteristics of the analog representation of quantities: the distance between two trajectories scaled with the numerical distance between their corresponding numerosities (distance effect); at equal numerical distances, two trajectories were closer as the magnitudes of their corresponding numerosities increased (magnitude effect) (Nieder, 2013Nieder A. Coding of abstract quantity by ‘number neurons’ of the primate brain.J. Comp. Physiol. A Neuroethol. Sens. Neural Behav. Physiol. 2013; 199: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Figures 3C and 3D). We used the mean intertrajectory distance (▵d) as a proxy for the strength of neuronal selectivity for a stimulus (Figures 3E and 3F). Trajectories were calculated using trials sorted either by sample or by distractor numerosity (Figures S2A and S2B). PFC ensemble activity strongly encoded the sample numerosity until the distractor period, when the distractor started to override the sample numerosity (at distractor peak bin: sample ▵d 0.25 ± 0.08, distractor ▵d 0.71 ± 0.23, p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Figure 3E). This prominent reversal was not observed in VIP (at distractor peak bin: sample ▵d 0.33 ± 0.12, distractor ▵d 0.33 ± 0.14, p = 1.0, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Unlike in PFC, VIP sample trajectories diverged significantly more than distractor trajectories in the second memory period (mean across time bins: PFC, sample ▵d 0.24 ± 0.08, distractor ▵d 0.24 ± 0.07, p = 1.0, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; VIP, sample ▵d 0.37 ± 0.13, distractor ▵d 0.06 ± 0.09, p < 0.05; Figures 3E and 3F). Distractor trajectories were equally well described in state space defined by sample or distractor numerosities (Figures S2C and S2D). To further quantify the trajectory divergence, we used a classifier based on the distance from an individual trial trajectory to the mean sample and distractor trajectories at individual time points (Figures S3Aa and S3B). It was possible to decode from PFC population activity in single correct trials the numerosity currently held in memory at better than chance levels in all trial periods (Figure S3A). Following distractor presentation, it was more likely to correctly decode the distractor than the sample numerosity in PFC. Single-trial classification accuracy was lower in VIP but, importantly, higher for the sample compared to the distractor throughout the trial (Figure S3B). These results show that ensemble activity in PFC and VIP can be described using divergent, numerosity-specific trajectories through state space and provide support for the explained variance data (Figures 2H and 2I) using a conceptually distinct analysis. We next determined whether the observed population responses were obtained by averaging over heterogeneous groups of neurons or whether they reflected the activity of typical single units (Figure S4). A representative prefrontal neuron increased its firing rate when either the sample or distractor numerosity was presented (Figure 4A). When trials were sorted by sample, firing rates in this cell diverged during the sample period, but not during the distractor period (Figure 4A, top panel). Conversely, activity levels discriminated distractor, but not sample, numerosities when trials were sorted by distractor (Figure 4A, bottom panel). Thus, this neuron encoded the most recently presented stimulus, irrespective of its relevance for solving the task (Figure 4B). Another example PFC neuron increased its firing rate primarily during the memory periods (Figures 4C and 4D). In this neuron, distractor information temporarily replaced the memory of the sample numerosity. VIP neurons that encoded the distractor were rare (see Figures S5A and S5B for an example). Typical single neurons in this area encoded the sample numerosity at various stages of the trial, including during the presentation of the distractor, but never represented the distracting stimulus (Figures 4E–4H). We explored the time course of sample or distractor selectivity for all task-related single neurons in both areas (sliding-window analysis of explained variance; Figure 5). Similar to previous studies (Nieder and Miller, 2004Nieder A. Miller E.K. A parieto-frontal network for visual numerical information in the monkey.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 7457-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, Viswanathan and Nieder, 2013Viswanathan P. Nieder A.

USA. 2013; 110: 11187-11192Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), VIP neurons represented sample numerosities on average earlier than PFC neurons (VIP: 158 ± 4 ms, PFC: 171 ± 1 ms; Figure S6), although this result did not reach statistical significance in the present data set (p = 0.47, Wilcoxon rank sum test). A total of 209 individual PFC neurons reached the criteria for sample selectivity at some point during the trial (see Experimental Procedures). A total of 110 PFC neurons represented the distractor (inset, Figure 5A). Note that the number of time bins during which a neuron might become selective for the sample was twice that for the distractor. In VIP, 144 neurons represented the sample, and only 23 neurons represented the distractor (inset, Figure 5B). Significantly more neurons encoded both the sample and the distractor in PFC compared to VIP (n = 80/209 versus n = 15/144, p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test). To integrate sample and distractor preference into a single measure, we calculated a time-resolved stimulus selectivity index (SSI) for all sample-selective neurons: positive values indicate that the neuron’s firing-rate variance is better explained by differences in the sample numerosity, and negative values indicate that the neuron’s activity correlates better with the distractor (SSI values were normalized to the maximum for illustration purposes) (Figures 5C and 5D). In PFC, the distractor was encoded by neurons that became sample selective at various di"

A key effector of Akt is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Akt is known to stimulate mTORC1 activity through phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) and PRAS40, both negative regulators of mTOR activity. We previously reported that IκB kinase α (IKKα), a component of the kinase complex that leads to NF-κB activation, plays an important role in promoting mTORC1 activity downstream of activated Akt. Here, we demonstrate IKKα-dependent regulation of mTORC1 using multiple PTEN null cancer cell lines and an animal model with deletion of IKKα. Importantly, IKKα is shown to phosphorylate mTOR at serine 1415 in a manner dependent on Akt to promote mTORC1 activity.

Due to clinical importance and a further understanding of key metabolic and growth signaling events, dissection of the pathways regulating mTOR is essential. Dysregulation of the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (PKB) underlies the pathology of many human diseases. In cancers, Akt is constitutively activated through activating mutations in PI3K through up-regulated receptor-tyrosine kinase activation or after mutation or loss of PTEN (13.Shaw R.J. Cantley L.C.

These findings considerably widen our knowledge of the biological roles of these kinases and indicate that a full understanding of the roles of IKKα and IKKβ will require the identification of key phosphorylation targets and the impact of these events on cell growth and metabolism. IκB kinase tuberous sclerosis complex 2. We previously reported that IKKα associates with the mTORC1 complex to regulate mTORC1 kinase activity directed to S6K and 4E-BP1 in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells in an Akt-dependent manner (37.Dan H.C. Adli M. Baldwin A.S. Regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin activity in PTEN-inactive prostate cancer cells by IKKα.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6263-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When IKKα is induced to interact with mTORC1, mTOR reciprocally activates IKK and NF-κB activity (38.Dan H.C. Cooper M.J. Cogswell P.C. Duncan J.A. Ting J.P. Baldwin A.S. Akt-dependent regulation of NF-κB is controlled by mTOR and Raptor in association with IKK.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1490-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Importantly, Hung and co-workers (31.Lee D.F. Kuo H.P. Chen C.T. Hsu J.M. Chou C.K. Wei Y. Sun H.L. Li L.Y. Ping B. Huang W.C. He X. Hung J.Y. Lai C.C. Ding Q. Su J.L. Yang J.Y. Sahin A.A.

Additionally, we showed that IKKα is important for efficient induction of mTORC1 activity downstream of insulin and TNFα in an Akt-dependent manner (39.Dan H.C. Baldwin A.S.

Taken together, these results indicate that IKKα is directed to control mTORC1 activity after exposure of cells to growth factors and cytokines and in response to Akt activation. Here we address a mechanism to explain the ability of IKKα to activate mTORC1 in the Akt pathway. Data are presented which show that mTOR is a direct substrate for the kinase activity of IKKα, targeting Ser-1415 in mTOR. Phosphorylation of mTOR controlled by IKKα is shown in multiple PTEN null cancer cell lines and in animal with deletion of IKKα. The phosphorylation of mTOR by IKKα promotes mTORC1 kinase activity and reduced affinity between Raptor and mTOR, previously shown to correlate with active mTORC1 (40.Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M.

All cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol/liter glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfections were done using Polyfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) or Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. 3–4 h after transfection, cells were recovered in full serum for 36 h or in full serum for 24 h and then serum-starved for 16–24 h as indicated.

Immunoprecipitates were washed twice by lysis buffer, twice by wash buffer B (20 mmol/liter Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 20 mmol/liter β-glycerophosphate, 5 mmol/liter EGTA, 1 mmol/liter DTT, 1 mmol/liter orthovanadate, 40 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin), once with wash buffer C (10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mmol/liter glycerophosphate, 50 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter DTT, 1 mmol/liter orthovanadate, 40 mg/ml PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin), and once with mTOR kinase assay buffer without ATP (10 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mmol/liter NaCl, 50 mmol/liter glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/liter DTT, 10 mmol/liter MgCl2, 4 mmol/liter MnCl2). Kinase assay toward recombinant GST-S6K1 (amino acids 308–400) in washed immunoprecipitates was done for 30 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of mTOR kinase buffer with 100 μmol/liter ATP unlabeled and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To stop the reaction, 6 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer was added to each reaction, which was boiled for 10 min. The reaction was then separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. 32P incorporated into GST-S6K was assessed by autoradiography. In a cold in vitro kinase assay to GST-S6K, phosphorylation S6K was detected by phosphor-S6K-Thr-389 antibody. To map the phosphorylation sites in mTOR, the fragments of the mTOR coding sequence were cloned into pGEX vector (GE Healthcare). Purified GST-mTOR fusion proteins were immobilized to glutathione-agarose for kinase assay. Kinase assays were performed following a previously described protocol (Upstate Biotechnology). Kinase activity was determined by incubating purified IKKα with GST-mTOR fragments, GST-IκB, or immunoprecipitates of mTOR and Raptor from HEK 293T cells as indicated in the presence of 1 μCi ml−1 [γ-32P]ATP or cold ATP (100 μm) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4–12%) and processed for autoradiography or protein immunoblotting. Purified GST-mTOR-(1351–1650) protein was incubated with recombinant IKKα for cold kinase assay, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue, excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry by Dr. John Asara of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The indicated transfected cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2.0 × 104 cells/well. Cells were trypsinized and counted using a hematocytometer every day until confluency. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega, Madison, WI). The cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 1.0 × 103 cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The number of cells at 1, 2, and 3 days was determined using a cell counter and the colorimetric CellTiter96 AQueous (MTS) assay (Promega). Results were depicted as absorbance at 490 nm as a function of time. The conditional IKKαloxp/loxp mice are described in Gareus et al. (42.Gareus R. Huth M. Breiden B. Nenci A. Rösch N. Haase I.

IKKαloxp/loxp/C+ males were bred to IKKαloxp/loxp females to obtain the IKKαloxp/loxp/C+ genotype. Male IKKαloxp/loxp/C+ mice between 6 and 15 weeks of age were used for experiments.

To address this issue, S6K, a known mTOR substrate, was expressed as an HA-tagged version with FLAG-tagged IKKα wild type or kinase-inactive forms. Results from this experiment revealed that expression of IKKα wild type, but not a kinase mutant, enhances S6K phosphorylation at Thr-389 (Fig. 1A). Similarly, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, another mTOR substrate, was enhanced with wild type IKKα expression but not with the kinase-dead variant (Fig. 1B). Next, we determined whether IKKα affects endogenous S6K phosphorylation and found that wild type IKKαsignificantly promoted, but kinase mutant IKKα inhibited, endogenous S6K phosphorylation in HEK 393T cells (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that IKKα activates mTOR in a kinase-dependent manner. To determine whether IKKα functions to promote mTOR activity through regulation of TSC2, it was determined whether IKKα affects the hyperactive mTORC1 signaling found in TSC2-null cells in which Rheb activates mTORC1 activity. It would be predicted that IKKα could not modulate mTORC1 activity in TSC2 null cells if IKKα regulates mTORC1 through TSC2. First, IKKα expression was silenced by siRNA-directed knockdown, and endogenous phosphorylation of S6K was analyzed. The data demonstrate that knockdown of IKKα significantly impaired mTORC1 activity in these cells (Fig. 1D). Moreover, expression of IKKα WT, but not kinase-inactive IKKα, promotes mTORC1 activity in both TSC2 wild type and TSC2-null cells (Fig. 1E). Collectively, the data indicate that IKKα activates mTORC1 in a kinase-dependent manner that is at least partly independent of TSC2. In addition, we tested the effects of wild type and kinase-inactive IKKα on insulin-induced mTORC1 activity. Endogenous IKKα was knocked down with siRNA (data not shown), and wild type and kinase-inactive FLAG-IKKα was transiently transfected into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1F, insulin induces mTORC1 activity in IKKα wild type, but not the mutant, transfected cells (Fig. 1F). These data indicate that IKK also regulates insulin-induced mTORC1 activity in a kinase-dependent manner. Previous studies demonstrated that IKKα interacts with mTORC1 downstream of active Akt (37.Dan H.C. Adli M. Baldwin A.S.

https://openalex.org/W2088229389,"Precise control of gene expression plays fundamental roles in brain development, but the roles of chromatin regulators in neuronal connectivity have remained poorly understood. We report that depletion of the NuRD complex by in vivo RNAi and conditional knockout of the core NuRD subunit Chd4 profoundly impairs the establishment of granule neuron parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses in the rodent cerebellar cortex in vivo. By interfacing genome-wide sequencing of transcripts and ChIP-seq analyses, we uncover a network of repressed genes and distinct histone modifications at target gene promoters that are developmentally regulated by the NuRD complex in the cerebellum in vivo. Finally, in a targeted in vivo RNAi screen of NuRD target genes, we identify a program of NuRD-repressed genes that operate as critical regulators of presynaptic differentiation in the cerebellar cortex. Our findings define NuRD-dependent promoter decommissioning as a developmentally regulated programming mechanism that drives synaptic connectivity in the mammalian brain."

Thus, our study reveals a layer of inhibitory control in feeding circuits that is required to suppress a latent state of unrestricted and nonselective consumption. Feeding behavior is critical for restoring metabolic homeostasis and is essential for survival. Animals have evolved sophisticated feedback mechanisms that monitor and rectify imbalances in energy stores by regulating food intake. Plasticity in food intake is achieved by altering feeding thresholds in response to internal needs and food availability (Dethier, 1976Dethier V.G. The Hungry Fly. Harvard University Press, Cambridge1976Google Scholar, Morton et al., 2006Morton G.J. Cummings D.E. Baskin D.G. Barsh G.S. Schwartz M.W.

How the nervous system coordinates internal physiological state with external sensory information to trigger feeding behaviors is insufficiently understood. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a promising model system to dissect the neural basis of feeding decisions. Many of the endocrine and neuropeptide systems that control feeding in mammals are conserved in Drosophila (Baker and Thummel, 2007Baker K.D. Thummel C.S.

Furthermore, the rapid development of genetic and physiological tools makes it an attractive organism to study molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying behavior (Venken et al., 2011Venken K.J.T.

The fly nervous system contains approximately 100,000 neurons, with many cells uniquely identifiable between animals, which significantly facilitates circuit analysis (Ito et al., 2013Ito M.

The numerical simplicity of this system enables cellular and synaptic examination of feeding regulation and may provide insight into mechanisms of regulation used throughout evolution. The detection of gustatory cues drives feeding initiation and ingestion in Drosophila. The neural circuits that process gustatory cues and elicit feeding behavior are just beginning to be elucidated. The fruit fly assesses the quality of potential food sources using gustatory neurons that detect sweet and bitter compounds and drive acceptance and rejection, respectively (Thorne et al., 2004Thorne N.

In addition, motor neurons controlling feeding subprograms for proboscis extension and ingestion have been described (Gordon and Scott, 2009Gordon M.D. Scott K.

Only one taste-responsive interneuron has been characterized to date: a putative feeding-command neuron that is activated by sugar and promotes feeding (Flood et al., 2013Flood T.F. Iguchi S.

The response to gustatory cues is highly regulated based on internal metabolic state. Significant progress has been made in identifying signaling mechanisms that communicate the physiological state to the nervous system. Circulating hormones from the neuroendocrine system and fat body, including Drosophila insulin-like peptides, adipokinetic hormone, and the leptin homolog Unpaired 2, signal the status of available carbohydrate and lipid stores (Rajan and Perrimon, 2013Rajan A. Perrimon N. Of flies and men: insights on organismal metabolism from fruit flies.BMC Biology. 2013; 11: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It was recently found that circulating fructose also reports the nutritional state and alters feeding behavior by direct activation of a few central neurons that express the fructose receptor Gr43a (Miyamoto et al., 2012Miyamoto T. Slone J. Song X. Amrein H. A fructose receptor functions as a nutrient sensor in the Drosophila brain.Cell. 2012; 151: 1113-1125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Furthermore, postingestive feedback from the gut likely inhibits feeding, as severing the recurrent nerve (RN) or the medial abdominal nerve (MAN), which transmit information from the gut to the brain, results in overconsumption in blowflies (Dethier and Gelperin, 1967Dethier V.G. Gelperin A. Hyperphagia in the blowfly.J. Exp. Biol. 1967; 47: 191-200Google Scholar). How the detection of peripheral signals of metabolic state is translated to alter feeding thresholds is largely unknown. Several central-effector pathways regulate feeding by promoting or inhibiting carbohydrate uptake. Neuropeptide Y, small neuropeptide F, and dopamine promote nutrient intake (Hergarden et al., 2012Hergarden A.C. Tayler T.D. Anderson D.J.

For example, leukokinin limits meal size, whereas drosulfakinin decreases consumption of nutrients. Although many molecular signaling pathways have been identified, the precise neuronal substrates mediating modulation and their effects on feeding circuits remain unclear. Moreover, the gating mechanisms for behavioral feeding subprograms as well as neural correlates for central feeding thresholds are unknown. Here, we identify four GABAergic interneurons that impart an inhibitory tone on ingestive behavior that is required for regulation by taste quality or satiety state. Inactivation of these neurons leads to robust and indiscriminate overconsumption regardless of the chemical properties of the ingested substance. We show that these neurons act upstream of motor neurons for multiple feeding subprograms. This study opens the door to analyzing how central inhibition regulates feeding behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster. To identify neurons that regulate consumption, we carried out a behavioral screen in which we inactivated neural subsets within the Drosophila central nervous system and monitored effects on water consumption time. Single flies were fed water until they became unresponsive to further stimulation, and total consumption time was monitored (Figure 1A). Water-satiated control flies consumed no water, whereas water-deprived controls increased intake in proportion to water deprivation time (Figure 1B). We performed a behavioral screen for flies that consumed water under water-replete conditions. An inwardly rectifying potassium channel that prevents depolarization, Kir2.1 (Baines et al., 2001Baines R.A. Uhler J.P. Thompson A. Sweeney S.T. Bate M. Altered electrical properties in Drosophila neurons developing without synaptic transmission.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was expressed in different neurons using a collection of Gal4 enhancer trap lines. A ubiquitous temperature-sensitive Gal80ts (McGuire et al., 2004McGuire S.E. Mao Z. Davis R.L. Spatiotemporal gene expression targeting with the TARGET and gene-switch systems in Drosophila.Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: pl6Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) was used to repress Kir2.1 expression until adulthood and then was inactivated by a 2-day temperature shift to 30°C, allowing Kir2.1 induction. Neurons in 363 Gal4 lines (Gohl et al., 2011Gohl D.M. Silies M.A. Gao X.J. Bhalerao S. Luongo F.J. Lin C.-C. Potter C.J. Clandinin T.R. A versatile in vivo system for directed dissection of gene expression patterns.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were conditionally inactivated upon Kir2.1 expression, and flies were monitored for water consumption time under water-replete conditions. The vast majority of Gal4 lines (349/363) drank water for less than 10 s. Strikingly, the screen yielded six transgenic lines that continued to consume water for more than a minute (Figure 1C) with assay termination at 2 min. The lack of water satiety in six Gal4 lines suggests that these lines mark neurons essential for consumption regulation. Five of the six Gal4 lines were broadly expressed in the brain and ventral nerve cord (VNC) (Figure S1 available online). One line, 98-Gal4, showed sparse expression and was further characterized. Wild-type (WT) water-deprived flies readily engaged in water consumption for a brief period, leading to meal termination and failure to initiate further consumption (Movie S1). In contrast, inactivation of 98-Gal4 neurons caused a complete absence of water satiety, resulting in extreme bloating and regurgitation. Nevertheless, the flies continued to initiate new meals (Movie S2). To examine whether the water overconsumption phenotype was similar to previously identified feeding phenotypes, we tested whether manipulation of identified neuropeptide/neurotransmitter systems altered water consumption (Al-Anzi et al., 2010Al-Anzi B.

Thus, the 98-Gal4 behavioral phenotype is distinct from other feeding phenotypes and is unlikely to result from altered activity of neuromodulatory systems previously associated with feeding regulation. The 98-Gal4 line labels 32 neurons in the brain, 6 neurons in the VNC, and approximately 10 peripheral neurons projecting to the abdominal ganglion (Figure 2A). We identified seven different morphological neural classes labeled by 98-Gal4 (Figure S2A).

Mosaic animals were tested for water consumption and categorized into two groups: animals in the “insatiable” cohort (n = 44) were behaviorally indistinguishable from 98-Gal4, UAS-TNT flies, whereas WT animals (n = 105) consumed water for less than 5 s. Cells causal for the overconsumption phenotype were identified based on two criteria: (1) they were labeled and consequently silenced in all the insatiable cohort brains, and (2) they were underrepresented in the WT cohort. Five of the seven cell types were silenced in less than half of the brains in either group with no significant overrepresentation in the insatiable cohort, demonstrating that they do not underlie the overconsumption phenotype (Figure 2B). Two populations of descending subesophageal neurons (DSOG) were always present in the insatiable group: DSOG1 (4 cells total) and DSOG2 cells (16 cells total) (Figure 2B). The frequency of DSOG1 cells was overrepresented in the insatiable cohort, whereas DSOG2 cells were labeled in all animals. In addition, the number of DSOG1 and DSOG2 cells labeled in the insatiable cohort was greater than in the control group (Figure 2C). Eight of 44 insatiable brains had only DSOG1 and DSOG2 cells silenced, arguing that DSOG1 or DSOG2 influences consumption. To further determine whether DSOG1 or DSOG2 cells were causal for the behavioral phenotype, we restricted expression to smaller subsets by screening for FLP enhancer trap lines (Bohm et al., 2010Bohm R.A. Welch W.P. Goodnight L.K. Cox L.W. Henry L.G. Gunter T.C. Bao H. Zhang B. A genetic mosaic approach for neural circuit mapping in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 16378-16383Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that excised tub > Gal80 > in 98-Gal4 subsets. This screen identified two informative FLP lines: 276B-FLP that restricted Gal4 activity to the four DSOG1 cells and 934-FLP that restricted activity to 10–12 DSOG2 cells (Figure 2E). Exclusively silencing DSOG1 cells resulted in insatiable behavior similar to silencing all 98-Gal4 neurons, with animals consuming water in nondeprived states (Figure 2D). Silencing DSOG2 cells did not cause overconsumption (Figure 2D). These studies demonstrate that inactivation of the four DSOG1 cells is sufficient to elicit overconsumption. Single-cell labeling of DSOG1 revealed the cell body in the ventral subesophageal zone (SEZ), with wide-field bilateral arborizations in the SEZ and VNC (Figure 2E; Movie S3). Labeling individual DSOG1 cells with a photoactivatable GFP (Ruta et al., 2010Ruta V. Datta S.R. Vasconcelos M.L. Freeland J. Looger L.L. Axel R. A dimorphic pheromone circuit in Drosophila from sensory input to descending output.Nature. 2010; 468: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) showed that all DSOG1 cells have a similar morphology (Figure S2B). Single-cell clones showed dendrites (labeled with DenMark) (Nicolaï et al., 2010Nicolaï L.J. Ramaekers A. Raemaekers T. Drozdzecki A. Mauss A.S. Yan J. Landgraf M. Annaert W. Hassan B.A. Genetically encoded dendritic marker sheds light on neuronal connectivity in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 20553-20558Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) in the SEZ and axons (labeled with synaptotagmin-GFP, SYT-GFP) (Zhang et al., 2002Zhang Y.Q. Rodesch C.K. Broadie K. Living synaptic vesicle marker: synaptotagmin-GFP.Genesis. 2002; 34: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) in the SEZ and VNC (Figure 2E). The SEZ contains axons from gustatory sensory neurons and dendrites of motor neurons that drive feeding (Stocker, 1994Stocker R.F. The organization of the chemosensory system in Drosophila melanogaster: a review.Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 275: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), suggesting that DSOG1 neurons are well positioned to modulate food intake. To examine whether DSOG1 cells selectively inhibit water consumption or generally regulate intake, we tested whether the overconsumption phenotype depended on category of the taste stimulus or satiety state. Unlike WT flies, which terminate feeding after a brief meal, flies with DSOG1 neurons expressing Kir2.1 exhibited insatiable ingestion culminating in regurgitation, at which time measurements were terminated (Figure 3A). They consumed appetitive compounds (sucrose and water) as well as aversive compounds (denatonium, 6 M sodium chloride [NaCl], 100% ethanol [EtOH]) for approximately 150 s, approximately 1 μl volume, in food-deprived and nondeprived conditions (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). In contrast, flies without Kir2.1 induction and controls did not consume under fed conditions, but consumed water and sucrose for approximately 17 s, 150 nl volume, after 24 hr deprivation and did not consume aversive compounds (Figures 3B and S3A). In addition, flies expressing Kir2.1 in DSOG1 neurons showed increased consumption on solid food (crystallized sucrose) (Figures S3B and S3C), arguing against a specific defect in liquid consumption. Rapid inactivation of DSOG1 neurons using a temperature-sensitive dominant-negative dynamin (UAS-shibirets) (Kitamoto, 2001Kitamoto T. Conditional modification of behavior in Drosophila by targeted expression of a temperature-sensitive shibire allele in defined neurons.J. Neurobiol. 2001; 47: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), which acts within minutes to inhibit neurotransmission, also led to overconsumption, showing that output from DSOG1 cells is acutely required to mediate meal rejection (Figure 3C). As inactivation of DSOG1 neurons promoted consumption, we tested whether inducing activity in these cells would inhibit feeding. The temperature-sensitive cation channel dTRPA1 was expressed in DSOG1 cells, and flies were monitored for water and sucrose consumption at temperatures at which dTRPA1 was not active (22°C) or was active (30°C). dTRPA1-induced activation of DSOG1 cells reduced sucrose consumption by one-third and water consumption by half as compared to controls in food- and food-and-water-deprived flies, respectively (Figures 3D and S3D), demonstrating that acute activation of DSOG1 neurons directly inhibits consumption. Feeding in Drosophila comprises a number of steps including foraging to identify food at a distance, proboscis extension to allow feeding initiation, and ingestion. We tested whether inactivating DSOG1 neurons in flies altered the thresholds for all aspects of feeding behavior, by examining effects on starvation-induced locomotion and proboscis extension. The activity of single flies was monitored for 60 hr under fed and deprived conditions. Flies expressing the potassium channel Kir2.1 in DSOG1 neurons showed normal increased locomotion under food-deprived conditions (Figures 4A and 4 B) and normal locomotor behavior (Figure S3E), demonstrating that DSOG1 is not required for starvation-induced foraging. In contrast, flies lacking DSOG1 activity showed increased proboscis extension to nutrients and bitter compounds in fed and deprived states as well as increased extension to water in nondeprived states (Figures 4C–4F). These experiments argue that DSOG1 activity is required for rejection of aversive substances and rejection of appetitive substances upon satiation, affecting both feeding initiation and consumption. In the absence of DSOG1 activity, flies consume substances that are normally rejected, as well as compounds that are rejected in sated conditions, suggesting that DSOG1 acts downstream of bitter cues and satiety signals to inhibit consumption. To test whether the activity of DSOG1 neurons is altered by gustatory detection or satiety state, we performed cell-attached recordings of DSOG1 in live flies (Marella et al., 2012Marella S. Mann K. Scott K. Dopaminergic modulation of sucrose acceptance behavior in Drosophila.Neuron. 2012; 73: 941-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). DSOG1 neurons showed an average baseline firing rate of ∼17 Hz, with a standard deviation of 6Hz. DSOG1 neurons did not respond to gustatory stimulation with 1 M sucrose, 1 mM denatonium, or water in fed states (Figures 5A and 5B ) or in deprived states (Figure S4A). The baseline activity of DSOG1 neurons was not significantly different in flies that were water deprived, food deprived, or nondeprived (Figure 5C). We also monitored the steady-state activity of DSOG1 neurons in flies with overdistended or nondistended abdomens. 98-Gal4, UAS-TNT flies were fed water until bloated, and activity in DSOG1 cells was monitored. TNT was used to block activity as it selectively inhibits synaptic vesicle release without altering action potential firing. The steady-state activity of DSOG1 neurons in 98-Gal4, UAS-TNT flies with nondistended or overdistended abdomens was also not significantly different (Figure 5C), arguing that gut distention does not activate DSOG1 neurons. We performed additional tests to examine activation of DSOG1 cells by sensory stimuli. Using a dissected brain plus VNC preparation, we electrically stimulated (10 V) the major nerves of the VNC and brain that contain gustatory and mechanosenory inputs and monitored responses of DSOG1 by GCaMP calcium imaging (Mann et al., 2013Mann K.

This study aimed to assess the association of the phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and soluble Klotho with all-cause mortality. We measured soluble Klotho and FGF23 levels at enrolment and two weeks later in 239 prevalent hemodialysis patients. The primary hypothesis was that low Klotho and high FGF23 are associated with increased mortality. The association between Klotho and atrial fibrillation (AF) at baseline was explored as secondary outcome. AF was defined as presence of paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AF. During a median follow-up of 924 days, 59 (25%) patients died from any cause. Lower Klotho levels were not associated with mortality in a multivariable adjusted analysis when examined either on a continuous scale (HR 1.25 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.84–1.86) or in tertiles, with tertile 1 as the reference category (HR for tertile two 0.65, 95% CI 0.26–1.64; HR for tertile three 2.18, 95% CI 0.91–2.23). Higher Klotho levels were associated with the absence of AF in a muItivariable logistic regression analysis (OR 0.66 per SD increase, 95% CI 0.41–1.00). Higher FGF23 levels were associated with mortality risk in a multivariable adjusted analysis when examined either on a continuous scale (HR 1.45 per SD increase, 95% CI 1.05–1.99) or in tertiles, with the tertile 1 as the reference category (HR for tertile two 1.63, 95% CI 0.64–4.14; HR for tertile three 3.91, 95% CI 1.28–12.20). FGF23 but not Klotho levels are associated with mortality in hemodialysis patients. Klotho may be protective against AF."

Sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia require Wnt signaling for initial cell-fate determination as well as patterning and synapse formation. Here we report that Wnt signaling pathways persist in adult sensory neurons and play a functional role in their sensitization in a pathophysiological context. We observed that Wnt3a recruits the Wnt-calcium signaling pathway and the Wnt planar cell polarity pathway in peripheral nerves to alter pain sensitivity in a modality-specific manner and we elucidated underlying mechanisms. In contrast, biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic studies revealed lack of functional relevance for the classical canonical β-catenin pathway in peripheral sensory neurons in acute modulation of nociception. Finally, this study provides proof-of-concept for a translational potential for Wnt3a-Frizzled3 signaling in alleviating disease-related pain hypersensitivity in cancer-associated pain in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1971197707,"Silybin, is one imminent therapeutic for drug induced hepatotoxicity, human prostate adenocarcinoma and other degenerative organ diseases. Recent evidences suggest that silybin influences gluconeogenesis pathways favorably and is beneficial in the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The compound however is constrained due to solubility (0.4 mg/mL) and bioavailabilty limitations. Appropriate nanoparticle design for silybin in biocompatible polymers was thus proposed as a probable solution for therapeutic inadequacy. New surface engineered biopolymeric nanoparticles with high silybin encapsulation efficiency of 92.11% and zeta potential of +21 mV were designed. Both the pure compound and the nanoparticles were evaluated in vivo for the first time in experimental diabetic conditions. Animal health recovered substantially and the blood glucose levels came down to near normal values after 28 days treatment schedule with the engineered nanoparticles. Restoration from hyperglycemic damage condition was traced to serum insulin regeneration. Serum insulin recovered from the streptozotocin induced pancreatic damage levels of 0.17 ± 0.01 µg/lit to 0.57 ± 0.11 µg/lit after nanoparticle treatment. Significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin level, and restoration of liver glycogen content were some of the other interesting observations. Engineered silybin nanoparticle assisted recovery in diabetic conditions was reasoned due to improved silybin dissolution, passive transport in nanoscale, and restoration of antioxidant status."

Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) is a β-hemolytic, encapsulated Gram-positive microorganism that colonizes the anogenital tract of 25–30% of healthy women. It is a major cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis, particularly in infants born to mothers carrying the bacteria (1.Schuchat A. Epidemiology of group B streptococcal disease in the United States: shifting paradigms.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 497-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pathogen can also infect adults with underlying disease, particularly the elderly, and cause bovine mastitis. The GBS 2The abbreviations used are: GBSGroup B StreptococcusGlcpglucoseCPScapsular polysaccharideGalpgalactoseGlcpNAcN-acetylglucosamineGlcpNglucosamineNeupNAcN-acetylneuraminic acidMALM. amurensis lectin. capsule is a major virulence factor enabling the bacterium to evade human innate immune defenses (2.Rubens C.E.

It is constituted by high molecular weight polysaccharides of which 10 variants exist (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX) differing in chemical composition. As for other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, individual polysaccharide repeating units are assembled on a carrier lipid (undecaprenyl phosphate) by the sequential activities of glycosyltransferase enzymes. Repeat units are transferred across the plasma membrane by a “flippase” protein. Polymerization occurs at the periplasmic face of the plasma membrane and is catalyzed by a polymerase enzyme. Group B Streptococcus glucose capsular polysaccharide galactose N-acetylglucosamine glucosamine N-acetylneuraminic acid M. amurensis lectin. All the genes responsible for the synthesis and cell wall attachment of the GBS capsular polysaccharides (CPS) are clustered in the cps operon. This operon is composed of 16–18 genes, the sequences of which differ among serotypes (4.Cieslewicz M.J. Kasper D.L. Wang Y. Wessels M.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 139-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). High titers of maternal antibodies to each CPS variant correlate with serotype-specific reduction of disease risk in the newborn (5.Baker C.J. Kasper D.L. Correlation of maternal antibody deficiency with susceptibility to neonatal group B streptococcal infection.N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 294: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Hence, maternal vaccination with CPS conjugates shows great promise for the prevention of GBS neonatal disease (6.Edwards M.S. Group B streptococcal conjugate vaccine. A timely concept for which the time has come.Hum. Vaccin. 2008; 4: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The most common serotypes among GBS infective isolates are Ia, Ib, II, III, and V, although there are some geographical and historical variations (7.Le Doare K. Heath P.T. An overview of global GBS epidemiology.Vaccine. 2013; 31: D7-D12Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). For instance, the frequency of type V has increased in the last few years, whereas serotype IV has recently emerged as a cause of adult and neonatal invasive disease (8.Ferrieri P. Lynfield R. Creti R. Flores A.E. Serotype IV and invasive group B Streptococcus disease in neonates, Minnesota, U.S.A., 2000–2010.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2013; 19: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, accurately monitoring the variation of this important target antigen is essential for predicting vaccine coverage. The serotype IX was identified only in 2007 during the analysis of three human isolates that failed to react with antisera against the nine GBS types described at that time. Preparation of specific antisera allowed the identification of additional type IX strains among formerly non-typeable isolates (9.Slotved H.C. Kong F. Lambertsen L. Sauer S. Gilbert G.L. Serotype IX, a proposed new Streptococcus agalactiae serotype.J. Clin. Microbiol. 2007; 45: 2929-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The identity of GBS type IX was also confirmed by a multiplex PCR assay containing a mix of primers specific for the 10 different allelic variants of the cps genes (10.Imperi M. Pataracchia M.

They are composed of repeating units of four to seven monosaccharides with a backbone and one or two side chains. Four monosaccharides (i.e. Glcp, Galp, GlcpNAc, and NeupNAc) are present in all nine described serotypes, and the NeupNAc residue is always found at the terminus of one of their side chains. However, the pattern of glycosidic linkages is unique to each serotype. Structural comparison of the nine GBS polysaccharide variants and alignment of their cps gene sequences indicated that their differential evolution proceeded through en bloc replacement of individual glycosyltransferase genes with DNA sequences encoding enzymes with new linkage specificities (22.Cieslewicz M.J.

GBS type IX strains IT-NI-016 (isolated from a neonatal early onset disease case), IT-PW-62, and IT-PW-64 (from colonized pregnant women) were kindly provided by Alberto Berardi (Policlinico di Modena, Italy), Roberta Creti, Lucilla Baldassarri, and Graziella Orefici (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy). The three strains as well as CZ-PW-119 (VI), CZ-PW-045 (VII), and CZ-NI-016 (serotype IV) were isolated and typed by latex and molecular approaches in the frame of the DEVANI study (10.Imperi M.

Strains 2603 V/R (serotype V), COH1 (serotype III), 18RS21 (serotype II), and JM9130013 (serotype VIII) were obtained from Dennis Kasper (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Strains 515 (serotype Ia) and H36B (serotype Ib) were obtained from Carol Baker (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The GBS strain IT-NI-016 was used for preparation of CPS IX from 1 liter of bacterial culture grown to exponential phase in Todd Hewitt broth. The purification process was based on previously described procedures (24.Wessels M.R. Paoletti L.C. Kasper D.L. DiFabio J.L. Michon F. Holme K. Jennings H.J. Immunogenicity in animals of a polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine against type III group B Streptococcus.J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 86: 1428-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bacterial pellet was recovered by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 20 min and incubated with 0.8 n NaOH at 37 °C for 36 h. After centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 20 min, 1 m Tris buffer (1:9, v/v) was added to the supernatant and diluted with 1:1 (v/v) HCl to reach a neutral pH. To further purify type IX CPS, 2 m CaCl2 (0.1 m final concentration) and ethanol (30% (v/v) final concentration) were added to the solution. After centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was subjected to tangential flow filtration with a 10,000-molecular weight cutoff (Hydrosart Sartorius; 0.1-m2 surface) against 14 volumes of 50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.8 and 7 volumes of 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2. To reconstitute full N-acetylation of possibly present GlcpNAc and NeupNAc residues, 1:5 (v/v) of 400 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.4 (final concentration, 80 mm) was added. The material was stored at room temperature for 15 min and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 20 min to remove any minor particles. The supernatant was subjected to filtration with a 10,000-molecular weight cutoff (Vivaspin Sartorius; 20-ml device) against 300 mm Na2CO3, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.8. A 1:1 diluted solution of 4.15 μl/ml acetic anhydride in ethanol was added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The sample was subjected to filtration with a 10,000-molecular weight cutoff (Vivaspin Sartorius; 20-ml device) against Milli-Q water, CaCl2 (0.1 m final concentration) and ethanol (30% (v/v) final concentration) were added, and the sample was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 20 min. The purified CPS IX was finally recovered by precipitation with ethanol (80%, v/v), and the pellet was dried under vacuum (SpeedVac, Thermo). The purity of the polysaccharide preparation was assessed by colorimetric assays, which indicated a content of residual proteins and nucleic acids below 1% (w/w). Endotoxin content measured by Limulus amebocyte lysate was <10 endotoxin units/μg of saccharide. Highly purified GBS type Ia, Ib, II, III, V, and VII CPSs were obtained by applying the same purification process as described above for type IX. The monosaccharides constituting the GBS type IX repeating unit were obtained by acidic hydrolysis. Two different series of standard samples with five increasing concentrations, the first containing Glcp, Galp, and GlcpNAc (Sigma) ranging between 0.2 and 4.0 μg/ml (as saccharide powder/ml) and the second containing NeupNAc (Sigma) between 1.0 and 10.0 μg/ml (as saccharide powder/ml), were prepared for building individual calibration curves for each monosaccharide. Two CPS IX samples targeting final concentrations in the calibration curve range were prepared. All the reference and analytical samples for Glcp/Galp/GlcpNAc were prepared in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma), incubated at 100 °C for 2 h, dried under vacuum (SpeedVac Thermo), and suspended in water. Reference and analytical samples for NeupNAc were prepared in 0.05 m HCl (Merck), incubated at 75 °C for 1 h, and neutralized by addition of NaOH. All analytical samples were filtered with 0.45-μm Acrodisc (Pall) filters before analysis. High performance anionic exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection analysis was performed with a Dionex ICS3000 equipped with a CarboPac PA1 column (4 × 250 mm; Dionex) coupled with a PA1 guard column (4 × 50 mm; Dionex). Samples (20-μl injection volume) were run at 1 ml/min using an isocratic elution with either 24 mm NaOH (Carlo Erba) followed by a washing step with 0.5 m NaOH or 30 mm sodium acetate (Sigma) in 100 mm NaOH followed by a washing step with NaNO3 (gradient from 50 to 200 mm) in 100 mm NaOH. The effluent was monitored using an electrochemical detector in the pulse amperometric mode with a gold working electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. A quadruple potential waveform for carbohydrates was applied. The resulting chromatographic data were processed using Chromeleon software 6.8 (Dionex). The configurations of the monosaccharides were determined by methylation according to the procedure of Ciucanu and Kerek (25.Ciucanu I. Kerek F. A simple and rapid method for the permethylation of carbohydrates.Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3190) Google Scholar) followed by hydrolysis, reduction, acetylation, and GC analysis. A 1-mg solution of polysaccharide sample in 95:5 DMSO/water (0.3–0.5 ml) was added to 3–5 mg of finely powdered NaOH, and after 10 min of incubation at room temperature, 0.1 ml of methyl iodide was added. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. Water (2 ml) and dichloromethane (10 ml) were then added, and the organic layer was washed with water (2 ml for three times) and then dried with Na2SO4. The dried sample was then hydrolyzed by the addition of 0.8 ml of 4 m trifluoroacetic acid and incubation at 100 °C for 2 h with stirring. After complete evaporation under vacuum (Thermo SpeedVac at 45 °C for 4 h), the dried sample was reduced with 1 m aqueous sodium borohydride (0.4 ml) and stirred for 5 h at room temperature. The sample was then acetylated with a mixture of pyridine (2 ml) and acetic anhydride (1 ml), and the reaction was stirred overnight. The excess reagent was removed by evaporation, and alditol acetates were extracted with a dichloromethane/water mixture. The generated monosaccharides were analyzed by capillary gas-liquid chromatography using a Thermo Scientific Trace GC Ultra/TSQ Quantum XLS equipped with a Restek Rxi-17Sil MS column (30 m, 0.25-mm inner diameter, 0.25 μm) in the isothermal program at 190 °C for 80 min. 1H and 13C NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 400- or 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with a high precision temperature controller using a 5-mm broadband probe (Bruker). TopSpin version 2.6 software (Bruker) was used for data acquisition and processing. 1H NMR spectra were collected at 25 or 35 ± 0.1 °C with 32,000 data points over a 10-ppm spectral width, accumulating 128 scans. The spectra were weighted with 0.2-Hz line broadening and Fourier-transformed. The transmitter was set at the water frequency, which was used as the reference signal (4.79 ppm). 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 100.6 or 125.7 MHz and 25 ± 0.1 °C with 32,000 data points over a 200-ppm spectral width, accumulating 4,000 scans. The spectra were weighted with 0.2-Hz line broadening and Fourier-transformed. The transmitter was set at the ethanol frequency, which was used as the reference signal (17.47 ppm). All monodimensional proton NMR spectra were obtained in a quantitative manner using a total recycle time to ensure full recovery of each signal (5 × longitudinal relaxation time T1). Bidimensional 1H-1H homo- and 1H-13C heterocorrelated experiments (correlation spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy, NOESY, heteronuclear single quantum correlation, heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation, and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation) were acquired with standard pulse programs. Typically, 2,048 and 256 data points were collected in F2 and F1 dimensions, respectively, and 128 scans were accumulated prior to Fourier transformation to yield a digital resolution of 0.2 and 3.0 Hz per point in F2 and F1, respectively. Selective 1H monodimensional total correlation spectroscopy and NOESY experiments were collected at 35 ± 0.1 °C with 32,000 data points over a 10-ppm spectral width, accumulating 1,024 scans. A Gaussian shape was used for selective excitation. For NOESY, a mixing time of 300 ms was used. The spectra were weighted with 0.2-Hz line broadening and Fourier-transformed. The NMR analytical samples of type Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX CPSs were prepared by solubilizing ∼0.5–2 mg of dried saccharide in 0.75 ml of deuterium oxide (99.9 atom % deuterium; Aldrich). The solutions were mixed to obtain a uniform concentration and subsequently transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube (Wilmad). The average molecular weight of CPS IX was estimated by an Ultimate 3000 system (Dionex) on PolySep GFC-P 6000 and PolySep GFC-P 5000 analytical columns with a GFC-Guard column (Phenomenex) connected in series and calibrated with a series of defined pullulan standards (Polymer) of average molecular weights ranging from 20,000 to 800,000. The void and total volumes were determined with dextran and sodium azide, respectively. The polysaccharide samples were analyzed at a concentration of 1 mg/ml using 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Polyclonal rabbit sera were obtained from the Statens Serum Institute (Copenhagen, Denmark). CPS type IX-specific mouse antiserum was obtained by immunizing CD1 mice with purified CRM197-CPS type IX conjugate prepared as described previously (25.Ciucanu I. Kerek F. A simple and rapid method for the permethylation of carbohydrates.Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3190) Google Scholar). Animal treatments were performed in compliance with the Italian laws and approved by the institutional review board (Animal Ethics Committee) of Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Siena, Italy. GBS serotyping by latex agglutination assay was conducted using the Strep-B-Latex kit (Statens Serum Institute) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For flow cytometry analysis using lectins, bacteria were grown overnight on tryptic soy agar plates at 37 °C, harvested using a sterile loop, and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to an A600 of 0.3. The bacterial suspension (400 μl) was centrifuged at 3,000 × g, suspended in 200 μl of PBS containing 1% BSA, and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with shaking (blocking). Bacteria were then diluted 1:10 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBSAT), and 5 μg/ml biotinylated Maackia amurensis lectin (MAL) I (Vector Laboratories) specific for NeupNAc-α-(2→3)-Galp-β-(1→4)-GlcpNAc-β-(1→trisaccharide). The solution was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were washed twice in PBSAT, suspended in phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Southern Biotech) diluted 1:200 in PBSAT, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Bacteria were washed twice in PBS, fixed in PBS containing 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, centrifuged, and suspended in 150 μl of PBS. Flow cytometry using specific anti-capsular polysaccharide antibodies was performed as described elsewhere (26.Maione D. Margarit I. Rinaudo C.D. Masignani V. Mora M. Scarselli M. Tettelin H.

Kasper D.L. Telford J.L. Grandi G. Identification of a universal Group B streptococcus vaccine by multiple genome screen.Science. 2005; 309: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) with minor differences. Briefly, bacteria grown in Todd Hewitt broth to exponential phase were harvested and fixed in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with immune mouse sera raised against type V or type IX purified polysaccharides diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 23 °C with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab)2 goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. All data were collected using a FACSCalibur and a BD FACS CANTO II (BD Biosciences) by acquiring 10,000 events, and data analysis was performed with FlowJo software (v.8.6, TreeStar Inc.). For high throughput full genome deep sequencing of type IX strains IX IT-NI-016, IT-PW-62, and IT-PW-64, 5 μg of genomic DNA was randomly sheared by a Covaris S2 instrument with set target size of 300 bp. DNA libraries were automatically generated by mixing 2.5 μg of sheared DNA with 2.5 μl of indexed Illumina adapter from TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation kits (Illumina). SPRIworks Fragment Library kit I cartridges (Beckman Coulter) and size selection of 300–600 bp were used for library preparation. Library enrichment was performed using a TruSeq Sample Preparation kit (Illumina), and amplified products were purified by Ampure XP Magnetic Beads (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Adapted libraries were quantified for optimal cluster density with the 7900 HT Fast RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) using the KAPA SYBR FAST ABI Prism qPCR kit (Kapa Biosystems). Libraries were then pooled, denatured, diluted to a final concentration of 6 pm, and loaded on the cBOTTM System (Illumina) for the cluster generation step. Sequencing was performed on a HiSeq2000 in a 100-bp paired-end run using TruSeq SBS chemistry (Illumina). For alignment comparisons, nucleotide sequences of the cps serotype-specific regions from reference GBS strains were retrieved from the NCBI database (type V reference strain 2603V/R, accession number NC_004116; type VII reference, accession number AY376403). Multiple and pairwise sequence alignments were performed with MUSCLE using Geneious version 7.05 (Biomatters). Two different plasmids were designed to obtain the chimeric CPS-expressing strains. First, DNA fragments consisting of the cps type V-specific (cps5M, cps5O, and cps5I) or the type IX-specific genes (cps9M and cps9I) were amplified by PCR from S. agalactiae CJB111 or from IT-NI-016 genomic DNA, respectively, using specifically designed primers (Table 1) and the following reaction cycle: 1 min at 98 °C; 10 s at 98 °C, 20 s at 55 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C (30 cycles); and 7 min at 72 °C. Then the resulting fragments were alternatively cloned into the expression vector pAM-p80 (26.Maione D. Margarit I. Rinaudo C.D. Masignani V. Mora M. Scarselli M. Tettelin H. Brettoni C.

Plasmids were purified and used to transform GBS by electroporation. Strain IT-NI-016 (serotype IX) was transformed with pAM-cps5MOI, and pAM-cps9MI was used to transform strain 2603 V/R. Both plasmids were also used to transform serotype VII strain CZ-PW-045.TABLE 1List of oligonucleotides used for plasmid constructionPrimer nameSequence (5′ → 3′)LengthbppAM-IXMI-FGCGGCGCGGCCGCGACATATTTGCTCTGATATGGCAG37pAM-IXMI-RGCGGCAGATCTGGGATAATGATACTAATCATCTTC35pAM-VMOI-FGCGGCGCGGCCGCGCTCTGATATGGCAGGAGGTAAGG37pAM-VMOI-RGCGGCAGATCTGGGATAATGATACTAACTTTATCC35 Open table in a new tab In a first attempt to investigate the chemical structure of the type IX capsular polysaccharide, we performed flow cytometry on different GBS strains representing the 10 serotypes. Bacteria were labeled with biotinylated MAL I specific for NeupNAc-α-(2→3)-Galp-β-(1→4)-GlcpNAc-β-(1→. As expected, MAL I reacted with serotype Ia, III, IV, V, and VII bacteria that contain the trisaccharide in their side chain but not with types Ib, II, VI, and VIII (Fig. 1). The type IX strain IT-NI-016 was clearly labeled by the lectin, indicating that this trisaccharide is also present on the surface of type IX bacteria. Type IX CPS was then isolated by alkaline treatment of GBS IT-NI-016 and highly purified following the procedures described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified material was spotted onto nitrocellulose and showed good reactivity with a commercial rabbit type IX antiserum in dot blot analysis (data not shown). The CPS IX preparation was structurally characterized by evaluating its molecular size, monosaccharide composition, and structural identity. The average molecular weight estimated by size exclusion chromatography-HPLC was ∼100,000. High performance anionic exchange chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection compositional analysis revealed Glc, Gal, GlcNAc, and NeuNAc in a molar ratio of 1.0:1.9:2.0:1.3. The data indicated that CPS IX is composed of the same monosaccharide residues as Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, V, and VII, although, differently from the other CPS types, it contains 2 mol of GlcNAc per repeating unit. To preliminarily assess the configuration of the monosaccharides composing a type IX repeating unit, a sugar linkage-type analysis was performed by GC-MS. Several variably linked monosaccharide units were revealed, including 3-monosubstituted Galp ((→3)-Galp-(1→)) and 4-monosubstituted Galp ((→4)-Galp-(1→)), Glcp ((→4)-Glcp-(1→)), and GlcpNAc ((→4)-GlcpNAc-(1→)). Further structural evaluation was achieved by comparing the 1H monodimensional NMR spectrum of CPS IX with those of other CPS types for which peak assignments have already been reported (13.Jennings H.J.

https://openalex.org/W2090313174,"The stiffness of fracture fixation devices together with musculoskeletal loading defines the mechanical environment within a long bone fracture, and can be quantified by the interfragmentary movement. In vivo results suggested that this can have acceleratory or inhibitory influences, depending on direction and magnitude of motion, indicating that some complications in fracture treatment could be avoided by optimizing the fixation stiffness. However, general statements are difficult to make due to the limited number of experimental findings. The aim of this study was therefore to numerically investigate healing outcomes under various combinations of shear and axial fixation stiffness, and to detect the optimal configuration. A calibrated and established numerical model was used to predict fracture healing for numerous combinations of axial and shear fixation stiffness under physiological, superimposed, axial compressive and translational shear loading in sheep. Characteristic maps of healing outcome versus fixation stiffness (axial and shear) were created. The results suggest that delayed healing of 3 mm transversal fracture gaps will occur for highly flexible or very rigid axial fixation, which was corroborated by in vivo findings. The optimal fixation stiffness for ovine long bone fractures was predicted to be 1000–2500 N/mm in the axial and >300 N/mm in the shear direction. In summary, an optimized, moderate axial stiffness together with certain shear stiffness enhances fracture healing processes. The negative influence of one improper stiffness can be compensated by adjustment of the stiffness in the other direction."
https://openalex.org/W2048019126,"This study describes the species diversity of fishes of the Narmada River in India. A total of 820 fish specimens were collected from 17 sampling locations across the whole river basin. Fish were taxonomically classified into one of 90 possible species based on morphological characters, and then DNA barcoding was employed using COI gene sequences as a supplemental identification method. A total of 314 different COI sequences were generated, and specimens were confirmed to belong to 85 species representing 63 genera, 34 families and 10 orders. Findings of this study include the identification of five putative cryptic or sibling species and 43 species not previously known from the Narmada River basin. Five species are endemic to India and three are introduced species that had not been previously reported to occur in the Narmada River. Conversely, 43 species previously reported to occur in the Narmada were not found. Genetic diversity and distance values were generated for all of the species within genera, families and orders using Kimura’s 2 parameter distance model followed by the construction of a Neighbor Joining tree. High resolution clusters generated in NJ trees aided the groupings of species corresponding to their genera and families which are in confirmation to the values generated by Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery bioinformatics platform. This aided to decide a threshold value for the discrimination of species boundary from the Narmada River. This study provides an important validation of the use of DNA barcode sequences for monitoring species diversity and changes within complex ecosystems such as the Narmada River."
https://openalex.org/W1979259332,"Inflammation and inflammatory mediators are inextricably linked with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through complex pathways in the tumor microenvironment. However, the mechanism by which inflammatory mediators, such as the lipid inflammatory mediators, eicosanoids, contribute to EMT is largely unknown. In the present study we observed that BLT2, leukotriene B4 receptor-2, is markedly up-regulated by oncogenic Ras and promotes EMT in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in mammary epithelial cells. Blockade of BLT2 by the BLT2 inhibitor LY255283 or by siRNA reduced EMT induced by Ras in the presence of TGF-β. In addition, stimulation of BLT2 by the addition of a BLT2 ligand, such as leukotriene B4, restored EMT in the presence of TGF-β in human immortalized mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells. We further searched BLT2 downstream components and identified reactive oxygen species and nuclear factor κB as critical components that contribute to EMT. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that a BLT2-linked inflammatory pathway contributes to EMT. This provides valuable insight into the mechanism of EMT in mammary epithelial cells. In addition, considering the implications of EMT with the stemness of cancer cells, our finding may contribute to a better understanding of tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W1982780332,"Salvianolic acid B (SalB), a bioactive compound isolated from the plant-derived medicinal herb Danshen, has been shown to exert various anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities in several neurological disorders. In this study, we sought to investigate the potential protective effects and associated molecular mechanisms of SalB in Parkinson’s disease (PD) models. To determine the neuroprotective effects of SalB in vitro, MPP+- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuronal injury was achieved using primary cultures with different compositions of neurons, microglia and astrocytes. Our results showed that SalB reduced both LPS- and MPP+-induced toxicity of dopamine neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, SalB treatment inhibited the release of microglial pro-inflammatory cytokines and resulted in an increase in the expression and release of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) from astrocytes. Western blot analysis illustrated that SalB increased the expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). The knockdown of Nrf2 using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) partially reversed the SalB-induced GDNF expression and anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, SalB treatment significantly attenuated dopaminergic (DA) neuronal loss, inhibited neuroinflammation, increased GDNF expression and improved the neurological function in MPTP-treated mice. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that SalB protects DA neurons by an Nrf-2 -mediated dual action: reducing microglia activation-mediated neuroinflammation and inducing astrocyte activation-dependent GDNF expression. Importantly the present study also highlights critical roles of glial cells as targets for developing new strategies to alter the progression of neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2092850906,"DHX9 is an ATP-dependent DEXH box helicase with a multitude of cellular functions. Its ability to unwind both DNA and RNA, as well as aberrant, noncanonical polynucleotide structures, has implicated it in transcriptional and translational regulation, DNA replication and repair, and maintenance of genome stability. We report that loss of DHX9 in primary human fibroblasts results in premature senescence, a state of irreversible growth arrest. This is accompanied by morphological defects, elevation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase levels, and changes in gene expression closely resembling those encountered during replicative (telomere-dependent) senescence. Activation of the p53 signaling pathway was found to be essential to this process. ChIP analysis and investigation of nascent DNA levels revealed that DHX9 is associated with origins of replication and that its suppression leads to a reduction of DNA replication. Our results demonstrate an essential role of DHX9 in DNA replication and normal cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W1974310636,"Climatic warming has direct implications for fire-dominated disturbance patterns in northern ecosystems. A transforming wildfire regime is altering plant composition and successional patterns, thus affecting the distribution and potentially the abundance of large herbivores. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) are an important subsistence resource for communities throughout the north and a species that depends on terrestrial lichen in late-successional forests and tundra systems. Projected increases in area burned and reductions in stand ages may reduce lichen availability within caribou winter ranges. Sufficient reductions in lichen abundance could alter the capacity of these areas to support caribou populations. To assess the potential role of a changing fire regime on winter habitat for caribou, we used a simulation modeling platform, two global circulation models (GCMs), and a moderate emissions scenario to project annual fire characteristics and the resulting abundance of lichen-producing vegetation types (i.e., spruce forests and tundra >60 years old) across a modeling domain that encompassed the winter ranges of the Central Arctic and Porcupine caribou herds in the Alaskan-Yukon Arctic. Fires were less numerous and smaller in tundra compared to spruce habitats throughout the 90-year projection for both GCMs. Given the more likely climate trajectory, we projected that the Porcupine caribou herd, which winters primarily in the boreal forest, could be expected to experience a greater reduction in lichen-producing winter habitats (−21%) than the Central Arctic herd that wintered primarily in the arctic tundra (−11%). Our results suggest that caribou herds wintering in boreal forest will undergo fire-driven reductions in lichen-producing habitats that will, at a minimum, alter their distribution. Range shifts of caribou resulting from fire-driven changes to winter habitat may diminish access to caribou for rural communities that reside in fire-prone areas."
https://openalex.org/W2049205589,"Protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum is assisted by molecular chaperones and folding catalysts that include members of the protein-disulfide isomerase and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase families. In this report, we examined the contributions of the cyclophilin subset of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases to protein folding and identified cyclophilin C as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cyclophilin in addition to cyclophilin B. Using albumin and transferrin as models of cis-proline-containing proteins in human hepatoma cells, we found that combined knockdown of cyclophilins B and C delayed transferrin secretion but surprisingly resulted in more efficient oxidative folding and secretion of albumin. Examination of the oxidation status of ER protein-disulfide isomerase family members revealed a shift to a more oxidized state. This was accompanied by a >5-fold elevation in the ratio of oxidized to total glutathione. This ""hyperoxidation"" phenotype could be duplicated by incubating cells with the cyclophilin inhibitor cyclosporine A, a treatment that triggered efficient ER depletion of cyclophilins B and C by inducing their secretion to the medium. To identify the pathway responsible for ER hyperoxidation, we individually depleted several enzymes that are known or suspected to deliver oxidizing equivalents to the ER: Ero1αβ, VKOR, PRDX4, or QSOX1. Remarkably, none of these enzymes contributed to the elevated oxidized to total glutathione ratio induced by cyclosporine A treatment. These findings establish cyclophilin C as an ER cyclophilin, demonstrate the novel involvement of cyclophilins B and C in ER redox homeostasis, and suggest the existence of an additional ER oxidative pathway that is modulated by ER cyclophilins."
https://openalex.org/W2058289429,"Study Objectives We investigated the association of HIV infection and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with sleep disordered breathing (SDB), fatigue, and sleepiness. Methods HIV-uninfected men (HIV−; n = 60), HIV-infected men using HAART (HIV+/HAART+; n = 58), and HIV-infected men not using HAART (HIV+/HAART−; n = 41) recruited from two sites of the Multicenter AIDS cohort study (MACS) underwent a nocturnal sleep study, anthropometric assessment, and questionnaires for fatigue and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The prevalence of SDB in HIV- men was compared to that in men matched from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). Results The prevalence of SDB was unexpectedly high in all groups: 86.7% for HIV−, 70.7% for HIV+/HAART+, and 73.2% for HIV+/HAART−, despite lower body-mass indices (BMI) in HIV+ groups. The higher prevalence in the HIV− men was significant in univariate analyses but not after adjustment for BMI and other variables. SDB was significantly more common in HIV− men in this study than those in SHHS, and was common in participants with BMIs <25 kg/m2. HIV+ men reported fatigue more frequently than HIV− men (25.5% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.003), but self-reported sleepiness did not differ among the three groups. Sleepiness, but not fatigue, was significantly associated with SDB. Conclusions SDB was highly prevalent in HIV− and HIV+ men, despite a normal or slightly elevated BMI. The high rate of SDB in men who have sex with men deserves further investigation. Sleepiness, but not fatigue, was related to the presence of SDB. Clinicians caring for HIV-infected patients should distinguish between fatigue and sleepiness when considering those at risk for SDB, especially in non-obese men."
https://openalex.org/W2059599142,"Epithelial stem cells are routinely lost or damaged during adult life and must therefore be replaced to maintain homeostasis. Recent studies indicate that stem cell replacement occurs through neutral competition in many types of epithelial tissues, but little is known about the factors that determine competitive outcome. The epithelial follicle stem cells (FSCs) in the Drosophila ovary are regularly lost and replaced during normal homeostasis, and we show that FSC replacement conforms to a model of neutral competition. In addition, we found that FSCs mutant for the basolateral junction genes, lethal giant larvae (lgl) or discs large (dlg), undergo a biased competition for niche occupancy characterized by increased invasion of neighboring FSCs and reduced loss. Interestingly, FSCs mutant for a third basolateral junction gene, scribble (scrib), do not exhibit biased competition, suggesting that Lgl and Dlg regulate niche competition through a Scrib-independent process. Lastly, we found that FSCs have a unique cell polarity characterized by broadly distributed adherens junctions and the lack of a mature apical domain. Collectively, these observations indicate that Lgl and Dlg promote the differentiation of FSC progeny to a state in which they are less prone to invade the neighboring niche. In addition, we demonstrate that the neutral drift model can be adapted to quantify non-neutral behavior of mutant clones."
https://openalex.org/W1983561455,"Research collaborations are encouraged because a synergistic effect yielding good results often appears. However, creating and organizing a strong research group is a difficult task. One of the greatest concerns of an individual researcher is locating potential collaborators whose expertise complement his best. In this paper, we propose a method that makes link predictions in co-authorship networks, where topological features between authors such as Adamic/Adar, Common Neighbors, Jaccard's Coefficient, Preferential Attachment, Katzβ, and PropFlow may be good indicators of their future collaborations. Firstly, these topological features were systematically extracted from the network. Then, supervised models were used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features in deciding co-author relationships. Finally, we tested our models on the co-authorship networks in the research field of Coronary Artery Disease and obtained encouraging accuracy (the precision, recall, F1 score and AUC were, respectively, 0.696, 0.677, 0.671 and 0.742 for Logistic Regression, and respectively, 0.697, 0.678, 0.671 and 0.743 for SVM).

https://openalex.org/W2078867802,"Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a transcription factor regulating proliferation and differentiation and is involved in cancer development. Oligomers of recombinant YY1 have been observed before, but their structure and DNA binding properties are not well understood. Here we find that YY1 assembles several homo-oligomeric species built from the association of a bell-shaped dimer, a process we characterized by electron microscopy. Moreover, we find that YY1 self-association also occurs in vivo using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Unexpectedly, these oligomers recognize several DNA substrates without the consensus sequence for YY1 in vitro, and DNA binding is enhanced in the presence of RuvBL1-RuvBL2, two essential AAA+ ATPases. YY1 oligomers bind RuvBL1-RuvBL2 hetero-oligomeric complexes, but YY1 interacts preferentially with RuvBL1. Collectively, these findings suggest that YY1-RuvBL1-RuvBL2 complexes could contribute to functions beyond transcription, and we show that YY1 and the ATPase activity of RuvBL2 are required for RAD51 foci formation during homologous recombination."

A random sample of 1,000,000 subjects covered by the National Health Insurance in 2005 was recruited. A total of 494,002 men and 502,948 women and without lung cancer were followed for the annual cumulative incidence of lung cancer in 2005, with calculation of the risk ratios between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Logistic regression estimated the adjusted odds ratios for risk factors. Results The trends increased significantly in both sexes (P<0.0001). The sex-specific annual cumulative incidence increased with age in either the diabetic or non-diabetic subjects, but the risk ratios attenuated with age. In logistic regressions, diabetes was associated with a significantly higher risk, with odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for diabetes duration <1, 1–3, 3–5 and ≥5 years versus non-diabetes of 2.189 (1.498-3.200), 1.420 (1.014-1.988), 1.545 (1.132-2.109), and 1.329 (1.063-1.660), respectively. Such an association was not related to a higher detection with chest X-ray examination. Insulin use and medications including oral anti-diabetic drugs, statin, fibrate, and anti-hypertensive agents were not significantly associated with lung cancer. Age, male sex, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were positively; but dyslipidemia, stroke and higher socioeconomic status were negatively associated with lung cancer. Conclusions Diabetes is significantly associated with a higher risk of lung cancer, but insulin use does not increase the risk."
https://openalex.org/W2064744212,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been instrumental in identifying novel genetic variants associated with altered plasma lipid levels. However, these quantitative trait loci have not been tested in the Indian population, where there is a poorly understood and growing burden of cardiometabolic disorders. We present the association of six single nucleotide polymorphisms in 1671 sib pairs (3342 subjects) with four lipid traits: total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). We also investigated the interaction effects of gender, location, fat intake and physical activity. Each copy of the risk allele of rs964184 at APOA1 was associated with 1.06 mmol/l increase in triglycerides (SE = 0.049; p = 0.006), rs3764261 at CETP with 1.02 mmol/l increase in both total cholesterol (SE = 0.042; p = 0.017) and HDL-C (SE = 0.041; p = 0.008), rs646776 at CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1 with 0.96 mmol/l decrease in cholesterol (SE = 0.043; p = 0.0003) and 0.15 mmol/l decrease in LDL-C levels (SE = 0.043; p = 0.0003) and rs2954029 at TRIB1 with 1.02 mmol/l increase in HDL-C (SE = 0.039; p = 0.047). A combined risk score of APOA1 and CETP loci predicted an increase of 1.25 mmol/l in HDL-C level (SE = 0.312; p = 0.0007). Urban location and sex had strong interaction effects on the genetic association of most of the studied loci with lipid traits. To conclude, we validated four genetic variants (identified by GWAS in western populations) associated with lipid traits in the Indian population. The interaction effects found here may explain the sex-specific differences in lipid levels and their heritability. Urbanization appears to influence the nature of the association with GWAS lipid loci in this population. However, these findings will require replication in other Indian populations."
https://openalex.org/W2130664298,"Introduction Approximately 26.3 million people in the United States have chronic kidney disease and many more are at risk of developing the condition. The association between specific metabolic syndrome components and chronic kidney disease in African American individuals is uncertain. Methods Baseline data from 4,933 participants of the Jackson Heart Study were analyzed. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds and 95% confidence intervals of chronic kidney disease associated with individual components, metabolic syndrome, the number of components, and specific combinations of metabolic syndrome components. Results Metabolic syndrome was common with a prevalence of 42.0%. Chronic kidney disease was present in 19.4% of participants. The prevalence of metabolic components was high: elevated blood pressure (71.8%), abdominal obesity (65.8%), low fasting high density lipoprotein cholesterol (37.3%), elevated fasting glucose (32.2%) and elevated triglycerides (16.2%). Elevated blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, and abdominal obesity were significantly associated with increased odds of chronic kidney disease. Participants with metabolic syndrome had a 2.22-fold (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.22; 95% CI, 1.78–2.78) increase in the odds of chronic kidney disease compared to participants without metabolic syndrome. The combination of elevated fasting glucose, elevated triglycerides, and abdominal obesity was associated with the highest odds for chronic kidney disease (AOR 25.11; 95% CI, 6.94–90.90). Conclusion Metabolic syndrome as well as individual or combinations of metabolic syndrome components are independently associated with chronic kidney disease in African American adults."
https://openalex.org/W2045488826,"Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been used as an anti-inflammatory treatment in several disease conditions, even when inflammation is a secondary consequence, such as in myocardial infarction (MI). However, the mechanism by which LLLT is able to protect the remaining myocardium remains unclear. The present study tested the hypothesis that LLLT reduces inflammation after acute MI in female rats and ameliorates cardiac function. The potential participation of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) and Kallikrein-Kinin System (KKS) vasoactive peptides was also evaluated. LLLT treatment effectively reduced MI size, attenuated the systolic dysfunction after MI, and decreased the myocardial mRNA expression of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 in comparison to the non-irradiated rat tissue. In addition, LLLT treatment increased protein and mRNA levels of the Mas receptor, the mRNA expression of kinin B2 receptors and the circulating levels of plasma kallikrein compared to non-treated post-MI rats. On the other hand, the kinin B1 receptor mRNA expression decreased after LLLT. No significant changes were found in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the myocardial remote area between laser-irradiated and non-irradiated post-MI rats. Capillaries density also remained similar between these two experimental groups. The mRNA expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was increased three days after MI, however, this effect was blunted by LLLT. Moreover, endothelial NOS mRNA content increased after LLLT. Plasma nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) concentration was increased three days after MI in non-treated rats and increased even further by LLLT treatment. Our data suggest that LLLT diminishes the acute inflammation in the myocardium, reduces infarct size and attenuates left ventricle dysfunction post-MI and increases vasoactive peptides expression and nitric oxide (NO) generation."
https://openalex.org/W2055701399,"Purpose The aim of the study is to investigate how adolescents' perception of parents' and peers' smoking approval influences adolescent smoking intention, and how age affects this influence in a Swiss sample of adolescents. To know the influence of age can help to develop specific prevention programs tailored to the age groups needs. Method in a cross sectional survey, students aged between 11 and 14 from public and private middle schools in the Italian region of Switzerland (Ticino) answered questions on smoking habits, parents' and peers' approval and intention to smoke. Results peers' and parents' approval significantly influence students' smoking intention, and students' age significantly moderates this relation: the effect of parents' approval decreases for older adolescents, while the effect of peers' approval increases with age. No difference is found between girls and boys, while non-Swiss are more likely to smoke than Swiss students. Conclusions as literature suggests, results evidence the role parents play during early adolescence. Prevention programs targeting parent-child communication in early adolescence for preventing children's tobacco consumption are strongly supported."
https://openalex.org/W2018635427,"Ribosome formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires a large number of transiently associated assembly factors that coordinate processing and folding of pre-rRNA and binding of ribosomal proteins. Krr1 and Faf1 are two interacting proteins present in early 90 S precursor particles of the small ribosomal subunit. Here, we determined a co-crystal structure of the core domain of Krr1 bound to a 19-residue fragment of Faf1 at 2.8 Å resolution. The structure reveals that Krr1 consists of two packed K homology (KH) domains, KH1 and KH2, and resembles archaeal Dim2-like proteins. We show that KH1 is a divergent KH domain that lacks the RNA-binding GXXG motif and is involved in binding another assembly factor, Kri1. KH2 contains a canonical RNA-binding surface and additionally associates with an α-helix of Faf1. Specific disruption of the Krr1-Faf1 interaction impaired early 18 S rRNA processing at sites A0, A1, and A2 and caused cell lethality, but it did not prevent incorporation of the two proteins into pre-ribosomes. The Krr1-Faf1 interaction likely maintains a critical conformation of 90 S pre-ribosomes required for pre-rRNA processing. Our results illustrate the versatility of KH domains in protein interaction and provide insight into the role of Krr1-Faf1 interaction in ribosome biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2083303418,"This paper describes the utilization of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a platform for handling chemical and biochemical reagents. GUVs with diameters of 5 to 10 µm and containing chemical/biochemical reagents together with inert polymers were fused with electric pulses (electrofusion). After reagent mixing, the fused GUVs spontaneously deformed to a budding shape, separating the mixed solution into sub-volumes. We utilized a microfluidic channel and optical tweezers to select GUVs of interest, bring them into contact, and fuse them together to mix and aliquot the reaction product. We also show that, by lowering the ambient temperature close to the phase transition temperature Tm of the lipid used, daughter GUVs completely detached (fission). This process performs all the liquid-handing features used in bench-top biochemistry using the GUV, which could be advantageous for the membrane-related biochemical assays."
https://openalex.org/W2034714263,"After years of implementing Roll Back Malaria (RBM) interventions, the changing landscape of malaria in terms of risk factors and spatial pattern has not been fully investigated. This paper uses the 2010 malaria indicator survey data to investigate if known malaria risk factors remain relevant after many years of interventions.We adopted a structured additive logistic regression model that allowed for spatial correlation, to more realistically estimate malaria risk factors. Our model included child and household level covariates, as well as climatic and environmental factors. Continuous variables were modelled by assuming second order random walk priors, while spatial correlation was specified as a Markov random field prior, with fixed effects assigned diffuse priors. Inference was fully Bayesian resulting in an under five malaria risk map for Malawi.Malaria risk increased with increasing age of the child. With respect to socio-economic factors, the greater the household wealth, the lower the malaria prevalence. A general decline in malaria risk was observed as altitude increased. Minimum temperatures and average total rainfall in the three months preceding the survey did not show a strong association with disease risk.The structured additive regression model offered a flexible extension to standard regression models by enabling simultaneous modelling of possible nonlinear effects of continuous covariates, spatial correlation and heterogeneity, while estimating usual fixed effects of categorical and continuous observed variables. Our results confirmed that malaria epidemiology is a complex interaction of biotic and abiotic factors, both at the individual, household and community level and that risk factors are still relevant many years after extensive implementation of RBM activities."
https://openalex.org/W2137529175,"Worldwide increases in fluvial fine sediment are a threat to aquatic animal health. Fluvial fine sediment is always a mixture of particles whose mineralogical composition differs depending on the sediment source and catchment area geology. Nonetheless, whether particle impact in aquatic organisms differs between mineral species remains to be investigated. This study applied an in vitro approach to evaluate cytotoxicity and uptake of four common fluvial mineral particles (quartz, feldspar, mica, and kaolin; concentrations: 10, 50, 250 mg L−1) in the rainbow trout epithelial gill cell line RTgill-W1. Cells were exposed for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Cytotoxicity assays for cell membrane integrity (propidium iodide assay), oxidative stress (H2DCF-DA assay), and metabolic activity (MTT assay) were applied. These assays were complemented with cell counts and transmission electron microscopy. Regardless of mineral species, particles ≤2 µm in diameter were taken up by the cells, suggesting that particles of all mineral species came into contact and interacted with the cells. Not all particles, however, caused strong cytotoxicity: Among all assays the tectosilicates quartz and feldspar caused sporadic maximum changes of 0.8–1.2-fold compared to controls. In contrast, cytotoxicity of the clay particles was distinctly stronger and even differed between the two particle types: mica induced concentration-dependent increases in free radicals, with consistent 1.6–1.8-fold-changes at the 250 mg L−1 concentration, and a dilated endoplasmic reticulum. Kaolin caused concentration-dependent increases in cell membrane damage, with consistent 1.3–1.6-fold increases at the 250 mg L−1 concentration. All effects occurred in the presence or absence of 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell numbers per se were marginally affected. Results indicate that (i.) natural mineral particles can be cytotoxic to gill epithelial cells, (ii.) their cytotoxic potential differs between mineral species, with clay particles being more cytotoxic, and (iii.) some clays might induce effects comparable to engineered nanoparticles."
https://openalex.org/W2015109204,"6-Pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) homologs in both mammals and bacteria catalyze distinct reactions using the same 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate substrate. The mammalian enzyme converts 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate to 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin, whereas the bacterial enzyme catalyzes the formation of 6-carboxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin. To understand the basis for the differential activities we determined the crystal structure of a bacterial PTPS homolog in the presence and absence of various ligands. Comparison to mammalian structures revealed that although the active sites are nearly structurally identical, the bacterial enzyme houses a His/Asp dyad that is absent from the mammalian protein. Steady state and time-resolved kinetic analysis of the reaction catalyzed by the bacterial homolog revealed that these residues are responsible for the catalytic divergence. This study demonstrates how small variations in the active site can lead to the emergence of new functions in existing protein folds."
https://openalex.org/W2144010993,"Several studies suggest that cardiovascular risk factors comprising the metabolic syndrome have larger effects on the development of cardiovascular disease in women than in men. A recent study in self-reported healthy subjects demonstrated a marked gender difference in endothelial dysfunction that may be an important precursor of manifest cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the association between endothelial function and cardiovascular risk factors is different in self-reported healthy women compared to self-reported healthy men.Associations between endothelial function (flow mediated dilation, FMD, of the brachial artery measured by ultrasound), anthropometric variables, peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), blood pressure, serum lipids, blood glucose and a questionnaire on general health and lifestyle including smoking status were studied by logistic and linear regression in 2 528 women and 2 211 men aged 20-89 years, free from self-reported cardiovascular disease. In women with hyperglycemia, endothelial dysfunction (FMD ≤0%) occurred twice as frequently as in male counterparts. The presence of the metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure and low VO2peak increased the prevalence of endothelial dysfunction more in women than in men.Endothelial dysfunction is more strongly associated with cardiovascular risk factors in self-reported healthy women than in self-reported healthy men. This finding could explain why the metabolic syndrome, and especially hyperglycemia, is associated with higher cardiovascular risk and a worse prognosis in women."
https://openalex.org/W2062167723,"Background Few reports have examined the viral aetiology of fever of unknown origin (FUO). Objective This study determined the prevalence of human herpes virus (HHV) DNA in blood of Chinese patients with classic FUO using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and explored the possible role of HHV. Study design Blood samples were collected from 186 patients (151 children, 35 adults) with classic FUO and 143 normal individuals in Beijing during the years 2009–2012. The HHV DNA, including Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1/2, Varicella zoster virus (VZV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), and Human herpes virus (HHV)-6 and -7, was detected by multiplex PCR. The epidemiological and clinical features were also analysed. Results HHV DNA was detected in 63 (33.9%) of the FUO patients, and the prevalence of EBV and HHV-6 was significantly higher than in the normal cohort. HHV co-infection was also frequent (10.2%) in the patients with FUO. The majority of patients with HHV infection present with a fever only. Our data also revealed that EBV infection was associated with hepatitis and abnormal blood indices, HHV-6 was associated with a cough, and HHV-7 was associated with hepatitis. Conclusions HHVs are associated with Chinese patients (especially for children) with classic FUO. Our study adds perspective to the aetiological and clinical characteristics of classic FUO in beijing patients."
https://openalex.org/W2063630222,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infections remain a significant health care problem due to high morbidity and mortality associated with GAS diseases, along with their increasing worldwide prevalence. Macrophages play a key role in the control and clearance of GAS infections. Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokines production and GAS persistence and invasion are related. In this study we investigated the correlation between the GAS clinical isolates genotypes, their known clinical history, and their ability to modulate innate immune response. We constituted a collection of 40 independent GAS isolates representative of the emm types currently prevalent in France and responsible for invasive (57.5%) and non-invasive (42.5%) clinical manifestations. We tested phagocytosis and survival in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and quantified the pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNF-α) and type I interferon (INF-β) production. Invasive emm89 isolates were more phagocytosed than their non-invasive counterparts, and emm89 isolates more than the other isolates. Regarding the survival, differences were observed depending on the isolate emm type, but not between invasive and non-invasive isolates within the same emm type. The level of inflammatory mediators produced was also emm type-dependent and mostly invasiveness status independent. Isolates of the emm1 type were able to induce the highest levels of both pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas emm89 isolates induced the earliest production of IFN-β. Finally, even within emm types, there was a variability of the innate immune responses induced, but survival and inflammatory mediator production were not linked."
https://openalex.org/W2081289685,"Salidroside, extracted from the root of Rhodiola rosea L, is known for its pharmacological properties, in particular its neuroprotective effects. 2-(4-Methoxyphenyl) ethyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-pyranoside (GlcNAc-Sal), an analog of salidroside, was recently synthesized and shown to possess neuroprotective properties. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of GlcNAc-Sal against oxygen-glucose deprivation-reperfusion (OGD-R)-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (GCI-R) injury in vivo. Cell viability tests and Hoechst 33342 staining confirmed that GlcNAc-Sal pretreatment markedly attenuated OGD-R induced apoptotic cell death in immortalized mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. Western blot, immunofluorescence and PCR analyses revealed that GlcNAc-Sal pretreatment restored the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins and inhibited the activation of caspase-3 and PARP induced by OGD-R treatment. Further analyses showed that GlcNAc-Sal pretreatment antagonized reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, iNOS-derived NO production and NO-related apoptotic cell death during OGD-R stimulation. GCI-R was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) and reperfusion in mice in vivo. Western blot analysis showed that GlcNAc-Sal pretreatment decreased the expression of caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2)/Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) induced by GCI-R treatment. Our findings suggest that GlcNAc-Sal pretreatment prevents brain ischemia reperfusion injury by the direct or indirect suppression of cell apoptosis and GlcNAc-Sal could be developed as a broad-spectrum agent for the prevention and/or treatment of cerebral ischemic injury."

https://openalex.org/W2051797957,"Setting During endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the endoribonuclease (RNase) Ire1α initiates removal of a 26 nt region from the mRNA encoding the transcription factor Xbp1 via an unconventional mechanism (atypically within the cytosol). This causes an open reading frame-shift that leads to altered transcriptional regulation of numerous downstream genes in response to ER stress as part of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Strikingly, other examples of targeted, unconventional splicing of short mRNA regions have yet to be reported. Objective Our goal was to develop an approach to identify non-canonical, possibly very short, splicing regions using RNA-Seq data and apply it to ER stress-induced Ire1α heterozygous and knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines to identify additional Ire1α targets. Results We developed a bioinformatics approach called the Read-Split-Walk (RSW) pipeline, and evaluated it using two Ire1α heterozygous and two Ire1α-null samples. The 26 nt non-canonical splice site in Xbp1 was detected as the top hit by our RSW pipeline in heterozygous samples but not in the negative control Ire1α knockout samples. We compared the Xbp1 results from our approach with results using the alignment program BWA, Bowtie2, STAR, Exonerate and the Unix “grep” command. We then applied our RSW pipeline to RNA-Seq data from the SKBR3 human breast cancer cell line. RSW reported a large number of non-canonical spliced regions for 108 genes in chromosome 17, which were identified by an independent study. Conclusions We conclude that our RSW pipeline is a practical approach for identifying non-canonical splice junction sites on a genome-wide level. We demonstrate that our pipeline can detect novel splice sites in RNA-Seq data generated under similar conditions for multiple species, in our case mouse and human."

According to the results obtained from the 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) method, there were no significant differences among treatment groups analysed. When was using 1,1-diphenyl-2-pycrylhydrazyl method (DPPH), beans cooked without maceration present the higher antioxidant activity, and raw beans the lower. The phenolic acids found in greater amounts were gallic acid and chlorogenic acid. Kaempferol was only detected in the soaked and cooked samples; catechin and kaempferol-3-rutinoside were found in the highest concentrations. Quercetin and kaempferol-3-glucoside were not affected by the cooking process, either with or without maceration. In general, the heat treatment increased the antioxidant activity."
https://openalex.org/W2026988435,"Sexuality in the marine araphid diatom Tabularia involves an unusual type of gamete, not only among diatoms but possibly in all of nature. The non-flagellated male gamete is free and vigorously motile, propelled by pseudopodia. However, the cues (if any) in their search for compatible female gametes and the general search patterns to locate them are unknown. We tracked and compared male gamete movements in the presence and absence of receptive female gametes. Path linearity of male movement was not affected by presence of female gametes. Male gametes did not move towards female gametes regardless of their proximity to each other, suggesting that the detection range for a compatible mate is very small compared to known algal examples (mostly spermatozoids) and that mate recognition requires (near) contact with a female gamete. We therefore investigated how male gametes move to bring insight into their search strategy and found that it was consistent with the predictions of a random-walk model with changes in direction coming from an even distribution. We further investigated the type of random walk by determining the best-fit distribution on the tail of the move length distribution and found it to be consistent with a truncated power law distribution with an exponent of 2.34. Although consistent with a Lévy walk search pattern, the range of move lengths in the tail was too narrow for Lévy properties to emerge and so would be best described as Brownian motion. This is somewhat surprising because female gametes were often outnumbered by male gametes, thus contrary to the assumption that a Brownian search mode may be most optimal with an abundant target resource. This is also the first mathematically analysed search pattern of a non-flagellated protistan gamete, supporting the notion that principles of Brownian motion have wide application in biology."
https://openalex.org/W2059448169,"Structural studies have revealed that the core of the ribosome structure is conserved among ribosomes of all kingdoms. Kingdom-specific ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) are located in peripheral parts of the ribosome. In this work, the interactions between rRNA and r-proteins of eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome were investigated applying LiCl induced splitting and quantitative mass spectrometry. R-proteins were divided into four groups according to their binding properties to the rRNA. Most yeast r-proteins are removed from rRNA by 0.5–1 M LiCl. Eukaryote-specific r-proteins are among the first to dissociate. The majority of the strong binders are known to be required for the early ribosome assembly events. As compared to the bacterial ribosome, yeast r-proteins are dissociated from rRNA at lower ionic strength.

https://openalex.org/W2091600400,"Background After being polio free for more than 10 years, an outbreak following importation of wild poliovirus (WPV) was confirmed in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, in 2011. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted prior to supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), immediately after the confirmation of the WPV outbreak. In selected prefectures, participants aged ≤60 years old who visited hospitals at county-level or above to have their blood drawn for reasons not related to the study, were invited to participate in our study. Antibody titers ≥8 were considered positive. Results Among the 2,611 participants enrolled, 2,253 (86.3%), 2,283 (87.4%), and 1,989 (76.2%) were seropositive to P1, P2 and P3 respectively, and 1744 (66.8%) participants were seropositive to all the three serotypes. Lower antibody seropositivities and geometric mean titers were observed in children <1 year of age and in adults aged 15–39 years. Conclusion Serosurveys to estimate population immunity in districts at high risk of polio importation might be useful to gauge underlying population immunity gaps to polio and possibly to guide preparedness and response planning. Consideration should be given to older children and adults during polio risk assessment planning and outbreak response."
