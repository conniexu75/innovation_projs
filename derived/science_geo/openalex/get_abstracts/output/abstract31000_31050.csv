https://openalex.org/W2083447043,"Two metabolites of the steroid hormones progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone and 3 alpha, 5 alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, are potent barbiturate-like ligands of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-chloride ion channel complex. At concentrations between 10(-7) and 10(-5)M both steroids inhibited binding of the convulsant t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate to the GABA-receptor complex and increased the binding of the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam; they also stimulated chloride uptake (as measured by uptake of 36Cl-) into isolated brain vesicles, and potentiated the inhibitory actions of GABA in cultured rat hippocampal and spinal cord neurons. These data may explain the ability of certain steroid hormones to rapidly alter neuronal excitability and may provide a mechanism for the anesthetic and hypnotic actions of naturally occurring and synthetic anesthetic steroids."

https://openalex.org/W1483833346,"The effect of the plant alkaloid ryanodine on the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channel was studied by determining the Ca2+ permeability of heavy vesicles passively loaded with 45Ca2+ in the presence or absence of ryanodine. Depending on the experimental conditions, ryanodine either stimulated or inhibited Ca2+ efflux. Vesicles were rendered permeable to 45Ca2+ at a ryanodine concentration of 0.01 microM when diluted into a medium containing the two Ca2+ release channel inhibitors Mg2+ and ruthenium red. At ryanodine concentrations greater than 10 microM, 45Ca2+ efflux was inhibited in channel-activating (5 microM Ca2+) or -inhibiting (10 mM Mg2+ plus 10 microM ruthenium red) media. An optimal stimulatory effect was observed when vesicles were incubated with ryanodine at 37 degrees C and in media that caused partial opening of the channel. Similar results to those described above were obtained using cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles that were capable of rapid 45Ca2+ efflux. Use of the slowly permeating molecule L-[3H]glucose allowed measurement of channel-mediated efflux rates from vesicles in the presence and absence of ryanodine. At low activating concentrations, ryanodine did not appreciably change the regulation of L-glucose efflux rates by external Ca2+, Mg2+, and adenine nucleotide. These results suggested two possible modes of action of ryanodine: 1) a change in the gating mechanism of the channel which is not readily detected using the slowly permeating molecule L-glucose or 2) a change in channel structure which prevents its complete closing."
https://openalex.org/W2037968180,"The met oncogene activated in vitro by treatment of a human osteogenic sarcoma (HOS) cell line with N-methyl-N'-nitronitrosoguanidine (MNNG) is related to the tyrosine kinase gene family. Probes from the met oncogene locus recognize two distinct transcripts of 9.0 kb and 10.0 kb which are independently expressed in a cell-type-specific fashion. While the met proto-oncogene locus expresses the 9.0 kb RNA and maps to human chromosome 7q21-31, the locus expressing the 10.0 kb RNA, (tpr; translocated promoter region) maps to human chromosome 1. Both MNNG-HOS cells and met NIH 3T3 transformants express a novel 5.0 kb RNA which represents a hybrid transcript with 5' sequences derived from tpr and 3' sequences from the met proto-oncogene. Treating HOS cells in vitro with MNNG, a known clastogenic carcinogen, resulted in fusion of two chromosomally disparate loci, met and tpr, generating the active met oncogene."

https://openalex.org/W2071702312,"Hippocampal inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are depolarizing in granule cells but hyperpolarizing in CA3 neurons because the reversal potentials and membrane potentials of these cells differ. Here the hippocampal slice preparation was used to investigate the role of chloride transport in these inhibitory responses. In both cell types, increasing the intracellular chloride concentration by injection shifted the reversal potential of these responses in a positive direction, and blocking the outward transport of chloride with furosemide slowed their recovery from the injection. In addition, hyperpolarizing and depolarizing inhibitory responses and the hyperpolarizing and depolarizing responses to the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid decreased in the presence of furosemide. These effects of furosemide suggest that the internal chloride activity of an individual hippocampal neuron is regulated by two transport processes, one that accumulates chloride and one that extrudes chloride."

https://openalex.org/W2035143633,"Caffeine was shown to induce mitotic events in mammalian cells before DNA replication (S phase) was completed. Synchronized BHK cells that were arrested in early S phase underwent premature chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, morphological ""rounding up,"" and mitosis-specific phosphoprotein synthesis when they were exposed to caffeine. These mitotic responses occurred only after the cells had entered S phase and only while DNA synthesis was inhibited by more than 70 percent. Inhibitors of protein synthesis blocked these caffeine-induced events, while inhibitors of RNA synthesis had little effect. These results suggest that caffeine induces the translation or stabilizes the protein product (or products) of mitosis-related RNA that accumulates in S-phase cells when DNA replication is suppressed. The ability to chemically manipulate the onset of mitosis should be useful for studying the regulation of this event in mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W1975549159,"A new serine protease was encoded by a clone isolated from a murine cytotoxic T-lymphocyte complementary DNA library by an RNA-hybridization competition protocol. Complementary transcripts were detected in cytotoxic T lymphocytes, spleen cells from nude mice, a rat natural killer cell leukemia, and in two of eight T-helper clones (both cytotoxic), but not in normal mouse kidney, liver, spleen, or thymus, nor in several tested T- and B-cell tumors. T-cell activation with concanavalin A plus interleukin-2 induced spleen cells to express this gene with kinetics correlating with the acquisition of cytolytic capacity. The nucleotide sequence of this gene encoded an amino acid sequence of approximately 25,700 daltons, with 25 to 35 percent identity to members of the serine protease family. The active site ""charge-relay"" residues (His57, Asp102, and Ser195 of the chymotrypsin numbering system) are conserved, as well as the trypsin-specific Asp (position 189 in trypsin). A Southern blot analysis indicated that this gene is conserved in humans, mouse, and chicken. This serine protease may have a role in lymphocyte lysis and a ""lytic cascade."""
https://openalex.org/W2071944390,"Genetic recombination of DNA is one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the evolution of DNA-based organisms and results in their diversity and adaptability. The importance of the role of recombination is far less evident for the RNA-based genomes that occur in most plant viruses and in many animal viruses. RNA recombination has been shown to promote the evolutionary variation of picornaviruses1–4, it is involved in the creation of defective interfering (DI) RNAs of positive- and negative-strand viruses5–9 and is implicated in the synthesis of the messenger RNAs of influenza virus10 and coronavirus11. However, RNA recombination has not been found to date in viruses that infect plants. In fact, the lack of DI RNAs and the inability to demonstrate recombination in mixedly infected plants has been regarded as evidence that plants do not support recombination of viral RNAs. Here we provide the first molecular evidence for recombination of plant viral RNA. For brome mosaic virus (BMV), a plus-stranded, tripartite-genome virus of monocots, we show that a deletion in the 3′ end region of a single BMV RNA genomic component can be repaired during the development of infection by recombination with the homologous region of either of the two remaining wild-type BMV RNA components. This result clearly shows that plant viruses have available powerful recombinatory mechanisms that previously were thought to exist only in animal hosts, thus they are able to adapt and diversify in a manner comparable to animal viruses. Moreover, our observation suggests an increased versatility of viruses for use as vectors in introducing new genes into plants."

https://openalex.org/W2099779947,"The mechanism of chloride transport by airway epithelia has been of substantial interest because airway and sweat gland-duct epithelia are chloride-impermeable in cystic fibrosis. The decreased chloride permeability prevents normal secretion by the airway epithelium, thereby interfering with mucociliary clearance and contributing to the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Because chloride secretion depends on and is regulated by chloride conductance in the apical cell membrane, the patch-clamp technique was used to directly examine single-channel currents in primary cultures of human tracheal epithelium. The cells contained an anion-selective channel that was not strongly voltage-gated or regulated by calcium in cell-free patches. The channel was also blocked by analogs of carboxylic acid that decrease apical chloride conductance in intact epithelia. When attached to the cell, the channel was activated by isoproterenol, although the channel was also observed to open spontaneously. However, in some cases, the channel was only observed after the patch was excised from the cell. These results suggest that this channel is responsible for the apical chloride conductance in airway epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W102745621,"The regulation of the synthesis of plasma proteins in rat liver during the acute phase response was studied by measuring gene transcription activities in a cell-free nuclear transcription system. The transcription activities for the genes of major acute phase alpha 1-protein, the beta-chain of fibrinogen, transferrin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and alpha 2-macroglobulin increased, reaching a maximum level between 18 and 36 h after inducing an acute inflammation. The transcription activities for the genes of alpha 2u-globulin, albumin, and transthyretin (formerly called prealbumin) decreased, reaching a minimum level after 12 to 24 h. The extent of the relative changes in transcription activities was similar to that of the relative changes in mRNA levels for major acute phase alpha 1-protein, the beta-chain of fibrinogen, transferrin, alpha 2u-globulin, albumin, and transthyretin. This is consistent with the assumption that the principal mechanism of the regulation of the synthesis of these proteins operates at the level of transcription. In contrast, the relative changes in transcription activities for alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and alpha 2-macroglobulin were far smaller than the changes of their mRNA levels, suggesting that, in addition to transcriptional changes, other mechanism(s) are involved in the regulation of the synthesis of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2024227714,"The yolk protein 1 gene (yp1) of Drosophila melanogaster is expressed only in the ovarian follicle cells and the fat bodies of adult females. We have previously shown that a different cis-acting DNA region is required for each of these tissue specificities. In this paper we use germ line transformation to localize and characterized one of these tissue-specific regulatory regions. We demonstrate that a 125 bp segment of DNA located 196 bp upstream of the yp1 cap site is sufficient to determine the sex-, stage-, and fat body-specific expression of the yp1 gene. We also find that this region can confer yp1-specific expression on a heterologous Drosophila promoter. This specificity is retained when the region is in different orientations and at different distances from the heterologous promoter. Thus a small regulatory region acts in vivo as a positive enhancer to determine the fat body expression pattern of yp1."

https://openalex.org/W1494064731,"Rat genomic clones were used to quantitate preprotachykinin mRNAs in the rat basal ganglia, while the tachykinin peptide products substance P and substance K were measured by radioimmunoassay. Administration of the dopamine antagonist (antipsychotic) drug haloperidol significantly decreased substance P, substance K, and both alpha (substance P encoding) and beta (substance P/substance K encoding) preprotachykinin mRNAs, suggesting a drug-induced decrease in striatonigral tachykinin biosynthesis. The time course for decreased preprotachykinin mRNAs and tachykinins apparently parallels the period of maximum risk for the development of certain antipsychotic drug-induced extrapyramidal side effects seen clinically. Tachykinin interaction with dopamine neurons may play an important role in the modulation of basal ganglia function."
https://openalex.org/W1967274237,"RNAs containing the polyadenylation sites for adenovirus L3 or E2a mRNA or for SV40 early or late mRNA are substrates for cleavage and poly(A) addition in an extract of HeLa cell nuclei. When polyadenylation reactions are probed with ribonuclease T1 and antibodies directed against either the Sm protein determinant or the trimethylguanosine cap structure at the 5' end of U RNAs in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, RNA fragments containing the AAUAAA polyadenylation signal are immunoprecipitated. The RNA cleavage step that occurs prior to poly(A) addition is inhibited by micrococcal nuclease digestion of the nuclear extract. The immunoprecipitation of fragments containing the AAUAAA sequence can be altered, but not always abolished, by pretreatment with micrococcal nuclease. We discuss the involvement of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins in the cleavage and poly(A) addition reactions that form the 3' ends of most eukaryotic mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1978194746,"The purpose of this article is to review the current state of large-scale cell culture in terms of its applications, problems, and potential. Because of the commercial and proprietary nature of most large-scale cell culture processes, this review does not contain many detailed scientific results although an attempt is made to address some key issues and findings. Much of this summary deals with processes having an established, commercial track record but some attention is given to more recent innovations with interesting potential applications. Reference is made to plant cell culture but the main emphasis is on mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W1541731980,"We describe the polypeptide structure and some of the catalytic properties of a DNA polymerase alpha.DNA primase complex that can be prepared from KB cells by immunoaffinity purification. The procedure is based on monoclonal antibodies that were raised against a biochemically purified, catalytically active core protomer of the polymerase. In all respects tested, the basic mechanism of substrate recognition and binding by the immunoaffinity-purified polymerase is qualitatively identical to that of the core protomer. The immunoaffinity-purified KB cell polymerase alpha X DNA primase is structurally complex. On the basis of extensive immunochemical analyses with five independent monoclonal antibodies, three of which are potent neutralizers of polymerase alpha activity, peptide mapping studies, and the application of a sensitive immunoassay that permits detection of polymerase alpha antigens in crude cell lysates, we have established that the principal form of catalytically active DNA polymerase alpha in KB cells is a phosphoprotein with a molecular mass of 180 kilodaltons. This protein is stable in vivo, with an estimated half-life of greater than or equal to 15 h. In contrast, the polypeptide is extremely fragile in vitro and generates partial degradation products of p165, p140, and p125 that explain the microheterogeneity typically exhibited by polymerase alpha peptides in denaturing polyacrylamide gels. In addition to the catalytically active polymerase alpha polypeptide(s), the immunopurified enzyme fraction typically contains three other proteins, p77, p55, and p49, the functions of which have not yet been established. These proteins do not display polymerase alpha epitopes and have been shown by peptide mapping to be independent species that are unrelated either to the large polymerase peptides or to one another. The polypeptide p77 is also a phosphoprotein, and in both p180 and p77 the phosphorylated amino acids are exclusively serine and threonine."
https://openalex.org/W1552057761,"The beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG beta) is reportedly encoded by as many as seven non-allelic genes or pseudogenes. Previous studies have identified a cluster of three hCG beta gene copies and the single-copy lutropin-beta subunit (LH beta) gene, but overlap of this cluster with two additional pairs of hCG beta genes has not been demonstrated, despite the isolation of 18 genomic clones. To define the number and organization of non-allelic hCG beta gene copies, genomic Southern blot analyses were performed using hCG beta cDNA and gene-flanking unique-sequence probes. The data show the linear arrangement of six genes (or pseudogenes) and show that the hCG beta-IH beta gene cluster is present in a single 58-kilobase EcoRI fragment. Our map of the cluster indicates which of the cloned hCG beta genes reflect somatic genotypes rather than recombinant artifacts and will thus permit investigation of factors regulating expression during gestation."
https://openalex.org/W2092166192,"During bone resorption, the osteoclast actively acidifies a limited extracellular compartment. We hypothesized that, like other cells engaged in ion transport and proton translocation, the osteoclast's membrane might be highly enriched in sodium pumps. Using monoclonal antibodies to both the α and the β subunits, immunoblot analysis, and [3H]ouabain binding, we have demonstrated that the osteoclast plasma membrane is both highly and specifically enriched in (Na+,K+)ATPase, compared with other bone cells, monocytes, macrophages, and other blood and bone marrow cells. The density of binding sites on the osteoclast is equivalent to that of kidney tubule cells. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the (Na+,K+)ATPase plays a role in the mechanism of bone resorption, possibly coupled with secondary active calcium and/or proton transport. Monoclonal antibodies against the (Na+,K+)ATPase can therefore be used as specific markers for the osteoclast in bone and bone marrow preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1532068605,"H1t is a testis-specific H1 variant found in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids of mammals. The H1t gene was isolated from the Sargent-Bonner library of recombinant lambda bacteriophage containing EcoRI fragments of rat liver DNA using a hybridization probe derived from a chicken H1 variant. The rat H1t gene encodes a 207-amino acid protein (ignoring the initiating methionine) that matches perfectly what is known of the sequence and composition of H1t isolated from rat testes. The gene lacks introns and has good matches to all the consensus sequences known to lie upstream from a variety of H1 genes from diverse organisms. It also has the standard downstream palindromic sequence that specifies the 3'-end of most histone messages. Accordingly, the features of the gene or its environs that restrict its expression to a particular phase of spermatogenesis are not yet evident."
https://openalex.org/W1590438213,"The translocation of UDP-glucose and GDP-mannose from an external to a luminal compartment has been examined in rat liver vesicles derived from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). RER vesicles with the same topographical orientation as in vivo were incubated with a mixture of [3H]UDP-glucose and UDP-[14C]glucose to demonstrate that the intact sugar nucleotide was translocated into the lumen of the vesicles. The translocation of UDP-glucose was dependent on temperature and was saturable at high concentrations of the sugar nucleotide. The transfer of glucose to endogenous acceptors was dependent on the translocation of UDP-glucose into the lumen of the RER since leaky vesicles resulted in both a decrease in transport and transfer of glucose to endogenous acceptors. Preliminary results suggest that the mechanism of UDP-glucose transport into RER-derived vesicles is via a coupled exchange with luminal UMP. Using the same experimental approach to detect translocation of UDP-glucose into the lumen of RER vesicles, we were unable to detect transport of GDP-mannose. Incubation of leaky vesicles with GDP-mannose resulted in stimulation of the amount of mannose transferred to endogenous acceptors, in marked contrast to that observed for UDP-glucose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. These results suggest that whereas UDP-glucose is translocated across the RER membrane in vitro, GDP-mannose is not transported. In addition, these results tentatively suggest that there is asymmetric synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharides within the membrane of the RER."
https://openalex.org/W1514499212,"The gene defining the catalytic RNA component of RNase P in Bacillus subtilis 168 was cloned into bacteriophage lambda and plasmid vectors. The nucleotide sequence of the gene and its surroundings was determined from the cloned DNA and by directly sequencing or reverse transcribing the RNase P RNA. The B. subtilis RNase P RNA sequence (400-401 nucleotides) is remarkably different from that of Escherichia coli (377 nucleotides) (Reed, R. E., Baer, M. F., Guerrier-Takada, C., Donis-Keller, H., and Altman, S. (1982) Cell 30, 627-636; Sakamoto, H., Kimura, N., Nagawa, F., and Shimura, Y. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 8237-8251). At best the two are less than 50% similar in sequence. To verify that the RNase P RNA gene was analyzed, a modified, putative gene was cloned adjacent to a bacteriophage T7 promoter and various transcripts were tested for RNase P activity. The intact gene transcript, but not fragments, showed full activity. Full catalytic activity was restored upon mixing the fragments. The extensive differences between the B. subtilis and E. coli RNase P RNAs precluded full covariance analysis of secondary structure, but phylogenetically consistent foldings for portions of both molecules could be derived."

https://openalex.org/W1578177519,"The purified DNA replication proteins encoded by genes 41 and 61 of bacteriophage T4 catalyze efficient RNA primer synthesis on a single-stranded DNA template. In the presence of additional T4 replication proteins, we demonstrate that the template sequences 5'-GTT-3' and 5'-GCT-3' serve as necessary and sufficient signals for RNA primer-dependent initiation of new DNA chains. These chains start with primers that have the sequences pppApCpNpNpN and pppGpCpNpNpN, where N can be any one of the four ribonucleotides. Each primer is initiated from the T (A-start primers) or C (G-start primers) in the center of the recognized template sequence. A subset of the DNA chain starts is observed when one of the four ribonucleoside triphosphates used as the substrates for primer synthesis is omitted; the starts observed reveal that both pentaribonucleotide and tetraribonucleotide primers can be used for efficient initiation of new DNA chains, whereas primers that are only 3 nucleotides long are inactive. It was known previously that, when 61 protein is present in catalytic amounts, the 41 and 61 proteins are both required for observing RNA primer synthesis. However, by raising the concentration of the 61 protein to a much higher level, a substantial amount of RNA-primed DNA synthesis is obtained in the absence of 41 protein. The DNA chains made are initiated by primers that seem to be identical to those made when both 41 and 61 proteins are present; however, only those template sites containing the 5'-GCT-3' sequence are utilized. The 61 protein is, therefore, the RNA primase, whereas the 41 protein should be viewed as a DNA helicase that is required (presumably via a 41/61 complex) for efficient primase recognition of both the 5'-GCT-3' and 5'-GTT-3' DNA template sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1519765807,"Type IX collagen is a recently characterized product of chondrocytes. The molecules of this collagen are heterotrimers of three genetically distinct polypeptide chains. One of the three chains contains chondroitin and/or dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains, giving the molecule a proteoglycan character. In fact, Type IX collagen has been identified with the proteoglycan Lt (PG-Lt), first isolated by Noro, A., Kimata, K., Oike, Y., Shinomura, T., Maeda, N., Yano, S., Takahashi, N., and Suzuki, S.

Based on amino acid sequences predicted from the nucleotide sequences of cDNA and genomic clones specific for two of the chains of Type IX collagen, we have synthesized oligopeptides representing portions of the two chains. In addition, an oligopeptide has been made based on a partial amino acid sequence of the third chain. Antibodies against the synthetic peptides have been generated in rabbits, and the polyclonal sera have allowed identification of the three genetically distinct polypeptide subunits of Type IX collagen. In addition, labeling with [35S]sulfate and treatment with chondroitinase ABC demonstrates that glycosaminoglycan chains are present on the subunit that has been given the designation alpha 2(IX)."
https://openalex.org/W1567992617,"The present study examines the possible role of sodium channels in the behavioral effects of cocaine. Cocaine congeners are apparent competitive inhibitors of the scorpion toxin-enhanced binding of [3H]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate to sodium channels in mouse cerebrocortical synaptosomes. However, in agreement with the allosteric model for heterotropic cooperative interactions, the compounds produce a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of dissociation of binding. Concentrations that give a 2-fold increase of k-1 are close to Ki values for inhibiting equilibrium binding of [3H]bactrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate, suggesting that the inhibitory effect on binding results mostly from an increase of the apparent dissociation rate constant. The ester linkage between the tropane and benzoyl ring of cocaine is not essential for the inhibitory potency, and for both the C-2 and C-3 substituents the equatorial position results in a higher potency than the axial position. There is reasonable agreement between the rank order of potencies in blocking the sodium channel and in inhibiting locomotor behavior. The present results do not support a relationship between the capability of cocaine congeners in blocking sodium flux and in inhibiting uptake of dopamine into striatal synaptosomes. However, peak levels of cocaine in the brain of cocaine addicts could be high enough to interfere with sodium channel functioning, possibly contributing to some of cocaine's actions."
https://openalex.org/W1574286769,"Geographutoxin II (GTX II), a peptide toxin isolated from Conus geographus, inhibited [3H]saxitoxin binding to receptor sites associated with voltage-sensitive Na channels in rat skeletal muscle homogenates and rabbit T-tubular membranes with K0.5 values of 60 nM for homogenates and 35 nM for T-tubular membranes in close agreement with concentrations that block muscle contraction. Scatchard analysis of [3H]saxitoxin binding to T-tubular membranes gave values of KD = 9.3 nM and Bmax = 300 fmol/mg of protein and revealed a primarily competitive mode of inhibition of saxitoxin binding by GTX II. The calculated KD values for GTX II were 24 nM for T-tubules and 35 nM for homogenates, respectively. In rat brain synaptosomes, GTX II caused a similar inhibitory effect on [3H]saxitoxin binding at substantially higher concentrations (K0.5 = 2 microM). In contrast, binding of [3H]batrachotoxin A 20-alpha-benzoate and 125I-labeled scorpion toxin to receptor sites associated with Na channels in synaptosomes was not affected by GTX II at concentrations up to 10 microM. Furthermore, [3H]saxitoxin binding to membranes of rat superior cervical ganglion was only blocked 10% by GTX II at 10 microM. These results indicate that GTX II interacts competitively with saxitoxin in binding at neurotoxin receptor site 1 on the sodium channel in a highly tissue-specific manner. GTX II is the first polypeptide ligand for this receptor site and the first to discriminate between this site on nerve and adult muscle sodium channels."
https://openalex.org/W1596362474,"Incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into tyrosine residues of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II receptor was observed in a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of rat adipocyte plasma membranes. IGF-II receptor phosphorylation proceeded to a stoichiometry of approximately 0.5 mol of phosphate/IGF-II binding site after 10 min of incubation at 4 degrees C. A Km for ATP of 6 microM was calculated for this phosphorylation reaction. Addition of IGF-II caused an approximately 2-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-II receptor in this preparation. In contrast, phosphorylation of angiotensin II by the Triton X-100 washed membranes was not stimulated by IGF-II. Incubation of purified receptor immobilized on IGF-II agarose or of receptor-enriched low density microsomal membranes with [gamma-32P]ATP did not result in appreciable incorporation of [32P]phosphate into the IGF-II receptor nor into exogenous substrates. These data suggest that the IGF-II receptor is not a tyrosine protein kinase capable of autophosphorylation but that it is a substrate for a tyrosine protein kinase endogenous to the adipocyte plasma membrane. The stimulatory effect of IGF-II on the tyrosine phosphorylation of its receptor may be due to a conformational change which converts the receptor to a better substrate for this tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2009525110,The activities of both chymotrypsin and amylase in individual zymogen granules of rat pancreas were measured by means of micromanipulation and microfluorometric methods. The enzyme content and the ratio of amylase to chymotrypsin varied widely among granules taken from the same animal. These results are compatible with short-term nonparallel bulk secretion of the two enzymes through exocytosis. The distribution of each enzyme activity in a population of granules suggests quantal packaging of amylase and chymotrypsinogen into the granules.
https://openalex.org/W1526759183,"Steroid-8-ene isomerase that catalyzes isomerization of delta 8- to delta 7-sterols has been solubilized from rat liver microsomes with a mixture of two detergents, octylglucoside and sodium taurodeoxycholic acid. During a 40-fold enrichment of the solubilized enzyme, other enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis, endogenous lipids, and electron carriers are removed. A comparison of properties of the solubilized and partially purified isomerase with the membrane-bound enzyme shows they are essentially identical with respect to pH profile, effect of inhibitors and cofactors, substrate specificity, and Km values. Addition of phospholipid to the partially purified enzyme stimulates activity as much as 1.8-fold over control rates. Although the relative rate of isomerization of cholesta-8,24-dien-3 beta-ol is six times that observed with cholest-8-en-3 beta-ol, the delta 8 to delta 7 ratio at equilibrium is approximately equal. The reversibility of the reaction has been demonstrated by the direct conversion of cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol to cholest-8-en-3 beta-ol; at equilibrium the delta 7-isomer is predominant (19/1). The purified enzyme does not catalyze isomerization of cholesta-8,14-dien-3 beta-ol and cholest-8(14)-en-3 beta-ol under conditions that result in equilibrium mixtures of isomers from cholest-8(9)-en-3 beta-ol. These results are consistent with the earlier suggestion that delta 8(14)-sterols are neither formed nor metabolized by the same microsomal enzymes that catalyze transformation of lanosterol to cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1504700322,"We have recently purified two proteins, alpha 39 and alpha 41, from bovine cerebral cortex which are substrates for ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin (Neer, E. J., Lok, J. M., and Wolf, L. G. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14222-14229). Both proteins bind guanine nucleotides and interact with beta.gamma units. We have used limited proteolysis by trypsin to probe the structure and the conformational states of these proteins. The guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S)-liganded alpha 41 protein is cleaved into stable 39- and 24/25-kDa products which appear at the same rate. In addition, an 18-kDa peptide is seen. These products are also formed from GDP- or GTP-liganded alpha 41 but are less stable. Cleavage of alpha 39 is different. With GTP gamma S stable 37-kDa product predominates while with GTP or GDP the 37-kDa fragment appears transiently, followed by 24/25-kDa fragments which are stable in the presence of guanine nucleotides but rapidly cleaved without ligand. A 17-kDa peptide is also formed with GTP or GDP. The beta.gamma unit is cleaved by trypsin to stable peptides, a 26/27-kDa doublet and a 14-kDa peptide. Addition of beta.gamma slows tryptic cleavage of alpha 41 but not alpha 39. ADP-ribosylation of alpha 39 and alpha 41 by pertussis toxin affects their conformation in distinct ways which are clearly brought out by the GTP-liganded state. In contrast to unmodified alpha 41, ADP-ribosylated and GTP-liganded alpha 41 is proteolyzed very slowly and without formation of a 39-kDa intermediate. GTP gamma S seems to override the effect of ADP-ribosylation so that cleavage is more rapid and goes via the 39-kDa product. ADP-ribosylation affects alpha 39 more subtly. The GTP-liganded protein is first cleaved to the 37-kDa product and then degraded without forming the 24/25-kDa fragment. These results suggest that ADP-ribosylation might affect the conformation and function of these related proteins differently. The site of [32P]ADP-ribosylation is on the 18-kDa product of alpha 41 and on the 17-kDa product of alpha 39. We have raised polyclonal antibodies against alpha 39 and beta in rabbits and used the antibodies to examine antigenic sites on alpha 39 and beta. The antigenic determinants of alpha 39 are located over most of the native tryptic peptides. Tryptic cleavage of alpha 41 leads to rapid loss of cross-reactivity with anti-alpha 39 antibody.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1539889956,"Four molecules of ribosomal protein L7/L12 are found as two dimers on the Escherichia coli 50 S ribosomal subunit. Immune electron microscopy using monoclonal antibodies directed against two epitopes of protein L7/L12 has allowed placement of elements of each dimer. One monoclonal antibody, directed against a determinant in the COOH-terminal domain, allows localization of two identical determinants at or near the end of the subunit stalk. The same antibody was used to place two additional determinants at the periphery of stalkless subunits, in an area from which a stalk might be expected to project. A second antibody, directed against an epitope in the amino-terminal portion of L7/L12, caused loss of stalks from the 50 S subunits. The micrographs showed symmetrical oligometric complexes of the dissociated dimeric protein with bivalent antibody. Antibodies were also seen to bind to the body of stalkless subunits, in a region near the COOH-terminal sites. The results are explained by a model in which one dimer of protein L7/L12 exists in a folded conformation on the subunit body and the second dimer occurs in an extended conformation in the subunit stalk."
https://openalex.org/W1516910236,"A gene for bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) was fused to the coding sequence for the Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase signal peptide and expressed in E. coli under the control of the alkaline phosphatase promoter. When induced in phosphate-depleted medium such cells produced a trypsin inhibitor that was indistinguishable from native, properly folded BPTI. In particular, the BPTI produced by E. coli had three disulfide bonds that appeared to be identical to those found in native BPTI, as assayed by sensitivity to iodoacetate, dithiothreitol, and urea. This expression/secretion system will make possible the production of variant BPTI molecules, thus allowing the perturbing effects of amino acid substitutions on BPTI folding, structure, and function to be assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2141451386,"Studies were completed in C3-L5178Y cells, in which the DNA-coding region for dihydrofolate reductase messenger RNA (DHFR-mRNA) is amplified, to determine the acute effect of 5-fluorouracil (FUra) on DHFR-mRNA metabolism. There was minimal to no effect of 100 microM FUra on total cytoplasmic DHFR-mRNA levels by 6 and 12 h and only a 25% reduction by 24 h. These results contrasted with the nuclear DHFR-mRNA levels which by 6 h following exposure to FUra increased by 80% in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, some of the increased nuclear DHFR-mRNA was found to be in a non-polyadenylated form. Under conditions to examine only RNA synthesized during the drug exposure, FUra was found to markedly enhance the level of newly synthesized nuclear DHFR-mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, while also producing an apparent dose-dependent reduction in the cytoplasmic DHFR-mRNA. RNA fractionated by 1.5% agarose-urea gel electrophoresis revealed two major cytoplasmic DHFR-mRNA species approximately 1.8 and 0.8 kilobases in size. Following a 24-h FUra exposure, a dose-dependent loss of the 0.8-kilobase DHFR-mRNA was observed. The combined results of these experiments indicate that FUra treatment reduces the ability of nascent DHFR-mRNA to relocate to the cytoplasm, suggesting either an inhibition of mRNA processing or nuclear-cytoplasmic transport."
https://openalex.org/W1544968587,"Homogenate fractions from etiolated pea plantlets showed tyrosine kinase activity when incubated with [32P]ATP and substrates like polyamino acid polymer (Glu-Ala-Tyr)n or [Val5]angiotensin II. When these tyrosine kinase substrates were recovered by high voltage electrophoresis, and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography after alkaline hydrolysis, yielded radioactive phosphotyrosine. The same product was obtained after acid hydrolysis of either endogenous or exogenous substrates. Phosphorylated polypeptides were extracted after sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of a pellet fraction incubated with [32P]ATP. After acid hydrolysis and high voltage electrophoresis, [32P]phosphotyrosine was found in gel bands with polypeptides of about 92 and 57 kDa. These results suggest that tyrosine kinase(s) and phosphotyrosine proteins are also present in higher plants."
https://openalex.org/W1578697993,"The elucidation of the molecular structure of the receptor recognition site of human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) was approached by mapping the epitopes of two monoclonal antibodies (F2B2 and F12A3). These antibodies were shown to be complex-specific, defining neo-antigenic sites not detectable on native alpha 2M and thereby mimicking the specificity of the receptor expressed on macrophages and fibroblasts. The antibodies inhibited binding of alpha 2M-trypsin complexes to the receptor. The epitopes of both monoclonal antibodies are shown here to be located on the Mr 60,000 heat-induced fragment of partially reduced alpha 2M. Limited proteolysis of alpha 2M-methylamine with lysine-specific bacterial endoproteinase was examined by rate electrophoresis and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to correlate the loss of the epitopes with the generation of defined fragments. 14C-Labeled alpha 2M-methylamine was used as an internal marker for the position of the thioesters. Finally, the epitopes were protected toward proteolysis by subjecting immune complexes of alpha 2M-methylamine with the monoclonal antibodies to proteolysis under the same conditions as uncomplexed alpha 2M-methylamine. The results obtained allowed us to map the epitopes of both the monoclonal antibodies to within a distance of about Mr 20,000 from the COOH-terminal end of human alpha 2M."
https://openalex.org/W1505920494,"Abstract To compare surface sarcolemmal with T-tubular distributions of [3H]saxitoxin (STX)- and [3H]nitrendipine (NTD)-binding sites, we centrifuged membrane vesicles from sheep and bovine ventricles on a 10-40% linear sucrose gradient from which fractions were assayed for STX and NTD binding; for markers of surface sarcolemma (ouabain-sensitive Na,K-ATPase activity, [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding); and for markers of junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum known to be preferentially associated with T-tubules (ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ uptake, calsequestrin, an Mr 300,000 putative phosphorylatable foot protein, and electron microscopically visible junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum-plasmalemma complexes). We identified three distinct peaks in the sucrose gradient, each characterized by significant high and low affinity STX- and high affinity NTD-binding: Peak I (approximately 19% sucrose), highly enriched in surface sarcolemma; Peak III (approximately 36% sucrose), enriched in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum markers and hence in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum complexes with T-tubule; and Peak II (approximately 27% sucrose), showing greatest specific STX binding and only moderate NTD binding, enriched in T-tubular membrane, unassociated with junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum. For ventricular myocytes, the ratio NTD sites/STX sites was 2.5 for surface sarcolemma, but only approximately 1.0 for T-tubules. Unlike data published for mammalian skeletal muscle, sheep and beef cardiac NTD receptors were not significantly more concentrated in T-tubular than in surface plasmalemma."
https://openalex.org/W1508938756,"Abstract Regulation of epithelial Na+ channels was investigated by measuring the amiloride-blockable 22Na+ fluxes in apical membrane vesicles, derived from cells exposed to various treatments. Maximal amiloride-blockable 22Na+ uptake into vesicles was obtained if the cells were preincubated at 25 degrees C in a Ca2+-free [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA) solution. Including 10(-5) M Ca2+ in the cell incubating medium blocked nearly all of the amiloride-sensitive flux in vesicles, even though the Ca2+ was removed before homogenization of the cells. This Ca2+-dependent inhibition of Na+ channels could be induced in whole cells only; incubating cell homogenates with Ca2+ had no effect on the transport in vesicles. The dose-response relationships of this effect were measured by equilibrating cell aliquots with various Ca2+-EGTA buffers, preparing membrane vesicles (in the absence of Ca2+ ions), and assaying them for amiloride-sensitive Na+ permeability. It was found that the Ca2+ blockage is highly cooperative (Hill coefficient of nearly 4) and is characterized by an inhibition constant which varies between 6.4 X 10(-8) to 8.15 X 10(-6)M Ca2+. Thus, it is likely that the above process is involved in the physiological control of Na+ transport. The Ca2+-dependent transport changes were not affected by the calmodulin inhibitor trifluoperasine, vanadate (VO3-), phorbol ester, colchicine, cytochalasin B, 3-deazaadenosine, and 8-bromo-cAMP. Vanadyl (VO2+) ions, on the other hand, produced a Ca2+-like inhibition of transport."
https://openalex.org/W1532234837,"We have incorporated the myosin fragment heavy meromyosin (HMM), which is known to interact mechanochemically and enzymatically with actin filaments, into intact chromaffin cells of the bovine adrenal medulla, in order to study the possible involvement of actin and myosin in stimulus-secretion coupling. HMM was found to stimulate secretion of catecholamines, to cause depolarization of the plasma membrane, and to enhance 22Na+ uptake. HMM-stimulated catecholamine secretion was dependent on the presence of extracellular Na+. The Na+ uptake caused by HMM was inhibited by 10 microM amiloride. Acetylcholine-stimulated catecholamine secretion and 22Na+ uptake were both enhanced by HMM incorporation. A Na+/H+ antiporter, activated by the interaction of HMM with the cells' microfilaments, seems to be involved in HMM action and could possibly also be a component of stimulus-secretion coupling in chromaffin cells, induced by regular agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1557451824,"Two monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes in Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L7/L12 were prepared and characterized as reported previously (Sommer, A., Etchison, J.R., Gavino, G., Zecherle, N., Casiano, C., and Traud, R.R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6522-6527). Both antibodies strongly inhibited polyuridylic acid-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis, ribosome-dependent GTPase activity, and the binding of elongation factor G to the ribosome at mole ratios over ribosomes of 4:1 or less. One epitope was shown to be within residues 1-73 (Ab 1-73) and the other within 74-120 (Ab 74-120). Incubation of 50 S ribosomal subunits or 70 S ribosomes with Ab 1-73, but not with Ab 74-120, leads to a partial loss of L7/L12 from the particle with no loss of any other protein. The experiment was repeated with ribosomes reconstituted with pure radioactive L7/L12 of determined specific activity in order to quantify the L7/L12 in the antibody-treated particle. The protein-deficient core particles isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation after incubation with Ab 1-73 were found to contain, on average, two copies of L7/L12 and one Ab 1-73. The constancy of this stoichiometry in many experiments and the demonstration of Ab 1-73 on all particles indicate the presence of a homogeneous population of ribosomes, each with only one of the two L7/L12 dimers originally present. The results show a difference in the interactions of the two dimers with the ribosome and present a means of preparing ribosomes with one dimer in a specific binding site. The accompanying paper (Olson, H.M., Sommer, A., Tewari, D. S., Traut, R.R., and Glitz, D.G. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 6924-6932) shows by immune electron microscopy the location of the two antibody-binding sites and the effect of Ab 1-73 on structure."
https://openalex.org/W1569600518,"Translational control RNA (tcRNA102) is closely associated with nonpolysomal myosin heavy chain-mRNA in mRNP particles. The nucleotide sequence of tcRNA102 has revealed a heterogeneity at the 3' end. This heterogeneity is mostly with regard to an ambiguity between adenine and guanine residues. tcRNA102 (obtained from pectoralis muscle) runs as a single band on denaturing acrylamide gels. When this band is extracted and rerun on a native gel at low voltage, two individual bands appear (A the slower moving and the faster moving). From the partial RNase U2 sequence analysis and our previous sequence determinations (McCarthy, T. L., Siegel, E., Mrockowski, B., and Heywood, S. M. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 935-941), we may now assign tcRNA102 (A) the 3'-terminal sequence ... GGUUGGACGG-3' and tcRNA102(B) and 3' terminal sequence ... GAUUAAGCAA-3'. Analysis of the tcRNA102s indicates that dystrophic pectoralis muscle contains much less tcRNA102 than a similar preparation from control muscle. The tcRNA102 found in dystrophic pectoralis muscle is of the A type while normal pectoralis muscle contains predominantly the B type. In addition, control leg muscle from dystrophic chick contains predominantly B type. These results suggest that the differences observed at the DNA level (see accompanying paper, Zezza, D. J., and Heywood, S. M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7455-7460) may be reflected in the RNA transcripts."
