https://openalex.org/W1981554467,"This article primarily reviews recent work on ultrafast experiments on excited state intramolecular electron and proton transfer, with an emphasis on experiments on chemical systems that have been analyzed theoretically. In particular, those systems that have been quantitatively characterized by static spectroscopy, which provides detailed information about the reaction potential energy surface and about other parameters that are necessary to make a direct comparison to theoretical predictions, are described."
https://openalex.org/W1968945335,"A paleotemperature record based on measurements of atmospheric noble gases dissolved in ground water of the Carrizo aquifer (Texas) shows that the annual mean temperature in the southwestern United States during the last glacial maximum was about 5°C lower than the present-day value. In combination with evidence for fluctuations in mountain snow lines, this cooling indicates that the glacial lapse rate was approximately the same as it is today. In contrast, measurements on deep-sea sediments indicate that surface temperatures in the ocean basins adjacent to our study area decreased by only about 2°C. This difference between continental and oceanic records poses questions concerning our current understanding of paleoclimate and climate-controlling processes."
https://openalex.org/W1990030143,A model of the desorption and adsorption of a polymer layer at a planar surface indicates a transition from exponential kinetics at high temperatures to nonexponential kinetics (stretched exponential with index one-half) at lower temperatures where these processes are diffusion-limited. Measurements of polystyrene desorption through polyisoprene overlayers show this predicted transition. Corroborative results are obtained for polystyrene desorption through polymethylmethacrylate overlayers. This identification of two distinct kinetic regimes suggests a unifying perspective from which to analyze polymer and biopolymer mobility at surfaces.
https://openalex.org/W2045478789,"Airborne studies of smoke from the Kuwait oil fires were carried out in the spring of 1991 when approximately 4.6 million barrels of oil were burning per day. Emissions of sulfur dioxide were approximately 57% of that from electric utilities in the United States; emissions of carbon dioxide were approximately 2% of global emissions; emissions of soot were approximately 3400 metric tons per day. The smoke absorbed approximately 75 to 80% of the sun's radiation in regions of the Persian Gulf. However, the smoke probably had insignificant global effects because (i) particle emissions were less than expected, (ii) the smoke was not as black as expected, (iii) the smoke was not carried high in the atmosphere, and (iv) the smoke had a short atmospheric residence time."
https://openalex.org/W2063035703,"Helium-3/helium-4 ratios in submarine basalt glasses from the Galapagos Archipelago range up to 23 times the atmospheric ratio in the west and southwest. These results indicate the presence of a relatively undegassed mantle plume at the Galápagos hot spot and place Galápagos alongside Hawaii, Iceland, and Samoa as the only localities known to have such high helium-3/helium-4 ratios. Lower ratios across the rest of the Galápagos Archipelago reflect systematic variations in the degree of dilution of the plume by entrainment of depleted material from the asthenosphere. These spatial variations reveal the dynamics of the underlying mantle plume and its interaction with the nearby Galápagos Spreading Center."
https://openalex.org/W1998163182,"Projections to the middle of the next century indicate that unabated historical global energy trends would lead to an annual global energy demand about four times present levels, primarily due to population and economic growth. But extensive global conservation and energy-efficient systems might reduce this value by half. The cumulative effect of the coming half century's use may strain the world's low-cost resources, particularly oil. The future fuel mix is further complicated by the environmental thrust to reduce the global use of carbon-based fuels. The interaction of the principal factors influencing future energy resource and technology options are projected."
https://openalex.org/W2149324757,"Paleowaters from the Floridan aquifer system in the southeastern Atlantic coastal plain have higher D/H and (18)O/(16)O ratios than local Holocene ground water. Maximum delta(18)O enrichments in ground water having adjusted radiocarbon ages of 20,000 to 26,000 years are 0.7 to 2.3 per mil. The trend in isotopic enrichment in paleowaters is the reverse of that normally observed in continental glacial age ground water. Dissolved nitrogen and argon concentrations indicate, however, that the average recharge temperature was 5.3 degrees C cooler than that today. The data indicate cool conditions in the southeast Atlantic coastal plain during the last glacial maximum, with recharge limited primarily to late summer tropical cyclones and hurricanes."
https://openalex.org/W2009721863,"Three deep boreholes in a small area in Quebec, each having two high-accuracy temperature logs separated by 22 years, allow reliable determination of the ground surface temperature history during the past few centuries. The temperature logs show that the recent climatic warming was preceded by a cold period near the end of the 19th century in this area. The presence of such a cold period is also suggested by borehole temperature data from other areas in Canada."
https://openalex.org/W2007794110,"Histological and ultrastructural evaluation of the ends of long bones of juvenile dinosaurs from the Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation of Montana revealed the preservation of growth plates. Growth plates are discs of cartilage present near the ends of growing long bones that generate bone elongation. Comparison of the fossils with modern taxa demonstrated homology of the growth plate in birds and dinosaurs. The presence of an avian-type growth plate in dinosaurs adds a shared derived anatomical character corroborating inclusion of birds within the Dinosauria. Additionally, possession of a growth plate, which in birds is capable of producing rapid determinate long bone growth, implies that an avian developmental pattern may have been present in these dinosaurs."
https://openalex.org/W2014023267,"Publisher Summary Magnetoresistance (MR) is the change in electrical resistance of a material in response to a magnetic field. All metals have an inherent, albeit small, MR owing to the Lorentz force that a magnetic field exerts on moving electrons. Although earlier studies reported unusual magnetoresistive effects in layered structures, it was discovered that the application of magnetic fields to atomically engineered materials known as magnetic superlattices greatly reduced their electrical resistance, that is, superlattices had a giant magnetoresistance. Superlattices are a special form of multilayered structures, artificially grown under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions by alternately depositing on a substrate several atomic layers of one element, say, iron, followed by layers of another, such as chromium. The original observation of giant magnetoresistance was made on iron–chromium superlattices with nearly perfect crystallinity, which was grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Giant magnetoresistance observed in layered and granular structures arises from the dependence of the resistivity on their internal (local) magnetic configuration."
https://openalex.org/W2071860341,"A nonmechanical approach to the construction of complex three-dimensional interconnect arrays has been developed with the use of conducting polymer dendrites. Electrically independent connections between pairs of wires in an array were successfully grown through alternating-current electrochemical polymerization of poly(3-methylthiophene), without mechanical or optical masking steps. The electrically active links were insulated by subsequent electropolymerization of 4-vinylpyridine or 2-methylthiophene or by the dip-coating of the connections in a polystyrene solution."
https://openalex.org/W2009020882,"Light emission from molecular layers has been induced by inelastically tunneling electrons in a tunneling junction. The fast quenching of molecular emission on metal surfaces was suppressed by use of the ""transparent conductor"" indium-tin-oxide for the junction electrodes. The emission measurements have been made in squeezable tunneling junctions as small as 10(-9) square centimeters, coated with 9-10 dichloro-anthracene layers. At a bias of 2.5 to 3.5 volts, yields of 5000 photons per microcoulomb were observed. Evidence for the molecular origin of the emission is given. This method shows good prospects for use in the imaging of chromophores on surfaces with atomic resolution."

https://openalex.org/W4233246189,"In the 24 April ""Inside AAAS"" article ""AAAS organizes more meetings of the mind"" (p. 548), it is stated incorrectly that Paul Berg of Stanford University will be giving the keynote address and that Helen Donis-Keller of Washington University will be presenting a paper at the Science Innovation '92 meeting in San Francisco (21 to 25 July 1992). The Science Innovation '92 program was tentative at the time the article was written. Joseph Martin of the University of California, San Francisco, will deliver the keynote address on one of the major themes of the meeting, ""Mapping the Human Brain."" Helen Donis-Keller and Paul Berg were invited to speak but will not be on the program this year."
