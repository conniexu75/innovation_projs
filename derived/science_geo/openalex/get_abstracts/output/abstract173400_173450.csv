https://openalex.org/W2157815289,"A single nicotine exposure increases dopamine levels in the mesolimbic reward system for hours, but nicotine concentrations experienced by smokers desensitize nAChRs on dopamine neurons in seconds to minutes. Here, we show that persistent modulation of both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission by nicotine can contribute to the sustained increase in dopamine neuron excitability. Nicotine enhances GABAergic transmission transiently, which is followed by a persistent depression of these inhibitory inputs due to nAChR desensitization. Simultaneously, nicotine enhances glutamatergic transmission through nAChRs that desensitize less than those on GABA neurons. The net effect is a shift toward excitation of the dopamine reward system. These results suggest that spatial and temporal differences in nicotinic receptor activity on both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in reward areas coordinate to reinforce nicotine self-administration."

https://openalex.org/W1996592124,"Previous work suggests N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation may be involved in degeneration of medium-sized spiny striatal neurons in Huntington's disease (HD). Here we show that these neurons are more vulnerable to NMDAR-mediated death in a YAC transgenic FVB/N mouse model of HD expressing full-length mutant huntingtin, compared with wild-type FVB/N mice. Excitotoxic death of these neurons was increased after intrastriatal injection of quinolinate in vivo, and after NMDA but not AMPA exposure in culture. NMDA-induced cell death was abolished by an NR2B subtype-specific antagonist. In contrast, NMDAR-mediated death of cerebellar granule neurons was not enhanced, consistent with cell-type and NMDAR subtype specificity. Moreover, increased NMDA-evoked current amplitude and caspase-3 activity were observed in transgenic striatal neurons. Our data support a role for NR2B-subtype NMDAR activation as a trigger for selective neuronal degeneration in HD."
https://openalex.org/W2067857310,"Although fluorine in the form of fluoride minerals is the most abundant halogen in the Earth's crust, only 12 naturally occurring organofluorine compounds have so far been found, and how these are biosynthesized remains a mystery. Here we describe an enzymatic reaction that occurs in the bacterium Streptomyces cattleya and which catalyses the conversion of fluoride ion and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to 5'-fluoro-5'-deoxyfluoroadenosine (5'-FDA). To our knowledge, this is the first fluorinase enzyme to be identified, a discovery that opens up a new biotechnological opportunity for the preparation of organofluorine compounds."

We have previously demonstrated its implication in the up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene transcription following growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells, a situation where p42/p44 mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) activity is dramatically increased. Here we show that p42/p44 MAPK directly phosphorylates Sp1 on threonines 453 and 739 both in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of these sites to alanines decreases by half the MAPK-dependent transcriptional activity of Sp1, in the context of the VEGF promoter, in SL2 Drosophila cells devoid of the endogenous Sp1 protein. Moreover, inducible overexpression of the (T453A,T739A) Sp1 double mutant compromises MAPK-driven VEGF mRNA transcription in fibroblasts. These results highlight Sp1 as a key molecular link between elevated activation of the Ras ≫ p42/p44MAPK signaling pathway and increased VEGF expression, two major steps deregulated in tumor cells.

Interestingly, the low tension of oxygen (hypoxia), which occurs in the core of solid tumors, induces VEGF expression by modulating all three levels of regulation cited above (2Finkenzeller G.

We have recently shown that the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway plays a critical role in the transcription of VEGF gene following Ras transformation and growth factor stimulation. For this first study we used a cell line derived from CCL39 fibroblasts in which rapid and exclusive activation of MAPK can be achieved in response to estradiol (19Samuels M.L. Weber J.M. McMahon M.

In these cells, activation of the MAPK pathway is sufficient to induce VEGF transcription (22Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway via activation of protein kinase C ζ is also highly important in human fibrosarcoma and renal cell carcinoma for driving VEGF transcription (23Pal S.

In both cases, the main transcription factor implicated in the regulation of VEGF transcription following Ras activation is Sp1 (8Pal S. Claffey K.P. Cohen H.T. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol.

It plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of genes, and its knock out in mice results in embryonic lethality (27Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Originally described as a cellular transcription factor required for SV40 gene expression, Sp1 was shown to stimulate transcription through binding to GC-rich boxes present on a wide variety of promoters. Sp1 is a highly glycosylated and phosphorylated protein (28Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Several kinases have been shown to phosphorylate Sp1, including DNA-dependent protein kinase (29Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), casein kinase II (30Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol.

The level of Sp1 phosphorylation is also regulated during cell cycle progression (33Jensen D.E. Black A.R. Swick A.G. Azizkhan J.C. J. Cell.

MAPK are activated by a wide variety of stimuli and particularly by growth and differentiation factors. These serine/threonine kinases are cytoplasmic in quiescent cells, but once activated they translocate to the nucleus (36Gonzalez F.A. Seth A. Raden D.L. Bowman D.S. Fay F.S. Davis R.J. J.

An important role in the control of gene expression has been attributed to MAPK, because many of their nuclear targets are transcription factors, such as Elk-1 (46Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), which is directly activated, c-Fos, which is stabilized (47Okazaki K. Sagata N.

Concomitantly, VEGF is overexpressed in many tumors and contributes to their neovascularization (55Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). In a previous study we have identified a short region of the VEGF promoter, which is targeted by the p42/p44 MAPK. This region containing two Sp1 sites actually binds the transcription factor (22Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Another study showed that recombinant active p42 MAPK enhances DNA binding capacity of Sp1 in vitro (56Merchant J.L., Du, M. Todisco A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to test the hypothesis that Sp1 is a link between the MAPK pathway and VEGF expression. First we observed that MAPK stimulation rapidly enhanced DNA binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to the VEGF promoter. By using in vitro kinase assays as well as antibodies directed against phosphopeptides we identified two major sites targeted by p42/p44 MAPK on Sp1. Both sites are indispensable for Sp1 activity following activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. Thereafter, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of Sp1 by p42/p44 MAPK is a crucial event for the regulation of at least VEGF, one of the key genes implicated in neovascularization. Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were obtained from New England BioLabs or from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]dATP were from ICN. Synthetic oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec. Recombinant human proteins Sp1 and AP-2 were purchased from Promega. Recombinant active p42 MAPK/ERK2 was purchased from New England BioLabs. Anti-Myc antibody (9E10) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-Sp1 (PEP-2) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. ΔRaf:ER cells are a derivative of CCL39 fibroblasts that stably expressed a fusion protein comprised of the catalytic domain of Raf-1 and the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (19Samuels M.L.

These cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) without phenol red containing 7.5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (50 μg/ml), and G418 (400 μg/ml). Growth-arrested cells were obtained by total deprivation of serum for 48 h. Cells expressing a tetracycline-inducible vector were cultivated in the same medium supplemented with blasticidin (7.5 μg/ml, selection of the tetracycline repressor) and zeocin (500 μg/ml, selection of the gene of interest). Induction of the transgene was obtained by stimulating the cells for 24–48 h with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. The Drosophila melanogaster Schneider (SL2) cells were grown in DES medium (Invitrogen) withl-glutamine supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. ΔRaf:ER cells (106 cells/10-cm diameter dish) were transfected by CaPO4 precipitation technique with 15 μg of the different pcDNA4/TO vectors. SL2 cells were transiently transfected as described above (see luciferase assays). All the plasmids coding for the different subdomains of Sp1 fused to GST were a generous gift of Dr. J. Horowitz excepted the GST-D, which was obtained by PCR using the following oligonucleotides on the GST-Zn matrix: forward, 5′-CGGGATCCCGGCACTGCCACTCCTTCAGCC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGAATTCCTAGTTGGCAAGACGGGCAATGC-3′ (57Murata Y.

The full-length Sp1 cDNA excised from the pGEX vector was introduced in the pCMVTag vector within EcoRI/BamHI sites. We then excised a NotI/XhoI fragment of this vector and introduced it in the pcDNA4/TO vector (Invitrogen). The different point mutations of the MAPK consensus phosphorylation sites were obtained using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit supplied by Stratagene. The vector containing the VEGF promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene has already been described (22Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol.

Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in the “RNA Insta-Pure” buffer from Eurogentec. The supernatant was cleared by centrifugation, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in sterile water. Ten micrograms of RNA was used for Northern analysis and analyzed as previously described (22Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol.

SL2 Drosophila cells in 12-well dishes (105/well) were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate technique. 3.5 μg of reporter plasmid (−88/+54 of the VEGF promoter in pGL2 basic vector) was co-transfected with 0.5 μg of Myc-Sp1-HA (wt or mutants), in the absence or presence of 1 μg of MEKSD/SE-MAPK. 1.5 μg of pPAC plasmid coding for the LacZ gene under control of the Drosophila actin promoter was also added as a control of transfection efficiency. Salmon sperm DNA was added to reach a final amount of 13 μg. Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were washed once in DES medium and incubated in DES medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Four days after transfection, cells were washed in PBS, and luciferase assays were performed as previously described (22Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol.

Nuclear extracts, electromobility shift assays (EMSA), and supershift assays were performed, as previously described (22Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol.

The probe used in these experiments was synthesized to span the region of the human VEGF promoter comprised between the −88 and −66 bp: 5′-TTTCCGGGGCGGGCCGGGGGCGGGG TAT-3′ (random sequences added to the wild type sequence are shown in italic letters). Anti-phosphopeptide sera were generated by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France) by injecting two rabbits each with the following phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptide 1 (Phospho Thr739): NH2-KRRSEGSTA-(PO3H2)-T PSAlI-COOH coupled to KLH. Phosphopeptide2 (Phospho Thr453): NH2-KSGPIIIR-(PO3H2)-T PTVGPNG-COOH (where the boldface “T” represents the threonines targeted by MAPK), coupled to ovalbumin (GenBankTM accession numbers: AB039286 and J03133). Sera were affinity-purified by passing them first over an EAH-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to which the unphosphorylated peptide was coupled and the flow-through was collected. The non-retained fraction was then passed over a column to which the phosphorylated peptide was bound. Specific IgG were then eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.8) and neutralized in Tris 3 m, pH 11. ΔRaf:ER cells were plated on glass coverslips at a density of 105 cells/35-mm dish. The cells were rendered quiescent by incubation in serum-free medium for 24 h and stimulated or not with estradiol 1 μm. Cells were then fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C, followed by methanol permeabilization for 15 min at −20 °C. Coverslips were washed with PBS, and the nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.2% gelatin. Coverslips were incubated with the first antibody diluted in PBS/BSA/gelatin (anti-phospho-Thr453, 1/120; anti-Myc, 1/1000) for 1 h, then washed five time with PBS. Prior to the incubation with the second antibody (biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, 1/1000 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse, 1/100), 4′,6-diamidine dihydrochloride (Roche) was added at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml during the last 15 min of incubation to enumerate cells. After extensive washes in PBS and in distilled water, coverslips were mounted in Citifluor and examined under epifluorescence illumination. They were performed in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmpara-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) with ∼5 μg of the different GST/Sp1 fusion proteins or equimolar amounts of Sp1 (0.6 μg), AP-2 (0.3 μg), BSA (0.4 μg), myelin basic protein (0.12 μg), GST-ATF2 (0.4 μg), GST-Elk1 (0.3 μg), and GST-Jun (0.4 μg) as substrates and 5 μCi of 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on SDS-PAGE. ΔRaf:ER cells or ΔRaf:ER cells stably transfected with the tetracycline inducible vectors were serum-deprived for 48 h. After estradiol or serum stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and immediately lysed in Laemmli sample buffer. Eighty micrograms of protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon). The membranes were incubated with purified anti-phospho-Thr739 antibody (1/1000) or anti-phospho-MAPK (1/5000) or anti-total Sp1 (PEP2 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1/2000). The protein was labeled with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). We have previously shown that long term activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway results in increased VEGF transcription. This effect was found to be directly dependent on the recruitment of Sp1 and AP-2 transcription factors to a GC-rich region located on the proximal region of the VEGF promoter (−88/−66) (22Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To determine whether this effect of p42/p44MAPK on the DNA binding activity of these transcription factors is direct, we performed EMSA experiments with nuclear extracts of cells expressing an estradiol-inducible Raf-1 (ΔRaf-1:ER) (19Samuels M.L. Weber J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 20Samuels M.L. McMahon M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 14: 7855-7866Crossref Google Scholar). In these cells, p42/p44 MAPK activity is rapidly and exclusively activated by estradiol (21Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). ΔRaf-1:ER cells were serum-deprived for 48 h and then stimulated by the addition of estradiol. When incubated with nuclear extracts of untreated ΔRaf-1:ER cells, a basal DNA binding activity on a double-stranded probe encompassing the −88/−66-bp region of the human VEGF promoter was detected (Fig. 1A, lane 1). In nuclear extracts of cells stimulated with estradiol for 15 min (Fig. 1A, lane 3) or 3 h (Fig. 1A, lane 5), an increase DNA binding activity was observed. Both basal and the stimulated complexes, in extracts of estradiol-stimulated cells for 15 min (Fig. 1A, lane 4) or 3 h (Fig. 1A, lane 6), were almost entirely disrupted in the presence of an excess of unlabeled double-stranded Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide, demonstrating that these complexes contain Sp1 or Sp1-related proteins. However, when extracts of cells stimulated with estradiol for 3 h (Fig. 1A, lane 6) were used, one part of complex B resists competition with unlabeled Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide. One part of this complex can be attributed to the presence of the AP-2 transcription factor, which is recruited to the VEGF promoter after long term p42/p44 MAPK stimulation as previously described (22Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouysségur J. Pagès G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the presence of Sp1 in the different complexes observed with extracts of estradiol-stimulated ΔRaf-1:ER cells for 15 min, we performed supershift experiments with anti-Sp1 antibody. Our results clearly demonstrate that Sp1 (present at least in complexes B1 and B2) is recruited to the VEGF promoter following a short term stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK by estradiol (Fig. 1B). Supershift experiments with anti-Sp3 antibody also show that Sp3 is recruited to the VEGF promoter following a short term stimulation with estradiol and is contained within complex B3 and c (data not shown). Band shift as well as supershift experiments were also performed with nuclear extracts of estradiol-stimulated cells in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. The same results were also obtained in such conditions (data not shown). Because this effect occurred rapidly and in conditions where protein neo-synthesis is blocked, we postulated that it could be accounted for by direct phosphorylation of the transcription factors. We have then investigated whether Sp1 could be directly phosphorylated by p42/p44 MAPK. Thus, we performed in vitro kinase assays using equivalent molar amounts of affinity-purified Sp1, AP-2, bovine serum albumin (BSA), GST-ATF2, GST-Jun, GST-Elk1, and myelin basic protein. GST-ATF2, a specific substrate for the SAPK/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38/HOG MAPK (60Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2140529908,"Binding of ouabain to Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activates tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Src, and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in both cardiac myocytes and A7r5 cells. Here, we explored the roles of Src and the EGFR in the ouabain-invoked pathways that lead to the activation of MAPKs. Exposure of A7r5 and LLC-PK1 cells to ouabain caused a dose-dependent inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity, which correlated well with ouabain-induced activation of Src and MAPKs in these cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that ouabain stimulated Src binding to Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in a dose- and time-dependent manner and increased phosphorylation of Src at Tyr(418) but had no effect on Tyr(529) phosphorylation. Ouabain failed to activate MAPKs in A7r5 cells that were pretreated with the Src inhibitor PP2 and in SYF cells in which Src family kinases are knocked out. Preincubation with AG1478, but not AG1295, also blocked the effects of ouabain on p42/44 MAPKs in A7r5 cells. Significantly, both herbimycin A and PP2 abrogated ouabain-induced but not epidermal growth factor-induced Src binding to the EGFR and the subsequent EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Ouabain also failed to affect tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR in SYF cells. In addition, unlike epidermal growth factor, ouabain did not increase EGFR autophosphorylation at Tyr(1173). These findings clearly indicate that ouabain transactivates the EGFR by activation of Src and stimulation of Src binding to the EGFR. Furthermore, we found that the transactivated EGFR was capable of recruiting and phosphorylating the adaptor protein Shc. This resulted in increased binding of another adaptor protein Grb2 to the Src-EGFR complex and the subsequent activation of Ras and MAPKs. Taken together, these new findings suggest that Src mediates the inter-receptor cross-talk between Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and the EGFR to transduce the signals from ouabain to the Ras/MAPK cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2074701223,"The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP) is a multifunctional cell surface receptor that interacts through its cytoplasmic tail with adaptor and scaffold proteins that participate in cellular signaling. Its extracellular domain, like that of the signaling receptor Notch and of amyloid precursor protein (APP), is proteolytically processed at multiple positions. This similarity led us to investigate whether LRP, like APP and Notch, might also be cleaved at a third, intramembranous or cytoplasmic site, resulting in the release of its intracellular domain. Using independent experimental approaches we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain is released by a γ-secretase-like activity and that this event is modulated by protein kinase C. Furthermore, cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that bind to the LRP tail affect the subcellular localization of the free intracellular domain and may regulate putative signaling functions. Finally, we show that the degradation of the free tail fragment is mediated by the proteasome.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 571-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although the members of this evolutionarily ancient gene family all share the same typical arrangement of protein modules in their extracellular domains, the biological functions of the individual members of the family are highly diverse and include roles in cellular ligand uptake and endocytosis, the transmission of extracellular signals, vitamin and cholesterol homeostasis, brain development, the modulation of neurotransmission, and protection from neurodegeneration (1Herz J.

Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Ligands that bind to its extracellular domain include, for instance, α2-macroglobulin, plasminogen activators, clotting factors, lipases, and the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The cytoplasmic tail of LRP also interacts with an extended set of intracellular adaptor and scaffold proteins, e.g. Dab1, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase interacting proteins, the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 (4Gotthardt M.

The latter protein contains two phosphotyrosine binding domains, of which the first binds to the LRP tail, whereas the second domain interacts with an NP XY motif in the cytoplasmic tail of APP (6Fiore F.

Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the few malformed LRP-deficient embryos that survive until around E9–E10 is complex and difficult to explain by defects in ligand endocytosis alone, suggesting that LRP, like the VLDL receptor and the apo-ER2 (11Trommsdorff M.

However, only LRP and its closest relative, LRP1b, are cleaved at a site that matches the consensus sequence recognized by furin (12Willnow T.E. Moehring J.M. Inocencio N.M. Moehring T.J. Herz J.

Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Furin cleavage of the 600-kDa LRP precursor protein produces the mature cell-surface receptor, which consists of a carboxyl-terminal 85-kDa fragment and a non-covalently attached 515-kDa amino-terminal subunit.Notably, furin also cleaves members of the Notch family of cell surface signaling proteins, which, like LRP, contain multiple EGF repeats in their extracellular domain (15Blaumueller C.M., Qi, H.

Additionally, Notch proteins undergo another metalloproteinase-mediated processing step at the cell surface (17Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A.

Notch-ICD translocates to the nucleus where it stimulates expression of target genes through interaction with transcription factors of the CSL family (21Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4856) Google Scholar).Interestingly, shedding of LRP from the cell surface has also been reported (22Quinn K.A. Grimsley P.G. Dai Y.P. Tapner M. Chesterman C.N. Owensby D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23946-23951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and it, too, involves a metalloproteinase (23Quinn K.A. Pye V.J. Dai Y.P. Chesterman C.N. Owensby D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LRP can form a complex with APP by interactions of both the extracellular (24Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8354-8361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). APP also undergoes several proteolytic processing events that, as in Notch, lead to the presenilin/γ-secretase-dependent release of the cytoplasmic tail. Recently it was shown that FE65 binding to the APP tail not only greatly enhances nuclear translocation of the complex but that this also serves to recruit transcriptional activators, which could potentially stimulate the expression of target genes that are regulated by APP cleavage events (26Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar).The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether LRP, in a manner analogous to Notch and APP, may also be subject to intramembranous or cytoplasmic proteolytic processing that results in the release of its intracellular domain from the membrane. Our results demonstrate that such a cleavage event occurs, that a protease with γ-secretase like properties is involved, and that intracellular proteins such as FE65 under certain conditions can stimulate the translocation of the tail fragment into the nucleus. The amount of biologically active cleaved tail fragment can be regulated by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters and by inhibition of the proteasome.RESULTSThe γ-secretase-mediated intramembranous cleavage events that in Notch and APP lead to the release of the proteins' intracellular domains into the cytoplasm occur at a site preceding a valine located four or three residues, respectively, from the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (32Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The transmembrane segment of LRP contains two valine residues at a corresponding position (Fig. 1) raising the possibility that LRP might be cleaved at the same relative position and that this cleavage might also involve γ-secretase.To test whether the cytoplasmic tail of LRP can be released by intramembranous or intracellular proteolysis, we constructed an expression vector encoding a chimeric protein, in which a yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain and a VP16 transactivation domain from herpes simplex virus were fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of the cytoplasmic tail of full-length LRP (pLRP-Gal4/VP16; Fig. 2 A). Proteolytic release of the tail-Gal4/VP16 fusion protein from the membrane was detected by measuring Gal4/VP16-dependent luciferase gene expression from a reporter construct containing multiple Gal4 binding motifs and the adenoviral E1B minimal promoter, followed by the luciferase gene (pG5E1B-Luc). A similar experimental strategy had previously been employed to detect the release of Notch ICD and for identifying the carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP as part of a transcriptionally active complex (19Lecourtois M.

Transcriptional stimulation by a soluble Gal4/VP16 fusion protein or by an LDL receptor-Gal4/VP16 (LDLR-Gal4/VP16) chimeric protein, which is not expected to undergo processing, served as positive and negative controls, respectively. LRP-Gal4/VP16 stimulated luciferase activity by ∼80 fold, whereas LDLR-Gal4/VP16 had no effect (Fig. 2 B), even though expression of the shorter LDLR-Gal4/VP16 fusion protein was considerably higher than that of the almost five times larger LRP-Gal4/VP16 construct (data not shown). These findings indicate that the cytoplasmic tail of LRP can be proteolytically released from the membrane.Reporter Gene Activity in LRP-Gal4/VP16-expressing Cells Is Enhanced by PMA TreatmentWe next sought to determine, whether the rate at which the cytoplasmic tail of LRP is released from the membrane can be modulated.

However, incubation of the transfected cells with the phorbol ester PMA robustly increased reporter gene activity from the LRP-Gal4/VP16 construct by ∼8 fold but not from the APP-Gal4/VP16 or LDLR-Gal4/VP16 control constructs (Fig. 3 A).Figure 3PKC-mediated stimulation of LRP-Gal4/VP16 dependent reporter gene activity. A, LRP-Gal4/VP16-induced reporter gene activity is enhanced by PMA. 293 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of pG5E1B-Luc, 0.05 μg of pCMV-β-Gal, and 1 μg of pcDNA3.1-LRP-Gal4/VP16 (expression plasmid for LRP-Gal4/VP16), pMstGV-APP (APP-Gal4/VP16), or pMstGV-LDLR (LDLR-Gal4/VP16), respectively. After 24 h the cells were stimulated in the absence or presence of 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 24 h. Luciferase reporter gene activity was corrected for transfection efficiency as described above. B, PMA-dependent stimulation of reporter activity is blocked by Calphostin C. 293 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of pG5E1B-Luc, 0.05 μg of pCMV-β-Gal, and 1 μg of pcDNA3.1-LRP-Gal4/VP16. After 24 h the cells were treated with 100 nm PMA, 1 μm Calphostin, or with both for 24 h. Luciferase reporter gene activity was determined as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because phorbol esters are activators of PKC, we determined whether the stimulatory effect of PMA could be blocked by simultaneous treatment of cells with Calphostin C, a non-isozyme-specific PKC inhibitor. Incubation of PMA-treated LRP-Gal4/VP16-transfected cells with 1 μm Calphostin C completely abolished the PMA-mediated increase in reporter gene activity (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that PKC can regulate LRP tail release.The cytoplasmic tail of LRP contains a possible PKC phosphorylation site as part of the NPTYK sequence motif. To test whether this PKC phosphorylation site was directly involved in the regulation of tail release, nuclear import, or stimulation of reporter gene transcription, we mutated the putatively phosphorylated threonine of the PKC consensus site to an alanine residue. This mutation did not significantly affect the ability of PMA to stimulate LRP tail release (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the LRP tail is not the primary mechanism by which PMA increases reporter gene activation. Also, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 25 or 46 amino acids of the LRP tail did not abolish basal or PMA-induced reporter gene transcription (data not shown).Figure 4PKC augments LRP-Gal4/VP16 reporter gene activity independent of phosphorylation of a PKC consensus site in the LRP tail, but accelerates cellular LRP turnover. A, mutation of the PKC consensus phosphorylation site in the LRP-tail does not alter reporter gene activity. 293 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of pG5E1B-Luc, 0.05 μg of pCMV-β-Gal, and 1 μg of pcDNA3.1-LRP-Gal4/VP16 (LRP-Gal4/VP16) or pcDNA3.1-LRP-T/A-Gal4/VP16 (LRP-T/A-Gal4/VP16). After 24 h the cells were treated in the presence or absence of 100 nm PMA and luciferase activity was determined and normalized as described. B, endogenous LRP levels are decreased by PMA. Untransfected 293 cells were treated with 100 nm PMA for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with an antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of the receptor.C, 293 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1-LRP. After 24 h cells were either treated with 100 nm PMA and 1 μm DAPT (lane 1), 100 nm PMA (lane 2), 1 μm DAPT (lane 3), or not treated (lane 4) for 16 h. Cell membranes were then isolated and analyzed by immunoblotting as described in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether accelerated turnover of LRP at the plasma membrane, resulting in increased release of the tail from the membrane, might be the reason for the PMA effect, we incubated untransfected HEK 293 cells in the absence (Fig. 4 B, lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of 100 nm PMA for 24 h and then prepared lysates from the treated and non-treated cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed greatly decreased levels of the 85-kDa LRP fragment and of the 600-kDa precursor after incubation with PMA, whereas a shorter fragment of ∼25kDa that reacted with an antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal epitope of LRP was increased in the membrane fractions of PMA-treated 293 cells compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and 4). This truncated carboxyl-terminal fragment of LRP is likely generated by proteolytic processing, or shedding, of the LRP ectodomain (23Quinn K.A. Pye V.J. Dai Y.P. Chesterman C.N. Owensby D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, PMA appears to increase LRP shedding, which would result in increased availability of substrate for the subsequent intramembranous or cytoplasmic cleavage event. γ-Secretase performs such an intramembranous proteolytic cleavage step in Notch and APP and thus is a candidate protease that might mediate the release of the LRP cytoplasmic domain from the 25-kDa precursor. In a preliminary experiment the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (27Dovey H.F. John V. Anderson J.P. Chen L.Z. de Saint Andrieu P. Fang L.Y. Freedman S.B. Folmer B. Goldbach E. Holsztynska E.J. Hu K.L.

A, LRP-Gal4/VP16-induced reporter gene activity is reduced by treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitors DAPT and l-685,458. 293 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of pG5E1B-Luc, 0.05 μg of pCMV-β-Gal, and 1 μg of pcDNA3.1-LRP-Gal4/VP16 (LRP-Gal4/VP16) or 1 μg pMstGV-APP (APP-Gal4/VP16). After 12 h the cells were treated with increasing amounts of DAPT (LRP, closed circles; APP, closed triangles) or l-685,458 (open circles) for 24 h. Cell lysates were assayed for reporter gene activity as described above. APP-Gal4/VP16 served as a control for the efficacy of DAPT. B, release of the cytoplasmic domain of LRP from membranes in vitro and is inhibited by DAPT. 293 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1-LRP (expression plasmid for LRP) in 100-mm dishes. 48 h later the cells were lysed, and membranes were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Resuspended membranes were incubated at 0 °C or at 37 °C for 1 h in the absence or presence of 500 nmDAPT. Pellet (P100) and supernatant (S100) fractions were prepared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of LRP. C, treatment of 293 cells with DAPT leads to accumulation of a membrane-bound 25-kDa fragment of LRP. 293 cells were transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3.1-LRP in 100-mm dishes. 12 h after transfection the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of DAPT for 24 h. Membranes were isolated and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of LRP. D, a 25-kDa LRP carboxyl-terminal fragment accumulates in N2a cells stably transfected with a dominant negative PS1-mutant cDNA. Membranes were prepared from N2a cells that expressed (PS1-D385A) or did not express (PS1-wt) a dominant negative acting PS1 cDNA (31Kim S.H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G.

After 2 days cell lysates were assayed for reporter gene activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Activation of reporter gene activity is an indirect measure of LRP tail release from cellular membranes. To directly demonstrate this release of the cytoplasmic domain of LRP, we transfected 293 cells with an LRP expression plasmid and incubated isolated membranes for 1 h in vitro in the presence or absence of DAPT at 0 °C or at 37 °C in the absence of cytoplasm (Fig. 5 B). Incubation at 37 °C, but not at 0 °C, caused the release of an ∼12-kDa fragment that could be detected with an antibody directed against the extreme carboxyl terminus of the LRP tail from the membranes (indicated by the arrow). The appearance of this fragment was completely blocked by DAPT. Furthermore, inhibition of γ-secretase activity by culturing 293 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of DAPT was accompanied by the accumulation of the carboxyl-terminal 25-kDa fragment in the membrane fraction (Fig. 5 C). Increased levels of this 25-kDa fragment were also observed in membrane preparations of N2a cells that stably express a dominant negative presenilin-1 mutant (PS1-D385A) (31Kim S.H. Leem J.Y.

LRP tail cleavage-dependent reporter gene activity was reduced by ∼75% in PS1-D385A-expressing N2a cells compared with PS1-wt cells (Fig. 5 E). Taken together, these results suggest that γ-secretase is involved in the processing of LRP but that one or more additional γ-secretase-insensitive, and presumably cytoplasmic, proteases can also participate.Modulation of LRP Cytoplasmic Domain-dependent Reporter Activity by Tail Binding ProteinsThe cytoplasmic tails of LRP and APP contain binding sites for a variety of adaptor and scaffold proteins, including FE65, a scaffolding protein that stimulates the nuclear import of the APP cytoplasmic domain and is likely also involved in the transcription of APP target genes (26Cao X.

We have identified a novel mammalian zinc transporter, zinc transporter 5 (ZnT-5), by virtue of its similarity to ZRC1, a zinc transporter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a member of the cation diffusion facilitator family. Human ZnT-5 (hZnT-5) cDNA encodes a 765-amino acid protein with 15 predicted membrane-spanning domains. hZnT-5 was ubiquitously expressed in all tested human tissues and abundantly expressed in the pancreas. In the human pancreas, hZnT-5 was expressed abundantly in insulin-containing β cells that contain zinc at the highest level in the body. The hZnT-5 immunoreactivity was found to be associated with secretory granules by electron microscopy. The hZnT-5-derived zinc transport activity was detected using the Golgi-enriched vesicles prepared from hZnT-5-induced HeLa/hZnT-5 cells in which exogenous hZnT-5 expression is inducible by the Tet-on gene regulation system. This activity was dependent on time, temperature, and concentration and was saturable. Moreover, zinc at a high concentration (10 mm) inhibited the growth of yeast expressing hZnT-5.

These results suggest that ZnT-5 plays an important role for transporting zinc into secretory granules in pancreatic β cells. Zinc is a trace element that is indispensable for life, because it is a key structural component of a large number of proteins such as metalloenzymes and zinc-dependent transcriptional factors (1Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). In mammals, zinc is absorbed from the diet through intestinal epithelial cells and is transported into the blood, where most of it is bound by albumin and α2-macroglobulin (3Reyes J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C401-C410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The circulating zinc is incorporated into all types of cells, and the cytosolic zinc is taken up by intracellular organelles. The kinetic studies and characterization of zinc transport using a variety of both animal cell systems and membrane vesicles have suggested the transporter-mediated movement of zinc (3Reyes J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C401-C410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, cDNAs of several zinc transporters have been molecularly cloned from mammals, and most of them have been assigned to two metal transporter families, the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) 1The abbreviations used are: CDFcation diffusion facilitatorZnT-5zinc transporter 5hZnT-5human ZnT-5mZnT-5mouse ZnT-5ESTexpressed sequence tagmAbmonoclonal antibodyZIPZRT/IRT-related proteinDoxdoxycyclineCMVcytomegalovirusORFopen reading frame family that functions in zinc efflux from cytoplasm and the ZRT/IRT-related protein (ZIP) family that functions in zinc influx into cytoplasm (4Cousins R.J.

CDF family members, ZnT-1 to -4, have characteristics of membrane topology such as six predicted membrane-spanning domains, a cytoplasmic histidine-rich loop between membrane-spanning domains IV and V, and both amino and carboxyl termini thought to reside intracellularly (5Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H., Jr. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The histidine-rich loop may construct a metal-binding site. In mammals, ZnT-1 is a probable zinc transporter responsible for zinc efflux across the plasma membranes (8Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). ZnT-2 is found on late endosomes, where it appears to facilitate zinc transport into its vesicle compartment (9Palmiter R.D.

In addition to the biological functions in metalloenzymes and transcription factors, zinc plays unique roles in some specialized cells (18Huang E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In hippocampal neurons and pancreatic β cells, a large amount of zinc is accumulated in cytoplasmic vesicles/granules (11Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14934-14939Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 21Zalewski P.D. Millard S.H. Forbes I.J. Kapaniris O. Slavotinek A. Betts W.H. Ward A.D. Lincoln S.F. Mahadevan I. J. Histochem.

Zinc in synaptic vesicles is co-secreted with neurotransmitters upon excitation; zinc is thought to modulate synaptic transmission (18Huang E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13386-13387Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In pancreatic β cells, zinc binds with proinsulin in the secretory pathway to form zinc proinsulin hexamers, which are subsequently converted into zinc insulin microcrystals for storage in secretory granules (19Dodson G. Steiner D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 22Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20417-20423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It is believed that formation of zinc proinsulin hexamers facilitates intracellular transport and that formation of microcrystals causes accumulation of insulin at a supersaturating concentration, thereby providing a mechanism for an acute secretion of insulin in response to glucose. ZnT-3 has been shown to be responsible for zinc accumulation in synaptic vesicles (12Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), but nothing is known about the mechanism by which zinc enters secretory granules in β cells. We previously showed transepithelial transport of several metal ions including zinc in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (23Nagao M. Sugaru E. Kambe T. Sasaki R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This finding prompted us to search the mouse expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences homologous to ZRC1 (24Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), an S. cerevisiae zinc transporter that belongs to the CDF family. Further data base analysis and subsequent experiments resulted in identifying a novel zinc transporter, ZnT-5, that has a very long unique amino-terminal sequence, followed by carboxyl-terminal sequence significantly homologous to CDF family members. ZnT-5 was expressed abundantly in the human pancreas in association with secretory granules. Here we report the structural characteristics and localization of ZnT-5. We propose that ZnT-5 may be a transporter of zinc into secretory granules in β cells. HeLa Tet-on cells (gift from Dr. Kazuhiro Iwai) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% Tet System Approved fetal bovine serum (CLONTECH) and 200 μg/ml G418 (Nacalai, Kyoto, Japan). JAR, HeLa, HEp-2 (gift from Dr. Mitsuaki Tabuchi), and Hep3B cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Trace Scientific Ltd.). To establish stable transfectants, we co-transfected HeLa Tet-on cells with pTK-hygromycin and pTRE-CMVmin-hZnT-5 or pTRE-CMVmin-FLAG-hZnT-5 plasmids. Drug-resistant clones were screened in the presence of 150 μg/ml Hygromycin B (Nacalai). From the resistant clones, a HeLa/hZnT-5 cell line harboring the pTRE-CMVmin-hZnT-5 and a HeLa/FLAG-hZnT-5 cell line harboring the pTRE-CMVmin-FLAG-hZnT-5 were selected on the basis of the highest inducibility of expression of hZnT-5 in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox). We found three mouse EST clones (AI020400, AA409021, and AA797841) with homology to ZRC1, a zinc transporter of S. cerevisiae. EST clones derived from mouse and human tissues with sequences contiguous with these three fragments were identified from the data base. Using two gene-specific primers designed based on these EST clones (forward primer (1231F), 5′-CTGTCTGGAGGAGTGGTAGT-3′; reverse primer (1400R), 5′-GGGATCGATTGAGAGCTATG–3′; numbering is defined as the transcription starting site as +1), the human placenta cDNA library was screened with the Rapid cDNA PCR Screening Service (TAKARA, Kyoto, Japan). Thus, the 3′ portion of a cDNA that hereafter is called human ZnT-5 (hZnT-5) was isolated. The 5′ portion of hZnT-5 cDNA was isolated by primer extension techniques using human liver poly(A) RNA (OriGene Technologies) and reverse primer (961R, 5′-TGACCCATGGGCACAA-3′) as previously described (25Ikura K. Nasu T. Yokota H. Tsuchiya Y. Sasaki R. Chiba H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2898-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These two portions were ligated to construct full-length hZnT-5. We discovered the mouse ZnT-5 (mZnT-5) gene by searching the EST data base using hZnT-5 cDNA as a query (AW910349). Sequence reactions on both strands were performed using DNA Sequencing Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All homology searches were performed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tools (BLAST; National Center for Biotechnology Information). Northern blot membranes for human multiple tissues and endocrine system purchased from CLONTECH were hybridized to hZnT-5 cDNA probe (from +930 to the poly(A) site) 32P-radiolabeled by using a random priming method (TAKARA) in Hybrisol I solution (Oncor), washed with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C twice, and then autoradiographed for 24 h. To construct pTRE-CMVmin-FLAG-hZnT-5, we fused the DNA fragment encoding FLAG heptapeptides (DYKDDDDK) plus start Met to the first ATG codon of hZnT-5 cDNA (FLAG-hZnT-5) and inserted it into a pUHG10–3 vector that includes Tet-inducible promoter-enhancer (26Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). In the same way, we inserted hZnT-5 cDNA into the pUHG10–3 vector to construct pTRE-CMVmin-hZnT-5. To produce an antigen, we constructed the plasmid for expression of a fused protein consisting of the carboxyl-terminal tail of hZnT-5 and maltose-binding protein. hZnT-5 cDNA corresponding to 133 amino acid residues from Ile633 to Met765 (see Fig. 1 B) was inserted, in-frame, downstream of maltose-binding protein in pMAL-C2X vector (New England Biolabs). An anti-hZnT-5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was produced as described previously (27Morishita E. Narita H. Nishida M. Kawashima N. Yamagishi K. Masuda S. Nagao M. Hatta H. Sasaki R. Blood. 1996; 88: 465-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hybridoma that produces anti-hZnT-5 mAb was subcloned by the limiting dilution method, and a clone named 1-7B was established. 1-7B mAb was IgG1 subclass. A ascites was generated by injection of 1 × 107 hybridoma cells into pristine-primed mice. 1-7B mAb was precipitated with 50% ammonium sulfate and purified with a protein G column. Double immunofluorescence for ZnT-5 and insulin was detected using paraffin sections from paraformaldehyde-fixed human pancreas. Dewaxed sections were incubated with 1-7B mAb (34 μg/ml), Cy3-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and guinea pig anti-insulin (5 μg/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in this order, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The stained sections were observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Fluoview; Olympus). For electron microscopy, the paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and processed by the pre-embedding silver-intensified immunogold method. After preincubation with normal goat serum, the samples were immunoreacted with 1-7B mAb (17 μg/ml) and further incubated with anti-mouse IgG covalently linked to 1.4-nm gold particles (Nanogold; Nanoprobes). Following silver enhancement (HQ silver; Nanoprobes), specimens were osmificated, dehydrated, and embedded in Quetol 812. Ultrathin sections were prepared with an ultramicrotome (Leica Ultracut UCT; Nissei Sangyo, Tokyo, Japan), and stained with an aqueous solution of 2% uranyl acetate for observation under a transmission electron microscope. Crude membrane proteins were prepared according to the method described by McMahon and Cousins (28McMahon R.J. Cousins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4841-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (∼1 × 107/15-cm dish) were scraped into 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. These cells were pelleted and resuspended in 3 ml of cold homogenizing buffer (0.25m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, and 1 mmEDTA containing protease inhibitors) and homogenized with 10 strokes of a very tight fitting 5-ml Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2200 rpm at 4 °C to remove nucleus. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of homogenizing buffer and stocked at −70 °C as membrane proteins. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged on a 0.7–1.7 m sucrose gradient to fractionate the membrane proteins with density. Membrane proteins were prepared from each fraction. A crude homogenate was prepared by homogenizing HeLa/hZnT-5 cells cultured for 36 h with 2.5 μg/ml Dox (hZnT-5-induced condition) or without Dox (uninduced condition) with 10 strokes of a very tight fitting 10-ml Dounce homogenizer. The crude homogenate (6 ml) in homogenizing buffer was adjusted to contain 1.4 m sucrose by the addition of 6 ml of 2.3 m sucrose containing 20 mm HEPES and 1 mm EDTA. The resulting mixture was overlaid with 14 ml of 1.2 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mmEDTA and 8 ml of 0.8 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA according to the methods described elsewhere (29Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The gradients were centrifuged for 2.5 h at 30,000 rpm. The turbid band at the 0.8 m/1.2 m sucrose interface was harvested by syringe puncture. These fractions were diluted to 0.25m sucrose by the addition of 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA and recentrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 rpm. The pellet resuspended in uptake buffer was used for 65Zn transport assays. Uptake of zinc into hZnT-5-induced vesicles was measured by the rapid filtration method (30Aslam N. McArdle H.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Vesicles (20 μg) were added to 120 μl of uptake buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmCaCl2) containing 65ZnCl2(PerkinElmer Life Science) and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated periods. The reaction was stopped by filtrating aliquots of the reaction mixture through 0.45-μm pore size nitrocellulose filters (Millipore Corp.), followed by washing twice with 1 ml of stopping buffer (uptake buffer containing 1 mm cold ZnCl2). The filters used in each assay were pretreated with 5 ml of stopping buffer. The rate of 65Zn uptake was estimated on an auto-γ counter, COBRA II (Packard Instrument Co.). Membrane proteins (20 μg) were lysed using 6× SDS sample buffer at 37 °C for 5 min and electrophoresed through 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pall Corporation), the blot was blocked with blocking solution (5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) and then incubated with 1-7B mAb (1:3000 dilution) or anti-GM130 polyclonal antibody (gift from Dr. Nobuaki Nakamura; 1:1500 dilution) in blocking solution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used at a 1:3000 dilution, and Super Signal Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) was used for the detection. The intensity of bands was measured using Image Gauge (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). The yeast strain used in this study was BY4742 (MATα his3 leu2 ura3). DNA transformations were performed using the lithium acetate procedure. Yeast was transformed with the control plasmid (pYES2), the plasmid containing hZnT-5 cDNA, or the plasmid containing 5′-deleted hZnT-5 cDNA (ΔhZnT-5) in which the amino-terminal nine membrane-spanning domains had been deleted. The transformed yeasts were grown at 30 °C for 3 days either on the YPD plates containing 2% galactose or on the same plates supplemented with 10 mm ZnSO4, 3 mm FeSO4, or 0.5 mmCoCl2. Data base comparisons of the mouse EST sequences with ZRC1 (24Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), a zinc transporter that belongs to CDF family, revealed several nucleotide fragments homologous to this transporter. Three of them were not found in known genes and partially overlapped. A further data base search of contiguous sequences identified a 2.3-kb fragment that contained a putative open reading frame (ORF), an in-frame termination codon, and a canonical polyadenylation signal. The 2.3-kb fragment did not contain a translation initiation codon, suggesting that this fragment is the 3′ portion of a longer cDNA. We obtained human and mouse full-length cDNAs by the combination of rapid cDNA PCR screening and primer extension technique. Human cDNA is shown in Fig. 1 A. Because this cDNA encodes a zinc transporter with homology to CDF family as described below, we hereafter refer to this protein as ZnT-5. The ATG at position +202 was assumed to initiate an ORF encoding hZnT-5 of 765 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). This initiation codon was preceded with a 200-bp untranslated region that contains two small ORFs that can encode two small peptides (3 and 13 amino acids long) by initiating at positions +103 and +152, respectively. Interestingly, this structure in the untranslated region is completely conserved in mZnT-5. mZnT-5 had 761 amino acids and showed high homology to hZnT-5 (94%; Fig. 1 B). Hydropathy plot analysis of hZnT-5 showed the potential 15 membrane-spanning domains (Fig. 1 C). The amino-terminal portion (∼400 amino acid residues) containing nine membrane-spanning domains showed little homology to known proteins. Northern blot analysis indicated that the hZnT-5 gene was ubiquitously expressed as 3- and 4-kb transcripts in human tissues (Fig. 2). High expression was seen in the pancreas, followed by the kidney and liver. hZnT-5 cDNA that we identified in this study corresponds to the 3-kb isoform. Analysis of the 4-kb transcript is under way in our laboratory. A region of the carboxyl-terminal end of hZnT-5 was used as an antigen for antibody production. This carboxyl-terminal region was fused with maltose-binding protein, and the fused protein was expressed in E. coli. Purified fusion protein was used as an antigen, and a hybridoma producing anti-hZnT-5 monoclonal antibody (1-7B mAb) was established. To demonstrate that hZnT-5 is a membrane protein, we carried out immunoblot analysis using the membrane and cytosolic fractions derived from some human cell lines (HEp-2, Hep3B, JAR, and HeLa cells) and HeLa/hZnT-5 cells in which exogenous hZnT-5 is inducible when cultured in the presence of Dox (Fig. 3 A). The 1-7B mAb recognized a 55-kDa protein in membrane fractions, and no positive bands were found in cytosolic fractions. The molecular size of hZnT-5 calculated from cDNA is 84 kDa. A significant difference in the calculated molecular size and that found by immunoblot analysis raised the possibility that hZnT-5 may be cleaved to yield the carboxyl-terminal protein detected by 1-7B mAb. To examine whether this is the case, we expressed the amino-terminal FLAG-tagged hZnT-5 protein in HeLa cells (HeLa/FLAG-hZnT-5) and detected the expressed hZnT-5 by an anti-FLAG antibody, M5. As Fig. 3 B shows, FLAG-hZnT-5 migrated with a size of 55–60 kDa, which is similar to the size detected by the 1-7B mAb. Thus, the 55-kDa protein that reacts with 1-7B mAb is the intact hZnT-5. Since hZnT-5 mRNA was abundantly expressed in human pancreas (see Fig. 2 B), we immunohistochemically examined the localization of hZnT-5. As shown in Fig. 4 A, expression of hZnT-5 in the human pancreas can be almost completely superimposed on that of insulin. β cells expressed ZnT-5 much more abundantly than the other types of pancreatic cells; hZnT-5 was undetectable in other endocrine cell types including α cells and was weakly detected in a limited number of acinar cells under the conditions used here. Moreover, the electron microscopic studies revealed that the immunoreactivity of hZnT-5 was associated with secretory granules (Fig. 4 B). It appears that hZnT-5 is located in the perimeter of granules, which suggests the localization of hZnT-5 in granular membrane. Since the carboxyl-terminal portion of hZnT-5 has a strong homology to zinc transporters belonging to the CDF family and hZnT-5 was abundantly expressed in pancreatic β cells in association with secretory granules, we tested whether hZnT-5 functions as a zinc transporter. We chose HeLa cells to find zinc transport activity of hZnT-5 because of their lesser expression of endogenous hZnT-5 among all tested human cell lines (data not shown). First, the subcellular localization of hZnT-5 was determined using HeLa/hZnT-5 cells cultured in the presence of Dox (hZnT-5-induced condition). The localization of hZnT-5 was indistinguishable from that of a marker protein of Golgi apparatus, GM130, by indirect immunoreactive staining (Fig. 5 A) and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5 B), indicating that most of hZnT-5 is present in Golgi apparatus. Next, because expression of hZnT-5 was increased 9-fold when HeLa/hZnT-5 cells were cultured in the induced condition (see Fig. 3 A), we examined whether the induced HeLa/hZnT-5 cells accumulate zinc in Golgi apparatus more than did the uninduced cells using Zinquin, a zinc-specific fluorescence probe. No significant difference was found between the induced and uninduced cells (data not shown). Then we tried to detect zinc transport activity of hZnT-5 using Golgi-enriched vesicles prepared from total membranes of HeLa/hZnT-5 cells cultured in either hZnT-5-induced or uninduced condition. The membranes were fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and 5-fold enrichment of Golgi membranes was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). hZnT-5-induced or uninduced vesicles were prepared from the enriched Golgi membranes (see “Experimental Procedures”) and used for 65Zn transport assays. Time course of 65Zn uptake into vesicles was investigated using the hZnT-5-induced vesicles or uninduced vesicles (Fig. 6 A). The 65Zn uptake into the hZnT-5-induced vesicles was higher than that of uninduced vesicles at 37 °C, although no difference in the uptake was seen at 4 °C. The increased uptake observed in hZnT-5-induced vesicles at 37 °C is probably caused by the induced hZnT-5 protein. The uptake at 37 °C was much larger than that at 4 °C, indicating that 65Zn uptake is likely transporter-mediated accumulation into vesicles rather than cell surface binding. Fig. 6 B shows that the rate of 65Zn uptake at 37 °C is concentration-dependent and saturable in both hZnT-5-induced vesicles and uninduced vesicles. The uptake rate in hZnT-5-induced vesicles at 37 °C was higher than that in uninduced vesicles. The exogenous hZnT-5-derived activity calculated by subtracting uptake rates of uninduced vesicles from those of hZnT-5-induced vesicles was also concentration-dependent and saturable. The saturation curve fitted Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent Km of 0.25 μm and a Vmax of 15 nmol/mg protein/min. In another study, we examined the growth dependence of hZnT-5-induced and uninduced HeLa/hZnT-5 cells on zinc in the medium but found no differences with the concentration of zinc (data not shown). Then, we examined the effects of hZnT-5 expression on yeast. The yeast expressing hZnT-5 grew normally in the normal medium (Fig. 6 C, left) but showed poor growth in medium containing 10 mm zinc, which is the upper limit for the control yeast to grow (Fig. 6 C, middle). A high iron concentration had no effect (Fig. 6 C, right). It is noted that the growth of the yeast expressing the 5′-deleted hZnT-5 cDNA (ΔhZnT-5) in which the amino-terminal nine membrane-spanning domains have been deleted is unaffected by zinc at a high concentration (Fig. 6 C, middle). This result indicates that hZnT-5 acts as a zinc transporter, although the mechanism responsible for the zinc-sensitive phenotype remains to be identified. A similar sensitive phenotype was seen in the presence of a high cobalt concentration (0.5 mm), suggesting that cobalt is a potential substrate of hZnT-5 (data not shown). A data base search of DNA sequences homologous to a yeast zinc transporter and cloning of full-length cDNA revealed a novel protein, which appeared to be a zinc transporter consisting of 765 amino acid residues. The primary sequence was well conserved in human and mouse. Since its carboxyl-terminal portion (365 amino acid residues) contains six membrane-spanning domains, a structural characteristic of metal transporters in the CDF family, and is highly homologous to mammalian zinc transporters (ZnT-1 to -4) that belong to the CDF family, we refer to this transporter as ZnT-5. Functional assays of this protein using Golgi-enriched vesicles and yeast cells supported this classification. ZnT-5, however, has a very long amino-terminal portion (400 amino acid residues) with nine membrane-spanning domains. MSC2 (YDR205W) protein (a CDF family member) with zinc homeostasis function in yeast has been shown to contain 12 membrane-spanning domains (31Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MSC2 and ZnT-5 are homologous in the carboxyl-terminal portions with six membrane-spanning domains but not in the amino-terminal portions. To our knowledge, there is only one protein homologous to the amino-terminal portion of ZnT-5 in Caenorhabditis elegans (CAB81912). The function of this C. elegans protein is unknown. The functions of most members of the CDF family have been examined by overexpression experiments; i.e. the cells gain resistance to metal toxicity, indicating that the six membrane-spanning domain is sufficient to exhibit transporter activity. These facts raised the possibility that ZnT-5 may posttranslationally be cleaved to yield the carboxyl-terminal fragment for manifesting transporter activity. This is unlikely because immunoblot analysis by the use of 1-7B mAb against the carboxyl-terminal peptide of hZnT-5 and the antibody against FLAG tagged at the amino terminus detected hZnT-5 with a similar molecular size. Furthermore, zinc at a high concentration inhibited the growth of yeast expressing the full-length hZnT-5 cDNA but not that of yeast expressing the 5′-deletion form of hZnT-5 cDNA (ΔhZnT-5). CDF family members are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (5Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H., Jr. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar,32van der Zaal B.J. Neuteboom L.W. Pinas J.E. Chardonnens A.N. Schat H. Verkleij J.A. Hooykaas P.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and complementation assays between different species have been successful (14Huang L. Gitschier J. Nat.

A. 2001; 98: 9995-10000Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For example, expression of mouse ZnT-4 in Δzrc1 yeast that cannot grow in medium containing zinc at a high concentration due to insufficient efflux of zinc allows the yeast to grow. Expression of hZnT-5 in Δzrc1 yeast, however, could not reduce zinc toxicity (data not shown). Instead, wild-type yeast expressing hZnT-5 showed limited growth at a high zinc concentration. We attempted to determine the localization of hZnT-5 expressed in yeast, but unfortunately yeast contained protein(s) that cross-reacts with 1-7B mAb; the high background made it difficult to localize hZnT-5 in yeast. The mechanism making the yeast hypersensitive to zinc remains unknown. Nevertheless, a zinc-dependent phenotype of yeast expressing hZnT-5 provides additional support that ZnT-5 transports zinc. Gaither and Eide (17Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) have reported a similar finding that yeast expressing hZIP1, a mammalian zinc transporter belonging to the ZIP family, shows limited growth at a high zinc concentration. hZIP1 does not complement the Δzrt1/zrt2 double mutant yeast strain, which cannot grow in a zinc-limiting condition (17Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22258-22264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The intracellular concentration of free zinc is estimated to be at a nanomolar level (34Williams R.J.P. Mills C.F. Zinc in Human Biology. Springer-Verlag, New York1989Google Scholar), because the major part of zinc in cytoplasm is bound to proteins such as methallothionein. A Km value of ∼0.25 μm that we calculated from the in vitro zinc transporter activity of hZnT-5 is relatively high, suggesting that free zinc may not be a real substrate of ZnT-5. A transport assay under conditions that mimic intracellular environments more faithfully is necessary. The addition of H+ and ATP showed no effects in zinc uptake by hZnT-5-induced vesicles (data not shown). Zinc is not only a key structural component of a large number of zinc-containing proteins but also possesses important modulator functions in some specialized cells (1Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 18Huang E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One of these is the formation of zinc insulin microcrystals in secretory granules in pancreatic β cells. Zinc in these granules is believed to play two indispensable roles to store insulin in crystal forms (19Dodson G. Steiner D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 22Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar); first, two zinc ions are bound with six proinsulin molecules to form a hexamer, which occurs just after endoplasmic reticulum export of proinsulin. Second, zinc promotes the granule core (crystal) formation, which occurs after proteolytic conversion from proinsulin to insulin in secretory granules. The extensive accumulation of zinc in pancreatic β cells suggests that these cells are equipped with the powerful machinery that drives zinc influx into secretory granules. However, which transporter handles zinc into endoplasmic reticulum and secretory granules is unknown. Recently, mRNAs of ZnT-1 to -4 in pancreatic islets were detected by RT-PCR techniques (36Clifford K.S. MacDonald M.J. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 2000; 49: 77-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but neither the cellular nor subcellular distribution of these transporter proteins in the pancreas is known. We found that hZnT-5 protein is abundantly expressed in human pancreatic β cells but not in glucagon-secreting α cells and most acinar cells. It is noteworthy that hZnT-5 is associated with secretory granules. From these results, we propose that ZnT-5 is responsible for transporting zinc into secretory granules to form insulin crystals. Since ZnT-5 is ubiquitously expressed, however, ZnT-5 probably plays a role in the movement of zinc in a variety of tissues. We thank Drs. Kazuhiro Iwai and Mitsuaki Tabuchi for providing the cell lines used in this work and Dr. Nobuaki Nakamura for providing the GM130 polyclonal antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2124893433,"The events linking sensory discrimination to motor action remain unclear. It is not known, for example, whether the motor areas of the frontal lobe receive the result of the discrimination process from other areas or whether they actively participate in it. To investigate this, we trained monkeys to discriminate between two mechanical vibrations applied sequentially to the fingertips; here subjects had to recall the first vibration, compare it to the second one, and indicate with a hand/arm movement which of the two vibrations had the higher frequency. We recorded the activity of single neurons in medial premotor cortex (MPC) and found that their responses correlate with the diverse stages of the discrimination process. Thus, activity in MPC reflects the temporal evolution of the decision-making process leading to action selection during this perceptual task."

The eIF2, combined with initiator methionyl-tRNA and GTP, associates with the 40 S ribosomal subunit and participates in the recognition of the start codon during initiation of translation (19Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews W.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). During the joining of the small and large ribosomal subunit, GTP complexed with eIF2 is hydrolyzed to GDP. Phosphorylation of eIF2 by PEK reduces the exchange of eIF2-GDP to the GTP-bound form that is catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. The resulting reduction in eIF2-GTP levels impedes translation initiation in the cell, allowing the cell sufficient time to correct the folding problem incurred by the ER stress prior to synthesizing additional proteins. Accompanying this reduction in translation during ER stress is the unfolded protein response (UPR) (17Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, 18Ron D.

The UPR involves the expression of a large number of secretory pathway genes, including those involved in protein folding, such as ER chaperones GRP78/BiP and GRP94, disulfide bond formation, protein glycosylation, retrograde protein degradation, translocation, and vesicle trafficking (21Travers K.J.

Phosphorylation of eIF2 by PEK is proposed to work in concert with IRE1 to enhance the coordinate expression of proteins linked with the UPR by a mechanism involving preferential translation of certain of mRNAs (18Ron D.

In addition to sharing a common topological arrangement in the ER membrane, a portion of the ER luminal sequences of PEK shares homology with IRE1, suggesting that there is a common mechanism activating the cytoplasmic protein kinase activities in response to the ER stress (13Harding H.P.

Loss of PEK (Perk) function in mouse embryonic stem cells exposed to ER stress leads to inappropriately elevated protein synthesis that further exacerbates protein misfolding in this organelle, triggering apoptosis (15Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Loss of PEK (EIF2AK3 gene) in humans leads to a rare autosomal recessive disorder, Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, that is characterized by neonatal insulin-dependent diabetes accompanied by a characteristic destruction of the pancreatic beta cells (28Delepine M. Nicolino M. Barrett T. Golamaully M. Lathrop G.M. Julier C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, Wolcott-Rallison syndrome patients do not display autoantibodies diagnostic of type I diabetes. At later ages, there is an occurrence of epiphyseal dysplasia, osteoporosis, and growth retardation. Frequently, afflicted patients also suffer from multisystemic pathologies including hepatic and renal complications, cardiovascular disease, and mental retardation (29Thornton C.M. Carson D.J.

PEK−/− mice display similar pancreatic defects and succumb to complications related to severe hyperglycemia within several weeks of birth (11Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M.

PEK and each of the other eIF2 kinases are proposed to share common features in their mechanisms of activation in response to stress. Direct binding with ligands whose concentrations are impacted by stress or with proteins whose levels or properties are altered by stress can trigger an activated eIF2 kinase conformation. For example, dsRNA produced during different viral infections binds cooperatively with two dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) in PKR, leading to enhanced eIF2 kinase activity (3Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 4Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the case of HRI, association with chaperones HSP90 and HSC70 is thought to be important for modulating HRI activity in response to heme deprivation or heat shock (6Chen J.-J. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 529-546Google Scholar, 31Uma S. Hartson S.D. Chen J.J. Matts R.L. J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5861-5871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding with ER chaperone GRP78 or its yeast homologue KAR2 is proposed to regulate the ER transmembrane protein kinase IRE1 and possibly PEK (33Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar, 34Okamura K. Kimata Y. Higashio H. Tsuru A. Kohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). With the accumulation of misfolded protein during ER stress, the chaperone may be titrated from the regulatory sequences shared between IRE1 and PEK, facilitating autophosphorylation and eIF2 kinase activity. Accompanying this activated conformation is autophosphorylation involving threonine residues in the so-called activation loop of the kinase domain. PEK was reported to be autophosphorylated in vitro at 10 different sites, including threonine 980 located in the activation loop, and hyperphosphorylation as judged by retarded migration of PEK in SDS-PAGE is thought to participate in kinase activation in response to cellular ER stress (13Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar, 14Sood R. Porter A.C., Ma, K. Quilliam L.A. Wek R.C. Biochem.

In this report, we find that PEK dimerization is required for hyperphosphorylation and induced eIF2 kinase activity during ER stress, and this oligomerization is mediated by ER luminal sequences extending beyond the IRE1 homology domain. PEK association with ER chaperones GRP78 and GRP94 is released upon ER stress, and deletion of sequences in PEK that facilitate GRP78 binding leads to activation as judged by hyperphosphorylation, independent of ER stress. Together, these results support the model whereby different ER chaperones bind and repress PEK, and release of this interaction in response to protein misfolding in the ER facilitates PEK dimerization, autophosphorylation, and induced eIF2 phosphorylation. cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant versions of PEK illustrated in Fig. 1 were inserted downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter in plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). These plasmids include pKM10 (wild-type PEK), pKM24 (PEK-K621M), pKM68 (PEK C-A), pKM39 (PEK-Δ1), pKM42 (PEK-Δ2), pKM43 (PEK-Δ3), pKM47 (PEK-Δ4), pKM66 (PEK-Δ4-K621M), pKM56 (PEK-Δ1–3), pKM67 (PEK-Δ1–3-K621M), pKM57 (PEK-Δ1–4), pKM29 (PEK-ΔC), and pKM65 (PEK-ΔC C-A). PEK-K621M, which contains Lys for Met-621 and PEK C-A containing Ala substitutions for Cys at residues 215, 220, 335, and 452), were made by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Deletions in PEK were constructed by standard PCR methods (36Kramer M.F. Coen D.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A.

To facilitate immunoprecipitation, the c-Myc epitope was inserted at the carboxyl terminus of full-length PEK, PEK-Δ1–3, PEK-Δ1–4, and PEK-ΔC. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells that express SV40 T antigen were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker), supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) in humidified air with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells grown in 100-mm dishes were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding wild-type or mutant versions of PEK or vector alone by using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). After culturing the transfected cells for 48 h, cells were treated with 1 μm thapsigargin for 1 h or 5 mm homocysteine for 3 h. Cells then were washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered solution. Cell lysates were prepared in 500 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 17.5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin) and clarified by centrifugation. Rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against recombinant protein containing the carboxyl terminus of human PEK, and the antibody was further prepared by affinity purification. Polyclonal antibody against c-Myc, GRP78, GRP94, and HSP70 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Equal amounts of lysates prepared from HEK 293T cells transfected with the pcDNA3 plasmid expressing PEK were separated by electrophoresis in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked in a TBS-T solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20 supplemented with 4% nonfat milk. Filters were then incubated in TBS-T-containing PEK-specific antibody and 4% nonfat milk, washed three times in TBS-T, and incubated with TBS-T-containing goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Filters were washed three times in TBS-T solution, and the PEK-antibody complex was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunoblots measuring eIF2α phosphorylation were carried out with antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated eIF2 at Ser-51 (Research Genetics) (37Vattem K.M. Staschke K.A. Wek R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3674-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Total eIF2α in lysates was detected by immunoblot using monoclonal antibody generously provided by Dr. Scot Kimball (Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA) that recognizes either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated forms of this initiation factor. The eIF2α-antibody complex was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody and chemiluminescent substrate. To establish linearity in the assay, proteins were serially diluted in the SDS-PAGE, and multiple autoradiographic exposures were performed. Immunoblot analyses measuring phosphorylated PEK were performed using rabbit polyclonal antiserum that specifically recognizes PEK phosphorylated at Thr-980. In experiments incorporating immunoprecipitations, equal amounts of protein lysates prepared from 293T-derived cells were precleared with protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Agarose was collected by centrifugation for 20 s at 12,000 × g, and the supernatants were incubated with goat polyclonal antibody against GRP78 or with mouse monoclonal antibody against the c-Myc tag for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Antibody complexes were collected by using protein G-agarose incubated for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation for 20 s at 12,000 × g. Agarose pellets were washed twice with lysis buffer, twice with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), and twice with low salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100). Immunoprecipitated proteins were heated at 95 °C for 3 min in the presence of SDS sample buffer and clarified by centrifugation. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and PEK, GRP78, GRP94, or HSP70 was visualized by immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies. Proteins associated with antibodies were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and chemiluminescent substrate. Linearity of the immunoblot analyses was confirmed by using serial dilutions of protein sample and by performing multiple autoradiographic exposures of different length times. PEK immunoprecipitation kinase assays were carried out as described using recombinant eIF2α substrate and [γ-32P]ATP in a final ATP concentration of 50 μm (38Zhu S. Sobolev A.Y. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 39Vattem K.M. Staschke K.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1143-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the study measuring PEK binding with GRP78, we used antibody specific to this ER chaperone in the immunoprecipitation, followed by PEK or GRP78 immunoblot analysis of proteins in the immune complex. GRP78 binding was calculated as the level of PEK in the complex normalized for the level of immunoprecipitated GRP78. Values were presented relative to wild-type PEK co-precipitated with GRP78. In the dimerization study that defined the dimerization region of PEK, the relative density was determined for each PEK band in the immunoblot analysis. Oligomerization was calculated as the ratio of the nontagged PEK protein to the c-Myc-tagged version of PEK-ΔC in each immunoprecipitation sample. Values were normalized for wild-type PEK co-immunoprecipitated with PEK-ΔC. It is noted that the PEK antibody was prepared against recombinant protein containing residues 588–1115. Although it can recognize PEK-ΔC, which includes residues 1061–1115, immunoblots using this PEK antibody presumably underrepresent PEK-ΔC levels compared with PEK containing the entire carboxyl terminus. Additionally, we carried out immunoblots using antibody specific to the c-Myc tag of PEK-ΔC and found that the relative levels of the truncated kinase between the preparations were identical to that measured with the PEK antibody (data not shown). It is noted that HEK 293T cells expressing PEK-Δ4 consistently expressed less of the co-transfected c-Myc-PEK-ΔC. Similar results were obtained with three independent experiments. Proteins in cell lysates were separated on a 12-ml exponential 20–40% glycerol gradient in cell lysis buffer described above. The gradient was subjected to ultracentrifugation using a Beckman SW41 rotor, at 39,000 rpm for 42 h at 4 °C. One-ml fractions were collected from the gradients. Equal volumes from each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, and PEK levels were measured by immunoblot analysis using PEK-specific antibody and densitometry. Size standards used in the glycerol gradients included albumin, aldolase, catalase, ferritin, and thyroglobulin (Amersham Biosciences). To address the multimeric state of PEK during nonstressed and ER-stressed conditions, lysates from HEK 293T cells were characterized by glycerol gradient centrifugation, and fractions were assayed for the presence of PEK by immunoblot. ER stress was induced by adding thapsigargin to the cells, resulting in the release of calcium from this organelle. In nonstressed conditions, PEK sedimented with a molecular weight of appropriately 210,000, which increased to 320,000 in response to ER stress (Fig. 2). The higher molecular weight form observed in response to ER stress was confirmed using HEK 293T cells that overexpressed PEK by transfection of a pcDNA3 derivative encoding PEK downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Migration of PEK in either condition was significantly higher than its monomeric size of 125,000, indicating that PEK oligomerized or interacted with other proteins. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis of PEK in the higher molecular weight form indicated that it sedimented more slowly in the SDS-PAGE as compared with nonstressed conditions (Fig. 2,B and C). The slower mobility in the denaturing gel electrophoresis is the result of hyperphosphorylation of PEK in response to ER stress, and this migration difference is absent following phosphatase treatment or when kinase-defective mutants of PEK are similarly analyzed (13Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar, 14Sood R. Porter A.C., Ma, K. Quilliam L.A. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 281-293Crossref Google Scholar). It has been suggested that oligomerization involving the luminal portion of the ER transmembrane protein kinase IRE1, and possibly PEK, is important for their activation in response to ER stress (27Liu C.Y. Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24881-24885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 33Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat.

Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 245-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The higher molecular weight measured for PEK during this cellular stress would be consistent with dimerization between PEK molecules. To address this premise, we expressed a c-Myc-tagged version of PEK that was substantially deleted for its cytoplasmic portion (Fig. 1). If PEK oligomerization is required for PEK phosphorylation in trans and enhanced eIF2 kinase activity, we reasoned that the PEK-ΔC would function as a dominant-negative. By binding with the luminal sequences of the endogenous full-length PEK, PEK-ΔC would block appropriate autophosphorylation required to facilitate an activated conformation of the full-length kinase. Indeed, expression of the truncated PEK-ΔC in HEK 293T cells blocked hyperphosphorylation of PEK in response to thapsigargin treatment as judged by the retarded migration of PEK in the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). Moreover, expression of PEK-ΔC significantly diminished the induction of eIF2α phosphorylation in response to thapsigargin exposure. Levels of total eIF2 were unchanged between cell lysates. To determine whether PEK-ΔC functioned as a dominant-negative in response to other ER stress agents, we carried out an analogous experiment using homocysteine, a known inducer of the UPR (42Austin R.C. Sood S.K. Dorward A.M. Singh G. Shaughnessy S.G. Pamidi S. Outinen P.A. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 43Zhang C.

Consistent with our earlier observation, PEK hyperphosphorylation was induced in response to homocysteine treatment of the HEK 293T cells, and expression of PEK-ΔC blocked both autophosphorylation and eIF2α phosphorylation in response to this ER stress agent (Fig. 3B). We conclude that PEK-ΔC can function as a dominant-negative in response to different ER stress conditions. To ascertain whether PEK-ΔC directly interacts with full-length PEK, the two forms of the eIF2 kinase were co-expressed in HEK 293T cells, and the c-Myc-tagged PEK-ΔC was immunoprecipitated using c-Myc-specific antibody. Proteins in the immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, and PEK was visualized by immunoblot. Wild-type PEK co-immunoprecipitated with PEK-ΔC, whereas no full-length kinase immunoprecipitated with the c-Myc antibody in the absence of PEK-ΔC expression (Fig. 3C). Together, our results are consistent with the idea that in response to ER stress PEK dimerizes through ER luminal sequences. The observation that PEK-ΔC complexes with the full-length version of the eIF2 kinase provided a tool to address the portions of the kinase that mediate oligomerization. At least four cysteine residues are present in the luminal portion of PEK from humans, mice, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans (14Sood R. Porter A.C., Ma, K. Quilliam L.A. Wek R.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 281-293Crossref Google Scholar). Notably, two cysteine residues at positions 215 and 220 in the human eIF2 kinase are invariant between these PEK homologues and IRE1. We substituted alanine for each of the four cysteine residues in the luminal portion of PEK-ΔC and analyzed the ability of this form of the truncated PEK (PEK-ΔC C-A) to complex with wild-type PEK. Following the experimental strategy described earlier, full-length eIF2 kinase was found to co-immunoprecipitate with the c-Myc-tagged version of PEK-ΔC C-A (Fig. 4A). No wild-type PEK was observed to immunoprecipitate using lysates devoid of the truncated kin"
https://openalex.org/W2071322539,"The slow (<1 Hz) rhythm is a defining feature of the electroencephalogram during sleep. Since cortical circuits can generate this rhythm in isolation, it is assumed that the accompanying slow oscillation in thalamocortical (TC) neurons is largely a passive reflection of neocortical activity. Here we show, however, that by activating the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), mGluR1a, cortical inputs can recruit intricate cellular mechanisms that enable the generation of an intrinsic slow oscillation in TC neurons in vitro with identical properties to those observed in vivo. These mechanisms rely on the ""window"" component of the T-type Ca(2+) current and a Ca(2+)-activated, nonselective cation current. These results suggest an active role for the thalamus in shaping the slow (<1 Hz) sleep rhythm."
https://openalex.org/W2073660522,"α-Catenin is an integral component of adherens junctions, where it links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton. α-Catenin is also required for the colocalization of the nectin/afadin/ponsin adhesion system to adherens junctions, and it specifically associates with the nectin-binding protein afadin. A proteolytic fragment of α-catenin, residues 385–651, contains the afadin-binding site. The three-dimensional structure of this fragment comprises two side-by-side four-helix bundles, both of which are required for afadin binding. The α-catenin fragment 385–651 binds afadin more strongly than the full-length protein, suggesting that the full-length protein harbors a cryptic binding site for afadin.

(2001) EMBO J. 20, 3645–3656) reveals a surprising flexibility in the orientation of the two four-helix bundles. α-Catenin and the actin-binding protein vinculin share sequence and most likely structural similarity within their actin-binding domains. Despite this homology, actin binding requires additional sequences adjacent to this region. α-Catenin is an integral component of adherens junctions, where it links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton. α-Catenin is also required for the colocalization of the nectin/afadin/ponsin adhesion system to adherens junctions, and it specifically associates with the nectin-binding protein afadin. A proteolytic fragment of α-catenin, residues 385–651, contains the afadin-binding site. The three-dimensional structure of this fragment comprises two side-by-side four-helix bundles, both of which are required for afadin binding. The α-catenin fragment 385–651 binds afadin more strongly than the full-length protein, suggesting that the full-length protein harbors a cryptic binding site for afadin. Comparison of the α-catenin 385–651 structure with the recently solved structure of the α-catenin M-fragment (Yang, J., Dokurno, P., Tonks, N. K., and Barford, D.

Despite this homology, actin binding requires additional sequences adjacent to this region. Specific cell-cell contacts establish and maintain the complex architecture of tissues (1Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). These contacts are highly dynamic and regulated during morphogenesis or tissue remodeling, and must be strong enough to withstand mechanical stresses placed upon the tissue. In polarized epithelial cells, three different types of cell-cell junctions, tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes, are aligned along the apical-basal axis of the lateral membrane. In adherens junctions, classical cadherins function as homophilic adhesion molecules. Clustering of cadherins and their attachment to the actin cytoskeleton are key steps in the assembly of functional adherens junctions. Cadherin clustering facilitates formation of lateral cis-dimers between cadherin molecules on the same cell surface. Cis-dimers have a much higher activity for adhesive trans-interaction between molecules on opposing cells (2Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J.

Anchorage to the cytoskeleton may promote cis-dimerization and higher order clustering and thereby contribute to strengthening of cell adhesion (5Adams C.L. Nelson W.J. Smith S.J. J.

Linkage of classical cadherins to the cytoskeleton is mediated by proteins termed catenins. β-Catenin and plakoglobin (γ-catenin) both bind in a mutually exclusive manner to the cytoplasmic domain of classical cadherins, and interact with α-catenin (7Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 8Jou T.S. Stewart D.B. Stappert J. Nelson W.J. Marrs J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Additionally, α-catenin interacts with spectrin, which might play a role in assembly of the cortical spectrin cytoskeleton (15Pradham D. Lombardo C.R. Roe S. Rimm D.L. Morrow J.S. J. Biol.

The diversity of these binding partners indicates that α-catenin plays a key role in assembly of adherens junctions.

Nectin is a homophilic cell adhesion protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Afadin, an F-actin-binding protein, contains a PDZ domain that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of nectin (16Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki N.

Afadin exists in two splice variants: l-afadin is expressed ubiquitously, whereas s-afadin is found only in neural tissues (18Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka M. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Like cadherins, nectin forms cis-dimers, which might be required for trans-interactions (19Miyahara M. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Satoh-Horikawa K. Tachibana K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 613-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Binding of afadin to the cytoplasmic domain of nectin is not required for cis- or trans-interactions, but it is required for clustering of nectin molecules in cell-cell contact sites and for colocalization of the NAP adhesion system with cadherins (19Miyahara M.

Analysis of afadin (−/−) mice shows that afadin is essential for proper organization of adherens junctions and tight junctions in epithelial cells (20Ikeda W. Nakanishi H. Miyoshi J. Mandai K.

However, initial attempts to demonstrate a direct interaction between afadin and α-catenin using recombinant full-length proteins failed (22Sakisaka T. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Mandai K. Miyahara M. Satoh A. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1998; 18: 1609-1617Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently a direct interaction between the C-terminal half of α-catenin and afadin was shown by yeast two hybrid and in vitro binding analysis (21Tachibana K. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Ozaki K. Ikeda W. Yamamoto Y. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1161-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The observation that a truncated form, but not full-length α-catenin, binds to afadin suggests that afadin binding is regulated through exposure of a cryptic binding site in α-catenin. We present here the structure of a proteolytically derived fragment of α-catenin, residues 385–651, and demonstrate that it comprises the l-afadin-binding site. Structural and biochemical data suggest mechanisms for unmasking the cryptic l-afadin-binding site in α-catenin. α-Catenin is homologous to the actin-binding protein vinculin. Structural similarity has been proposed for the two proteins for more than 80% of their sequence (23Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S.

Despite strong sequence homology between the actin-binding region of vinculin and a C-terminal portion of α-catenin, we show that α-catenin requires additional sequences for binding to actin. Full-length α-catenin used in the limited proteolysis experiment was expressed with a C-terminal His6-tag (28Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); for expression of the N-terminal GST fusion protein, full-length α-catenin was inserted into the pGEX-KG vector, a modified form of pGEX-2T (AmershamBiosciences), in which a linker of 5 glycine residues is introduced between the thrombin cleavage and the multiple cloning sites (29Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar). 2Y. T. Chen and W. J. Nelson, unpublished data. All α-catenin fragments were amplified by PCR. α-Catenin 385–651 and α-catenin 385–507 were cloned into the pGEX-2T expression vector (AmershamBiosciences). α-Catenin 632–906, α-catenin 671–906, and α-catenin 678–864 were cloned into the pGEX-4T-3 vector (AmershamBiosciences), and α-catenin 507–632 was introduced into the pGEX-KG vector. GST-full-length α-catenin was expressed in E. coli Ab1899 cells, and all other GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin until an A600 of 0.8–1.0 was reached. Cells were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-g-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for an additional 4 h. After centrifugation, the pelleted cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and lysed by passage through a French pressure cell. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and subsequently incubated with glutathione-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. α-Catenin 385–651, α-catenin 385–507, and α-catenin 507–632 were cleaved from the GST-tag with trypsin (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated, Sigma) (4.8, 48, and 240 units/ml of 50% beads, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature), whereas α-catenin 632–906, α-catenin 671–906, and α-catenin 678–864 were cleaved with bovine thrombin (Sigma) (1.1, 6.6, and 7.6 units/ml of 50% beads for 1 h at room temperature). GST fusion proteins were eluted from the beads with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm reduced glutathione. The proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography (Mono Q column, Amersham Biosciences) or in case of α-catenin 678–864 and α-catenin 671–906 by cation exchange chromatography (Mono S,Amersham Biosciences). To incorporate selenomethionine into the α-catenin 385–651 fragment, the expression vector was transformed into the methionine auxotroph strain B834 (Novagen). Cells were grown in defined medium containing 250 μm selenomethionine and supplemented with Kao and Michayluk vitamin solution (Sigma). Crystals of selenomethionine-labeled α-catenin 385–651 were grown at room temperature in an anaerobic chamber by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, by mixing 1 μl of a 80 mg/ml protein solution with 1 μl of the well solution containing 700 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1.05 m urea, 200 mm sodium/potassium tartrate, and 3% isopropanol. Crystals grew from a heavy precipitate. Crystals were adapted for cryoprotection by transfer into synthetic mother liquor solutions containing 5% step increases of ethylene glycol to a final concentration of 30% and frozen in a 100 K nitrogen gas stream. The crystals belong to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimension a = 64.8 Å, b = 105.3 Å, and c = 123.9 Å. There are three molecules in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to a solvent content of 48%. Typical dimensions of the crystals were 200 × 200 × 150 μm. Diffraction data were measured from a single crystal at beamline 1–5 of the Stanford Synchroton Radiation Laboratory. Complete data to 2.5 Å Bragg spacings were collected at four wavelengths at 120 s per 1° exposure on an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector. Data were integrated and scaled using Denzo and Scalepack (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). An automated Patterson search revealed five sites, and two additional sites were identified from anomalous and dispersive difference Fourier maps calculated with phases made from the five-site model, giving a total of 7 out of 21 possible sites. Solvent flipping did not significantly improve the phases and was therefore not used. The electron density map calculated from the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phases was of sufficient quality to assign the sequence for most of the model. To reduce model bias, the initial rounds of refinement were carried out using the complex structure factors (MLHL target in CNS). After seven rounds of refinement the model was refined against the edge data set with a maximum likelihood target using amplitudes only. Bulk solvent and anisotropic temperature factor corrections were applied during all rounds of refinement. After several rounds of minimization and two rounds of simulated annealing, all side chains could be placed. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints, even at a low weight, resulted in higher R-factors and were therefore not used. Individual temperature factors were refined in the later stages of refinement. The limited resolution precluded extensive modeling of water molecules, but a limited number of water molecules could be identified as Fo − Fc peaks above 3 standard deviations with sensible hydrogen bonding geometry. Phasing and refinement statistics are shown in Table I. Purified protein was concentrated and dialyzed against 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0; dilutions required to adjust the protein concentration were made with the same buffer. In a final reaction volume of 30 μl, protein samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 30-fold excess of the cross-linker DMS (dimethyl suberimidate) or BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate) (Pierce). After incubation, samples were immediately boiled in gel loading buffer and separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel in the case of α-catenin 385–651 and a 15% polyacrylamide gel in case of the two smaller fragments. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 10% CO2atmosphere. Approximately 70% confluent MDCK cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, containing 50 μmCaCl2. Cells were scraped from the plate into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm benzamindine), and the cells were lysed for 30 min on ice. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 1600 × g at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-agarose at a concentration of 4.75 × 10−9 m/200 μl of 50% bead suspension. 80 μl of a 50% bead suspension were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with lysate obtained from two 15-cm diameter culture plates. Beads were washed four times with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and boiled in 40 μl of SDS loading buffer. Samples were run on a 7% polyacrylamide gel and subsequently electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk, the membranes were incubated with a monoclonal mouse anti-l-afadin antibody, followed by incubation with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody. Bands were visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Monomeric rabbit skeletal muscle actin (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) was stored in 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm ATP at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml (9.5 μm). 50-μl aliquots were polymerized by addition of 5 μl of 10-fold concentrated actin polymerization buffer (500 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm ATP) and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Protein stocks used in the following step were precleared by centrifugation at 436,000 × g for 7 min to exclude cosedimentation of aggregates. After the addition of 5 μl of protein stock solution (100 μm) to the polymerized actin aliquots, samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Protein bound to F-actin was separated from unbound protein by centrifugation at 436,000 × g at 4 °C for 7 min. 30 μl of the supernatant were mixed with 10 μl of 4× gel loading buffer, boiled, and loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The pellet was resuspended in 60 μl of gel loading buffer, boiled, and 30 μl were loaded onto a gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Limited proteolysis was used to define stable fragments of α-catenin (25Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Incubation of full-length α-catenin with trypsin results in the accumulation of two fragments that encompass residues 82–287 and residues 385–651. The α-catenin 82–279 fragment constitutes the dimerization and β-catenin-binding region of α-catenin, whose structure and interactions with β-catenin were described previously (25Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The structure of α-catenin 385–651 was solved by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing and refined to 2.5-Å resolution (Table I). There are three copies of the molecule in the asymmetric unit, which are related by a 91oand a 112o rotation. The final model consists of residues 388–601 and 606–631 for copy A, residues 391–562, 566–597, and 607–631 for copy B, and residues 393–600 and 607–631 for copy C. Residues 632–651 are never observed, indicating that they are disordered, which is consistent with the presence of a tryptic cleavage site at residue 633 (27Yang J. Dokurno P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3645-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The structure of α-catenin 385–651 consists of two four-helix bundles that lie at a relative angle of ∼40° (Fig. 1 A). The first helix in the N-terminal four-helix bundle is shorter than the remaining three (11 residues compared with 26–30 residues). Residues preceding amino acid 396 turn away from the four-helix bundle, and residues 385–390 and 385–392 in copies B and C are not visible, indicating that this region is flexible. In both four-helix bundles, the third helix contains a proline residue, which causes a prominent kink. The proline in the C-terminal four-helix bundle additionally causes the turn preceding the proline to bulge (Fig. 1 A). The small interaction interface between the two four-helix bundles (varying between 464 and 697 Å2) appears to allow for flexibility between the two domains. In the three crystallographically independent views of the molecule, the relative orientation of the two subdomains differs by up to 14°. In the recently published structure of the α-catenin M-fragment (27Yang J. Dokurno P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3645-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), residues 377–633, the asymmetric unit contains two copies of the molecule; in both, the two domains assume an almost perpendicular orientation and their disposition with respect to each other varies by 10°. Comparison of the two crystal structures shows that the angle between the two bundles varies up to 56° (Fig. 1 B). The relative orientation of the two domains therefore exhibits a much wider range than expected from the single structures. The “closed” conformation seen in the present structure is stabilized by side by side interactions between the two four-helix bundles, whereas the “open” conformation seen in the M-fragment is stabilized by interactions between the bases of the four-helix bundles. In both the closed and the open conformations, the number of contacts between the two four-helix bundles is rather small, and the maximum surface area buried between the bundles is 697 and 680 Å2, respectively. α-Catenin 385–651 and the α-catenin M-fragment (27Yang J. Dokurno P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3645-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (residues 377–633) were crystallized under different conditions and in two different crystal forms. In each case there are multiple copies of the molecule in the asymmetric unit. The surface area buried between molecules is 866, 1788, and 2317 Å2 between copies A and C, A and B, and B and C, respectively, in the α-catenin 385–651 crystals. In the α-catenin 377–633 crystals, 1280 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area is buried in the non-crystallographic dimer interface. Although the dimers seen in the M-fragment crystals (27Yang J. Dokurno P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3645-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are formed by two molecules in the open conformation, modeling indicates that the dimer interactions would be possible in the closed conformation. Conversely, the trimers observed in the present crystals are formed by molecules in the closed conformation; molecules in the open conformation could not form the trimer interactions without steric clashes. To assess the possible relevance of the crystallographically observed oligomers, we examined the properties of the α-catenin 385–651 fragment in solution. Oligomerization of α-catenin 385–651 or 377–633 cannot be detected by gel filtration chromatography (data not shown; see also Ref. 27Yang J. Dokurno P. Tonks N.K. Barford D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3645-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, a small fraction of α-catenin"

Here, we show that lynx1 colocalizes with nAChRs on CNS neurons and physically associates with nAChRs. Single-channel recordings show that lynx1 promotes the largest of three current amplitudes elicited by ACh through alpha(4)beta(2) nAChRs and that lynx1 enhances desensitization. Macroscopic recordings quantify the enhancement of desensitization onset by lynx1 and further show that it slows recovery from desensitization and increases the EC(50). These experiments establish that direct interaction of lynx1 with nAChRs can result in a novel type of functional modulation and suggest that prototoxins may play important roles in vivo by modulating functional properties of their cognate CNS receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1987963824,"Previously, we reported that c-Myc is glycosylated by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine at Thr-58, a known phosphorylation site and a mutational hot spot in lymphomas. In this paper, we describe the production and characterization of two Thr-58 site-specific antibodies and use them to examine the modification of Thr-58 in living cells. One antibody specifically reacts with the Thr-58-glycosylated form of c-Myc, and the other reacts only with unmodified Thr-58 in c-Myc. Using these antibodies together with a commercial anti-Thr-58-phosphorylated c-Myc antibody, we simultaneously detected three forms of c-Myc (Thr-58-unmodified, -phosphorylated, and -glycosylated). It has been reported that Thr-58 phosphorylation is dependent on a prior phosphorylation of Ser-62. Mutagenesis of Ser-62 to Ala showed a marked decrease of Thr-58 phosphorylation and a marked increase of Thr-58 glycosylation. Growth inhibition of HL60 cells by serum starvation increases Thr-58 glycosylation and correspondingly decreases its phosphorylation. Serum stimulation has the opposite effect upon the modification status of Thr-58. A candidate kinase responsible for Thr-58 phosphorylation is the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Lithium, a competitive inhibitor of GSK3, decreased Thr-58 phosphorylation and increased its glycosylation. Finally, we show that the Thr-58-phosphorylated form of c-Myc predominantly accumulates in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus upon inhibition of proteasome activity. These data suggest that hierarchical phosphorylation of Ser-62 and Thr-58 and alternative glycosylation/phosphorylation of Thr-58 together regulate the myriad functions of c-Myc in cells.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Two regions of c-Myc required for its biological activities are the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD) and the C-terminal basic-HLHLZ-specific DNA-binding domain (2Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). The HLHLZ domain mediates heterodimerization of c-Myc with its partner, Max, permitting binding to specific DNA sequences (2Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 653-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). c-Myc activity is precisely controlled at various levels, including transcription, translation, and posttranslation (3Facchini L.M. Penn L.Z. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). c-Myc can be phosphorylated at more than a dozen Ser and Thr residues (3Facchini L.M. Penn L.Z. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Thr-58 and/or Ser-62 in the TAD has been shown to be particularly important for regulating transformation of cells by c-Myc (4Henriksson M. Bakardjiev A. Klein G. Luscher B.

It has also been shown recently that c-Myc turnover appears to be regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (6Flinn E.M. Busch C.M.C. Wright A.P.H. Mol. Cell.

Our previous studies showed that the TAD of c-Myc is also glycosylated by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) (13Chou T.-Y. Dang C.V. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and that Thr-58 is a major glycosylation site of c-Myc (14Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc is an abundant posttranslational modification of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins in eukaryotes (15Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Virtually all known O-GlcNAc-modified proteins are also phosphoproteins that form reversible multimeric protein complexes, suggesting that O-GlcNAc may regulate protein phosphorylation, protein-protein interaction, or both (16Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 17Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Thr-58 is also a known mutational hot spot in lymphomas, and this mutation is thought to be involved in tumor progression (1Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). This evidence led us to the hypothesis that alternative modification of Thr-58 by O-phosphate or O-GlcNAc regulates the c-Myc function differentially. Here we present evidence for the occurrence of both glycosylation and phosphorylation at Thr-58 in a cell line using both site- and modification state-specific antibodies. We also demonstrate the interplay between hierarchical phosphorylation of Ser-62/Thr-58 and alternative glycosylation/phosphorylation of Thr-58 in living cells. A mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (C-33) is from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody (B-5–1-2) is from Sigma. A rabbit anti-phospho-c-Myc(Thr-58/Ser-62) antibody is from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and we designated this as a phosphorylated Thr-58-specific antibody (α-T58P). To generate anti-glycosylated Thr-58 antibody (α-T58G) and anti-unmodified Thr-58 antibody (α-T58N), a synthetic glycosylated peptide (KKFELLP(T-O-GlcNAc)PPLSPSRR) and a synthetic peptide (KKFELLPTPPLSPSRR) corresponding to amino acids 51–66 in the human c-Myc protein were used as antigens. After five immunizations in BALB/c mice, cells from the popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were collected and fused with the P3X63Ag8.653 myeloma line according to the standard procedures. After the HAT selection, supernatants were screened for the reactivity with respective antigen. Confirmation of specificity was obtained by dot-blot analysis. Human embryonic kidney cell line 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) (heat inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min) at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2. Human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS. pRSV-c-myc, an expression vector containing the cDNA of human c-Myc2 (a kind gift of Dr. C. V. Dang, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine), was used for transfection. To prepare c-mycT58A and c-mycS62Amutant cDNAs, mutagenesis of pRSV-c-myc was performed with PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, synthetic DNA primers (5′-GAAATTCGAGCTGCTGCCCGCCCCGCCCCTGTC-3′ and 5′-GACAGGGGCGGGGCGGGCAGCAGCTCGAATTTC-3′ for c-mycT58A and 5′-CTGCTGCCCACCCCGCCCCTGGCCCCTAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTAGGGGCCAGGGGCGGGGTGGGCAGCAG-3′ for c-mycS62A) were used in the PCR with the template plasmid. For transfection of 293 cells, 1 × 106 cells were seeded in a 3.5-cm-diameter dish and grown for 24 h in DMEM-10% (v/v) FCS prior to transfection. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 70 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and diluted with 4 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm LiCl, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 × g, and the clarified supernatants were then incubated with the indicated antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (AmershamBiosciences) and washed extensively with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 250 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. For the detection of the proteins in Western blots, the immune complexes were suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated in 7.5% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and subjected to immunodetection using the appropriate primary antibody. Proteins were visualized by using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody or horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). To confirm O-GlcNAc-modification of the immunoprecipitated c-Myc, galactosyltransferase labeling with UDP-[3H]galactose was performed as described (18Roquemore E.P. Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot was first blocked in 4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9). The blot was then incubated overnight at room temperature with 1 ml of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 5 mm MnCl2, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 100 milliunit of bovine milk galactosyltransferase (Sigma), 0.5 μCi of UDP-[6-3H]galactose (Amersham Biosciences), and 100 milliunit of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The blot was washed extensively with 50 mmammonium formate containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 0.01% (w/v) NaN3, air-dried, and then exposed to x-ray firm using Enhanced autoradiography according to the manufacturer's instructions (EABiotech, Scotland, UK). 293 cells (1 × 106 cells) were cultured in the presence of 20 μmN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Norleu-al (ALLN, Sigma) for the indicated time and collected by scraping, and then cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared as described (20Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3913) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, collected cells were resuspended on ice in 800 μl of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm LiCl, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mm PMSF and incubated for 15 min. The suspension was added to 50 μl of 10% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and vigorously vortexed for 10 s. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 s. The supernatant was referred to as cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm LiCl, 0.5 mmMnCl2, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 mm PMSF and vigorously rocked at 4 °C for 15 min. The extract was centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was referred to as nuclear fraction. Thr-58 within the TAD of c-Myc has been independently identified as both a glycosylation (14Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and a phosphorylation site (21Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3216-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that there are three types of modifications at Thr-58 on c-Myc; unmodified, glycosylated, and phosphorylated. Although the phosphorylation status of Thr-58 has been studied extensively using an antibody specific for Thr-58-phosphorylated c-Myc (α-T58P) (12Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 22Noguchi K. Kitanaka C. Yamana H. Kokubu A. Mochizuki T. Kuchino Y. J. Biol.

Commun. 2001; 281: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), there has been little attention to the other forms. To detect all three c-Myc forms simultaneously, we have generated two monoclonal antibodies; one is specific for Thr-58-glycosylated c-Myc (α-T58G), and the other is specific for Thr-58-unmodified c-Myc (α-T58N). The specificity of each antibody is shown in Fig. 1. For the characterization of the antibodies, we used four forms of synthetic TAD peptides, which have different modification status including phosphorylation at Ser-62. Because it has been reported that Ser-62 on c-Myc is also a phosphorylation site (21Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3216-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of Ser-62 may affect recognition by the antibodies, we also tested immunoreactivity against the Ser-62-phosphorylated peptide. α-T58N recognizes both the unmodified and the Ser-62-phosphorylated peptide but not the other two forms (Fig. 1A), indicating that α-T58N is specific for Thr-58-unmodified c-Myc and that the Ser-62 phosphorylation status does not affect its specificity. Although the sensitivity of α-T58G is lower than that of the other antibodies, α-T58G specifically reacts with the Thr-58-glycosylated peptide but not the other three forms (Fig. 1A). The epitope for α-T58G seems to be a peptide in the TAD including O-GlcNAc-modified Thr-58 since it does not cross-react at all with several other synthetic O-GlcNAc-modified peptides we have prepared (19Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and the reaction between α-T58G and the Thr-58-glycosylated TAD peptide is not inhibited by 300 mm GlcNAc (data not shown). Moreover, α-T58G binds wild type c-Myc overexpressed in 293 cells but not with mutant c-MycT58A (Fig. 1B). It has been reported that c-Myc can be phosphorylated at more than a dozen Ser and Thr residues, including Ser-62 and Thr-58 (3Facchini L.M. Penn L.Z. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This evidence supports the occurrence of several bands or a broad band under PAGE. Glycosylation of c-Myc by O-GlcNAc in 293 cells was confirmed by galactosyltransferase labeling (Fig. 1C). Thus, we conclude that α-T58G is a Thr-58-glycosylated c-Myc-specific antibody. α-T58P reacts only with the Thr-58-phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 1A). Because it has also been reported that α-T58P recognizes c-Myc that is singly phosphorylated at Thr-58 and doubly phosphorylated at Thr-58 and Ser-62 but does not recognize c-Myc that is singly phosphorylated at Ser-62 or that is unmodified (12Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), we designate α-T58P as a Thr-58-phosphorylated c-Myc-specific antibody. Using these antibodies, we detected Thr-58 modification status of endogenous c-Myc in HL60 cells, which is possible because of high levels of the c-myc in HL60 cells (25Westin E.H. Wong-Staal F. Gelmann E.P. Favera R.D. Papas T.S. Lautenberger J.A. Eva A. Reddy E.P. Tronick S.R. Aaronson S.A. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2490-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). c-Myc in lysates were concentrated by immunoprecipitation with a general anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (C-33) and then visualized by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A, several bands were immunoreactive with C-33. In addition to multiple phosphorylation events as mentioned above, it has been reported that the c-myc gene gives rise to two major species of human c-Myc proteins: Myc1, with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa; and a 64-kDa protein, Myc2 (3Facchini L.M. Penn L.Z. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 633-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This evidence predicts the occurrence of several bands under PAGE. The bands immunoreactive with α-T58G were in a smeared pattern and were similar to those recognized by α-T58N but not by α-T58P (Fig. 2A, long exposure). The immunoreactivities of each α-T58 antibody upon serum stimulation were quantified and normalized to the levels of C-33 (total c-Myc), as shown in Fig. 2B. The population of α-T58P-immunoreactive bands increased upon serum stimulation, which is similar to the pattern of the major C-33-immunoreactive bands (Fig. 2A, short exposure, and 2B). Conversely, the population of α-T58G-immunoreactive bands were high in growth-arrested cells and decreased upon serum stimulation (Fig. 2A, long exposure, and 2B). The population of α-T58N-immunoreactive bands also tended to decrease upon serum stimulation albeit to a smaller extent. Although the stoichiometry of each α-T58 antibody-immunoreactive band could not be estimated because of the different sensitivity of each antibody for the detection of each c-Myc forms (Fig. 1), these results indicate that alternative glycosylation/phosphorylation occur at Thr-58 on c-Myc in cells. It has been reported that phosphorylation of Thr-58 is dependent on a prior phosphorylation of Ser-62 (26Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of Ser-62 phosphorylation on the modification status of Thr-58, we compared the modification status of wild type c-Myc and mutant c-MycS62A. Overexpressed c-Myc in the cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with C-33 and then visualized by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, a similar protein level of both c-Myc were detected by C-33. Wild type c-Myc immunoreacted strongly with α-T58P and weakly with both α-T58N and α-T58G. Interestingly, both α-T58N- and α-T58G-immunoreactivities of mutant c-MycS62A were strikingly higher than that of wild type c-Myc, and mutant c-MycS62A did not immunoreact with α-T58P at all. These results indicate that both the glycosylation and phosphorylation of Thr-58 are affected by Ser-62 phosphorylation status. A candidate kinase responsible for Thr-58 phosphorylation is GSK3 (4Henriksson M. Bakardjiev A. Klein G. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pulverer B.J. Fisher C.

It has been reported that lithium inhibits GSK3 activity (27Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar, 28Hong M.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of lithium on the modification status of Thr-58, wild type c-myc transiently transfected 293 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of LiCl. After treatment for 2 h, c-Myc was immunoprecipitated with C-33 and then visualized by Western blot. The results of a typical experiment are shown in Fig. 4A. The immunoreactivities of each α-T58 antibodies were quantified and normalized to the levels of C-33, as shown in Fig. 4B. A decrease of α-T58P-immunoreactivity was observed as a result of the lithium treatment (a maximal decrease of 0.6-fold). Interestingly, α-T58G-immunoreactivity increased inversely with the decrease of α-T58P-immunoreactivity (up to 1.8-fold). α-T58N-immunoreactivity also increased in these conditions (up to 1.7-fold). To further characterize the relationship between the two modifications, HL60 cells were treated with lithium or potassium under three different culture conditions that differentially affect the growth state of the cells. Endogenous c-Myc was immunoprecipitated with C-33 or α-T58G from the cells cultured in the presence of the indicated ion for 16 h and then visualized by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5, α-T58P immunoreactivity of c-Myc significantly decreased in the presence of lithium under all three culture conditions, and the lithium action was most significant when cells were stimulated with serum. Interestingly, α-T58G immunoreactivity of c-Myc increased in response to lithium when cells were stimulated with serum, indicating a reduction of Thr-58-phosphorylated c-Myc and a reciprocal increase of the Thr-58-glycosylated form. In the absence of lithium or potassium, serum stimulation causes a large increase in Thr-58 phosphorylation and a corresponding reproducible decrease in Thr-58 glycosylation (Figs. 2and 5 and data not shown). As it has been reported that potassium affects GSK3 activity (30Mora A. Sabio G. Gonzalez-Polo R.A. Cuenda A. Alessi D.R. Alonso J.C. Fuentes J.M. Soler G. Centeno F. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), potassium also had an effect on the Thr-58 modification status albeit to a smaller extent (Fig. 5). It has recently been reported that phosphorylation of Thr-58 is associated with degradation of c-Myc by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (12Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). To examine whether the modification status at Thr-58 is related to proteolysis or not, we tested the effect of proteasome inhibition on the Thr-58 modification status in 293 cells. Moreover, to characterize the localization of the accumulated c-Myc forms after the proteasome inhibitor treatment, biochemical subcellular fractionation was performed. Endogenous c-Myc was immunoprecipitated with C-33 and then visualized by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 6, c-Myc localized mainly in the nuclear fraction and a trace amount of c-Myc was also detectable in the cytoplasmic fraction at shorter times (both 0.2 and 2 h) after the addition of the proteasome inhibitor, ALLN. Because α-tubulin was detected only in the cytoplasmic fraction, we concluded that proper subcellular fractionation was achieved (Fig. 6). Interestingly, c-Myc accumulated largely in the cytoplasmic fraction rather than the nuclear fraction upon longer times of treatment of the cells with ALLN (both 4 and 8 h). Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with another proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (20 μm, data not shown). Finally, we found that the accumulated c-Myc in the cytoplasmic fraction is predominantly immunoreactive with α-T58P although all modification-specific α-T58 antibodies immunoreact with both the cytoplasmic and nuclear forms of c-Myc (Fig. 6). It is now well known that O-GlcNAc-modification sites resemble phosphorylation sites (15Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and in the case of some proteins including c-Myc (14Chou T.-Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18961-18965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), estrogen receptor β (31Cheng X. Cole R.N. Zaia J. Hart G.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11609-11620Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), SV-40 large T antigen (32Medina L. Grove K. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and eNOS (33Du X.L. Edelstein D. Dimmeler S., Ju, Q. Sui C. Brownlee M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate compete for the same site. In this study, using both site- and modification status-specific antibodies, we confirmed the occurrence of both O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate at Thr-58 on c-Myc in cell lines. We also characterized the Thr-58 modification status of c-Myc in living cells. Earlier study suggest that Thr-58 phosphorylation is dependent on the prior phosphorylation of Ser-62 (26Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Our data show that mutation of Ser-62 increases Thr-58 glycosylation and decreases Thr-58 phosphorylation, indicating that Thr-58 glycosylation occurs prior to its phosphorylation (Fig. 7). Earlier studies suggest that GSK3 is likely responsible for the phosphorylation of Thr-58 (4Henriksson M. Bakardjiev A. Klein G. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pulverer B.J. Fisher C. Vousden K. Littlewood T. Evan G. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 26Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and that lithium acts as an inhibitor of GSK3 (27Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar, 28Hong M. Chen D.C.R. Klein P.S. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25326-25332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). When cells were treated with lithium, we observed a decrease of Thr-58 phosphorylation and a corresponding increase of Thr-58 glycosylation. The increase of Thr-58-glycosylated c-Myc by lithium treatment appears to be a reciprocal action with respect to inhibition of GSK3-mediated phosphorylation. This idea is supported by earlier studies that have shown that pharmacological manipulation of the phosphorylation state of cells in turn dramatically affect the levels of O-GlcNAc in a reciprocal manner (34Haltiwanger R.S. Grove K. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3611-3617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar,35Griffith L.S. Schmitz B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because these lithium effects were most significant when cells are concomitantly stimulated with serum, O-GlcNAc modification at Thr-58 on c-Myc may play an important role in the early stage of mitogenic stimulation analogous to Ser-62 phosphorylation (Fig. 7). As reported earlier, Ser-62 phosphorylation is likely mediated by ERK (12Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) and/or cyclin-dependent kinase (36Hoang A.T. Lutterbach B. Lewis B.C. Yano T. Chou T.-Y. Barrett J.F. Raffeld M. Hann S.R. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4031-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Likewise, Thr-58 glycosylation/deglycosylation is likely catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase/O-GlcNAcase (37Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 38Lubas W.A. Frank D.W. Krause M. Hanover J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9838-9845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thus, the interplay between alternative glycosylation/phosphorylation of Thr-58 and hierarchical phosphorylation of Ser-62/Thr-58 might be regulated by these enzymes (Fig. 7). c-Myc is a highly unstable protein (40Hann S.R. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2486-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and proteolysis of c-Myc is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (6Flinn E.M. Busch C.M.C. Wright A.P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5961-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Gross-Mesilaty S. Reinstein E. Bercovich B. Tobias K.E. Schwartz A.L. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Proc.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 9Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that ubiquitinated c-Myc is phosphorylated at Thr-58 (12Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Although we could not identify the Thr-58 modification status of the ubiquitinated c-Myc, our data show that all three forms of Thr-58-modified, but predominantly Thr-58-phosphorylated form, are accumulated by proteasome inhibitor treatment. These results suggest that the major target of c-Myc for proteolysis is the Thr-58-phosphorylated form (Fig. 7) although Thr-58 phosphorylation is not always required for the proteolysis. This idea is not in conflict with the reports that degradation of c-Myc appears not to require Thr-58 phosphorylation in the absence of Ser-62 phosphorylation (12Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) and that there are no significant differences between c-MycT58A and wild type c-Myc regarding the ubiquitination level (24Noguchi K. Kokubu A. Kitanaka C. Ichijo H. Kuchino Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the turnover rate of c-Myc may be modulated by its modification status because it has been demonstrated that mutation of Thr-58 increases c-Myc stability (8Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 10Bahram F. von der Lehr N. Cetinkaya C. Larsson L.-G.

Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been proposed that O-GlcNAc/O-phosphate modulates proteasome-mediated proteolysis (41Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 42Cheng X. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10570-10575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We also observed a large accumulation of c-Myc in the cytoplasm by the proteasome inhibitor treatment, although in higher eukaryotic cells the proteasome is mainly localized both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (43Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar), and c-Myc is a nuclear protein. Our data suggest that the modification status of Thr-58 affects the translocation efficiency of c-Myc for the degradation system, which in turn affects the turnover rate of c-Myc. What are the role(s) of the Thr-58-modifications? Thr-58 is in the TAD and is the most frequently mutated amino acid in lymphomas (1Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Mutation of Thr-58 can enhance focus formation in a cotransformation assay with Ras (4Henriksson M. Bakardjiev A. Klein G. Luscher B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3199-3209PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pulverer B.J. Fisher C. Vousden K. Littlewood T. Evan G. Woodgett J.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar), although conflicting reports surround the effect of Thr-58 mutation in c-Myc transactivation activity (21Gupta S. Seth A. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3216-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Lutterbach B. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5510-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the biological activities of c-Myc are modulated by its interaction with other factors in addition to heterodimerization with Max (1Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar, 2Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

There are increasing numbers of proteins identified to interact with the c-Myc N terminus including the TAD, such as TATA box-binding protein, (47Maheswaran S. Lee H. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The alternative glycosylation/phosphorylation of Thr-58 and its interplay with Ser-62 phosphorylation may participate in regulating the formation of different functional complexes with these c-Myc-binding proteins. There are increasing numbers of putative c-Myc target genes related to various cellular functions including energy metabolism (1Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). Interestingly, glucose deprivation of c-Myc-overexpressing cells was found to induce extensive apoptosis, and that is thought to be linked to increased lactate dehydrogenase A expression (54Shim H. Chun Y.S. Lewis B.C. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1511-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).O-GlcNAc addition on proteins is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase and uses the substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, which is the end-product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (55Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway is strongly affected by intracellular glucose concentration (55Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the apoptotic feature of c-Myc-overexpressing cells by glucose deprivation may possibly be a consequence of an alteration of the O-GlcNAc/O-phosphate status of c-Myc including Thr-58. This idea is in agreement with a recent report that reciprocal modification by O-GlcNAc/O-phosphate of transcription factors, such as Sp1, may function as a mechanism for regulating glucose-responsive gene transcription (56Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (6982) Google Scholar). Thus, alternative glycosylation/phosphorylation are thought to be essential and functional modifications of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins in eukaryotes. It will be important to clarify the distinct roles of O-phosphate and O-GlcNAc at Thr-58 for the understanding of the myriad functions of c-Myc in cells. We are grateful to Dr. C. V. Dang for the kind gift of pRSV-c-myc. We thank all the members of the Hart laboratory for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2157619374,"Remyelination is a critical step for functional nerve regeneration. Here we show that fibrin deposition in the peripheral nervous system after injury is a key regulator of remyelination. After sciatic nerve crush, fibrin is deposited and its clearance correlates with remyelination. Fibrin induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and production of p75 NGF low-affinity receptor in Schwann cells and maintains them in a nonmyelinating state, suppresses fibronectin production, and prevents synthesis of myelin proteins. In mice depleted of fibrin(ogen), remyelination of myelinated axons is accelerated due to the faster transition of the Schwann cells to a myelinating state. Regulation of fibrin clearance and/or deposition could be a key regulatory mechanism for Schwann differentiation after nerve damage."

Electrophysiological studies of artificial bilayer-reconstituted mouse VDAC isoforms have shown subtly different channel properties, but they all display a slightly anionic-selective permeability of a wide variety of ions in the “open” state and a slightly cationic-selective permeability in the “closed” state (4Hodge T. Colombini M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 157: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Lack of the yeast VDAC (por1) leads to a temperature-sensitive growth restriction on a non-fermentable carbon source that, depending on which mammalian isoform is used, can be either completely or partially rescued (2Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18966-18973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), suggesting that each isoform has a discrete function. voltage-dependent anion channel cyclosporin A paired-pulse facilitation post-tetanic potentiation long term potentiation mitochondrial permeability transition excitatory postsynaptic potentials field EPSP There is considerable evidence that VDACs form the outer pore component of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore complex together with the adenine nucleotide transporter in the mitochondrial inner membrane and cyclophilin D in the matrix (6Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar,7Vyssokikh M.Y. Katz A. Rueck A. Wuensch C. Dorner A. Zorov D.B. Brdiczka D. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although previous research into the function of the MPT has focused on a pathological role in apoptosis and necrosis, more recent studies suggest that the MPT exists as a functional pore under a variety of physiological conditions (8Crompton M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 11-21Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 9Lemasters J.J. Qian T. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Cascio W.E. Trost L.C. Nishimura Y. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). For example, the MPT has been implicated in mitochondrial calcium-induced calcium release based upon the observation that the calcium release phase can be blocked by low doses of the MPT inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) (10Ichas F. Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 11Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8229-8237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High doses of cyclosporin A attenuate hippocampal long term depression, a long lasting form of synaptic plasticity that was attributed to the inhibition of calcineurin (also known as phosphatase 2B) (12Mulkey R.M. Endo S. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used a dose of cyclosporin 25-fold less in hippocampal slices to specifically target cyclophilin D, which is very sensitive to CsA (Ki = 3.1–3.6 nm for CsA) (13Connern C.P. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and our results are consistent with published studies of the effects of CsA on mitochondrial function. Approximately half of all presynaptic terminals in the rat hippocampal CA3→CA1 region contain at least one mitochondrion (14Shepherd G.M. Harris K.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8300-8310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the function of these complex organelles in learning and memory has yet to be determined. Several studies have reported the importance of ATP production (15Doolette D.J. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 30: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16Nguyen P.V. Marin L. Atwood H.L. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial calcium buffering (17David G. Barrett J.N. Barrett E.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 509: 59-65Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Sandoval M.E. Brain Res. 1980; 181: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in normal synaptic transmission, and mitochondria were recently demonstrated to be important in short term synaptic plasticity at the crayfish neuromuscular junction (19Tang Y. Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 483-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Participation of mitochondria in synaptic events ultimately depends on ion/metabolite flux through porins, the only known pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Using low doses of cyclosporin A and mice that lack the VDAC1 and/or the VDAC3 isoforms, we sought to determine the role of VDACs and the MPT in learning and synaptic plasticity. The gene targeting strategies for the VDAC1 and VDAC3 genes in embryonic stem cells has been described previously (5Wu S. Sampson M.J. Decker W.K. Craigen W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In brief, the VDAC1 targeting vector was designed to delete a 3.7-kb HindIII fragment containing exons 2–5 of the VDAC1 gene, including the translation initiation codon (2Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18966-18973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). After the generation of chimeras using standard techniques (20Bradley A. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1987: 113-151Google Scholar), genotyping of VDAC1 animals was performed using a four-primer multiplex PCR assay. The PCR primer sets used are (5′-3′): neomycin resistance gene-specific-primer, CTGCGAATCGGGAGCGGCGATACCG; wild-type-specific primer 1, GGCCAGGAATGGTAGCTCATGCC; wild-type-specific primer 2, GGATGGATCAGGGTAGATCAG; and wild-type-specific primer 3, GCTGTGCGCCACCCAGTGGTG. The PCR conditions were: 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min and 30 s, 40 cycles). The mutant allele PCR product (neo primer + primer 1) is 1.4 kb, and the wild-type PCR product (primer 2 + primer 3) is 700 bp. The generation and genotyping of VDAC3 mice has been described previously (21Sampson M.J. Decker W.K. Beaudet A.L. Ruitenbeek W. Armstrong D. Hicks M.J. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39206-39212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Mice deficient for both VDAC1 and VDAC3 were generated by mating VDAC1+/−/VDAC3+/−males to VDAC1−/−/VDAC3+/− females since VDAC1−/−/VDAC3+/− males are infertile. 2M. J. Sampson and W. J. Craigen, unpublished data. Prior to behavioral testing, we performed a series of control experiments to test for normal sensory signaling in VDAC-deficient mice in an attempt to exclude possible derangements of sensory or motor function as a cause of potential learning deficits. To assess sensory responsiveness to noxious stimuli, we performed the hot plate and shock threshold tests as described previously (22Weeber E.J. Atkins C.M. Selcher J.C. Varga A.W. Mirnikjoo B. Paylor R. Leitges M. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5906-5914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that VDAC-deficient mice exhibited normal sensory responsiveness to a 55 °C hot plate, as measured by hind paw-lick latency, and to shock threshold sensitivity tests, as measured by flinching, jumping, and vocalization to increasing shock intensities (data not shown). In two tests of motor function responsiveness, the open-field and rotor rod assessments, we found no significant difference in general activity or rotor rod performance of VDAC-deficient mice as compared with littermate wild-type controls (data not shown). This battery of standard behavior tests prevents the misinterpretation of hyperactivity or abnormal motor coordination as an apparent fear conditioning phenotype. Mice were housed on a 12-h light/dark schedule. All experiments were performed in compliance with the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and national regulations and policies. For cued and contextual fear conditioning, animals were placed in the fear conditioning apparatus for 2 min, and then a 30-s acoustic-conditioned stimulus (white noise) was delivered. During the last 2 s of the tone, a 1.5-mA shock (unconditioned stimulus) was applied to the floor grid. This protocol was repeated twice with 2 min between pairings. The stimulus strength and number of training pairs were chosen based on pilot experiments to optimize learning. To assess for contextual learning, the animals were placed back into the training context at 24 h post-training and scored for freezing for 5 min. To assess for cued learning, the animals were placed in a different context (novel odor, cage floor, and visual cues) 24 h after training. Baseline behavior was measured for 3 min in the novel context, and then the white noise was presented for 3 min. Learning was assessed by measuring freezing behavior (i.e. motionless position) every 5 s. The scorer of the behavioral experiments was blinded to animal genotypes. Spatial learning was performed in a Morris water maze consisting of a circular pool (1.38-m Nalge pool) filled with opaque water at room temperature. Mice were trained to locate an escape platform (15 cm × 15 cm) hidden beneath the water level (3 cm). Each mouse was given four trials per day for 8 consecutive days for which the time to find the platform (escape latency), the total distance traveled, and the swim speed of the animals were measured. Each animal was given a maximum of 50 s to find the platform. On days 7 and 8, mice were given a probe trial in which the platform was removed, and the animal was given 50 s to search the training pool for the platform. The time spent in each quadrant was recorded in addition to the number of times the animal crossed the area where the platform had been during the training sessions. Hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared as described previously (23Roberson E.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30436-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Hippocampal slices were bathed (1 ml/min) with artificial cerebral spinal fluid (125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.24 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm d-glucose, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm cyclosporin A as indicated) in an interface chamber maintained at either 25 or 30 °C. The Schaffer collateral synapse was stimulated, and the field EPSP (fEPSP) was recorded in area CA1 stratum radiatum. Responses were monitored for 20 min before paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), or long term potentiation (LTP) was induced to ensure a stable baseline. Measurements are shown as the average slope of the fEPSP from six individual traces and are standardized to 20 min of baseline recordings. Baseline stimulus intensities were adjusted to produce an fEPSP at 50% of the maximal response.N-methyl-d-aspartate-dependent LTP was induced with two sets of high frequency stimulation with each set consisting of two trains of 100 Hz of stimulation for 1 s, separated by 20 s. Stimulus intensities used for the high frequency stimulation were matched to that used in the baseline recordings. To minimize day-to-day variability in slice preparations and recordings, mutant and wild-type hippocampal slices were prepared simultaneously and placed side-by-side in the same recording chamber. Cyclosporin A was dissolved in 1 ml of 99% ethanol and added to stirring artificial cerebrospinal fluid over 10 min to increase solubilization; the cyclosporin/artificial cerebrospinal fluid was stirred throughout its use as well. Thorough washing of all plastic tubes and parts exposed to cyclosporin A with ethanol and water prevented contamination of control slices. To generate VDAC1−/− mice, gene targeting was used to delete exons 2–5. The mutated allele lacks four coding exons, removing the start codon and rendering the mRNA unstable. Heterozygous mice appear to have no obvious phenotype, but when mated, there is a reduced number of homozygous deficient mice as compared with the expected 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio, indicating partial embryonic lethality. When VDAC1+/− mice were intercrossed and the resulting offspring were genotyped, ∼40% of the expected number of VDAC1−/− mice and 88% of VDAC1+/−mice were identified (163+/+:286+/−:68−/−). Timed matings were used to demonstrate that embryonic death occurs between days 10.5 and 11.5 of gestation. 3M. J. Sampson, K. Anflous, and W. J. Craigen, unpublished data. Surviving VDAC1−/− mice are fertile, appear otherwise indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, and exhibit normal exercise tolerance. 4K. Anflous and W. J. Craigen, unpublished data. VDAC3−/− mice generated previously by gene targeting (21Sampson M.J. Decker W.K. Beaudet A.L. Ruitenbeek W. Armstrong D. Hicks M.J. Craigen W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39206-39212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) similarly harbor a null allele due to deletion of the last four exons of the gene, but all genotypes are born in expected numbers when heterozygous mice are mated. However, VDAC3−/− males are infertile due to structural abnormalities in the sperm tail leading to sperm immotility. Mice deficient for both VDAC1 and VDAC3 are born less frequently than would be expected and have a degree of growth retardation but otherwise appear healthy and long-lived. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the distribution of VDAC isoforms within regions of the mouse brain. Antibody staining of hippocampal sections from wild-type mice using anti-VDAC1 and anti-VDAC3-specific antibodies (24Decker W.K. Craigen W.J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 70: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) demonstrates that both isoforms are expressed in neurons of the hippocampus (Fig. 1). Staining can be seen in dentate, CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4 cells in addition to cells of the subiculum. Western blotting of total protein extracts from hippocampal brain slices confirms that both VDAC1 and VDAC3 are expressed at approximately equal amounts relative to an α-actin control antibody (Fig. 1 c). Examination of VDAC1−/− and VDAC3−/− mice revealed no obvious neuronal structural phenotype. Anatomical sections of brain tissue appear normal under light microscopy (not shown). To determine whether VDACs have a role in hippocampal dependent forms of learning and memory, we used fear conditioning to compare the learning/memory ability between VDAC-deficient mice and littermate controls. Associative fear-conditioned learning is performed by using an aversive stimulus (a mild foot shock) paired with an auditory-conditioned stimulus (white noise) within a novel environment. When presented with the auditory stimulus 2 min later, VDAC-deficient mice and control mice exhibit similar freezing behavior in anticipation of the aversive foot shock to follow (Fig. 2). However, when tested 24 h after training, control mice exhibit marked fear in response to re-presentation of either the context (Fig. 2,Contextual Fear Conditioning) or the auditory cue delivered in a different context (Fig. 2, Cued Fear Conditioning). VDAC3−/− mice, and VDAC1−/−/VDAC3−/− mice show a significant deficit in contextual fear conditioning. However, VDAC1−/− mice display freezing behavior indistinguishable from that of wild-type controls (Fig. 2). All of the VDAC-deficient mice show a significant cued fear conditioning deficit, a hippocampus-independent learning task (Fig. 2). Our observations indicate that VDAC3, but not VDAC1, is necessary for hippocampus-dependent contextual fear conditioning and implicate both VDAC1 and VDAC3 as necessary for cued fear conditioning. Given the effect of VDAC deficiency on contextual fear conditioning, we examined hippocampus-dependent spatial learning in VDAC-deficient mice using the hidden platform version of the Morris water maze. Following successive days of training, wild-type mice show a significant reduction in the time needed by the mouse to find the hidden platform (escape latency). In contrast, by day 6 of training, all VDAC-deficient mice showed a considerably greater latency than that of wild-type controls (Fig. 3) despite no significant difference in swim speed (data not shown). Following removal of the platform (probe test), VDAC-deficient mice did not preferentially spend more time in the trained quadrant or cross the trained site (Fig. 3). Only the wild-type mice exhibited a search strategy during probe test measurements, spending the majority of time in the appropriate quadrant. Therefore, VDAC1 and VDAC3 are necessary for normal spatial learning as assessed by the Morris water maze. Experimental evidence suggests a connection between short and long term synaptic plasticity and certain hippocampal learning tasks (25McKernan M.G. Shinnick-Gallagher P. Nature. 1997; 390: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the importance of VDACs in hippocampal short and long term plasticity. PPF, a short-lived form of plasticity believed to be involved in some forms of learning and memory (26Silva A.J. Rosahl T.W. Chapman P.F. Marowitz Z. Friedman E. Frankland P.W. Cestari V. Cioffi D. Sudhof T.C. Bourtchuladze R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1509-1518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), is widely regarded as a presynaptic phenomenon caused by residual calcium present in the presynaptic terminal following a depolarization that, in turn, facilitates neurotransmitter release in response to a second depolarization (27Wu L.G. Saggau P. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 645-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that hippocampal slices lacking VDAC3 show a significant reduction in PPF when the two depolarizations are within 100 ms of each other. Lack of VDAC1 results in normal PPF, and hippocampal slices deficient for both VDAC isoforms display the same deficit as VDAC3 deficiency (Fig. 4). PTP is another form of short term synaptic plasticity dependent on residual calcium (28Kamiya H. Zucker R.S. Nature. 1994; 371: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), but unlike PPF, PTP is elicited by a single high frequency depolarization that cause a much greater elevation of presynaptic calcium. When the MPT was demonstrated previously to be a conduit for mitochondrial calcium-induced calcium release (10Ichas F. Jouaville L.S. Mazat J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 1145-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that the residual calcium in the presynaptic terminal that underlies PTP involves mitochondrial calcium buffering. That idea was first tested by Tang and Zucker; in that report, tetraphenylphosphonium+, a lipophilic cation that depolarizes mitochondria, attenuates PTP (19Tang Y. Zucker R.S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 483-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). However, the concentration of TPP+ used in the study has been criticized as likely to cause significant mitochondrial swelling and dysfunction (29Nicholls D.G. Budd S.L. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Although mitochondrial calcium buffering may be involved in PTP, we found no significant reduction in PTP in any of the VDAC-deficient hippocampal slices (Fig. 4). Thus, our results indicate that neither VDAC1 nor VDAC3 is required for normal PTP. LTP, a long-lasting increase in the amplitude of synaptic response that has been correlated with many long-lasting forms of learning and memory (30Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar), is significantly impaired in VDAC1−/− slices and shows a trend toward impairment in VDAC3−/− slices. Lack of both isoforms causes a compounded effect of marked LTP attenuation (Fig. 4). Cyclosporin A (CsA) binds with high affinity to mitochondrial cyclophilin D and thereby prevents the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (6Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Slices exposed to 10 μm CsA exhibit attenuation in PPF and LTP that is strikingly similar to VDAC1−/−/VDAC3−/− slices and similarly show no deficit in PTP (Fig. 5) or alteration of baseline synaptic transmission (not shown). Calcineurin, a phosphatase inhibited by FK506 and high doses of cyclosporin A, has been shown to be involved in long term depression (12Mulkey R.M. Endo S. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 31Lu Y.M. Mansuy I.M. Kandel E.R. Roder J.

Cell. 2001; 107: 617-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) and in some forms of long term potentiation (33Onuma H. Lu Y.F. Tomizawa K. Moriwaki A. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Matsui H. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 30: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 34Lu Y.F. Hayashi Y. Moriwaki A. Tomizawa K. Matsui H. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 205: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to low dose CsA, FK506 does not affect induction of LTP by 100 Hz of high frequency stimulation used in this study (12Mulkey R.M. Endo S. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Also in contrast to low dose CsA, FK506 has no effect on presynaptic plasticity (35Funauchi M. Haruta H. Tsumoto T. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 19: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and enhances baseline synaptic transmission (36Wang J.H. Kelly P.T. Learn Mem. (Cold Spring Harb.). 1996; 3: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mice genetically lacking calcineurin have enhanced 100-Hz LTP and PPF (37Malleret G. Haditsch U. Genoux D. Jones M.W. Bliss T.V. Vanhoose A.M. Weitlauf C. Kandel E.R. Winder D.G. Mansuy I.M. Cell. 2001; 104: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), and mice overexpressing calcineurin have reduced PPF (38Winder D.G. Mansuy I.M. Osman M. Moallem T.M. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1998; 92: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Finally, although the absence of calcineurin does not impair hippocampal-dependent fear conditioning or spatial learning (32Zeng H. Chattarji S. Barbarosie M. Rondi-Reig L. Philpot B.D. Miyakawa T. Bear M.F. Tonegawa S. Cell. 2001; 107: 617-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), intracranial injections of low doses of cyclosporin A into day-old chicks disrupts memory formation (39Bennett P.C. Zhao W. Lawen A. Ng K.T. Brain Res. 1996; 730: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) by a calcineurin-independent mechanism (40Bennett P.C. Singaretnam L.G. Zhao W.Q. Lawen A. Ng K.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Taken together with our findings, these studies strongly suggest a different mechanism of action for low dose cyclosporin A. Considering the similarity of CsA exposure and VDAC1/3 absence on three forms of synaptic plasticity, our results are most consistent with a cyclosporin-mediated inhibition of the MPT. The results reported herein demonstrate that normal mitochondrial permeability is essential for learning and memory tasks. The molecular basis for these learning deficits appears unique to each VDAC isoform, as revealed by studies of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Although it is possible that the reduction in mitochondrial outer membrane permeability leads to developmental abnormalities in neuronal architecture, a pathological characterization of VDAC-deficient mice did not detect an anatomical defect despite the potential role of VDACs in apoptosis. In addition, VDAC-deficient mice do not display obvious abnormal behavior unrelated to learning, nor did they show a significant change in synaptic transmission. These observations, along with the finding that cyclosporin A can recapitulate the mutant phenotype in wild-type hippocampal slices, strongly suggest that the role of VDACs and the MPT in learning and synaptic plasticity is functional and dynamic rather than developmental in nature. The generation of a phenocopy of VDAC deficiency following treatment with a low concentration of cyclosporin A suggests that the dynamic function of VDACs in synaptic plasticity is related to its involvement in the MPT. Considering the role of the MPT in calcium regulation in isolated brain mitochondria, it is likely that the consequence of cyclosporin A exposure or absence of VDACs on mitochondrial calcium regulation in the presynaptic terminal is responsible for the effect on synaptic plasticity. Because the mitochondrion is located some distance away from the presynaptic membrane with respect to sites of calcium entry, mitochondrial calcium regulation is not likely to take place during or immediately following a synaptic depolarization but rather plays a more general role in controlling baseline calcium levels in the presynaptic terminal. Presynaptic background calcium may affect kinases involved in presynaptic plasticity that do not affect synaptic transmission, such as CAMKII (41Chapman P.F. Frenguelli B.G. Smith A. Chen C.M. Silva A.J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 591-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 42Zucker R.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Associative learning differences between the different VDAC-deficient mice further indicate that mitochondrial permeability serves distinct functions in different brain regions as highlighted by the finding that VDAC3, but not VDAC1, is necessary for hippocampus-dependent contextual fear conditioning. This suggests that VDACs play different roles in different mitochondrial populations, or alternatively, may reflect differences in the requirement for PPF and LTP in contextual learning. Interestingly, although the amygdala is important for both cued and contextual fear conditioning, VDAC1-deficient mice show an impairment only in cued fear conditioning. This may be due to the contribution of VDACs to individual nuclei within the amygdala. For example, the lateral amygdaloid nucleus receives auditory input involved in cued fear conditioning, whereas the basolateral and basomedial amygdaloid nuclei receive hippocampal afferents important for contextual fear conditioning (43Goosens K.A. Maren S. Learn Mem. (Cold Spring Harb.). 2001; 8: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The absence of VDAC1 may only affect the lateral amygdaloid nucleus, impairing cued fear conditioning but leaving contextual fear conditioning intact. Given the heterogeneous molecular basis for mitochondrial diseases, it remains uncertain whether there are common pathogenic mechanisms; however, there are numerous ways to induce the MPT, which may be a common final pathway for a variety of diseases (44Beal M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 45Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2615) Google Scholar). This is the first characterization of the role of mitochondrial VDACs and the MPT in learning and synaptic plasticity and the first analysis of the individual contributions of the VDAC1 and VDAC3 isoforms to learning and synaptic plasticity. The effect of cyclosporin A in recapitulating the phenotype supports the view that VDACs are a component of the MPT and provides further evidence for a physiological role for the MPT in learning and synaptic plasticity.

https://openalex.org/W2026671374,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) has recently received much attention as a potential drug target in type 2 diabetes. This has in particular been spurred by the finding that PTP1B knockout mice show increased insulin sensitivity and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Surprisingly, the highly homologous T cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) has received much less attention, and no x-ray structure has been provided. We have previously co-crystallized PTP1B with a number of low molecular weight inhibitors that inhibit TC-PTP with similar efficiency. Unexpectedly, we were not able to co-crystallize TC-PTP with the same set of inhibitors. This seems to be due to a multimerization process where residues 130–132, the DDQ loop, from one molecule is inserted into the active site of the neighboring molecule, resulting in a continuous string of interacting TC-PTP molecules. Importantly, despite the high degree of functional and structural similarity between TC-PTP and PTP1B, we have been able to identify areas close to the active site that might be addressed to develop selective inhibitors of each enzyme.

Unexpectedly, we were not able to co-crystallize TC-PTP with the same set of inhibitors. This seems to be due to a multimerization process where residues 130–132, the DDQ loop, from one molecule is inserted into the active site of the neighboring molecule, resulting in a continuous string of interacting TC-PTP molecules. Importantly, despite the high degree of functional and structural similarity between TC-PTP and PTP1B, we have been able to identify areas close to the active site that might be addressed to develop selective inhibitors of each enzyme. Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseTCT cell1The abbreviations used are: PTPprotein-tyrosine phosphataseTCT cell are key regulators of signal transduction processes (1Hunter T.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The family of classical PTPs can be divided into two broad categories as intracellular and receptor-like PTPs covering a total of 17 subtypes (3Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Receptor-like PTPs contain an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and one or two cytoplasmic PTP domains. Intracellular PTPs generally contain one PTP domain and an N- or C-terminal domain that targets the enzymes to specific subcellular localizations, as exemplified by the targeting of PTP1B to the endoplasmic reticulum (4Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.J. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). protein-tyrosine phosphatase T cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase T cell PTP1B and TC-PTP are two closely related intracellular enzymes. PTP1B was the first protein-tyrosine phosphatase to be identified and characterized (5Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6731-6737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6722-6730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Shortly after this landmark event, PTP1B was cloned from a placenta cDNA library (7Chernoff J. Schievella A.R. Jost C.A. Erikson R.L. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2735-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and TC-PTP was cloned from a peripheral human T cell cDNA library (8Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Walsh K.A. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5257-5261Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Despite its name, TC-PTP is ubiquitously expressed (9Ibarra-Sanchez M.D. Simoncic P.D. Nestel F.R. Duplay P. Lapp W.S. Tremblay M.L. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing gives rise to two forms of TC-PTP that differ in the C termini, a 45-kDa form that is targeted to the nucleus and a 48-kDa form that localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum via a hydrophobic C-terminal region (10Lorenzen J.A. Dadabay C.Y. Fischer E.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). TC-PTP is tightly regulated during the cell cycle and seems to play an important role in mitogenesis (9Ibarra-Sanchez M.D. Simoncic P.D. Nestel F.R. Duplay P. Lapp W.S. Tremblay M.L. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a recent study, it was shown that cellular stress causes reversible cytoplasmic accumulation of the 45-kDa form of TC-PTP (i.e. the nuclear form) (11Lam M.H.C. Michell B.J. Fodero-Tavoletti M.T.

Although they have a sequence identity of about 74% in the catalytic domains (see Fig. 1), TC-PTP and PTP1B clearly fulfill different biological functions, as has been demonstrated in knock-out mice. Thus, although PTP1B knock-out mice show increased insulin sensitivity and resistance to diet-induced obesity and are viable with a normal life span (12Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.-C. Ramachandaran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

In accordance with these in vivo observations, substrate trapping experiments have further shown that PTP1B and TC-PTP recognize different cellular targets (15Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 16Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At present it is not known to which degree this is due to different inherent substrate specificity that resides within the catalytic domains or to other regulatory mechanisms. For example, the activity and function of PTP1B can be regulated at different levels, including transcription (17Fukada T. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25512-25519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), alternative splicing (18Shifrin V.I. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25376-25384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), proteolytic processing (19Frangione J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and covalent modification (i.e. phosphorylation of specific residues such as Ser-50) (20Ravichandran L.V. Chen H. Li Y.H. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1768-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Likewise, as indicated above, alternative splicing may determine which substrates are recognized by TC-PTP (i.e. nuclear substrates by the 45-kDa form and cytoplasmic substrates by the 48-kDa form). However, by comparing substrates trapped with PTP1B and those trapped by targeting a TC-PTP/PTP1B chimera to the endoplasmic reticulum, Tonks and coworkers (16Tiganis T. Bennett A.M. Ravichandran K.S. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provide convincing evidence that at least part of the observed differences in substrate recognition capacity between the two enzymes is due to differences in intrinsic substrate specificity. Thus, fine structural differences not readily identifiable by primary sequence analyses may account for the observed differences in substrate recognition by PTP1B and TC-PTP. Similarly, elegant catalytic domain-swapping experiments of two other homologous PTPs, SHP-1 and SHP-2, clearly indicate that substantial substrate specificity may reside in the PTP domains (21Tenev T. Keilhack H. Tomic S. Stoyanov B. Stein-Gerlach M. Lammers R. Krivtsov A.V. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5966-5973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, areas outside the highly conserved regions surrounding the active sites may contribute to substrate binding (3Andersen J.N. Mortensen O.H. Peters G.H. Drake P.G. Iversen L.F. Olsen O.H. Jansen P.G. Andersen H.S. Tonks N.K. Moller N.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7117-7136Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Although the exact molecular mechanism(s) underlying the above phenotype of PTP1B knock-out mice still remains to be identified, these studies indicate that PTP1B could be an attractive drug target for treatment of type 2 diabetes. As a consequence, PTPs have caught the attention of the pharmaceutical industry (23Møller N.P.H. Iversen L.F. Andersen H.S. McCormack J.G. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2000; 3: 527-540PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, there is a rush for developing selective PTP1B inhibitors. We have recently used two different structure-based design approaches (attraction/repulsion and steric fit/steric hindrance) to develop selective PTP1B inhibitors (24Iversen L.F. Andersen H.S. Møller K.B. Olsen O.H. Peters G.H. Branner S. Mortensen S.B. Hansen T.K. Lau J., Ge, Y. Holsworth D.D. Newman M.J. Møller N.P.H.

Because PTP1B and TC-PTP are about 74% identical in the catalytic domains, it is anticipated that active site-directed PTP1B inhibitors might also bind to TC-PTP with equal potency. Indeed, we recently showed that two active site PTP inhibitors inhibited the two enzymes with almost identical potency. It is unclear if such potential cross-reactivity would be beneficial or perhaps cause adverse effects. Surprisingly, although PTP1B has been the focus of numerous structural studies (for an updated list of x-ray structures, see science.novonordisk.com/ptp), no x-ray structures have been reported for TC-PTP. Therefore, we decided to compare PTP1B and TC-PTP both at the functional and structural levels. Similar constructs of PTP1B and TC-PTP corresponding to the first 321 amino acid residues of the former were compared in (i) enzyme kinetic studies, (ii) inhibitor studies using a set of active site-directed PTP inhibitors, and (iii) by x-ray protein crystallography. Although as expected these studies showed very similar function and structure of the two enzymes, our analysis also indicates that they are sufficiently different to allow a structure-based design of inhibitors that are selective for either of them. PTP1B 1–321 and TC-PTP 1–314 were cloned, expressed, and purified essentially as described previously (24Iversen L.F. Andersen H.S. Møller K.B. Olsen O.H. Peters G.H. Branner S. Mortensen S.B.

The cDNAs encoding these PTPs were obtained by polymerase chain reaction using primers with convenient cloning sites and appropriate cDNA templates. The coding sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The constructs were inserted into the pET11a expression vector, and PTP1B and TC-PTP were expressed essentially as described previously (26Andersen H.S. Iversen L.F. Jeppesen C.B. Branner S.

In brief, compound 4, which is a selective PTP1B/TC-PTP inhibitor (see Fig. 2), was coupled to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions (100 mg of compound 4/g of drained column material). Lysates from Escherichia coli producing PTP1B and TC-PTP were cleared by centrifugation and applied to the column. The enzymes were eluted by a combined pH (6.2–9.0) and salt gradient (0.1–1.0 m NaCl), resulting in ∼90% pure preparations. The final polishing consists of an anion exchange purification step (Mono-Q, Amersham Biosciences). Before crystallization, buffer exchange (see below under “Crystallization”) was performed using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Further experimental details will be published elsewhere. The phosphatase activity was determined using p- nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate essentially as described (24Iversen L.F. Andersen H.S. Møller K.B. Olsen O.H. Peters G.H. Branner S. Mortensen S.B.

Inhibition is expressed as Ki values in μm. The reported S.D. are calculated from at least three independent experiments. An ∼10 mg/ml TC-PTP in 10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 3 mm dithiothreitol was used for crystallization. Crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Two μl of TC-PTP solution were mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution consisting of 0.05–0.25 m Hepes buffer, pH 8.0, 0.2 mmagnesium acetate, 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The reservoir volume was 1 ml. Crystals grew to the size of 0.5 × 0.3 × 0.1 mm over approximately 1 week, and three or more weeks in total were used for crystal growth. Data were collected using a Mar345 image plate detector on a rotating anode (RU300, CuKα 50 kV/100 mA) equipped with Osmic multilayer mirror system. The data collection was performed on a single crystal at room temperature. A data set to 2.53-Å resolution was obtained. Data processing was performed using Denzo, Scalepack, and the CCP4 program suite (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar, 32Collaborative Computational Project, N. 4., Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 50, 1994, 760–763Google Scholar). From autoindexing and the systematic absent reflections, the space group was determined to be P41212 or P43212 with cell dimensions a =b = 60.5 Å and c = 187.6 Å. The Vm was calculated to be 2.3 Å3/dalton with a TC-PTP monomer in asymmetric unit (Vm = 2.4 Å3/dalton for the average protein crystal). A molecular replacement solution was found using Amore (33Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) and PTP1B (Protein Data Bank code 1C88) as a search model (ligand and water molecules were omitted from the structure). The search was performed in both P41212 and P43212, with the correct solution identified in P43212. All refinements were performed using CNX version 2000 (Accelrys). Interchanging cycles of model building using X-build (Accelrys) and refinement were performed. To avoid phase bias from the molecular replacement search model, 5% of the amplitudes were omitted from the refinements and used for R-free calculations, and the lowering of R-free was monitored during all refinements. Water molecules were inserted using the X-solvate program (Accelrys). The graphical interface used was Quanta (Accelrys).

The 1–321 PTP1B construct is the best characterized enzyme domain within the PTP family, and its activity and structure have been studied in numerous reports since its original identification and cloning. Therefore, to compare directly with this gold standard in the PTP field we decided to clone and express the similar construct of TC-PTP,i.e. residues 1–314. The sequence identity between the catalytic domains of TC-PTP and PTP1B is 74% (Fig. 1) with the major differences clustered in four stretches of amino acid residues, (i) 1–35, (ii) 129–148, (iii) 158–174, (iv) 235–246 (TC-PTP numbering is used). To compare PTP1B and TC-PTP at the functional level, we first determined the steady state kinetic parameters,kcat and Km for each enzyme using p- nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. As shown in Table II, the catalytic efficiencies of these two enzymes are almost identical, thus providing an initial indication that the high degree of primary sequence identity also translates into a high degree of similarity at the structural and functional levels.Table IIKinetic constants for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate at pH 6.5 and 25 °CEnzymekcatKmkcat/Km× 10−3s−1mms−1 m−1PTP1B51.2 ± 2.00.47 ± 0.02109.5TC PTP53.9 ± 1.80.48 ± 0.03113.2 Open table in a new tab We next probed the active site cavities of the two enzymes with a set of PTP inhibitors. We have previously shown that 2-(oxalylamino)-benzoic acid (Fig. 2, compound 1) is a general PTP inhibitor with the two carboxyl groups interacting with conserved residues in the active sites of these enzymes (26Andersen H.S. Iversen L.F. Jeppesen C.B. Branner S. Norris K. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7101-7108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Of note in the present context, we also found that an additional ring system could dramatically change the inhibitory profiles of these compounds. Thus, although the naphthyl-based compound 2 is a relatively potent inhibitor of PTP-LAR at pH 5.5, the indole-based compound3 is a poor inhibitor of this enzyme. Conversely, compound3 is a relatively potent inhibitor of SHP-1, whereas compound 2 is about 3-fold less potent. Accordingly, this shows that even very close to the active site, structural differences among PTPs can be detected with these low molecular weight inhibitors. As shown in Table III, only minor differences could be demonstrated when compounds 1–4 were analyzed for inhibitory activity against PTP1B and TC-PTP. This is in agreement with our recent findings where two pyran-based inhibitors were found to inhibit these two enzymes with similar efficiency (24Iversen L.F. Andersen H.S. Møller K.B. Olsen O.H. Peters G.H. Branner S. Mortensen S.B. Hansen T.K. Lau J., Ge, Y. Holsworth D.D. Newman M.J. Møller N.P.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14812-14820Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that, from a functional point of view, the catalytic clefts of PTP1B and TC-PTP are very similar.Table IIIInhibition constants (K1 values in μm)EnzymesCompound 1Compound 2Compound 3Compound 4PTP1B34.0 ± 1.17.3 ± 0.619.3 ± 0.61.01 ± 0.04TC PTP39.8 ± 1.67.5 ± 0.520.2 ± 0.61.47 ± 0.21 Open table in a new tab Although the above enzyme kinetic characterization and inhibitor studies as well as molecular modeling (not shown) clearly indicate that the catalytic domains of PTP1B and TC-PTP must be very similar, protein x-ray crystallography is needed for unequivocal structural comparison of the two enzymes. We first attempted to co-crystallize TC-PTP with several of the above ligands that were found to inhibit PTP1B and TC-PTP with similar potency and for which several x-ray PTP1B-inhibitor complex structures have been reported (24Iversen L.F.

However, to our surprise and for reasons that will be discussed below, we were not able to obtain any crystals of TC-PTP complexed with any of these inhibitors. Therefore, we turned our attention to the uncomplexed version and obtained the apo structure. Residues 5–277 of TC-PTP were identified and built into the electron density maps. The final structure contains two disordered loops, 117–121 and 236–242, with only backbone atoms traceable in the 2 Fo − Fc electron density maps. Cys-94 and Cys-95 both contained covalently bound β-mercaptoethanol (used as a reducing agent during purification and crystallization). Forty water molecules were inserted during refinements. The WPD loop of TC-PTP was found in an open conformation. Thus, all structural comparisons with PTP1B are based on the apo form of PTP1B (Protein Data Bank code 2HNP). Overall, no differences were identified in the secondary or tertiary structures between TC-PTP and PTP1B. Minor differences are observed in loop areas between the two structures (see Fig. 3). The root mean square deviation between the TC-PTP and PTP1B structure (for all equivalent atoms) is 1.82 Å (calculated using Quanta). Our lack of success in co-crystallizing TC-PTP with inhibitors is most likely explained by unusual crystal packing along the 21 axis (space group P43212) involving the active site pocket and surrounding residues. A loop corresponding to residues 130–132, the “DDQ loop,” from one molecule was inserted in the active site of a neighboring molecule, resulting in a continuous row of TC-PTP molecules (Fig. 4 a). The active site blockage is not limited to the DDQ loop but involves a total surface area of 1183 Å2, with 892 Å2 of hydrophilic and 291 Å2 of hydrophobic nature. Residues 129–133, 135, 145–148, 150, 155, 158, and 176 on one molecule form a surface patch (inhibiting patch) that interacts with the active site on the neighboring molecule (residues 43, 48–50, 120–121, 183–184, 216–222, 260, and 264); see Fig. 4 b. The binding of the inhibitory patch is further stabilized by several hydrogen-bonding water molecules (see Fig. 5, a and b). Generally speaking, the surface loop consisting of residues 129–135 and the outermost β-strand flanking the central β-sheet of PTPs, including residues 145–150, define the major part of the inhibitor patch.Figure 5The DDQ loop binding motif. a, binding of Asp-131 from the DDQ loop (from one TC-PTP molecule) and two water molecules to the active site pocket P loop and Gln-260 (of a neighboring molecule).

Both of the carboxylic acid groups of Asp-130 and Asp-131 from the DDQ loop hydrogen bonds to the amine side chain group of Gln-260. Furthermore, the side chain of Asp-131 interacts with the P loop via two hydrogen-bonding water molecules (see details below). The amine of Gln-132 hydrogen bonds to the amine ofGln-264. As indicated, a number of van der Waals contacts stabilize the complex formation as follows. (i) the Cβ atom of Thr-129 interacts with the Cβ and Cγ side chain atoms ofAsp-50; (ii) the Glu-133 Cγ atom interacts with the Cβ atom of Phe-183; (iii) Leu-135 interacts with Phe-183; (iv) Leu-145 interacts withTyr-48; (v) Leu-146 interacts withVal-121; (vi) Val-150 interacts with the Cγ and Cδ atoms of both Arg-43 and Arg-49; and finally (vii) Leu-158 is in van der Waals contact with the Cβ ofSer-120. Furthermore, the side chain hydroxyl group of Ser-147 is in hydrogen bond contact with the backbone carbonyl group of Ser-120, and Glu-148 hydrogen bonds to the backbone nitrogen of Arg-49 as well as to a water molecule that further hydrogen bonds to the backbone nitrogens of both Arg-49 and Asp-50. Finally, the side chains of Thr-155 and His-176 (via a water molecule) hydrogen bond with the guanidinium group of Arg-49. As described, Asp-131 is positioned into the active site cleft of TC-PTP. However, the carboxylic acid group is not in direct contact with the P loop as previously seen for charged ligands in the active site pocket of PTPs (24Iversen L.F. Andersen H.S. Møller K.B.

https://openalex.org/W2094511701,"Dentate gyrus granule cells innervate inhibitory interneurons via a continuum of synapses comprised of either Ca(2+)-impermeable (CI) or Ca(2+)-permeable (CP) AMPA receptors. Synapses at the extreme ends of this continuum engage distinct postsynaptic responses, with activity at CI synapses being strongly influenced by NMDA receptor activation. NMDARs at CI synapses have a lower NR2B subunit composition and a higher open probability, which generate larger amplitude and more rapid EPSCs than their CP counterparts. A novel form of NMDAR-dependent long-term depression (iLTD) is associated with CI-mossy fiber synapses, whereas iLTD at CP synapses is dependent on Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor activation. Induction of both forms of iLTD required elevation of postsynaptic calcium. Thus mossy fibers engage CA3 interneurons via multiple synapse types that will act to expand the computational repertoire of the mossy fiber-CA3 network."

In whole-cell recordings from pairs of AII amacrine cells in a slice preparation of the rat retina, bidirectional, nonrectifying electrical coupling was observed in all pairs with overlapping dendritic trees (average conductance approximately 700 pS). Coupling displayed characteristics of a low-pass filter, with no evidence for amplification of spike-evoked electrical postsynaptic potentials by active conductances. Coincidence detection, as well as precise temporal synchronization of subthreshold membrane potential oscillations and TTX-sensitive spiking, was commonly observed. These results indicate a unique mode of operation and integrative capability of the network of AII amacrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W2037827891,"The mechanisms that underlie axonal pathfinding of vomeronasal neurons from the vomeronasal organ (VNO) in the periphery to select glomeruli in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) are not well understood. Neuropilin-2, a receptor for secreted semaphorins, is expressed in V1R- and V3R-expressing, but not V2R-expressing, postnatal vomeronasal neurons. Analysis of the vomeronasal nerve in neuropilin-2 (npn-2) mutant mice reveals pathfinding defects at multiple choice points. Vomeronasal sensory axons are severely defasciculated and a subset innervates the main olfactory bulb (MOB). While most axons of V1R-expressing neurons reach the AOB and converge into distinct glomeruli in stereotypic locations, they are no longer restricted to their normal anterior AOB target zone. Thus, Npn-2 and candidate pheromone receptors play distinct and complementary roles in promoting the wiring and patterning of sensory neurons in the accessory olfactory system."

To analyze neural signals that underlie striatal plasticity, we recorded from an identifiable class of striatal interneurons as macaque monkeys underwent training in a range of conditioning and non-associative learning paradigms, and recorded eyeblink electromyographs as the measure of behavioral response. We found that the responses of these striatal interneurons were modifiable under all training conditions and that their population responses were tightly correlated with the probability that a given stimulus would evoke a behavioral response. Such a network signal, proportional to current response probability, could be crucial to the learning and decision functions of the basal ganglia."

The checkpoint proteins hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 have limited homology to the replication processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and hRad17 has homology to replication factor C (RFC). Such observations have led to the proposal that these checkpoint Rad proteins may function similarly to their replication counterparts during checkpoint control. We purified two complexes formed by the checkpoint Rad proteins and investigated their structures using an electron microscopic preparative method in which the complexes are sprayed from a glycerol solution onto very thin carbon foils, decoratedin vacuo with tungsten, and imaged at low voltage. We found that the hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1 proteins make a trimeric ring structure (checkpoint 9-1-1 complex) reminiscent of the PCNA ring. Similarly we found that hRad17 makes a heteropentameric complex with the four RFC small subunits (hRad17-RFC) with a deep groove or cleft and is similar to the RFC clamp loader. Therefore, our results demonstrate structural similarity between the checkpoint Rad complexes and the PCNA and RFC replication factors and thus provide further support for models proposing analogous functions for these complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2139592302,"Can brain activity reveal a covert choice? Making a choice often evokes distinct emotions that accompany decision processes. Amygdala has been implicated in choice behavior that is guided by a prospective negative outcome. However, its specific involvement in emotional versus cognitive processing of choice behavior has been a subject of controversy. In this study, the human amygdala was monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects were playing in a naturalistic choice paradigm against the experimenter. In order to win, players had to occasionally choose to bluff their opponent, risk ""getting caught,"" and suffer a loss. A critical period, when choice has been made but outcome was still unknown, activated the amygdala preferentially following the choice that entailed risk of loss. Thus, the response of the amygdala differentiated between subject's covert choice of either playing fair or foul. These results support a role of the amygdala in choice behavior, both in the appraisal of inherent value of choice and the signaling of prospective negative outcomes."

Cardiac development is believed to be regulated cooperatively by a variety of proteins, including signaling molecules (e.g. fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, ErbB2/B4, neuregulin, etc.), cell adhesion molecules (e.g. vascular cell adhesion molecule, α4 integrin, and versican), ion channels, and transcription factors (e.g. GATA, myocyte enhancer factor-2, HAND, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II, Nkx2.5, TBX5, NF-ATc, Smad6, Pax3, retinoid X receptor/retinoic acid receptor, TEF-1, WT-1, etc.) (7Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 407: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CRT gene expression is known to be regulated by a transcription factor (Nkx2.5) that is involved in the regulation of gene expression for cardiac development (8Guo L. Lynch J.

Recently, it has been shown that CRT is essential for cardiac and neural development in mice (9Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J.

Cell Res. 2000; 256: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). CRT-deficient embryonic cells show impaired nuclear import of the transcription factor NF-AT3 (nuclear factor of activated T cells), indicating that CRT functions in cardiac development as a component of the Ca2+/calcineurin/NF-AT/GATA-4 transcription pathway (9Mesaeli N. Nakamura K. Zvaritch E. Dickie P. Dziak E. Krause K.-H. Opas M. MacLennan D.H. Michalak M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Very recently, it has also been reported that CRT transgenic mice suffer complete heart block and sudden death (11Nakamura K. Robertson M. Liu G. Dickie P. Nakamura K. Guo J.Q. Duff H.J. Opas M. Kavanagh K. Michalak M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In that study, it was described that CRT-dependent cardiac block involves impairment of both the L-type Ca2+ channel and gap junction connexin-40 and connexin-43. Also observed was a decrease in phosphorylated connexin-43 in CRT transgenic heart, suggesting that the functions of protein kinases are altered via the regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis. The study indicates that overexpression of CRT affects not the morphogenesis, but the physiological function of cardiomyoblasts. The overall mechanism of the dephosphorylation of connexin-43 in CRT transgenic heart cells is not known, but may involve the altered regulation of protein kinase pathways. These studies suggest that CRT plays a vital role in cardiac differentiation and function, although how has not been fully clarified. In this study, we investigated the biological role of CRT using rat cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells transfected with the CRT gene. We show that overexpression of CRT promotes apoptosis during cardiac differentiation and that suppression of protein kinase B/Akt signaling for cell survival is involved in the apoptotic process. We also show that expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, is involved in altering the regulation of Akt signaling in H9c2 cells overexpressing CRT via the regulation of Ca2+homeostasis. Antibodies against CRT, calnexin, and Grp78/BiP were purchased from Stressgen Biotech Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). The antibody against the protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α) catalytic subunit (PP1αc) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-Akt and anti-phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against PP2B-Aα (calcineurin) and PP2Cα were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-PP2A catalytic subunit α (PP2Acα) antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The reagents used in the study were all high grade and were from Sigma or Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). H9c2 cells, a clonal line derived from embryonic rat heart (12Kimes B.W. Brandt B.L. Exp.

Res. 1991; 69: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1446). H9c2 cells and the CRT gene-transfected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Before reaching confluence, the cells were split, plated at low density in culture dishes containing 10% FCS culture medium, and cultured for 24 h. To induce cardiac differentiation, cells were then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS and 10 nmall-trans-retinoic acid (RA) according to the method described by Ménard et al. (14Ménard C. Pupier S. Mornet D. Kitzmann M. Nargeot J. Lory P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29063-29070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The culture medium was replaced every 2 days. A full-length mouse CRT cDNA was cloned from total RNA of mouse monocyte-derived leukemia RAW264.7 cells by reverse transcription-PCR using SuperScript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Advantage-HF2 Taq polymerase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with the following primer pair, which was designed on the basis of reported nucleotide sequences (15Smith M.J. Koch G.L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar): Primer S, CCATGCTCCTTTCGGTGCCG; and Primer A, GTGGCCTCTACAGCTCATCC. The amplified DNA fragments were subcloned into a TA cloning vector (pCRII, Invitrogen), and the nucleotide sequences of the PCR product were confirmed by sequencing with an ALFexpress II system (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The CRT cDNA was cloned into plasmid pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter for expression in mammalian cells. The mock and CRT gene expression vectors were transfected into H9c2 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable transfectants were screened by culturing with 500 μg/ml G418. The cloned G418-resistant lines were then screened for expression of CRT. Two cell lines (CRT-S2 and CRT-S8) found to express high levels of CRT upon immunoblot analysis (see Fig. 1 A) were selected and used for the experiments. Cells (5 × 104/ml) were grown on Lab-Tek chamber slides for 24 h. They were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) and permeabilized for 10 min with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, incubated with anti-CRT or anti-calnexin antibody for 1 h, and washed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The immunoreactive primary antibody was visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Cappel). After washing, the stained cells were mounted in Vectashield medium. A Zeiss Axioskop2 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with epi-illumination for fluorescence was used for fluorescence microscopic analysis. The proliferation of cultured cells was evaluated by measuring attached live cells photometrically after staining with crystal violet. The cells (3000) were placed in 100 μl of medium/well in 96-well plates and cultured with or without the differentiation treatment. After a specific period, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed, and stained with 0.01% crystal violet at room temperature for 20 min. Each well was extensively washed with water and dried. The stained cells were lysed by adding 100 μl of lysis buffer (20% SDS and 50%N, N-dimethylformamide (pH 4.7)), and the cell number was then estimated by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm using a microplate reader. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry with the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method (16Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Benn-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9145) Google Scholar) using an ApopTag Plus fluorescein in situ apoptosis detection kit (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY). Briefly, cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol, treated with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase for 1 h and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Fluorescence intensity was measured at 530 nm using a flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). Apoptosis was also measured by flow cytometry as described (17Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Gringnani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4421) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. The DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry. Hypodiploid cells containing a smaller amount of DNA and a side scatter higher than that of G0/G1 cells were considered to be apoptotic. Caspase-3 activity was assayed by spectrophotometric detection of the chromophore p-nitroanilide after cleavage from the substrate DEVD-p-nitroanilide using a CPP32/caspase-3 colorimetric protease assay kit (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan). The p-nitroanilide light emission was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Cultured cells were harvested and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 130 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride including protease inhibitors (20 μm amidinophenyl methanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm pepstatin, and 50 μm leupeptin)). The supernatants obtained on centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min then were used in subsequent experiments. Protein samples were electrophoresed on 7.5, 10, or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane as described (18Ihara Y. Sakamoto Y. Mihara M. Shimizu K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9629-9634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin or 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.15 m NaCl) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h with the primary antibody in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. The blots were coupled with the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed, and then developed using the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Akt activity was assayed using an Akt assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, Akt was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-Akt antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in an assay mixture containing an Akt substrate, GSK-3α/β fusion protein. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane to detect phosphorylated GSK-3α/β using anti-phosphorylated GSK-3α/β (Ser21/9) antibody. The full-length rat PP1αc and PP2Acα cDNAs were generously provided by Dr. Kunimi Kikuchi (Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan) (19Kitamura K. Mizuno Y. Sasaki A. Yasui A. Tsuiki S. Kikuchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 307-310PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kitagawa Y. Tahira T. Ikeda I. Kikuchi K. Tsuiki S. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 951: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A PstI-SmaI fragment of 600 bp and an EcoRI-PvuII fragment of 680 bp were prepared from the cDNAs of PP1αc and PP2Acα, respectively, and used as cDNA probes. The probes were radiolabeled with 32P using a random primer labeling kit (Takara Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan). The isolation of cytoplasmic RNA and Northern blotting were essentially performed as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7-39Google Scholar). Isolated RNAs (10 μg) were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.6m formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane, and then hybridized with 32P-labeled probes. Autoradiographed membranes were analyzed using a BAS5000 bioimage analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). Ser/Thr protein phosphatase activity was assayed photometrically using a Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit (kit 1, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The phosphopeptide RKpTIRR and p-nitrophenyl phosphate were used as phosphatase substrates. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). The intracellular free calcium concentration was measured using fura-2 essentially as described previously (22Chen Q. Jones T.W. Stevens J.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 161: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured on glass coverslips were loaded with 5 μm fura-2/AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) for 20 min in Earle's balanced salt solution in the presence of 0.01% pluronic F-127. After four washes with Earle's balanced salt solution, the coverslip was positioned in a quartz cuvette containing 3.5 ml of fresh Earle's balanced salt solution at a 45° angle to both the excitation and emission light paths. The fura-2 fluorescence was determined at 37 °C using a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer operating at an emission wavelength of 505 nm with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. The maximal signal (Rmax) was obtained by adding ionomycin at a final concentration of 4 μm. Then, the minimal signal (Rmin) was obtained by adding EGTA at a final concentration of 7.5 mm, followed by Tris-free base at a final concentration of 30 mm, to increase the pH to 8.3.R is the ratio (F1/F2) of the fluorescence of Ex340 nm/Em505 nm (F1) to that of Ex380 nm/Em505 nm (F2). The actual calcium concentration was calculated as Kd × (R −Rmin)/(Rmax −R), with Kd equal to 224 nm(23Grynkiewcz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the functional roles of CRT during cardiac differentiation, a CRT gene expression vector was constructed and transfected into rat cardiomyoblast H9c2 cells. After the screening of G418-resistant transfectants, the expression level of CRT was characterized immunologically. Two high expression transfectants (CRT-S2 and CRT-S8) were used in subsequent experiments. Fig. 1 A shows that expression of CRT increased in the overexpressers to ∼2.7-fold the level in the parental and mock-transfected (control) H9c2 cells. Transfection had no apparent effect on expression of other ER chaperones such as calnexin and BiP. The intracellular localization of CRT was examined by indirect immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig. 1 B, immunoreactive signals showed a perinuclear reticular pattern in all cases, including the control and gene-transfected cells, although the signal intensity was increased in the transfectants compared with the control cells. Under non-permeabilized conditions, no significant increase in CRT expression on the cell surface was observed in the gene-transfected cells (data not shown). In the case of calnexin, the transfectants were similar to controls in the localization and intensity of immunoreactive signals. The H9c2 cell acquires the cardiac phenotype under conditions of retinoic acid-induced differentiation (14Ménard C. Pupier S. Mornet D. Kitzmann M. Nargeot J. Lory P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29063-29070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To test the effect of overexpressed CRT on cardiac differentiation, control and gene-transfected H9c2 cells were cultured with or without differentiation medium (1% FCS and 10 nm RA in DMEM), and cell proliferation and morphology were compared. As shown in Fig. 2 A, after 5 days of culture in differentiation medium, cell proliferation was suppressed in control cells, but was only reduced in the transfectants. Cardiac differentiation was confirmed as described by Ménard et al. (14Ménard C. Pupier S. Mornet D. Kitzmann M. Nargeot J. Lory P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29063-29070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) by suppression of cell proliferation and increase in expression of specific differentiation markers such as L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel α1C and myosin heavy chain by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Under normal culture conditions, cell proliferation in the gene transfectants was relatively reduced compared with the control cells. Fig. 2 B shows that after 5 days of culture in differentiation medium, large and round differentiated cells were seen in the control cultures. The results are consistent with a previous report (14Ménard C. Pupier S. Mornet D. Kitzmann M. Nargeot J. Lory P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29063-29070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast, the transfectants were small and round and mostly detached from the plastic culture dish, suggesting they had been damaged by the treatment. To examine whether apoptosis contributed to the cell damage seen in the transfectants after the differentiation treatment, a TUNEL assay and analysis of DNA content with propidium iodide staining were carried out using cells treated with or without differentiation medium for 3 days. In the TUNEL assay (Fig. 3 A), an increase in fluorescence intensity derived from DNA strand breaks was detected in the transfectants, but not in the control cells cultured in differentiation medium. Upon staining with propidium iodide (Fig. 3 B), apoptotic cells appeared as a hypodiploid DNA peak preceding the narrow peak of diploid DNA from viable cells. In the transfectants, a hypodiploid DNA peak was detected after differentiation treatment. No such peak was seen in control cells. Next, the activity of caspase-3 was examined in the cells cultured with or without differentiation medium for 3 days. Caspase-3 activity was markedly elevated after the differentiation treatment in the transfectants compared with the control cells (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that apoptosis was promoted by overexpression of CRT in H9c2 cells during the experimentally induced differentiation. Apoptosis is known to be regulated by several signal transduction pathways, including the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and protein kinase B/Akt pathways (24Ballif B.A. Blenis J. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 397-408PubMed Google Scholar). To reveal whether overexpression of CRT affected the cell survival signaling of Akt during differentiation-induced apoptosis, the phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 was examined and compared between control cells and cells transfected with the CRT gene during differentiation (Fig. 4 A). In controls, the levels of Ser473-phosphorylated Akt were unchanged on day 1 of the differentiation treatment, but decreased to 37% of initial values on day 3. In contrast, in the transfectants, they decreased to 35% of the initial level on day 1 of treatment. Akt activity was also examined in the controls and transfectants after 24 h of treatment to induce differentiation. Fig. 4 B shows that Akt activity was suppressed after 24 h of culture in differentiation medium in the transfectants, but not in the control cells. This is consistent with the finding that the level of phosphorylated Akt correlates well with the activity of Akt (25Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of BAD, a downstream signal of Akt, was examined. Despite the change in Akt activity, the level of phosphorylated BAD did not change significantly in either the control or transfected cells during differentiation (data not shown). To clarify the significance of Akt signaling to anti-apoptotic functions, cells were treated with 1% FCS and RA for 24 h in the presence or absence of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin (300 nm) and LY294002 (10 μm), and apoptosis was then examined by TUNEL methods. Fig. 5 A shows that the PI3K inhibitors enhanced apoptosis during treatment for 24 h in both control and transfected cells. Caspase-3 activity was also induced by the inhibitors (data not shown). Moreover, Fig. 5 B shows that phosphorylation of Akt was suppressed by the PI3K inhibitors during treatment. Thus, suppression of Akt signaling by specific inhibitors enhanced the differentiation-induced apoptosis, suggesting that Akt signaling has a vital anti-apoptotic function in this differentiation model. To establish whether overexpression of CRT affects the activity of PI3K, an upstream signaling molecule of Akt, we examined PI3K activity in control and gene-transfected cells treated with or without differentiation medium for 24 h. However, PI3K activity was not affected by overexpression of CRT during differentiation (data not shown). Next, to identify the molecules that suppressed Akt signaling in the transfectants upon the differentiation treatment, we focused on Ser/Thr phosphatases that could dephosphorylate Akt to suppress the signaling. Fig. 6 A shows the protein levels for cytosolic Ser/Thr phosphatases (i.e. PP1αc, PP2Acα, PP2B-Aα, and PP2Cα) determined by immunoblot analysis in control and gene-transfected cells with or without the differentiation treatment (1% FCS and RA for 24 h). In the case of both PP1αc and PP2B-Aα (calcineurin), there was no significant difference in the level of expression between the control and transfected cells, although the level increased slightly after the differentiation treatment. In contrast, the protein levels of PP2Acα increased significantly in the transfectants compared with the controls and increased during differentiation in both cases. Interestingly, for PP2Cα, protein levels were relatively suppressed in the transfectants. Moreover, no differentiation-induced increase in expression was observed, unlike for PP2Acα. The mRNA expression levels for PP2Acα and PP1αc were examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 6 B). The mRNA for PP2Acα increased significantly in the transfectants compared with the controls and following differentiation treatment in both cases. No such elevation in the basal level of mRNA was seen in the case of PP1αc. These results are consistent with the protein expression levels shown in Fig. 6 A. Next, we examined the enzymatic activity of total phosphatase and PP2A. Fig. 6 C shows that PP2A activity was strengthened in the transfectants compared with the controls with or without the differentiation treatment, but no such significant difference in total phosphatase activity was seen between control and transfected cells cultured with or without differentiation medium. Collectively, these results suggest that the elevation of PP2A was responsible for suppression of Akt phosphorylation in the gene-transfected cells, leading to a greater suscept"
https://openalex.org/W2075827648,"We reported previously an important role of cyclic AMP-response element (CRE) for the induction of interleukin-6 gene expression by angiotensin II (AngII). We examined signaling pathways that are responsible for AngII-induced phosphorylation of CRE-binding protein (CREB) at serine 133 that is a critical marker for the activation in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). AngII time dependently induced phosphorylation of CREB with a peak at 5 min. The AngII-induced phosphorylation of CREB was blocked by CV11974, an AngII type I receptor antagonist, suggesting that AngII type I receptor may mediate the phosphorylation of CREB. Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) by PD98059 or inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by SB203580 partially inhibited AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation. A protein kinase A inhibitor, H89, also partially suppressed AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation. Inhibition of epidermal growth factor-receptor by AG1478 suppressed the AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation as well as activation of ERK and p38MAPK. Overexpression of the dominant negative form of CREB by an adenovirus vector suppressed AngII-induced c-fos expression and incorporation of [3H]leucine to VSMC. These findings suggest that AngII may activate multiple signaling pathways involving two MAPK pathways and protein kinase A, all of which contribute to the activation of CREB. Transactivation of epidermal growth factor-receptor is also critical for AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation.

AngII activates another class of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) such as Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (5Zohn I.E., Yu, H., Li, X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and p38 MAPK (6Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol.

It is also reported that AngII activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt/protein kinase B pathway (7Takahashi T. Taniguchi T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Ishikawa Y. Yokoyama M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H1927-H1934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms of AngII-stimulated signaling pathways is important because these signaling pathways activate gene transcription of immediate early genes, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components, resulting in cardiovascular remodeling. angiotensin II cyclic AMP-response element CRE-binding protein CREB-binding protein vascular smooth muscle cells AngII type 1 receptor AngII type 2 receptor adenovirus mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase Jun N-terminal kinase MAPK-activated protein MAPK/ERK kinase protein kinase A phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase epidermal growth factor EGF receptor platelet-derived growth factor-BB nerve growth factor fibroblast growth factor calmodulin CaM kinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phorbol myristate acetate multiplicity of infection activating transcription factor cAMP-response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) (8Gonzalez G.A.

CREB binds to the octanucleotide sequence, TGACGTCA, as a homodimer and as a heterodimer in association with other members of the CREB/ATF family (9Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R.

Previous studies have demonstrated that neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors in different cell types can activate CREB (9Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R.

Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a serine residue at 133 (Ser-133) is necessary for transcriptional activation of CREB. The phosphorylation of Ser-133 is mediated by a variety of kinases such as: (i) protein kinase A (PKA) (9Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar) in response to an elevation of intracellular cAMP, (ii) calmodulin (CaM) kinases II and IV in response to an elevation in intracellular calcium (12Sheng M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated CREB at Ser-133 recruits CREB-binding protein (CBP), which is a transcriptional coactivator, and activates a number of genes that have a CRE site in their promoter regions. Overexpression of a dominant negative CREB transgene induces apoptosis in T cells following growth factor stimulation (16Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanyangam M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice overexpressing a dominant negative CREB in the heart developed dilated cardiomyopathy (17Fentzke R.C. Korcarz C.E. Lang R.M. Lin H. Leiden J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2415-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that CREB may contribute to cell survival and development. However, the precise role of CREB in the differentiation and proliferation of VSMC is not completely understood. Previously, we have reported that CRE site is crucial for AngII-induced interleukin-6 expression in VSMC (18Funakoshi Y. Ichiki T. Ito K. Takeshita A. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathway of AT1-R that regulates CREB activation remained unknown. In this report, we examined the signaling pathway of AT1-R responsible for CREB phosphorylation and the role of CREB in VSMC. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. AngII was purchased from Peptide Institute. PD98059, KN93, and wortmannin were obtained from Research Biochemicals International. SB203580 is a generous gift from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. H89 and W-7 were obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. AG1478 was obtained from Sigma. CV11974 was obtained from Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., and PD123319 was obtained from Warner-Lambert, Park Davis Co. All antibodies used in the experiments were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. except for the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, Vector Laboratories Inc.). [3H]leucine, [3H]thymidine, and [32P]dCTP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unless mentioned otherwise, other chemical reagents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals. VSMC were isolated from the thoracic aorta of Sprague-Dawley rats and maintained as described previously (18Funakoshi Y. Ichiki T. Ito K. Takeshita A. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Passages between 5 and 15 were used. VSMC were grown to confluent, growth-arrested in DMEM with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 2 days, and used for the experiments. VSMC (3 × 105) were prepared in a 6-cm tissue culture dish. After 48 h, 5 μg of CRE-luciferase fusion DNA (three copies of the CRE site located upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter drive the luciferase gene (CLONTECH)) and 2 μg of the β-galactosidase gene drive SV40 promoter-enhancer sequence were introduced to VSMC as described previously (18Funakoshi Y. Ichiki T. Ito K. Takeshita A. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and stimulated with 10−7mol/liter of AngII for 3 h in DMEM with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The luciferase activity was measured and normalized by β-galactosidase activity as described previously (18Funakoshi Y. Ichiki T. Ito K. Takeshita A. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Rat c-fos gene promoter (−436 bp–+45 bp) was cloned by polymerase chain reaction (19Wang W.W. Howells R.D. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 143: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The sequence was confirmed by dideoxy chain termination method in both sense and antisense strands, and the promoter region was subcloned into pGL3 basic luciferase expression vector (Promega). VSMC were lysed in a sample buffer (5 mmol/liter EDTA, 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mmol/liter NaCl, 30 mmol/liter sodium phosphate, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 1% aprotinin, 0.5% pepstatin A, 2 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmol/liter leupeptin). Proteins were electrophoresed in 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, MILLIPORE). The blots were blocked with TBS-T (20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mmol/liter NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 10% non-fat dry milk at room temperature for 1 h. Phosphorylated CREB at Ser-133 was detected by a phospho-CREB antibody (recognizes only the phosphorylated form) and ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film. The membranes were stripped by incubating in a buffer containing 100 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, and 100 mmol/liter 2-mercaptoethanol at 70 °C for 1 h and reprobed with an antibody against CREB (recognizes both the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms) by the same procedure. The intensity of the bands was quantified by a MacBAS bioimaging analyzer (Fujifilm Co). Western blot analyses of ERK and p38MAPK were performed by the same procedure as that of CREB. 16-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with an injection of sodium pentobarbital and killed by exsanguination, and the aorta was removed. After the adventitia was removed, the aorta was placed in a culture dish and stimulated with AngII in DMEM with 0.1% of bovine serum albumin for 1 h in the presence or absence of an isoform-specific antagonist for AngII receptor. Then, the lysate of aorta was prepared by incubating in the lysis buffer for 3 h and subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. A recombinant adenovirus vector expressing a mutant of CREB (Ad-CREB-M1) in which the phosphorylation site at Ser-133 was changed to alanine was a gift from Dr. Anthony J. Zeleznik (University of Pittsburgh) (20Somers J.P. DeLoia J.A. Zeleznik A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1364-1372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VSMC grown to confluent were washed with PBS three times. Then, the cells were incubated with Ad-CREB-M1 or adenovirus vector expressing LacZ (Ad-LacZ) under gentle agitation for 2 h at room temperature. After infection, the cells were washed three times, cultured in DMEM with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 2 days, and used for the experiments. Multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) indicates the number of virus per cell added to culture dish. Total RNA was prepared according to an acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and Northern blot analysis of c-fos and 18 S ribosomal RNA was performed by a conventional method as described previously (18Funakoshi Y. Ichiki T. Ito K. Takeshita A. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). VSMC were incubated with AngII (10−6 mol/liter), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB (50 ng/ml), or serum (5%) for 24 h. The cells were labeled with [3H]leucine or [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) during the last 4 h. After labeling, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and then washed with a mixture of ethanol and ether (2:1). The cells were lysed in 0.5 n NaOH, and incorporated [3H]leucine or [3H]thymidine was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Statistical analyses were performed by one-way analysis of variance and multiple comparison (Fisher) tests if appropriate. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. We tested whether AngII activated CRE-dependent gene transcription by using CRE-luciferase reporter construct. As shown Fig. 1, normalized luciferase activity after AngII stimulation (10−7 mol/liter) was increased by 1.7-fold as compared with that of control (mean ± S.E.,n = 6, p < 0.01). The induction of luciferase activity by AngII was blocked by an AT1-R antagonist, CV11974, but not by an AT2-R antagonist PD123319. This result suggests that AT1-R is responsible for the induction. Expression of the dominant negative form of CREB by Ad-CREB-M1 inhibited the up-regulation of CRE-luciferase activity by AngII. CRE is one of the important cis-DNA elements regulating c-fos gene expression in response to mitogen (22Hartig E. Loncarevic I.F. Buscher M. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4153-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). AngII increased c-fos promoter activity by 2-fold, which was abolished by overexpression of the dominant negative form of CREB (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that CRE and CREB play a critical role for AngII-induced gene expression in VSMC. To investigate whether CREB is phosphorylated in response to AngII, we performed Western blot analysis using an antibody that only recognizes CREB species phosphorylated at Ser-133 (phospho-CREB antibody). AngII stimulated phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 2A, upper panel) with a peak at 5 min of stimulation. AngII dose dependently induced phosphorylation of CREB at 5 min of stimulation (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Next, we determined the AngII receptor isoform responsible for CREB phosphorylation. Preincubation with CV11974 (10−5 mol/liter) completely abolished the CREB phosphorylation induced by AngII; however, PD123319 (10−5mol/liter) did not show any effect (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that AT1-R may mediate the phosphorylation of CREB. The total level of CREB protein expression as detected by Western blot analysis with an antibody against CREB was unchanged after AngII stimulation (Fig, 2, A and B, lower panels). The ratio of phosphorylated CREB to total CREB measured by an imaging analyzer is shown in the right panel. To confirm that AngII stimulates CREB phosphorylation in intact aorta, rat aorta was stimulated with AngII ex vivo. Although it took about 1 h to detect, AngII induced phosphorylation of CREB in an AT1-R-dependent manner in intact aorta (Fig. 2C). The origin of CREB and phosphorylated CREB in intact aorta is not clear at this point. We observed, however, that AngII induced CREB phosphorylation in cultured aortic endothelial cells (data not shown), suggesting that both endothelial cells and VSMC are the source for CREB. A variety of protein kinases are reported to phosphorylate CREB. We investigated whether MAPK pathways were involved in AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation. AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation was partially blocked by PD98059 (30 μmol/liter), an ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, or SB203580 (10 μmol/liter), a p38MAPK inhibitor. A combination of PD98059 and SB203580 additionally inhibited the AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). The same concentration of PD98059 or SB203580 completely blocked the AngII-induced ERK phosphorylation and p38MAPK activation (23Blair A.S. Hajduch E. Litherland G.J. Hundal H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36293-36299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), respectively. These data suggest that these inhibitors sufficiently inhibited these MAPK pathways (Fig. 3C). W-7 and KN-93 are known as inhibitors of CaM and CaM-dependent protein kinase II, respectively (12Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 24Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, W-7 (50 μmol/liter) inhibited AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation. However, KN-93 had no significant effect. Inhibition of CaM by W-7 blocked the AngII-induced ERK activation (Fig. 4C) as reported previously (25Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), suggesting that the effect of W7 may be ascribed to inhibition of the ERK pathway rather than inhibition of CaMK. W7 and KN-93 completely blocked the A23187-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 4D), indicating that the doses of these inhibitors sufficiently inhibited the calmodulin/CaMK pathway. A recent study suggests that CREB is a downstream target of Akt/protein kinase B that is activated by PI3K (15Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Preincubation with wortmannin (50 nmol/liter, 30 min) that inhibits PI3K did not affect AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 5,A and B). However, wortmannin inhibited insulin-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 5C), indicating that the PI3K-Akt pathway was sufficiently inhibited by this concentration of wortmannin in our VSMC. Next, we examined the effect of H89, a specific PKA inhibitor, on AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation. Preincubation with H89 partially inhibited AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 6, A and B). H89 at this concentration completely inhibited the forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 6C) but did not affect AngII-induced ERK or p38MAPK activation (Fig. 6D). Recent reports have shown that transactivation of EGF-R is indispensable for the signaling of certain G-protein-coupled receptors (26Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar) including AT1-R (25Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the effect of AG1478, a specific EGF-R inhibitor, on AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, AG1478 completely abolished AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation. AG1478 also inhibited AngII-induced activation of ERK (Fig. 7C) and p38MAPK (Fig. 7D). However, inhibition of the protein kinase C pathway by prolonged exposure to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or GF109203X did not affect the activation of CREB, ERK, or p38MAPK by AngII (Fig. 8, A–D). Prolonged exposure to PMA or GF109203X completely inhibited PMA-induced CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 8E), suggesting that these treatments sufficiently suppressed PKC pathway.Figure 8Effect of PKC inhibitors on AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation. VSMC were incubated with PMA (1 μmol/liter) for 24 h or GF109203X (1 μmol/liter) for 30 min and then stimulated with AngII (10−7 mol/liter) for 5 min. Western blot analysis (A) and the densitometric analysis (B) were performed as described in the legend for Fig. 2. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = 4). **,p < 0.01 versus control (con). O/N, overnight exposure. The effect of prolonged exposure to PMA or GF109203X on AngII-induced ERK (C) and p38MAPK (D) activation was examined as described in the legend for Fig. 3. The same results were obtained in other independent experiments (n = 3), and a representative autoradiograph is shown. The effect of prolonged exposure to PMA or GF109203X on PMA (1 μmol/liter for 10 min)-induced CREB activation was examined as described in the legend for Fig. 2(E). The same results were obtained in other independent experiments (n = 3), and a representative autoradiograph is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To clarify the role of CREB in AngII signaling, we overexpressed the dominant negative form of CREB by an adenovirus vector. The immunoreactivity of CREB was increased in an m.o.i.-dependent manner (Fig. 9A, lower panel). Phosphorylation of CREB by AngII was attenuated by the infection of Ad-CREB-M1 (p < 0.01). We used overexpression of β-galactosidase by Ad-LacZ as a negative control for the infection of adenovirus. As shown in Fig. 9B, the infection of Ad-LacZ did not affect AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation. Ad-CREB-M1 but not Ad-LacZ suppressed AngII-induced c-fos mRNA expression (Fig. 9C). Next, we examined the effect of Ad-CREB-M1 on AngII-induced protein and DNA synthesis. The infection of Ad-CREB-M1 suppressed AngII-induced leucine incorporation (Fig. 10A), whereas Ad-LacZ did not affect the AngII-induced leucine incorporation. We also measured AngII-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation. However, AngII caused a very small increase in thymidine incorporation in our VSMC as reported previously (27Geisterfer A.A.T. Peach M.J. Owens G.k. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), and we failed to see a significant effect of Ad-CREB-M1 on AngII-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 10B). Ad-CREB-M1 did not affect PDGF-BB- or serum-induced incorporation of leucine (Fig. 10C), suggesting that the infection of Ad-CREB-M1 is not toxic. This is, to our knowledge, the first report showing AT1-R-regulated CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent gene transcription. AngII activated several protein kinases that phosphorylated CREB at Ser-133 through AT1-R. Our results suggest that AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation is mediated by at least three distinct pathways: (i) a MEK-ERK pathway that can be blocked by PD98059, (ii) a p38MAPK pathway that can be blocked by SB203580, and (iii) a PKA-dependent pathway that can be blocked by H89. In addition, transactivation of EGF-R is critical for CREB phosphorylation. ERK plays an important role for the signaling of many growth factors. AngII activates ERK through transactivation of EGF-R (25Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Recently, nerve growth factor (NGF) (13Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) and EGF (28De Cesare D. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12202-12207Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) were reported to phosphorylate and activate CREB through the ERK-p90rsk2-dependent pathway. AngII-induced p90rsk2 activation is also ERK-dependent (29Takahashi E. Abe J. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that this pathway may be important for AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation. In contrast to EGF or NGF, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-induced CREB phosphorylation is mediated by MAPKAP kinase-2 (14Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) that lies immediately downstream from p38MAPK. AngII was also reported to activate p38MAPK (6Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Griendling K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15022-15029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel protein kinase that is activated by both ERK and p38MAPK was reported and designated mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK-1) (30Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). MSK-1 phosphorylates CREB in response to FGF or NGF in PC12 cells. At present, it is not clear which kinase is directly responsible for AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation downstream from p38MAPK or ERK. Transactivation of EGF-R is a critical signaling step for certain G-protein-coupled receptors such as endothelin, thrombin, and AngII receptor (25Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 26Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). We showed that AngII activates ERK and p38MAPK in an EGF-R-dependent manner, suggesting that inhibition of AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation by AG1478 may be ascribed to the suppression of these MAPK pathways. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of the calcium/CaM pathway is crucial for the AngII signaling (25Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, the downstream CaM-dependent kinase activated by AngII is not clear. Recently, Abraham et al. (31Abraham S.T. Benscoter H.A. Schworer C.M. Singer H.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) reported that inhibition of CaM kinase II by KN-93 partially inhibited AngII-induced ERK phosphorylation. A previous study showed that CaM kinase II and IV were able to phosphorylate CREB (12Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Our study showed that KN-93 did not affect AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation, whereas an inhibition of CaM by W-7 partially suppressed it. These data may suggest that CaM kinase IV rather than CaM kinase II is responsible for AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation. However, W-7 completely suppressed the AngII-induced ERK activation as reported previously (25Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), suggesting that the effect of W-7 may be ascribed to inhibition of the ERK pathway rather than inhibition of the CaM kinase IV pathway. Furthermore, it was also reported that CaM kinase IV was not expressed in VSMC (32Hanissian S.H. Frangakis M. Bland M.M. Jawahar S. Chatila T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20055-20063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it is unlikely that CaM kinase IV phosphorylates CREB in response to AngII. To our surprise, AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation was partially inhibited by H89, a PKA inhibitor. The majority of reports showed that AngII inhibits adenylate cyclase (33Jard S. Cantau B. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2603-2606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Pobiner B.F. Hewlett E.L. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16200-16209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of adenylate cyclase in AngII signaling is still enigmatic because there are several studies that have reported activation of adenylate cyclase in response to AngII (35Missale C. Memo M. Sigala S. Carruba M.O. Spano S.F. Regul. Pept. 1989; 24: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Further investigation is necessary to determine whether cAMP production and PKA activity are up-regulated or down-regulated by AngII in VSMC. We showed that H89 inhibited the forskolin-induced CREB phosphorylation but did not affect the AngII-induced ERK or p38MAPK activation, suggesting that H89 inhibited AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation independently of MAPK pathways. Recently, Impey et al. (36Impey S. Obrietan K. Wong S.T. Poser S. Yano S. Wayman G. Deloulme J.C. Chan G. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 869-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) reported an obligatory role of PKA for the nuclear translocation of ERK and subsequent CREB activation in response to NGF in neuronal culture. They failed to detect an elevation of intracellular cAMP level by NGF and proposed that basal PKA activity was critical for the nuclear translocation of ERK. Therefore it may be possible that basal PKA activity rather than activation of PKA is necessary for AngII-induced CREB activation. Although AngII induced CREB phosphorylation by severalfold, AngII increased CRE promoter activity by ∼2.0-fold. The reason for this difference is not clear. However, Brindle et al. (37Brindle P. Nakajima T. Montminy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10521-10525Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and Ginty et al. (38Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) reported that the ability to activate CRE-dependent gene transcription is different among signaling pathways despite the similar level of CREB phosphorylation. A recent report by Mayr et al. (39Mayr B.M. Canettieri G. Montminy M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10936-10941Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) may explain this differential effect on CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent gene transcription. They showed that the CREB-CBP complex induced by mitogenic signals such as NGF or EGF is less stable than that induced by cAMP in the nucleus. Therefore the relative instability of AngII-induced CREB-CBP complex may account for the weak activation of CRE-dependent gene transcription by AngII. Alternatively, basal promoter activity of these luciferase constructs is relatively high in our VSMC, and the up-regulation of luciferase activity by AngII may not be prominent. Ad-CREB-M1 almost completely suppressed AngII-induced leucine incorporation. Because a number of genes are reported to have a CRE site in the promoter region, it is difficult to determine the CREB-dependent gene(s) that is responsible for AngII-induced leucine incorporation in VSMC. There may be a few CREB-dependent genes that are important for VSMC hypertrophy. Alternatively, partial suppression of gene expression, such as the effect of Ad-CREB-M1 on AngII-induced c-fos expression that we observed, might accumulate when CREB is inhibited and the cumulative effects eventually result in inhibition of leucine incorporation. Further study is necessary to identify the target gene(s) that is inhibited by the dominant negative form of CREB. At any rate, AD-CREB-M1 is not toxic because it did not affect PDGF-BB- or serum-induced leucine incorporation. Ad-CREB-M1 attenuated AngII-induced CREB phosphorylation, which may contribute to the inhibition of CREB function. However, the mechanism by which CREB-M1 inhibits CREB function is believed to replace the endogenous CREB with the mutated CREB rather than to inhibit phosphorylation of endogenous CREB (20Somers J.P. DeLoia J.A. Zeleznik A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1364-1372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because CREB can dimerize with the ATF-1 transcription factor, it is possible that the effect of CREB-M1 may be ascribed to the sequestration of ATF-1. This possibility cannot be excluded at this point. VSMC express α1 and β-adrenergic receptors. A recent study has shown that stimulation of α1receptor induces CREB phosphorylation (40Lin R.Z. Chen J. Hu Z.W. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30033-30038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This study and our data suggest that signaling of the adrenergic system and renin angiotensin system may converge on CRE-dependent gene transcription and the possible involvement of CREB in vascular remodeling. Although the precise role of CREB in VSMC is not clarified, CREB activation pathway may represent a potentially novel target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. A growing body of evidences suggests that the renin angiotensin system plays a critical role in the processes of cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and atherosclerosis. Our results suggest that the pathophysiological relevance for activation of AT1-R may involve transcriptional activation of the gene containing the CRE enhancer element."

In this study, two full-length and one partial transporter genes were isolated from betaine-accumulating mangrove Avicennia marina. Their homologies to betaine transporters from bacteria and betaine/4-aminobutyrate transporters from mammalian cells were low but were high to proline transporters from Arabidopsis and tomato. Two full-length transporters could complement the Na+-sensitive phenotype of the Escherichia coli mutant deficient in betT, putPA, proP, and proU. Both transporters could efficiently take up betaine and proline with similar affinities (Km, 0.32–0.43 mm) and maximum velocities (1.9–3.6 nmol/min/mg of protein). The uptakes of betaine and proline were significantly inhibited by mono- and dimethylglycine but only partially inhibited by betaine aldehyde, choline, and 4-aminobutyrate. Sodium and potassium chloride markedly enhanced betaine uptake rates with optimum concentrations at 0.5 m, whereas sucrose showed only modest activation. The change of amino acids Thr290-Thr-Ser292 in a putative periplasmic loop to Arg290-Gly-Arg292yielded the active transporter independent of salts, suggesting the positive charge induced a conformational change to the active form. These data clearly indicate that the betaine-accumulating mangrove contains betaine/proline transporters whose properties are distinct from betaine transporters of bacteria and mammalian cells.

These data clearly indicate that the betaine-accumulating mangrove contains betaine/proline transporters whose properties are distinct from betaine transporters of bacteria and mammalian cells. The accumulation of osmoprotectants is an important process for the adaptation to adverse environmental conditions (1Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol.

The increase of osmoprotectants is achieved either by altering metabolism (increasing biosynthesis and/or decreasing degradation) or by transport (increased uptake and/or decreased export). Glycine betaine (betaine) is a major osmoprotectant in bacteria, algae, plants, and animals (1Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol.

In plants, betaine is synthesized in chloroplasts from choline via two-step oxidations (3Rathinasabapathi B. Burnet M. Russell B.L. Gage D.A. Liao P.C. Nye G.J. Scott P. Golbeck J.H. Hanson A.D.

However, very little is known about the betaine transport in plants, and the betaine transport activity has only directly been demonstrated using a proline transporter from tomato (LeProT1) 1The abbreviations used are: LeProTtomato proline transporterAmTAvicennia marina betaine/proline transporterProTproline transporterAtProTArabidopsis thaliana ProTGABA4-aminobutyrateIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosideTMtransmembraneMES2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: LeProTtomato proline transporterAmTAvicennia marina betaine/proline transporterProTproline transporterAtProTArabidopsis thaliana ProTGABA4-aminobutyrateIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosideTMtransmembraneMES2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (6Schwacke R.

Bush D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). ProT is a member of the ATF superfamily together with the broad substrate specificity amino acid permease and putative indole acetic acid transporter. But few studies have been carried out on plant ProTs. ProT genes were isolated from Arabidopsis (AtProT1 and -2) (9Rentsch M. Hirner B. Schmelzer E. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), tomato (LeProT1–3) (6Schwacke R. Grallath S. Breitkreuz K.E. Stransky E. Stransky H. Frommer W.B. Rentsch D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 377-392PubMed Google Scholar), and rice (OsProT) (10Igarashi Y. Yoshiba Y. Takeshita T. Nomura S. Otomo J. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Among three tomato LeProTs, only one clone, LeProT1, could complement functional deficiencies in proline transport in yeast (6Schwacke R. Grallath S. Breitkreuz K.E. Stransky E. Stransky H. Frommer W.B. Rentsch D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 377-392PubMed Google Scholar). LeProT1 was specifically expressed in pollen, whereas the mRNA for LeProT2 and LeProT3 could not be detected in any organs (6Schwacke R. Grallath S. Breitkreuz K.E. Stransky E. Stransky H. Frommer W.B. Rentsch D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 377-392PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that LeProT1 could take up proline, betaine, and 4-aminobutyrate (GABA) (6Schwacke R. Grallath S. Breitkreuz K.E. Stransky E. Stransky H. Frommer W.B. Rentsch D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 377-392PubMed Google Scholar), and AtProT2 could take up GABA as well as proline (9Rentsch M. Hirner B. Schmelzer E. Frommer W.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1437-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 11Breitkreuz K.E. Shelp B.J. Fisher W.N. Schwacke R. Rentsch D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 450: 280-284Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting that in plants, proline, betaine, and GABA are transported with the same transporter (6Schwacke R. Grallath S. Breitkreuz K.E. Stransky E. Stransky H. Frommer W.B. Rentsch D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 377-392PubMed Google Scholar,11Breitkreuz K.E. Shelp B.J. Fisher W.N. Schwacke R. Rentsch D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 450: 280-284Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Properties of the above ProTs from plants are different from those in bacteria and mammalian cells. In Escherichia coli, betaine and proline betaine were essentially taken up by the ATP-binding cassette transporter ProU (12Haardt M. Kempf B. Faat E. Bremer E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and secondary transporter ProP (13Culham D.E. Lasby B. Marangoni A.G. Milner J.L. Steer B.A. van Nues R.W. Wood J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), whereas proline was taken up by the proline-specific secondary transporter PutP (14Nelson K. Selander R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6886-6895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The affinities of ProU and ProP for betaine and proline betaine were very high, in the micromolar range, whereas the affinity for proline was low (15Bremer E. Kramer R. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses. AMS Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 79-97Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, betaine was taken up by a betaine/GABA or proline/GABA transporter (16Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Kwon H.M. Preston A.S. Robey R.B. Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Handler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 649-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hitherto, a betaine-specific transporter has not been reported in plants. Transport activity of betaine has only been demonstrated using a proline transporter from tomato, a betaine-nonaccumulating plant. Therefore, it was of interest to characterize ProTs in betaine-accumulating plants. In a previous study (17Hibino T. Meng Y.-L. Kawamitsu Y. Uehara N. Matsuda U. Tanaka Y. Ishikawa Y. Baba S. Takabe T. Wada K. Ishii T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 44: 353-363Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we constructed a cDNA library from betaine-accumulating mangrove Avicennia marina and showed that A. marina has unique betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase genes. Here we isolated betaine transporter genes from A. marina and characterized the molecular properties of their gene products. We show that A. marina contains betaine/proline transporters with substrate specificity and salt sensitivity distinct from previously reported proline transporters from plants. Moreover, one of these transporters showed a novel regulation of activity by introducing the additional positive charges on the periplasmic loop of the transporter. E. coli DH5α cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium. E. coli MKH13 cells deficient in betT, putPA, proP, and proU genes (12Haardt M. Kempf B. Faat E. Bremer E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C in minimal medium A containing 0.2% glucose and ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Radiolabeled [1-14C]betaine (55 mCi/mmol) andl-[U-14C]proline (50 mCi/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO) and AmershamBiosciences, respectively. The cDNA library from A. marina was constructed using the ZAP cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (17Hibino T. Meng Y.-L. Kawamitsu Y. Uehara N. Matsuda U. Tanaka Y. Ishikawa Y. Baba S. Takabe T. Wada K. Ishii T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 44: 353-363Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For the isolation of betaine transporter genes, the mixed oligonucleotides were synthesized based on the known sequences of ProT. The sequences of all the primers and probes are shown in Table I. The forward primer ProT-F corresponds to the 175–195 bases from the translation start codon of AtProT1 cDNA (18Frommer W.B. Hummel S. Riesmeier J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5944-5948Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Hsu L.C. Chiou T.J. Chen L. Bush D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7441-7445Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The reverse primer ProT-R corresponds to the 718–738 bases of AtProT1 cDNA. The cDNA library was divided into 96 fractions so that each well contained about 104 plaque-forming units. The betaine/proline transporter clones were checked by nucleotide sequencing. The fractions containing transporter clones were further diluted 100-fold and amplified. After sequencing more than 20 clones, three kinds of clones (clones 1–3) were obtained. Following five times of dilution and amplification, pure clones were obtained. Two clones (clone 1 and clone 2) contain the full-length genes that encode A. marina transporters 1 (AmT1) and 2 (AmT2), respectively, whereas one clone (clone 3) encodes a partial transporter (AmT3). The DNA sequence was determined using a 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and analyzed with the DNASIS program (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Kanagawa, Japan).Table IPrimers and probes for isolation and expression of AmT genes and for detection of their mRNA levelsPrimer/probe5′–3′Base pairsProT-F(G/A)T(T/C)ATGGT(T/C)CC(A/T) (T/C)T(G/A)GG(A/C/T)TGG21-merProT-R(G/A/T)GC(T/C)TG(G/A/T)AT(T/C)TC (G/A/T)GG(G/A)A(G/T)CAT21-merAmT1-NcoICGCCATGGATGTCCGAGGAGGA22-merAmT1-EcoRITCGAATTCTATATCGGCAAAAAG23-merAmT2-NcoIGACCATGGAGAGCCAAGGAA20-merAmT2-XhoIATCTCGAGCTTATGTCAGCAAAAACAT27-merAmT1-BamHIATGGATCCAAAAGGGGAAGGTACTTGCTCAA- TAA34-merTaq-AmT1FCTCAGCACGTTTCCTCTC18-merTaq-AmT1RTTCTGCAGAAGGCTCATCT19-merTaq-AmT2FCTCAGCACGTTTCCCCTC18-merTaq-AmT2RCTGCAGAGAAGTAAGCTCG19-merTaq-AmT3FTATCAGCACATTCCCCCTT19-merTaq-AmT3RTTGTGCAGGGGACTTAGCT19-merTaq probeFam-TTGGCCACAAGATACATGTGGTT-Tamra23-merFam, 5′-fluorescein; Tamra, 3′-rhodamine.

The forward primers, AmT1-NcoI and AmT2-NcoI, for clones 1 and 2, respectively, contain the start codon ATG and NcoI site. The reverse primers, AmT1-EcoRI and AmT2-XhoI, for clones 1 and 2, respectively, contain the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively. The amplified fragment was ligated into NcoI/EcoRI and NcoI/XhoI sites of the pTrcHis2C plasmid (20Waditee R. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36931-36938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids, pAmT1 and pAmT2, encoding the AmT1 and AmT2 transporters, respectively, were fused in-frame to six histidines. The expression plasmids were transferred first to E. coli DH5α cells and then to MKH13 (12Haardt M. Kempf B. Faat E. Bremer E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) cells in which betT, putPA, proP, and proU genes were deleted. A site-directed mutant in which the tripeptide Thr290-Thr-Ser292 in AmT1 was replaced with Arg290-Gly-Arg292 was constructed as follows. The fragment covered by the restriction sites, BamHI site at 859 in pAmT1 and EcoRI site in pTrcHis2C, was amplified by the PCR technique using pAmT1 as a template. The forward primer AmT1-BamHI contains the BamHI site and AGGGGAAGG encoding Arg290-Gly-Arg292. The amplified fragment was ligated into the BamHI- and EcoRI-digested pAmT1, which generated the plasmid pAmT1m. For the complementation test on agar plates, E. coli MKH13 cells transformed with pTrcHis2C, pAmT1, and pAmT2 were grown overnight at 37 °C in minimal medium A (pH 6.7) containing 0.2% glucose and ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Cells were then spread on a 1.4% agar plate containing 0.7 mNaCl, 1 mm IPTG, and 1 mm betaine or 1 mm proline and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. E. coli MKH13 cells transformed with pTrcHis2C, pAmT1, and pAmT2 were grown overnight at 37 °C in minimal medium A (pH 6.7) containing 0.2% glucose and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and were inoculated into the same fresh medium with an absorbance at 620 nm (A620) of 0.05. IPTG (1 mm) was added to the mid log-phase cells (A620 between 0.6 and 0.8). After a 3-h incubation, cells were harvested, washed twice, and suspended to an A620 of 1.0 in the same medium. Subsequently the cells were incubated with shaking for 5 min at 37 °C, and transport was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mm[1-14C]betaine orl-[U-14C]proline. For Km and Vm determinations, the concentrations of betaine or proline were varied from 0.01 to 5 mm. Glucose was added to a final concentration of 5 mm to energize the cells, and where indicated, salt (NaCl or KCl) or sucrose was added to the indicated concentrations. Cells were collected on 0.2-μm-pore-size cellulose nitrate filters (Advantec MFS, Chiba, Japan). Filters were washed with 3 ml of buffer (same salinity as the assay buffer), and the radioactivity trapped in the cells was measured with a liquid scintillation counter (model 3200C, Aloka Instruments Co., Tokyo, Japan). Competitions for betaine uptake and proline uptake were performed in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess (10 mm) of competitors. Quantification of AmT1–3 mRNA was carried out using a TaqMan fluorescent chemical analysis method (17Hibino T. Meng Y.-L. Kawamitsu Y. Uehara N. Matsuda U. Tanaka Y. Ishikawa Y. Baba S. Takabe T.

Total RNA was extracted by using the SDS-phenol method. RT-PCR and DNA amplification were carried out by using TaqMan RT reagents and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, respectively (Applied Biosystems). The clone-specific primers and TaqMan fluorescent probe, shown in Table I, were used for amplification. A computer algorithm was used for comparison of the amount of reporter dye emission with the quenching dye emission during the PCR amplification, generating a ΔRn value as follows: ΔRn = (ΔRn+) − (ΔRn−), where ΔRn+ is (emission intensity of reporter)/(emission intensity of quencher at any given time in the reaction tube), and ΔRn− is (emission intensity of reporter)/(emission intensity of quencher before PCR amplification in the reaction tube). The ΔRn value was used for the construction of amplification plots. The hydropathy profile of the deduced amino acid sequence was predicted according to the method of Kyte and Doolittle (23Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17169) Google Scholar). The possible transmembrane (TM) segments of the AmT1 sequence were deduced by a computer program TopPredII (24Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 331-337PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (17Hibino T. Meng Y.-L. Kawamitsu Y. Uehara N. Matsuda U. Tanaka Y. Ishikawa Y. Baba S. Takabe T. Wada K. Ishii T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 44: 353-363Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (17Hibino T. Meng Y.-L. Kawamitsu Y. Uehara N. Matsuda U. Tanaka Y. Ishikawa Y. Baba S. Takabe T. Wada K. Ishii T. Takabe T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 44: 353-363Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An antibody raised against a six-histidine (His6) tag was obtained from R&D Systems, Inc. (25Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2000; 125: 437-446Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Using the mixed oligonucleotides, three kinds of gene fragments were amplified from the cDNA library of A. marina. Nucleotide sequencing of isolated pure clones showed that clones 1, 2, and 3 contain the 1830-, 1794, and 1432-bp DNAs, respectively, and poly(A) sequences in their 3′-terminal regions (data not shown). The homology search revealed that clones 1 and 2 encode the full length of transporters, whereas clone 3 encodes the N-terminal-missing transporter. Several attempts to isolate the full length of clone 3 were unsuccessful. The predicted gene products for clone 1 (AmT1) and clone 2 (AmT2) consist of 446 amino acids with a molecular mass of 48,742 Da and 447 amino acids with a molecular mass of 48,645 Da, respectively (Fig. 1 A). The gene product for clone 3 (AmT3) consists of 440 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). It was found that AmT1–3 are highly homologous to each other and also to other ProTs from plants as shown in Fig. 1 A (6Schwacke R. Grallath S. Breitkreuz K.E. Stransky E. Stransky H. Frommer W.B.

In contrast, AmT1–3 showed low homology to amino acid permease AAP1 (18Frommer W.B. Hummel S. Riesmeier J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hitherto, the complementation of a salt-sensitive betaine-deficient mutant by plant transporters has not been reported. To test this, E. coli MKH13 cells were transformed with pTrcHis2C, pAmT1, and pAmT2. Western blotting analysis of the membrane fractions revealed that the MKH13 cells transformed with pAmT1 and pAmT2 exhibited a single cross-reaction band corresponding to ∼48 kDa when IPTG was included in the culture medium, whereas no band could be detected without IPTG (Fig. 2 A). The levels of AmT1 and AmT2 increased with increasing concentrations of IPTG (from 0.2 to 1.0 mm) and were almost saturated at 0.5 mm IPTG. As a positive control of membrane proteins, the outer membrane protein A of E. coli (OmpA) was used to show which levels were independent of the concentrations of IPTG. Fig. 2 A also shows that the levels of AmT1 were slightly higher than that of AmT2. In contrast, the cells transformed with the vector alone (pTrcHis2C) did not show any band regardless of the presence or absence of IPTG (data not shown). These facts indicate that the mangrove transporters could be expressed and assembled in E. coli membranes. The E. coli MKH13 cells are unable to grow in high osmolality medium containing betaine due to the lack of a betaine transport system as well as betaine synthesis genes (12Haardt M. Kempf B. Faat E. Bremer E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 26Peter H. Burkovski A. Kramer R. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1049-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows that the MKH13 cells transformed with vector alone (pTrcHis2C) could not grow on agar plates containing minimal medium A, 0.7 m NaCl, and 1 mm betaine either in the presence or absence of IPTG. Neither pAmT1 nor pAmT2 could complement the E. coli MKH13 cells under the same conditions in the absence of IPTG (data not shown). However, the pAmT1 and pAmT2 could complement the MKH13 cells if IPTG, at a concentration higher than 0.1 mm, was included in the agar plate (Fig. 2 B). The inclusion of betaine was indispensable for the complementation (data not shown). The complementation by pAmT2 was slightly less effective than that by pAmT1 (Fig. 2 B). These data indicate that both AmT1 and AmT2 are involved in the uptake of betaine by the MKH13 cells, thus allowing their growth under high salinity. Since the MKH13 cells do not contain the proline transporters ProP and ProU (2Kempf B. Bremer E. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 12Haardt M. Kempf B. Faat E. Bremer E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Bremer E. Kramer R. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses. AMS Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 79-97Google Scholar), we therefore tested whether the MKH13 cells could grow under high salinity in the presence of proline. Fig. 2 B shows that the E. coli MKH13 cells transformed with pAmT1 and pAmT2 could grow on the agar plates containing minimal medium A, 0.7 m NaCl, 1 mm proline, and IPTG (>0.2 mm). In this case, the complementation by pAmT1 was less effective than that by pAmT2 (Fig. 2 B). Both proline and IPTG were indispensable for the complementation (data not shown). These data indicate that the uptake of proline by AmT1 and AmT2 enables the growth of the MKH13 cells under high salinity. To examine directly the transporter activity of AmT1 and AmT2, we measured the kinetic parameters for these transporters. Hitherto, the kinetic parameters for betaine uptake by plant transporters have only been reported for LeProT1 (6Schwacke R. Grallath S. Breitkreuz K.E. Stransky E. Stransky H. Frommer W.B. Rentsch D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 377-392PubMed Google Scholar). No measurable uptake of [1-14C]betaine or ofl-[U-14C]proline was observed for the MKH13 cells transformed with pTrcHis2C (Fig. 3,A and B). Consistent with the results of the complementation test, the MKH13 cells transformed with pAmT1 and pAmT2 could take up betaine and proline (Fig. 3, A and B). The Km and Vm values for betaine uptake by AmT1 at pH 6.7 and 0.3 m NaCl were 0.34 mm and 3.3 nmol of betaine min−1 (mg of protein)−1, respectively (Fig. 3 C). The corresponding Km and Vm values by AmT2 were 0.36 mm and 1.9 nmol of betaine min−1 (mg of protein)−1, respectively (Fig. 3 C). Similar values were obtained for proline uptake (Fig. 3 D). The Km and Vm values for proline uptake by AmT1 were 0.43 mm and 3.6 nmol of proline min−1 (mg of protein)−1, and those by AmT2 were 0.32 mm and 2.7 nmol of proline min−1 (mg of protein)−1. Results in Fig. 3,A and C, are compatible with the results in Fig. 2 B showing slightly more effective complementation of betaine-deficient MKH13 cells by AmT1 than that by AmT2, whereas the results in Fig. 3, B and D, are apparently incompatible with the results of complementation of proline-deficient MKH13 cells in Fig. 2 B. Nonetheless, all the above data indicate that both AmT1 and AmT2 transport betaine and proline with similar kinetic properties. To obtain the information on the substrate specificity, we performed the competition experiments. Consistent with the betaine and proline uptake experiments (Fig. 3), the betaine uptake by AmT1 was significantly inhibited by both l- andd-proline (Fig. 4 A). However, it was only partially inhibited by GABA (Fig. 4 A), which is in contrast to that of LeProT1 (6Schwacke R. Grallath S. Breitkreuz K.E. Stransky E. Stransky H. Frommer W.B. Rentsch D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 377-392PubMed Google Scholar). In LeProT1, the betaine uptake was significantly inhibited by betaine, proline, and GABA (6Schwacke R. Grallath S. Breitkreuz K.E. Stransky E. Stransky H. Frommer W.B. Rentsch D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 377-392PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A shows that other amino acids such as alanine, arginine, glycine, glutamic acid, and histidine did not inhibit the betaine uptake by AmT1. It was also observed that proline betaine, betaine aldehyde, and choline only partially inhibited the betaine uptake by AmT1. In contrast, mono- and dimethylglycine strongly inhibited betaine uptake by AmT1. Essentially similar competition patterns were obtained for the betaine uptake by AmT2 (Fig. 4 B). These results strongly suggest that the AmT1 and AmT2 are a betaine and proline transporter but not a GABA transporter. Next we examined the competition for proline uptake mediated by AmT1 and AmT2. For AmT1, the proline uptake was insensitive to histidine but significantly inhibited by betaine (Fig. 4 C). The precursors of betaine, namely betaine aldehyde and choline, showed less inhibition of proline uptake than did betaine. Dimethylglycine, monomethylglycine, and GABA also showed less competition than did betaine for proline uptake mediated by AmT1. Essentially similar competition patterns for proline uptake were obtained for AmT2 (Fig. 4 C). Since proline uptake by LeProT1 was significantly inhibited by betaine aldehyde, choline, and GABA (6Schwacke R. Grallath S. Breitkreuz K.E. Stransky E. Stransky H. Frommer W.B. Rentsch D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 377-392PubMed Google Scholar), the competition patterns for the proline uptake mediated by AmT1 and AmT2 were also different from that of LeProT1. Recently it has been demonstrated that E. coliProP (28Racher K.I. Voegele R.T. Marshall E.V. Culham D.E. Wood J.M. Jung H. Bacon M. Cairns M.T. Ferguson S.M. Liang W.J. Henderson P.J. White G.

Sequence comparison analysis revealed the presence of sterol regulatory element-1 (SRE-1) located 5 bp downstream of the ACCα T3RE. Here, we investigated the role of this SRE-1 in modulating T3 regulation of ACCα transcription. Transfection analyses demonstrated that the SRE-1 enhanced T3-induced ACCα transcription by more than 2-fold in hepatocytes. The effect of the SRE-1 on T3 responsiveness required the presence of the T3RE in its native orientation. In pull-down experiments, the mature form of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) specifically bound the α-isoform of the nuclear T3 receptor (TR), and the presence of T3 enhanced this interaction. A region of TRα containing the DNA-binding domain plus flanking sequences (amino acids 21–157) was required for interaction with SREBP-1, and a region of SREBP-1 containing the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper domain (amino acids 300–389) was required for interaction with TRα. In gel mobility shift experiments, TRα, retinoid X receptor-α, and mature SREBP-1 formed a tetrameric complex on a DNA probe containing the ACCα T3RE and SRE-1, and the presence of T3 enhanced the formation of this complex. Formation of the tetrameric complex stabilized the binding of SREBP-1 to the SRE-1. These results indicate that SREBP-1 directly interacts with TR-retinoid X receptor in an orientation-specific manner to enhance T3-induced ACCα transcription in hepatocytes. T3 regulation of ACCα transcription in nonhepatic cell cultures such as chick embryo fibroblasts is markedly reduced compared with that of chick embryo hepatocytes. Here, we also show that alterations in SREBP expression play a role in mediating cell type-dependent differences in T3 regulation of ACCα transcription.

In livers of birds and mammals, consumption of carbohydrate in excess of the immediate energy requirements of the animal increases the expression of enzymes involved in the conversion of carbohydrate to triacylglycerols (1Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). These enzymes include those in glycolysis, such as glucokinase and l-pyruvate kinase; those in fatty acid synthesis, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α (ACCα) 1The abbreviations used are: ACCacetyl-CoA carboxylaseCEHchick embryo hepatocyte(s)CEFchick embryo fibroblast(s)SREsterol regulatory elementSREBPsterol regulatory element-binding proteinCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseLXRliver X receptorRXRretinoid X receptorNF-Ynuclear factor-YTKthymidine kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseT33,5,3′-triiodothyronineTRnuclear T3 receptorT3RET3 response elementbHLH-Zipbasic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipperMCFAmedium chain fatty acidsPUFApolyunsaturated fatty acidsbpbase pair(s)S14Spot 14. and fatty acid synthase; those in NADPH production, such as malic enzyme; and those in triacylglycerol synthesis, such as glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. For most of the lipogenic enzymes studied, the induction of enzyme levels by dietary carbohydrate is mediated primarily by changes in gene transcription (1Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G.

Several signaling pathways are involved in mediating the stimulatory effects of dietary carbohydrate on lipogenic gene transcription in liver. Increased insulin secretion and glucose metabolism are two important signals mediating this response (1Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Another factor signaling changes in carbohydrate status is the active form of thyroid hormone, 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3). Ingestion of a high carbohydrate meal stimulates a rapid increase in the secretion of thyroxine from the thyroid gland and the conversion of thyroxine to T3 in extrathyroidal tissues (2Gavin L.A. Bui F. McMahon F. Cavalieri R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 49-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gavin L.A. Moeller M. McMahon F.A. Castle J.N. Gulli R. Cavalieri R.R. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The resulting increase in T3 concentration in liver activates the transcription of the genes for ACCα (4Hillgartner F.B. Charron T. Chesnut K.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), fatty acid synthase (5Stapleton S.R. Mitchell D.A. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol.

Ingestion of carbohydrate also increases the levels of nuclear T3 receptors (TRs) in liver (8Burman K.D. Lukes Y. Wright F.D. Wartofsky L. Endocrinology. 1977; 101: 1331-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This phenomenon may also contribute to the stimulation of lipogenic gene transcription by dietary carbohydrate. A role of thyroid hormones in mediating the nutritional regulation of lipogenic enzyme expression is supported by the observation that hypothyroidism in high carbohydrate-fed animals causes a marked reduction in expression of ACCα, fatty acid synthase, malic enzyme, and S14 in liver (9Mariash C.N.

ACC catalyzes the pace-setting step of the fatty acid synthesis pathway (1Hillgartner F.B. Salati L.M. Goodridge A.G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 47-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). There are two ACC isoforms that are encoded by distinct genes. ACCβ (280 kDa) is the major isoform observed in heart and skeletal muscle, where it is thought to function primarily in the regulation of β-oxidation of fatty acids (12Ruderman N.B. Saha A.K. Vavvas D. Witters L.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E1-E18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ACCα (265 kDa) is the principal isoform expressed in tissues that exhibit high rates of fatty acid synthesis such as liver, adipose tissue, and mammary gland. ACCα expression is induced by nutritional and hormonal factors that promote high rates of fatty acid synthesis. For example, feeding previously starved chickens a high carbohydrate, low fat diet stimulates an 11-fold increase in transcription of the ACCα gene in liver (13Hillgartner F.B. Charron T. Chesnut K.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This effect is partially reproduced in primary cultures of chick embryo hepatocytes (CEH) by manipulating the concentration of T3 in the culture medium. The addition of T3 stimulates a 7-fold increase in ACCα transcription in CEH (4Hillgartner F.B. Charron T. Chesnut K.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 337: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The ACCα gene is transcribed from two promoters, resulting in mRNAs with heterogeneity in their 5′-untranslated region (14Kim K.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 77-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These ACCα promoters are designated promoter 1 and promoter 2. The increase in total ACCα mRNA abundance caused by high carbohydrate feeding in chickens and by T3 in CEH is mediated by alterations in the activities of both promoter 1 and promoter 2, with the latter promoter playing a quantitatively greater role in mediating these responses (15Yin L. Zhang Y. Charron T. Hillgartner F.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1517: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Additional studies have shown that the stimulatory effect of T3 on promoter 2 activity is mediated by a T3 response element (T3RE) with unique functional and protein binding properties (16Zhang Y. Yin L. Hillgartner F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 974-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This T3RE enhances ACCα promoter activity both in the absence and presence of T3, with a greater stimulation observed in the presence of T3. The results of DNA binding analyses with nuclear extracts from CEH suggest that the T3-independent enhancer activity of the ACCα T3RE is mediated by the binding of protein complexes containing LXR·RXR heterodimers and that the increase in enhancer activity caused by T3 treatment is mediated by the binding of a different set of protein complexes. One of these complexes contains TR·RXR heterodimers, and another contains LXR·RXR heterodimers. Based on these observations, we have hypothesized that the ACCα T3RE not only mediates T3 regulation of ACCα transcription but also ensures a basal level of ACCα expression for the synthesis of structural lipids in cell membranes. In addition to regulation by nutrients and hormones, ACCα transcription is controlled by tissue- or cell-specific factors. For example, ingestion of carbohydrate has little or no effect on ACCα transcription in heart, kidney, brain, and skeletal muscle (13Hillgartner F.B. Charron T. Chesnut K.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cell type-dependent differences in the regulation of ACCα are also observed in cells in culture. T3 regulation of ACCα transcription in chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF) is markedly diminished compared with that in CEH (17Hillgartner F.B. Chen W. Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12299-12306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for cell type-dependent differences in the regulation of ACCα transcription remain to be determined. Studies analyzing the regulation of other T3-responsive genes have shown that optimal T3 regulation of transcription is dependent not only on the presence of a T3RE but also the presence of accessory elements that bind proteins that are distinct from nuclear hormone receptors (18Fang X. Hillgartner F.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 19Wang Y. Yin L. Hillgartner F.B. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2745-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In isolation, these accessory elements are devoid of T3-responsive activity; they act by enhancing the degree of T3 responsiveness initiated by the T3RE. Some T3 accessory elements bind proteins that are differentially expressed in different cell types and thus play a key role in conferring cell type-dependent differences in T3 responsiveness (18Fang X. Hillgartner F.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 22Park E.A. Song S. Vinson C. Roesler W.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2745-2755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is little information on the mechanism by which T3 accessory elements modulate T3 regulation of transcription. In the present study, we have identified an accessory element that enhances T3 responsiveness of ACCα promoter 2 in CEH. This element is located 5 bp downstream of the ACCα T3RE and binds sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). We have developed data suggesting that SREBP-1 enhances T3 regulation of ACCα transcription by directly interacting with TR·RXR heterodimers bound to the ACCα T3RE. In addition, we provide evidence that alterations in SREBP expression play a role in mediating cell type-dependent differences in T3 regulation of ACCα transcription. DNA fragments used to construct reporter plasmids were named by designating the 5′ and 3′ ends of each fragment relative to the transcription start site of promoter 2 of the ACCα gene. p[ACC−108/+274]CAT has been described previously (16Zhang Y.

This construct contains ACCα sequences between −108 and +274 bp ligated upstream of the CAT gene in KSCAT (24Hodnett D.W. Fantozzi D.A. Thurmond D.C. Klautky S.A. MacPhee K.G. Estrem S.T., Xu, G.

A block mutation of the SRE-1 between −79 and −72 bp was introduced into p[ACC−108/+274]CAT using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy (25Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R.

A full-length cDNA for chicken SREBP-1 was obtained by screening a chicken liver cDNA library (Stratagene) using a human SREBP-1 cDNA probe (nucleotides 721–1103 relative to the start site of translation) and by 5′-RACE. 2Y. Zhang and F. B. Hillgartner, manuscript in preparation.The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this chicken SREBP-1 (GenBankTM accession number AY029224) more closely resembles the 1a isoform than the 1c isoform described for mammalian species (28Yokoyama C.

The data from RNase protection analyses indicate that other forms of SREBP-1 containing variations in the N terminus are not expressed in chicken cells. An expression plasmid encoding the mature form of chicken SREBP-1 was developed by subcloning a SREBP-1 cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–464 into pSV-SPORT1 (Invitrogen) to form pSV-SPORT1-SREBP-1 (1–464). N-terminal and C-terminal truncations of the mature form of SREBP-1 were generated by PCR. PCR products encoding SREBP-1 polypeptides (78–464, 108–464, 238–464, 1–266, 1–340, 1–389, and 300–464) were subcloned into pSV-SPORT1. To generate a plasmid that expresses a fusion protein containing glutathione S-transferase (GST) linked to the mature form of chicken SREBP-1, a SREBP-1 cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–464 was subcloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). The structures of all reporter plasmids and expression plasmids were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and nucleotide sequence analyses. pGEM-3Zf(−)-based plasmids that express full-length chicken TRα (1–408) and N-terminal and C-terminal deletion derivatives of chicken TRα (1–118, 1–157, 21–408, 51–408, and 120–408) have been previously described (19Wang Y. Yin L. Hillgartner F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23838-23848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The construction of a plasmid that expresses a fusion protein containing GST linked to full-length TRα (pGEX-2T-TRα (1–408)) has been described (19Wang Y. Yin L. Hillgartner F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23838-23848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for human RXRα and human LXRα were provided by R. Evans (Salk Institute) and D. Mangelsdorf (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), respectively. Expression plasmids for RXRα and LXRα were developed by subcloning the cDNAs for these receptors into pSV-SPORT1. Primary cultures of CEH were prepared as previously described (29Goodridge A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1924-1931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in serum-free Waymouth's medium MD705/1 containing 50 nminsulin (gift from Eli Lilly Corp.) and 1 μmcorticosterone. CEH were incubated on 60-mm Petri dishes (Fisher) at 40 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The cells were transfected 6 h after plating, using 20 μg of Lipofectin (Invitrogen), 1.3 μg of p[ACC−108/+274]CAT, or an equimolar amount of another reporter plasmid and pBluescript KS(+) to bring the total amount of transfected DNA to 3.0 μg/plate. At 18 h of incubation, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without T3 (1.5 μm). At 66 h of incubation, CEH were harvested, and the cell extracts were prepared as described by Baillie et al. (30Baillie R.A. Klautky S.A. Goodridge A.G. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1993; 4: 431-439Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CAT activity (31Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar) and protein (32Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar) were assayed by the indicated methods. All of the DNAs used in transfection experiments were purified using the Qiagen endotoxin-free kit. CEF were obtained from SPAFAS, Inc. (Norwich, CT) and were routinely cultured in DMEM/M199 (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (25 mm glucose) with medium 199 (Invitrogen) in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio, containing 10,000 units/liter penicillin G, 10 mg/liter streptomycin sulfate, and 25 μg/liter amphotericin B supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum). These cells were transfected with p[ACC−108/+274]CAT or p[ACC−108/+274]CAT containing a block mutation of the SRE-1 using the calcium phosphate method (33Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were seeded on T-75 flasks and grown in DMEM/M199 containing 5% fetal bovine serum until 70% confluent. Twenty-four hours before transfection, the medium was changed to DMEM/M199 containing 50 nm insulin and 1 μm corticosterone. This medium was used throughout the experiment. The cells were transfected with 15 μg of reporter plasmid. Exposure to the calcium phosphate/DNA precipitate was for 16 h. Following transfection, the cells were trypsinized and distributed to 60-mm tissue culture plates. T3 was added to the medium at this time. After 48 h of incubation, the cells were harvested, and the extracts were prepared for CAT and protein assays. All of the procedures were carried out at 4 °C. To prevent proteolysis, a mixture of protease inhibitors (CompleteTM; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was included in all the buffers. The nuclear extracts were prepared from CEH and CEF by a modification of the method described by Dignam et al. (34Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Briefly, CEH from four 100-mm plates or CEF from twelve 100-mm plates were pooled and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting cell pellet was homogenized in buffer 1 (10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) using a 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1100 ×g for 10 min, and the resulting nuclear pellet was washed once in buffer 1. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in Buffer 2 (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). This suspension was rotated for 30 min and then centrifuged 15,000 ×g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was designated as the nuclear extract fraction. The membrane extract fraction was prepared by centrifuging the supernatant of the original 1100 ×g spin for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The resulting membrane pellet was dissolved in Buffer 3 (10 mmTris, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The protein content of the nuclear and membrane extracts was determined as described (32Sedmak J.J. Grossberg S.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). Chicken TRα, human RXRα, and chicken SREBP-1 were translated in vitro using the TNT SP6-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by combining equal amounts of the complementary single-stranded DNA in a solution containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA followed by heating to 90 °C for 2 min and then cooling to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotides were labeled by filling in overhanging 5′ ends using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and/or [α-32P]dGTP. The binding reactions were carried out in 20 μl of 20 mmTris, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol (v/v), 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dI·dC). A typical reaction contained 20,000 cpm (0.1 ng) of labeled DNA and 5 μl of in vitro translated proteins and was performed at 37 °C for 30 min. DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 45 mmboric acid, 1 mm EDTA). Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried and subjected to storage phosphor autoradiography. For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor DNA was mixed with radiolabeled oligomer prior to the addition of nuclear extract. For antibody supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies for 30 min prior to addition of the oligonucleotide probe. A mouse monoclonal antibody against SREBP-1 (IgG-2A4) was obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA). P. Chambon (Strasbourg, France) kindly provided a monoclonal antibody against RXR. A polyclonal antibody that recognizes chicken TR (FL-408) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The synthetic oligonucleotides that were used as probes in gel mobility shift assays are listed in Fig. 1A and in the legend to Fig. 6.Figure 6The interaction between TR α and SREBP-1 is not altered by the binding of these proteins to DNA. GST or GST-SREBP-1 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with in vitro translated and35S-labeled TRα and an equimolar concentration of unlabeled RXRα in the absence and presence of T3. Oligonucleotides (30 ng) containing the ACCα T3RE and/or SRE-1 were included in some incubations as indicated. After the matrix was extensively washed, the labeled proteins retained on the beads were eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by storage phosphor autoradiography together with 10% of the total radiolabeled protein input used in each binding reaction. T3RE-SRE-1 (ACCα sequences between −108 and −66 bp) contains both the ACCα T3RE and SRE-1.T3RE-SRE-1mut contains a mutation of the SRE-1 in the context of the −108 to −66 bp ACCα fragment.T3REmut-SRE-1 contains a mutation of the T3RE in the context of the −108 to −66 bp ACCα fragment. The sequence of T3RE-SRE-1 and T3RE-SRE-1mut is shown in Fig. 1A. The sequence of T3REmut-SRE-1 is 5′-AGGTGGTTGAATGGAGGTAAAGACTCGCATCACACCACCGCGG-3′ (the mutated bases are underlined). Additional experimental details are described in the legend of Fig. 4 and under “Experimental Procedures.” This experiment was repeated twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The proteins in nuclear extract and membrane fractions were subjected to electrophoresis in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using an electroblotting apparatus (Owl Scientific). Immunoblot analyses were performed as described in the Western blotting protocol from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Briefly, the blots were blocked in Blotto (5% nonfat dry milk, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) at 4 °C overnight and then incubated with monoclonal antibody against SREBP-1 (IgG-2A4) or SREBP-2 (IgG-1D2) diluted to 1 μg/ml in Blotto containing 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20. The results of gel mobility shift experiments employing in vitro translated proteins or chicken liver nuclear extracts indicated that IgG-2A4 and IgG-1D2 reacted with the chicken forms of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2, respectively. After incubation with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, the blots were washed in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.01% Tween 20. Next, the blots were incubated with a donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:10,000 in Blotto, 0.01% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS, 0.01% Tween 20, antibody-protein complexes on blots were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Chemiluminescence on the blots was visualized using a FluorChem 8000 imager (Alpha Innotech Corporation), and signals for the precursor and mature forms of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were quantified using FluorChem V200 software. cDNA fragments for chicken SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and β-actin were subcloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). The SREBP-1 cDNA fragment (300 bp) contained sequences between nucleotides 829 and 1128 relative to the start site of translation. The SREBP-2 cDNA fragment (460 bp) was isolated using reverse transcriptase-PCR. The primers used to generate this fragment were based on a SREBP-2 mRNA sequence reported in the GenBankTM data base (accession number AJ310769). The 5′ boundary of this SREBP-2 fragment was defined by the primer sequence, 5′-agcagggcaaccataagcTGA-3′, and the 3′ boundary was defined by the primer sequence, 5′-CAGCCAAACCATCCACCTGT-3′. The β-actin cDNA fragment (256 bp) contained sequences between nucleotides 4 and 259 relative to the start site of translation. Each subclone was linearized with BamHI, and antisense RNA was transcribed with [α-32P]CTP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) using bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase (Promega). Labeled RNAs were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RNA was extracted from CEH and CEF by the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal.

LAO reacted withl-amino acids in an apparent order of Phe > Met, Tyr > Cys, Leu > His ≫ other 11 amino acids tested and produced H2O2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. LAO in milk had a molecular mass of about 113 kDa and was converted to a 60-kDa protein by SDS-PAGE. LAO consisted of two subunits. The N- and C-terminal amino acid sequence determination followed by cDNA cloning showed that the 60-kDa protein consisted of 497 amino acids. LAO mRNA spanned about 2.0 kb, and its expression was found only in the mammary epithelial cells. Glucocorticoid was essential for LAO gene expression. Thus, the LAO gene is expressed acutely upon the onset of milk synthesis. LAO mRNA increased 1 day before parturition, peaked during early to mid-lactation, and decreased at the end of lactation. This is the first demonstration showing that LAO is present in milk. Mastitis is caused by an intramammary bacterial infection. As mouse milk produced H2O2 using endogenous free amino acids, we suggest that LAO, together with free amino acids, is responsible for killing bacteria in the mammary gland. l-Amino acid oxidase (LAO) was purified from mouse milk.

The mammary gland starts milk synthesis at the end of pregnancy to supply milk to the newborn neonate. Milk contains vital nutrients such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, minerals, and vitamins together with bioactive substances including immunoglobulins, bioactive peptides, peptide and steroid hormones, and growth factors (1Clare D.A.

The presence of these substances in milk may confer the biological effect on both the mother and her offspring's survival. Some of these substances begin to be synthesized upon the onset of milk synthesis in the mammary gland. It is well established that prolactin (PRL) 1The abbreviations used are: PRLprolactinLAOl-amino acid oxidasercorrelation coefficientRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsDIGdigoxigeninHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyntnucleotidesMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid is a key hormone to regulate lactose and casein syntheses. PRL is able to stimulate the mammary gland at the end of pregnancy since the PRL receptor gene is expressed half a day before parturition (7Mizoguchi Y. Yamaguchi H. Aoki F. Enami J. Sakai S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 132: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To find the genes expressed highly in the late pregnant mouse mammary gland, mRNA screening was carried out using differential display methods. One cDNA fragment was obtained, and the entire nucleotide sequence from the 5′- to 3′-end was determined in the present experiments. The nucleotide sequence of this cDNA has high similarity to those for snake venom l-amino acid oxidase (LAO) (8Raibekas A.A. Massey V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

LAO catalyzes the oxidative deamination of particular l-amino acids (i.e. Cys, Phe, Met, Leu, Ile, Pro, and Tyr) and converts them into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ammonia, and keto acids (11Blanchard M. Green D.E. Nocito V. Ratner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 155: 421-440Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that administration of LAO isolated from snake venom results in the depletion of murine plasma amino acids such as Phe, Leu, Tyr, Met, Ile, and Val (12Rich J.N. Elion G.B.

The lactating mammary gland almost equally adsorbs all kinds of free amino acids from the circulating plasma in the rat (15Viña J.R. Puertes I.R. Rodriguez A. Saez G.T. Viña J. J. Nutr. 1987; 117: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and sow (16Spincer J. Rook J.A.F. Towers K.G. Biochem. J. 1969; 111: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Except Cys, Gly, and Leu, the milk of a human, baboon, rhesus monkey, horse, cow, and pig contains almost equal amounts of amino acids presented mostly as the protein constituents (17Davis T.A.

Although the concentrations of individual free amino acids in milk are not equally dependent upon the stage of lactation in the human (18Atkinson S.D. Anderson G.H. Bryan M.H. J. Clin.

Gaull G.E. Early Hum. Dev. 1978; 2: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As compared with the amino acid compositions of mouse caseins (21Stevenson E.M. Leaver J. Int.

The presence of LAO in milk remains unknown, but our hypothesis is that the imbalance of the free amino acid composition of milk is due to the LAO-catalyzed reaction of particular amino acids in the mammary gland. Here we demonstrate that mouse milk contains LAO and prove our hypothesis in the present experiments. The physiologically important role of LAO in milk is also discussed. o-Dianisidine was obtained from Tokyo Kasei (Tokyo, Japan); horseradish peroxidase, the amino acid standard solution (Type H), and oxytocin were from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan); the silver staining kit and SDS-PAGE molecular weight markers were purchased from Bio-Rad; Immobilon was from Millipore Japan (Tokyo, Japan); lysylendopeptidase was from Roche Diagnostics; 5′- (version 2) and 3′-RACE systems, SuperScript II reverse transcriptase, oligo(dT) primer, and the RNA size marker were obtained from Invitrogen; EX Taq DNA polymerase was from TaKaRa (Kyoto, Japan); the TA cloning kit was from Invitrogen; the auto cycle sequencing kit and Hybond-N+ membrane were purchased from Amersham Biosciences; restriction endonucleases and RNA polymerases were from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan); the DIG RNA labeling kit, the DIG nucleotide detection kit, and the blocking reagent were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; Isogen was from Nippon Gene (Toyama, Japan); and steroids, amino acids, and the gel-filtration calibration kit were from Sigma. Primers were obtained from Sawady (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals and reagents were from Wako Pure Chemicals. ICR:JCL mice were purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan), maintained at 23 ± 1 °C under a lighting schedule of 14 h (lights on 05:00–19:00 h), and given food and water ad libitum. The day on which a vaginal plug was found was designated as day 0 of pregnancy. The day of parturition was counted as day 0 of lactation. On day 13 of pregnancy, adrenalectomy, ovariectomy, and sham operations were done under pentobarbital anesthesia (23Sakai S. Banerjee M.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 582: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One mg of cortisol or progesterone, dissolved in 0.1 ml of sesame oil, was administered subcutaneously at the completion of the operation (0 h). Milk was collected from lactating mice on day 8 by mild suction under pentobarbital anesthesia. Oxytocin (0.1 unit) was injected intraperitoneally before milking. Skim milk was prepared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Whey was prepared from skim milk by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. All samples were stored at −50 °C until use. The LAO activity was determined by the production of H2O2.o-Dianisidine was dissolved in ethanol at 5 mg/ml. Horseradish peroxidase was dissolved in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) at 40 μg/ml. The assay reagent was freshly prepared and consisted of 1 part o-dianisidine solution and 50 parts peroxidase solution. In the routine assay, l- andd-Leu (200 μm) were used as a positive and negative control, respectively. The sample was mixed with a 2.5-fold volume of the assay reagent. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 120 min unless otherwise indicated in the text. The absorbance (A) was measured at 420 nm (A420) in a spectrophotometer. The LAO activity was expressed on the basis of the o-dianisidine oxidation (A420). Proteins were separated on an AmershamBiosciences FPLC with Superose 12 (HR 16/50) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The elution buffer consisted of 115 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 145 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated using a gel-filtration calibration kit. One ml of whey was applied, and every 1.2-ml fraction was collected. The fraction containing the LAO activity was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0). Ion-exchange chromatography was carried out using an ÅKTA prime on a RESOURCETM Q column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with each fraction set at 0.5 ml. The column was equilibrated with 20 mmTris/HCl (pH 8.0), and the NaCl concentration was increased from 0 to 500 mm for the elution. The fraction containing the LAO activity was stored at −20 °C. The protein concentration was determined by measuring the A280. LAO was denatured in the presence of 2% SDS with 6% 2-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed with 7% acetic acid, 20% methanol for silver staining. The molecular weight of LAO was estimated in comparison with those of SDS-PAGE molecular weight markers. The denatured LAO was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon as described above. The protein band stained with Coomassie Blue was cut out, and amino acid sequence analysis was performed on a Procise 492 protein sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) under the pulse-liquid phase. For the fragmentation of LAO, the band was cut out from the gel stained with Coomassie Blue and digested with lysylendopeptidase for 18 h at 37 °C. The peptide fragments were separated by HPLC on a Puresil C18 column (3.9 × 150 mm) (Waters, Milford, MA) with a linear gradient (0–60%) of 2-propanol:acetonitrile (7:3) in H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 60 min at the flow rate of 1 ml/min. The amino acid sequence analysis of the peptide fractionated by HPLC was performed with a Procise 492 protein sequencing system. Proteins in whey were precipitated by 5% trichloroacetic acid and removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Free amino acids and ammonia were analyzed using a Hitachi L-8500A amino acid analyzer (Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the conversion of amino acids, the amino acid standard solution (Type H) was neutralized with 0.1 n NaOH before the incubation. Amino acids, 125 μm each, were incubated with the test sample at 37 °C. After the incubation, quantities of free amino acids and ammonia were determined as described above. Total RNA was extracted from the third thoracic mammary gland using Isogen. The RNA concentration and protein impurity were determined by measuring the A260 and A260/A280, respectively. Total RNA was transcribed to cDNA at 42 °C for 50 min in the presence of reverse transcriptase and primer using SuperScript II. With cDNA, EX Taq DNA polymerase, and primers, the PCR was cycled 35 times using a TaKaRa TP2000 thermal cycler. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 57 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The last reaction was continued for 10 min at 72 °C. The primers used for the reverse transcription and PCR are given below. Their positions annealed are also indicated in parentheses. For differential display, samples were prepared from the mammary glands on day 16 and 18 of pregnancy. Total RNA was transcribed to cDNA in the presence of oligo(dT) primer. By use of a set of primers (5′-CGACTTGA-3′ and 5′-ATCGTGCC-3′), cDNA was amplified by the PCR. One PCR product with about 1.1 kb was detected in the sample collected on day 18 of pregnancy and sequenced. Based on its partial sequence information, the nucleotide sequence from the 5′- to 3′-end was determined as follow. Total RNA was prepared from the mammary gland on day 18 of pregnancy. For the reverse transcription-PCR, cDNA was synthesized in the presence of the primer 5′-CGACTTGATGGCGGTGTCTA-3′ (antisense I: 1513–1532 nt). cDNA was amplified by the PCR in the presence of 5′-GGATGCTGGTCACGAGGTAA-3′ (sense I: 263–282 nt) and 5′-CTAGCACTGAGGCCAT-3′ (antisense II: 838–853 nt) or in the presence of 5′-CTGATGAAGGAAGGAACGCT-3′ (sense II: 669–688 nt) and 5′-CGACTTGATGGCGGTGTCTA-3′ (antisense I). The two PCR products were used for the DNA sequencing analysis. For the 5′-RACE, cDNA was prepared in the presence of 5′-CATGACTTCTGAGGCACGAT-3′ (antisense III: 487–506 nt). An oligo(dC) was added at the 3′-end using the tailing system supplied with the kit. The first PCR was carried out in the presence of abridged anchor primer (supplied with the kit) and antisense III primer. Nested PCR was performed in the presence of universal amplification primer (supplied with the kit) and 5′-CCAAGTTCTAAGTACCAGCC-3′ (antisense IV: 345–359 nt). DNA obtained by the nested PCR was used for the sequencing analysis. For the 3′-RACE, cDNA was prepared in the presence of (dT)15-adaptor primer (supplied with the kit). The PCR was performed in the presence of (dT)15-adaptor primer and 5′-TAGACACCGCCATCAAGTCG-3′ (sense III: 1513–1532 nt). The PCR product was inserted into the plasmid using a TA cloning kit. The sequence was determined using an ALF DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences) with an auto cycle sequencing kit. All procedures were carried out according to the instructions provided with the kit. The 591-bp DNA, amplified in the presence of sense I and antisense II primers, was subcloned into the plasmid using a TA cloning kit. The plasmid DNA was digested by EcoRV or Hin dIII. The DIG-labeled antisense and sense RNA probes were synthesized using the digested plasmid DNA as a template with SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases, respectively, using a DIG RNA labeling kit. The DIG-labeled RNA probe was used as a detection probe. Five μg of total RNA, dissolved in an electrophoresis buffer (25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 6 mm sodium acetate, and 1.2 mm EDTA) containing 60% formamide and 7.7% formaldehyde, was heated at 65 °C for 10 min. The denatured RNA was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred onto Hybond-N+ membrane. The membrane was incubated overnight with the antisense RNA probe. After incubation with an anti-DIG antibody, signals were detected using a DIG nucleotide detection kit. Ribosomal RNA stained with ethidium bromide was used as an internal standard. In situ hybridization was carried out according to Fujimura et al. (24Fujimura S. Hondo E. Kobayashi T. Inoue N. Nagata S. Watanabe G. Taya K. Kitamura N. Yamada J. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 1998; 60: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In brief, a fresh mammary gland was fixed with paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in paraffin to make a 6-μm section. The deparaffined section was digested with proteinase K. The sections were hybridized with either antisense or sense RNA probes. After washing and blocking, each section was incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody and then with nitroblue tetrazolium salt and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The section was counterstained with methylgreen. The data are expressed as the mean ± SE. The correlation coefficient (r) was determined by the linear correlation analysis. The experiments were repeated three to five times using different milk samples. The concentrations of free amino acids in mouse milk were determined (Table I, column I). Gly, Ala, Ser, and Glu were the most abundant species, and their concentrations were higher than 240 μm. Concentrations of Lys, Val, Thr, and Arg ranged from 67 to 131 μm. All other amino acids (Asp, Leu, Ile, Cys, His, Phe, Met, Tyr, and Trp) were lower than 25 μm. In particular, Met, Tyr, and Trp were less than 5 μm.Table IAmino acid contents of mouse milk (mean ± S.E., n = 5)I. ContentII.

Open table in a new tab Column I, the contents of free amino acids in whey were determined. Column II, whey, added exogenously to a 125 μmconcentration of each amino acid (Type H standard), was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The content was compared with that at 0 h. To examine the conversion of free amino acids in whey, amino acids added exogenously were incubated (Table I, column II). Gly, Ala, Ser, Glu, Lys, Thr, and Ile remained unchanged. Leu, Cys, His, Phe, Met, and Tyr decreased by greater than 60%, and among them, Met, Phe, and Tyr disappeared completely. The apparent decreasing order was Met, Phe, Tyr > Cys, Leu > His ≫ Arg, Val ≫ other amino acids. Amino acids with low contents in milk, shown in Table I (column I), were converted more efficiently and faster than other amino acids (r = −0.585, p = 0.014). As the marker of the LAO activity, the time-dependent production of H2O2 was measured (Fig. 1). LAO in the presence ofl-Leu produced H2O2 in a time-dependent manner, and the H2O2production reached a maximum at ∼120 min. d-Leu showed no effect on the H2O2 production since the amount of H2O2 produced was the same as that in the absence of Leu. The 113-kDa fraction, shown in Fig. 3, was used below as the source of LAO since the high background observed in the absence of Leu (Fig. 1) was no longer observed. LAO produced H2O2 in the presence of l-His, l-Leu, orl-Phe, while in the presence of d-His,d-Leu, or d-Phe, the production of H2O2 was not observed. In the presence ofl-His, l-Leu, or l-Phe at various concentrations, the incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 120 min. At low concentrations between 20 and 100 μm, H2O2 increased linearly as the incubation time progressed (r > 0.95), and the highest production was observed in the presence of l-Phe at any concentration. To obtain the linear relationship between the concentration of amino acid and the A420, the 113-kDa fraction was diluted with a 2-fold volume of H2O and incubated withl-Phe, l-Leu, and l-His (0.4, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 mm). The concentration of amino acid was plotted against the A420 according to the Lineweaver-Burk procedure (data not shown). Each line was linear (r > 0.96). The apparent Km of LAO was 1.0 mm for l-Phe, 8.1 mmfor l-Leu, and 20.2 mm for l-His. The Vmax was in the same order with the A420 of about 3.9. With confirmed amounts and types of amino acids, LAO was incubated for 240 min (Fig. 2). Leu, Cys, His, Phe, Met, and Tyr decreased in a time-dependent manner, while other amino acids remained unchanged. The apparent decreasing order was Phe > Met, Tyr > Leu, Cys > His ≫ other amino acids. During the incubation, the concentration of ammonia increased in a time-dependent manner (data not shown).Figure 2Amino acid species-dependent conversion.

The whey fraction was used since it had the LAO activity. Gel filtration showed that the peak of LAO was detected at the position of apparent Mr 113,000 (Fig. 3). LAO present in the 113-kDa fraction was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 4). LAO was eluted at three different fractions. The high LAO activity was found in fractions I and II. On the protein basis, LAO with the highest purity was obtained from fraction I. SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining showed that fraction I contained one protein species of Mr 60,000 (Fig. 5).Figure 5SDS-PAGE and silver staining of LAO.Lane 1, 113-kDa fraction of gel-filtration chromatography;lane 2, fraction I of ion-exchange chromatography. The positions of SDS-PAGE molecular mass markers are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LAO in fraction I was used for the amino acid sequencing analysis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of LAO was LYENLVK XFQDPDYEAFLLI. Amino acid sequences of lysylendopeptidase-digested peptides were LYENLVK, TYVQK, NPGILGY, YRTDGPTSALHK, and ATRGHTAL. Among them, the peptide fragment ATRGHTAL ended at the last Leu and was identified as the C terminus of LAO. The nucleotide sequence of LAO cDNA is shown in Fig. 6 a. The cDNA consisted of 1941 nucleotides plus poly(A) at the 3′-end. The N-terminal Leu was encoded at nucleotides 111–113. The C-terminal residue was Leu. The CTT codon was present at nucleotides 1599–1601, and coincidentally the TAG termination codon appeared at nucleotides 1602–1604. LAO was encoded at nucleotides 111–1601. The first ATG as the translation start codon was present at nucleotides 33–35. The signal peptide was encoded at nucleotides 33–110. The AATAAA polyadenylation signal was at nucleotides 1643–1648, and the poly(A) tail was present at nucleotide 1942. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA is shown in Fig. 6 b. The amino acid sequences, determined by the amino acid sequencing analysis, were found at positions 27–32, 27–46, 124–128, 160–166, 300–311, and 516–523 of deduced LAO. LAO and its signal peptide consisted of 497 and 26 amino acids, respectively. To examine the tissue- and stage-dependent expression of LAO, the level of LAO mRNA was determined by Northern blot analysis. Total RNA extracted from pregnant mice on day 18 was analyzed (Fig. 7). LAO mRNA in the mammary gland was detected as a clear band with a length of about 2.0 kb, and the faint band, probably corresponding to hnRNA, was present at the position of about 4.6 kb (Fig. 7 a). Except in the mammary gland, no expression was found in the brain, heart, liver, lung, muscle, and placenta (Fig. 7 b). The expression of LAO mRNA was determined in the mammary glands at various stages of pregnancy and lactation (Fig. 8). The expression of LAO mRNA was not detected on day 7 of pregnancy, but the faint band was observed on day 13 of pregnancy. LAO mRNA clearly increased on day 18 of pregnancy (1 day before parturition) compared with that on day 16 of pregnancy. LAO mRNA was expressed throughout lactation, but its expression was weak at the end of lactation. The expression of LAO mRNA was examined by in situ hybridization (Fig. 9). On day 13 of pregnancy, no signal was detected with either antisense (Fig. 9 a) or sense probes (Fig. 9 b). On day 16 of pregnancy (Fig. 9 e, antisense), some of the mammary epithelial cells showed a strong signal, but most epithelial cells had a weak or no positive signal. On day 18 of pregnancy (Fig. 9 f, antisense), all of the mammary epithelial cells showed a strong and positive signal. The alveolus had a narrow lumen on day 13 of pregnancy (Fig. 9, a and b). At 16 h after ovariectomy, the lumen expanded clearly, and numerous milk fat droplets appeared in the mammary gland (Fig. 9, c and d). LAO mRNA increased clearly between 8 and 16 h, peaked at around 24 h, and then decreased considerably (Fig. 10). In situ hybridization (Fig. 9 c, antisense) showed that all of the mammary cells expressed the LAO mRNA, the expression pattern being very similar to that seen in the mammary gland on day 18 of pregnancy (Fig. 9 f). To further determine the progesterone- and/or glucocorticoid-dependent regulation of the LAO gene expression, bilateral ovaries and adrenal glands were removed on day 13 of pregnancy. LAO mRNA was not detected in the ovari-/adrenalectomized mouse mammary gland compared with that in the ovariectomized control. Administration of cortisol increased LAO mRNA, while progesterone showed no effect (Fig. 11). The cDNA encoding mouse milk LAO has a nucleotide sequence similarity of 53.2, 52.7, and 51.1% with cDNAs for snake venom Apoxin 1 (GenBankTM accession number AF093248), snake venom LAO (GenBankTM accession number AF071564), and mouse Fig1 protein (GenBankTM accession number U70429), respectively, as aligned by the Cluster method using the DDBJ program. Recently a cDNA with 508 bp was cloned from the lactating mouse mammary gland (GenBankTM accession number BE850855). The same nucleotide sequence is found in the mouse milk LAO cDNA at nucleotides 1252–1759. FAD is essential in expression of the LAO activity (22Bright H.J. Porter D.J.T. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. XII.

A. 1997; 94: 2507-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was present at nucleotides 207–254. The mouse mammary gland expressed the LAO gene throughout lactation. Changes in LAO mRNA expression during lactation mimic those of γ-casein mRNA expression (26Kim J.Y. Mizoguchi Y. Kuraishi T. Yamaguchi H. Enami J. Aoki F. Imakawa K. Sakai S. Anim. Sci. Technol. 1998; 69: 728-733Google Scholar) and milk production in mice (27Jara-Almonte M. White J.M. J. Dairy Sci. 1972; 55: 1502-1505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2099904610,"We identified a novel Na+-independent acidic amino acid transporter designated AGT1 (aspartate/glutamatetransporter 1). AGT1 exhibits the highest sequence similarity (48% identity) to the Na+-independent small neutral amino acid transporter Asc (asc-type amino acid transporter)-2 a member of the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family presumed to be associated with unknown heavy chains (Chairoungdua, A., Kanai, Y., Matsuo, H., Inatomi, J., Kim, D. K., and Endou, H. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 49390–49399). The cysteine residue responsible for the disulfide bond formation between transporters (light chains) and heavy chain subunits of the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family is conserved for AGT1. Because AGT1 solely expressed or coexpressed with already known heavy chain 4F2hc (4F2 heavy chain) or rBAT (related tob 0,+-amino acidtransporter) did not induce functional activity, we generated fusion proteins in which AGT1 was connected with 4F2hc or rBAT. The fusion proteins were sorted to the plasma membrane and expressed the Na+-independent transport activity for acidic amino acids. Distinct from the Na+-independent cystine/glutamate transporter xCT structurally related to AGT1, AGT1 did not accept cystine, homocysteate, andl-α-aminoadipate and exhibited high affinity to aspartate as well as glutamate, suggesting that the negative charge recognition site in the side chain-binding site of AGT1 would be closer to the α-carbon binding site compared with that of xCT. The AGT1 message was predominantly expressed in kidney. In mouse kidney, AGT1 protein was present in the basolateral membrane of the proximal straight tubules and distal convoluted tubules. In the Western blot analysis, AGT1 was detected as a high molecular mass band in the nonreducing condition, whereas the band shifted to a 40-kDa band corresponding to the AGT1 monomer in the reducing condition, suggesting the association of AGT1 with other protein via a disulfide bond. The finding of AGT1 and Asc-2 has established a new subgroup of the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family whose members associate not with 4F2hc or rBAT but with other unknown heavy chains.

The finding of AGT1 and Asc-2 has established a new subgroup of the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family whose members associate not with 4F2hc or rBAT but with other unknown heavy chains. In the past, a large number of amino acid transport systems in mammals have been distinguished based on differences in substrate selectivity and ion dependence (1Christensen H.N. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 43-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). For the last decade, molecular cloning approaches have revealed the molecular nature of amino acid transport systems (2Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The amino acid transporters identified so far exhibit a variety of substrate selectivity and are composed of the members of several transporter families. Among them, the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family, a subfamily of SLC7, is unique in two aspects (3Verrey F. Meier C. Rossier G. Kuhn L.C. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 503-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kanai Y. Endou H. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). First, the members of this family are linked via a disulfide bond with single membrane spanning type II membrane glycoproteins such as 4F2hc (4F2 heavychain) and rBAT (related tob 0,+-amino acidtransporter) (3Verrey F. Meier C. Rossier G. Kuhn L.C. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 440: 503-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kanai Y. Endou H. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 4F2hc is the heavy chain of the cell surface antigen 4F2 (CD98) (5Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S.

Immunol. 1982; 129: 623-628PubMed Google Scholar). The 4F2 antigen is a heterodimeric protein composed of two subunits, an ∼80-kDa glycosylated heavy chain and a ∼40-kDa nonglycosylated light chain (5Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S.

In addition, a member of the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family has been identified that couples with the other type II membrane glycoprotein rBAT to form a system b0,+amino acid transporter (17Chairoungdua A.

The conserved cysteine residue in the predicted extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 is responsible for the disulfide bond formation between transporter proteins (light chains) and the heavy chains (20Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Second, the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family is distinctive for its diversity in the substrate selectivity of its members. As already mentioned, they include transporters for neutral amino acids (systems L and asc), acidic amino acids as well as cystine (system x− C), and both neutral and basic amino acids (systems y+L and b0,+) (4Kanai Y. Endou H. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified a transporter designated Asc-2 (asc-type amino acid transporter 2) that exhibited relatively low but significant sequence similarity to the members of the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family (21Chairoungdua A. Kanai Y. Matsuo H. Inatomi J. Kim D.K. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49390-49399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Asc-2, however, does not associate with 4F2hc or rBAT and is presumed to link to unknown heavy chains. Although Asc-2 itself is not sorted to the plasma membrane when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the fusion proteins in which Asc-2 is connected with rBAT or 4F2hc appeared on the plasma membrane and exhibits the functional properties corresponding to those of the transporter subserving Na+-independent small neutral amino acid transport system asc (21Chairoungdua A.

In the present study, we have identified a novel transporter protein structurally related to Asc-2. The transporter is also proposed to associate with an additional protein, presumably through a conserved cysteine residue to form a functional complex. We have generated fusion proteins in which the transporter protein is connected with rBAT or 4F2hc and shown that they appear on the plasma membrane and exhibit the Na+-independent transport activity with distinct selectivity for acidic amino acids.

The 1.8-kb XhoI fragment was excised from the cDNA (IMAGE cDNA clone number 1907807), labeled with [32P]dCTP (T7Quick prime;Amersham Biosciences), and used as a probe for screening a mouse kidney cDNA library (22Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library was prepared from mouse kidney poly(A)+ RNA using the Superscript Choice System (Invitrogen) (23Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The synthesized cDNA was ligated to λZipLox EcoRI arms (Invitrogen). Screening of the library and the isolation of positive plaques were performed as described elsewhere (22Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The cDNAs in positive λZipLox phages were rescued into plasmid pZL1 by in vivo excision in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The cDNA insert was subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) at a NotI site. The cDNA was sequenced in both directions by the dye terminator cycle sequencing method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Applied Biosystems). Transmembrane regions of proteins were predicted based on the SOSUI algorithm (24Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were constructed as described elsewhere with some modifications (21Chairoungdua A. Kanai Y. Matsuo H. Inatomi J. Kim D.K. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49390-49399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To generate a AGT1-rBAT fusion protein, AGT1 cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using a sense primer corresponding to nucleotides 4–23 of AGT1 cDNA sequence extended at its 5′ end by adding a Hin dIII restriction site and GCGCG (5′-GCGCGAAGCTTACCTATAGGCAGAAACATTC-3′) and a reverse primer corresponding to the end of the coding sequence extended at its 5′ end by adding a NotI restriction site and ATAT (5′-ATATGCGGCCGCACTTTCTTCATGTATGTGGT-3′). The PCR product was digested with Hin dIII and NotI and ligated to the Hin dIII and NotI sites of a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Mouse rBAT cDNA was amplified using a sense primer corresponding to the coding sequence starting just after the start codon (ATG) extended at its 5′ end by adding NotI restriction site and ATAT (5′-ATATGCGGCCGCAGATGAGGACAAAGGCAAGAG-3′) and a reverse primer corresponding to nucleotides 2228–2251 of mouse rBAT cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number NM009205) (25Segawa H.

The PCR product was digested with NotI and XbaI and then introduced into the vector containing AGT1 (see above) precleaved with NotI and XbaI. The amino acid sequence around the junction of the resultant fusion protein was reduced to EESAAADED. Three amino acids (AAA) were inserted between the C terminus of AGT1 and the N terminus of rBAT in which the first methionine residue was omitted. For the AGT1–4F2hc fusion protein, mouse 4F2hc cDNA was amplified using a sense primer corresponding to the coding sequence starting just after the start codon (ATG) extended at its 5′ end by adding a NotI restriction site and ATAT (5′-ATATGCGGCCGCAAGCCAGGACACCGAAGTGGA-3′) and a reverse primer corresponding to nucleotides 1820–1838 of mouse 4F2hc cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AB023408) (16Fukasawa Y. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Chairoungdua A. Kim D.K. Matsuo H. Cha S.H. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9690-9698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) extended at its 5′ end by adding an XbaI restriction site and GCGC (5′-GCGCTCTAGACATGAGGCAGGGGTGATGTTTT-3′). The PCR product was digested with NotI and XbaI and introduced into the vector containing AGT1 (see above) predigested with NotI and XbaI. The amino acid sequence around the junction of the AGT1–4F2hc fusion protein was reduced to EESAAASQD. Three amino acids (AAA) were inserted between the C terminus of AGT1 and the N terminus of 4F2hc, in which the first methionine residue was omitted. cRNA for AGT1 was obtained by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase for cDNA of AGT1 in pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) linearized with Hin dIII as described elsewhere (26Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). cRNAs for AGT1-rBAT fusion protein and AGT1–4F2hc fusion protein were obtained by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase for cDNAs of AGT1-rBAT fusion protein and AGT1–4F2hc fusion protein in pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) linearized with ApaI. The Xenopus oocyte expression studies and uptake measurements were performed as described previously (27Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hebert S.C. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16561-16568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The uptake of14C-labeled amino acids were measured 2 days after injection of cRNAs. Twenty-five nanograms of cRNAs were injected to each oocyte. For coexpression of AGT1 and mouse 4F2hc or mouse rBAT, 12 ng of AGT1 cRNA and 13 ng of mouse 4F2hc cRNA (16Fukasawa Y. Segawa H. Kim J.Y.

Miyamoto K. Ogura Y. Haga H. Morita K. Katai K. Tatsumi S. Nii T. Taketani Y. Takeda E. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were injected into oocytes. Groups of six to nine oocytes were incubated in 500 μl of standard uptake solution (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) or Na+-free uptake solution in which NaCl in the standard uptake solution was replaced by choline chloride containing 0.5–3.0 μCi of the radiolabeled compounds (12Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19745-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). For Cl−-free uptake solution, Cl− in the standard uptake solution was replaced by gluconate anion. Preliminary experiments to determine the time course of [14C]l-aspartic acid (300 μm) uptake into oocytes expressing the AGT1–4F2hc and AGT1-rBAT1 fusion proteins indicated that the uptake was linearly dependent on incubation time up to 30 min (data not shown). Therefore, in all of the subsequent experiments, the uptake levels were measured over 30 min, and the values were expressed as pmol/oocyte/min. The Km and Vmax values of amino acid substrates were determined using an Eadie-Hofstee plot based on the amino acid uptakes mediated by the AGT1–4F2hc and AGT1-rBAT fusion proteins measured at 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 μm. The amino acid uptakes mediated by AGT1–4F2hc fusion protein or AGT1-rBAT fusion protein were calculated as differences between the means of the uptakes by the oocytes injected with cRNAs for the fusion proteins and those of the control oocytes injected with water. For the uptake measurements in the present study, six to nine oocytes were used for each data point. Each data point in the figures represents the mean ± S.E. of uptake (n = 6–9). To confirm the reproducibility of the results, three separate experiments using different batches of oocytes and in vitro transcribed cRNA were performed for each measurement. The results from the representative experiments are shown in the figures. cDNAs for AGT1 were subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) as described above. cDNAs for mouse 4F2hc and mouse rBAT were also subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) at EcoRI site and at EcoRI and ApaI sites, respectively. For functional expression, 1 μg of these plasmids were solely transfected or cotransfected to COS-7 cells, which were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, by using LipofectAMINETM 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) as described elsewhere (28Mizoguchi K. Cha S.H. Chairoungdua A. Kim D.K. Shigeta Y. Matsuo H. Fukushima J. Awa Y. Akakura K. Goya T. Ito H. Endou H. Kanai Y.

Amino acid uptake measurements were performed at 48 h after transfection as described elsewhere (17Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K. Haga H. Fukui Y. Mizoguchi K. Ito H. Takeda E.

An oligopeptide (CIPDVSDDHIHEES) corresponding to amino acid residues 465–478 of AGT1 was synthesized. The N-terminal cysteine residue was used for conjugation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. An anti-peptide antibody was produced as described elsewhere (29Altman A. Cardenas J.M. Houghten R.A. Dixon F.J. Theofilopoulos A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2176-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The immunofluorescence detection of AGT1 and the epitope of 4F2hc in AGT1–4F2hc fusion protein expressed in Xenopus oocytes was performed as described previously (21Chairoungdua A. Kanai Y. Matsuo H. Inatomi J. Kim D.K. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49390-49399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 2 days after injection of cRNAs, Xenopus oocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer at 4 °C overnight. The samples were dehydrated in graded alcohol series, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 3-μm thick sections that were then deparaffinized and equilibrated with 0.05 m Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. The sections were then treated with 5% goat serum as a blocking agent for 45 min at room temperature and were then washed and incubated overnight with anti-AGT1 antiserum (1:250) or affinity-purified anti-4F2hc antibody (21Chairoungdua A.

Thereafter, they were treated with Alexa FluorTM488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.; diluted 1:200) for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were then washed three times with 0.05 m Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). The images were acquired using an Olympus Fluoview (FV 500) laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). An Argon laser beam was used for excitation at 488 nm for Alexa FluorTM 488 visualization. Emission from Alexa FluorTM 488 was detected via BA505IF filter (30Matsuo H. Tsukada S. Nakata T.

For absorption experiments, the sections were treated with the primary antibodies in the presence of antigen peptides (200 μg/ml) (21Chairoungdua A. Kanai Y. Matsuo H. Inatomi J. Kim D.K. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49390-49399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Three-micrometer paraffin sections of mouse kidney were processed for light microscopic immunohistochemical analysis as described previously (17Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K. Haga H.

For immunostaining, the sections were incubated with anti-AGT1 antiserum (1:1,000) overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, they were treated with Envision (+) rabbit peroxidase (DAKO) for 30 min. To detect immunoreactivity, the sections were treated with diaminobenzidine (0.8 mm) (17Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K. Haga H. Fukui Y. Mizoguchi K. Ito H. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y.

For absorption experiments, the tissue sections were treated with the primary antibodies in the presence of antigen peptides (50 μg/ml) (21Chairoungdua A. Kanai Y. Matsuo H. Inatomi J. Kim D.K. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49390-49399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The protein samples from mouse kidney were prepared as described elsewhere (21Chairoungdua A. Kanai Y. Matsuo H. Inatomi J. Kim D.K. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49390-49399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, the mouse kidney was homogenized in 9 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25 m sucrose, with 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 8,000 ×g, and the supernatant was centrifuged further for 1 h at 100,000 × g. After centrifugation the membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4). The protein samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in the sample buffer either in the presence or absence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was treated with nonfat dried milk and diluted anti-AGT1 antiserum (1:10,000) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as a secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The signals were detected with an ECL plus system (Amersham Biosciences). To verify the specificity of immunoreactions by absorption experiments, the membranes were treated with primary antibodies in the presence of antigen peptides (50 μg/ml) (17Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K. Haga H. Fukui Y. Mizoguchi K. Ito H. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). RNA was prepared from the tissues of 4–5-week-old Jcl:ICR male mice and placenta of mice with late pregnancy by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method using cesium trifluoroacetic acid (Amersham Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA (3 μg/lane) selected by oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) was separated on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 mformaldehyde and was blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell) as described elsewhere (31Kanai Y. Stelzner M.G. Lee W.-S. Wells R.G. Brown D. Hediger M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F1087-F1092PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment of AGT1 cDNA, corresponding to 43–1836 base pairs, was labeled with 32P using theT7QuickPrime kit (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed for 20 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide. The final stringent wash of the filter was performed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C three times for 20 min. A mouse cDNA clone with a 2,141-bp insert was isolated from a mouse kidney cDNA library. It contained an open reading frame from nucleotides 59 to 1,495 encoding a putative 478-amino acid protein, designated as AGT1 (aspartate/glutamate transporter1). The start of the coding sequence was defined by the first ATG and the surrounding sequences (CTCTCAATGG) corresponding to the Kozak consensus translation initiation sequence (32Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). The cDNA includes the poly(A) tail (16 As), which starts 23 nucleotide downstream from a typical polyadenylation signal AATAAA at the nucleotide 2,103. The amino acid sequence of AGT1 was identical to that of BCO14684, which was in a GenBankTMdata base but not functionally characterized. The AGT1 amino acid sequence exhibited remarkable sequence identity to that of mouse system asc transporter Asc-2 (48% identity), which is presumed to be associated with unknown heavy chains (21Chairoungdua A.

https://openalex.org/W2010015057,"The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that regulates physiological processes including Ca2+ metabolism, Na+, Cl−, K+, and H20 balance, and the growth of some epithelial cells through diverse signaling pathways. Although many effects of CaR are mediated by the heterotrimeric G proteins Gαq and Gαi, not all signaling pathways regulated by CaR have been identified. We used human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells that stably express human CaR to study the regulation of inositol lipid metabolism by CaR. The nonfunctional mutant CaRR796W was used as a negative control. We found that CaR regulates phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase, the first step in inositol lipid biosynthesis. In cells pretreated with U73122 to inhibit phospholipase C activation and to block the degradation of PI 4,5-bisphosphate to form [3H]inositol trisphosphate (IP3), CaR stimulated the accumulation of [3H]PI monophosphate (PIP). Additionally, wortmannin, an inhibitor of both PI 3-kinase and type III PI 4-kinase, blocked CaR-stimulated accumulation of [3H]PIP and inhibited [3H]IP3 production. CaR-stimulated inositol lipid synthesis was attributable to PI 4-kinase and not PI 3-kinase because CaR did not activate Akt, a downstream target of PI 3-kinase. CaR associates with PI 4-kinase based on the findings that CaR and the 110-kDa PI 4-kinase β can be co-immunoprecipitated with antibodies against either CaR or PI 4-kinase. The PI-4 kinase in co-immunoprecipitates with anti-CaR antibody was activated in Ca2+-stimulated HEK-293 cells, which stably express the wild type CaR. Pertussis toxin did not affect the formation of [3H]IP3 or the rise in intracellular Ca2+ (Handlogten, M. E., Huang, C. F., Shiraishi, N., Awata, H., and Miller, R. T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem.276, 13941–13948). RGS4, an accelerator of GTPase activity of members of the Gαi and Gαq families, attenuated the CaR-stimulated PLC activation and IP3 accumulation, which is mediated by Gαq, but did not inhibit CaR-stimulated [3H]PIP formation. In HEK-293 cells, which express wild type CaR, Rho was enriched in immune complexes co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-CaR antibody. C3 toxin, an inhibitor of Rho, also inhibited the CaR-stimulated [3H]IP3production but did not lead to CaR-stimulated [3H]PIP formation, reflecting inhibition of PI 4-kinase. Taken together, our data demonstrate that CaR stimulates PI 4-kinase, the first step in inositol lipid biosynthesis conversion of PI to PI 4-P by Rho-dependent and Gαq- and Gαi-independent pathways.

It activates members of the Gαq subfamily to stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) to generate diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) or increase intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) (20Handlogten M.E.

CaR activates a number of intracellular enzymes and kinases, including Src kinase, phospholipase A2, PLC, and phospholipase D in parathyroid and human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells that stably express CaR (12McNeil S.E.

The molecular mechanism(s) of activation or inhibition of these signaling pathways and ion transport systems has not been fully defined. CaR inhibits cell proliferation, an activity that is uncharacteristic of Gαi- and Gαq-coupled receptors, suggesting that it may act via additional pathways (23Lin K-I. Chattopadyay N. Bai M.

In the last two decades, IP3 and DAG, both products of hydrolysis of PI 4,5-P2 by PLC have been defined as second messengers of fundamental importance. Recently individual polyphosphoinositides, originally thought to be simply metabolic intermediates or products, have been recognized as having many specific roles in cell biology (26Osborne S.L. Meunier F.A. Schiavo G. Neuron. 2001; 32: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the biosynthetic pathway leading from PI to PI 4,5-P2, PI 4-kinase carries out the first step resulting in the formation of PI 4-P. PI 4-P is then converted to PI 4,5-P2 by PI 4-P 5-kinase (38Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Besides acting as a substrate for PLC, PI 4,5-P2 plays an important role in the regulation of cellular organelle trafficking (27Mayer A. Scheglmann D. Dove S. Glatz A. Wickner W. Haas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), cytoskeleton rearrangement (28Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev.

PI 3-P, PI 3,4-P2, and PI 3,4,5-P3 can stimulate protein kinase B (Akt), which regulates cell survival through the phosphorylation and inactivation of the Bcl-2 homolog Bad and caspase-9 (34Datta S.R.

These lipids also activate other kinases with 3-phosphoinositide-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, including Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and inducible T-cell kinase (Itk), which activate Src family kinases (36August A.

Although the breakdown of polyphosphoinositides by G protein-coupled receptor-activated PLC has been well established, little attention has been paid to regulation of the earlier steps in polyphosphoinositide synthesis. In the following studies, we investigated the role of CaR in activation of PI 4-kinase using HEK-293 cells that stably express the wild type CaR. We found that CaR activates PI 4-kinase independently of PLC, demonstrating regulation of the first step in polyphosphoinositide synthesis by a G protein-coupled receptor. Additionally, we found that CaR stimulated PI 4-kinase independently of Gαi and Gαq, by a mechanism involving Rho.

HEK-293 cell lines that express pcDNA3, CaR-HApcDNA3, or CaRR796W-HApcDNA3 were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 units/ml penicillin, 5 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.2 mg/ml G418 (13Handlogten M.E. Shiraishi N. Awata H. Huang C.F. Miller R.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F1083-F1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in multiple clones with similar results. Rat-1 cells were cultured in the same medium without G418. HEK-293 cells that stably express either the wild type CaR or the mutant CaRR796W were cultured in 12-well plates and prelabeled with 5–10 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol in 0.5 ml of inositol-free DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 48–50 h. In some experiments, after 24 h of prelabeling, the cells were transiently transfected with LacZpCMV5, Myc-C3 toxin pEF, or MycRGS4pCMV5 using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent for 24 h before experiments. Rat-1 cells were transfected with CaR-HApcDNA3 using the FuGENE 6 reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cultures were starved with serum-free DMEM for 24 h and then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence or absence of either 100 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) or 5 mmCaCl2. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 15 μm wortmannin for 30 min and then incubated with agonist, and the samples were harvested for immunoblotting. After equilibration for 30 min in inositol-free DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 20 mm LiCl in the presence or absence of different concentrations of U73122 or wortmannin, the prelabeled cells in 12-well plates were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in 0.4 ml of equilibration medium in the presence or absence of either 5 mmCaCl2 or 150 μm ATP. The reactions were terminated by adding 0.4 ml of 10% perchloric acid to each well. The plates were stored at 4 °C for 3–5 h, the extracts were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, neutralized by addition of ∼0.32 ml of 1m Hepes (pH 7.4) containing 1 m KOH and 1 mm EDTA, and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were applied to AG1-X8 anion exchange columns, and tritiated inositol-containing compounds were separated as described earlier (39Huang C.F. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The total cellular lipids in the pellets were extracted with chloroform, 1% HCl in methanol, and water (6:6:5.5, v/v/v). The chloroform phase was transferred to glass tubes and evaporated under a N2 steam. The total cellular lipids were separated by TLC and identified by comigration with commercial standards in a solvent system containing chloroform, methanol, 20% methylamide, and 0.1m ammonium hydroxide (40:28:5:2, v/v/v/v) (Ref. 40Tang W. Ziboh V.A. Isseroff R. Martinez M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 90: 37-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 2B). The standards were visualized with iodine vapor, and the areas corresponding to PI and PIP were scraped into scintillation vials and quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. In some experiments in which LacZ, C3 toxin, or RGS4 were transiently transfected into the cells that stably expressed the wild type CaR or mutant CaRR796W, the expression of the transiently expressed protein was documented by immunoblotting of the same samples from which the lipids were extracted. After transfer of the organic phase to glass tubes, the aqueous phase was carefully removed, the protein pellets were washed with acetone once, the pellet was dried with air, 40–50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer were added, and the samples were adjusted to a neutral pH. The samples were boiled for 5 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and processed for immunoblotting with the antibodies indicated. HEK-293 cells were homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 60 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in the same buffer. The protein concentration was determined and adjusted to the same concentration by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting with the antibodies indicated and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. The stable cells were treated with or without 5 mm CaCl2 for 5 min and then lysed by buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% C12E10 (lubrol), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin, benzamidine, and aprotinin. The samples were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 30 min. The protein concentration in cell lysates was determined. Equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were precipitated with antibody against CaR using Dynabeads protein A and Dynal MPC, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For PI-4 kinase immunoprecipitation, the crude membrane fraction described above was extracted on ice for 60 min in buffer A, and the extracts were centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 60 min. The resultant supernatant was processed for immunoprecipitation using antibody against PI-4 kinase β. To attach each of the antibodies to the Dynabeads protein A, 200 μl of Dynabeads protein A were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, the tubes were placed in Dynal MPC for 2 min, and the fluid was removed. 600 μl of monoclonal anti-CaR antibody was added to one tube, and 80 μl of 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 with 20 μl of polyclonal anti-PI 4-kinase β antibody was added to the other. Samples were resuspended with Dynabeads protein A at 4 °C with slow rotation mixing for 30 min. To capture the antibody-loaded Dynabeads protein A, the tubes were placed in Dynal MPC to remove the fluid, and the complexes were rinsed once with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer and resuspended in 210 μl of the same buffer. Each 50-μl aliquot of antibody-loaded Dynabeads protein A was incubated with 1 mg of protein from the cell lysates or membrane extract for 30 min, washed twice to limit nonspecific binding, and the fluid removed by placing the samples in Dynal MPC and aspiration. SDS sample buffer was added to tubes, which were vortexed for 30 s and placed in Dynal MPC. The sample buffer was collected and cooked for 3 min, and then the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using the antibodies indicated. Natural [3H]inositol-PI was prepared by labeling HEK-293 cells at 2-days preconfluence with myo-[3H]inositol (10 μCi/ml in 10% fetal bovine serum and inositol-free DMEM). Total cellular lipids were extracted, and the radiolabeled cellular lipids were separated by TLC. The [3H]inositol-PI fraction was eluted from the silica gel as described previously (41Huang C.F. Wykle R.L. Daniel L.W. Cabot M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16859-16865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The [3H]inositol-PI was >97% pure. The enzymes for the in vitro PI 4-kinase assay were obtained by co-immunoprecipitation using the anti-CaR antibody. The activity of PI 4-kinase was assayed essentially as described by Zhao et al. (42Zhao X-H. Bondeva T. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but modified for the natural [3H]inositol-PI substrate. Briefly, the 200-μl reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 200,000 cpm of natural [3H]inositol-PI, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm ATP, and the immunoprecipitated proteins. The reaction was started by the addition of the reaction mixture to the immunoprecipitation tubes, vortexing the samples, and incubating them at 30 °C for 15 min. Reactions were then terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1% HCl in methanol. The samples were extracted and separated by TLC, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. To investigate the regulation of the phosphoinositide cycle by CaR, we stably expressed the wild type CaR or the nonfunctional mutant CaRR796W in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1A) and measured CaR-stimulated [3H]IP3 production in cells prelabeled with myo-[3H]inositol. Fig. 1B shows the time course of Ca2+o induced [3H]IP3 formation in HEK-293 cells that stably express either the wild type CaR or the nonfunctional mutant CaRR796W. Addition of 5 mmCa2+o to the cells induced a dramatic increase of [3H]IP3 formation that reached a peak at ∼5 min only in the cells expressing the wild type CaR. Fig. 1C shows the dose-response relationship for Ca2+o and [3H]IP3 production over the Ca2+o concentration range of 0–5 mm Ca2+o. Maximal [3H]IP3 formation occurred at 5 min and represented a 3-fold increase over basal at 5 mmCa2+o. Our recent studies showed no effect of pertussis toxin on CaR-stimulated IP3 formation or the rise in Ca2+i (20Handlogten M.E. Huang C.F. Shiraishi N. Awata H. Miller R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13941-13948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This indicates that the regulation of CaR-coupled inositol lipid metabolism is Gi-independent. However, the role of Gαqin the stimulation of IP3 formation by CaR was demonstrated using expression of RGS4 (a Regulator of Gprotein Signaling protein for Gαq family members) to attenuate Gαq activation (20Handlogten M.E. Huang C.F. Shiraishi N. Awata H. Miller R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13941-13948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PLC, which is activated by many signaling pathways, is a key enzyme in the catabolism of PI 4,5-P2 to produce IP3 and DAG. The level of PI 4,5-P2 and consequently its availability as a substrate for PLC, depends on its rate of synthesis by PI 4-kinase and PI 4-P 5-kinase as well as its rate of degradation by PLC. To determine whether a signal originating from CaR regulates PI kinases and consequently the supply of PI 4,5-P2, we used U73122, a specific inhibitor of PLC, to block catabolism of PI 4,5-P2. The cells were pretreated with different concentrations of U73122 (0–5 μm) and then incubated with 5 mm Ca2+o for 5 min. Fig. 2A shows that U73122inhibits [3H]IP3 formation in a dose-dependent manner, with nearly complete inhibition at 5 μm, the maximum concentration. To demonstrate activation of PI kinase activity by CaR, the total cellular lipids from the same samples shown in Fig. 2A were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography as shown in Fig. 2B, and the formation of [3H]phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP) was measured. In a dose-dependent manner, U73122 led to the accumulation of [3H]PIP in response to activation of CaR (Fig. 2C) with a maximum effect at ∼1 μm. These results demonstrate that CaR stimulates the activities of PI kinases that lead to the accumulation of [3H]PIP when its subsequent catabolism is blocked. Genetic and biochemical studies have led to the classification of PI kinases in three general families, PI 3-kinase (type I) and PI 4-kinase (types II and III). Wortmannin, a fungal metaboli"

Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) uracil-DNA glycosylase. Central to the current understanding of the enzyme mechanism is the observation that the target uracil must be extracted from the DNA helix with the uracil-containing nucleotide rotated ∼180° about the phosphodiester backbone to enter the active site (12Parikh S.S. Putnam C.D. Tainer J.A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 183-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Co-crystal structures of the human enzyme bound to excision products show three distinctive structural features thought to be characteristic of the catalytic mechanism: 1) distortion of the DNA backbone imposed by a “pinching” action of a trio of serines, 2) displacement of the scissile uracil base from helical space of the DNA helix by the insertion of a conserved leucine side chain into the minor groove of the DNA, and 3) capture of the “flipped out” uracil by a binding pocket on the protein designed to stabilize the expelled uracil (5–7,12). These observations have led to the proposal of a “pinch-push-pull” mechanism to describe the sequential steps associated with uracil capture in the active site. This paradigmatic model hypothesizes that the serine-pinch induces stress on the DNA structure, which is relieved when Leu191 of Ung is inserted to push the uracil out of the base stack in the DNA helix, thereby allowing it to be pulled into the active site. E. coli uracil-DNA glycosylase 2-aminopurine 2′-β-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine PSB2 uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein Nucleotide flipping is not unique to the uracil-DNA glycosylase reaction mechanism of Ung (13Roberts R.J.

Cell. 1994; 76: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Although the reactions catalyzed by these diverse enzymes are clearly different, a common mechanism of nucleotide flipping has been proposed (13Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 181-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 14Hornby D.P. Ford G.C. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Cheng X.

However, the pinch-push-pull reaction sequence for nucleotide flipping proposed for Ung appears inconsistent with structural data for the HhaI methylase. For example, O'Gara et al. (19O'Gara M. Horton J.R. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 872-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) observed a “flipped-out” configuration of the deoxyribose-phosphate backbone in co-crystals of HhaI methylase bound to DNA despite replacement of the target cytosine residue of the recognition sequence with an abasic site. This observation shows clearly that nucleotide flipping can occur in the absence of a base to be pushed, suggesting that the ultimate driving force for the flipping must therefore be derived from DNA backbone distortion. Because it is difficult to resolve a dynamic question of reaction sequence from static protein structures, direct kinetic measurement of the rates for the pushing and pulling steps of nucleotide flipping and leucine insertion must be obtained. Stivers et al. (20Stivers J.T. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) reported such a study using stopped-flow fluorometry to investigate the kinetics of nucleotide flipping and leucine-insertion of the E. coli Ung during binding to an oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing a reporter fluorophore, 2-aminopurine, positioned adjacent to a non-cleavable analog of uracil, 2′-β-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine. With this substrate-analog, identical rates of nucleotide flipping and leucine insertion were observed that led to the conclusion that pushing and pulling must both occur simultaneously. However, Handa et al. (21Handa P. Roy S. Varshney U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17324-17331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and Jiang and Stivers (22Jiang Y.L. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7710-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) recently reported kinetic parameters for the excision of uracils from a single-stranded DNA substrate, which showed a 15-fold reduction in kcat/Km between the wild-type and a L191A mutant E. coli Ung. If the role of the Leu insertion were to facilitate uracil flipping by pushing the scissile base out of the structural cage of the double helix, then it is difficult to rationalize why the L191A mutation should have such a pronounced effect on the excision of a uracil from a single-stranded DNA substrate where the steric impediments to flipping imposed by the duplex DNA structure are absent. These results suggest that the leucine insertion step likely plays a more complex role than that of a simple piston designed to dislodge a recalcitrant uracil base from the double helix. In this report, we present the result from a combination of rapid chemical-quenched-flow and stopped-flow fluorometry studies that evaluated the presteady-state kinetics of the entire catalytic mechanism from binding through nucleotide flipping, leucine insertion, uracil excision, and product release using a uracil-containing duplex oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrate. A global, computer-simulated fit of all kinetic data to a single minimal reaction mechanism and a unique set of microscopic rate constants are presented. The structural data will be discussed in the context of the kinetic model to further elucidate the temporal and dynamic relationships between the static structures. Comparison of similarities and differences of our results to those of Stivers and coworkers (23Drohat A.C. Xiao G. Tordova M. Jagadeesh J. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Gilliland G.L. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11876-11886Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using the non-cleavable uracil analog will be discussed with regards to clarifying the role of leucine insertion in facilitating the catalysis of excision. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). All buffers were made from reagent grade chemicals. All kinetic experiments were carried out in buffer A containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% (w/v) glycerol. For stopped-flow experiments, spectrometric grade glycerol (EM Science) was used. E. coli Ung was purified as Fraction V from JM105/pSB1051 as described by Sanderson and Mosbaugh (24Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29170-29181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The purified Ung had a specific activity of 1.2 × 106units per milligram of protein as determined by the release of [3H]uracil from activated calf thymus DNA (25Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A final enzyme stock of 24.6 μm, as determined spectrophotometrically using ε280 = 4.22 × 104 m −1 cm−1, was stored until needed in buffer A at −80 °C. Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides, U-27-mer (5′-GGGGCTCGTACAAGGAAUTCGTCTACC), A-27-mer (5′-CCCCGGTAGACGAATTCCTTGTACGAG), and 2AP-27-mer (5′-CCCCGGTAGACGA-2AP-TTCCTTGTACGAG) were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). The concentrations of single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides were determined spectrophotometrically using ε260 of 2.59 × 105 m −1 cm−1, 2.58 × 105 m −1cm−1, and 2.49 × 105 m −1 cm−1 for U-27-mer, A-27-mer, and 2AP-27-mer, respectively. The U-27-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide was 5′-end 32P-labeled as described previously by Bennett et al. (26Bennett S.E. Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6109-6119Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Duplex oligodeoxyribonucleotides, U:A-27-mer and U:2AP-27-mer, were hybridized at a 1:1.1 molar ratio with the A- or 2AP-containing oligodeoxyribonucleotide in slight excess in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate. Annealing was carried out by heating the samples to 70 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The extent of annealing (>95%) was ascertained by native gel electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide (26Bennett S.E. Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6109-6119Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50 luminescence spectrometer (excitation and emission slit widths of 10 mm, 5-mm path length, at 25 °C). Excitation spectra (250–350 nm) were collected by monitoring emission at λem = 370 nm whereas emission spectra (330–500 nm) were collected by excitation at λex= 310 nm. Fluorescence titrations and time courses were performed at λex = 310 nm and λem = 370 nm. Single-turnover and active site titration experiments were performed using a KinTek RFQ-3 Rapid Chemical Quench (KinTek Instruments, State College, PA) instrument maintained at a constant 25 °C with a Neslab RTE-111 refrigerated water bath. Reactions were initiated by rapidly mixing 15 μl of Ung with 15 μl of 5′-32P-U:2AP-27-mer substrate. Reactions were then chemically quenched with 90 μl of quench solution containing 6 m NaOH, 4 m guanidine thiocyanate. Samples were immediately diluted 2-fold in distilled water, vortexed, and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h to cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA at abasic sites. After cleavage, the samples were diluted 5-fold in distilled water and analyzed using a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide/8.3 m urea gel (26Bennett S.E. Sanderson R.J. Mosbaugh D.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6109-6119Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled substrate and product oligodeoxyribonucleotide bands were visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuaNT 5.0 (Molecular Dynamics). A t = 0 sample was obtained by mixing buffer instead of enzyme solution with substrate, and a t = ∞ point was obtained at 30 s to determine the maximum extent of attainable product. The concentration of excised uracil at time t, [P]t, was calculated according to Equation 1, [P ]t=[DNA ]0x [IP,t/(IS,t+IP,t)]−[IP,0/(IS,0+IP,0)][IP,∞/(IS,∞+IP,∞)]−[IP,0/(IS,0+IP,0)]Equation 1 where [DNA]0 represents the initial concentration of DNA substrate, I denotes the intensities of bands, the subscripts P and S refer to product and substrate, respectively, and the subscripts, t, 0, and ∞, denote reaction times. Single-turnover time courses with enzyme present in excess over substrate were fitted to a single exponential according to Equation2,[P ]t=A1(1−e−kobst)Equation 2 while active-site titration experiments with excess substrate were fitted to a single exponential followed by a line according to Equation 3,[P ]t=A1(1−e−kobst+ksst)Equation 3 where A1 and kobsdenote the amplitude and the apparent rate constant of the exponential phase and kss denotes the linear steady-state rate constant. The dependence of kobs on [Ung] was fitted according to Equation 4, kobs=kexKD+[E ]0+[D ]0−(KD+[E ]0+[D ]0 )2−4[E ]0[D ]02[D ]0Equation 4 where kex and KD denote the kinetic rate constant for excision and the equilibrium dissociation constant for substrate DNA binding, respectively. [E]0 and [D]0 are initial concentrations of enzyme and DNA, respectively. Pulse-trap experiments were performed using the KinTek RFQ-3 Rapid Chemical Quench apparatus in the double-mixing mode. The reactions were initiated as described above but were mixed with 90 μl of 30 μm Ugi instead of the quench solution. Reactions were then allowed to proceed an additional 500 ms before addition of 90 μl of quench solution (6 mNaOH and 4 m guanidine thiocyanate). DNA reaction products were alkaline-cleaved and analyzed as described above. Stopped-flow fluorescence experiments were carried out using a pneumatically driven KinTek SF 2001 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (KinTek Instruments, State College, PA) fitted with either a 100-watt mercury arc lamp (Osram HBO 100 W/2) for monitoring 2AP fluorescence using a λex of 310 nm or a 75-watt xenon arc lamp (Ushio UXL-75XE) for monitoring protein fluorescence using a λexof 290 nm. All reactions were performed in buffer A and maintained at a constant 25 °C with a Neslab RTE-111 refrigerated bath. Fluorescence emission of 2AP was monitored using a >350-nm long pass filter (Corion LG-350-F). Protein fluorescent emission was monitored using either a >325-nm long pass filter (Oriel #51960) for non-fluorescent DNA samples or a 340-nm bandpass filter (Corion P10-340-F) to minimize interference from 2AP fluorescence when necessary. Stopped-flow traces were initially fitted to sums of exponentials. However, the multiphasic (≥3) nature of the typical trace precluded accurate resolution of the individual exponentials. These exponential fits were therefore used only to obtain initial estimates of reaction rate constants for the global simulation and are not shown. Accurate modeling of all stopped-flow traces was obtained by kinetic simulation using the software KinTekSim (Kintek Corp.) version of KinSim and KinFit (27Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 28Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) using a single reaction mechanism with a single set of rate constants and output factors. The duplex U:2AP-27-mer consisted of a uracil-containing oligodeoxyribonucleotide, U-27-mer, annealed to the complementary and fluorescent 2-aminopurine (2AP) containing 2AP-27-mer. The resulting duplex DNA contained a single uracil at position 18 from the 5′-end of U-27-mer that was positioned directly across from the 2AP base of the 2AP-27-mer. This substrate was designed to take advantage of the fluorescence properties of the 2AP base for detecting the uracil flipping reaction during catalysis. The fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of the single-stranded 2AP-27-mer (Fig. 1 A) showed the characteristic excitation and emission maxima of 310 and 370 nm, respectively. The observed emission spectra (λex = 310 nm) of a 400 nm solution of 2AP-27-mer showed linear, incremental loss of fluorescence upon addition of increasing concentrations of the complementary, uracil-containing oligodeoxyribonucleotide, U-27-mer up to an equimolar concentration of 400 nm as expected (Fig. 1 B). Addition of excess U-27-mer apparently resulted in no further quenching. Spectra were collected 10 min following each addition of U-27-mer. Time courses of the observed fluorescence at the maximum emission wavelength of 370 nm after each addition of U-27-mer showed no further change in fluorescence after 10 min (Fig. 1 C). The quantitative correlation between the observed fluorescence quenching of the 2AP-27-mer upon duplex formation is consistent with literature reports of 2AP as a sensitive probe for the single-stranded nature of its microenvironment within duplex DNA (20Stivers J.T. Pankiewicz K.W. Watanabe K.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,29Raney K.D. Sowers L.C. Millar D.P. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6644-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 30Rachofsky E.L. Seibert E. Stivers J.T. Osman R. Ross J.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 31Stivers J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3837-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and confirms the usefulness of the resultant duplex, U:2AP-27-mer, as a stopped-flow probe for detecting uracil flipping. To measure the rate of uracil excision at the enzyme active site, a single-turnover assay was performed in a rapid chemical quenched-flow apparatus using 2 μm 5′-32P-U:2AP-27-mer and 2 μm Ung. At various times up to 200 ms, a quench solution containing 6 m NaOH and 4 m guanidine thiocyanate was added. Enzymatically generated abasic sites within the oligodeoxyribonucleotide product were cleaved by incubation at 55 °C for 1 h, and the cleaved products were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide/8.3 m urea denaturing sequencing gel. Radioactive bands corresponding to the 32P-U-27-mer strand of the substrate and the 32P-17-mer product were visualized (Fig. 2 A) and quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Two secondary product bands were observed migrating slightly slower than the expected 17-mer product when alkaline cleavage was carried out in the presence of guanidine or urea while a single 32P-17-mer product band was observed when the reactions were quenched in 6 m NaOH alone. However, the guanidine thiocyanate was essential for efficient quenching of the reaction as control experiments showed that 6m NaOH alone failed to quench the Ung-catalyzed reaction at times <10 ms (data not shown). These extra bands were therefore attributed to alternate chemical mechanisms of abasic site cleavage catalyzed by the guanidine. When the radioactivity contained in all product bands was summed to assess the total amount of uracil excised from the 32P-U:2AP-27-mer, a time-dependent conversion of the 27-mer to the 17-mer product was observed. Fig. 2 B shows the results from a series of such rapid quench reactions performed at 10 nm5′-32P-U:2AP-27-mer and excess Ung ranging from 20 to 500 nm. Time course profiles at each concentration are shown (Fig. 2 B, inset) together with the non-linear least-squares best fit of each data set to a single exponential to yield observed rate constants, kobs, at each concentration of Ung. The dependence of kobs on Ung concentration was best described by a quadratic Langmuir binding curve (Equation 4) with an asymptotic maximal limit representing the maximal rate constant for excision, kex, of 38 s−1 and a corresponding dissociation constant,KD, of 38 nm. To examine the relationship between the first catalytic turnover and the steady state, active site titration experiments were performed at 2 μmUng with 0.5 μm (substoichiometric) to 3 μm(excess) 5′-32P-U:2AP-27-mer. The amount of product formed as a function of time at each concentration is shown in Fig. 3 A. At substoichiometric substrate concentrations, the time courses were best fitted to a single exponential with a DNA concentration-independent rate constant,kobs, of 38 s−1 and amplitudes that increased with increasing concentration of DNA. At higher DNA concentrations (≥2 μm) where substrate was in excess of Ung, the amplitude of the exponential “burst” phase (1.76 μm) became independent of DNA concentration (kobs = 38 s−1) and a much slower linear phase became apparent with a corresponding rate constant of 0.5 s−1, which is consistent with the measured (data not shown) and reported values (21Handa P. Roy S. Varshney U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17324-17331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Drohat A.C. Jagadeesh J. Ferguson E. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11866-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) of the steady-state kcat. The high concentration of Ung (2 μm) in large excess over the KD of 38 nm was chosen for this experiment to ensure stoichiometric binding of substrate. Under these conditions, the burst amplitudes of the exponential phase directly measures the molar concentration of productively filled active sites in the first turnover, consistent with the concentration-independent maximal excision rate constant observed. A plot of the amplitudes divided by the total Ung concentration as a function of DNA concentration, therefore, represents a stoichiometric titration of the fraction of catalytically active enzyme present. Such an active site titration plot (Fig. 3 B) showed a linear increase with concentration up to a maximum plateau value of 0.88 upon addition of an equimolar amount of 2 μm DNA, indicating that 88% of the Ung preparation was catalytically active. To investigate the internal dynamics of steps leading up to bond cleavage, a pulse-trap experiment was performed. This experiment is analogous to the pulse-chase experiment (33Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 34Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 35Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 36Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3115-3125Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in which a reaction time course obtained by adding a “chase” solution of excess unlabeled substrate at various times is compared with a parallel time course where a denaturing quench solution is added instead. Because the addition of the chase solution does not denature the enzyme but does prevent the detection of any additional DNA binding or re-binding, enzyme-bound substrates at the active site can proceed toward additional product formation provided it does so prior to dissociation from the active site as substrate. In contrast, the addition of a denaturing quench effectively precludes additional “flux.” The difference between the two parallel time courses, therefore, is a direct reflection of the relative probabilities of forward versus reverse flux for the bound substrate. The pulse-trap experiment relied on the same approach with the exception that a solution of the PBS2 uracil-glycosylase inhibitor protein, Ugi, was used in place of the chase solution to selectively bind to free Ung and thereby prevent any re-binding of DNA substrates (25Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22512-22521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ugi protein has been shown previously to inhibit Ung activity by forming an essentially irreversible 1:1 complex by acting as a DNA mimic and associating with the DNA binding site of Ung (4Putnam C.D. Shroyer M.J. Lundquist A.J. Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Mosbaugh D.W. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 25Bennett S.E. Mosbaugh D.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26879-26885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In two parallel sets of reactions, Ung (2 μm) was reacted with 5-32P-U:2AP-27-mer (1 μm) and terminated at various times either with a 30 μm Ugi “trap” solution or with the 6 mNaOH/4 m guanidine thiocyanate “quench” solution. Quench was added to the Ugi-trapped reactions after an additional 0.5 s to ensure adequate time for complete flux to occur. Following alkaline cleavage, denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, imaging, and quantitation, the extent of cleaved products in each series of parallel reactions was plotted as shown in Fig. 4 A. The “quenched” reaction showed the expected single-exponential time course with the expected kex = 38 s−1. However, the “trapped” reaction showed an excess of products in the earliest time points, which extrapolated to a y-intercept value comparable to 33% of the bound DNA. Fig. 4 B provides an illustration of the rationale behind the interpretation of these results in terms of the forward and reverse flux of an enzyme-bound substrate complex. In the quenched reaction, products appeared at the excision rate of 38 s−1. With the addition of the Ugi trap solution at various time points, free Ung was sequestered and prevented from binding or re-binding substrate, but the DNA substrate-bound enzyme continued to be converted into products. Dynamic interchange of bound and free substrate pools were silent in the quenched assay but become apparent in the trap assay because only those bound substrate molecules that did not dissociate would be converted to additional product. Because the reaction conditions were chosen to ensure rapid equilibrium binding of DNA substrate as indicated by the maximal kex of 38 s−1, the Ugi solution should have been able to trap up to 100% of the bound DNA, if bound substrate did not dissociate prior to excision. The observed 33% trapping of bound DNA, therefore, reflects a net forward flux of 0.33 per binding event. Beca"

Moreover, addition of chloroacetylated biotin inhibited lipid accumulation, as judged by Oil Red O staining. Our results support recent studies that indicate that acetyl-CoA carboxylase may be a suitable target for an anti-obesity therapeutic. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the first committed step in the synthesis of long chain fatty acids.

Obesity is characterized by an increase in the number and size of adipocytes (1.Flier J.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 15-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). During the course of adipogenesis the activities of several lipogenic enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and ATP citrate lyase are increased (2.Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Polakis S.E. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6462-6464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The up-regulation of these enzymes suggests they could be targets for anti-obesity agents. For example, it has been shown recently that mice treated with inhibitors of fatty acid synthase resulted in decreased food intake and weight loss (3.Loftus T.M. Jaworsky D.E. Frehywot G.L. Townsend C.A. Ronnett G.V. Lane M.D. Kuhajda F.P. Science. 2000; 288: 2379-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that acetyl-CoA carboxylase could be a target for anti-obesity agents was strengthened by a recent study demonstrating that mice lacking the gene coding for the mitochondrial isoform of acetyl-CoA carboxylase lost weight despite eating more food (4.Abu-Elheiga L. Matzuk M.M. Abo-Hashema K.A.H. Wakil S.J. Science. 2001; 291: 2613-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated a pharmalogical regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity and inhibition of adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a biotin-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the following two-step mechanism. The first half-reaction is carried out by the biotin carboxylase component of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and involves the ATP-dependent carboxylation of biotin with bicarbonate serving as the source of CO2. The carboxyl group is transferred from biotin to acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA in the second half-reaction, which is catalyzed by carboxyltransferase. For both half-reactions, biotin remains covalently linked to the enzyme through an amide bond to a specific lysine residue of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein and is designated as enzyme-biotin in the reaction scheme. Mammalian acetyl-CoA carboxylase contains all three components on a single polypeptide (5.Tanabe T. Wada K. Okazaki T. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have recently synthesized a bisubstrate analog inhibitor of the carboxyltransferase component of bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Fig. 1) (6.Levert K.L. Waldrop G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since human acetyl-CoA carboxylase is now a target for anti-obesity drugs, the question arose as to whether the bisubstrate analog we synthesized would inhibit mammalian acetyl-CoA carboxylase and in turn act to reduce lipid accumulation. Unfortunately, the bisubstrate analog contains the nucleotide ADP and therefore is not permeable to the cell membrane. However, the precursor to the analog, achloroacetylated biotin derivative (CABI) 1The abbreviations used are: CABIachloroacetylated biotin derivativePPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serumSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionHRPhorseradish peroxidaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMIX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthineDEXdexamethasone1The abbreviations used are: CABIachloroacetylated biotin derivativePPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serumSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionHRPhorseradish peroxidaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyMIX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthineDEXdexamethasone (Fig. 1), is sufficiently hydrophobic to diffuse across the cell membrane. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with CABI inhibits the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Moreover, we have shown that CABI treatment inhibits the adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells by blocking the induction of PPARγ and other adipocyte transcription factors. achloroacetylated biotin derivative peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum signal transducers and activators of transcription horseradish peroxidase high performance liquid chromatography 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine dexamethasone achloroacetylated biotin derivative peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum signal transducers and activators of transcription horseradish peroxidase high performance liquid chromatography 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine dexamethasone Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Invitrogen. Bovine and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Sigma and Invitrogen, respectively. PPARγ was a mouse monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. STAT antibodies were monoclonal IgGs purchased from Transduction Laboratories or polyclonal IgGs from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Streptavidin linked to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was from Pierce. HPLC was performed using a Waters HPLC system equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Analytical HPLC used a Discovery C-18 column (15 cm × 4 mm, 5 μm) purchased from Supelco. All other reagents were from Sigma or Aldrich. Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were plated and grown to 2 days postconfluence in DMEM with 10% bovine serum. Medium was changed every 48 h. Cells were induced to differentiate by changing the medium to DMEM containing 10% FBS, 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (MIX), 1 μm dexamethasone (DEX), and 1.7 μm insulin. After 48 h this medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and cells were maintained in this medium until utilized for experimentation. CABI was dissolved in Me2SO and added to the cell culture medium at a 1 to 1000 dilution. Vehicle additions were performed in every experiment. Synthesis of chloroacetylated biotin was as described previously (7.Amspacher D.R. Blanchard C.Z. Fronczek F.R. Saraiva M.C. Waldrop G.L. Strongin R.M. Org. Lett. 1999; 1: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Monolayers of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in a nondenaturing buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 50 trypsin inhibitory milliunits of aprotinin, 10 μmleupeptin, and 2 mm sodium vanadate for Western blot analysis. Samples were extracted for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Supernatants containing whole cell extracts were analyzed for protein content using a BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This procedure was modified to prepare extracts for enzymatic analysis. The nondenaturing buffer contained 150 mm KCl, instead of NaCl, and there was no Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, or any protease or phosphatase inhibitors included in the buffer. The cell monolayers were scraped in this buffer and were homogenized with 16 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 5 min, and the supernatants were saved as cytosolic extract and used to assay acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity. Proteins were separated in 5, 7.5, or 12% polyacrylamide (acrylamide from National Diagnostics) gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) according to Laemmli (8.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked in 4% milk for 1 h at room temperature. Results were visualized with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) or streptavidin linked to HRP and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase from 3T3-L1 cell lysates was determined using a fixed time assay. Assays were performed by measuring the loss in acetyl-CoA and/or the production of malonyl-CoA at 5 min intervals for 20 min, using reverse phase HPLC. The rate of conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA was found to be linear for 20 min, and velocities were calculated by linear regression analysis of the malonyl-CoA concentration with respect to time. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 6 μm acetyl-CoA, 2 mm ATP, 7 mmKHCO3, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cell lysates were preincubated (30 min, 25 °C) with bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml) and potassium citrate (10 mm). Reactions were initiated by transferring 50 μl of preincubated cell lysate to the reaction mixture (final volume 200 μl) and incubated for 5–20 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of 50 μl 10% perchloric acid. Following termination of the reaction the samples were centrifuged (3 min, 10,000 × g) and analyzed by HPLC. A mobile phase of 10 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.7 (solvent A), and MeOH (solvent B) was used. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min, and the gradient was as follows: hold at 100% solvent A for 1 min followed by a linear gradient to 30% solvent B over the next 5 min, then hold at 30% solvent B for 5 min. Using this method the retention times were 7.5 and 9.0 min for malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, respectively. To test the ability of CABI to reduce acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated for 4 h with 10 μm CABI, and whole cell extracts were prepared and immediately used to measure acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity by analytical reverse phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase from cells treated with CABI was 0.30 nmol of malonyl-CoA/min·mg, and cells treated with Me2SO had an activity of 1.40 nmol/min·mg. Thus, treatment of preadipocytes with CABI resulted in a 79% reduction in acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity. These samples were also analyzed for the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase using streptavidin HRP (Fig. 2 B). These results clearly demonstrate that the reduced activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase is not due to altered expression levels of the enzyme. Since treatment of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with CABI reduced acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, we examined the effects of CABI on the adipogenesis of these cells. At 2 days postconfluence, the 3T3-L1 cells were exposed to the normal differentiation mixture (FBS, MIX, DEX, and insulin) for 48 h in the presence or absence of various doses of CABI. After 48 h, the cells were maintained in 10% FBS in DMEM. A vehicle addition of Me2SO was also performed. CABI or Me2SO was added to the cells in a 1 to 1000 dilution into the cell culture medium every 24 h. The isolation of whole cell extracts and Oil Red O staining was performed 1 week following treatment with the induction mixture. Adipogenesis was assessed by examining the expression of several transcription factors, PPARγ and STATs 1 and 5A, which are highly induced during adipogenesis (9.Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar), and by examining lipid accumulation, as judged by Oil Red O staining. Optimal differentiation, as judged by PPARγ expression and Oil red O staining, was achieved when 3T3-L1 cells were exposed to the normal differentiation mixture containing FBS, MIX, DEX, and insulin, which resulted in 100% adipocyte conversion as reported previously (10.Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 15: 168-181Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). However, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of differentiation in the presence of CABI. Exposure of differentiating adipocytes to 17 or 8 μm CABI blocked the induction of PPARγ expression (Fig. 3) and lipid accumulation as judged by Oil Red O staining (Fig. 4). Parallel with the 100% conversion, STATs 1 and 5A were highly expressed, and the induction in expression of these two transcription factors was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by CABI treatment. The specificity of this treatment is demonstrated by examining the expression of STAT3, a protein whose expression is not substantially regulated during differentiation. As shown in Fig. 3, the expression of STAT3 was unaffected by CABI treatment and is shown as a loading control.Figure 4CABI inhibits lipid accumulation in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. Oil Red O staining was performed on 3T3-L1 cells 1 week following the induction of differentiation. Cells were induced to differentiate at 2 days postconfluence, and CABI was added at the initiation of differentiation. After 48 h, the induction medium was replaced with DMEM. The cells were treated every 24 h with a fresh bolus of CABI or Me2SO. Each plate was treated with the following concentrations of CABI: 0 μm (Me2SO control) (A), 4 μm(B), 8 μm (C), and 17 μm (D). This was a representative experiment independently performed three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The novel observations in this study include the ability of CABI to diffuse into 3T3-L1 cells and reduce the activity of cellular acetyl-CoA carboxylase and to inhibit the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells in a dose-dependent manner by blocking the induction of PPARγ expression. To account for these observations we suggest that upon entering the cell, CABI reacts with endogenous coenzyme A to form the bisubstrate analog CABI-CoA. Once formed the bisubstrate analog inhibits the cytosolic and/or mitochondrial isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that CABI had no effect on acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity in isolated cellular extracts (data not shown). However, the bisubstrate analog CABI-CoA was indeed able to inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity when added to isolated cellular extracts in vitro (data not shown). Moreover, there is precedent for enzyme inhibitors forming intracellularly by reaction of a precursor with a metabolite. Examples include finasteride, which inhibits 5α reductase (11.Bull H.G. Garcia-Calvo M. Andersson S. Baginsky W.F. Chan H.K. Ellsworth D.E. Miller R.R. Stearns R.A. Bakshi R.K. Rasmusson G.H. Tolman R.L. Myers R.W. Kozarich J.W. Harris G.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2359-2365Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar), isoniazid, which inhibits the mycobacterial enzyme InhA (12.Rozwarski D.A. Grant G.A. Barton D.H.R. Jacobs W.R. Sacchettini J.C. Science. 1998; 279: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), and a bisubstrate analog inhibitor of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (13.Khalil E.M. De Angelis J. Ishii M. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12418-12423Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The first two examples are used clinically to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy and tuberculosis, respectively. Our attempts to detect CABI-CoA in extracts from CABI-treated 3T3-L1 cells have been unsuccessful using HPLC with absorption optics. However, studies are under way to detect the bisubstrate analog CABI-CoA in cellular extracts with more sensitive methods. The observation that the expression of STAT3 was unaffected by CABI is very important, because it suggests that CABI is not acting as a nonspecific alkylating agent. Moreover, the fact that the level of acetyl-CoA carboxylase did not decrease with CABI treatment further indicates that CABI is not exerting a general toxic effect. It should be noted that the inhibition of differentiation by CABI was reversible. If the addition of CABI was not repeated every 24 h, the cells started to differentiate (data not shown). We have recently determined the inhibition constant of the bisubstrate analog, CABI-CoA, for bacterial acetyl-CoA carboxylase is 23 μm (6.Levert K.L. Waldrop G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). If the inhibition constant for the murine acetyl-CoA carboxylase in 3T3-L1 cells is similar to the bacterial enzyme, then it is tempting to speculate how an inhibitor with such a modest K i can result in such a significant biological effect. The answer begins by noting the importance of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for cell growth and the recent demonstration that a gene knock-out of cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase is embryonic lethal (4.Abu-Elheiga L. Matzuk M.M. Abo-Hashema K.A.H. Wakil S.J. Science. 2001; 291: 2613-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Our goal was not to abolish the activity of all cellular acetyl-CoA carboxylase and induce cell death. Instead, the objective was to attenuate the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and prevent lipid accumulation. To this end, a molecule with a 23 μm K i value would serve this purpose, while a molecule with a nm or lower K i value would have greater cytotoxicity. In summary, the results presented in this paper are the first demonstration of a link between a pharmalogical modulation of cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase and inhibition of adipogenesis. These studies support the gene knock-out experiments in mice, which indicate that acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a very promising target for anti-obesity agents (4.Abu-Elheiga L. Matzuk M.M. Abo-Hashema K.A.H. Wakil S.J. Science. 2001; 291: 2613-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to examine the effects of CABI on other types of cells in which acetyl-CoA carboxylase is up-regulated such as breast cancer cells (14.Thupari J.N. Pinn M.L. Kuhajda F.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We are currently searching for alterative solvents for CABI and trying to synthesize a more soluble precursor so that these compounds can be tested in rodents."
https://openalex.org/W1970255441,"Rat surfactant protein C (SP-C) is synthesized as a 194-amino acid propeptide (SP-C-(1–194)) that is directed to the distal secretory pathway and proteolytically processed as an integral membrane protein to yield its mature form. We had shown previously that trafficking of proSP-C is mediated both by a signal anchor domain contained within the mature SP-C sequence and by a targeting domain in the NH2-flanking propeptide. Based on evidence from other integral membrane proteins, we hypothesized that proSP-C targeting is effected by oligomerization of proSP-C monomers. To evaluate this in vitro, cDNA constructs encoding for either wild type proSP-C (pcDNA3/SP-C-(1–194)) or heterologous fusion proteins containing green fluorescent protein (EGFP) linked to SP-C-(1–194) (EGFP/SP-C-(1–194)), to mutant proSP-C lacking the NH2targeting domain (EGFP/SP-C-(24–194)), or to mature SP-C alone (EGFP/SP-C-(24–58)) were produced. In transfected A549 cells, fluorescence microscopy revealed that pcDNA3/SP-C-(1–194) and EGFP/SP-C-(1–194) were each expressed in CD63 (+), EEA1 (−) cytoplasmic vesicles. Expression of EGFP/SP-C-(24–194) or EGFP/SP-C-(24–58) resulted in translocation but retention in early compartments. When co-transfected with pcDNA3/SP-C-(1–194), both EGFP/SP-C-(24–194) and EGFP/SP-C-(24–58) were directed to CD63 (+) vesicles that also contained SP-C-(1–194). In contrast, trafficking of a folding mutant that forms juxtanuclear aggregates, EGFP/SP-CC122/186G, was not corrected by cotransfection with pcDNA3/SP-C-(1–194). Chemical cross-linking studies of transfected cell lysates with bismaleimidohexane produced multimeric forms of both EGFP/SP-C-(1–194) and EGFP/SP-C-(24–58). These results indicate that sorting involves oligomeric association of proSP-C monomers mediated by the mature SP-C domain. Heteromeric assembly allows wild type proSP-C to facilitate trafficking of SP-C mutants with intact transmembrane domains but lacking targeting signals. We speculate that heterotypic oligomerization of wild type with SP-C folding mutants produces a dominant negative thus contributing to the pathology of chronic lung disease associated with patients heterozygous for mutant SP-C alleles."

Here, the chromosomal distribution of (TTAGGG)n sequences in the Donax was studied by the sensitivity to Bal31 exonuclease digestion, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on metaphase chromosomes and rotating-field gel electrophoresis. To verify the occurrence of the hexamer repeat in the genomes of taxonomically related molluscs and other marine invertebrates, genomic DNA from the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the echinoderm Holothuria tubulosa was also analyzed. The kinetics of Bal31 hydrolysis of high molecular mass DNA from the three marine invertebrates revealed a marked decrease over time of the hybridization with the cloned (TTAGGG)22 sequence, concomitantly with a progressive shortening of the positively reacting DNA fragments.

The presence of (TTAGGG)n repeat tracts in marine invertebrate telomeres points to its wider distribution among eukaryotic organisms and suggests an ancestry older than originally presumed from its vertebrate distinctiveness. The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are capped with functional nucleoprotein structures known as telomeres, which are required to complete the telomerase-dependent replication of the tips of the linear DNA molecules and to preserve the stability and integrity of chromosome arms, as well as for chromosome positioning and segregation (1Zakian V.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1601-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Telomeres are structurally complex and contain several DNA components. Essentially, short double-stranded DNA repeats organized in tandem arrays at the tip regions and more complex satellite DNA sequences attached to the tandem repeats, which constitute the internal telomere-associated DNA and form the subtelomeric regions (2Biessman H. Mason J.M. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1994; 103: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The former contain G-rich strands that are enzymatically elongated by the reverse transcriptase telomerase as single-stranded tails that extend beyond the complementary C-rich strand toward the chromosomal 3′ termini (3Collins K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The structural organization and function of telomeres are fairly conserved among widely divergent organisms from protozoa to vertebrates and higher plants (4Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1994; 77: 621-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In contrast, telomeric DNA sequences appear to be variable between species and confined within large taxonomic groups, therefore telomeric repeats are considered group-specific (5Blackburn E.H. Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). In this regard, vertebrates display a repeat motif, namely (TTAGGG)n, which is conserved in all species so far examined from mammals to fish (6Garrido-Ramos M.A. de la Herrán R. Rui Zrejón C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2677-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Invertebrate telomeric repeats differ from those found in vertebrates in several respects. They exhibit a certain degree of heterogeneity in DNA sequence and repeat lengths (1Zakian V.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1601-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In addition, most insects display the pentanucleotide (T2AG2)n as the telomeric repeat element (10Sahara K. Marec F. Traut W. Chromosome Res. 1999; 7: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Moreover, synthetic oligonucleotides mimicking the pentanucleotide motif do not recognize sequences from vertebrate genomic DNA, nor do (TTAGGG)n oligomers hybridize with insect DNA (8Okazaki S. Tsuchida K. Maekawa H. Ishikawa H. Fujiwara H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1424-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To date, studies on telomeric DNA in marine and freshwater invertebrates are rather scarce and fragmentary. For instance, (T2AG2)n -containing telomeres have been reported in a freshwater crustacean (10Sahara K. Marec F. Traut W. Chromosome Res. 1999; 7: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) but found absent in a holothuroid, whose genomic DNA yielded fuzzy hybridization signals with a (TTAGGG)n probe (8Okazaki S. Tsuchida K. Maekawa H. Ishikawa H. Fujiwara H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1424-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). A similar probe has been preliminarily reported to hybridize to some extent with genomic DNA from an echinoid (15Lejnine S. Makarov V.L. Langmore J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We recently characterized a family of Hin dIII satellite DNAs in the genome of the bivalve mollusc Donax trunculus (21Plohl M. Cornudella L. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Restriction endonuclease digestions of sperm DNA from the truncated wedgeshell with Hin dIII allowed detection of a DNA fragment the size of a satellite pentamer, which resisted endonuclease cleavage even under extensive digestion conditions. Cloning of the DNA in the corresponding band yielded a set of recombinants showing positive albeit weak reactivity toward one of the characterized Hin dIII satellites. The 836-bp cloned insert appeared to be of a heterogeneous nature, since it consisted of a satellite DNA sequence tract, preceded upstream by a segment 130 bp long made up of tandemly arrayed perfect copies of the hexanucleotide (TTAGGG). The 5′-end of the cloned insert consisted of a segment without any sequence elements resembling those of the characterized satellite structures. Studies of telomeric repeats and their modes of association with repetitive DNA sequences might provide insight into the structural organization and function of telomeric and subtelomeric regions. In this paper we report the molecular cloning of the clustered tandem copies of the hexanucleotide (TTAGGG) previously detected in the sperm DNA of D. trunculus. This cloned DNA segment was used as a probe to study the chromosomal localization of (TTAGGG)n sequences in the truncated wedgeshell clam by following the time course of digestion of DNA with the exonuclease Bal31. We also examined genomic DNA from the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the sea cucumber Holothuria tubulosa. The results indicate that both molluscs as well as the echinoderm species contain clusters of the (TTAGGG) repeat and that the tandem arrays are preferentially located at their chromosome ends. In addition, FISH 1The abbreviations used are: FISHfluorescence in situ hybridizationRFGErotating-field gel electrophoresisFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate on metaphase chromosomes of both molluscs together with RFGE analyses supported the localization suggested by the exonuclease experiments.

Specimens of live H. tubulosa were moved to the laboratory and kept in cold seawater until use. Sperm fluid was obtained as described previously (22Drabent B. Kim J.S. Albig W. Prats E. Cornudella L. Doenecke D. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, mollusc shells were carefully opened with a scalpel, and the gills were removed to expose gonadal tissue. Sperm fluid was collected through a small incision with the aid of a Pasteur pipette. Male gonads from the echinoderm species were excised immediately before use, squeezed, and the resulting sperm fluid filtered through flannelette as detailed elsewhere (21Plohl M. Cornudella L. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). High molecular mass DNA was isolated and purified from fresh sperm suspensions by standard phenol extraction with some modifications (23Sainz J. Cornudella L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To test for the chromosomal positioning of (TTAGGG) repeat tracts, purified sperm DNA samples were subjected to Bal31 exonucleolytic trimming with time. High molecular mass DNA (20 μg) in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 600 mm NaCl, 12.5 mmCaCl2, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2EDTA was supplemented with λ-DNA Hin dIII fragments (0.5 μg) to monitor the extent of the digestion and treated with Bal31 nuclease (2 units) at 30 °C in a final volume of 150 μl. Aliquots of 3.3 μg of DNA (one-sixth of the bulk reaction) were taken at various times: time 0 (prior to enzyme addition), 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 min, respectively. Reactions were halted by addition of Na2EDTA to 50 mm, inactivated at 75 °C for 10 min, and chilled on ice. Digested DNAs were then recovered by ethanol precipitation and finally dissolved in distilled water. A sixth part of the DNA digests (0.55 μg) was used to monitor λ-Hin dIII fragment trimming, whereas the remainder (2.75 μg) was further digested with AluI. All enzymatic digests were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels and the resolved DNA fragments subsequently transferred to positively charged nylon membranes by alkaline blotting in 0.4 n NaOH after partial depurination (24Reed K.C. Mann D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7207-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). DNA probes were labeled with fluorescein-12-dUTP by random priming with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I using the Ready-To-Go labeling beads (AmershamBiosciences). Hybridizations were carried out overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide containing 0.25 mNa2HPO4 (pH 7.2), 7% SDS, 1 mmEDTA, and 50 μg/ml tRNA, followed by stringent washes in 0.1 × SSC (saline-sodium citrate), 1% SDS at 65 °C, except for the cloned histone H4 probe from H. tubulosa, which was hybridized at 35 °C, and the membrane washed at 57 °C. Stringency washes were followed by blocking with 0.2% casein, 0.5% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline and the filters finally reacted with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody (Tropix). Hybridization signals were visualized by chemiluminescence using the dioxetane CDP-Star (disodium 2-chloro-5-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro) tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)-1-phenyl phosphate) (Roche Diagnostics) and recorded on x-ray film. The relative genomic abundance of the (TTAGGG) hexamer sequence was determined by dot-hybridization of graded amounts of both D. trunculus sperm DNA and the recombinant plasmid containing the 148-bp fragment encompassing the (TTAGGG)22 tandem repeat. DNA samples were spot-blotted onto nylon and the membrane subsequently probed with the repetitive insert released from the recombinant clone and 32P-labeled by random priming (25Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). After exposure to film the intensities of the radioactive signals were quantified using a computer-assisted laser densitometer loaded with the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). Mean values were derived from two independent experiments. The genomic organization of (TTAGGG) tandem arrays was examined by RFGE. Aliquots of purified sperm suspensions from D. trunculus were embedded in 0.5% agarose plugs at a DNA concentration of 0.5 μg/μl as previously described (22Drabent B. Kim J.S. Albig W. Prats E. Cornudella L. Doenecke D. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Agarose plugs containing high molecular mass DNA larger than 400 kb were incubated with selected restriction endonucleases and the resulting large genomic fragments resolved on 1.2% agarose gels in 0.5 × TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA) at 11 °C. Electrophoresis was run at 100 V for 1 h, followed by successive pulses of 10 s for 15 h and 20 s for 20 h at 200 V with 120° reorientation angles. Gels were then visualized by ethidium bromide staining and the DNA fragments transferred to a nylon membrane. Subsequent hybridizations to the cloned (TTAGGG)22 probe were carried out as described above. Truncated wedgeshell and mussel specimens were continuously fed with Isochrisis galbana microalgae for 10 days in the laboratory. Before use, following treatment with 0.005% colchicine for 6–8 h, gills were dissected and metaphase spreads prepared as described previously (26González-Tizón A. Martı́nez-Lage A. Rego I. Ausio J. Méndez J. Genome. 2000; 43: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). FISH was carried out with the (TTAGGG)22 cloned probe labeled with digoxigenin by a standard PCR procedure and denatured at 75 °C for 15 min. The hybridization was performed in a PTC-100 microscope slide thermal cycler (MJ Research), with a solution of 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate in 2 × SSC, containing sonicated salmon sperm DNA (0.3 mg/ml) and the denatured digoxigenin-labeled hexamer repeat (3.3 μg/ml). Post-hybridization washes were performed in 2 × SSC at 42 °C and then sequentially with 20% formamide in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1 × SSC, and 2 × SSC for 10 min each. For detection, slides were washed in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 buffer and blocked in the same buffer containing 0.5% casein, but lacking detergent, at 37 °C for 30 min. The slides were then incubated with anti-digoxigenin mouse serum at a dilution of 1:200 in blocking buffer at 37 °C for 30 min, rinsed in the same buffer, and subsequently subjected to two consecutive rounds of incubation in the same conditions, first with rabbit anti-mouse serum conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at a dilution of 1:1000, and finally with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum at the same dilution, to amplify the fluorescence signals. The slides were then washed once in blocking buffer, dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, and air dried. Metaphase preparations were counterstained with an antifade solution containing propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), examined under a microphot AFX Nikon fluorescence microscope, and photographed on Kodachrome color slide film (400 ASA). During characterization of a family of four Hin dIII satellite DNAs in the truncated wedgeshell, a DNA fragment of similar length to a satellite pentamer was released upon digestion of sperm DNA. This fragment resisted endonuclease fragmentation even under extensive digestion conditions. It hybridized positively in Southern blots of electrophoretically resolved restriction fragments from Hin dIII digests probed with the monomer clone DTHS1 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number X94534) of the characterized type-1 Hin dIII Donax satellite. The DNA in the corresponding band was recovered, cloned, and sequenced (GenBankTM/EBI accession number X94546) (21Plohl M. Cornudella L. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The cloned insert was 836 bp long and ended in a 66-bp tract that corresponded to the 3′-terminal half of the DTHS1 monomer unit. The latter sequence was preceded upstream by a 130-bp segment comprising 22 tandemly arrayed copies of the hexanucleotide C3TA2, which appeared to be the reversed complement of the vertebrate-type (TTAGGG) telomeric repeat, as well as that of the main subrepeat element found in the DTHS1 satellite DNA. The hexamer repeats were all perfect copies except for the 3′-penultimate repeat in which one C was lacking. A second internal deletion of a single T was observed 5′ contiguous to position 670 of the insert sequence. The clustered repeats were flanked on both sides by endonuclease recognition sequences for MseI and DdeI, with cleavage sites 3′ to positions 622 and 770, respectively (Fig. 1). These two restriction enzyme sites allowed to release from the original clone a DNA fragment encompassing the entire set of highly conserved tandem repeats. The excised 148-bp DNA fragment was blunt-ended and subcloned into the EcoRV site of the pBluescript +SK vector. In turn, the cloned insert was released with polylinker enzymes contiguous to the cloning site and used as a probe throughout the experimental work presented here. The genomic localization of (TTAGGG)n sequences was examined by following the time course of Bal31 degradation of sperm DNA from the wedgeshell clam. High molecular mass genomic DNA extracted from fresh sperm suspensions was subjected to Bal31 digestion with time. Phage λ-DNA Hin dIII fragments were added to the DNA samples to monitor the extent of exonucleolytic trimming. DNA aliquots were taken at intervals, and a fraction of each aliquot was subsequently digested to completion with AluI. DNA samples, prior and after AluI digestion, were then electrophoresed in parallel on a 0.8% agarose gel (Fig. 2 A) and Southern blotted to a nylon membrane. The half of the membrane containing the undigested Bal31-trimmed DNA was cut out and hybridized with fluorescein-labeled λ-DNA Hin dIII fragments (Fig. 2 B). It can be clearly observed the progressive shortening of the λ-Hin dIII fragment lengths. All fragment sizes gradually decreased with the course of Bal31 digestion as a consequence of the continuous exonuclease trimming of the λ-DNA fragment termini. Obviously, this pattern was more apparent in the smaller fragments, which tended to fade away at late time intervals. The second half of the nylon membrane, containing the Bal31-AluI-digested DNA fragments, was initially hybridized to the insert of the recombinant pUC19 clone carrying a 1.5-kb Hin cII fragment containing the entire sequence of the H. tubulosa histone H4 gene (GenBankTM/EBI accession number Z46226) (27Drabent B. Louroutziatis A. Prats E. Cornudella L. Doenecke D. DNA Sequence. 1995; 6: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), labeled with fluorescein (Fig. 2 C). As expected from the internal location of this histone gene in the genome, the DNA bands reacting with the histone H4 probe remained unaltered during the time course of Bal31 digestion except for a slight fall in signal intensity at longer times. The results of the hybridizations with the λ-Hin dIII DNA and histone H4 probes indicate the integrity of the extracted genomic DNA, ruling out any nicking or inner degradation of the DNA, while corroborating the exonucleolytic specificity of Bal31. Subsequently, the H4 probe was stripped off the membrane, which was rehybridized to the fluorescein-labeled (TTAGGG)22 cloned sequence (Fig. 2 D). In contrast to the electrophoretic patterns of the bulk DNA fragments shown in Fig. 2 A, where the effects of the digestions with Bal31 alone or in pairwise combination with AluI were hardly detected by the ethidium bromide staining, the double digestion of sperm DNA generated an uneven and dauby pattern of hybridization with the repeat probe. AluI digestion of genomic DNA at time 0 of the serial digestions with Bal31 produced a broad, intense hybridizing band of low mobility. A fast-moving band, comparable with the former but broader and less intense, was also seen near the migration front (lane 0′ in Fig. 2 D). Integration of the areas under the signal peaks in densitometer tracings of the autoradiogram yielded a DNA distribution in both peaks amounting, respectively, to approximately 45 and 35% of the total DNA hybridizing to the probe in the lane. Likewise, the estimated size of the DNA fragments under the peaks, as deduced from the scans, ranged from 10,000 to 20,000 bp and 500 to 1000 bp, respectively (data not shown). The signal intensity of the hybridizing DNA bands generated by AluI digestion gradually decreased during the Bal31 exonucleolytic trimming, shifting toward lower length distributions with a concomitant reduction of the hybridization signals at the longest times. However, the sensitivity of the upper DNA signal to Bal31 was slightly higher than that of the lower signal. The intensity of the former decreased drastically within 30 min of digestion, thereafter fading faster than the lower signal, traces of which still persisted at longer digestion intervals. The high level of hybridization of genomic DNA to the cloned (TTAGGG)22 sequence reveals the presence of arrays of this vertebrate-type hexameric repeat within Donax DNA. Furthermore, the preferential susceptibility of the DNA sequences positively reacting with the repeat probe to Bal31 exonucleolytic trimming favors a terminal positioning of the bulk of the repeat arrays and therefore allows to qualify them as true telomeric DNA located at the chromosome ends in this mollusc. To verify the occurrence of similar hexameric sequences in the genomes of taxonomically related molluscs and other marine invertebrates, sperm DNA samples from the blue mussel M. galloprovincialis and the echinoderm H. tubulosa were subjected to Bal31 digestion in the above conditions (Fig. 3). As expected, the histone H4 repeat taken as internal gene marker in the Donax genomic DNA showed comparable behavior in both the mussel and the sea cucumber sperm DNAs when subjected to serial digestions with Bal31 and to completion with AluI. The corresponding DNA restriction fragments reacting positively with the histone H4 probe remained insensitive to exonucleolytic trimming. However, the hybridization patterns of the histone H4 gene were not strictly identical in the three invertebrate species examined. The minor dissimilarities observed can be attributed to varying susceptibilities of the respective DNAs to AluI together with differing structural arrangements of histone H4 genes in these organisms (27Drabent B. Louroutziatis A. Prats E. Cornudella L. Doenecke D. DNA Sequence. 1995; 6: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Both sperm DNAs reacted similarly to DonaxDNA (see Fig. 2 D), yielding broad patterns upon digestion with AluI and hybridization to the labeled (TTAGGG)22 probe. The size distribution of both blurred patterns gradually decreased with the digestion, displaying a clear tendency to fade with time. This indicates a marked sensitivity of the hybridizing DNA to exonuclease trimming. These data support tracing the Bal31-sensitive DNA to chromosomal termini in both the mussel and sea cucumber DNAs and unambiguously confirm the presence of a substantial proportion of (TTAGGG) repeats at the telomeres of these marine invertebrate DNAs. No positively hybridizing DNA bands resistant to Bal31 were seen in the DNAs analyzed except those of the mussel. The hybridization pattern of Mytilus DNA digested with AluI displayed a few discrete bands, albeit faint, in the range 500–1000 bp that were unaffected by the Bal31 digestion. The insensitivity to trimming of these DNA bands containing (TTAGGG) sequences suggests an internal positioning within genomic DNA, namely, at interstitial chromosome regions (2Biessman H. Mason J.M. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1994; 103: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The presence of these internal hexameric sequences implies that they are represented within genomic DNA in the mussel, constituting discrete DNA elements that produce well defined bands upon digestion. The intensity of the hybridizing bands suggests the repetitiveness of these internal sequences. Concurrently, the failure to detect similar DNA bands in the hybridization patterns from D. trunculus and H. tubulosa does not preclude their existence provided that they are either organized in DNA tracts variable in length and/or so poorly represented in the genomes that they remain undetectable. To derive the content of (TTAGGG) repeated sequences at the ends of Donax chromosomes, the relative genomic abundance of the hexameric DNA sequence was determined from dot-blots of increasing amounts of the recombinant clone carrying the (TTAGGG)22 insert, together with graded amounts of total sperm DNA from the mollusc. Subsequently, the nylon membrane was hybridized to a 32P-labeled (TTAGGG)22 insert released from the same clone and the hybridization signals quantified using a laser densitometer (Fig. 4). The genomic abundance computed for the hexameric tandem repeat comprised 0.05% of the total sperm DNA. Since the size of the haploid DNA complement (C-value) of the wedgeshell clam has been estimated as 1.4 × 109 bp (28Hinegardner R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1974; 47A: 447-460Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the former value roughly amounts to 4700 copies of the (TTAGGG)22 sequence per haploid genome, equivalent to approximately 100,000 hexamer copies. The genomic length of the putative telomeric arrays of (TTAGGG) repeats can be approximated assuming their preferential localization at the ends of the mollusc chromosomes and using the repeat copy number found, together with the chromosome number of the haploid cells from Donax (n = 19) (29Cornet M. Soulard C. Genetica. 1990; 82: 93-97Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Since the frequency found for the (TTAGGG) repeat amounts to 100,000 copies and taking into account the haploid chromosomal complement, the computation yields a value of 5200 repeats per chromosome or 2600 per chromosomal terminus, equivalent to a repeat tract length of 15.6 kb of DNA. This value is consistent with the size range of the upper DNA band generated by AluI at zero time of the Bal31 digestion (lane 0′ in Fig. 2 D), as well as with those from the four-cutter endonuclease digestions shown in Fig. 6, and falls within the range of lengths reported for telomeric repeats in mammalian cells (3Collins K.

Their individual involvement in functions ascribed to Hck, phagocytosis, cell migration, and lysosome mobilization, is still unclarified. To investigate the specific role of p59Hck, a constitutively active variant in fusion with green fluorescent protein (p59Hckca) was expressed in HeLa cells. p59Hckca was found at focal adhesion sites and triggered reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, leading to plasma membrane protrusions where it co-localized with F-actin. Similarly, microinjection of p59Hckca cDNA in J774.A1 macrophages induced membrane protrusions.

Src PTKs are key elements of diverse signaling cascades, which act via at least two different ways: a tyrosine kinase activity and/or an adaptor function (for a review, see Ref. 2Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). These two roles are achieved by three highly conserved domains shared by all members of the Src family. The Src homology domain 1 (SH1) lying at the C terminus of the protein supports the catalytic activity of the enzyme, and the SH2 and SH3 domains allow interactions with cellular proteins through recognition of phosphotyrosine and proline-rich motif, respectively (3Yu H. Rosen M.K. Shin T.B. Seidel-Dugan C. Brugge J.S. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1992; 258: 1665-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 4Moran M.F. Koch C.A. Anderson D. Ellis C. England L.

Src PTKs are regulated by the phosphorylation state of a conserved carboxyl-terminal tyrosine. When phosphorylated, this tyrosine is recognized by the SH2 domain, leading to intramolecular interactions that stabilize the kinase under its inactive form. Its dephosphorylation disrupts these intramolecular interactions and subsequently unmasks the SH3, SH2, and catalytic domains. Therefore, this protein “opening” activates both the adaptor and the kinase functions of Src PTKs (5Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J.

Ralph S. Stanley E. Boulet I. Ramsay R. Dunn A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4363-4370Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Like other members of the Src family, both Hck isoforms have a unique amino-terminal domain comprising about 80 amino acids with acylation motifs (7Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). p61Hck has 21 additional N-terminal amino acids containing the Met1-Gly2-X 3-X 4-X 5-Ser6/Thr6N-terminal sequence that supports covalent myristoylation of glycine 2, whereas the Met1-Gly2-Cys3-X 4-X 5-Ser6/Thr6N terminus of p59Hck guides permanent myristoylation of glycine 2 and reversible palmitoylation of cysteine 3 (8Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These different acylations govern association of both isoforms with distinct cellular membranes; while the double acylated form of p59Hck is anchored at the plasma membrane, the monoacylated forms (p61Hck and the nonpalmitoylated form of p59Hck) are associated with lysosomal membranes, both isoforms being present at the Golgi apparatus (9Carreno S.

These distinct subcellular localizations are probably a key element of the differential functions of Hck isoforms by offering them access to different substrates.

However, no attempt has been made to identify the respective functions of each isoform. In this work, we focused on p59Hck and investigated the function devoted to this plasma membrane-associated isoform. Since we have previously shown that ectopic expression of Hck isoforms in HeLa cells leads to the same subcellular distribution as the endogenous kinase in human neutrophils and monocytes-macrophages (9Carreno S. Gouze M.E. Schaak S. Emorine L.J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36223-36229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we first decided to study p59Hck function in these human epithelial cells. We took advantage of the nonexpression of Hck in these cells to examine whether expression of this phagocyte-specific kinase would trigger a phagocyte-specific phenotype. Ectopic expression of a constitutively active form of p59Hck in fusion with GFP in these cells led to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which triggered the formation of plasma membrane protrusions. When the Hck-GFP construct was microinjected in J774.A1 macrophages, a similar phenotype was observed. Using targeted mutagenesis and deletion constructs, we showed that these cytoskeletal changes were strictly dependent on the association of p59Hck with the plasma membrane and involved both its tyrosine kinase activity and its SH2 adaptor domain. Furthermore, we showed that a dominant negative form of p59Hck co-transfected in HeLa cells with the FcγRIIa was able to inhibit phagocytosis mediated by this receptor. Since Cdc42 and Rac, two small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho subfamily that control the actin cytoskeleton, have been involved in FcγR-mediated phagocytosis (15Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 16Massol P. Montcourrier P. Guillemot J.C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6219-6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we investigated their role in the p59Hck-mediated membrane protrusion. Using dominant negative Cdc42 or Rac or the Cdc42/Rac-interacting domain of p21 (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase (PAK), we showed that p59Hck acted upstream of the Cdc42/Rac pathway to promote these cytoskeletal changes both in HeLa cells and in macrophages. We thus propose that p59Hck is part of a signaling pathway between plasma membrane receptors and Cdc42/Rac that promotes actin cytoskeleton rearrangements necessary for phagocytosis or cell migration. The wild-type Hck cDNA was a gift from N. Quintrell (1Quintrell N. Lebo R. Varmus H. Bishop J.M. Pettenati M.J., Le Beau M.M. Diaz M.O. Rowley J.D. Mol. Cell.

The PCR products were ligated into the NheI site of pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), preserving the 28-amino acid polylinker of the vector between p59Hckca and GFP. The C3S point mutation was introduced into the p59Hckca-GFP vector by inverse PCR mutating the cysteine (TGC) into serine (AGC) and introducing a NcoI site. The p59Hckdn-GFP was obtained by inverse PCR on the p59Hckca-GFP vector mutating the lysine 381 (AAG) responsible of ATP binding into glutamic acid (GAG) and introducing an XcmI site. p61Hckca and p61Hckdn fused with GFP were obtained by the same strategy using the p61Hck-GFP vector as template (9Carreno S.

Conformity of each mutations was verified by sequencing (Genome Express, Grenoble, France). In addition, all constructs were tested for expression by Western blotting (see below). For phagocytic assay we used the plasmid pKC3 encoding the human FcγRIIa provided by C. Sautes-Fridman (17Cassard L. Dragon-Durey M.A. Ralli A. Tartour E. Salamero J. Fridman W.H. Sautes-Fridman C.

Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well on glass coverslips) for immunofluorescence experiments or in 9-cm Petri dishes (106 cells) for immunoblotting experiments. The following day, phosphate precipitate was added to the cells (1 μg of DNA per 40 μl of DNA/calcium per well containing 360 μl of fresh complete medium). For double transfection experiments, DNA/calcium phosphate precipitates were made with 500 ng of each cDNA. Cells were washed free of DNA/calcium phosphate precipitates after 16–18 h and incubated in fresh medium for an additional period of 60 h before analyses. The murine macrophage cell line J774.A1 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml). Transfected cells grown on glass coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and unreacted aldehyde groups were neutralized in 50 mm NH4Cl for 1 min. After washing and permeabilization (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, 5 min), cells were blocked for 10 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA). Coverslips were then overlaid as indicated with 20 μl of one of the following primary antibodies diluted into PBS-BSA: monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody (1:50; Sigma), monoclonal anti-FcγRIIa IV.3 antibody (300 ng/ml; kindly provided by C. Sautes-Fridman (20Vely F. Gruel N. Moncuit J. Cochet O. Rouard H. Dare S. Galon J. Sautes C. Fridman W.H. Teillaud J.L.

After a 30-min incubation period, the coverslips were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a 1:100 dilution of affinity-purified TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) directed against mouse IgG. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS. Labeling of F-actin was performed on cells fixed as described above, after permeabilization (0.3% Triton X-100, 5 min), and coverslips were overlaid with 20 μl of permeabilization buffer supplemented with 0.3 units of rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). In some experiments, cells were incubated for 24 h with 20 μg/ml recombinant C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum kindly provided by P. Boquet and prepared as previously described (21Doussau F.

All coverslips were mounted in Mowiol and viewed using a Leica DM-RB fluorescence microscope or a Leica TCS-SP2 confocal scanning microscope. Epifluorescence images were captured, and negatives were digitalized with a Nikon LS2000. All images were prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop software. J774 macrophages were used for microinjection as previously described (15Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages were seeded on glass coverslips at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml. Immediately prior to injection, cells were transferred to 10 mm Hepes-buffered, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. cDNA constructs prepared for microinjection by standard CsCl gradient methods were injected (0.1 mg/ml) into the nucleus of 50–100 cells in a temperature (37 °C)- and CO2 (10%)-controlled chamber using phase-contrast microscopy. Cells were returned to the incubator for ∼2.5 h for optimal expression. Cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature prior to permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min and quenching in NH4Cl/PBS (2.7 mg/ml) for 10 min. For immunostaining, cells were blocked with 0.5% BSA for 30 min and then incubated with antibodies diluted in PBS for 30 min. Where appropriate, all antibody mixes contained excess human IgG (Sigma) to prevent nonspecific binding to the Fc receptors. Myc-tagged constructs were visualized using mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10) followed by Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. F-actin was stained using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). Coverslips were mounted in mowiol mountant (Calbiochem) containing p-phenylenediamine as an antibleaching agent. Cells were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using a Zeiss 63 × 1.4 oil immersion objective. Fluorescence images were captured using a Hamamatsu C5985–10 video camera and Openlab software and processed using Adobe Photoshop. 60 h after transfection, HeLa cells (3 × 106 cells) were washed in PBS, lysed in 1 ml of Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Neutrophils from healthy donors were isolated (22Maridonneau-Parini I. Tringale S.M. Tauber A.I. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2925-2929PubMed Google Scholar) by Dextran T500 sedimentation (AmershamBiosciences) and Ficoll centrifugation (Eurobio) and were resuspended in boiling Laemmli buffer. Proteins were electrophoresed through 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, which was blocked in Tris-buffered saline buffer containing 5% nonfat milk, and then incubated with anti-Hck antibodies (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The primary antibody was revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:10,000; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) followed by ECL (AmershamBiosciences). Zymosan particles (Sigma) were swollen in PBS for 30 min. They were then sedimented by centrifugation, washed, and incubated in 0.2m Na2CO3/NaHCO3, pH 9.2, with 250 μg/ml rhodamine B isothiocyanate (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by 50 mmNH4Cl. Labeled zymosan was washed several times in PBS, resuspended, and opsonized in pooled human sera for 30 min at 37 °C. Opsonized and rhodamine-labeled zymosan was washed twice and resuspended in PBS. HeLa cells were used 60 h after transfection. Cells were starved in serum for 3 h, and then opsonized zymosan was added at a concentration of 100 particles/cell and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were then extensively washed to remove adherent zymosan, fixed in paraformaldehyde. External particles was labeled using fluorescein-conjugated anti-human IgG (1:100; Diagnostics Pasteur, Paris, France) and then appeared as doubly green and red fluorescence. FcγRIIa was detected using a monoclonal anti-FcγRIIa antibody revealed by TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies as described above. Cells positive for both GFP fluorescence and FcγRIIa labeling were then counted by fluorescence microscopy for the presence of at least one particle inside the cell. To study the cellular effects triggered by p59Hck, we made use of a constitutive active form of p59Hck (p59Hckca), obtained by point-mutating p59Hck cDNA to replace the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine (responsible for the intramolecular regulation) by a phenylalanine (23Chiaradonna F. Fontana L. Iavarone C. Carriero M.V. Scholz G. Barone M.V. Stoppelli M.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3013-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Subcellular localization and estimation of the expression level of p59Hck were allowed by a C-terminal fusion with GFP, which has been previously shown not to interfere with the kinase activity of Hck or with its localization (9Carreno S. Gouze M.E. Schaak S. Emorine L.J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36223-36229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Direct confocal fluorescence analysis of HeLa cells transiently expressing p59Hck or p59Hckca showed the association of both proteins with the plasma membrane (Fig. 1) (9Carreno S. Gouze M.E. Schaak S. Emorine L.J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36223-36229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The shape of cells expressing p59Hckca was dramatically modified by the formation of plasma membrane protrusions (Fig. 1). This phenotype was observed in 57.2 ± 5.3% of the cells expressing p59Hckca (488 total cells counted out of three representative experiments). It is notable that this phenotype was obtained even at low levels of p59Hckca expression as assessed by the heterogeneous intensity of fluorescence in cells forming protrusions (see the cell shown by an arrow in Fig. 1, C and D). Because membrane extensions are associated with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, the effects of activated p59Hck on F-actin organization were examined by a rhodamine-phalloidin labeling. Cells expressing p59Hck showed a similar pattern of F-actin as nontransfected cells, whereas cells expressing p59Hckca displayed a clear reorganization of their actin filaments with disappearance of stress fibers and actin polymerization at the periphery in GFP-enriched membrane protrusions corresponding to sites of p59Hckca localization (Fig. 2, D–I). It can also be noted that, as previously described, the Golgi apparatus was stained by p59Hck (Figs. 1 A and 2 A) (9Carreno S. Gouze M.E. Schaak S. Emorine L.J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36223-36229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). p59Hckca was also associated with the Golgi, which was dispersed as vesicles into the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, J–L). A similar Golgi phentotype is observed in cells treated with microtubule depolymerizing agents (24Thyberg J. Moskalewski S. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, the microtubule network was not affected in cells expressing the constitutively active p59Hckca (data not shown). The mechanisms involved in disruption of the Golgi apparatus by the action of p59Hckcaare presently under study in the laboratory. Because Hck is a phagocyte-specific Src-like kinase, we also studied the effect of its overexpression in the murine macrophage cell line, J774.A1. When J774 cells are grown on glass coverslips, their morphology is generally reminiscent of that of motile cells (i.e. they adopt an elongated, polarized shape that shows an F-actin-rich leading edge). cDNA constructs were microinjected in the nucleus of cells. As shown in Fig. 3, microinjection per se did not affect cell morphology. In some cases, GFP-expressing cells displayed numerous, long filopodia, contrasting with the few short filopodia associated with control cells (12.8 ± 1.8% of 226 cells counted of three experiments). By contrast, overexpression of GFP-tagged p59Hck (data not shown) or p59Hckca induced the formation of membrane protrusions and localized actin-rich ruffles in which Hck-GFP accumulated (Fig. 3) in 53.1 ± 1.9% (252 cells counted of three experiments) or 57.9 ± 3.7% (90 cells counted of three experiments) of the cells, respectively. Since the association of p59Hck with the plasma membrane is dependent on palmitoylation (9Carreno S. Gouze M.E. Schaak S. Emorine L.J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36223-36229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we constructed a palmitoylation mutant of p59Hckca to determine whether formation of membrane protrusions is due to its presence at the plasma membrane. The palmitoylated cysteine residue at position 3 of p59Hckca was substituted by a serine (p59C3SHckca). This mutant was not associated with the plasma membrane but was redistributed into cytoplasmic vesicles previously characterized as lysosomes (9Carreno S. Gouze M.E. Schaak S. Emorine L.J. Maridonneau-Parini I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36223-36229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whereas about 60% of the cells expressing p59Hckca had membrane protrusions, none of the cells expressing p59C3SHckcapresented these structures (Fig. 4,A–C). Src kinases comprise a tyrosine kinase activity and SH2 and SH3 adaptor functions. To distinguish which of these two properties was involved in the formation of plasma membrane protrusions, the lysine residue responsible for ATP binding was substituted by a glutamic acid in p59Hckca. This mutation has previously been shown to lead to a kinase-less, adaptor-plus form of Src kinases with dominant negative properties for kinase activity (p59Hckdn) (25Fan G. Shumay E. Malbon C.C. Wang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13240-13247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,26Lionberger J.M. Wilson M.B. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18581-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). HeLa cells expressing p59Hckdn never showed formation of membrane protrusions or disorganization of stress fibers (Fig. 4,D–F). We noticed that p59C3SHckcaor p59Hckdn mutants were redistributed to focal adhesion structures, where they colocalized with vinculin, a usual marker of these sites (27Geiger B. Volk T. Volberg T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1523-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, G–L). Similarly, p59Hckca co-localized with vinculin, mostly at the edge of membrane extensions (Fig. 4, M–O). Therefore, neither kinase activity nor plasma membrane attachment is required for association to focal adhesions. The presence of p59Hckca at focal adhesion sites was not isoform-specific, since we observed that p61Hckca, the lysosome-associated isoform, was also targeted to focal adhesions as determined by its colocalization with vinculin (Fig. 5). p61Hckdnwas also found in focal adhesion plaques, indicating that the adaptor function of the protein is sufficient for this targeting. The SH2 domain is responsible for phosphotyrosine recognition and the SH3 domain for binding to proline-rich domains. To determine whether adaptor domains were implicated in formation of membrane protrusions, several deletions were made in p59Hckca cDNA (Fig. 6 A). The deletion mutants expressed in HeLa cells migrated in SDS gels at the expected molecular weights (p59(ΔSH2-SH3)Hckca, p59(ΔSH2)Hckca, and p59(ΔSH3)Hckca) (Fig. 6 B). Each of these mutants remained localized at the plasma membrane, but those deleted for both SH2 and SH3 domains failed to promote membrane protrusions (Fig. 6 C) and modifications of the actin cytoskeleton (data not shown). Similarly, the p59(ΔSH2)Hckca was unable to promote membrane protrusions, whereas cells expressing p59(ΔSH3)Hckcashowed these cytoskeletal modifications at a similar rate as cells transfected by p59Hckca (Fig. 6 C), indicating that interaction of the kinase with its partners involved in formation of membrane protrusions requires the SH2 but not the SH3 domain. Pseudopodia are membrane structures involved in phagocytosis of IgG-coated particles by FcγRs (28Kaplan G. Scand. J. Immunol. 1977; 6: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Src PTKs are activated upon FcγR aggregation (29Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar), and Hck has been described to be physically associated with the FcγRIIa receptor (13Ghazizadeh S. Bolen J.B. Fleit H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since we have shown above that constitutive activation of p59Hck is sufficient to trigger actin rearrangements leading to formation of membrane protrusions, this led us to hypothesize that p59Hck might link the Fcγ receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. Expression of the FcγRIIa receptor confers phagocytic capacities to non-phagocytic cells in contact with IgG-coated particles (30Downey G.P. Botelho R.J. Butler J.R. Moltyaner Y. Chien P. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28436-28444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because of the well known functional redundancy of Src PTKs, it is likely that ubiquitous members of the Src PTK family replace the phagocyte-specific kinases that are lacking in these cells. Indeed, in macrophages from Hck, Lyn, and Fgr triple knockout mice, phagocytosis of IgG-coated particles is still dri"
https://openalex.org/W2021691701,"DNA topoisomerase I is a nucleolar protein, which relocates to the nucleoplasm in response to drugs stabilizing topoisomerase I·DNA intermediates (e.g. camptothecin). Here we demonstrate that this phenomenon is solely caused by the drug’s impact on the interplay between mobility and localization of topoisomerase I in a living cell nucleus. We show by photobleaching of cells expressing biofluorescent topoisomerase I-chimera that the enzyme moves continuously between nucleoli and nucleoplasm. Complex kinetics of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates that two enzyme fractions with different mobility coexist in nucleoli and nucleoplasm. However, the whole complement of topoisomerase I is in continuous flux between these compartments and nucleolar accumulation can plausibly explained by the enzyme’s 2-fold lesser overall mobility in nucleoli versus nucleoplasm. Upon addition of camptothecin, topoisomerase I relocates within 30 s from the nucleoli to radial nucleoplasmic structures. At these sites, the enzyme becomes retarded in a dose-dependent manner. Inside nucleoli the mobility of topoisomerase I is much less affected by camptothecin. Thus, the enzyme’s distribution equilibrium is shifted toward the nucleoplasm, which causes nucleolar delocalization. In general, topoisomerase I is an entirely mobile nuclear component, unlikely to require specific signaling for movements between nuclear compartments.

In general, topoisomerase I is an entirely mobile nuclear component, unlikely to require specific signaling for movements between nuclear compartments. green fluorescent protein fluorescence loss in photobleaching fluorescence recovery after photobleaching DNA topoisomerase I changes the pitch of DNA helices by cutting one DNA strand and allowing passage of the complementary strand through the transient nick (1Champoux J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). One important role for this mechanism is the release of torsional stress created by DNA transcription. Thus, topoisomerase I activity is in principle required in the nucleoplasm for mRNA synthesis (2Zhang H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and in the nucleolus for rRNA synthesis (3Muller M.T. Pfund W.P. Mehta V.B. Trask D.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, the latter is considered the major working place of the enzyme, which has been recognized as a predominantly nucleolar protein (3Muller M.T. Pfund W.P. Mehta V.B. Trask D.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4Mo Y.Y. Wang P. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Camptothecin and other agents stabilizing covalent topoisomerase I·DNA intermediates cause relocation of topoisomerase I from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm (5Danks M.K. Garrett K.E. Marion R.C. Whipple D.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1664-1673PubMed Google Scholar). This was also observed with inhibitors of RNA synthesis prompting the conclusion that the phenomenon might be related to reduced activity of rRNA biosynthesis in the nucleolus (6Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.C. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1674-1681PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been proposed that camptothecin-induced conjugation of topoisomerase I with small ubiquitin-like modifiers might serve as a signal triggering translocation of topoisomerase I from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm (7Yu Y.Y. Mo Y. Shen Z. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2958-2964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Until now the dynamic properties of topoisomerase I in the nucleus or between nuclear compartments have not been assessed directly. Thus, it is not clear whether the enzyme is mobile or not, whether it resides in the nucleolus in a static manner and moves into the nucleoplasm in response to specific signals (as suggested in ref. 7Yu Y.Y.

Consequently, it is also unclear as to what is the molecular event that leads to nucleolar delocalization of topoisomerase I upon exposure to camptothecins. We addressed these questions by determining the mobility of topoisomerase I in substructures of the living cell nucleus using high resolution confocal fluorescent microscopy and photobleaching techniques.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGFP1-topoisomerase I was stably expressed in the human embryonal kidney cell line 293 (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany) using a bicistronic expression vector (8Mielke C. Tummler M. Schubeler D. von Hoegen I. Hauser H. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 254: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The first cistron was hybrid genes of GFP and either human topoisomerase I or the active site mutant topoisomerase IPhe-723. The second cistron contained the selection marker puromycin-N-acetyl transferase. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with Glutamax-I (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Stably transfected cell lines were selected and maintained with 0.35 μg ml−1 puromycin. Immunoblotting and immunhistochemistry followed published protocols (9Meyer K.N. Kjeldsen E. Straub T. Knudsen B.K. Kikuchi A. Hickson I.D. Kreipe H. Boege F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Epifluorescent images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted microscope equipped with a heated live-cell chamber system (Bioptechs Inc., Butler, PA) for inspection of living cell specimen. For confocal imaging, FRAP, and FLIP, we used a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a CO2-controlled on-stage heating chamber and a heated 63×/1.4 NA oil-immersion objective. Culturing of cells at 37 °C under the microscope was crucial for obtaining consistent data of localization and mobility of topoisomerase I, whereas erratic results were obtained when native cell specimen were analyzed at ambient temperature. For FRAP measurements, fluorescent images of a single optical section were taken at 1.6-s time intervals before (n = 5) and after bleaching of a circular area at 20 milliwatt nominal laser power with three iterations. Imaging scans were acquired with the laser power attenuated to 0.1–1% of the bleaching intensity. The same laser settings were used for FLIP experiments, where the cells were repeatedly bleached and imaged at intervals of 15 s. For quantitative analysis of FRAP, fluorescence intensities of the bleached region and the entire cell nucleus were measured at each time point. Data were corrected for extracellular background intensity and for the overall loss in total intensity as a result of the bleach pulse itself and of the imaging scans. FLIP measurements were corrected only for the loss of fluorescence intensity caused by the imaging scans, which was determined in neighboring cell nuclei not subjected to bleaching. The relative intensity of the bleached areaIrel was calculated according to Ref. 10Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, and the computer software Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diegeo, CA) was used for nonlinear regression analysis and plotting of the data. Kinetic models assuming the coexistence of one, two, or three individual enzyme fractions with different mobility were tested. In all cases, best fits (according to R2-value and F-test significance) were obtained assuming the coexistence of two enzyme fractions with different mobility. Values of maximal recovery derived from nonlinear regression were used to calculate the proportion of the two enzyme fractions with different mobility, whereas a third, immobile enzyme fraction was calculated by adding up the individual fractions to 100%.DISCUSSIONWe present here for the first time data on the mobility and the dynamics of human topoisomerase I in living cells. We show that the enzyme is fully mobile and in continuous flux between nucleoli and the nucleoplasm. These findings conform to the general concept that nuclear compartments are generated by a binding equilibrium of entirely mobile proteins (14Misteli T. Science. 2001; 291: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In keeping, we show here that topoisomerase I is not restricted to the nucleoli but imposes as a nucleolar protein, because it is moving more slowly in the nucleoli than in the nucleoplasm, whereas the inactive mutant topoisomerase IPhe-723 has the same mobility in both compartments and is therefore more evenly distributed between them.A comparison of FRAP kinetics of GFP-topoisomerase I and untagged GFP shows that, overall, topoisomerase I moves slower than to be expected from free diffusion, which is a usual feature of proteins with a nuclear function (14Misteli T. Science. 2001; 291: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). We show in addition that in each nuclear compartment topoisomerase I is divided into a slow and a fast fraction. We do not know whether these fractions are interconvertible, but the most plausible interpretation is that the enzyme switches between anoff state, where it is more or less freely diffusible (t12 = 1–2 s), and an on state, where it’s mobility is about 10-fold reduced (t12 = 12–14 s). Since topoisomerase I is continuously scanning the entire nuclear space, interactions of the enzyme with processes and places where its activity is required must implicitly be transient. It stands to reason that such interactions will involve less mobile nuclear components, such as chromatin, nuclear matrix, multiprotein complexes, etc. and, therefore, slow down the enzyme (14Misteli T. Science. 2001; 291: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 15Shopland L.S. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F1-F4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the slow fraction (the on state) most likely represents topoisomerase I engaged in processes, whereas the fast fraction (the off state) represents topoisomerase I moving between processes. This interpretation of our data is in good agreement with a “stop-and-go” model recently suggested for the interaction of histone H1 with chromatin (16Hendzel M.J. Boisvert F. Bazett-Jones D.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2051-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar).How does camptothecin fit into such a revised perception of topoisomerase I? The drug is known to bind and stabilize the covalent topoisomerase I·DNA intermediate (18Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). We show here that camptothecin further attenuates the slow fraction of nucleoplasmic topoisomerase I, which supports the above notion of this fraction being the one engaged in DNA turnover. At least in living cells, the drug does not immobilize topoisomerase I completely, which fits some previous biochemical data (19Straub T. Boesenberg C. Meyer K. Gekeler V. Boege F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10777-10783Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showing that topoisomerase I·DNA intermediates stabilized by camptothecin have a comparatively short half-life (<1 min). Why does topoisomerase I disappear so rapidly from its favored nucleolar residence when camptothecin is present? It has been proposed that nucleolar delocalization is triggered by conjugation of the enzyme with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (7Yu Y.Y. Mo Y. Shen Z. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2958-2964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, this process is operating on a minute scale (20Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), whereas we show here that nucleolar delocalization occurs within seconds. Moreover, it is unlikely that an entirely mobile protein like topoisomerase I should require specific signals to move from one place in the nucleus to another. As elaborated in the first paragraph, topoisomerase I is prone to accumulate in the nucleoli, because here it is moving more slowly than in the nucleoplasm. In the presence of camptothecin, however, the situation is rapidly reversed. Now, the enzyme is moving more slowly in the nucleoplasm than in the nucleoli. Accordingly, it accumulates in the nucleoplasm and delocalizes from nucleoli, although it is still freely exchanging between the two compartments. Thus, nucleolar delocalization of topoisomerase I upon exposure to camptothecin seems to be a plausible epiphenomenon of the enzyme’s nuclear traffic and not a reflection of some specific cellular response to the drug. In keeping, topoisomerase IPhe-723, which cannot be stabilized in covalent DNA complexes by camptothecin, does not delocalize from nucleoli upon exposure to the drug, as should be the case, if nucleolar delocalization was due to some kind of a coordinated stress reaction and not a direct consequence of the altered mobility of the enzyme. DNA topoisomerase I changes the pitch of DNA helices by cutting one DNA strand and allowing passage of the complementary strand through the transient nick (1Champoux J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). One important role for this mechanism is the release of torsional stress created by DNA transcription. Thus, topoisomerase I activity is in principle required in the nucleoplasm for mRNA synthesis (2Zhang H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and in the nucleolus for rRNA synthesis (3Muller M.T. Pfund W.P. Mehta V.B. Trask D.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, the latter is considered the major working place of the enzyme, which has been recognized as a predominantly nucleolar protein (3Muller M.T. Pfund W.P. Mehta V.B. Trask D.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4Mo Y.Y. Wang P. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Camptothecin and other agents stabilizing covalent topoisomerase I·DNA intermediates cause relocation of topoisomerase I from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm (5Danks M.K. Garrett K.E. Marion R.C. Whipple D.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1664-1673PubMed Google Scholar). This was also observed with inhibitors of RNA synthesis prompting the conclusion that the phenomenon might be related to reduced activity of rRNA biosynthesis in the nucleolus (6Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.C. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1674-1681PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been proposed that camptothecin-induced conjugation of topoisomerase I with small ubiquitin-like modifiers might serve as a signal triggering translocation of topoisomerase I from the nucleoli to the nucleoplasm (7Yu Y.Y. Mo Y. Shen Z. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2958-2964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Until now the dynamic properties of topoisomerase I in the nucleus or between nuclear compartments have not been assessed directly. Thus, it is not clear whether the enzyme is mobile or not, whether it resides in the nucleolus in a static manner and moves into the nucleoplasm in response to specific signals (as suggested in ref. 7Yu Y.Y. Mo Y. Shen Z. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2958-2964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or whether it shuttles continuously between nucleolus and nucleoplasm.

This tertiary structural element was first identified in β-galactosidase and subsequently observed in copper amine oxidase, hyaluronate lyase, chondroitinase, and maltose phosphorylase. Two cis-peptides are found in each subunit, namely Pro67 and Lys136. The active site is positioned in a rather open cleft, and the electron density corresponding to the bound galactose unequivocally demonstrates that both anomers of the substrate are present in the crystalline enzyme. Those residues responsible for anchoring the sugar to the protein include Arg71, His96, His170, Asp243, and Glu304. Both His96 and His170 are strictly conserved among mutarotase amino acid sequences determined thus far. The imidazole nitrogens of these residues are located within hydrogen bonding distance to the C-5 oxygen of galactose. Strikingly, the carboxylate group of Glu304 is situated at ∼2.7 Å from the 1′-hydroxyl group of galactose, thereby suggesting its possible role as a general acid/base group. Galactose mutarotase plays a key role in normal galactose metabolism by catalyzing the interconversion of β-d-galactose and α-d-galactose.

In most organisms, the conversion of β-d-galactose to glucose 1-phosphate occurs through the action of four enzymes belonging to the Leloir pathway. As indicated in Scheme FS1, galactose mutarotase catalyzes the first step of this pathway, namely the conversion of β-d-galactose to α-d-galactose (1Bouffard G.G. Rudd K.E. Adhya S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). While mutarotase activity was first reported in Escherichia coli in 1965 (2Wallenfels K. Hucho F. Herrmann K. Biochem. Z. 1965; 343: 307-325PubMed Google Scholar), until recently it was commonly believed that intracellular mutarotation of β-d-galactose occurred spontaneously and that this enzyme was not part of the Leloir pathway (1Bouffard G.G. Rudd K.E. Adhya S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Since 1986, however, genes encoding enzymes with mutarotase activities have been identified in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (3Gatz C. Altschmied J. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 31-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),Streptococcus thermophilus (4Poolman B. Royer T.J. Mainzer S.E. Schmidt B.F. J.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4464-4473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Haemophilus influenzae (6Maskell D.J. Szabo M.J. Deadman M.E. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3051-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), E. coli (1Bouffard G.G. Rudd K.E. Adhya S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and Lactococcus lactis (7Erlandson K.A. Delamarre S.C. Batt C.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), for example. A survey of the SWISS-PROT data bank reveals ∼45 amino acid sequences that probably code for mutarotases. These enzymes have typical lengths of between 325 and 390 residues. Amino acid sequence alignments demonstrate that these proteins are homologous with sequence identities ranging from 26 to 38% and sequence similarities ranging from 45 to 58%. Interestingly, however, the mutarotases show no amino acid sequence similarities to other proteins in the data bank. Within recent years, the enzyme from E. coli has been the subject of various biochemical analyses (1Bouffard G.G. Rudd K.E. Adhya S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Beebe J.A. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14989-14997Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Hucho F. Wallenfels K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These investigations have revealed that the enzyme requires neither bound metal ions nor cofactors for activity and that it functions as a monomer. A possible catalytic mechanism, first suggested by Hucho and Wallenfels (9Hucho F. Wallenfels K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), involves the abstraction of a proton from the 1′-hydroxyl group of the sugar by an enzymatic base while a side chain acidic group donates a proton to the C-5 oxygen. This results in cleavage of the ring, thereby yielding the open chain aldehyde. Rotation about the C-1–C-2 bond, followed by abstraction of the proton on the C-5 oxygen and donation of a proton back to the C-1 hydroxyl oxygen leads to product formation. Well over 30 years ago, experiments designed to investigate the dependence of mutarotase activity as a function of pH demonstrated the importance of two functional groups, one serving a catalytic role with a pK of 5.5 and the other functioning in substrate binding with a pK of 7.6 (9Hucho F. Wallenfels K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 23: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recent site-directed mutagenesis experiments targeted at two conserved histidine residues, namely His104 and His175 in E. coli, suggest that these residues play critical roles in the reaction mechanism (8Beebe J.A. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14989-14997Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The possible roles of either aspartates or glutamates in the reaction mechanism of galactose mutarotase were investigated by treating the enzyme with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride or aminomethanesulfonic acid (8Beebe J.A. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14989-14997Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrated a complete loss of enzymatic activity, but the apparent failure to identify a conserved glutamate or aspartate in the amino acid sequence alignments ruled out the possibility of their roles as catalytic bases. Despite the fact that mutarotases have been isolated from various sources including mammals, plants, fungi, and bacteria, there is still no information available regarding their overall three-dimensional architectures. Here we describe the cloning, expression, purification, and high resolution x-ray crystallographic analysis of galactose mutarotase from L. lactis, both in its apo form to 1.9-Å resolution and complexed with α,β-d-galactose to 1.95-Å resolution. This enzyme was selected for study in part because it is believed to play a key role in linking xylan degradation to xylose metabolism (7Erlandson K.A. Delamarre S.C. Batt C.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Indeed, xylan degradation represents one-third of all renewable carbon (10Prade R.A. Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. 1996; 13: 101-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The L. lactis enzyme contains 339 amino acid residues per subunit. From this investigation, it is now known that the enzyme from L. lactis is dimeric rather than monomeric and that its three-dimensional motif is similar to those observed in copper amine oxidase (11Parsons M.R. Convery M.A. Wilmot C.M. Yadav K.D. Blakely V. Corner A.S. Phillips S.E. McPherson M.J. Knowles P.F.

Additionally, this investigation has revealed the manner in which the two conserved histidines, His96 and His170, interact with the sugar substrate. 5-ml cultures of L. lactis var. lactis were grown overnight at 30 °C in LB media. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min, and the cell pellet was suspended in 1 ml water and spun down in a microcentrifuge tube at 14,000 × g for 3 min. The washed cell pellet was suspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer, which consisted of 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS. Subsequently, 1.25 ml of 0.3-mm glass beads were added to the suspension, which was vortexed for 2 min to disrupt the cells. The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and 275 μl of 7.0m ammonium acetate (pH 7.0) were added, followed by incubation for 5 min at 65 °C and then 5 min at 0 °C. 500 μl of chloroform were added, and the mixture was vortexed and then spun at 14,000 × g for 2 min. The aqueous phase was removed, and the genomic DNA was precipitated by the addition of 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol. After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the genomic DNA was recovered by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 5 min, washed with 500 μl of 70% ethanol, and, after drying, suspended in 75 μl of water. The L. lactis var. lactis galactose mutarotase gene was amplified from genomic DNA using the forward primer 5′-CCCACATGTCTATTAAAATAAGAGATTTTGGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTTTGTATGCAAGCTGTAAAT-3′. The forward primer was designed with an AflIII restriction site at the start codon (which led to the mutation of Glu-2 to serine) and the reverse primer with a XhoI restriction site after the codon for the C-terminal lysine residue. This construct allowed for insertion of the PCR gene product into pET28b(+) (Novagen) with a C-terminal His6tag. The PCR amplification was performed via the following protocol with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen): cycle 1, 94 °C for 3 min; cycles 2–31, 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1.5 min, 72 °C for 2 min (per cycle); and, finally, cycle 32, 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen Inc.). The uncut PCR product was subjected to A-tailing modification of the 3′-ends (70 °C for 30 min) using Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The modified PCR product was then ligated into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and used to transform E. coli DH5α cells. These cells were then tested for the PCR insert via blue:white screening of the transformants. Positive (white) colonies were selected and grown overnight in 5-ml cultures of LB media supplemented with ampicillin, and plasmids were purified with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen Inc.). The galactose mutarotase gene was subsequently excised from the pGEM-T Vector construct by digestion with AflIII and XhoI and ligated into pET28b(+) that had been digested with NcoI and XhoI. The pET28b(+)-galactose mutarotase vector was used to transform E. coli DH5α cells, which were then plated onto LB media plates, supplemented with kanamycin. Ten single colonies were selected, cultured, and miniprepped for plasmids. The plasmids were first screened by digestion with NcoI and XhoI. Three plasmids giving positive results (loss of the NcoI restriction site) were then sequenced with the ABI PRISMTM Big Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) to confirm the sequence of the galactose mutarotase gene. For protein expression, the pET28b(+)-galactose mutarotase plasmid was used to transform E. coli Rosetta cells (Novagen). 5-ml cultures were grown in LB media (supplemented with kanamycin and chloramphenicol) for 7 h at 37 °C. 50 μl were then transferred to 250 ml of the supplemented LB media in a 1-liter shaker flask and grown overnight at 37 °C. 10 ml of the overnight culture were transferred into 600 ml of M9 media (supplemented with kanamycin and chloramphenicol) in 2-liter shaker flasks and grown at 37 °C until an optical density of 0.8 was achieved at 600 nm. The temperature of the incubator was lowered to 20 °C, and after 1 h, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cell growth was allowed to continue at 20 °C for an additional 15 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 18 g of frozen cells were thawed in 50 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). The thawed cells were placed in an ice bath and disrupted by three rounds of sonication (1-min duration each) separated by 5 min of cooling. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 25 min. The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a 15-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) that had been previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was then washed with 100 ml of lysis buffer followed by 50 ml of a wash buffer containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). The protein was eluted with a gradient of 100 ml of wash buffer and 100 ml of elution buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 350 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). Protein containing fractions were pooled based on purity as judged by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES and 200 mmNaCl (pH 7.5). The dialyzed protein was concentrated to 17.5 mg/ml based on the extinction coefficient of 0.8 cm/(mg ml) as calculated by the program Protean (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). The coupled assay described by Gatz et al. (3Gatz C. Altschmied J. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 31-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to detect mutarotase activity. Briefly, the reaction mixture consisted of a solution made from 906 μl of 100 mm sodium HEPES (pH 7.5), 30 μl of 100 mmNAD+, and 14 μl of 2688 units/ml glucose dehydrogenase (Sigma). 50 μl of 33.3 mm α-d-glucose were added, and the absorbance was monitored at 340 nm for 2 min for the determination of the spontaneous mutarotation rate. 5 μl of 17.5 mg/ml galactose mutarotase were then added, and the reaction was monitored for another 5 min. The rate calculated after the addition of the enzyme was corrected by subtracting the spontaneous rate, and from this the specific activity was calculated to be 134 units/mg of enzyme, where 1 unit of mutarotase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme needed to convert 1 μmol of α-d-glucose to β-d-glucose per min. The specific activity for α-d-galactose as a substrate was determined in an analogous manner to be 62 units/mg of protein. A search for crystallization conditions was conducted utilizing a sparse matrix screen composed of 144 conditions at both room temperature and at 4 °C via the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion. The best crystals were observed growing at 4 °C from poly(ethylene glycol) 5000-O-methyl ether (PEG-5000-OMe) at pH 6.0. Large single crystals were subsequently obtained from hanging drops with precipitant solutions of 15–19% PEG-5000-OMe buffered with 100 mm MES (pH 6.0) and enzyme concentrations of 17.5 mg/ml. Crystals achieved maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm in ∼1–2 weeks. They belonged to the space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 44.8 Å, b = 76.3 Å, and c = 211.1 Å and contained one dimer in the asymmetric unit. An initial x-ray data set was collected to 2.6-Å resolution at 4 °C with a Bruker HISTAR area detector system equipped with Göbel focusing optics. The x-ray source was CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU200 x-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA. The x-ray data were processed with SAINT (Bruker AXS, Inc.) and internally scaled with XSCALIBRE. 2I. Rayment and G. Wesenberg, unpublished results.

Open table in a new tab Three isomorphous heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking native crystals in either 2 mm methylmercury acetate for 1 day, 25 mm gold thioglucose for 1 day, or 7 mmK2PtCl4 for 7 days. X-ray data were collected for these heavy atom derivatives to 2.6-, 2.6-, and 2.8-Å resolution, respectively. The R-factors between the native and mercury, gold, and platinum derivative data sets were 15.2, 12.1, and 15.9%, respectively (where R = Σ‖FN −Fh‖/Σ‖FN‖ × 100,FN is the native structure factor amplitude, and Fh is the heavy atom derivative structure factor amplitude). Heavy atom binding sites (two per derivative) were determined with SOLVE (17Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The positions, occupancies, and temperature factors of these sites were refined with SOLVE, yielding an overall figure-of-merit of 0.38 and phasing powers of 0.96, 0.68, and 0.82, respectively, for the three derivatives. Protein phases were calculated to 2.6-Å resolution with SOLVE. The rotational and translational matrices relating the two subunits in the asymmetric unit were determined with the program MUNCHKINS (18Rypniewski W.R. Breiter D.R. Benning M.M. Wesenberg G., Oh, B.-H. Markley J.L. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4126-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) based on the positions of the two mercury atom binding sites. These matrices were employed for cyclical averaging with the solvent flattening software, DM (19Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), to give a figure-of-merit of 0.82 for the averaged electron density map. 85% of the residues were built into the averaged electron density map using TURBO (20Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar). The model was then expanded back into the crystallographic cell and refined with TNT (21Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-501Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density maps calculated with coefficients of the form 2 Fo − Fc or Fo − Fc were then averaged with the program AVE in the RAVE suite of programs (22Jones T.A. Dodson E.J. Gover S. Wolf W. Molecular Replacement. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992: 91-105Google Scholar, 23Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1994: 59-66Google Scholar) and allowed for the placement of the remainder of the amino acid residues. Galactose mutarotase crystals were harvested from hanging drop experiments and equilibrated in a synthetic mother liquor composed of 20% PEG-5000-OMe, 200 mm NaCl, and 100 mm MES (pH 6.0). They were then serially transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 25% PEG-5000-OMe, 400 mm NaCl, 17.5% ethylene glycol, and 100 mm MES (pH 6.0). The crystals were suspended in a loop of 20-μm nylon and flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas. Unit cell dimensions changed to a = 42.5 Å, b = 76.1 Å, and c = 206.8 Å upon cooling to 120 K. A native x-ray data set was collected to 1.9-Å resolution and processed and scaled as previously described. This structure was solved via molecular replacement with the program AMORE (24Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) and employing as the search model the partially refined structure determined at 2.6-Å resolution. Initial least-squares refinement to 2.2-Å resolution lowered the R-factor to 28.5%. Electron density maps calculated with either (2 Fo −Fc) or (Fo −Fc) coefficients were subjected to molecular averaging with AVE. An “averaged” model was built and placed back into the unit cell for further least-squares refinement. Iterative cycles of least-squares refinement and manual model building reduced the R-factor to 19.7% for all measured x-ray data from 30.0- to 1.9-Å resolution.

Open table in a new tab d-Galactose—Apogalactose mutarotase crystals were harvested from the hanging drop experiments and equilibrated in a synthetic mother liquor composed of 20% PEG-5000-OMe, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm MES (pH 6.0), and 100 mm α-d-galactose. After equilibration for 24 h at 4 °C, an x-ray data set was collected to 1.95-Å resolution at 4 °C and processed and scaled as previously described. This structure was solved via molecular replacement with the software package AMORE (24Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) and employing as the search model the x-ray coordinates for the native enzyme. Iterative rounds of refinement with TNT and manual manipulation with TURBO reduced the R-factor to 16.1% for all observed data from 30.0- to 1.95-Å resolution. Refinement statistics are presented in Table II. The model for the apoenzyme presented here refined to an R-factor of 19.7% for all measured x-ray data with excellent overall stereochemistry as indicated in Table II. There are two cis-peptide bonds in each subunit, one at Pro67 and the other at Lys136. Pro67 is buried and located at ∼5.5 Å from the active site His96. In contrast, Lys136 is positioned at the subunit:subunit interface. Most of the dihedral angles lie well within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 1a), with only Asp263 adopting torsional angles of φ = ∼59o and ψ = ∼−124°. Asp263 is located in a type II′ turn delineated by Leu262 to Thr265 and is well removed from both the subunit:subunit interface and the active site. The electron densities corresponding to both subunits are well ordered. Only the electron density for the loop delineated by Asn214 to Asp216 in subunit I is somewhat weaker than that observed for the rest of the molecule. Each subunit of the apoenzyme extends continuously from Ser2 to Lys339. A ribbon representation of the galactose mutarotase dimer is presented in Fig. 2. While the mutarotase isolated from E. coli is reported to be monomeric, the packing of the L. lactis enzyme in the crystalline lattice suggested a dimeric quaternary structure. Indeed, the buried surface area between the two subunits in the asymmetric unit, based on a probe radius of 1.4 Å, is 1900 Å2 (25Zhang X.-J. Matthews B.W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 624-630Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Subsequent ultracentrifugation experiments confirmed the dimeric nature of the galactose mutarotase from L. lactis. 3J. Kim, personal communication.Each subunit contributes primarily three regions of secondary structure to form the dimeric interface: 1) a type I′ turn defined by Gly9 and Ser12 and connecting the first two β-strands, 2) a type I turn/β-strand motif delineated by Glu100 to Tyr109, and 3) a succession of type II, type II, and type I′ turns lying between Asn127 and Lys136. The subunit:subunit interface is fairly hydrophilic, with numerous hydrogen bonds between side chains and/or backbone atoms. As an example, the ε-amino group of Lys105 (subunit I) lies within hydrogen bonding distance to Oδ1 of Asn127 and O of Val125 (subunit II). In turn, Nδ2 of Asn127 (subunit II) lies within hydrogen bonding distance to the carbonyl oxygens of both Glu99 and Glu100 in subunit I. Numerous water molecules line the subunit:subunit interface. The overall dimensions of the apoenzyme are ∼50 × 86 × 83 Å. The structures of the two subunits contained within the asymmetric unit are exceedingly similar such that all of their atoms superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.70 Å. Each monomer, with overall dimensions of 46 × 60 × 52 Å, folds into one domain that is dominated by extensive layers of β-sheet. The three-dimensional architecture of the monomer, which can be aptly described as a β-sandwich, is similar to the 18-stranded, anti-parallel motif observed for domain 5 of β-galactosidase (14Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). In the galactose mutarotase, there are 28 strands of β-sheet connected by three small α-helices and nine type I, six type I′, nine type II, three type II′, and three type III reverse turns. The strands of β-sheet range in length from 2 to 11 residues. A topological drawing of the three-dimensional architecture of galactose mutarotase is presented in Fig. 3. The N and C termini are located on the same side of the molecule and separated by ∼26 Å. d-Galactose—The quality of the model for galactose mutarotase complexed with α,β-d-galactose is outstanding as indicated by an R-factor of 16.1% for all measured x-ray data and overall excellent geometry. A Ramachandran plot for the model is presented in Fig. 1b. The two subunits in the asymmetric unit superimpose with root mean square deviations of 0.25 and 0.60 Å for α-carbons and all atoms, respectively. Both the N and C termini are well ordered, and, like the apoenzyme structure, there are no breaks in the polypeptide chains for either subunit. In fact, the His tag at the C terminus of subunit II is completely ordered, adopts an extended conformation, and is involved in crystal contacts. It is located at ∼30 Å from the active site. There are very few structural differences between the apo and sugar-bound forms of the enzyme such that their α-carbon atoms and all atoms superimposed with root mean square deviations of 0.30 and 0.70 Å, respectively. Indeed, the sugar substrate is accommodated within the active site via movement of solvent molecules rather than major perturbations of side chain conformations except for that of Phe279. The aromatic ring of Phe279 shifts somewhat to accommodate the 1′-hydroxyl group of galactose in its α-anomeric configuration. The active site of the enzyme is located in a quite wide and shallow cleft, explaining in part the broad specificity of the enzyme toward various sugar substrates. The two active sites in the dimer are separated by ∼43 Å. The electron densities corresponding to the bound galactose moieties are well ordered in both subunits. Shown in Fig. 4 is the observed electron density corresponding to the galactose moiety bound in subunit II. As can be seen, the electron density indicates a mixture of both the α- and β-anomers of d-galactose. For model refinement purposes, the occupancies corresponding to the two configurations of the 1′-hydroxyl groups were set to 0.5. In both subunits I and II, the B-factors for the 1′-hydroxyl groups in the β-anomeric positions are ∼24 Å2, whereas those for the α-anomeric positions are ∼12 Å2. While caution must be applied in the interpretation of temperature factors, these B-values suggest that the two configurations about the anomeric carbon of galactose are not equally distributed in the crystalline enzyme. Interestingly, at equilibrium in aqueous solutions at 40 °C, the percentage of d-galactose in the β-configuration is between 64 and 73% (26Loudon G.M. Organic Chemistry. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., Inc., Menlo Park, CA1998: 1209Google Scholar). The average B-values for all the galactose atoms are 22.8 and 20.3 Å2, in subunits I and II, respectively. A close up view of the active site for subunit II, in the context of secondary structure, is presented in Fig. 5a. Key residues involved in sugar binding include Arg71, His96, His170, Asp243, and Glu304. In addition to forming hydrogen bonds with the sugar ligand, the guanidinium group of Arg71 also participates in a salt bridge with the carboxylate group of Glu90. Arg71 is located in a coil region of secondary structure. His96 is positioned in a type I′ turn defined by Leu95–Gly98, whereas His170, Asp243, and Glu304 are located on β-strands. Both His96 and His170, separated by ∼4 Å, are strictly conserved among 34 galactose mutarotase sequences examined in the SWISS-PROT data bank. Additionally, Arg71, Asp243, and Glu304 are strictly conserved among 33 of the sequences. In the cases where these residues are not conserved, they are replaced with a histidine, a glutamate, and a glutamine, respectively. Those amino acid residues lying within 5 Å of galactose are indicated in Fig. 5b. Both hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains contribute to the formation of this sugar-binding region. The bottom part of the binding pocket, as oriented in Fig. 5b, is somewhat hydrophobic and lined with three aromatic residues, Tyr172, Phe279, and Phe283. Tyr172 is conserved among 33 galactose mutarotases but is replaced with a leucine in one of the sequences. Likewise, the aromatic nature of Phe279 is conserved among the mutarotases with four containing phenylalanines at this position and the other 30 containing tyrosines. Two additional hydrophobic residues, Tyr60 and Leu95, form the top half of the binding pocket and are not strictly conserved. There are eight water molecules lying within 5 Å of the galactose moiety. A schematic diagram of the potential hydrogen bonding interactions between the galactose ligand and the protein is shown in Fig. 6. Four water molecules interact with the substrate. One is situated within 2.9 Å of the 6′-hydroxyl group, while the second resides near the 3′-hydroxyl group (2.8 Å). A third water molecule bridges the 2′-hydroxyl group (2.7 Å) and the 1′-hydroxyl group when it is in the β-configuration (3.2 Å). The fourth water lies within 3.1 Å of the 1′-hydroxyl group in the β-configuration. The Nε2 atoms of His96 and His170 are located within ∼3 Å of the C-5 oxygen. Strikingly, the carboxylate group of Glu304 is positioned to interact with both the α- and β-anomeric forms of galactose. As indicated in Fig. 6, the carboxylate group of Asp243anchors the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of galactose to the protein. The guanidinium group of Arg71 interacts with both the 3′- and 4′-hydroxyl groups of the sugar. The successful three-dimensional structural analysis of β-galactosidase from E. coli in the laboratory of Dr. Brian Matthews represented both a monumental effort and an x-ray crystallographic milestone (14Jacobson R.H. Zhang X.J. DuBose R.F. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The structure of this remarkable enzyme was described in terms of five motifs: domain 1 containing a jelly-roll fold, domains 2 and 4 having immunoglobulin folds, domain 3 composed of an α/β barrel and containing the active site residues, and domain 5, which was likened to a β-sandwich. In 1994, domain 5 was thought to possess a novel architecture. Since that time, additional proteins have been observed to contain this motif including the central domain of copper amine oxidase (11Parsons M.R. Convery M.A. Wilmot C.M. Yadav K.D. Blakely V. Corner A.S. Phillips S.E. McPherson M.J. Knowles P.F.

Biol. 1999; 288: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the C-terminal domain of hyaluronate lyase (12Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal domain of maltose phosphorylase (15Egloff M.-P. Uppenberg J. Haalck L. Van Tilbeurgh H. Structure. 2001; 9: 689-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A search with the DALI server (27Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) revealed that, indeed, galactose mutarotase belongs to this growing family of proteins containing a β-sandwich motif. Unlike the other proteins studied thus far, however, the β-sandwich motif constitutes the entire structure of galactose mutarotase. A superposition of domain 5 of β-galactosidase onto the galactose mutarotase subunit is presented in Fig. 7. While there is no sequence homology between these proteins, the overall tertiary structural similarities are striking. None of the active site residues in galactose mutarotase are conserved in domain 5 of β-galactosidase. β-galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and β-d-galactose, which is then the substrate for galactose mutarotase. It can be speculated that, perhaps, the ancient β-galactosidase was a bifunctional protein containing both β-galactosidase and mutarotase activities. Interestingly, as indicated in the SWISS-PROT data bank, the galactose mutarotase in yeast is part of a larger polypeptide chain containing a sequence coding for UDP-galactose 4-epimerase at its N-terminal region. As such, there is clearly precedence in sugar metabolism for multiple activities contained within one polypeptide chain. The most commonly accepted catalytic mechanism for galactose mutarotase involves three key features: 1) abstraction of the 1′-hydroxyl hydrogen by an enzymatic base, 2) protonation of the C-5 oxygen by an active site acid, and 3) rotation about C-1–C-2 bond when the open chain aldehyde is formed. These features can now be addressed in terms of structure as outlined in Scheme FS2. Most likely, Glu304, with its side chain carboxylate group positioned at ∼2.7 Å from the 1′-hydroxyl group of galactose, functions to initiate the reaction. Both His96 and His170 lie within 3 Å of the C-5 oxygen. Either is positioned to serve as the active site acid required to protonate the C-5 oxygen, and it is not clear from the present structure which one serves in such capacity. From the recent and insightful site-directed mutagenesis experiments conducted on the E. coli galactose mutarotase, it is known that mutations of either of these histidines result in sharp decreases in enzymatic activities (8Beebe J.A. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14989-14997Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Indeed, for the H104Q mutant protein (corresponding to His96 in the L. lactis enzyme), a 4000-fold decrease in kcat/Km was observed as compared with the native enzyme. Additionally, the catalytic activity of the H175A mutant protein of the E. coli mutarotase (corresponding to His170 in the L. lactis enzyme) was too low to measure. Thus, it might be speculated that His170 functions as the catalytic acid in the L. lactis galactose mutarotase. Experiments designed to further address the roles of Glu304, His96, and His170 in the catalytic mechanism of galactose mutarotase are in progress. We thank Dr. Frank M. Raushel for critically reading the manuscript. We also thank Dr. John Lindquist (Department of Bacteriology, University of Wisconsin) for supplying L. lactis var. lactis cell stock. 1L7J1L7K"

https://openalex.org/W2101874950,"The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of onco-Dbl, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42 and RhoA GTPases, interacts with phosphoinositides (PIPs). This interaction modulates both the GEF activity and the targeting to the plasma membrane of onco-Dbl. Conversely, we have previously shown that in proto-Dbl an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal domain and the PH domain imposes a negative regulation on both the DH and PH functions, suppressing its transforming activity. Here we have further investigated the mode of regulation of proto-Dbl by generating proto-Dbl mutants deleted of the last C-terminal 50 amino acids, which contain a PEST motif, and/or unable to bind to PIPs due to substitutions of the positively charged residues of the PH domain. The PH mutants of proto-Dbl retained a relative weak GEF activity toward Cdc42 and RhoA in vitro, but their RhoA activating potential was impaired in vivo. Further, these mutants lost both the plasma membrane targeting and the transforming activities, contrary to the PH mutants of onco-Dbl that retained the exchange activity both in vitro and in vivo and showed significant, but partially, reduced transforming activity. Deletion of the C-terminal sequences from onco-Dbl did not affect its function, whereas similar deletion of proto-Dbl led to an increase of transforming activity. Analysis of the half-life of the proto-Dbl mutants revealed that deletion of the C-terminal sequences increases the stability of the protein. Overall, the transformation potential of proto-Dbl mutants was associated with an augmented localization of the protein to the plasma membrane and a strong activation of Jun N-terminal kinase activity and transcription of cyclin D1. Together with previous observations, these data suggest that the biological activity of proto-Dbl is tightly regulated by a combination of mechanisms that involve intramolecular interaction, PH binding to PIPs, and the N- and C-terminal domain-dependent turnover of the protein.

Small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family belong to a group of signaling molecules involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes, including actin cytoskeleton reorganization, transcriptional regulation, membrane trafficking, and cell growth control and development (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5226) Google Scholar, 2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). These proteins function as molecular switches, cycling between a GDP-bound, inactive form and a GTP-bound, active form. The nucleotide-bound state of Rho family GTPases is controlled by three classes of proteins: the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorDHDbl homologyPHpleckstrin homologyPIphosphatidylinositolPIPphosphatidylinositol phosphatePI45P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePI34,5P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphateDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumGSTglutathione S-transferaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseHAhemagglutininWTwild type that stimulate the dissociation of the tightly bound GDP nucleotide in response to upstream signals; the GTPase-activating proteins that promote the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho proteins, leading to the inactive GDP-bound form; and the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors that act by preventing spontaneous and GEF-catalyzed release of nucleotide, thereby maintaining the GTPases in the inactive state (3Cerione R.A.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), is located immediately C-terminal to the Dbl homology (DH) domain, responsible for catalyzing the nucleotide exchange on Rho GTPases (3Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the biological functions of DH-containing GEFs, such as actin cytoskeleton regulation, cell growth stimulation, and transformation, are intimately dependent upon their ability to interact with and activate Rho GTPases. The Dbl family GEF proteins seem to exist as inactive or partially active molecules until specific intracellular stimuli lead to their activation. In some cases, the inactive basal state is maintained by a self-regulatory mechanism that involves an intramolecular interaction between different domains of GEFs themselves. Proto-Vav protein regulation, for example, involves an intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal sequences and the Rho GTPase binding site of the DH domain (7Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The signaling mechanisms mediating the GEF activation have been investigated intensively. Phosphorylation of Tyr174 of proto-Vav by Src-like kinases, for example, results in its activation (7Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), while phosphorylation of Tiam1 by protein kinase C II causes the activation of the protein by inducing its translocation to the plasma membrane (8Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Buchanan F.G. Downes C.P. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12753-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Upstream signals such as heterotrimeric G-proteins may also contribute in varying degrees to the GEF activation, as in the case of p115RhoGEF, which utilizes its N terminus to couple directly to Gα12/Gα13, resulting in an enhanced GEF catalytic activity and membrane translocation (9Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sterweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Moreover, the recruitment of Cdc24p, a yeast Dbl family member, to the plasma membrane requires Far1p that recruits in turn Cdc24p to activated Gβγ during mating response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae(10Nern A. Arkowitz A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1187-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 11Butty A.C. Pryciak L.S. Huang S. Herskowitz I. Peter M.

In addition, inositol phospholipids binding to the PH domain has been reported to regulate GEF activity. Vav is regulated through binding of PH domain to phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase substrates and products (13Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R. Murali K. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 14Ma A.D. Metjian A. Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PI4,5P2 promotes inhibitory intramolecular interactions between DH and PH domains, whereas PI3,4,5P3 activates Vav GEF activity by disrupting these interaction. Similarly, PIP binding to Sos PH domain mediates the interactions between DH and PH regulating Sos GEF activity (15Jefferson A.B. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2303-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The prototype member of Dbl family GEFs is the proto-Dbl protein, a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein of 115 kDa containing a long stretch of amino acids within its NH2-terminal half with the potential to form an α-helical coiled-coil (16Ron D. Tronick S.A. Aaronson A. Eva A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2465-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Graziani G. Ron D. Eva A. Srivastava S.K. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 823-829PubMed Google Scholar). This region negatively regulates the transforming activity of proto-Dbl through direct interaction with the PH domain. This interaction limits the access of Rho GTPases to the DH domain and masks the intracellular targeting function of the PH domain (18Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistent with this mechanism of inhibition, oncogenic activation of proto-Dbl occurs by truncation of the amino-terminal 497 residues (16Ron D. Tronick S.A. Aaronson A. Eva A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2465-2473Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Ron D. Graziani G. Aaronson A. Eva A. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1067-1072PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we have further investigated the mechanism of proto-Dbl regulation. We approached this in two ways. First, given our findings demonstrating that the PH domain of onco-Dbl binds to PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 and that this interaction modulates onco-Dbl protein transforming activity and intracellular localization (20Russo C. Gao Y. Mancini P. Vanni C. Porotto M. Falasca M. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effects of PIPs binding to PH domain on proto-Dbl GEF activity and examined how the lipid binding might influence the cellular location, transcription stimulation, and transformation activities. Second, we studied the contribution of the C terminus 50 amino acids of proto-Dbl to proto-Dbl regulation. Although this region contains PEST-like sequences (21Rechsteiner M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 16: 433-440Google Scholar), its influence on proto-Dbl function has not been established. The effects of proto-Dbl mutations made at the PH domain and/or C terminus on their response to PIPs, GEF activity, subcellular localization, transcription regulation, protein stability, and transformation are examined in detail. The results shed new light on the complex regulatory mechanism of proto-Dbl that might be employed in a similar context by other Dbl family members. NIH3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. Mass cultures of stable transfected cell lines were generated by transfecting NIH3T3 cells with 300 ng of plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 375 μg/ml G418 (22Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For kinase assays, cells were grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and transiently transfected with 8 μg of the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE PLUS as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Twenty hours after transfection the medium was changed to DMEM containing 0.5% fetal calf serum, and the cells were incubated for another 24 h before lysis. The proto-Dbl ΔC mutant, which lacks the last C-terminal 50 amino acids, was generated by substituting the C terminus region (residues 554–925) with the C terminus region (residues 554–875) derived from onco-Dbl PMA3 deletion mutant (23Ron D. Zannini M. Lewis R.B. Wickner L.T. Hunt L.T. Graziani G. Tronick S.R. Aaronson S.A. Eva A. New Biol. 1991; 3: 372-379PubMed Google Scholar). The proto-Dbl ΔC PH-t was obtained in a similar way by substituting the C-terminal region of proto-Dbl with the C-terminal region of DH/PH-t (residues 554–875), which carries substitutions of Lys712 to Ala, Lys714 to Ala, and Arg724 to Gly (PH-t) (20Russo C.

Mutations within the PH domain of proto-Dbl full-length (i.e. substitutions of Lys712 to Ala, Lys714 to Ala, and Arg724 to Gly (PH-t)) were introduced by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The products were sequence-proofed by the T7 Sequenase version 2.0 kit (Amersham Biosciences). All proto-Dbl mutant cDNAs were subcloned into the pCefl-GST vector (kindly provided by S. Gutkind). To assay and compare the in vitro GEF activities, the GST fusions of proto-Dbl mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells and purified using glutathione-agarose affinity beads as described (24Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 167: 31-40Crossref Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). GDP/GTP exchange assays were carried out similarly as described before (25Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 254: 311-314Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar). 2 μg of Cdc42 loaded with [3H]GDP were incubated with a buffer mixture containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 μm GTP, 5 mm MgCl2 (buffer A) with proto-Dbl proteins in the presence or absence of various lipids for the indicated time at 25 °C. The exchange reaction was stopped by dilution into 10 ml of ice-cold buffer A without excess GTP, and the protein-bound nucleotide was trapped by filtration onto nitrocellulose filters. The GST-PAK-CRIB domain fusion protein (residues 56–141, kindly provided by J. Collard), containing the Cdc42 and Rac binding region of human PAK1, and the GST-mDIA fusion protein (residues −2 to 304, kindly provided by S.

The expression of proto-Dbl mutants in stably transfected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Aliquots of cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting by using a specific polyclonal antibody against Dbl (16Ron D. Tronick S.A. Aaronson A. Eva A.

To evaluate Cdc42 activation, the stably transfected cell lines were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer before lysis on the dish in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 40 μg of GST-PAK. Lysates were incubated with 60 μl of glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C under constant rotation. To evaluate RhoA activation, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. The lysates were then clarified and incubated with 30 μg of GST-RBD fusion protein conjugated with glutathione beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Bound Cdc42 and RhoA were detected in Western blot by using polyclonal antibody against Cdc42 and monoclonal antibody anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). pCDNA3 HA-JNK or pCDNA3 HA-ROCK constructs were cotransfected in COS cells with pCefl-GST vector, pCefl GST-proto-Dbl, GST-proto-Dbl PH-t, GST-proto-Dbl ΔC, and GST-proto-Dbl ΔC PH-t constructs. JNK kinase activity was determined as described (28Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P., Xu, N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar), using purified bacterially expressed GST-ATF2 fusion protein as substrate. ROCK kinase activity was determined in the same way by using myelin basic protein (Sigma) as substrate. The HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by using an anti-HA antibody (Babco), separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.), which were used for both autoradiography and Western blot analysis to evaluate kinase and proto-Dbl protein expression level. Immunocomplexes were visualized by West Dura extended chemiluminescent detection (Pierce) using protein G horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Pierce). For determination of NF-κB- and cyclin D1-dependent gene expression, the NF-κB- and cyclin D1-luciferase reporter plasmids (Stratagene) that contain the promoter response elements of NF-κB or cyclin D1 were used in transient co-transfections. Transfection into NIH3T3 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Analysis of luciferase expression in the cotransfected cells was carried out by using a luciferase assay kit from Promega Subconfluent cultures containing 5 × 106 cells were starved for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM without serum, cysteine, and methionine. Thus, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cystine (500 μCi/plate of Pro-mixl-35S; Amersham Biosciences). 30 min later, medium was removed and replaced with DMEM containing an excess of cold methionine and cysteine followed by incubation in the same medium for the chase period. Stable NIH3T3 transfectants expressing GST-proto-Dbl, GST-proto-Dbl PH-t, GST-proto-Dbl ΔC, or GST-proto-Dbl ΔC PH-t proteins were plated onto glass coverslips, previously coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 25 °C, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. The fusion proteins were visualized with anti-GST polyclonal antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel; Organon Teknika Corp.). Coverslips were mounted onto slides in 60% glycerol-Tris-buffered saline, and cells were observed by a Zeiss confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To investigate the mechanisms of regulation of proto-Dbl activity, we generated three mutants carrying alterations in the coding sequences. We have previously demonstrated that positively charged amino acids, located in the first loop of the Dbl PH domain, are necessary for binding to PIPs and for the efficient outcome of Dbl transforming activity (20Russo C. Gao Y. Mancini P. Vanni C. Porotto M. Falasca M. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To evaluate the possible effect of PIP binding on proto-Dbl function and to make a comparison with that on onco-Dbl, we mutagenized the PH domain in proto-Dbl by substituting Lys712 to Ala, Lys714 to Ala, and Arg724 to Gly (PH-t). To examine whether the C-terminal region of proto-Dbl protein is involved in the regulation of this protein function, we generated a truncated form of the protein in which the C-terminal 50 amino acids were deleted (proto-Dbl ΔC). Further, we generated a double mutant in which the PH-t was inserted in the proto-Dbl ΔC cDNA (proto-Dbl ΔC PH-t) (Fig. 1). The previously described (20Russo C. Gao Y. Mancini P. Vanni C. Porotto M. Falasca M. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) C-terminal truncated mutant of oncogenic Dbl (DH/PH) and its corresponding PH mutant (DH/PH-t) (Fig. 1) were also used for comparison. To determine the effects of the PH domain mutations and C-terminal deletion on proto-Dbl GEF activity, we transiently transfected wild type GST-proto-Dbl and each of the GST-proto-Dbl mutants in COS cells. Dbl DH/PH and Dbl DH/PH-t were used as control. Each protein was purified from COS cell lysates by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography and tested in vitro for GEF activity on Cdc42. Equal amounts of purified GST-fused proto-Dbl, proto-Dbl ΔC, proto-Dbl PH-t, proto-Dbl ΔC PH-t, Dbl DH/PH, and DH/PH-t proteins (Fig. 2 A) were assayed for their ability to release [3H]GDP from 2 μg of Cdc42-[3H]GDP. As previously reported (18Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we observed that while DH/PH was very efficient in stimulating GDP dissociation such that over 80% of bound GDP was dissociated within 10 min, proto-Dbl displayed a rather weak activity catalyzing only 30% of GDP dissociation from Cdc42 within the same time period (Fig. 2 B). When the abilities of proto-Dbl and onco-Dbl PH mutants to release [3H]GDP from purified Cdc42 were compared with their wild type counterparts at 10 min in the same assay conditions, no significant differences were observed (Fig. 2 C). The proto-Dbl and its mutants contained significantly less GEF activity than that observed for onco-Dbl DH/PH and DH/PH-t (Fig. 2 C). We next analyzed proto-Dbl proteins for their ability to stimulate [3H]GDP/GTP exchange from Cdc42 in the presence of PIPs by incubating proto-Dbl proteins for 10 min in the GEF reaction mixture in the presence of 10 μm PI4,5P2 or PI3,4,5P3. As previously reported (20Russo C. Gao Y. Mancini P. Vanni C. Porotto M. Falasca M. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), Dbl DH/PH protein GEF activity was inhibited by PIPs, whereas the protein carrying the mutant PH domain, which is unable to bind PIPs, was not affected by them (Fig. 3). Similarly, the inhibitory effect of PI4,5P2 and PI3,4,5P3 was evident on proto-Dbl and proto-Dbl ΔC (Fig. 3), whereas proto-Dbl PH-t and proto-Dbl ΔC PH-t were not affected by PIPs in their GEF capacity (Fig. 3). Thus, these results suggest that similar to the onco-Dbl case, PI4,5P2 or PI3,4,5P3 binding to the PH domain negatively regulates proto-Dbl GEF activity in vitro, and substitutions of positively charged amino acids to neutral ones in the PH domain β1-β2 loop do not affect the intrinsic catalytic activity but rather the PIP-elicited inhibitory response. To determine whether the GEF activity of the proto-Dbl protein in vivo is affected by binding to PIPs or by the presence of the C-terminal sequences, COS cells were transiently transfected with proto-Dbl, proto-Dbl ΔC, proto-Dbl PH-t, or proto-Dbl ΔC PH-t constructs, and the active Cdc42-GTP and RhoA-GTP were collected on GST-PAK-CRIB and GST-mDIA fusion proteins, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4 A, expression of proto-Dbl mutants effectively induced activation of endogenous Cdc42 in these cells. Densitometric analysis revealed that the expression of proto-Dbl ΔC, proto-Dbl PH-t, and proto-Dbl ΔC PH-t mutants increased the active Cdc42-GTP level by 5-fold in comparison with proto-Dbl WT. On the other hand, the expression of proto-Dbl ΔC increases RhoA activation by ∼3-fold, whereas both PH-t mutants, with or without the C terminus sequences, were not able to activate Rho A GTPase above background level (Fig. 4 B). The differences observed in GTPases activation were not due to differences in onco-Dbl and proto-Dbl expression levels, since no significant variations in protein amounts were detected by immunoblotting with specific anti-Dbl antibody (Fig. 4). Moreover, as previously reported (20Russo C. Gao Y. Mancini P. Vanni C. Porotto M. Falasca M. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), DH/PH and DH/PH-t both effectively induced activation of endogenous Cdc42 and RhoA (Fig. 4, A and B, respectively). Thus, loss of PH binding to PIPs results in different effects on proto-Dbl and Dbl mutants' ability to activate RhoA; DH/PH-t is still able to activate RhoA, while the PH mutants of proto-Dbl have lost this ability. Interestingly, deletion of the C-terminal sequences further enhance the RhoA-specific GEF activity, suggesting a negative regulatory action of these sequences on proto-Dbl catalytic activity in cells. Rho family GTPases exert their effect at least in part through the activation of serine-threonine kinase signaling pathways. It has been shown that onco-Dbl transformed cells show significantly elevated JNK activity (28Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P., Xu, N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 29Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). To explore how the mutations in the PH domain and the C-terminal deletion of proto- and onco-Dbl affect JNK activation, we transiently transfected COS cells with plasmids encoding for HA-JNK in the absence or presence of proto-Dbl or onco-Dbl cDNA constructs. Cells were harvested 24 h after incubation in serum-free medium. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the expression of proto-Dbl ΔC increased JNK activity by 5-fold compared with WT proto-Dbl. In fact, the activity of JNK in proto-Dbl ΔC transfectants was comparable with that detected in cells transfected with onco-Dbl DH/PH (Fig. 5 B). The expression level of each proto-Dbl and onco-Dbl product was comparable in all of the samples analyzed, as shown by immunoblotting analysis of total cell lysates with anti-Dbl antibody (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the presence of the C terminus 50 amino acids greatly affects the ability of proto-Dbl to activate JNK. In contrast, a basal JNK kinase activity was detected in proto-Dbl PH-t- and proto-Dbl ΔC PH-t-transfected cells, whereas DH/PH-t displayed a reduced capability of activating JNK compared with its wild type counterpart. Thus, mutations in the PH domain seem to affect the ability of both proto-Dbl and onco-Dbl to activate JNK. It has been recently reported that both Dbl and Rho family members can stimulate transcription from NF-κB-responsive elements (30Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12779-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 31Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that transformation of NIH3T3 cells by onco-Dbl may require NF-κB activation (32Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined how the PH mutations and C-terminal deletion affect NF-κB activation by proto-Dbl and Dbl expression. NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with each of the proto-Dbl and onco-Dbl constructs in the presence of the NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid that contains the promoter response elements of NF-κB. We observed a significant activation of luciferase activity in all of the samples analyzed in comparison with the activity of the vector alone (Fig. 6 A), suggesting that the PH mutations as well as the deletion of the C-terminal 50 amino acids do not interfere with NF-κB activation in the transfected cells. It has been demonstrated that stimulation of cyclin D1 transcription cor"

The biophysical basis for the exceptional ability of selectins to mediate cell capture (tethering) and rolling adhesions under highly disruptive forces is still obscure (3Miller J. Knorr R.

This ability has been primarily attributed to fast formation rates of selectin bonds and to the ability of selectin tethers to tolerate rupture by elevated shear forces (7Alon R. Hammer D.A. Springer T.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 8Alon R. Chen S. Puri K.D. Finger E.B. Springer T.A. J.

A. 2001; 98: 10166-10171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A major unresolved question regarding selectin function is the high effective formation rate of selectin tethers to their physiological counterreceptors. Efficient tether formation, in particular by L-selectin, contrasts with the fairly lowkon of intrinsic L-selectin bonds (11Nicholson M.W. Barclay A.N. Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Thiskon falls in a range shared by other molecular pairs with poor tethering capacity under shear flow (12van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13Chen S. Alon R. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3172-3177Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has thus become increasingly evident that selectin tethering to ligand is controlled by mechanical properties in addition to the biochemical properties measured under shear-free conditions (14Puri K.D. Chen S. Springer T.A. Nature. 1998; 392: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition to the fast effective kinetics of bond formation and intrinsically high mechanical stability of individual bonds (5Chang K.C. Tees D.F. Hammer D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11262-11267Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), three other mechanisms have been proposed to account for the exceptionally high capacity of selectins to form tethers under physiological flow. Association of L-selectin with the actin cytoskeleton through its cytoplasmic domain was recently shown to reduce tether dissociation rates under flow and to enhance the mechanical stability of selectin tethers, independent of the intrinsic stability of the selectin:ligand bond (16Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This stabilization was suggested to involve tail-mediated restriction of the selectin's mobility at the membrane, which facilitates its rebinding to a recently dissociated ligand on a countersurface (16Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, a regulatory role for the EGF1 domain has been recently suggested to explain the efficiency by which the lectin domain of cell-based or cell-free L-selectin recognizes surface-bound ligand (15Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recent studies also demonstrated that dimerization of L-selectin or P-selectin, as well as the selectin ligand, PSGL-1, augments selectin-mediated rolling in different cellular systems (10Ramachandran V. Yago T. Epperson T.K. Kobzdej M.M. Nollert M.U. Cummings R.D. Zhu C. McEver R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10166-10171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Li X. Steeber D.A.

The generation of multimeric binding by receptor oligomerization may provide a rapid means for dispersion of highly disruptive shear forces over multiple bonds. A role for selectin or ligand clustering in promoting cell adhesion under flow is feasible because all known physiological selectin ligands present multiple carbohydrate ligands on mucin-like scaffolds or on complex multivalent glycans (2Kansas G.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 3259-3287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Rosen S.D. Bertozzic R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 261-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Yeh J.C.

Selectins are also often found clustered on leukocyte surfaces (18Setiadi H. Sedgewick G. Erlandsen S.L. McEver R.P. J.

Cell. 1995; 82: 989-999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) although the contribution of spontaneous L-selectin clustering to the selectin adhesiveness under physiological shear flow has not been established. In the present study, we assessed the effect of L-selectin dimerization on its adhesiveness to various purified L-selectin ligands and under various conditions of shear flow. The extensive data previously obtained on both the biochemical nature and clustering properties of PSGL-1 and its individual selectin-binding carbohydrates and backbone residues (19Snapp K.R.

Invest. 1997; 100: 485-491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) render this ligand an ideal model to assess how L-selectin dimerization and ligand presentation affect specific kinetic properties of selectin tethers under defined flow conditions. We therefore focused our study on native neutrophil-derived PSGL-1 as well as on synthetically generated PSGL-1-derived glycopeptides (25Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, dimerization of L-selectin was found to alter entirely different properties of L-selectin tethers to PSGL-1 than those previously reported for P-selectin dimerization (10Ramachandran V. Yago T. Epperson T.K. Kobzdej M.M. Nollert M.U. Cummings R.D. Zhu C. McEver R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10166-10171Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). L-selectin dimerization enhanced the tether formation rate without altering tether stability and did so only on ligands presented on an adhesive surface at densities above a critical threshold. Notably, increased shear stresses endowed dimerized L-selectin with the ability to increase its avidity even to highly diluted ligands. Thus, selectin dimerization results in enhanced avidity and tether formation conditional to proper ligand spacing and adequate conditions of shear flow. In contrast to dimerization, EGF domain substitution on L-selectin with a P-selectin EGF domain enhances tether formation regardless of ligand density or shear flow, suggesting that this domain controls intrinsic rather than dimerization properties of L-selectin.

Biotin-labeled PSGL-1-derived sLex-decorated glycopeptide and a non-fucosylated control peptide, both corresponding to the 19-residue N′ terminus of human PSGL-1, and each containing a single biotin group at its C′ terminus, were synthesized as previously described (25Somers W.S.

Fucoidin, a plant-derived sulfated polyfucan that saturably blocks the lectin domains of L-selectin and P-selectin (32Rosen S.D. Bertozzi C.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), bovine serum albumin (fraction V), and Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hank's balanced salt solution, were obtained from Sigma. Human serum albumin, HSA (Fraction V) was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The stable expression of cDNA-encoding native human L-selectin or the L-selectin chimera, LPL, in which the EGF-like domain of L-selectin was replaced with the homologous domain from P-selectin in the mouse pre-B cell line 300.19 has been described elsewhere (33Kansas G.S.

Clones expressing similar levels of native L-selectin and LPL were maintained in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 0.1 μm 2-mercaptoethanol and antibiotics. PSGL-1 was diluted to concentrations of 0.001–0.2 μg/ml in coating medium (PBS supplemented with 20 mm bicarbonate, pH 8.5) and adsorbed onto a polystyrene plate for 15 h at 4 °C. Stock solutions of GlyCAM-1, fucoidin, or DREG-200 were diluted in coating medium and adsorbed onto the plates at 37 °C for 2 h. All substrates were washed five times with PBS and blocked with PBS supplemented with 2% HSA for 2 h at 4 °C. The site density of the L-selectin recognition sites on immobilized PSGL-1 was determined by radioimmunoassay using 125I-labeled PL1 mAb performed as described (15Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). GlyCAM-1 site densities were assessed using125I-labeled CAM02 as described (15Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Site densities were determined for PSGL-1 and GlyCAM-1 coated at input concentrations >0.05 μg/ml. Below this value, the site densities of both ligands were estimated from a linear regression of mAb binding to substrates coated with these mucins at concentrations between 0.05 and 0.2 μg/ml. PSGL-1-derived glycopeptides were immobilized on substrates coated with a nonglycosylated form of avidin, neutralite avidin (31Marttila A.T. Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Neutralite avidin was diluted in PBS supplemented with 40 mm bicarbonate, pH 9.0, and immediately adsorbed onto a polystyrene plate for 15 h at 4 °C, then washed five times with PBS, and blocked with PBS supplemented with 2% HSA for 2 h at 4 °C. The PSGL-1-derived peptides monobiotinylated in their C′ termini, were each diluted in cell binding medium (see below) and adsorbed for 4 h on the avidin-coated plate. For cell inhibition studies, selectin transfectants were incubated in H/H medium (Hank's balanced salt solution/10 mm HEPES, pH = 7.4, supplemented with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in the presence of 10 μg/ml of the L-selectin-blocking mAb, DREG-200, 50 μg/ml fucoidin, or 5 mm EGTA. To induce L-selectin dimerization, cells (2 × 106/ml) were preincubated for 15 min at 25 °C in cell binding medium (H/H medium supplemented with 2 mmCa2+) containing 10 μg/ml of either the L-selectin-dimerizing mAb, LAM1–118, or the control mAb, LAM1–101 (27Steeber D.A. Engel P. Miller A.S. Sheetz M.P. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 952-963PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were perfused unwashed over the test substrates. These conditions were found to induce optimal L-selectin dimerization on various ligand systems; further cross-linking of the dimerizing mAb had no additional augmenting effects (data not shown). The polystyrene plate, on which purified ligand was adsorbed, was assembled in a parallel plate laminar flow chamber (260-μm gap) as previously described (15Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Dwir O. Shimron F. Chen C. Singer M. Rosen S.D. Alon R. Cell. Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 349-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were washed in H/H medium at 107 cells/ml, resuspended in binding medium at 2 × 106 cells/ml, and perfused at room temperature through the flow chamber at desired flow rates, generated using an automated syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Natick, MA). Cellular interactions were visualized at two different fields of view (each 0.17 mm2 in area) using the 10× objective of an inverted phase contrast microscope (Diaphot 300, Nikon Inc.). Cell images were videotaped as previously described (15Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Dwir O. Shimron F. Chen C. Singer M. Rosen S.D. Alon R. Cell. Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 349-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When not otherwise indicated, cell images were manually quantitated by analysis of images directly from the monitor screen. Two types of initial cell tethering to the substrate were determined: transient tethers, in which cells attached briefly to the substrate without initiating rolling motions, or stable tethers, in which tethered cells established rolling on the substrate for at least 3 s after initial tethering. The number of either transient or rolling-associated tethers was divided by the flux of freely flowing cells moving through the same field (15Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cell accumulation assays were performed on cells allowed to settle onto the substrate for 30 s. The wall shear stress was then increased stepwise every 5 s. The number of cells accumulated at the end of each 5 s interval of increased shear and their rolling velocities were determined by computerized image analysis (see below). The imaging system developed for quantitative analysis of instantaneous velocities of cell movement, WSCAN-Array-3 (Galai, Migdal-Ha'emek, Israel), was described elsewhere (15Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In summary, individual transfectants rolling on a PSGL-1 coated substrate were tracked during their movement through the field of view for 3 s at 0.02 s resolution, and the mean displacement velocities of total cells were derived. Two categories of cells were identified based on their mean velocity above or below a critical velocity value: cells moving at a mean velocity <0.25 that of the hydrodynamic velocity (i.e. of freely moving cells) but above a defined velocity threshold were referred to as jerkily rolling cells; cells moving below the velocity threshold were defined as smoothly rolling cells. Microkinetics of individual cells exhibiting jerky rolling was analyzed on video segments recorded with a high speed camera (500 frames/sec; Kodak Motion Corder Analyzer, FASTCAM-SUPER 500, Eastman Kodak Co.). Cell position analysis was preformed at 0.002-s intervals with the WSCAN-Array-3 software as described (16Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At a shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2, specific pauses were defined as cell displacements of <0.6 μm during a period of 0.006 s separated by cell displacements of at least 3 μm during 0.004-s periods before and after each pause. The number of L-selectin-specific pauses per jerky rolling cell was derived, and the mean number of pauses per cell was calculated for cell populations of at least 45 cells. The natural log of the number of pauses with a given duration after pause initiation was plotted against pause duration (16Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A first-order dissociation plot yielded a straight line with the slope = −koff. To dimerize L-selectin while retaining its native cytoskeletal associations, dimerization of L-selectin was induced by ligation of a site on the SCR remote from the ligand recognition site (17Li X. Steeber D.A. Tang M.L.K. Farrar M.A. Perlmutter R.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using the L-selectin-dimerizing mAb, LAM-1–118. This mAb was recently shown to augment L-selectin-mediated rolling to a similar degree as that induced by cytoplasmic tail-mediated dimerization (17Li X. Steeber D.A. Tang M.L.K. Farrar M.A. Perlmutter R.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated the augmented adhesiveness of mAb-dimerized L-selectin toward endothelial surfaces expressing L-selectin ligands (17Li X. Steeber D.A. Tang M.L.K. Farrar M.A. Perlmutter R.M. Tedder T.F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore first characterized the effect of L-selectin dimerization on L-selectin adhesiveness to a purified PSGL-1 homodimer. Consistent with the previous study, artificial L-selectin dimerization by the dimerizing mAb augmented L-selectin-dependent capture and rolling of L-selectin transfected 300.19 pre-B cells on purified high density PSGL-1 under optimal dimerizing conditions (Fig.1A), whereas a non-dimerizing control L-selectin-specific mAb did not augment capture or rolling (Fig. 1A). Cross-linking of the dimerizing mAb with a secondary antibody did not further enhance L-selectin adhesiveness over that induced by optimal levels of dimerizing mAb (data not shown). Similar to pre-B cells, L-selectin expressed on other types of leukocytes, including human neutrophils, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and the T cell line Jurkat, also responded to the dimerizing mAb by a similar augmentation of capture and rolling on PSGL-1 as well as on other ligands including GlyCAM-1 and PNAd (data not shown). Dissection of the augmenting effects of the dimerizing mAb revealed that both the ability of L-selectin-expressing cells to initiate tethers to high density PSGL-1 (110 sites/μm2) and the conversion of these initial tethers into subsequent rolling were enhanced by L-selectin dimerization (Fig. 1, A and B). L-selectin dimerization also significantly increased the number of cells accumulated on a PSGL-1-coated substrate and the smoothness of their rolling, concomitantly with a reduction in mean rolling velocities (Fig. 1C). In contrast, L-selectin dimerization did not reduce the shear threshold required for lymphocytes to initiate L-selectin-mediated rolling on PSGL-1 (Fig. 1, B and C). Below 0.75 dyn/cm2 neither control mAb-treated transfectants nor cells treated with the dimerizing mAb could roll on PSGL-1, although they could still transiently tether to the ligand (Fig. 1C, inset). An EGF domain mutant of L-selectin, termed LPL, derived by a substitution of the L-selectin EGF domain with the homologous domain from P-selectin, although not altering the overall length of the mutated L-selectin, has been recently demonstrated by us to exhibit enhanced recognition of immobilized ligands under shear flow, even in a cell-free state (15Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Remarkably, LPL expressed on 300.19 pre-B cells exhibited far superior rolling activity versus that of dimerized L-selectin (Fig. 1C). The LPL-transfected pre-B cells exhibited much higher resistance to detachment by elevated shear stresses than dimerized L-selectin and dramatically reduced rolling velocities compared with cells treated with the L-selectin dimerizing mAb (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, although L-selectin dimerization did not reduce the threshold shear for rolling, the EGF domain substitution lowered that shear threshold (Fig. 1C and inset). These results indicate that the EGF domain mutation of L-selectin induces more robust augmentation of cell capture and rolling than L-selectin dimerization. The data also suggest that the dependence of the selectin adhesion on a shear stress threshold is not altered by its dimerization state but, rather, by alteration of intrinsic kinetic properties of selectin binding to immobilized ligand (15Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). L-selectin dimerization is expected to augment avidity only to properly clustered ligand. Indeed, dimerization of L-selectin increased rates of cell capture and the extent of initial tethering followed by rolling on high densities of L-selectin ligands more than on low densities of coated ligands (Fig.2A). Given that PSGL-1 is dimeric and that GlyCAM-1 is decorated with multiple L-selectin-binding carbohydrates (11Nicholson M.W. Barclay A.N. Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), dimerization of L-selectin on the leukocyte surface should augment its avidity to these ligands at any site density if individual ligand moieties on these scaffolds are properly spaced. However, below a critical value of coating density, the augmented tethering induced by dimerization was abrogated on both PSGL-1 and on GlyCAM-1 (Fig. 2A). Similar dependence of dimerization-enhanced L-selectin avidity on critical site density and proper spacing of ligand was also observed with a PSGL-1-derived glycopeptide corresponding to the first 19 residues of PSGL-1, which contains the major P- and L-selectin recognition sequences of native PSGL-1 (Fig. 2B). This suggests that only above this density can the peptide, anchored to the substrate via avidin, form effectively spaced dimers recognized by mAb-dimerized L-selectin. Interestingly, the coating density below which L-selectin dimerization no longer augmented tether formation was significantly lower for GlyCAM-1 than for PSGL-1 (Fig. 2A). This suggested a higher proportion of properly spaced L-selectin-binding moieties on GlyCAM-1 than on PSGL-1 coated at similar protein scaffold densities. In support of this possibility, GlyCAM-1 mediated more frequent rolling than PSGL-1 (Fig.2A), and the velocities of rolling mediated by GlyCAM-1 were far lower than rolling mediated on equivalent site densities of PSGL-1 (data not shown). Thus, although multivalent, when coated at 1 and 5 sites/μm2 on the test substrates, L-selectin-binding moieties on the GlyCAM-1 and PSGL-1 scaffolds, respectively, could be spaced too far to form dimers that could be recognized by dimerized L-selectin on tethered lymphocytes. Consistent with this assumption, L-selectin dimerization augmented L-selectin-mediated B cell tethering to immobilized mAb directed against the lectin domain of the selectin only above a critical mAb coating density (Fig. 2C). Because the mAb binds L-selectin at much higher affinity than natural L-selectin glycoprotein (11Nicholson M.W. Barclay A.N. Singer M.S. Rosen S.D. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 763-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Dwir O. Kansas G.S. Alon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18682-18691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), these results indicate that L-selectin dimerization enhances"

Regulated translation of these factors by neurotrophins, particularly by the Trk class of neurotrophin receptors, would implicate them in differentiation, survival, and neuronal plasticity. In this study, we investigated the effect of nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation on the synthesis of eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2. We found that NGF stimulation causes a preferential synthesis of eEF1A-1 over eEF1A-2 in PC12 cells. We analyzed the co-sedimentation of eEF1A-1 mRNA with polyribosome fractions in sucrose gradients, and found that NGF stimulation enriched the presence of eEF1A-1 mRNA in polyribosomes, indicating that the translation of eEF1A-1 mRNA is regulated by NGF. Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY 294002), mammalian target of rapamycin (rapamycin), and the NGF receptor, TrkA (K-252a), but not of mitogen-activated protein kinase (PD 98059), prevented the recruitment of eEF1A-1 mRNA to polyribosomes. The mobilization of eEF1A-1 mRNA to polyribosomes was rapamycin-sensitive in both proliferating and differentiated PC12 cells, indicating the importance of this pathway during differentiation. Our data shows that after growth factor withdrawal, an NGF-signaling pathway stimulates eEF1A-1 mRNA translation in proliferating and differentiated PC12 cells.

Howe C.L. Mobley W.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1217-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). NGF signaling is mediated by the TrkA receptor in addition to the low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75 (19Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In PC12 cells, NGF activates the ribosomal S6 kinases (20Matsuda Y. Nakanishi N. Dickens G. Guroff G. J.

Proud C.G. Thomas A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5536-5541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), implying the involvement of TOP mRNA translation. Also, translational regulation of gene expression by NGF is implicated in the protein synthesis that is required for neuritogenesis (24Twiss J.L. Shooter E.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Twiss J.L. Smith D.S. Chang B. Shooter E.M. Neurobiol. Dis. 2000; 7: 416-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that both eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2 are expressed in PC12 cells, and that the eEF1A-1 isoform is preferentially synthesized in response to NGF. We characterized the preferential synthesis of eEF1A-1, and we show that NGF regulates the translation of eEF1A-1 mRNA by its shifting to polyribosomes, as indicated by sucrose gradient sedimentation assays. PC12 cells were maintained on collagen-coated Petri dishes (1.5 μg/cm2; rat tail type VII, Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (ICN Biochemicals, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) supplemented with antibiotics (ICN) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Wisent Inc., St. Bruno, Quebec, Canada). Cells were subcultured by treatment with 0.1% trypsin/1 mm EDTA and reseeded at 1:3 or 1:4 dilutions every 6 days. For differentiation, 1.5 × 106 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes for 24 h, then switched to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and NGF (2.5 S; 100 ng/ml) (Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington, ON)), and changed every 48 h. After 6 days, the cells were switched to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with NGF (100 ng/ml), and replaced every 24 h. PC12 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted by centrifugation for 20 s at 10 000 × g, and stored at −80 °C. Pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, aprotinin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), and pepstatin (1 μg/ml) (inhibitors were from Roche (Laval, PQ, Canada)), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) (ICN). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was used as the cell extract. Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay detection kit (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Extracts were diluted no more than 2-fold with SDS-PAGE loading buffer (1 m Tris-HCl, (pH 6.8), 10% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol), heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to PROTRAN nitrocellulose (Xymotech Biosystems, Mount Royal, PQ, Canada) and blocked in 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline/0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were used according to the manufacturer's conditions or as previously described (11Khalyfa A. Bourbeau D. Chen E. Petroulakis E. Pan J., Xu, S. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22915-22922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies (CAPPEL) for 1 h and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) after exposure to Kodak X-OMAT-AR film. Monoclonal antibodies specific for neurofilament 68 and 200 kDa were from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-actin and anti-eEF1A were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Polyclonal antibodies specific for p42/p44 MAP kinase, phospho-p42/p44 MAP kinase, p70 S6K (S6K1), phospho-p70 S6K (phospho-S6K1), ribosomal protein S6, phospho-S6 (Ser-235/-236), phospho-S6 (Ser-240/-244) were from New England Biolabs Ltd. (Mississauga, ON, Canada). To analyze NGF-induced protein phosphorylation by Western blot analysis using phosphospecific antibodies, cell extracts were prepared using the manufacturer's recommendations. PC12 cells (2 × 106) were seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes for 48 h. To withdraw growth factors, cells were washed once and incubated for 3 h in serum-free medium. To deplete intracellular methionine, cells were washed once and incubated for 1 h in methionine-free medium. Fresh methionine-free medium (1.5 ml) containing [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was then added for 10 min before stimulation with NGF (100 ng/ml) (Invitrogen) or dialyzed fetal bovine serum (10%) (Invitrogen). LY 294002 (20 μm), PD 98059 (50 μm), and K-252a (200 nm) were purchased from Calbiochem. Rapamycin (100 ng/ml) was purchased from Sigma. Inhibitor stock solutions were prepared at 1000-fold dilutions in dimethyl sulfoxide, Me2SO); control cultures were treated only with Me2SO. Inhibitors were included during the methionine-depletion and [35S]methionine-labeling steps. To immunoprecipitate eEF1A-1/eEF1A-2, extracts were prepared (as described above), diluted to equal concentrations (1–5 μg/μl), and precleared with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose, Fast Flow (AmershamBiosciences) for 1 h, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-eEF1A antibody (1:100 dilution). Immune complexes were collected on 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 3 h and then washed three times (10 min each) with 1 ml of 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.6), 600 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% IGEPAL CA-630. The protein G-Sepharose was finally resuspended in SDS-PAGE buffer and heated at 95–100 °C for 10 min, and an aliquot was subjected to PAGE with some modifications (28Doucet J.P. Trifaro J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 29Doucet J.P. Murphy B.J. Tuana B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Essentially, gels (1.5 mm thickness) consisted of a 4% stacking gel (70 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS, 5% glycerol), and a 20-cm separating gel (100 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mmglycine, 0.4% SDS, 5% glycerol). Proteins were separated for 13 h at 20 mA. Gels were fixed, dried under vacuum, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen or to Kodak X-OMAT AR film at −80 °C. In the latter case, gels were treated with Amplify Fluorographic Reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Protein band intensities were quantified using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Approximately 5 × 106 cells, grown in 100-mm dishes, were treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing cycloheximide (100 μg/ml), harvested in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min at 6000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was resuspended and incubated for 10 min in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 120 units/ml RNAGuard (Amersham Biosciences). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and 800 μl of the supernatant was applied to a 11.5-ml sucrose gradient (12–45%) (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 15 units/ml RNAGuard). Gradients were subjected to centrifugation at 38,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW40Ti rotor, fractionated from the top (1.3 ml/min) using an auto densi-flow density gradient fractionator (Labconco), and pumped through a flowcell cuvette (Beckman). The absorbance at 260 nm was recorded every 3 s using a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer. Fifteen fractions (800–850 μl each) were collected, and 300 μl of each were treated with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) (Roche) and 0.2% SDS for 60 min at 56 °C. RNA was extracted with an equal volume of water-saturated phenol:chloroform (1:1) (Invitrogen) and precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 95% ethanol in the presence of yeast tRNA (30 μg) (Roche). The RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, washed once with 70% ethanol and centrifuged again. RNA was dissolved in loading buffer (30Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar), fractionated in a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel (30Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar), transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and cross-linked by UV irradiation using a GS gene linker (BioRad). cDNA fragments of β-actin and the 3′-UTR of eEF1A-1 mRNAs were generated by PCR (14Chambers D.M. Peters J. Abbott C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4463-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and used to produce [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)-labeled probes using a random primer labeling kit (Roche). Membranes were prehybridized for 2 h at 68 °C in ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) containing herring sperm DNA (250 μg/ml) (Roche). The denatured probe was added and incubated for 14 h at 68 °C. Membranes were washed for 40 min at room temperature in 2× SSC (sodium-saline-citrate)/0.1% SDS with one change after 20 min. Membranes were finally washed three times (15 min each) at 60 °C in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. Band intensities were determined using ImageQuant. Growth factor stimulation induces protein synthesis and a specific activation of eEF1A-1 translation (31Jefferies H.B. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4367-4372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2 proteins are already expressed at high levels in PC12 cells and because their predicted molecular masses differ by only 0.5 kDa, we used modified SDS-PAGE procedures to detect quantifiable changes in expression. First, we have previously used eEF1A-1- and eEF1A-2-specific antibodies to demonstrate that the pan-eEF1A-specific monoclonal antibody used in this study recognizes both isoforms (11Khalyfa A. Bourbeau D. Chen E. Petroulakis E. Pan J., Xu, S. Wang E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22915-22922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Secondly, immunoprecipitation assays were conducted using extracts from [35S]methionine-labeled PC12 cells, allowing us to accurately quantify the levels of eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2 protein expression. We quantified the eEF1A-1/eEF1A-2 ratio, and we used this ratio as a specific indicator of the relative level of eEF1A-1 synthesis. Thirdly, we achieved a highly resolved separation of immunoprecipitated [35S]methionine-labeled eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2 using a modified SDS-PAGE system (see “Materials and Methods”). To determine the effect of NGF stimulation on the synthesis of eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2, non-differentiated PC12 cells were subjected to serum deprivation for 3 h and then exposed to NGF (100 ng/ml) for 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min in the presence of [35S]methionine. Newly synthesized,35S-labeled eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2 proteins at each time point were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using the pan-eEF1A-specific antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). In untreated PC12 cells, eEF1A-2 protein was found to be the prominent isoform at each time point in growth factor-free conditions (untreated, Fig. 1 A). In NGF-treated PC12 cells, the overall rate of eEF1A-2 synthesis was slightly increased as judged by the immunoprecipitated levels of protein. In comparison, there was an abundance of eEF1A-1 detected after 120 and 180 min of NGF stimulation (Fig. 1 A). By comparing the levels of eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2 proteins after 60, 120, and 180 min, eEF1A-1 was preferentially synthesized after NGF stimulation (Fig. 1 A). To demonstrate the distinction between cells that express eEF1A-2 and those that express only eEF1A-1, we also labeled non-differentiated P19 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells that express only the eEF1A-1 isoform. Only a single band corresponding to eEF1A-1 was detected in P19 cells, and a doublet of eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2 was detected in PC12 cell extracts (Figs. 1 A, lanes 14 and 15). No additional bands were detected when immunoprecipitations were conducted in the absence of antibody (-ab, Fig. 1 A, lane 13). In parallel experiments, we verified that NGF signaling was sustained during stimulation with NGF for 3 h. Phosphorylated p42/p44 MAP kinase was detected within 5 min of NGF exposure (Fig. 1 B). A maximum level of phosphorylated p44/p42 was maintained for 60 min and was still detectable after 180 min. We could not detect phosphorylated p44/p42 MAPK in untreated cells. Similarly, the maximum levels of phosphorylated S6K1 and S6 were detected after 15 min of NGF exposure (Fig. 1 B). Phosphorylation of S6 was maintained at its maximum level during NGF treatment. Therefore, the expected signaling pathways were activated and sustained by exposure to NGF (reviewed in Ref. 18Sofroniew M.V. Howe C.L. Mobley W.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1217-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Mitogen-induced synthesis of eEF1A-1 is mediated by through PI3K and mTOR (3Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 32Pedersen S. Celis J.E. Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Nielsen F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We quantified the effect of NGF stimulation on the eEF1A-1/eEF1A-2 ratio and determined the signaling pathways involved in altering the eEF1A-1/eEF1A-2 ratio by using pharmacological inhibitors. In the absence of growth factors, the amount of incorporated [35S]methionine was ∼2.5 times more [35S]methionine was incorporated in eEF1A-2 than eEF1A-1 in PC12 cells as indicated by the immunoprecipitated levels (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Consistent with the result of Fig. 1 A, there was a specific increase in the level of eEF1A-1 in NGF-stimulated cells resulting in a statistically significant increase (1.62 ± 0.18-fold;p < 0.001) in the eEF1A-1/eEF1A-2 ratio (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). A similar effect was observed in serum-stimulated PC12 cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). Again, we used P19 control cell extracts that contain only eEF1A-1 in order to distinguish its mobility from eEF1A-2 that is also present in PC12 cells (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 8 and 9). Again, no additional bands were detected when immunoprecipitations were conducted in the absence of antibody (-ab) (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 7). These results show that serum deprivation causes a specific decrease, while NGF stimulation induced a specific increase in eEF1A-1 synthesis. To determine the signaling pathways involved in NGF-mediated increases in the eEF1A-1/eEF1A-2 ratio by NGF, PC12 cells were pretreated with PI3K inhibitor (LY 294002), the mTOR inhibitor (rapamycin), or K-252a, an inhibitor of the high affinity NGF-receptor (TrkA). The MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD 98059, was used in order to assess the involvement of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Pretreatment with LY 294002 completely inhibited the increase of the eEF1A-1/eEF1A-2 ratio in NGF and serum-stimulated PC12 cells (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 3). Rapamycin also inhibited the increase of eEF1A-1, although there was a small inhibitory effect on eEF1A-2 synthesis that resulted in a slight increase of the eEF1A-1/eEF1A-2 ratio in NGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 2, A and B, lane 4). In comparison, PD 980509 had relatively no effect on the eEF1A-1/eEF1A-2 ratio after NGF stimulation, although the up-regulation of eEF1A-1 synthesis by NGF was partly inhibited (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). We verified that this was due to the effect of PD98059 alone (data not shown). Pretreatment with K-252a prevented the increase of eEF1A-1/eEF1A-2 only in NGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). Based on the inhibitory effects of LY 294002, rapamycin, and K-252a, we concluded that NGF stimulation caused a preferential increase in eEF1A-1 synthesis that is mediated by PI3K, mTOR, and through the TrkA receptor, respectively. To verify the specificity of the inhibitors, the phosphorylation status of p44/p42 MAPK, S6K1, and S6 was determined in parallel experiments (Fig. 2 C). In NGF-treated cells the maximum level of phosphorylated MAPK, S6K1, and S6 at serine 235/236 was detected after 30 min. In PD 98059-pretreated cells, the phosphorylation of MAPK by NGF, but not that of S6K1 or S6, was inhibited. Pretreatment with LY294002 or rapamycin prevented maximum phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6. However, very low levels of hypo-phosphorylated S6K1 and S6 were present in our preparations. Pretreatment with K-252a resulted in complete inhibition of MAPK, S6K1, and S6 phosphorylation. The total amount of MAPK, S6K1, and S6 was similar in all samples, as judged by analyzing the total level of each protein (Fig. 2 C). These results indicated that the intended signaling pathways were inhibited. NGF stimulation increases the rate of protein synthesis in PC12 cells (23Kleijn M. Welsh G.I. Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Proud C.G. Thomas A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5536-5541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that this increase is associated with an increase in polyribosome assembly, we prepared polyribosome profiles by sucrose gradient centrifugation from serum-deprived, NGF-stimulated, and serum-stimulated PC12 cells. In serum-deprived PC12 cells, we observed distinct 40 S, 60 S, and 80 S ribosome peaks in fractions 4, 6, and 8, respectively (Fig. 3 A). In NGF-stimulated PC12 cells, these peaks disappeared as a result of shifting to polyribosome fractions (12Ann D.K. Moutsatsos I.K. Nakamura T. Lin H.H. Mao P.L. Lee M.J. Chin S. Liem R.K. Wang E. J.

The regulation is thought to be mediated, at least in part, by regulatory proteins that are encoded by the nuclear genome and targeted to the chloroplast where they interact with chloroplast mRNAs. Previous studies identified high affinity binding of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of the chloroplast psbA mRNA by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii proteins. Here we tested whether the 3′-UTR of psbA mRNA alone or linked in cis with the 5′-UTR of the mRNA affects the high affinity binding of the message in vitro. We did not detect high affinity binding that is unique to the 3′-UTR. However, we show that the cis-linked 3′-UTR increases the stability of the 5′-UTR binding complex.

In support of this notion, recent results have shown that correct processing of the 3′-UTR can promote translation initiation and polysomal association (24Rott R. Levy H. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4605-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Expression of the D1 protein, encoded by the chloroplast psbA mRNA, is a prime example of the regulation of translation involving the interaction of nuclear encoded factors and regions of inverted repeats in the 5′-UTR of the transcript (3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 6Hirose T. Sugiura M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,25Eibl C. Zou Z.

In C. reinhardtii, the 5′-UTR of psbA mRNA is the target for the light-regulated binding of a complex of proteins of 38, 47, 55, and 60 kDa (3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These proteins interact with an inverted repeat that is located upstream from a potential Shine-Dalgarno-like site in the 5′-UTR (3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Mayfield S.P. Cohen A. Danon A. Yohn C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and possibly with a second site after psbA mRNA undergoes 5′-processing (28Bruick R.K. Mayfield S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Assays of D1 synthesis in C. reinhardtii mutants, in which the inverted repeat has been partially deleted or mutated, indicate the importance of the stem-loop fold for the light-responsive increase of D1 synthesis (7Mayfield S.P. Cohen A. Danon A. Yohn C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The central RNA-binding protein in the psbA 5′-binding complex is the 47-kDa protein (RB47). RB47 is a nuclear encoded protein that shows high homology to poly(A)-binding proteins (29Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3560-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mutants in which RB47 expression is low or lacking are defective in D1 translation, implicating RB47 as a message-specific translational factor (29Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3560-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Rosch C. Kuchka M.R. Mayfield S.P. J.

A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The 60-kDa protein (RB60) is a protein-disulfide isomerase-like protein also encoded by the nuclear genome (32Kim J. Mayfield S.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1954-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). RB60 has been identified as the regulatory redox-active protein of the psbA 5′-binding complex and is the likely candidate for perceiving the light-signal and modulating the binding of the complex (33Trebitsh T. Levitan A. Sofer A. Danon A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1116-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).In addressing the potential modes of regulation of psbA expression, we examined whether the 3′-UTR affects protein binding to psbA mRNA. We report here a comparison of binding of C. reinhardtii proteins to RNA probes of 5′-UTR, 3′-UTR, and cis-linked 5′-UTR-3′-UTR. Our analysis indicated that the high affinity binding to psbA mRNA is primarily via its 5′-UTR, whereas the presence of 3′-UTR in cis increases the affinity of binding of the 5′-UTR-binding protein complex.DISCUSSIONHere we show that the presence in cis of the 3′-UTR of psbA mRNA is required for high affinity binding of the native complex, containing the RB47 protein, to the 5′-UTR. Several modes of action could explain the effect of the 3′-UTR on the binding of the proteins to the 5′-UTR of psbA mRNA. A change in the affinity of an RNA-protein complex may result from a conformational shift in the RNA and/or from an altered binding of the protein. Our results, so far, do not exclude either possibility. The 3′-UTR of psbA mRNA may interact directly with the 5′-UTR of the message, thereby inducing it to form a structural motif with high affinity to the native complex containing RB47. Such long range RNA-RNA interactions have been found to affect translational efficiency in prokaryotes (22Lindahl L. Hinnebusch A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the MFOLD computer program for RNA structure analysis (36Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar) did not predict any such 5′-UTR-3′-UTR interactions (data not shown). Alternatively, because low affinity binding of RB47 to the 3′-UTR was also found (Fig. 3), it is possible that RB47 may bind both UTRs of psbA mRNA when they are present in cis. This may not be entirely surprising as the 3′-UTR is AU-rich, and RB47 shares high homology with poly(A)-binding proteins (31Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this scheme, the simultaneous binding of RB47 and its associated proteins to the 5′- and 3′-UTRs forms a high affinity complex (Fig. 2).Previous characterization of the 5′-UTR binding activity by GMS, UVCL, and psbA RNA-affinity chromatography assays suggested that it is composed of four proteins (3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The UVCL assay, which labels proteins that are in direct contact with the RNA, showed that RB47 is the primary RNA-binding protein of the complex (Fig. 3 and Ref. 3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and cloning of RB47 showed that it contains RNA-binding domains (31Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Extraction of the proteins that were complexed with the 5′-UTR of psbA mRNA in the GMS assay revealed that RB60 is also associated with the RNA, potentially via protein-protein interactions with RB47 (3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it was suggested that the complex contains four proteins of which only binding of RB47 and RB60 was resistant to the conditions of the GMS (3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).A comparison of mobility shift of 5′-T and 5′3′-T RNAs by either rRB47 or by the partially purified C. reinhardtii proteins showed that the native proteins form complexes with slower mobility (Fig. 6), further indicating that the native complex contains additional protein(s), such as RB60, RB38, or RB55. The higher affinity of the binding of the native complex to the cis-linked 5′- and 3′-UTRs than to the 5′-T transcript indicates that the presence in cis of the 3′-UTR promotes the binding of the native complex comprised of RB47 and its cognate proteins. Interestingly, the recombinant RB47 binds the 5′-T and the 5′3′-T at similar high affinities (compare Figs. 5 and 6), suggesting that the lower affinity of the native complex in the absence of the 3′-UTR is a result of action of the proteins associated with RB47.The activity of the proteins that bind the 5′-UTR psbA mRNA correlates with the translation rate of the D1 protein in C. reinhardtii cells (3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increased affinity of 5′-UTR psbA mRNA-binding proteins conferred by the 3′-UTR may suggest that the 3′-UTR influences D1 synthesis by stimulating binding of the native complex, comprised of RB47 and its cognate proteins, to the 5′-UTR. Correct processing of the 3′-UTR was suggested to be required for high levels of translation initiation and polysomal association in C. reinhardtii cells (24Rott R. Levy H. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4605-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recent results from tobacco transformants in which the influence of the psbA UTRs on translation of a reporter gene were studied indicated that including the psbA 3′-UTR resulted in a 3–4-fold enhancement of translation (25Eibl C. Zou Z. Beck A. Kim M. Mullet J. Koop H.-U. Plant J. 1999; 19: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In another study, deletion of the inverted repeat of the 3′-UTR of petD mRNA led to a reduction in petD expression beyond that expected by the decrease in mRNA accumulation alone, indicating that the 3′-UTR may also contribute to efficient translation (37Monde R.A. Greene J.C. Stern D.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the 3′-UTR of chloroplast messages is required for optimal translation, in addition to its role in determination of mRNA stability. Collectively, these results suggest that the impaired binding of the native complex, comprised of RB47 and its associated proteins, to a psbA mRNA lacking an intact 3′-UTR may discriminate it from efficient translation. In initiation of translation, ribosomes bind to the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) 1The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionGMSgel mobility shiftUVCLUV-cross-linkingrrecombinant 1The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionGMSgel mobility shiftUVCLUV-cross-linkingrrecombinant of the mRNA and are consequently directed to the initiator codon of the open reading frame. The 5′-UTR of several chloroplast mRNAs in higher plants and in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contain regions of inverted repeats and binding sites for nuclear encoded proteins. These interactions have been shown to be involved not only in regulation of translation but also in processing and stability of the message (1Alexander C. Faber N. Klaff P.

Greene J.C. Stern D.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the 3′-UTR of chloroplast messages is required for optimal translation, in addition to its role in determination of mRNA stability. Collectively, these results suggest that the impaired binding of the native complex, comprised of RB47 and its associated proteins, to a psbA mRNA lacking an intact 3′-UTR may discriminate it from efficient translation. Here we show that the presence in cis of the 3′-UTR of psbA mRNA is required for high affinity binding of the native complex, containing the RB47 protein, to the 5′-UTR. Several modes of action could explain the effect of the 3′-UTR on the binding of the proteins to the 5′-UTR of psbA mRNA. A change in the affinity of an RNA-protein complex may result from a conformational shift in the RNA and/or from an altered binding of the protein. Our results, so far, do not exclude either possibility. The 3′-UTR of psbA mRNA may interact directly with the 5′-UTR of the message, thereby inducing it to form a structural motif with high affinity to the native complex containing RB47. Such long range RNA-RNA interactions have been found to affect translational efficiency in prokaryotes (22Lindahl L. Hinnebusch A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the MFOLD computer program for RNA structure analysis (36Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar) did not predict any such 5′-UTR-3′-UTR interactions (data not shown). Alternatively, because low affinity binding of RB47 to the 3′-UTR was also found (Fig. 3), it is possible that RB47 may bind both UTRs of psbA mRNA when they are present in cis. This may not be entirely surprising as the 3′-UTR is AU-rich, and RB47 shares high homology with poly(A)-binding proteins (31Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this scheme, the simultaneous binding of RB47 and its associated proteins to the 5′- and 3′-UTRs forms a high affinity complex (Fig. 2). Previous characterization of the 5′-UTR binding activity by GMS, UVCL, and psbA RNA-affinity chromatography assays suggested that it is composed of four proteins (3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The UVCL assay, which labels proteins that are in direct contact with the RNA, showed that RB47 is the primary RNA-binding protein of the complex (Fig. 3 and Ref. 3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and cloning of RB47 showed that it contains RNA-binding domains (31Yohn C.B. Cohen A. Danon A. Mayfield S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Extraction of the proteins that were complexed with the 5′-UTR of psbA mRNA in the GMS assay revealed that RB60 is also associated with the RNA, potentially via protein-protein interactions with RB47 (3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it was suggested that the complex contains four proteins of which only binding of RB47 and RB60 was resistant to the conditions of the GMS (3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A comparison of mobility shift of 5′-T and 5′3′-T RNAs by either rRB47 or by the partially purified C. reinhardtii proteins showed that the native proteins form complexes with slower mobility (Fig. 6), further indicating that the native complex contains additional protein(s), such as RB60, RB38, or RB55. The higher affinity of the binding of the native complex to the cis-linked 5′- and 3′-UTRs than to the 5′-T transcript indicates that the presence in cis of the 3′-UTR promotes the binding of the native complex comprised of RB47 and its cognate proteins. Interestingly, the recombinant RB47 binds the 5′-T and the 5′3′-T at similar high affinities (compare Figs. 5 and 6), suggesting that the lower affinity of the native complex in the absence of the 3′-UTR is a result of action of the proteins associated with RB47. The activity of the proteins that bind the 5′-UTR psbA mRNA correlates with the translation rate of the D1 protein in C. reinhardtii cells (3Danon A. Mayfield S.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3993-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Therefore, the increased affinity of 5′-UTR psbA mRNA-binding proteins conferred by the 3′-UTR may suggest that the 3′-UTR influences D1 synthesis by stimulating binding of the native complex, comprised of RB47 and its cognate proteins, to the 5′-UTR. Correct processing of the 3′-UTR was suggested to be required for high levels of translation initiation and polysomal association in C. reinhardtii cells (24Rott R. Levy H. Drager R.G. Stern D.B. Schuster G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4605-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recent results from tobacco transformants in which the influence of the psbA UTRs on translation of a reporter gene were studied indicated that including the psbA 3′-UTR resulted in a 3–4-fold enhancement of translation (25Eibl C. Zou Z. Beck A. Kim M. Mullet J. Koop H.-U. Plant J. 1999; 19: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In another study, deletion of the inverted repeat of the 3′-UTR of petD mRNA led to a reduction in petD expression beyond that expected by the decrease in mRNA accumulation alone, indicating that the 3′-UTR may also contribute to efficient translation (37Monde R.A.
