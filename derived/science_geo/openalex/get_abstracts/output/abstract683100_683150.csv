https://openalex.org/W3205683342,"Lead halide perovskite (LHP) semiconductors show exceptional optoelectronic properties. Barriers for their applications, however, lie in their polymorphism, instability to polar solvents, phase segregation, and susceptibility to the leaching of lead ions. We report a family of scalable composites fabricated through liquid-phase sintering of LHPs and metal-organic framework glasses. The glass acts as a matrix for LHPs, effectively stabilizing nonequilibrium perovskite phases through interfacial interactions. These interactions also passivate LHP surface defects and impart bright, narrow-band photoluminescence with a wide gamut for creating white light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The processable composites show high stability against immersion in water and organic solvents as well as exposure to heat, light, air, and ambient humidity. These properties, together with their lead self-sequestration capability, can enable breakthrough applications for LHPs."

Understanding this process, known as quantum scrambling, is key to resolving several open questions in physics. Here, by measuring the time-dependent evolution and fluctuation of out-of-time-order correlators, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of quantum scrambling on a 53-qubit quantum processor. We engineer quantum circuits that distinguish operator spreading and operator entanglement and experimentally observe their respective signatures. We show that whereas operator spreading is captured by an efficient classical model, operator entanglement in idealized circuits requires exponentially scaled computational resources to simulate. These results open the path to studying complex and practically relevant physical observables with near-term quantum processors."

These fragile headwaters are now experiencing amplified climate change, glacier melt, and permafrost thaw. Observational data from 28 headwater basins demonstrate substantial increases in both annual runoff and annual sediment fluxes across the past six decades. The increases are accelerating from the mid-1990s in response to a warmer and wetter climate. The total sediment flux from High Mountain Asia is projected to more than double by 2050 under an extreme climate change scenario. These findings have far-reaching implications for the region’s hydropower, food, and environmental security."

The introduction of reactive polar groups in these chains could help overcome problematic environmental persistence and enhance compatibility with other materials. We show that phosphinophenolate-coordinated nickel complexes can catalyze nonalternating copolymerization of ethylene with carbon monoxide to incorporate a low density of individual in-chain keto groups in polyethylene chains with high molecular weight while retaining desirable material properties. After processing by conventional injection molding techniques, tensile properties remain on par with those of standard high-density polyethylene while also imparting photodegradability."
https://openalex.org/W3210550082,"Electrical switching of a metal-to-insulator transition would provide a building block for integrated electro-optically active plasmonics. In this work, we realize plasmonic nanoantennas from metallic polymers, which show well-pronounced localized plasmon resonances in their metallic state. As a result of the electrochemically driven optical metal-to-insulator transition of the polymer, the plasmonic resonances can be electrically switched fully off and back on at video-rate frequencies of up to 30 hertz by applying alternating voltages of only ±1 volt. With the use of this concept, we demonstrate electrically switchable beam-steering metasurfaces with a 100% contrast ratio in transmission. Our approach will help to realize ultrahigh efficiency plasmonic-based integrated active optical devices, including high-resolution augmented and virtual reality technologies."

Whilst previous studies have clarified these and several other aspects of COVID-19, one of the ongoing challenges regarding COVID-19 is to determine which patients are at risk of adverse outcomes of COVID-19 infection. It is hypothesized that this is the result of insufficient inhibition of the immune response, with the vagus nerve being an important neuro-immuno-modulator of inflammation. Vagus nerve activity can be non-invasively indexed by heart-rate-variability (HRV). Therefore, we aimed to assess the prognostic value of HRV, as a surrogate marker for vagus nerve activity, in predicting mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) referral, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.A retrospective cohort study including all consecutive patients (n = 271) diagnosed and hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 2020 and May 2020, without a history of cardiac arrhythmias (including atrial and ventricular premature contractions), pacemaker, or current bradycardia (heart rate <50 bpm) or tachycardia (heart rate >110 bpm). HRV was based on one 10s ECG recorded at admission. 3-week survival and ICU referral were examined.HRV indexed as standard deviation of normal to normal heartbeat intervals (SDNN) predicted survival (H.R. = 0.53 95%CI: 0.31-0.92). This protective role was observed only in patients aged 70 years and older, not in younger patients. HRV below median value also predicted ICU referral within the first week of hospitalization (H.R = 0.51, 95%CI: 0.29-0.90, P = 0.021).Higher HRV predicts greater chances of survival, especially in patients aged 70 years and older with COVID-19, independent of major prognostic factors. Low HRV predicts ICU indication and admission in the first week after hospitalization."

However, observing this segmented Fermi surface directly is tricky. To do so, Zhu et al . worked with a thin film of the topological insulator bismuth telluride placed on top of superconducting niobium diselenide. A small applied magnetic field caused a screening current, which in turn led to a segmented Fermi surface in the topological insulator layer. Using a scanning tunneling microscope, the researchers were able to map out this Fermi surface. —JS"

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. social distancing) are an important means through which to control the transmission of such viruses. One of the key factors determining the effectiveness of such measures is the level of public adherence to them. Research to date has focused on quantitative exploration of adherence and non-adherence, with a relative lack of qualitative exploration of the reasons for non-adherence.To explore participants' perceptions of non-adherence to COVID-19 policy measures by self and others in the UK, focusing on perceived reasons for non-adherence.Qualitative study comprising 12 focus groups conducted via video-conferencing between 25th September and 13th November 2020. Participants were 51 UK residents aged 18 and above, reflecting a range of ages, genders and race/ethnicities. Data were analysed using a thematic approach.Participants reported seeing an increase in non-adherence in others over the course of the pandemic. Reports of non-adherence in self were lower than reports of non-adherence in others. Analysis revealed six main themes related to participants' reported reasons for non-adherence in self and others: (1) 'Alert fatigue' (where people find it difficult to follow, or switch off from, information about frequently changing rules or advice) (2) Inconsistent rules (3) Lack of trust in government (4) Learned Helplessness (5) Resistance and rebelliousness (6)The impact of vaccines on risk perception. Participants perceived a number of systemic failures (e.g. unclear policy, untrustworthy policymakers) to strongly contribute to two forms non-adherence-violations and errors.Findings suggest that latent and systemic failures-in the form of policy decisions that are commonly experienced as too changeable, inconsistent and confusing, and policy makers that are commonly perceived as untrustworthy-may play a significant role in creating the conditions that enable or encourage non-adherence."

We leveraged a new dataset of Indigenous land dispossession and forced migration to statistically compare features of historical tribal lands to present-day tribal lands at the aggregate and individual tribe level. Results show a near-total aggregate reduction of Indigenous land density and spread. Indigenous peoples were forced to lands that are more exposed to climate change risks and hazards and are less likely to lie over valuable subsurface oil and gas resources. Agricultural suitability and federal land proximity results—which affect Indigenous movements, management, and traditional uses—are mixed. These findings have substantial policy implications related to heightened climate vulnerability, extensive land reduction, and diminished land value."

In this work, we use Tara Oceans metabarcoding data, which cover all major ocean basins, combined with a probabilistic model of taxon co-occurrence to compare the biogeography of 70 major groups of eukaryotic plankton. We uncover two main axes of biogeographic variation. First, more-diverse groups display clearer biogeographic patterns. Second, large-bodied consumers are structured by oceanic basins, mostly through the main current systems, whereas small-bodied phototrophs are structured by latitude and follow local environmental conditions. Our study highlights notable differences in biogeographies across plankton groups and investigates their determinants at the global scale."
https://openalex.org/W3211257033,"COVID-19 may present with a variety of clinical syndromes, however, the upper airway and the lower respiratory tract are the principle sites of infection. Previous work on respiratory viral infections demonstrated that airway inflammation results in the release of volatile organic compounds as well as nitric oxide. The detection of these gases from patients' exhaled breath offers a novel potential diagnostic target for COVID-19 that would offer real-time screening of patients for COVID-19 infection.We present here a breath tester utilizing a catalytically active material, which allows for the temporal manifestation of the gaseous biomarkers' interactions with the sensor, thus giving a distinct breath print of the disease. A total of 46 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients on mechanical ventilation participated in the study, 23 with active COVID-19 respiratory infection and 23 non-COVID-19 controls. Exhaled breath bags were collected on ICU days 1, 3, 7, and 10 or until liberation from mechanical ventilation. The breathalyzer detected high exhaled nitric oxide (NO) concentration with a distinctive pattern for patients with active COVID-19 pneumonia. The COVID-19 ""breath print"" has the pattern of the small Greek letter omega (). The ""breath print"" identified patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with 88% accuracy upon their admission to the ICU. Furthermore, the sensitivity index of the breath print (which scales with the concentration of the key biomarker ammonia) appears to correlate with duration of COVID-19 infection.The implication of this breath tester technology for the rapid screening for COVID-19 and potentially detection of other infectious diseases in the future."

How these features change with depth is unknown, with theories of their structure ranging from shallow meteorological features to surface expressions of deep-seated convection. We present observations of atmospheric vortices using the Juno spacecraft’s Microwave Radiometer. We found vortex roots that extend deeper than the altitude at which water is expected to condense, and we identified density inversion layers. Our results constrain the three-dimensional structure of Jupiter’s vortices and their extension below the clouds."

Nevertheless, such terms are highly subjective and present challenges to ascertain precisely what such research looks like. Accordingly, this article responds to the question: how do faculty from universities in the United States and Canada define the terms quality, prestige, and impact of academic journals? We address this question by surveying 338 faculty members from 55 different institutions in the U.S. and Canada. While relying on self-reported definitions that are not linked to their behavior, this study's findings highlight that faculty often describe these distinct terms in overlapping ways. Additionally, results show that marked variance in definitions across faculty does not correspond to demographic characteristics. This study's results highlight the subjectivity of common research terms and the importance of implementing evaluation regimes that do not rely on ill-defined concepts and may be context specific."

It has been unclear how deep the vortex extends beneath its visible cloud tops. We examined the gravity signature of the GRS using data from 12 encounters of the Juno spacecraft with the planet, including two direct overflights of the vortex. Localized density anomalies due to the presence of the GRS caused a shift in the spacecraft line-of-sight velocity. Using two different approaches to infer the GRS depth, which yielded consistent results, we conclude that the GRS is contained within the upper 500 kilometers of Jupiter’s atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W3208651593,"Excessive use of social network sites (SNSs) can often lead to negative consequences of frequent upward social comparisons despite having the social network platform to present users in a favorable light. However, the existing literature gives little evidence to social comparison related antecedents and consequents of uncontrollable use of SNSs. The present study aimed to investigate the contributions of social comparison to SNS addiction. In Study 1, using a convenient sample in Austria (n = 103), we showed that the tendency to engage in social comparisons of ability (but not of opinion) predicted self-reported SNS addiction over and above the feelings of relative deprivation on social support and status. SNS addiction mediated the relations between social comparison of ability and stress, but not self-esteem. In Study 2, using a broad sample of participants in Austria (n = 500), we replicated the findings observed in Study 1 and showed that contrastive upward social comparison emotions (i.e., envy, depression) mediated the relation between SNS addiction and lower self-esteem whereas the contrastive downward social comparison emotion (i.e., contentment) mediated the relation between SNS addiction and higher self-esteem. Our findings suggest that SNS addiction closely relates to psychological constructs relevant to social comparison, mediates the link between social comparison of ability and detrimental consequences (i.e., stress, well-being) and demonstrate how social comparison emotions relate to both positive and negative associations between SNS addiction and self-esteem."
https://openalex.org/W3209529261,"Background Despite the development and enforcement of preventive guidelines by governments, COVID-19 continues to spread across nations, causing unprecedented economic losses and mortality. Public places remain hotspots for COVID-19 transmission due to large numbers of people present; however preventive measures are poorly enforced. Supermarkets are among the high-risk establishments due to the high interactions involved, which makes compliance with the COVID-19 preventive guidelines of paramount importance. However, until now, there has been limited evidence on compliance with the set COVID-19 prevention guidelines. Therefore, this study aimed to measure compliance with the COVID-19 prevention guidelines among supermarkets in Kampala Capital City and Mukono Municipality Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among selected supermarkets in Kampala Capital City and Mukono Municipality in September 2020. A total of 229 supermarkets (195 in Kampala City and 34 in Mukono Municipality) were randomly selected for the study. Data were collected through structured observations on the status of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, and entered using the KoboCollect software, which was preinstalled on mobile devices (smart phones and tablets). Descriptive statistics were generated to measure compliance to the set COVID-19 Ministry of Health prevention guidelines using Stata 14 software. Results Only 16.6% (38/229) of the supermarkets complied with the COVID-19 prevention and control guidelines. In line with the specific measures, almost all supermarkets 95.2% (218/229) had hand washing facilities placed at strategic points such as the entrance, and 59.8% (137/229) of the supermarkets surveyed regularly disinfected commonly touched surfaces. Only 40.6% and 30.6% of the supermarkets enforced mandatory hand washing and use of face masks respectively for all customers accessing the premises. Slightly more than half, 52.4% (120/229) of the supermarkets had someone or a team in charge of enforcing compliance to COVID-19 measures and more than half, 55.5% (127/229) of the supermarkets had not provided their staff with job-specific training/mentorship on infection prevention and control for COVID-19. Less than a third, 26.2% (60/229) of the supermarkets had an infrared temperature gun for screening every customer, and only 5.7% (13/229) of the supermarkets captured details of clients accessing the supermarket as a measure to ease follow-up. Conclusion This study revealed low compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, which required mandatory preventive measures such as face masking, regular disinfection, social distancing, and hand hygiene. This study suggests the need for health authorities to strengthen enforcement of these guidelines, and to sensitise the supermarket managers on COVID-19 in order to increase the uptake of the different measures."

Understanding the impacts of wildfire throughout this ecotone is required to make predictions of the rate and magnitude of changes in boreal-tundra landcover, its future flammability, and associated feedbacks to the global carbon (C) cycle and climate. We studied 48 sites spanning a gradient from tundra to low-density spruce stands that were burned in an extensive 2013 wildfire on the north slope of the Alaska Range in Denali National Park and Preserve, central Alaska. We assessed wildfire severity and C emissions, and determined the impacts of severity on understory vegetation composition, conifer tree recruitment, and active layer thickness (ALT). We also assessed conifer seed rain and used a seeding experiment to determine factors controlling post-fire tree regeneration. We found that an average of 2.18 ± 1.13 Kg C m -2 was emitted from this fire, almost 95% of which came from burning of the organic soil. On average, burn depth of the organic soil was 10.6 ± 4.5 cm and both burn depth and total C combusted increased with pre-fire conifer density. Sites with higher pre-fire conifer density were also located at warmer and drier landscape positions and associated with increased ALT post-fire, greater changes in pre- and post-fire understory vegetation communities, and higher post-fire boreal tree recruitment. Our seed rain observations and seeding experiment indicate that the recruitment potential of conifer trees is limited by seed availability in this forest-tundra ecotone. We conclude that the expected climate-induced forest infilling (i.e. increased density) at the forest-tundra ecotone could increase fire severity, but this infilling is unlikely to occur without increases in the availability of viable seed."
https://openalex.org/W3209172474,"In recent years, Xinjiang mutton production has experienced a growth trend; however, it cannot meet the new consumer demand. Based on Michael Porter's ""diamond model,"" this study presents a case study on the Xinjiang mutton industry in China and establishes an index system for the competitiveness of the industry. The competitiveness of the mutton industry is analyzed quantitatively via correlation analysis and principal component analysis by investigating the relevant data of 10 Chinese provinces topping in mutton production. On account of the related elements of the diamond model, a qualitative analysis is also performed. The quantitative analysis shows that among the 10 provinces (regions) topping in mutton production in China, Inner Mongolia wins in competitiveness, followed by Xinjiang, and Henan ranks at the bottom. The qualitative analysis shows that the Xinjiang mutton industry is inferior in three main factors compared to its competitors, and these are the production factors related to and supporting the industries and the enterprise strategies. Xinjiang performs moderately in terms of the auxiliary government factors. However, Xinjiang is in an advantageous position with respect to the main factors of demand conditions and auxiliary elements of opportunities. Given the existing problems, this study discusses the main reasons for the lack of competitiveness of the Xinjiang mutton industry. It also puts forward some strategic suggestions to enhance the competitiveness of the Xinjiang mutton industry based on the six elements of diamond model."
https://openalex.org/W3208147394,"Background Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCM) is a unique form of cardiomyopathy compared to other etiologies of heart failure. In CCM, risk prediction based on biomarkers has not been well-studied. We assessed the prognostic value of a biomarker panel to predict a composite outcome (CO), including the need for heart transplantation, use of left ventricular assist devices, and mortality. Methods Prospective cohort study of 100 adults with different stages of CCM. Serum concentrations of amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), galectin-3 (Gal-3), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), high sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT), soluble (sST2), and cystatin-C (Cys-c) were measured. Survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models. Results During a median follow-up of 52 months, the mortality rate was 20%, while the CO was observed in 25% of the patients. Four biomarkers (NT-proBNP, hs-cTnT, sST2, and Cys-C) were associated with the CO; concentrations of NT-proBNP and hs-cTnT were associated with the highest AUC (85.1 and 85.8, respectively). Combining these two biomarkers above their selected cut-off values significantly increased risk for the CO (HR 3.18; 95%CI 1.31–7.79). No events were reported in the patients in whom the two biomarkers were under the cut-off values, and when both levels were above cut-off values, the CO was observed in 60.71%. Conclusion The combination of NT-proBNP and hs-TnT above their selected cut-off values is associated with a 3-fold increase in the risk of the composite outcome among CCM patients. The use of cardiac biomarkers may improve prognostic evaluation of patients with CCM."

Hours of daily television exposure and frequency of parent screen-time conversation were assessed from a parent interview at preschool, and the outcome of early childhood curiosity was derived from a child behavior questionnaire at kindergarten. Multivariate linear regression examined the main and interactive effects of television exposure and parent screen-time conversation on kindergarten curiosity and tested for moderation by SES.In adjusted models, greater number of hours of daily television viewing at preschool was associated with lower curiosity at kindergarten (B = -0.14, p = .008). More frequent parent conversation during shared screen-time was associated with higher parent-reported curiosity at kindergarten with evidence of moderation by SES. The magnitude of association between frequency of parent conversation during television viewing and curiosity was greater for children from low SES environments, compared to children from high SES environments: (SES ≤ median): B = 0.29, p < .001; (SES > median): B = 0.11, p < .001.Higher curiosity at kindergarten was associated with greater frequency of parent conversation during shared television viewing, with a greater magnitude of association in low-SES families. While the study could not include measures of television program content, digital media use and non-screen time conversation, our results suggest the importance of parent conversation to promote early childhood curiosity, especially for children with socioeconomic disadvantage."

https://openalex.org/W3208881309,"A significant number of proteins possess sizable intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Due to the dynamic nature of IDRs, NMR spectroscopy is often the tool of choice for characterizing these segments. However, the application of NMR to IDRs is often hindered by their instability, spectral overlap and resonance assignment difficulties. Notably, these challenges increase considerably with the size of the IDR. In response to these issues, here we report the use of sortase-mediated ligation (SML) for segmental isotopic labeling of IDR-containing samples. Specifically, we have developed a ligation strategy involving a key segment of the large IDR and adjacent folded headpiece domain comprising the C-terminus of A . thaliana villin 4 (AtVLN4). This procedure significantly reduces the complexity of NMR spectra and enables group identification of signals arising from the labeled IDR fragment, a process we refer to as segmental assignment . The validity of our segmental assignment approach is corroborated by backbone residue-specific assignment of the IDR using a minimal set of standard heteronuclear NMR methods. Using segmental assignment, we further demonstrate that the IDR region adjacent to the headpiece exhibits nonuniform spectral alterations in response to temperature. Subsequent residue-specific characterization revealed two segments within the IDR that responded to temperature in markedly different ways. Overall, this study represents an important step toward the selective labeling and probing of target segments within much larger IDR contexts. Additionally, the approach described offers significant savings in NMR recording time, a valuable advantage for the study of unstable IDRs, their binding interfaces, and functional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3208946956,"Background Systemic inflammation is related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Elevated peripheral leukocyte count may be a herald of increased systemic inflammation and subclinical disease. Inflammation plays an important role in renal progression. The pattern of total and differential leukocyte count in CKD is not well understood. Besides, the association between total and differential leukocyte count and renal progression is still uncertain. Methods We conducted a community-based cohort study with a follow-up period of two years to evaluate the total and differential leukocyte counts and renal progression association. Results In our study population from the community with a total number of 2128, we found 15.7% (335/2128) CKD patients with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) around 96 ± 26 ml/min/1.73 m 2 . The peripheral total leukocyte count and also differential leukocyte count were significantly negatively correlated with eGFR. A total of 56 patients (3%) experienced a rapid progression of the kidney with the definition of eGFR reduction changes of 30% or greater within two years. Univariate analysis indicated that rapid renal progression was significantly associated with male gender, co-morbidity of diabetes mellitus (DM), higher uric acid levels, higher peripheral neutrophil, monocyte, and eosinophil counts. However, only the peripheral neutrophil count was positively and independently associated with rapid renal progression after multivariate analysis. The ROC curve analysis found that the optimal cutoff value of peripheral neutrophil count for rapid progression was 2760/ mm 3 , with an area under the curve of 0.813. Conclusion Hyperinflammation with higher peripheral total and differential leukocyte count was noted in CKD patients. The peripheral neutrophil count was the only independent factor significantly associated with rapid renal progression. The optimal cutoff point of the peripheral neutrophil count with 2760/mm 3 is useful for determining the high-risk population for rapid renal progression with a satisfying sensitivity and specificity."

https://openalex.org/W3210712502,"Cattle are the main reservoir of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), with O157:H7 the distinctive serotype. EHEC is the main causative agent of a severe systemic disease, Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). Argentina has the highest pediatric HUS incidence worldwide with 12-14 cases per 100,000 children. Herein, we assessed the genomes of EHEC O157:H7 isolates recovered from cattle in the humid Pampas of Argentina. According to phylogenetic studies, EHEC O157 can be divided into clades. Clade 8 strains that were classified as hypervirulent. Most of the strains of this clade have a Shiga toxin stx2a-stx2c genotype. To better understand the molecular bases related to virulence, pathogenicity and evolution of EHEC O157:H7, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of these isolates through whole genome sequencing. The isolates classified as clade 8 (four strains) and clade 6 (four strains) contained 13 to 16 lambdoid prophages per genome, and the observed variability of prophages was analysed. An inter strain comparison show that while some prophages are highly related and can be grouped into families, other are unique. Prophages encoding for stx2a were highly diverse, while those encoding for stx2c were conserved. A cluster of genes exclusively found in clade 8 contained 13 genes that mostly encoded for DNA binding proteins. In the studied strains, polymorphisms in Q antiterminator, the Q-stx2A intergenic region and the O and P γ alleles of prophage replication proteins are associated with different levels of Stx2a production. As expected, all strains had the pO157 plasmid that was highly conserved, although one strain displayed a transposon interruption in the protease EspP gene. This genomic analysis may contribute to the understanding of the genetic basis of the hypervirulence of EHEC O157:H7 strains circulating in Argentine cattle. This work aligns with other studies of O157 strain variation in other populations that shows key differences in Stx2a-encoding prophages."
https://openalex.org/W3211324144,"Program managers routinely design and implement specialised maternal and newborn health trainings for health workers in low- and middle-income countries to provide better-coordinated care across the continuum of care. However, in these countries details on the availability of different training packages, skills covered in those training packages and the gaps in their implementation are patchy. This paper presents an assessment of maternal and newborn health training packages to describe differences in training contents and implementation approaches used for a range of training packages in Ethiopia and Nepal. We conducted a mixed-methods study. The quantitative assessment was conducted using a comprehensive assessment questionnaire based on validated WHO guidelines and developed jointly with global maternal and newborn health experts. The qualitative assessment was conducted through key informant interviews with national stakeholders involved in implementing these training packages and working with the Ministries of Health in both countries. Our quantitative analysis revealed several key gaps in the technical content of maternal and newborn health training packages in both countries. Our qualitative results from key informant interviews provided additional insights by highlighting several issues with trainings related to quality, skill retention, logistics, and management. Taken together, our findings suggest four key areas of improvement: first, training materials should be updated based on the content gaps identified and should be aligned with each other. Second, trainings should address actual health worker performance gaps using a variety of innovative approaches such as blended and self-directed learning. Third, post-training supervision and ongoing mentoring need to be strengthened. Lastly, functional training information systems are required to support planning efforts in both countries."
https://openalex.org/W3208020156,"This paper establishes a compartment model describing the propagation of injurious information among a well-mixed population. We define the information's injuriousness as the people practicing the information being injured and leaving the system. Some informed people practice the information and are active, while others do not practice and are inactive. With the recovery resources fixed, the two groups of informed people's recovering rates are normalized considering the information features. The stability of the nonlinear system is thoroughly studied. Analyzing the reproduction number of the injurious information, we find that in general parameter space, when there are people in an informed compartment, it is not always necessary to consider their recovery resource allocation. Instead, only when their proportion reaches a critical point should it be allocated. Unless the people in an informed compartment form a certain proportion, we can take a laissez-faire attitude towards them. In a more realistic parameter space, once inactive informed people exist, they should be allocated recovery resources. On the one hand, when the recovering rate rises, the focus on both groups of informed people is necessary for more situations. On the other hand, when the rate of active informed people leaving the system rises, ignoring active informed people benefits removing the injurious information in more cases. The model provides qualitative ways in the scenarios of removing injurious information."
https://openalex.org/W3208113800,"In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in microbiome studies to explore microbial alterations causing disease status and unveil disease pathogenesis derived from microbiome environmental modifications. Convincing evidence of lung microbial changes involving asthma has been collected; however, whether lung microbial changes under obesity leads to severe asthma in a state of allergen exposure has not been studied sufficiently. Here, we measured bacterial alterations in the lung of an allergen mouse model induced by a high fat diet (HFD) by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A total of 33 pathogen‑free 3‑week‑old male C57BL/6 mice were used, and they divided randomly into two groups. The Chow diet (n = 16) and high fat diet (n = 17) was administrated for 70 days. Mice were sensitized with PBS or Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extract (Der.p), and concentration levels of total IgE and Der.p-IgE in the blood were measured to quantify immune responses. Although there were no meaningful differences in bacterial species richness in the HFD mouse group, momentous changes of bacterial diversity in the HFD mouse group were identified after the mouse group was exposed to allergens. At a genus level, the fluctuations of taxonomic relative abundances in several bacteria such as Ralstonia, Lactobacillus, Bradyrhizobium, Gaiella, PAC001932_g, Pseudolabrys, and Staphylococcus were conspicuously observed in the HFD mouse group exposed to allergens. Also, we predicted metabolic signatures occurring under microbial alterations in the Chow group versus the Chow group exposed to allergens, as well as in the HFD mouse group versus the HFD group exposed to allergens. We then compared their similarities and differences. Metabolic functions associated with macrophages such as propanoate metabolism, butanoate metabolism, and glycine-serine-threonine metabolism were identified in the HFD group versus the Chow group. These results provide new insights into the understanding of a microbiome community of obese allergic asthma, and shed light on the functional roles of lung microbiota inducing the pathogenesis of severe asthma."
https://openalex.org/W3208198981,"A longer exposure time generally improves individuals' ability to recognize faces. The current research investigates whether this effect varies between genders and whether it is influenced by the gender of the exposed faces. Based on a set of four experimental studies, we advance our knowledge of face recognition, gender, gender distribution of exposed faces, and exposure time in three main ways. First, the results reveal that women are more likely than men to suffer from a decrease in face recognition ability due to a lower exposure time. Second, the findings show that when exposure time is short (vs. long) women recognize a larger proportion of same gender faces and also recognize a larger proportion of same gender faces as compared with the proportion of same gender faces recognized by men. Third, findings reveal that when individuals are only exposed to same gender faces, women recognize more faces than men regardless whether exposure time is short, or long. In short, the findings of this research suggest that insight into the interplay between gender and exposure time length is critical to appropriately determine human beings' ability to recognize faces."
https://openalex.org/W3208847507,"In patients with dense breasts or at high risk of breast cancer, dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is a highly sensitive diagnostic tool. However, its specificity is highly variable and sometimes low; quantitative measurements of contrast uptake parameters may improve specificity and mitigate this issue. To improve diagnostic accuracy, data need to be captured at high spatial and temporal resolution. While many methods exist to accelerate MRI temporal resolution, not all are optimized to capture breast DCE-MRI dynamics. We propose a novel, flexible, and powerful framework for the reconstruction of highly-undersampled DCE-MRI data: enhancement-constrained acceleration (ECA). Enhancement-constrained acceleration uses an assumption of smooth enhancement at small time-scale to estimate points of smooth enhancement curves in small time intervals at each voxel. This method is tested in silico with physiologically realistic virtual phantoms, simulating state-of-the-art ultrafast acquisitions at 3.5s temporal resolution reconstructed at 0.25s temporal resolution (demo code available here). Virtual phantoms were developed from real patient data and parametrized in continuous time with arterial input function (AIF) models and lesion enhancement functions. Enhancement-constrained acceleration was compared to standard ultrafast reconstruction in estimating the bolus arrival time and initial slope of enhancement from reconstructed images. We found that the ECA method reconstructed images at 0.25s temporal resolution with no significant loss in image fidelity, a 4x reduction in the error of bolus arrival time estimation in lesions ( p &lt; 0.01) and 11x error reduction in blood vessels ( p &lt; 0.01). Our results suggest that ECA is a powerful and versatile tool for breast DCE-MRI."
https://openalex.org/W3210466601,"To alleviate the data sparsity and cold start problems for collaborative filtering in recommendation systems, side information is usually leveraged by researchers to improve the recommendation performance. The utility of knowledge graph regards the side information as part of the graph structure and gives an explanation for recommendation results. In this paper, we propose an enhanced multi-task neighborhood interaction (MNI) model for recommendation on knowledge graphs. MNI explores not only the user-item interaction but also the neighbor-neighbor interactions, capturing a more sophisticated local structure. Besides, the entities and relations are also semantically embedded. And with the cross&amp;compress unit, items in the recommendation system and entities in the knowledge graph can share latent features, and thus high-order interactions can be investigated. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that MNI outperforms some of the state-of-the-art baselines both for CTR prediction and top-N recommendation."
https://openalex.org/W3210707518,"In daylight, cone photoreceptors in the retina are responsible for the bulk of visual perception, yet compared to rods, far less is known quantitatively about their biochemistry. This is partly because it is hard to isolate and purify cone proteins. The issue is also complicated by the synergistic interaction of these parameters in producing systems biology outputs, such as photoresponse. Using a 3-D resolved, finite element model of cone outer segments, here we conducted a study of parameter significance using global sensitivity analysis, by Sobol indices , which was contextualized within the uncertainty surrounding these parameters in the available literature. The analysis showed that a subset of the parameters influencing the circulating dark current, such as the turnover rate of cGMP in the dark, may be most influential for variance with experimental flash response, while the shut-off rates of photoexcited rhodopsin and phosphodiesterase also exerted sizable effect. The activation rate of transducin by rhodopsin and the light-induced hydrolysis rate of cGMP exerted measurable effects as well but were estimated as relatively less significant. The results of this study depend on experimental ranges currently described in the literature and should be revised as these become better established. To that end, these findings may be used to prioritize parameters for measurement in future investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3208009955,"Globally, moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) affects approximately 5% of children below five years of age. MAM is a persistent public health problem in Ethiopia. The current approach in Ethiopia for managing MAM is a supplementary feeding program; however, this is only provided to chronically food-insecure areas. The objective of the study was to compare a local-ingredients-based supplement (LIBS) with the standard corn-soy blend plus (CSB+) in treating MAM among children aged 6 to 59 months to test the hypothesis that the recovery rate achieved with LIBS will not be more than 7% worse than that achieved with CSB+.We used an individual randomized controlled non-inferiority trial design with two arms, involving 324 children with MAM aged 6 to 59 months in Wolaita, Southern Ethiopia. One hundred and sixty-two children were randomly assigned to each of the two arms. In the first arm, 125.2 g of LIBS with 8 ml of refined deodorized and cholesterol-free sunflower oil/day was provided. In the second arm, 150 g of CSB+ with 16 ml of refined deodorized and cholesterol-free sunflower oil/day was provided. Each child was provided with a daily ration of either LIBS or CSB+ for 12 weeks. Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were done. ITT and PP analyses showed non-inferiority of LIBS compared with CSB+ for recovery rate [ITT risk difference = 4.9% (95% CI: -4.70, 14.50); PP risk difference = 3.7% (95% CI: -5.91, 13.31)]; average weight gain [ITT risk difference = 0.10 g (95% CI: -0.33 g, 0.53 g); PP risk difference = 0.04 g (95% CI: -0.38 g, 0.47 g)]; and recovery time [ITT risk difference = -2.64 days (95% CI: -8.40 days, 3.13 days); PP difference -2.17 days (95% CI: -7.97 days, 3.64 days]. Non-inferiority in MUAC gain and length/height gain was also observed in the LIBS group compared with the CSB+ group.LIBS can be used as an alternative to the standard CSB+ for the treatment of MAM. Thus, the potential of scaling up the use of LIBS should be promoted.Pan-African Clinical Trial Registration number: PACTR201809662822990."
https://openalex.org/W3208112731,"Soil health assessment can be a critical soil testing tool that includes biological and physical indicators of soil function related to crop and environmental health. Soil health indicator minimum data sets should be regional and management goal specific. The objective of this study was to initiate the steps to develop a soil assessment tool for irrigated orchard soils in Central Washington, United States including defining objectives, gathering baseline data and selecting target indicators. This study measured twenty-one biological, physical and chemical properties of soils in irrigated Central Washington apple orchards including indicators of water availability, root health, fertility, and biological activity. Soil factors were related to fruit yield and quality. Principal components and nonlinear Bayesian modeling were used to explore the relationship between soil health indicators and yield. Soil indicators measurements in Washington state orchards varied widely but generally had lower organic matter, available water capacity, wet aggregate stability and higher percent sand than in other regions. Linear mixed effects models for available water capacity and percent sand showed significant effects on yield, and models for root health ratings and Pratylenchus nematodes had moderate effects. The minimum dataset of soil health indicators for Central Washington orchards should include measurements of water availability (available water capacity, percent sand) and of root health (bean root health rating, Pratylenchus nematodes) in addition to standard fertility indicators to meet stakeholder management goals."
https://openalex.org/W3210064810,"This study investigates the degradation of nifedipine (NIF) by using a novel and highly efficient ultraviolet light combined with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H2O2). The degradation rate and degradation kinetics of NIF first increased and then remained constant as the H2O2 dose increased, and the quasi-percolation threshold was an H2O2 dose of 0.378 mmol/L. An increase in the initial pH and divalent anions (SO42- and CO32-) resulted in a linear decrease of NIF (the R2 of the initial pH, SO42- and CO32- was 0.6884, 0.9939 and 0.8589, respectively). The effect of monovalent anions was complex; Cl- and NO3- had opposite effects: low Cl- or high NO3- promoted degradation, and high Cl- or low NO3- inhibited the degradation of NIF. The degradation rate and kinetics constant of NIF via UV/H2O2 were 99.94% and 1.45569 min-1, respectively, and the NIF concentration = 5 mg/L, pH = 7, the H2O2 dose = 0.52 mmol/L, T = 20 ℃ and the reaction time = 5 min. The ·OH was the primary key reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ·O2- was the secondary key ROS. There were 11 intermediate products (P345, P329, P329-2, P315, P301, P274, P271, P241, P200, P181 and P158) and 2 degradation pathways (dehydrogenation of NIF → P345 → P274 and dehydration of NIF → P329 → P315)."
https://openalex.org/W3210333285,"To build better theories of cities, companies, and other social institutions such as universities, requires that we understand the tradeoffs and complementarities that exist between their core functions, and that we understand bounds to their growth. Scaling theory has been a powerful tool for addressing such questions in diverse physical, biological and urban systems, revealing systematic quantitative regularities between size and function. Here we apply scaling theory to the social sciences, taking a synoptic view of an entire class of institutions. The United States higher education system serves as an ideal case study, since it includes over 5,800 institutions with shared broad objectives, but ranges in strategy from vocational training to the production of novel research, contains public, nonprofit and for-profit models, and spans sizes from 10 to roughly 100,000 enrolled students. We show that, like organisms, ecosystems and cities, universities and colleges scale in a surprisingly systematic fashion following simple power-law behavior. Comparing seven commonly accepted sectors of higher education organizations, we find distinct regimes of scaling between a school's total enrollment and its expenditures, revenues, graduation rates and economic added value. Our results quantify how each sector leverages specific economies of scale to address distinct priorities. Taken together, the scaling of features within a sector along with the shifts in scaling across sectors implies that there are generic mechanisms and constraints shared by all sectors, which lead to tradeoffs between their different societal functions and roles. We highlight the strong complementarity between public and private research universities, and community and state colleges, that all display superlinear returns to scale. In contrast to the scaling of biological systems, our results highlight that much of the observed scaling behavior is modulated by the particular strategies of organizations rather than an immutable set of constraints."
https://openalex.org/W3210523386,"Floodplains represent critical nursery habitats for a variety of fish species due to their highly productive food webs, yet few tools exist to quantify the extent to which these habitats contribute to ecosystem-level production. Here we conducted a large-scale field experiment to characterize differences in food web composition and stable isotopes (δ¹³C, δ¹⁵N, δ³⁴S) for salmon rearing on a large floodplain and adjacent river in the Central Valley, California, USA. The study covered variable hydrologic conditions including flooding (1999, 2017), average (2016), and drought (2012-2015). In addition, we determined incorporation rates and tissue fractionation between prey and muscle from fish held in enclosed locations (experimental fields, cages) at weekly intervals. Finally, we measured δ³⁴S in otoliths to test if these archival biominerals could be used to reconstruct floodplain use. Floodplain-reared salmon had a different diet composition and lower δ13C and δ³⁴S (δ¹³C = -33.02±2.66‰, δ³⁴S = -3.47±2.28‰; mean±1SD) compared to fish in the adjacent river (δ¹³C = -28.37±1.84‰, δ³⁴S = +2.23±2.25‰). These isotopic differences between habitats persisted across years of extreme droughts and floods. Despite the different diet composition, δ¹⁵N values from prey items on the floodplain (δ¹⁵N = 7.19±1.22‰) and river (δ¹⁵N = 7.25±1.46‰) were similar, suggesting similar trophic levels. The food web differences in δ13C and δ³⁴S between habitats were also reflected in salmon muscle tissue, reaching equilibrium between 24-30 days (2014, δ¹³C = -30.74±0.73‰, δ³⁴S = -4.6±0.68‰; 2016, δ¹³C = -34.74 ±0.49‰, δ³⁴S = -5.18±0.46‰). δ³⁴S measured in sequential growth bands in otoliths recorded a weekly time-series of shifting diet inputs, with the outermost layers recording time spent on the floodplain (δ³⁴S = -5.60±0.16‰) and river (δ³⁴S = 3.73±0.98‰). Our results suggest that δ¹³C and δ³⁴S can be used to differentiate floodplain and river rearing habitats used by native fishes, such as Chinook Salmon, across different hydrologic conditions and tissues. Together these stable isotope analyses provide a toolset to quantify the role of floodplains as fish habitats."
https://openalex.org/W3210528576,"The aim of the study was to assess the role of illness perception in adaptation to chronic disease among patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The differences between the obtained configurations of the illness perception components during four measurements and the model of predictions of the values of adaptation indicators, i.e. depression, anxiety and quality of life during subsequent measurements, were analyzed. Illness representation was assessed at baseline via the Illness Representation Questionnaire–Revised. The adaptation indicators–anxiety, depression (measured by HADS) and quality of life (measured by MSIS-29) were measured at baseline and three more times over a five-year period. The k-means cluster analysis (with two-way and repeated measures ANOVA) was conducted in a group of 90 patients (48.89% women and 51.11% men). Subsequently, the mean values of depression, anxiety, physical and psychological quality of life were compared between the clusters using the Kruskall-Wallis test. Finally, a cross-lagged panel modeled for HADS and MSIS-29 subscales in each measurement occasion (T1-T4). Three different illness perception clusters (Anxious, Realistic and Fatalistic Illness Perception named AIP, RIP and FIP) were composed which differentiated the depression, anxiety, quality of life level and age. FIP showed the lowest adaptation outcomes with small differences between AIP and RIP. It was also significantly characterized by the highest age. The positive adaptation indicators were related to the RIP cluster. The model presented rather satisfactory fit ( χ 2 (48) = 81.05; CFI = .968; TLI = .925; SRMR = .050) with slightly inflated RMSEA = .087 (90%CI .053-.120). Based on initial measurements of individual characteristics, it was possible to predict the functioning of patients after several years. For patients with AIP, the covariance of anxiety and depression was significant, for patients with RIP–depression and anxiety, and for patients with FIP–depression. In addition, each of the variables was a predictor of subsequent measurements in particular time intervals, illustrating the dynamics of changes. Results highlight that illness perceptions formed at the beginning of RRMS are important for the process of adaptation to the disease. Moreover, they showed the differences between the adaptation outcomes supporting the idea that a cognitive representation might be important for the level of psychological functioning."

This data is promising, however there are still populations that, despite availability, are declining vaccination. We reviewed vaccine likelihood and receptiveness to recommendation from a doctor or nurse survey responses from 101,048 adults (≥18 years old) presenting to 442 primary care clinics in 8 states and the District of Columbia. Occupation was self-reported and demographic information extracted from the medical record, with 58.3% (n = 58,873) responding they were likely to receive the vaccine, 23.6% (n = 23,845) unlikely, and 18.1% (n = 18,330) uncertain. We found that essential workers were 18% less likely to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. Of those who indicated they were not already ""very likely"" to receive the vaccine, a recommendation from a nurse or doctor resulted in 16% of respondents becoming more likely to receive the vaccine, although certain occupations were less likely than others to be receptive to recommendations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look at vaccine intent and receptiveness to recommendations from a doctor or nurse across specific essential worker occupations, and may help inform future early phase, vaccine rollouts and public health measure implementations."

Oxygenation during hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) was proposed to protect the mitochondria but the mechanism is unclear. Additionally, the distribution and uptake of perfusate oxygen during HMP are unknown. This study aimed to examine the feasibility of mitochondrial function analysis during end-ischaemic HMP, assess potential mitochondrial viability biomarkers, and record oxygenation kinetics.This was a randomised pilot study using human livers retrieved for transplant but not utilised. Livers (n = 38) were randomised at stage 1 into static cold storage (n = 6), hepatic artery HMP (n = 7), and non-oxygen supplemented portal vein HMP (n = 7) and at stage 2 into oxygen supplemented and non-oxygen supplemented portal vein HMP (n = 11 and 7, respectively). Mitochondrial parameters were compared between the groups and between low- and high-risk marginal livers based on donor history, organ steatosis and preservation period. The oxygen delivery efficiency was assessed in additional 6 livers using real-time measurements of perfusate and parenchymal oxygen.The change in mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I, II, III, IV) and Krebs cycle enzyme activity (aconitase, citrate synthase) before and after 4-hour preservation was not different between groups in both study stages (p > 0.05). Low-risk livers that could have been used clinically (n = 8) had lower complex II-III activities after 4-hour perfusion, compared with high-risk livers (73 nmol/mg/min vs. 113 nmol/mg/min, p = 0.01). Parenchymal pO2 was consistently lower than perfusate pO2 (p ≤ 0.001), stabilised in 28 minutes compared to 3 minutes in perfusate (p = 0.003), and decreased faster upon oxygen cessation (75 vs. 36 minutes, p = 0.003).Actively oxygenated and air-equilibrated end-ischaemic HMP did not induce oxidative damage of aconitase, and respiratory chain complexes remained intact. Mitochondria likely respond to variable perfusate oxygen levels by adapting their respiratory function during end-ischaemic HMP. Complex II-III activities should be further investigated as viability biomarkers."

Adequate knowledge of the phenological cycle of bracken fern is required to serve as an important tool in formulating management plans to control the spread of the fern. This study aimed to characterize the phenological cycle of bracken fern using NDVI and EVI2 time series data derived from Sentinel-2 sensor. The TIMESAT program was used for removing low quality data values, model fitting and for extracting bracken fern phenological metrics. The Sentinel-2 satellite-derived phenological metrics were compared with the corresponding bracken fern phenological events observed on the ground. Findings from our study revealed that bracken fern phenological metrics estimated from satellite data were in close agreement with ground observed phenological events with R 2 values ranging from 0.53–0.85 ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ). Although they are comparable, our study shows that NDVI and EVI2 differ in their ability to track the phenological cycle of bracken fern. Overall, EVI2 performed better in estimating bracken fern phenological metrics as it related more to ground observed phenological events compared to NDVI.

A total of 1205 adults living in urban villages and non-urban villages were included in the analysis. Unadjusted and multiple multivariate logistic regression were conducted for the dependent variable of engagement in recreational physical activity, frequency of recreational physical activity per week, and hours spent in sedentary behaviors per day. Descriptive analysis was conducted to identify the reasons for not engaging in physical activity among urban villagers and non-urban villagers.

Consecutive patients who underwent blepharoptosis surgery between January 2019 and December 2019 were included. The patients were divided into AP and CLP groups. Computerized corneal topography was used to assess the magnitude and axis of corneal astigmatism. Astigmatism was classified as with-the-rule (WTR), against-the-rule (ATR), or oblique astigmatism (OA) pre- and postoperatively. SIA was calculated by vector analysis using the Cravy and Jaffe methods. The correlation between SIA and margin reflex distance (MRD) was calculated. One hundred and eight eyes from 58 patients (AP group: 85 eyes from 45 patients, CLP group: 23 eyes from 13 patients) were included. The AP group (73.8±7.6 years) was significantly older than the CLP group (47.7±6.6 years). The MRD increased significantly after treatment in both groups. The proportions of WTR, ATR, and OA were 52%, 22%, and 25%, and 86%, 9%, and 4% in the AP and CLP groups, respectively. A shift in astigmatism type was observed in 41% and 13% of patients in the AP and CLP groups, respectively. The average SIA measured using the Cravy method was 0.11±1.22 D in the AP group and -0.28±1.07 D in the CLP group (WTR astigmatism). The SIA calculated using the Jaffe method was 0.78±0.70 D in the AP group and 0.82±0.88 D in the CLP group. There was no significant correlation between SIA calculated using the Cravy and Jaffe methods and MRD. ATR was most common in age-related ptosis and WTR was most common in contact lens-related ptosis.

A pilot trial of a 3DP customized head protection prototype device (HPPD) on 10 subjects was conducted during the subacute rehabilitation phase. Materials and methods Subjects &gt; 30 days post-DC with stable cranial flaps and healed wounds were enrolled. HPPD were uniquely designed based on individuals’ CT scan, where the base conformed to the surface of the individual’s skin covering the cranial defect, and the lateral surface three-dimensionally mirrored, the contralateral healthy head. Each HPPD was fabricated using the fused deposition modeling method. These HPPD were then fitted on subjects using a progressive wearing schedule and monitored over 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 follow-up (FU) weeks. Outcomes during FU included; reported wearing time/day (hours), subjective pain, discomfort, pruritus, dislodgment, cosmesis ratings; and observed wound changes. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability without pain or wound changes within 30 minutes of HPPD fitting. Results In all, 10 enrolled subjects received 12 HPPDs [5/10 male, mean (SD) age 46 (14) years, mean (SD) duration post-DC 110 days (76)] and all subjects tolerated 30 minutes of initial HPPD fitting without wound changes. The mean (SD) HPPD mass was 61.2 g (SD 19.88). During 8 weeks of FU, no HPPD-related skin dehiscence was observed, while 20% (2/10) had transient skin imprints, and 80% (8/10) reported self-limiting pressure and pruritis. Discussion Findings from this exploratory study demonstrated preliminary feasibility and safety for a customized 3DP HPPD for temporary post-DC head protection over 8 weeks of follow-up. Monitoring and regular rest breaks during HPPD wear were important to prevent skin complications. Conclusion This study suggests the potential for wider 3DP technology applications to provide cranial protection for this vulnerable population."
