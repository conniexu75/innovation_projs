https://openalex.org/W2036985660,"One Ras-dependent protein kinase cascade leading from growth factor receptors to the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) subgroup of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) is dependent on the protein kinase Raf-1, which activates the MEK (MAPK or ERK kinase) dual specificity kinases. A second protein kinase cascade leading to activation of the Jun kinases (JNKs) is dependent on MEKK (MEK kinase). A dual-specificity kinase that activates JNK, named JNKK, was identified that functions between MEKK and JNK. JNKK activated the JNKs but did not activate the ERKs and was unresponsive to Raf-1 in transfected HeLa cells. JNKK also activated another MAPK, p38 (Mpk2; the mammalian homolog of HOG1 from yeast), whose activity is regulated similarly to that of the JNKs."

https://openalex.org/W2018826402,"Coligation of the Fc receptor on B cells, Fc gamma RIIB1, with the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) leads to abortive BCR signaling. Here it was shown that the Fc gamma RIIB1 recruits the phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTP1C after BCR coligation. This association is mediated by the binding of a 13-amino acid tyrosine-phosphorylated sequence to the carboxyl-terminal Src homology 2 domain of PTP1C and activates PTP1C. Inhibitory signaling and PTP1C recruitment are dependent on the presence of the tyrosine within the 13-amino acid sequence. Inhibitory signaling mediated by Fc gamma RIIB1 is deficient in motheaten mice which do not express functional PTP1C. Thus, PTP1C is an effector of BCR-Fc gamma RIIB1 negative signal cooperativity."

https://openalex.org/W2007601206,The mammalian growth factor receptor-binding protein Grb2 is an adaptor that mediates activation of guanine nucleotide exchange on Ras. Grb2 binds to the receptor through its SH2 domain and to the carboxyl-terminal domain of Son of sevenless through its two SH3 domains. It is thus a key element in the signal transduction pathway. The crystal structure of Grb2 was determined to 3.1 angstrom resolution. The asymmetric unit is composed of an embedded dimer. The interlaced junctions between the SH2 and SH3 domains bring the two adjacent faces of the SH3 domains in van der Waals contact but leave room for the binding of proline-rich peptides.
https://openalex.org/W1975831399,African trypanosomes cause disease in humans and animals. Trypanosoma brucei brucei affects cattle but not humans because of its sensitivity to a subclass of human high density lipoproteins (HDLs) called trypanosome lytic factor (TLF). TLF contains two apolipoproteins that are sufficient to cause lysis of T. b. brucei in vitro. These proteins were identified as the human haptoglobin-related protein and paraoxonase-arylesterase. An antibody to haptoglobin inhibited TLF activity. TLF was shown to exhibit peroxidase activity and to be inhibited by catalase. These results suggest that TLF kills trypanosomes by oxidative damage initiated by its peroxidase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2064093220,"Genomic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA consists of two identical RNA molecules joined noncovalently near their 5′ ends in a region called the dimer linkage structure (DLS). Previous work has shown that the putative DLS is localized in a 113-nucleotide domain encompassing the 5′ end of the gag gene. This region contains conserved purine tracks that are thought to mediate dimerization through purine quartets. However, recently, an HIV-1Ma1 RNA dimerization model was proposed as the HIV-1Ma1 RNA dimerization initiation site, involving another region upstream from the splice donor site and possibly confined within a stem-loop. In the present study, we have investigated the dimerization of HIV-1Lai RNA, using in vitro dimerization assays under conditions of low ionic strength, predictive RNA secondary structures determined by computer folding, and antisense DNA oligonucleotides in order to discriminate between these two models. Our results suggest that purine quartets are not involved in the dimer structure of HIV-1Lai RNA and have led to the identification of a region upstream from the splice donor site. This region, comprising an autocomplementary sequence in a possible stem-loop structure, is responsible for the formation of dimeric HIV-1Lai RNA.

All retroviruses have a common feature, namely a genome consisting of two identical unspliced RNA molecules noncovalently linked(1Coffin J.M. Weiss R. Teich N. Varmus H. Coffin G. RNA Tumor Viruses. Vol. 1. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 261-368Google Scholar). It has been shown by electron microscopy that this junction is located close to their 5′ ends, in a structure termed the dimer linkage structure(2Kung H.J. Hu S. Bender W. Bailey J.M. Davidson N.

Dimerization of retroviral RNA is thought to play a crucial role in several steps of the retroviral life cycle. RNA dimerization seems to be closely related to the encapsidation of retroviral RNA, since cis-elements such as the dimer linkage structure (DLS) 1The abbreviations used are: DLSdimer linkage structureHIV-1Lai or Ma1 or NL43human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (strains Lai or Mal or NL43)MoMuLVMoloney murine leukemia virusRSVRous sarcoma virusBLVbovine leukemia virusREVreticuloendotheliosis virusTARtrans-activation response elementntnucleotide. and the encapsidation site (E) are localized within the same region in the genome of MoMuLV**(5Prats A.C.

It has also been suggested that dimerization of retroviral RNA is associated with reverse transcription through interstrand switching(10Panganibam A. Fiore D.

Several attempts have been made to investigate factors responsible for the dimerization event. Reports describe a crucial role for a trans-acting factor, the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NCp7) in the formation of RNA dimers(9Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol.

It has also been demonstrated that in the absence of any cellular or viral protein, HIV-1 RNA is able to spontaneously dimerize in vitro under conditions of high ionic strength(15Marquet R. Baudin F.

König B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4879-4885Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HIV-1Ma1 sequences able to support this spontaneous dimerization have been localized between nucleotides 311 and 415 encompassing the 5′ end of the gag gene(9Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Published results indicate that (i) the HIV-1 RNA dimer is very stable, (ii) antisense RNA cannot form a dimer, and (iii) a consensus sequence, PuGGAPuA, is found in the putative dimerization-encapsidation region of HIV and other retroviral genomes(15Marquet R. Baudin F. Gabus C. Darlix J.L. Mougel M. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 18: 2349-2357Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Marquet et al.(15Marquet R. Baudin F. Gabus C.

König B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4879-4885Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have suggested that the structural motif mediating the association of two identical viral RNA molecules should involve purine quartets. This model is based on the dimerization of telomeric DNA which occurs via the formation of unusual intermolecular quadruple helical structures that are stabilized by guanine base tetrads(19Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). However, dimerization of viral RNA by purine quartets has recently been discussed(20Sakagushi K. Zambrano N. Baldwin E.T. Shapiro B.A. Erickson J.E. Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appela E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5219-5223Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21Berkout B. Oude Essink B.B. Schoneveld I.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). First, Berkout et al.(21Berkout B. Oude Essink B.B. Schoneveld I. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) reported that the HIV-2 mutant RNA, bereft of all PuGGAPuA sites, could dimerize in vitro. Second, Skripkin et al.(22Skripkin E. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4945-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) recently postulated that the linking of the two HIV-1Ma1 RNA molecules is initiated at the level of a short RNA region, located upstream from the splice donor site and consisting of a palindromic sequence in a stem-loop structure. However, this process requires high ionic strength and the presence of MgCl2 in the electrophoresis gel in order to be observed(22Skripkin E. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4945-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 23Marquet R. Paillart J.C. Skripkin E. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similarly, based on an RNA-RNA recognition model, Girard et al. 2P.-M. Girard, B. Bonnet-Mathonière, D. Muriaux, and J. Paoletti, manuscript submitted for publication. identified a possible stem-loop structure containing a palindromic sequence, which is probably responsible for the formation of dimeric MoMuLV RNA. In this report, we analyze the spontaneous in vitro dimerization process of HIV-1Lai RNA, under conditions of low ionic strength, in an attempt to enhance our understanding of the nature of the interactions leading to dimerization and to distinguish between the above described dimerization models. We have characterized the dimer linkage structure by using HIV-1Lai RNA fragments of different lengths, complementary DNA oligonucleotides, and heterodimer formation. BssHII, HaeIII, RsaI, SacI, and SmaI restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs and EcoRI, HindIII, and PstI restriction enzymes and T4 Polynucleotide Kinase from Boehringer Mannheim. Standard procedures and sequencing were used for restriction enzyme digestion and plasmid construction(25Maniatis T. Fritch E.F. Sambrock J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor University Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for plasmid manipulation and preparation. All the constructions were sequenced (United State Biochemical Corp. Kit 70770, Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA Sequencing Kit) in order to verify the exact sequence of the synthesized RNA fragment(26Haseltine W.A. Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The constructed plasmids were transcribed, after appropriate linearization, with T7 RNA polymerase under conditions provided by the RiboMAX™ Large Scale RNA production System (Promega). Derivatives of the plasmid pGEM-3zf (Promega) were constructed to generate viral RNA by in vitro transcription. Plasmid pBRU2 (a gift of Dr. F. Subra) contains the HIV-1Lai cDNA in the pKP59 vector with XbaI-AatII as the cloning site. This plasmid has a deletion of 2701 base pairs from +5367 to +8061 to prevent it from being infectious. The pBRU2 plasmid was digested with SacI (position +224) and PstI (position +960) to produce the viral fragment 224-960 which was inserted into pGEM-3zf (sites SacI/PstI) and resulted in pDM2. The pDM2 plasmid was digested either by HaeIII or RsaI and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase giving rise to transcripts starting from position 224 of the genomic HIV-1Lai RNA sequence and ending at positions 402 and 296, respectively. These fragments will be referred to as fragments 224-402 and 224-296. The pBRU2 plasmid was cleaved with HindIII, and the viral fragment from positions +77 to +631 was inserted into pGEM-3zf previously digested by HindIII and resulted in pDM3. The plasmid pDM3 was digested either by HaeIII or BssHII and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase giving rise to transcripts starting from position 77 of the genomic HIV-1Lai RNA sequence and ending at positions 402 and 257, respectively. These fragments will be referred to as fragments 77-402 and 77-257. The pDM3 plasmid was cleaved with RsaI and HindIII: the viral fragment from position 296 to 631 was isolated and inserted into pGEM-3zf previously digested with SmaI and HindIII, and resulted in pDM6. The pDM6 plasmid was digested by HaeIII and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase giving rise to transcripts starting from position 296 of the genomic HIV-1Lai RNA sequence and ending at position 402. This fragment will be referred to as fragment 296-402. Polymerase chain reactions (27Milligan J.F. Groebe D. Whiterell G. Uhlenbeck O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar) were performed on pDM2 with two sets of oligonucleotides. The first set contained the T7 universal primer and oligonucleotide D1, corresponding to the complementary positions +256(5′) to +236(3′) of the HIV-1Lai genome. The second set contained oligonucleotide D2 corresponding to positions +263(5′) to +280(3′) of the HIV-1Lai genome and the complementary sequence of the SP6 universal primer. The first polymerase chain reaction product was digested by the EcoRI enzyme and the second by PstI. Both DNA fragments obtained were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. These two fragments were ligated at their blunt ends and inserted between EcoRI and PstI sites of pGEM-3zf(-). One clone of interest was recovered, pDM7, which contained a viral fragment from position 224 to 960 lacking nt 257-266 of the HIV-1Lai genome. The pDM7 plasmid, first digested by HaeIII, was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and gave rise to a RNA fragment 224-402 bereft of nt 257-266. Under the conditions stipulated by the RiboMAX™ Large Scale RNA Production System, 5 μg of the linearized plasmids were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. The sample was subjected to three phenol chloroform extractions after DNase treatment, and the RNA transcripts were ethanol precipitated in the presence of 0.3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2. The RNA precipitate was dissolved in double-distilled sterile water (20 μl) and microdialyzed (Millipore filters type V6, 0.025 μm) for 2 h against sterile double-distilled water. The purity and integrity of the RNA samples were checked by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. If the purity of the RNA was insufficient, the sample in water was loaded on 1.5% agarose gel and electrophoresed as described above. The corresponding RNA fragment was excised from the agarose gel and purified using a spin-X column (Costar). Ethidium bromide was extracted from the sample with one volume of butanol-1, and RNA was ethanol-precipitated. The concentration was determined by UV spectroscopic measurement at 260 nm. RNA dimerization assays were performed on 0.5 μg of RNA generated in vitro, in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl, to a final volume of 10 μl, for 45-60 min at 37°C. RNA in water was heated for 2 min at 90°C, chilled on ice for 2 min before adding the buffer. Monomeric and dimeric RNA fragments were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis at 5V/cm in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mM EDTA, at 4°C. Ethidium bromide (0.2 μg/ml) was added to the buffer. After denaturation at 95°C for 2 min in nuclease-free water, the RNA was incubated in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl, at a concentration of 1 μM (molecules), at 55°C for 50 min for optimal dimerization. The resulting dimer was then microdialyzed (Millipore filters type V6, 0.025 μm) for 2 h at 4°C against a buffer composed of 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. 10-μl aliquots of each sample were then incubated for 5 min at varying temperatures ranging from 20 to 70°C and electrophoresed as described above. After fluorescent scanning of the gels, the percentage of dimer and monomer was estimated. The percentage of the dimer was defined as the area of the dimer peak divided by the sum of the areas of monomer and dimer peaks. The melting temperature (Tm) was estimated from the plot of the amount of the dimer as a function of temperature. Synthetic DNA oligonucleotides complementary to positions 251-267 (oligonucleotide 257B), 312-326 (oligonucleotide 320B), 322-336 (oligonucleotide 327B), 336-350 (oligonucleotide T), 360-374 (oligonucleotide 365B), and 377-391 (oligonucleotide 382B) of the HIV-1Lai sequence were made using an Applied Biosystem Synthesizer. Another oligonucleotide, 257 M, complementary to positions 268-284 of the HIV-1Ma1 sequence(29Myers G. Korber B. Berzofsky J.A. Smith R.F. Pavlakis G.N. Human Retroviruses and AIDS: A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1992Google Scholar), was used as a control oligonucleotide. It differs from 257B by four nucleotides. All these oligonucleotides were loaded on an 18% polyacrylamide gel in a buffer containing 4 M urea, 50 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mM EDTA, electrophoresed, and purified by excision from the gel by UV shadowing. DNA oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled with [32P]ATP (Amersham, United Kingdom) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The specific radioactivity was about 107 cpm/μg DNA oligonucleotide. RNA 224-402 was heat denatured in the presence of the [32P]DNA oligonucleotide before starting in vitro dimerization process. [32P]DNA oligonucleotide•RNA complexes were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The level of hybridization of the [32P]DNA oligonucleotide to monomer and dimer RNA 224-402 was detected by autoradiography of the corresponding gel. Free energy minimization predictions were made using PCFOLD software (version 4.0) written by M. Zucker in accordance with parameters for the prediction of RNA structures described by Turner et al.(28Turner D.H. Sugimoto N. Jaeger J.A. Longfellow C.E. Freier S.M. Kierzek R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The 5′ sequence of HIV-1Lai has been reviewed (29Myers G. Korber B. Berzofsky J.A. Smith R.F. Pavlakis G.N. Human Retroviruses and AIDS: A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1992Google Scholar) and, in an attempt to determine the secondary structure of our RNA fragments, sequences corresponding to these fragments were folded. To obtain a more detailed characterization of the DLS and the RNA dimerization process of HIV-1Lai, a RNA fragment spanning nucleotides 77-402, which contains the leader region (without the TAR domain) and the 5′ gag sequence (Fig. 1a), was prepared by in vitro transcription and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. After heat denaturation, the RNA is in a monomeric form (Fig. 1c, lane 1), while upon incubation at 37°C in a buffer composed of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl, dimeric RNA appears (Fig. 1c, lane 2). As reported(30Roy C. Tounekti N. Mougel M. Darlix J.L. Paoletti C. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Paoletti J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7287-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), this spontaneous dimerization is specific to retroviral RNA. Similarly, we produced two more RNA fragments: RNA 77-257 and RNA 224-402 (Fig. 1b, RNAs 2 and 3). RNA 77-257, shortened at the 3′ end, lost its ability to dimerize (Fig. 1c, lanes 3 and 4), while RNA 224-402, shortened at the 5′ end, dimerized efficiently (lanes 5 and 6). We obtained up to 80% of the dimer under conditions of low ionic strength. We therefore used the latter RNA as the reference fragment for the remaining experiments. Thermal stability of the HIV-1Lai 70 S genomic RNA dimer has been previously determined: the melting temperature of HIV-1 genomic RNA purified from HIV-1 virions was around 50°C(9Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 31Fu W. Gorelick R.J. Rein A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5013-5018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For comparison, we studied the thermal denaturation of the RNA 224-402 under the same experimental conditions. Once formed at 55°C in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl, the dimer was subjected to thermal denaturation in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA(9Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The results obtained after thermal denaturation of the RNA 224-402 dimer are shown on agarose gel (Fig. 2) together with the denaturation curve representing the relative percentage of the dimer as a function of temperature. Thermal transition from the dimer to the monomer occurred at 53°C. The same Tm value was obtained for dimer RNA 77-402 (data not shown). This Tm value is close to that of entire HIV-1 viral RNA(9Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 31Fu W. Gorelick R.J. Rein A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5013-5018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The correspondence between these two Tm values suggests that the nature of the interactions between the in vitro generated HIV-1Lai RNA fragments is comparable to that of the 70 S natural dimer. The same behavior observed for RNA 77-402 and 224-402 justified our choice of RNA 224-402 as the reference fragment for the following studies. To further define the precise sequence involved in HIV-1Lai dimerization, we applied free energy minimization computer analysis to examine the RNA 224-402 secondary structure. As shown in Fig. 3, the predicted structure appears to be in the form of three stem-loops branched together. Stem-loops II and III, consisting of nt 296-402, correspond to the putative DLS 311-415 of HIV-1Ma1 previously described by Darlix et al.(9Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and contain three purine tracks. The remaining region, spanning nucleotides 224-296, exhibits an autocomplementary stem-loop (loop I in Fig. 3). Based on the HIV-1Ma1 dimerization initiation site recently described by Skripkin et al.(22Skripkin E. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4945-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), we speculate that the presence of this autocomplementary G257CGCGC262 sequence in loop I could be responsible for the recognition of two identical RNA molecules through a loop-loop interaction. Only one autocomplementary loop was found in the HIV-1Lai RNA region investigated. It is noteworthy that our computed model is in accordance with the one proposed by G. P. Harrison for HIV-1NL43(32Harrison G.P. Lever A.M.L. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4144-4153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which comprises this stem-loop with the same primary sequence. To test the validity of this assumption, suggested by computer-assisted analysis of RNA 224-402 folding, we hybridized a set of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides to RNA 224-402. The DNA oligonucleotides chosen were complementary to small sequences of RNA 224-402 (Fig. 3). The selected oligonucleotides (see “Experimental Procedures”) were 5′-32Plabeled and heat denatured with RNA 224-402 before initiating the dimerization process. The first question to be addressed was: is the autocomplementary stem-loop I, which encompasses nt 251-266, involved in the dimerization of HIV-1Lai RNA? We studied the dimerization process of RNA 224-402 when incubated with increasing concentrations of oligonucleotide 257B. As shown in Fig. 4a, antisense oligonucleotide 257B, which targets the autocomplementary sequence 257-262, completely blocks dimerization. Total inhibition of dimerization is observed for RNA 224-402 when the oligonucleotide 257B ratio was equal to 1:1. The affinity constant can be estimated to be 0.1 to 1 μM of the antisense DNA oligonucleotide 257B for the RNA 224-402 target (for a strand concentration of 1 μM). Autoradiogram (Fig. 4b) shows that oligonucleotide 257B only hybridizes to RNA 224-402 in its monomeric form. Two antisense DNA oligonucleotides were used as controls. Oligonucleotide 257 M, differing from oligonucleotide 257B by four nucleotides in its sequence, is unable to prevent the dimer formation of RNA 224-402 (Fig. 5A). It converts 50% of the dimer into the monomer when its concentration is 5-fold higher. The other control oligonucleotide T (see “Experimental Procedures”) does not inhibit the RNA 224-402 dimerization process, even at high concentrations (Fig. 5B). It should be noted that oligonucleotide 257M is not bound to the RNA fragment since it migrates as a free oligonucleotide in the gel. Consequently, it did not anneal RNA 224-402 because of the presence of its four mutated nucleotides. Such was not the case with oligonucleotide T which hybridizes to the RNA target 224-402 (in Fig. 5B a difference can be observed in dimer shift mobility in the gel when oligonucleotide T concentrations increase). The second question was: Were antisense DNA oligonucleotides 320B, 327B, 365B, and 382B, which are complementary to polypurine tracks, able to interfere with dimer formation? Oligonucleotides 327B, 365B, and 382B are complementary to PuGGAPuA sequences, and oligonucleotide 320B targets a GGAGG sequence which was proposed by Sundquist and Heaphy (16Sundquist W. Heaphy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3393-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) as an attractive candidate for a purine-rich region involved in dimerization. As shown in Fig. 6A, neither completely inhibited RNA 224-402 dimer formation, and oligonucleotide 327B never reduced the amount of dimer by more than 50%. In every case, each [32P]DNA oligonucleotide annealed to both monomer and dimer RNA 224-402 (see autoradiographies, Fig. 6A). Each RNA 224-402 molecule contains four polypurine sequences. We postulate that any of these sequences are able to interact indifferently with any of those in a second RNA 224-402 molecule. We therefore incubated the four oligonucleotides 320B, 327B, 365B, and 382B together with the RNA 224-402 (Fig. 6B) and found that dimerization still occurred. [32P]DNA oligonucleotides marked monomeric and dimeric forms of the RNA 224-402 equally (see autoradiogram, Fig. 6B). Based on the results of DNA oligonucleotide mapping, we synthetized three new shorter HIV-1Lai RNA fragments, derived from RNA 224-402: RNA 224-296, which only contains the autocomplementary stem-loop I, RNA 296-402, which contains the four polypurine tracks mentioned above, and RNA 224-402DEL bereft of the G257CGCGCACGG266 sequence (Fig. 1b, RNAs 4-6). We analyzed their ability to dimerize spontaneously in vitro (Fig. 1c). We found that RNA 224-296 dimerized very efficiently (Fig. 1c, lanes 7 and 8), while RNA 296-402 was unable to dimerize (lanes 11 and 12) under the salt conditions used to study the dimerization process(30Roy C. Tounekti N. Mougel M. Darlix J.L. Paoletti C. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Paoletti J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7287-7292Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).2 To confirm the role of the autocomplementary G257CGCGC262 sequence in HIV-1Lai dimerization, nucleotides 257-266 were deleted from RNA 224-402. This deleted RNA was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to estimate the degree of dimerization (Fig. 1b, RNA 5). RNA 224-402DEL lost the capacity to form dimeric RNA (Fig. 1c, lanes 9 and 10) while RNA 224-402 formed up to 80% of the dimer under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1c, lane 6). The 10-nucleotide deletion did not alter the overall predicted secondary structure of the molecule in spite of a modification in the primary sequence of the stem-loop which was no longer autocomplementary (Fig. 8c). Furthermore, it is noteworthy that RNA 77-257 corresponds to an RNA molecule spliced in loop I: it had lost the capacity to dimerize efficiently (Fig. 1, b and c, lanes 3 and 4). We therefore conclude that the 257-266 sequence is involved in the formation of dimeric HIV-1Lai RNA. Finally, to determine whether dimerization of HIV-1Lai RNA 77-402 and RNAs 224-402 and 224-296 occurred via the same mechanism, we tried to form heterodimers containing one HIV-1Lai RNA 77-402 molecule and one molecule of the shorter HIV-1Lai RNAs. When an in vitro dimerization reaction was performed with RNA 77-402 and RNA 224-402, or RNA 224-296, we were able to detect heterodimers. The new band between the monomeric and dimeric forms of RNA 77-402 was clearly visible (Fig. 7, a and b, lanes HD). By contrast, no intermediate band could be detected with RNA 296-402 (Fig. 7c, lane HD) or RNA 224-402DEL (Fig. 7d, lane HD): indeed no heterodimer was formed. Thus, the mechanism of HIV-1Lai RNA dimerization is most probably common to RNAs of different sizes, only if they contain the 257-266 sequence. The heterodimers have a dimerization region similar to that of the homodimers. We present here data on the in vitro dimerization of HIV-1 RNA transcripts (strain Lai) under conditions of low ionic strength. As shown in Fig. 1, HIV-1Lai RNA 77-402, a 5′ leader RNA fragment, can efficiently dimerize in vitro. This RNA does not contain the TAR domain but, according to Berkout et al.(21Berkout B. Oude Essink B.B. Schoneveld I. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), who has implicated TAR inverted sequences in the dimerization process, this domain should not play any role. Likewise, shorter RNAs 224-402 and 224-296 can dimerize up to 80-90% in low ionic strength buffer whereas RNAs 77-257 and 296-402 cannot. RNA 224-402 was chosen as the reference fragment for the study. Computer folding analysis of RNA 224-402 showed that an autocomplementary sequence could be a part of a stem-loop structure (loop I in Fig. 3). When this sequence is deleted from this region, the RNA (224-402DEL) is unable to dimerize (Fig. 1) although the predicted stem-loop structure may be conserved (Fig. 8c). Furthermore, and consistent with this finding, a DNA oligonucleotide, complementary to this region, totally inhibits the HIV-1Lai dimerization process (Fig. 4), whereas control oligonucleotides 257M and T do not (Fig. 5). A hypothetical mechanism for RNA dimerization, based on an extensive comparison of sequences in the leader regions of 30 retroviral genomes, has been proposed(15Marquet R. Baudin F. Gabus C. Darlix J.L. Mougel M. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 18: 2349-2357Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This comparative analysis suggested that the consensus sequence PuGGAPuA participates in the dimerization process through the formation of purine quartets involving both adenine(s) and guanine(s). As HIV-1Lai RNA 224-402 contains three such sites as well as the GGAGG sequence described by Sundquist and Heaphy (16Sundquist W. Heaphy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3393-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we tested the role of these elements in the dimerization process. Surprisingly, RNA 224-296, derived from RNA 224-402 but totally bereft of purine consensus sites, was able to dimerize spontaneously in vitro with the same efficiency (Fig. 1). Furthermore, this RNA 224-296 was able to form a heterodimer with the leader RNA 77-402. RNA 224-296 therefore acts as an antisense RNA since we observed more heterodimer than the homodimer 77-402 (Fig. 7b). The remaining RNA region 296-402, which corresponds to the DLS 311-415 of HIV-1Ma1, previously shown to support the necessary sequence for HIV-1 dimerization(9Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), was neither able to dimerize in vitro under conditions of low ionic strength (Fig. 1), nor to form a heterodimer with RNA 77-402 (Fig. 7d). We therefore failed to inhibit the formation of RNA dimer 224-402 in the presence of the antisense DNA oligonucleotides 320B, 327B, 365B, and 382B (Fig. 6) which target the purine tracks. We observed that the oligonucleotide 327B reduced the amount of the dimer by only 50% (Fig. 6A). The partial inhibition of dimerization by the oligonucleotide 327B probably implicates another region that may participate, to a certain extent, in the stabilization of the final structure of the dimer. However, the total inhibition observed with oligonucleotide 257B indicates that this stabilization, in itself, is not sufficient enough to lead to the formation of the dimer. Our results suggest that a recognition mechanism between the two identical RNA molecules is operating via a loop-loop interaction through nucleotides G257CGCGC262 in loop I (Fig. 3). We postulate that a transient complex is formed between complementary nucleotides in loops. The opening of both stem-loops during the interaction could lead to a double-stranded region via Watson-Crick base pairing, as shown in Fig. 8, a and b. This mechanism is proposed in the light of two similar mechanisms described for (i) the formation of a duplex between RNA I and RNA II from plasmid ColE1 (33Eguchi Y. Itoh T. Tomizawa J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 631-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and (ii) the antisense RNA CopA and its target RNA CopT in the replication of plasmid R1(34Persson C. Gerhart E. Wagner H. Nordström EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3767-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism for the HIV-1Lai DLS signal is in good agreement with recent analytical studies on HIV-1Ma1 RNA dimerization(22Skripkin E. Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4945-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), except for a difference observed by us in dimer stability. This difference could be attributed to a sequence modification when it passes from HIV-1Lai to HIV-1Ma1 RNA (5′… G254AAGCGCGCACGG266… 3′ to 5′… G271AGGUGCACACAG283… 3′). The HIV-1Lai RNA 224-402 dimer is strongly stabilized through the GC residues present in the dimerization sequence (Fig. 8). It dissociates into the monomer at 53°C (Fig. 2). This Tm value is in good agreement with that found by Darlix et al.(9Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) with the full-length HIV-1Lai viral RNA isolated from wild-type virus particles. The nucleotides GCGCGC are remarkably conserved in 18 of the 21 HIV-1 strains observed(29Myers G. Korber B. Berzofsky J.A. Smith R.F. Pavlakis G.N. Human Retroviruses and AIDS: A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1992Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations observed in the stem-loop of various HIV-1 strains were offset so that the structure and the autocomplementary sequence were maintained (except for HIVHXB2 strain). A potential link between dimerization and encapsidation of HIV-1 genomic RNA has been proposed(7Darlix J.-L. Gabus C. Allain B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7245-7252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel F. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 31Fu W. Gorelick R.J. Rein A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5013-5018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kim et al.(35Kim H.-J. Lee K. O'Rear J.J. Virology. 1994; 198: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have recently constructed several recombinant HIV-1Lai proviral DNA clones. One of them, lacking 13 bases upstream from the splice donor site, produced a virus with less efficient packaging of its genomic RNA than a virus bearing mutations between the 5′ splice donor site and the gag gene. This deletion encompasses nucleotides 241-253 which are a part of stem-loop I shown in Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, Figure 7:, Figure 8:a. Understanding the structures present in dimeric retroviral RNAs is therefore an essential prerequisite for antiviral strategies. We therefore propose stem-loop I as a potential target in attempts to interfere with HIV-1 replication. Since one of the current antisense strategies is based on targeting oligonucleotides to complementary sequences of an RNA molecule, oligonucleotide 257B is proposed for this function. HIV-1Lai RNA is totally inhibited in vitro, under conditions akin to physiological ones, by this antisense DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the putative stem-loop I which contains the autocomplementary GCGCGC sequence. We thank Frédéric Subra (IGR, Villejuif) for the gift of plasmid pBRU2, Philippe Fossé (IGR, Villejuif) for helpful discussions, and Filippo Rusconi di Lugano (CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette) and Lorna St-Ange (IGR, Villejuif) for critical reading of the manuscript. Addendum-While this manuscript was reviewed, Laughrea et al.(24Laughrea M. Jetté L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13464-13474Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) have speculated that the 248-270 or 233-285 region forms a hairpin that is the core dimerization domain of HIV-1Lai RNA. Our results and theirs are complementary and mutually supportive: we reached the same postulated dimerization model of HIV-1 RNA."

The mechanism of this translocation and the identity of the storage site are unknown, but it has been hypothesized that transporters recycle between an insulin-sensitive pool, endosomes, and the cell surface. Upon cell homogenization and fractionation, the storage site migrates with light microsomes (LDM) separate from the plasma membrane fraction (PM).

INTRODUCTIONInsulin stimulates glucose uptake into muscle and fat cells by recruiting glucose transporters (predominantly the GLUT4 isoform) from an intracellular storage site to the cell surface(1Cushman S.

In spite of the wide documentation of this phenomenon through biochemical and morphological techniques(3Zorzano A. Wilkinson W. Kotliar N. Thoidis G. Wadzinkski B.E. Ruoho A.E. Pilch P.F. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), the identity of the intracellular organelle endowed with glucose transporters and the mechanism of its incorporation into the plasma membrane remain largely unknown.Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the intracellular traffic of glucose transporters. It has been proposed that regulation of GLUT4 intracellular traffic may share characteristics of the process of regulated secretion (a phenomenon involving fusion of specialized exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane that occurs only in response to a stimulus). Support for the regulated exocytotic pathway is provided by the targeting of transfected GLUT4 glucose transporters to secretory granules in neuroendocrine PC12 cells(5Hudson A.W. Fingar D.C.

These proteins, named vesicle-associated membrane proteins or VAMPs 1The abbreviations used are: VAMPvesicle-associated membrane proteinPVDFpolyvinylidine difluoridePBSphosphate-buffered salinePMplasma membranesHDMhigh density microsomesLDMlow density microsomesTMtotal membranePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisSCAMPsecretory carrier associated membrane protein. /synaptobrevins, consist of two isoforms, I and II, both of 18 kDa, and are found in synaptic vesicles of neuronal cells(8Jahn R.

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). An antibody raised to the common domain of all VAMPs was recently shown to react with polypeptides of molecular mass of 17 and 18 kDa in GLUT4-containing membranes of rat white adipocytes(7Cain C.C. Trimble W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11681-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and with yet a third band of lower molecular weight(12Laurie S.M. Cain C.C. Lienhard G.E. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19110-19117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It has also been suggested that glucose transporters recycle constitutively through the endocytic pathway (a phenomenon involving continuous formation of clathrin coated vesicles, their incorporation into endosomes and subsequent fusion of endosome-derived vesicles with the plasma membrane). The participation of the endocytic pathway in the intracellular traffic of glucose transporters is based on morphological and kinetic criteria. GLUT4 proteins can be detected by immunocytochemistry in clathrin-coated vesicles and early endosomes of white (13Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and brown (4Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) adipocytes, although it is still debated whether insulin augments (13Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) or diminishes (14Chakrabarti R. Buxton J. Joly M. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7926-7933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the amount of GLUT4 in these structures. GLUT4 immunolabeling has also been demonstrated in endosomes filled with extracellular material(4Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The presence of the glucose transporter in endosomes could reflect its routing to the lysozomes, or alternatively its storage in a compartment capable of recycling. It has been shown that GLUT4 cycles to and from the cell membrane in the basal state(15Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4600-4603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kandror K. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps through endocytosis signals in its primary sequence(17Corvera S. Chawla A. Chakrabarti R. Joly M. Buxton J. Czech M.P.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 120-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, disruption of the clathrin coat by low K+ causes accumulation of GLUT4 polypeptides at the cell surface(19Nishimura H. Zarnowski M.J. Simpson I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19246-19253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin augments the rate of appearance of GLUT4 glucose transporters at the cell surface (15Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol.

Collectively, these observations suggest that GLUT4 continuously recycles to and from the cell surface and that the rate of this process is altered by insulin (18James D.E. Piper R.C. Slot J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 120-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Recently, a protein belonging to the synaptobrevin family was purified and found to be localized in recycling endosomes(23McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This protein, named cellubrevin, is thought to be a marker of endocytic vesicles rather than of specialized secretory vesicles. In contrast to the circumscribed tissue expression of VAMP-1 and VAMP-2, the 17-kDa cellubrevin is widely distributed in a variety of tissues(23McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This protein is present in coated vesicles isolated from hepatocytes (23McMahon H.T.

Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and colocalizes with the transferrin receptor in CV-1 (23McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and Chinese hamster ovary cells(24Galli T. Chilcote T. Mundigl O. Binz T. Niemann H. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).In the present study, we investigate whether the endocytic marker cellubrevin is expressed in mouse 3T3-L1 cells, if its levels change during differentiation from fibroblasts into adipocytes, and whether this protein is involved in insulin-regulated intracellular traffic. We describe that, like GLUT4, cellubrevin translocates to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. Furthermore, cellubrevin is found to be a resident protein of GLUT4-containing vesicles, and immunopurified cellubrevin-containing vesicles contain GLUT4. Finally, we show that the VAMP isoform expressed in adipocytes is VAMP-2. These results suggest that there are GLUT4 vesicles containing cellubrevin and VAMP-2. The possibility that there are two types of intracellular GLUT4-containing vesicles is discussed, vis a vis the possible participation of the endosomal system and of vesicular exocytosis in the regulation of intracellular traffic of the GLUT4 transporter.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsCell culture medium, serum, supplements and reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, 0.2-μm pore size) membranes were obtained from Bio-Rad. The immunoprecipitating anti-GLUT4 antiserum was prepared by immunizing rabbits with synthetic peptides corresponding to the 12 C-terminal amino acids of the GLUT4 protein as described by James et al.(2James D.E. Strube M. Mueckler M. Nature. 1989; 338: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting. Anti-GLUT4 antiserum (East Acres Biologicals, Southbridge, MA) was diluted 1:1000. Affinity-purified anti-cellubrevin antiserum D204 (kind gift from Dr. T. C. Südhof, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Dallas, TX) (23McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. The anti-cellubrevin antibody does not cross-react with either VAMP-1 or VAMP-2(23McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Two anti-VAMP-2 antibodies were used. One was raised to a peptide corresponding to the unique N-terminal sequence of VAMP-2 (kind gift from Dr. W. Trimble, University of Toronto) that was previously shown to react specifically and uniquely with this protein and not with either VAMP-1 or cellubrevin(25Volchuk A. Mitsumoto Y. He L. Liu Z. Habermann E. Trimble W. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and one raised to a fusion protein encompassing residues 1-96, which includes the middle domain common to other synaptobrevins as well as the N terminus sequence unique to VAMP-2. As discussed in this study, this antibody reacted only very weakly with cellubrevin. Anti α1 Na+/K+-ATPase monoclonal antibody 6H (a kind gift from Dr. M. Caplan, Yale University, New Haven, CT), was used at a 1:500 dilution. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc, West Grove, PA. Goat serum was from Life Technologies, Inc. Slow Fade™ was from Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR. Recombinant VAMP-1 and VAMP-2 (glutathione S-transferase derivatives of the cytosolic portion of each synaptobrevin) were a gift from Dr. W. Trimble, University of Toronto. Purified tetanus toxin light chain was a kind gift from Dr. Ernst Habermann, Justus-Leibig Universitat, Giesen, Germany.ImmunofluorescenceIndirect immunofluorescence was performed according to the method of Piper et al.(26Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 3T3-L1 cells were grown on glass coverslips, differentiated into adipocytes 2 days before reaching confluence, washed 2 times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Excessive fixative was quenched by incubation in PBS containing 100 mM glycine for 15 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated with 10% goat serum in PBS for 20 min. After three more washes in PBS, coverslips were incubated with anti-cellubrevin antibody (dilution 1:10 in PBS) at 4°C overnight. Cells were then washed 3 × 15 min in PBS, incubated for 60 min with 6 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG at room temperature, and mounted in Slow Fade™. Coverslips were examined with an Olympus VANOX AHBT3 fluorescence microscope.Cell Culture and Subcellular Fractionation3T3-L1 fibroblasts, kindly provided by Dr. D. Lane (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD), were differentiated into adipocytes as described previously(27Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from two 10-cm dishes/condition were pretreated for 3 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated with or without 100 nM insulin for 20 min at 37°C and fractionated according to Piper et al.(26Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain plasma membranes (PM), high density microsomes (HDM), and low density microsomes (LDM). The protein content of the fractions was determined by the Bio-Rad procedure. Total membranes (TM) from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts or adipocytes were prepared as follows. Monolayers were rinsed twice with ice-cold homogenization buffer (255 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μM pepstatin A, 1 μM leupeptin, 10 μM E-64, 1 mM EDTA, and 20 mM Na-HEPES, pH 7.4), scraped vigorously with a rubber policeman into 4 ml of the same buffer, and homogenized with 30 strokes of a Teflon pestle in a glass homogenizer at 1200 rotations/min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 min to pellet the nuclei and large cellular debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 245,000 × g for 90 min to sediment the total membranes. The membrane samples were resuspended in homogenization buffer.Treatment with Tetanus ToxinMembrane fractions derived from 3T3-L1 cells were freeze dried and resuspended in 20 μl of potassium glutamate buffer (138 mM potassium glutamate, 20 mM HEPES, 8 mM MgCl2, 0.285 mM CaCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.15) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 with or without the indicated concentrations of tetanus toxin light chain prepared as in (28Weller U. Dauzenroth M.E. Meyer Zu Heringdorf D. Habermann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated at 37°C in a water bath under constant agitation for 1 h; a brief vortex was given at the 30-min interval. The samples were then boiled for 3 min in 20 μl of 2 × concentrated Laemmli sample buffer and immediately resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then electrotransferred and immunoblotted.Immunoprecipitation of GLUT4-containing Vesicles and of Cellubrevin-containing VesiclesGLUT4-containing vesicles were immunoprecipitated by a modification of the protocol of Laurie et al.(12Laurie S.M. Cain C.C. Lienhard G.E. Castle J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19110-19117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 μl of anti-GLUT4 serum or preimmune serum were incubated with 100 μl of sheep anti-rabbit IgG magnetic beads (M-280 Dynabeads, Dynal Inc, Great Neck, NY) in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (KP) containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 5-6 h at 4°C under constant rotation then washed 3 times with 0.5 ml of KP-bovine serum albumin. Adipocyte monolayers were fractionated as above using 5 ml of homogenization buffer/10-cm diameter dish to remove nuclei, mitochondria, plasma membranes, and heavy microsomes but without sedimenting the LDM. The supernatant (500 μl containing approximately 350 μg protein of LDM), adjusted to 100 mM KP, was added to the beads and incubated 16-18 h at 4°C under constant rotation. The supernatant was removed, the beads were washed 3 times with KP without bovine serum albumin, and the resulting supernatants were combined with the first one. Pooled supernatants were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 60 min, and the sedimented membranes were resuspended in 2 × concentrated Laemmli sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) containing 8 M urea (sample named Supernatant). The material bound to the pelleted magnetic beads was equally solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer containing 8 M urea (sample named Pellet). The entire volumes of Supernatant and Pellet were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For immunopurification of cellubrevin-containing vesicles, a similar procedure was employed except that the anti-cellubrevin antiserum was used as primary antibody and an irrelevant serum was used for the nonimmune serum control.PAGE and ImmunoblottingMembrane proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) in 13 and 14% polyacrylamide gels (as indicated in the figure legends) and transferred electrophoretically to PVDF membranes. Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously(25Volchuk A. Mitsumoto Y. He L. Liu Z. Habermann E. Trimble W. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Bound monoclonal antibodies were detected with 125I-labeled sheep-anti-mouse IgG. Polyclonal antibodies with 125I-labeled protein A or Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) as indicated in the figure legends. Scanning of x-ray films was done using a PDI model DNA35 scanner with the version 1.3 of the Discovery Series one-dimensional gel analysis software.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was extracted from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts or adipocytes and from rat brain (as control), using the single-step RNA isolation with acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform(30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar), quantitated by its 260/280 UV absorbance and electrophoresed under denaturing conditions in 1.2% (w/v) agarose gels containing 8% (v/v) formaldehyde. RNA was then transferred onto nytron membranes and baked for 90 min at 80°C in a vacuum oven. Equal loading of all samples containing 20 μg of RNA (3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes) was confirmed by the ethidium bromide fluorescence incorporated into nucleic acids. Where indicated, mRNA was isolated using the Dynabeads mRNA direct kit (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nytron membranes containing RNA or mRNA samples were pre-hybridized overnight at 42°C with 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA in 6 × SSPE (1 × SSPE: 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), 10 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS. Hybridization was carried out in 50% formamide, 6 × SSPE, 0.5% SDS, 5% dextran sulfate, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 16 h at 37°C by adding [α-32P]dCTP-labeled VAMP-1 cDNA (5.5 × 108 cpm/μg DNA) or VAMP-2 cDNA (5.7 × 108 cpm/μg DNA), each labeled by the random primer method. The VAMP-1 probe corresponded to nucleotides 1-1470 of the rat VAMP-1 sequence(31Elferink L.A. Trimble W.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11061-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the VAMP-2 probe corresponded to nucleotides 1-432. Both were the kind gift of Dr. W. Trimble, University of Toronto. Following hybridization, nytron membranes were washed 3 × 5 min with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and 2 × 1 h with 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65°C prior to exposure to DuPont autoradiographic film at −70°C.RESULTSExpression of Cellubrevin during Differentiation of 3T3-L1 CellsFig. 1 examines the expression of cellubrevin in total membranes of undifferentiated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The first lane (Br) shows that the anti-cellubrevin antibody does not react with proteins present in rat brain homogenates, suggesting that it does not cross-react with either VAMP-1 or VAMP-2, abundant proteins of brain stem and brain, respectively(32Trimble W.S. J. Physiol. 1993; 87: 107-115Google Scholar). Lanes labeled FTM (fibroblast total membranes) contained total membranes of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, in which the 17 kDa band of cellubrevin was not detectable. Overexposure of the x-ray films revealed a very faint band in this fraction in the absence of tetanus toxin light chain (lane “[minus]”), and this weak band totally disappeared in fibroblast total membranes treated with the toxin in vitro (lane “+”). Lanes labeled ATM (adipocyte total membranes) show the significantly higher abundance of the 17 kDa band in total membranes of fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared with undifferentiated fibroblasts. Treatment with tetanus toxin light chain in vitro completely eliminated the immunoreactive 17 kDa band. This strongly supports the notion that the reactive band is indeed cellubrevin, since the clostridium endopeptidase cleaves VAMPs/synaptobrevins and cellubrevin but not other known proteins(8Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 219-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 32Trimble W.S. J. Physiol. 1993; 87: 107-115Google Scholar). The endopeptidase did not alter the protein profile of the membranes as assessed by Coomassie Blue staining or the content of other membrane proteins such as the GLUT4 glucose transporter (results not shown). These results demonstrate that the abundance of cellubrevin, per mg of protein of total membranes, sharply increases during differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes (also shown more clearly in the last two lanes of Fig. 3).Figure 3:Effect of insulin on the subcellular distribution of α1 Na+/K+-ATPase, GLUT4 glucose transporters, and cellubrevin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The following membrane fractions were isolated from control (C) or insulin-treated (I) 3T3-L1 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures”: adipocyte high density microsomes (HDM), adipocyte plasma membranes (PM), adipocyte low density microsomes (LDM), and adipocyte (A) or fibroblast (F) total membranes (TM). Twenty μg of HDM, PM or LDM, and 40 μg of TM were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 13% polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to PVDF filters. A, the top portion of the filters was immunoblotted with antibodies to the α1 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase (apparent Mr 105,000), and the bottom part was immunoblotted with antibodies to the GLUT4 glucose transporter (apparent Mr 53,000), followed by detection with 125I-labeled sheep-anti-mouse IgG or protein A, respectively. B, parallel samples were resolved on a 14% polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred, and immunoblotted with anti-cellubrevin antibody detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The last four lanes analyze the subcellular distribution of cellubrevin in purified LDM and PM from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Lanes labeled “[minus]” show the amount of the 17-kDa protein in untreated membranes, and lanes labeled “+” show its complete disappearance upon in vitro treatment with tetanus toxin light chain. The 17-kDa protein was present in both the LDM and PM fractions, but per mg of protein it was enriched in the LDM. Scans of six independent experiments show that the relative enrichment per mg of protein in LDM to PM was 2.64 ± 0.54 to 1.00. On average, the subcellular fractionation of one confluent 10-cm dish of 3T3-L1 adipocytes yields approximately 160 μg of protein of PM, 40 μg of protein of HDM, and 225 μg of protein of LDM. When this yield of protein in the LDM and PM fractions was considered, the relative recovery of cellubrevin in these fractions was 3.7 to 1.00. Cellubrevin was located largely in these two fractions, since analysis of HDM of these cells showed only minute amounts of the protein (shown later in Fig. 3). Finally, the anti-cellubrevin antibody did not detect any bands in samples of recombinant VAMP-2 or VAMP-1, respectively (results not shown). This confirms the specificity of the antibody, and its tetanus toxin sensitivity underscores the identity of the 17 kDa band seen in 3T3-L1 cell membranes as cellubrevin.This affinity-purified antibody was therefore used to immunolocalize cellubrevin in permeabilized 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The antibody was previously used to detect cellubrevin by immunofluorescence in CV-1 cells(23McMahon H.T. Ushkaryov Y.A. Edelmann L. Link E. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows a representative micrograph of the distribution of cellubrevin in a 3T3-L1 adipocyte. Panela shows the fluorescence image when focussing near the cell surface, and panelb shows the fluorescence image when focussing at the level of the nucleus. The two images show that immunoreactive cellubrevin was distributed in a pole around the"

In eukaryotes, the N-end rule pathway is a ubiquitin-dependent, proteasome-based system that targets and processively degrades proteins bearing certain N-terminal residues. Arg-DHFR, a modified dihydrofolate reductase bearing an N-terminal arginine (destabilizing residue in the N-end rule), is short lived in ATP-supplemented reticulocyte extract. It is shown here that methotrexate, which is a folic acid analog and high affinity ligand of DHFR, inhibits the degradation but not ubiquitination of Arg-DHFR by the N-end rule pathway. The degradation of other N-end rule substrates is not affected by methotrexate. We discuss implications of these results for the mechanism of proteasome-mediated protein degradation. The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue.

The degradation of other N-end rule substrates is not affected by methotrexate. We discuss implications of these results for the mechanism of proteasome-mediated protein degradation. The surface of a protein molecule bears a number of peptide bonds, which are potential cleavage sites for proteases. Nonetheless, only some intracellular proteins are short-lived in vivo, indicating that most of these solvent-exposed bonds cannot be cleaved by intracellular proteases. Features of a protein that make it short-lived in vivo or in vitro are called degradation signals or degrons (Varshavsky, 1991). The resistance of a long- lived protein to proteases located in the same compartment is due in part to the sequence selectivity of proteases, which require the presence of a sequence motif or at least a specific residue in a substrate. In addition, the rate of peptide bond cleavage by even a relatively nonspecific protease depends on conformational flexibility of the motif that the protease recognizes. For example, only some of the potential cleavage sites on the surface of a globular protein are cleaved efficiently by the bacterial metalloendoprotease thermolysin, and these preferred cleavage sites are located in exposed segments of the polypeptide chain which have the highest spatial mobility (Fontana et al., 1986). Thus, even if a motif recognized by a protease is present on the surface of a protein, conformational rigidity of this potential degron may preclude its efficient utilization by the protease. Conversely, a conformationally destabilized protein may acquire degrons that are masked in an unperturbed version of the protein (Parsell and Sauer, 1989). This can happen not only through conformational relaxation of a previously rigid (and therefore cryptic) surface degron but also through exposure of degrons in previously buried regions of the protein. The mechanistic connection between segmental mobility of a polypeptide chain and its susceptibility to proteolysis stems from a scarcity of local chain conformations that can lend themselves to an optimal transition-state intermediate without a conformational adjustment (Fontana et al., 1986; Creighton, 1992; Hubbard et al., 1994). Dynamic aspects of a substrate's conformation are likely to play a major role in the functioning of intracellular proteolytic systems such as those that involve the multisubunit, multicatalytic protease called the proteasome (for reviews, see Lupas et al., 1995; Rechsteiner et al., 1993; Goldberg and Rock, 1992; Orlowski, 1990). A salient feature of these ATP-dependent systems is their processivity: once the degradation of a protein begins, it proceeds to completion. Thus, a proteasome-mediated system should be able to perturb the conformation of a globular protein substrate before or during its processive degradation by the proteasome. The “conformational” problem to be solved by the proteasome is analogous to the problem faced by a protein translocation system: components of a transmembrane channel must unfold a protein before or during its “threading” across membrane, except that in this case the protein is transported rather than destroyed (Blobel, 1980; Eilers and Schatz, 1986; Sanders and Schekman, 1992; Arkowitz et al., 1992). In the present work, we show that a proteasome-based proteolytic system called the N-end rule pathway is remarkably sensitive to alterations in the conformational stability of its substrates. The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue (for review see Varshavsky, 1992). Similar but distinct versions of the N-end rule operate in all organisms examined, from mammals to bacteria (Bachmair et al., 1986; Gonda et al., 1989; Tobias et al., 1991). In eukaryotes, the N-end rule-based degradation signal, called the N-degron, comprises two determinants: a destabilizing N-terminal residue and an internal lysine (or lysines) of a substrate (Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989; Johnson et al., 1990; Hill et al., 1993). The Lys residue is the site of formation of a multiubiquitin chain (Chau et al., 1989). Ubiquitin (Ub) 1The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinMTXmethotrexateDHFRmouse dihydrofolate reductasehaepitope tag derived from hemagglutininTricineN-[2-hydroxyl-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisβ-galE. coli β-galactosidase. is a protein whose covalent conjugation to other proteins (often in the form of a multi-Ub chain) plays a role in a number of processes, primarily through routes that involve protein degradation (for reviews, see Ciechanover and Schwartz, 1994; Parsell and Lindquist, 1993; Vierstra, 1993; Jentsch, 1992; Varshavsky, 1992; Finley, 1992; Hochstrasser, 1992). ubiquitin methotrexate mouse dihydrofolate reductase epitope tag derived from hemagglutinin N-[2-hydroxyl-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis E. coli β-galactosidase. The recognition of an N-end rule substrate is mediated by a protein called N-recognin or E3. The binding of N-recognin to a substrate's destabilizing N-terminal residue is followed by the formation of a multi-Ub chain linked to an internal lysine of the substrate (the second determinant of its N-degron). A substrate-linked multi-Ub chain is required for the degradation of at least some N-end rule substrates (Chau et al., 1989; Dohmen et al., 1991). In both yeast and mammals, the ~200 kDa N-recognin and a specific ~20-kDa Ub-conjugating (E2) enzyme (one of several such enzymes in a cell) are physically associated, forming a part of a larger targeting complex (Madura et al., 1993; Hershko and Ciechanover, 1992). A substrate bearing a multi-Ub chain is transferred (presumably while still bound by the targeting complex) to the 26 S proteasome, a ~2,000-kDa multicatalytic protease that contains about 40 distinct subunits (Rechsteiner et al., 1993). The ensuing processive degradation of the substrate yields short (~10-residue) peptides and regenerates Ub from a multi-Ub chain. All Ub-dependent proteolytic systems, including the N-end rule pathway, apparently share many components of the 26S proteasome. Differences among these pathways include their distinct targeting complexes, whose recognins (associated with specific E2s) bind to degradation signals other than N-degrons (Varshavsky, 1992). Previous studies (Gonda et al., 1989; Reiss et al., 1988) showed that the N-end rule pathway is active in ATP-supplemented extract from rabbit reticulocytes. In the present work we used this in vitro system and methotrexate (MTX; a folic acid analog and inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)), to determine whether noncovalent conformational stabilization of a protein affects its degradation by the N-end rule pathway. The plasmids pEJJ1-R and pEJJ1-M expressed, respectively, Ub-Arg-eK-DHFRha and Ub-Met-eK-DHFRha (Fig. 1) from the T7 polymerase promoter in Escherichia coli and were constructed using a three-part ligation as follows. (i) The pT7-7 vector (Tabor and Richardson, 1985) was digested with NdeI and HindIII, and the larger fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, yielding the first of three fragments to be ligated. (ii) A fragment encoding the Ub-Arg/Met portions of the above fusions was produced from the plasmid pLG-Ub-M-DHFR (Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989) using polymerase chain reaction (Ausubel et al., 1992) and the primer 5′-GAATTCCATATGCAGATTTTCGTGAAGAC-3′ (the underlined sequence is the NdeI site, whose ATG is the start codon of the UBI4 gene (Özkaynak et al., 1987)). The 3′-primer for this polymerase chain reaction encompassed the BglII site near the junction between sequences encoding the eK extension (Fig. 1) and DHFR. (iii) The third fragment to be ligated, encoding eK-DHFRha, was a ~600-base pair BamHI-HindIII fragment derived from pLG-Ub-M-DHFRha (Johnson, 1992). Ligation of these three fragments (the second one encoding either Arg or Met at the Ub-eK junction) yielded pEJJ1-R and pEJJ1-M, encoding, respectively, Ub-Arg-eK-DHFRha and Ub-Met-eK-DHFRha. The plasmids pPJJ1-R and pPJJ1-M, expressing, respectively, Ub-Arg-Δe-DHFRha and Ub-Met-Δe-DHFRha (Fig. 1), were produced from pEJJ1-R and pEJJ1-M by excising their BamHI-HindIII fragment (encoding eK-DHFRha) and replacing it with a ~600-base pair fragment of pPW17-R (Dohmen et al., 1994), which encoded Arg-His-Gly-Ser-Gly-Ile-Met-DHFRha. E. coli JM101 and DH5α (Ausubel et al., 1992) were used as hosts in plasmid construction and in plasmid preparation for sequencing, respectively. The final constructs were verified by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing (Ausubel et al., 1992). E. coli BL21(DE3) (Studier and Moffat, 1986) was used for overexpression of DHFR-containing fusions. Unless stated otherwise, all procedures were carried out at 4°C. 0.5 ml of an overnight culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying one of the pT7-based plasmids was diluted into 50 ml of Luria broth containing ampicillin at 75 μg/ml, and the culture was grown at 37°C to an A600 of ~0.2; more ampicillin was then added, to a final concentration of 115 μg/ml, and the incubation was continued until an A600 of ~0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. The culture was grown for another 25 min at 30°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min; washed twice with M9 buffer (Ausubel et al., 1992); resuspended in 1 ml of M9 supplemented with 0.22% glucose, rifampicin (0.2 mg/ml), ampicllin (75 μg/ml), and 0.1% methionine assay medium (Difco); and incubated with 0.5 mCi of Tran35S-label (ICN) for 10 min at 30°C. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with Luria broth, twice with M9 buffer, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 25% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. 0.1 ml of a lysozyme solution (10 mg/ml in 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was then added. After 5 min at room temperature, 0.8 ml of the lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 37 mM Na-EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was added, and the suspension was vortexed for 10 s twice, followed by a quick freezing in liquid N2 and thawing of the sample in a 37°C bath. The lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 25 min, and Ub-X-DHFRha (this term denotes both Ub-X-eK-DHFRha and Ub-X-Δe-DHFRha; Fig. 1) in the supern atant was bound to the monoclonal anti-ha antibody 12CA5 (Field et al., 1988; Johnson et al., 1992), added as an ascitic fluid, in a roughly 100-fold molar excess over Ub-X-DHFRha. The antibody-bound Ub-X-DHFRha was immobilized on a 0.5-ml column of protein A-Sepharose (Repligen, Cambridge, MA). The column was washed with 5 ml of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Ub-X-DHFRha was eluted with 2.5 M LiCl in the same buffer. The sample was dialyzed overnight against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, then concentrated by dialysis for ~20 h against 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tri s-HCl, pH 7.5, and stored at −20°C. The specific radioactivity of 35S-labeled Ub-X-DHFRha was ~104 cpm/μg. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford (Coomassie Blue) assay (Pierce). Ub-DHFR fusions purified as described above were conformationally unperturbed in that they could be retained on an MTX-Sepharose column (Pierce). Rabbit reticulocytes were purchased from Green Hectares (Oregon, WI) and shipped overnight on ice. ATP-depleted reticulocyte extract was prepared as described by Gonda et al.(1989) and stored as 0.2-ml samples in liquid N2. Only once-frozen samples were used in all experiments. An assay mixture contained 75 μl of the extract, 10 μl of an 35S-labeled Ub-X-DHFRha, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system (10 mM creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase). Assays were performed as follows. A reaction mixture complete except for ATP and the ATP-regenerating system was incubated for 10 min at 37°C to allow for the deubiquitination of a Ub-X-DHFRha fusion protein; an aliquot was then withdrawn (time zero in Fig. 2 and 3), ATP and an ATP-regenerating system were added to start ATP-dependent reactions in the extract, and the incubation continued at 37°C. The initial concentration of an 35S-labeled Ub-X-DHFRha in the extract was ~5 μg/ml; control experiments (not shown) indicated that this concentration was not rate-limiting for the degradation of either Arg-eK-DHFRha or Arg-Δe-DHFRha. MTX (where indicated) was added from a 2 M stock solution in 0.2 M NaOH to Ub-X-DHFRha in a reaction tube and incubated for 5 min at 0°C before assembling the reaction mixture as described above. The final MTX concentration was 20 μM. Two equal samples were withdrawn from reaction tubes at the times indicated in the legends to Figure 2:, Figure 3:. One sample was assayed for the amount of 5% trichloroacetic acid-soluble 35S, and the other was examined by a Tricine buffer-based SDS-PAGE (9% acrylamide, 0.24% bisacrylamide) (Schägger and Jagow, 1987). The gels were analyzed using fluorography or PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Trichloroacetic acid-soluble 35S was determined as follows. 0.1 ml of a solution of bovine serum albumin (50 mg/ml) was added to a 10-μl sample; 0.11 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid was then added; the sample was incubated on ice for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. 35S in the supernatant was determined using a water-compatible scintillation mixture and a scintillation counter. In each of the graphs of Fig. 3, the amount of trichloroacetic acid-soluble 35S in a zero-point sample (before the addition of ATP; 5-10% of total 35S) was subtracted from the values for samples withdrawn at later times. Linear Ub fusions are rapidly cleaved in vivo or in cell-free extracts after the last residue of Ub, making possible the production of otherwise identical proteins bearing different N-terminal residues (Bachmair et al., 1986; Baker et al., 1992). In one application of this method, Gonda et al. (1989) incubated fusions of Ub to E. coli β-galactosidase (Ub-X-βgal) in reticulocyte extract, producing X-βgal test proteins bearing different N-termina l residues. Depending on the identity of a residue X, an X-βgal is either short-lived or metabolically stable in ATP-supplemented extract (Gonda et al., 1989), similar to the in vivo findings with the same X-βgals in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Bachmair et al., 1986). Mutational analysis has shown that either one of two lysines (Lys-15 or Lys-17) in a non-βgal N-terminal region of an X-βgal test protein was also required for rap id degradation of X-βgal by the N-end rule pathway (Fig. 1) (Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989; Johnson et al., 1990). The function of these lysines was revealed by the finding that Lys-15 or, alternatively, Lys-17, is the site of formation of a multi-Ub chain (Chau et al., 1989). The non-βgal, ~40-residue extension at the N terminus of βgal was derived in part from an internal sequence of E. coli Lac repressor (Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989). In the present work, the strategy used by Gonda et al. (1989) with βgal-based substrates was employed to examine the degradation of similarly designed DHFR-based substrates by the N-end rule pathway in reticulocyte extract. The ~40-residue N-terminal extension of DHFR, derived from X-βgal test proteins (Fig. 1) (Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989), is denoted below as eK (extension (e) containing lysine (K)) (Johnson et al., 1992). In the constructs of Fig. 1, the C terminus of Ub-X-eK-DHFR was extended with a 14-residue sequence containing ha, an epitope tag derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin, which could be recognized by a monoclonal antibody (Field et al., 1988; Johnson et al., 1992). Two fusion proteins, Ub-Met-eK-DHFRha and Ub-Arg-eK-DHFRha (Fig. 1), bore, respectively, Met and Arg, a stabilizing and a destabilizing residue at the junction between Ub and the rest of a fusion (Varshavsky, 1992). These proteins were overexpressed in E. coli, labeled in vivo with [35S]methionine, and purified by affinity chromatography, using anti-ha antibody (see “Materials and Methods”). Ub-Met-eK-DHFRha and Ub-Arg-eK-DHFRha were rapidly deubiquitinated upon addition to ATP-depleted reticulocyte extract, yielding, respectively, Met-eK-DHFRha and Arg-eK-DHFRha (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes a and b), analogous to the previously characterized deubiquitination of Ub-X-eK-βgal fusions under the same conditions (Gonda et al., 1989). Both Met-eK-DHFRha and Arg-eK-DHFRha remained metabolically stable in ATP-depleted extract (data not shown), but the addition of ATP resulted in a much faster degradation of Arg-eK-DHFRha than Met-eK-DHFRha, which remained long lived in ATP-supplemented extract (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes b-e, and Fig. 3A). The metabolic fates of DHFR-based test proteins were monitored by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) and also by measuring the amount of acid-soluble 35S released during the incubation of an 35S-labeled protein in ATP-supplemented extract (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3A, 33% of the initially present 35S-labeled Arg-eK-DHFRha was degraded to acid-soluble fragments in ATP-supplemented reticulocyte extract after a 30-min incubation. By contrast, only 6% of the otherwise identical Met-eK-DHFRha, bearing an N-terminal Met (stabilizing residue in the N-end rule), was degraded after a 30-min incubation (Fig. 3A). Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed a transient accumulation of multiply ubiquitinated Arg-eK-DHFRha derivatives and a decrease in intensity of the band of unmodified Arg-eK-DHFRha in the course of its incubation in ATP-supplemented extract (Fig. 2B). By contrast, Met-eK-DHFRha was neither ubiquitinated nor significantly degraded in ATP-supplemented extract (Fig. 2A), in agreement with the findings about similarly designed X-βgal substrates (Gonda et al., 1989). Previous work has shown that an amino acid derivative such as a dipeptide that bears a destabilizing N-terminal residue can inhibit the degradation of a βgal-based N-end rule substrate either in vitro (reticulocyte extract) (Gonda et al., 1989) or in vivo (yeast cells) (Baker and Varshavsky, 1991). As shown in Fig. 2C and Fig. 3A, the degradation of a DHFR-based N-end rule substrate such as Arg-eK-DHFRha in reticulocyte extract was almost completely inhibited by the Arg-Ala dipeptide. Dipeptides bearing destabilizing N-terminal residues inhibit the N-end rule pathway by competing with N-end rule substrates for binding to N-recognin (Reiss et al., 1988; Gonda et al., 1989; Baker and Varshavsky, 1991). Arg-Ala not only precluded the degradation of Arg-eK-DHFRha (Fig. 3A) but also inhibited its ubiquitination (Fig. 2C), indicating that Arg-Ala blocks a step in the N-end rule pathway which precedes the ubiquitination step. We asked whether the folate analog MTX, a high affinity DHFR ligand (Kd of ~10−11M) and a competitive inhibitor of DHFR (Matthews et al., 1985), would affect the degradation of a DHFR-based N-end rule substrate. Remarkably, the presence of MTX in ATP-supplemented reticulocyte extract resulted in a nearly complete inhibition of Arg-eK-DHFRha degradation (Fig. 3A). The inhibitory effect of MTX was confined to the actual proteolysis of Arg-eK-DHFRha: its multiubiquitination was in fact enhanced by MTX, in contrast to the effect of Arg-Ala, which inhibited both the degradation and ubiquitination of Arg-eK-DHFRha (Fig. 2D; compare with Fig. 2C). We also determined the effect of MTX on degradation of Arg-Δe-DHFRha (derived from Ub-Arg-Δe-DHFRha), which lacked most of the ~40-residue, lysine-containing eK extension of Arg-eK-DHFRha (Fig. 1). Previous work ha s shown that Arg-Δe-DHFRha is much longer lived than Arg-eK-DHFRha in the yeast S. cerevisiae at 30°C (t½ of more than 4 h versus ~10 min, respectively); it has also been shown that a major reason for the increased metabolic stability of Arg-Δe-DHFRha is the absence of Lys-15 and Lys-17 residues: Arg-eΔK-DHFRha, which contains Arg instead of Lys at positions 15 and 17 of the otherwise unaltered eK extension, is nearly as long-lived in yeast as Arg-Δe-DHFRha (Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989). In a qualitative agreement with these in vivo data, Arg-Δe-DHFRha was degraded more slowly than Arg-eK-DHFRha in ATP-supplemented reticulocyte extract (Fig. 3B). The degradation of Arg-Δe-DHFRha was mediated by the N-end pathway, inasmuch as Met-Δe-DHFRha, bearing a stabilizing N-terminal residue, was degraded at a much lower rate than Arg-Δe-DHFRha (data not shown). Similarly to the findings with Arg-eK-DHFRha (Fig. 2D and Fig. 3A), the addition of MTX almost completely inhibited the degradation of Arg-Δe-DHFRha in ATP-supplemented reticulocyte extract (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the extensive ubiquitination of Arg-eK-DHFRha prior to its degradation (Fig. 2, B and D), the degradation of Arg-Δe-DHFRha was not accompanied by a significant accumulation of its multiubiquitinated derivatives, and no enhancement of multiubiquitination of Arg-Δe-DHFRha could be detected in the presence of MTX as well (Fig. 2E). The effect of MTX was confined to DHFR-based substrates: in parallel assays with βgal-based N-end rule substrates such as Arg-eK-βgal (Gonda et al., 1989), the addition of MTX did not alter the kinetics of Arg-eK-βgal degradation (data not shown). The MTX-DHFR assay has been used previously to address the mechanistic and kinetic aspects of protein translocation across membranes (Eilers and Schatz, 1986, 1988; Vestweber and Schatz, 1988; Wienhues et al., 1991; Arkowitz et al., 1992). The present work extends the applications of MTX-DHFR to the problem of Ub-dependent protein degradation. We report the following results. 1) Arg-eK-DHFRha (Fig. 1) is degraded by the N-end rule pathway in ATP-supplemented reticulocyte extract in the absence but not in the presence of MTX, a folic acid analog and a competitive inhibitor of DHFR which binds to mammalian DHFRs with a Kd of ~10−11M (Fig. 3A). 2) The effect of MTX is confined to DHFR-based substrates, in that the degradation of other N-end rule substrates such as Arg-eK-βgal is not inhibited by MTX. 3) The degradation of Arg-eK-DHFRha (this work) and other N-end rule substrates (Gonda et al., 1989) in reticulocyte extract is highly processive: no degradation intermediates could be detected by SDS-PAGE in the course of proteolysis. 4) MTX inhibits the degradation but not ubiquitination of Arg-eK-DHFRha, whose multiubiquitinated derivatives become more abundant in the presence of MTX (Fig. 2D). Previous work (Chau et al., 1989; Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989) has shown that the degradation of N-end rule substrates such as Arg-eK-βgal and Arg-eK-DHFRha requires (and is preceded by) the formation of a multi-Ub chain linked to one of two lysines (Lys-15 or Lys-17) in the ~40-residue extension (eK) at the N terminus of Arg-eK-DHFRha. 5) Arg-Δe-DHFRha, which lacks the eK extension, is also degraded (at a lower rate than Arg-eK-DHFRha) by the N-end rule pathway in reticulocyte extract, and this degradation is also inhibited by MTX (Fig. 3B). Only traces of multiubiquitinated Arg-Δe-DHFRha derivatives were observed during its degradation by the N-end rule pathway, and the relative content of these derivatives was further decreased in the presence of MTX (Fig. 2E and data not shown). The extensive ubiquitination of Arg-eK-DHFRha prior to its degradation indicates that ubiquitination is not rate-limiting for the degradation of Arg-eK-DHFRha in reticulocyte extract. By contrast, the scarcity of ubiquitinated derivatives of Arg-Δe-DHFRha suggests that ubiquitination of Arg-Δe-DHFRha is among the slowest steps that precede its degradation by the N-end rule pathway. A likely explanation for these differences between Arg-eK-DHFRha and Arg-Δe-DHFRha is the difference in locations of multi-Ub chains attached to these substrates: in Arg-eK-DHFRha, a multi-Ub chain is linked to one of the sterically accessible lysines (Lys-15 or Lys-17) in a flexible N-terminal extension (eK) located outside of the folded DHFR globule (Fig. 1) (Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989). By contrast, in the case of Arg-Δe-DHFRha a multi-Ub chain must form on one of the numerous but relatively immobile and (presumably) unfavorably located lysines of the folded DHFR globule (Dohmen et al., 1994), thus accounting for both the lower overall rate of Arg-Δe-DHFRha degradation and the low steady-state content of its ubiquitinated derivatives. This interpretation also accounts for the observed difference in the effect of MTX on the relative abundance of multiubiquitinated Arg-eK-DHFRha and Arg-Δe-DHFRha. Indeed, a block to Arg-eK-DHFRha degradation due to a conformational stabilization of its DHFR moiety by MTX would not be expected to perturb the formation of a multi-Ub chain linked to the eK extension of DHFR, as observed. By contrast, a multi-Ub chain linked to Arg-Δe-DHFRha has to form on a lysine of the folded DHFR moiety. This is a slow step, whose rate is further decreased in the presence of MTX, which stabilizes the conformation of DHFR (Matthews et al., 1985; Eilers and Schatz, 1988). (It is assumed that the rate of formation of a multi-Ub chain linked to Arg-Δe-DHFRha is limited by the rate of chain initiation at one of the lysines of DHFR.) A model that accounts for the findings of this work and is consistent with other evidence is shown in Fig. 4. A major assumption is that the initiation of processive degradation of an N-end rule substrate such as Arg-eK-DHFRha requires at least a local conformational perturbation of the folded DHFR moiety which can be “utilized” by the proteasome. The probability of this perturbation would be decreased in the presence of MTX, which stabilizes the folded conformation of DHFR. Since MTX inhibits the degradation but not multiubiquitination of Arg-eK-DHFRha, the relevant conformational perturbation must be a step that occurs after but not before the ubiquitination step (Fig. 4). It is not specified whether this “sufficient” perturbation of DHFR is a thermally driven fluctuation or is at least in part the result of DHFR interactions with components of the N-end rule pathway, including a DHFR-linked multi-Ub chain; the model is consistent with either possibility. Another assumption of the model is that an interaction between a ubiquitinated Arg-eK-DHFRha substrate and the proteasome-based proteolytic machine is reversible, in that a substrate-proteasome complex dissociates (or enters a state that cannot result in proteolysis; see below) after a stochastically determined time interval (Fig. 4). Given these assumptions, the near cessation of degradation of DHFR-based N-end rule substrates in the presence of MTX is explained as follows. In the absence of MTX, the mean time interval between the formation of a substrate-proteasome complex and a relevant conformational perturbation of DHFR within the complex is either close to or shorter than the mean lifetime of the complex. In the presence of MTX, its binding to DHFR (and the resulting conformational stabilization of the DHFR globule) decreases the probability of a relevant perturbation of DHFR within the substrate-proteasome complex but does not influence the mean lifetime of the complex (Fig. 4). Specifically, the time interval before perturbation of the substrate is postulated to become significantly longer than the time interval before dissociation of the substrate-proteasome complex, resulting in abortive cycles of targeting and multiubiquitination but little net degradation of a DHFR-based N-end rule substrate, as observed. The understanding of proteasome mechanics is still rudimentary, and therefore the model of Fig. 4 is vague about details of the MTX effect. To cite just one example, the postulated “dissociation” of a substrate-proteasome complex may actually be less than a complete dissociation: for the model to be relevant, it is sufficient that the complex can enter a state in which the proteasome becomes unable to initiate the degradation of a DHFR-based substrate upon an otherwise sufficient perturbation of DHFR. The degradation of DHFR-based N-end rule substrates in vivo (in S. cerevisiae cells) was found to be at most weakly inhibited by the addition of MTX to the growth medium. 2J. Johnston and A. Varshavsky, unpublished data. However, in contrast to the above in vitro assays (Figure 2:, Figure 3:), in which the N-end rule pathway targets a previously synthesized, folded DHFR, in the in vivo assays the binding of MTX to a nascent DHFR-based substrate takes place in kinetic competition with the targeting of the same substrate by the N-end rule pathway. Moreover, while the binding of MTX requires the folded DHFR conformation, the targeting by the N-end rule pathway is expected to occur at any time after the (cotranslational) formation of a destabilizing residue at the N terminus of a substrate. A strategy in which the N-end rule pathway is repressed at first (in a specially constructed yeast strain) and then induced should eliminate the above kinetic competition and allow the effects of MTX to be tested in vivo under conditions in which a DHFR-based substrate is folded and MTX-bound before it is targeted by the N-end rule pathway. These experiments are in progress. Interestingly, the in vivo degradation of a DHFR-based N-end rule substrate whose DHFR moiety was fused to an unrelated protein such as S. cerevisiae Cdc28p (Dohmen et al., 1994) could be inhibited by MTX, in contrast to the degradation of an otherwise identical substrate lacking the Cdc28p domain.2 The role of a DHFR-linked protein in conferring the sensitivity to inhibition by MTX remains to be understood. The ability to suppress the in vivo degradation of a short lived protein with its cell-penetrating, low Mr ligand would have a number of applications, including the possibility of constructing new types of conditional mutants (Dohmen et al., 1994). We thank David Gonda (Yale University) for helpful discussions, and members of this laboratory, especially Nils Johnsson and Michel Ghislain, for comments on the manuscript."

https://openalex.org/W2061672889,"To investigate the function of protein kinase C (PKC)-delta, we mutated its ATP binding site by converting the invariant lysine in the catalytic domain (amino acid 376) to an arginine. Expression vectors containing wild type and mutant PKC-delta cDNAs were generated either with or without an influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope tag. After expression in 32D cells by transfection, the PKC-delta ATP binding mutant (PKC-delta K376R) was not able to phosphorylate itself or the PKC-delta pseudosubstrate region-derived substrate, indicating that PKC-delta K376R was an inactive enzyme. PKC activity was inhibited by 67% in 32D cells coexpressing both PKC-delta wild type (PKC-delta WT) and PKC-delta K376R when compared to 32D cells expressing only PKC-delta WT. Mixture of PKC-delta WT and PKC-delta K376R kinase sources in vitro also reduced the enzymatic activity of PKC-delta WT. These results suggest that PKC-delta K376R competes with PKC-delta WT and inhibits PKC-delta WT phosphorylation of its in vitro substrate. While PKC-delta WT overexpressed in 32D cells demonstrated 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-dependent translocation from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction, PKC-delta K376R was exclusively localized in the membrane fraction even prior to TPA stimulation. Unlike PKC-delta WT which was phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s) only after TPA treatment, PKC-delta K376R was constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s). Although exposure of PKC-delta WT transfectants to TPA induced 32D monocytic differentiation, the 32D/PKC-delta K376R transfectants were resistant to TPA-induced differentiation. Thus, expression of active PKC-delta is required to mediate 32D monocytic differentiation in response to TPA stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2054320739,"The structure-activity relationship of casein kinase 2 (CK2) was examined with regard to its previously reported property to self-aggregate in vitro. Sedimentation velocity and electron microscopy studies showed that the purified kinase exhibited four major, different oligomeric forms in aqueous solution. This self-polymerization was a reproducible and fully reversible process, highly dependent upon the ionic strength of the medium, suggesting that electrostatic interactions are mostly involved. At high salt concentrations (e.g. 0.5 M NaCl), CK2 appears as spherical moieties with a 18.7 ± 1.6 nm average diameter, roughly corresponding to the α2β2 protomer, as deduced by measurements of the Stokes radius and by light scattering studies. At lower ionic strength (e.g. 0.2 M NaCl), the protomers associate to form ring-like structures with a diameter (averaging 36.6 ± 2.1 nm) and Stokes radius indicating that they are most likely made of four circularly associated α2β2 protomers. At 0.1 M NaCl, two additional polymeric structures were visualized: thin filaments (16.4 ± 1.4 nm average), as long as 1 to 5 μm, and thick and shorter filaments (28.5 ± 1.6 nm average). Examination of the molecular organization of CK2 under different catalytic conditions revealed that the ring-like structure is the favored conformation adopted by the enzyme in the presence of saturating concentrations of substrates and cofactors. During catalysis, well-known cofactors like MgCl2 or spermine are the main factors governing the stabilization of the active ring-like structure. On the other hand, inhibitory high salt concentrations promote the dissociation of the active ring-like structure into protomers. Such observations suggest a strong correlation between the ring-like conformation of the enzyme and optimal specific activity. Thus, CK2 may be considered as an associating-dissociating enzyme, and this remarkable property supports the hypothesis of a cooperative and allosteric regulation of the kinase in response to appropriate regulatory ligands possibly taking place in intact cells.

At high salt concentrations (e.g. 0.5 M NaCl), CK2 appears as spherical moieties with a 18.7 ± 1.6 nm average diameter, roughly corresponding to the α2β2 protomer, as deduced by measurements of the Stokes radius and by light scattering studies. At lower ionic strength (e.g. 0.2 M NaCl), the protomers associate to form ring-like structures with a diameter (averaging 36.6 ± 2.1 nm) and Stokes radius indicating that they are most likely made of four circularly associated α2β2 protomers. At 0.1 M NaCl, two additional polymeric structures were visualized: thin filaments (16.4 ± 1.4 nm average), as long as 1 to 5 μm, and thick and shorter filaments (28.5 ± 1.6 nm average). Examination of the molecular organization of CK2 under different catalytic conditions revealed that the ring-like structure is the favored conformation adopted by the enzyme in the presence of saturating concentrations of substrates and cofactors. During catalysis, well-known cofactors like MgCl2 or spermine are the main factors governing the stabilization of the active ring-like structure. On the other hand, inhibitory high salt concentrations promote the dissociation of the active ring-like structure into protomers. Such observations suggest a strong correlation between the ring-like conformation of the enzyme and optimal specific activity. Thus, CK2 may be considered as an associating-dissociating enzyme, and this remarkable property supports the hypothesis of a cooperative and allosteric regulation of the kinase in response to appropriate regulatory ligands possibly taking place in intact cells. INTRODUCTIONCasein kinase 2 (CK2) 1The abbreviations used are: CK2casein kinase 2DTTdithiothreitolDLSdynamic light scatteringPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a ubiquitous serine-threonine protein kinase present in both soluble and nuclear extracts of eukaryotic cells(1Tuazon P.T.

Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9928-9936Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).CK2 exhibits several distinctive properties: it uses either ATP or GTP as the phosphate donor to phosphorylate serine or threonine residues in protein substrates. It is selectively inhibited by heparin(10Feige J.J. Pirollet F. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1982; 21: 101-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and it can be activated by naturally occurring polycationic compounds such as polyamines(12Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1983; 30: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Feige J.J. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Selmeci L. Brosnan M.E. Seiler N. Recent Progress in Polyamine Research. Vol. 13. Akademiai Kiado, Budapest1985: 181-190Google Scholar). Moreover, the kinase needs high concentrations of MgCl2 (20 mM) for optimal catalytic activity(24Cochet C. Job D. Pirollet F. Chambaz E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 658: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).In most animal species, CK2 has been isolated as a heterotetramer composed of three dissimilar subunits, i.e. α and α′ subunits of 35-44 kDa and β subunits of 24-29 kDa which associate to form α2β2, αα′β2, or α′2β2 native structures(14Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 762-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3319-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the respective roles of each subunit in the kinase activity and regulation remain poorly understood, it has been shown that the α and α′ subunits that are the products of different genes bear the catalytic site of the enzyme(16Hathaway G.M. Zoller M.J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11442-11446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. J. Biol.

The β subunit which is the target of kinase self-phosphorylation may be considered as regulatory component since it confers optimal activity to the holoenzyme (17Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and may influence its substrate specificity(20Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Biochemical studies with the purified enzyme have shown that the dissociation of the tetrameric structure of CK2 into its α and β subunits requires rather drastic denaturing conditions(17Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the tetrameric structure of CK2 has usually been examined under high salt conditions because it was observed early on that the enzyme aggregates at low salt concentrations(11Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1982; 21: 101-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 12Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1983; 30: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two reports have shown that the aggregation of CK2 from Drosophila(21Glover C.V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14349-14354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or from bovine heart (22Mamrack M.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 85: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) is an ordered process resulting in the generation of filamentary structures. This in vitro self-polymerization property appears of interest in view of its possible role in the regulation of CK2 activity in the intact cell.To examine the structure-activity relationship of CK2, we have recently expressed its subunits in the baculovirusdirected insect cell expression system. This approach provides a functional recombinant holoenzyme, as well as its isolated α and β subunits(23Filhol O. Cochet C. Wedegaertner P. Gill G.N. Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11133-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The present study reports that self-polymerization of recombinant Drosophila CK2 generates in vitro three different and well-defined polymeric forms. A characterization by electron microscopy and sucrose density gradient sedimentation analysis as well as by light scattering and gel filtration revealed that the generation of each form was a fully ordered and reversible process which was mostly dependent upon the ionic strength of the medium. In suboptimal conditions for catalysis, CK2 is heterogeneous and mainly composed of short thick filaments. By contrast, under optimal catalytic conditions, the enzyme exhibits a ring-like structure. These observations provide a correlation between the ring-like structure and high CK2 specific activity and strongly suggest that assembly as a specific quaternary structure is the form in which the kinase expresses its optimal activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham. The peptide substrate (RRREEETEEE) for CK2 was obtained from Neosystem Laboratory (Strasbourg, France). Spermine was obtained from Sigma.Preparation of Recombinant Casein Kinase 2Recombinant oligomeric CK2 from Drosophila melanogaster was overexpressed in Sf9 cells, purified to homogeneity as described previously(23Filhol O. Cochet C. Wedegaertner P. Gill G.N. Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11133-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and stored at −80°C in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 2% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 M NaCl.Velocity SedimentationLinear 5-25% (w/v) sucrose gradients were prepared in TD buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, supplemented with various components, as indicated in the figure legends. For each experiment, samples were incubated at 4°C in 0.1 ml of TD buffer for 2 h prior to loading. Gradients were centrifuged at 4°C for 3.5 h at 200,000 × g and fractionated by pipetting 200-μl aliquots. For each ionic condition, identical gradients were run using aldolase (8 S), catalase (11.2 S), and α2-macroglobulin (19 S) as sedimentation markers which were localized by the Bradford protein assay.Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisProteins were solubilized and boiled in Laemmli's sample buffer and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were revealed by silver staining.Casein Kinase 2 AssayCK2 activity was assayed using either casein or the synthetic peptide substrate (RRREEETEEE), as described previously(24Cochet C. Job D. Pirollet F. Chambaz E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 658: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Filhol O. Cochet C. Wedegaertner P. Gill G.N. Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11133-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Electron MicroscopyRecombinant CK2 (15 μg) was incubated for 2 h at 4°C in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 50% glycerol, and different NaCl concentrations. Samples were then sprayed onto a fresh mica surface using a vaporizer and rotary-shadowed under vacuum with tantalum/tungsten at an incidence angle of 10−15° to the horizontal. Replicas were coated with a 20-nm-thick supporting film of carbon. Electron micrographs were obtained under standard bright field imaging conditions using a Zeiss 10C microscope operating at 100 keV. Size determination was performed on at least 50 independent objects.Gel FiltrationA Sephadex S-300 gel filtration column was calibrated by using porcine thyroglobulin (Mr = 669,000, Stokes radius = 85.0 Å), ferritin (Mr = 440,000, Stokes radius = 61.0 Å), aldolase (Mr= 158,000, Stokes radius = 48.1 Å), bovine serum albumin (Mr = 67,000, Stokes radius = 35.5 Å) as standards. The void volume (V0) was estimated by elution of blue dextran 2000. Kav values for standards were calculated from their elution volumes (Ve) by the equation: Kav = (Ve - V0)/(Vt - V0) where Vt = the total column volume. CK2 (30 μg), preincubated for 2 h at 4°C in 0.4 M or 0.2 M NaCl, was applied to the column equilibrated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 2% glycerol containing either 0.4 or 0.2 M NaCl.Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)Recombinant CK2 (107 μg) was preincubated for 2 h at 4°C in 500 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing either 0.4 M NaCl or 0.2 M NaCl. DLS measurements were performed at 14.5°C using a system consisting of a BI 2030 AT 4*N-bit autocorrelator with real-time channels and multiple sample time option (Brookhaven Instruments), a stepping motor goniometer (Amtec, Nice, France), and a Spectra-Physics 2025 argon ion laser. The incident laser power was 500 milliwatts at 488 nm. DLS autocorrelation functions were collected through an angular range of 40° to 90°. The data were analyzed by either a maximum entropy procedure which directly yields the particle size distribution (25Langowski J. Bryan R. Lindner P. Zmb T. Neutron, X-Ray and Light Scattering. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York1991: 325-347Google Scholar) or a non linear least-squares fit to a squared sum of exponentials. The diffusion coefficients Dt were obtained through Dt = (K2τ)−2, K being the scattering vector and τ the relaxation time. Dt was corrected to 20°C by Dt· = Dt•(293/T)•(ηw,T/ηw,20°), T being the absolute temperature, and ηw,T the viscosity of water at T.Determination of CK2 Specific ActivityThe kinase assay contains a reaction volume of 100 μl containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.2 mg/ml casein, 10 μM ATP, 1 mM MgCl2, variable [γ-32P]ATP concentrations to obtain appropriate γ-32P incorporation, and 0.2 M NaCl. Various amounts of recombinant CK2 and recombinant α subunit were preincubated in the kinase assay medium at room temperature for 2 min, and the reactions were started by addition of magnesium. For each condition, a time course study was performed to check the linearity of the reaction. Materials used in these experiments were siliconized, then saturated with a solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 2% glycerol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin prior to use.RESULTSMolecular Forms of CK2 in Aqueous Solution under Low and High Salt ConcentrationsHomogeneous recombinant Drosophila CK2 was analyzed by velocity sedimentation through a sucrose gradient containing either 0.1 M or 1 M NaCl (Fig. 1). Aliquots of the collected fractions were analyzed for CK2 activity (Fig. 1A) and by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, B and C). In the presence of 1 M NaCl, the enzyme sedimented as a single peak with a 6 S sedimentation coefficient which is the value expected for the α2β2 holoenzyme, further referred to as the CK2 protomer. By contrast, at 0.1 M NaCl, the enzyme exhibited a polydisperse distribution. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, a continuum of species having sedimentation coefficients ranging from 13.6 S to 47 S could be visualized. Examination of fractions showing CK2 activity by SDS-PAGE shows that both α and β subunits are present with a similar stoichiometry all along the sucrose gradients (Fig. 1, B and C). Therefore, the sedimentation behavior of the recombinant CK2 is strongly dependent upon the ionic strength of the medium. In addition, the heavy forms of CK2 occurring at low ionic strength contain both the α and the β subunits of the kinase, with a stoichiometry identical with that observed for the protomer (α2β2). This suggests that these heavy forms are generated by protomer association.The recombinant CK2 was then analyzed by electron microscopy using replicas produced by low-angle rotary shadowing with tantalum/tungsten. Electron micrographs of CK2 incubated in buffer containing either 1 M or 0.1 M NaCl are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. As expected from the sedimentation data, a homogeneous population made of roughly circular structures with an average diameter of 18.7 ± 1.6 nm was observed at high salt concentrations, consistent with the CK2 protomer (Fig. 2A). By contrast, four different structural organizations of the protein could be visualized in 0.1 M NaCl (Fig. 2B). 1) Some rare 18.7 ± 1.6 nm diameter particles (Fig. 2B, panel 1). 2) Roughly round structures with an average diameter of 36.6 ± 2.1 nm and usually showing in their center a pronounced decrease of the metal density (Fig. 2B, panel 1). This structure will be referred to as the “ring-like” structure. 3) Thin filaments with a uniform average width of 16.4 ± 1.4 nm and variable lengths (up to 5 μm) (Fig. 2B, panel 2). 4) Thick filaments of about 28.5 ± 1.6 nm width (Fig. 2B, panel 3). These structures are all derived from different associations of the α2β2 protomer, which self-assembles when the ionic strength of the medium is lowered.Figure 2:Electron microscopy of recombinant CK2 in 0.1 M and 1 M NaCl. Purified recombinant Drosophila CK2 (15 μg) was incubated for 2 h at 4°C in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 50% glycerol, containing either 1 M or 0.1 M NaCl. Samples were then prepared for electron microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bars = 100 nm. A, recombinant CK2 in 1 M NaCl. B, recombinant CK2 in 0.1 M NaCl. C, gallery of selected images of different molecular forms of CK2 in 0.1 M NaCl.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The behavior of the isolated α subunit was also examined by electron microscopy under high and low salt conditions. It always appeared on electron micrographs as an homogeneous population of spherical structures (data not shown) indicating that the β subunit is required in the CK2 self-polymerization process.Molecular Forms of CK2 as a Function of Ionic StrengthTo examine in more detail how the self-polymerization of the kinase takes place as a function of ionic strength, velocity sedimentation and electron microscopy analysis of CK2 were carried out in parallel, under different salt concentrations. In 0.4 M NaCl, the enzyme sedimented as a single peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 6 S (Fig. 3B, panel e). Electron microscopy imaging showed that under these conditions the enzyme appears as a homogeneous population of condensed spherical structures, with a size fitting well with an α2β2 protomeric form of the protein (Fig. 3A, panel a). Decrease of the NaCl concentration to 0.3 M resulted in the occurrence of a new peak of CK2 activity with a sedimentation coefficient of 13.6 S (Fig. 3B, panel f). In addition to the presence of protomers, the corresponding electron micrographs disclosed a population of ring-like structures (Fig. 3A, panel b). The occurrence of ring-like structures may reflect the beginning of a transition suggesting that 0.3 M NaCl represents a threshold salt concentration below which ring-like structure formation is favored. Indeed, in 0.2 M NaCl, the enzyme sedimented as a homogeneous peak with a 13.6 S sedimentation coefficient (Fig. 3B, panel g). Electron micrographs showed that the ring-like structure represented the most prominent form of the enzyme at this salt concentration (Fig. 3A, panel c). Lowering the NaCl concentration to 0.1 M resulted in an enzyme sedimentation pattern further in the sucrose gradient reflecting a polydisperse distribution from 15 to 44 S and a pelleted form (Fig. 3B, panel h). Electron microscopy examination of these two populations revealed that the corresponding molecular forms of CK2 were characterized by the occurrence of thick and thin filaments (Fig. 3A, panel d).Figure 3:Electron microscopy and velocity sedimentation of CK2 as a function of ionic conditions. Purified recombinant Drosophila CK2 (15 μg) was preincubated for 2 h at 4°C in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 50% glycerol, and 0.4 M (a), 0.3 M (b), 0.2 M (c), 0.1 M (d) NaCl, and prepared for electron microscopy, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In parallel, purified recombinant Drosophila CK2 (1.5 μg) was preincubated for 2 h at 4°C in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, and 0.4 M (e), 0.3 M (f), 0.2 M (g), 0.1 M (h) NaCl, and sedimented through a 5-25% sucrose gradient under the same salt conditions. Gradients were fractionated and kinase activity was measured in each fraction. Bars = 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To cross-check these results, electron microscopy analysis was carried out directly on isolated fractions recovered following gradient centrifugation and representing the different self-assembled CK2 populations. For these experiments, a glycerol gradient equivalent to the 5-25% sucrose gradient was used since sucrose was not compatible with the shadowing procedure used to prepare the specimens for microscopy. In total agreement with the results illustrated in Fig. 3, we observed that the enzyme sedimenting at 13.6 S corresponded mostly to the ring-like structure (Fig. 4). Thick filaments were the most abundant in the large intermediary peak (15 to 44 S), and long thin filaments were mainly detected in the fractions sedimenting at the bottom of the tube. Unorganized aggregates were also observed at the bottom of the tube.Figure 4:Electron microscopic analysis of the different molecular forms of CK2 separated on a glycerol gradient. Recombinant Drosophila CK2 (75 μg) was preincubated 2 h at 4°C in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1 M NaCl, then sedimented under the same salt condition on a 8-41% glycerol gradient. The gradient was fractionated and the kinase activity was measured in each fraction. Then selected fractions were used for electron microscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We found that all the polymeric structures of the enzyme could be dissociated with NaCl concentrations higher than 0.4 M NaCl (not shown). Thus, the self-polymerization of CK2 is readily reversible in the appropriate ionic strength environment.Relationship between the Different Molecular Forms of CK2We further characterized the structure of the protomer and the ring-like structure by gel filtration and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis under two ionic strength conditions (0.4 M and 0.2 M NaCl, respectively). The major physical characteristics obtained for the different CK2 molecular forms are given in Table 1. Apparent molecular masses of 669 kDa and 158 kDa were determined by gel filtration analysis for the ring-like structure and the protomer, respectively. From the Stokes radius calculated from the DLS data, and the sedimentation coefficients from the sucrose gradient centrifugation, it was possible to determine molecular sizes of 524 kDa and 129 kDa for the ring-like and the protomeric structures, respectively. With both techniques, the ratio between the apparent molecular masses of these two forms of the enzyme was very close to 4. A similar observation could be made for the Stokes radius determined by the two independent techniques (Table 1). Higher magnification electron micrographs showing CK2 ring-like structures is illustrated in Fig. 5(panel Aa). Together with dimensional criteria (i.e. an average diameter of 36.6 ± 2.1 nm for these particles as compared to 18.7 ± 1.6 nm for the protomer), these data suggest that the ring-like structural organization of CK2 is formed by the circular association of α2β2 protomers. The data are compatible with the idea that the ring-like structure represents a tetramer of the kinase protomers, i.e. (α2β2)4 interacting side by side on a plane.Table I Open table in a new tab Figure 5:Structural relationship between the different molecular forms of CK2. Recombinant Drosophila CK2 (15 μg) was preincubated for 2 h at 4°C in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 50% glycerol, and 0.1 M NaCl and prepared for electron microscopy, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, gallery of selected images of CK2 polymers. B, drawings of the structures shown in A to assist interpretation of the photomicrographs. Bars = 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The morphology of the thick filaments suggests that they could result from a linear association of ring-like moieties (Fig. 5, panels Ab and Ac). If so, the ring-like structures must compact a little during association since the average width of the thick filaments (28.5 ± 1.6 nm) was slightly smaller than the diameter of the isolated ring-like structures (36.6 ± 2.1 nm). With regard to the thin filament organization, it may result from a linear association of protomers. In some cases, thin filaments appeared as if they were generated from thick filaments either by splitting (see Fig. 5, panel Ad) or by internal molecular rearrangement (see Fig. 2C, panel 4). On the other hand, thick filaments may result from the side by side association of thin filaments. We have no experimental evidence at the moment to clarify further the relationship between these different filamentary arrangements.Molecular Forms of CK2 and Catalytic ActivityThe four different types of CK2 structures isolated following ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradients were detected by their protein kinase activity (Fig. 3). We found that all the CK2 molecular forms assayed in the different sucrose gradient-collected fractions exhibited similar specific protein kinase activities. However, it should be stressed that the four different conformations of CK2 were isolated under a resting state (i.e. in the absence of any substrate), whereas the protein kinase activity was then determined in an assay medium under optimal catalytic conditions. This prompted us to examine the molecular forms of the kinase when placed under catalytic conditions.Molecular Organization of CK2 under Different Catalytic ConditionsOligomeric preparations of CK2 were analyzed on sucrose gradients containing 0.1 M NaCl in the absence or in the presence of 10 μM ATP, 150 μM peptide substrate and with either 1 mM or 20 mM MgCl2 (Fig. 6). As previously shown in Fig. 1, in the absence of substrates, the enzyme sedimented as a mixture of three major different polymerized structures: the ring-like structure, the thick, and the thin filaments. In the presence of substrates and 1 mM MgCl2 (i.e. in nonoptimal catalytic conditions), the CK2 polymerization pattern was changed. The number of thick filaments decreased dramatically whereas there were more ring-like structures. However, the CK2 population remained heterogeneous under these catalytic conditions. In contrast, in the presence of substrates and 20 mM MgCl2 (i.e. under optimal catalytic conditions), the enzyme sedimented strikingly as a sharp symmetrical peak with a sedimentation behavior (13.6 S) corresponding to that of the ring-like structure. Control experiments disclosed that during centrifugation, the peptide substrate present in the sucrose gradient was readily phosphorylated (not shown). These results strongly suggest that the ring-like structure of the kinase corresponds to the favored molecular organization of the protomers when the enzyme is optimally active during the catalytic reaction.Figure 6:Velocity sedimentation of CK2 under different catalytic conditions. Recombinant Drosophila CK2 (1.5 μg) was preincubated for 2 h at 4°C in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 M NaCl, then sedimented on a 5%:25% sucrose gradient in the same salt condition (▴ ) or containing 150 μM peptide substrate, 10 μM"
https://openalex.org/W2012355612,"Proteolytic enzymes such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), plasmin, and collagenase mediate proteolysis by a variety of tumor cells. uPA secreted by tumor cells can be bound to a cell surface receptor via a growth factor-like domain within the amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of the uPA molecule with high affinity. Urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) efficiently inhibits the soluble and the tumor cell-surface receptor-bound plasmin and subsequently reduces tumor cell invasion and the formation of metastasis. The anti-invasive effect is dependent on the anti-plasmin activity of the UTI molecule, domain II in particular. We synthesized a conjugate between ATF of human uPA and a native UTI molecule or domain II of UTI (HI-8). The effect of the conjugates (ATF.UTI or ATF.HI-8) on tumor cell invasion in vitro was investigated. ATF.UTI and ATF.HI-8 bound to U937 cells in a rapid, saturable, dose-dependent, and reversible manner. A large part of receptor-bound ATF-UTI and ATF.HI-8 remains on the cell surface for at least 5 h at 37 degrees C. Inhibition of tumor cell-surface receptor-bound plasmin by ATF.UTI and ATF.HI-8 was markedly enhanced when compared with tumor cells treated either with ATF, UTI, or HI-8. Results of a cell invasion assay showed that ATF.UTI and ATF.HI-8 is very effective at targeting HI-8 specifically to uPA receptor-expressing tumor cells, whereas tumor cells devoid of uPA receptor may be less affected by the conjugates. Our results indicate that cell surface uPA and plasmin activity is essential to the invasive process and that the conjugates exhibit plasmin inhibition to the close environment of the cell surface and subsequently inhibit the tumor cell invasion through Matrigel in an in vitro invasion assay."
https://openalex.org/W1983691297,"Stimulation of m1 and m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which are coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis and protein kinase C activation, has been shown to increase the release of soluble amyloid precursor protein derivatives (APPs). The effect is mimicked by phorbol esters, which directly activate protein kinase C. Using human embryonic kidney cells expressing individual muscarinic receptor subtypes, we found that stimulation of APPs release by the muscarinic agonist carbachol was only partially reduced by a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (the bisindolylmaleimide GF 109203X), while the response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was abolished. The increase in APPs release elicited by carbachol and PMA was accompanied by elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins and reduced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors; GF 109203X significantly reduced the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation by carbachol and PMA. Inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases by vanadyl hydroperoxide markedly increased cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced APPs release as effectively as PMA and carbachol. Direct phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein on tyrosine residues following treatment with carbachol, PMA, or vanadyl hydroperoxide was not observed. The results implicate both tyrosine phosphorylation and protein kinase C-dependent mechanisms in the regulation of APPs release by G protein-coupled receptors, and suggest that carbachol and PMA increase APPs release from human embryonic kidney cells expressing m3 muscarinic receptors via partially divergent pathways that converge at a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent step. Stimulation of m1 and m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which are coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis and protein kinase C activation, has been shown to increase the release of soluble amyloid precursor protein derivatives (APPs). The effect is mimicked by phorbol esters, which directly activate protein kinase C. Using human embryonic kidney cells expressing individual muscarinic receptor subtypes, we found that stimulation of APPs release by the muscarinic agonist carbachol was only partially reduced by a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (the bisindolylmaleimide GF 109203X), while the response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was abolished. The increase in APPs release elicited by carbachol and PMA was accompanied by elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins and reduced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors; GF 109203X significantly reduced the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation by carbachol and PMA.

Thus, a detailed analysis of the involvement of CREB in this synergism was undertaken in HepG2 cells. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrate that a CRE probe is bound by CREB present in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we show that a dominant repressor of CREB is able to significantly reduce the cAMP responsiveness of the PEPCK promoter in HepG2 cells. Finally, we demonstrate using a GAL4-CREB fusion protein that CREB is able to synergize with the liver-enriched factors bound upstream on the PEPCK promoter to mediate a liver-specific response to cAMP. Examination of several mutant forms of CREB allow us to conclude that the “synergy” domain of CREB resides within amino acid residues 83-203, and that residues 83-145 can mediate a partial synergistic response.

To identify the regions of UvrB which are involved in interacting with UvrA, UvrC, and DNA, deletion mutants, point mutants, and various fusion forms of UvrB were constructed and characterized. We found that the region encompassing amino acid residues 115-250 of UvrB binds to UvrA, while the region encompassing amino acid residues 547-673 binds to both UvrA and UvrC. In addition, the region between these two domains, which contains the helicase motifs II-VI, was found to be involved in binding to DNA. Within this DNA-binding region, two point mutants, E265A and E338A, were found to be unable to bind DNA while two residues, Phe-365 and Phe-496, were identified to interact with DNA.

In Escherichia coli, nucleotide excision repair is initiated by the (A)BC excinuclease which excises a wide variety of DNA damages in a dodecanucleotide (Sancar and Tang, 1993; Grossman and Thiagalingam, 1993). This activity results from the coordinated actions of the UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins. Specifically, UvrA is a damage recognition protein as well as a molecular matchmaker (Sancar and Hearst, 1993); it forms an A2B1 complex with UvrB and guides UvrB to a lesion in the DNA. Upon binding to the lesion, the DNA is bent by approximately 130° (Shi et al., 1992) and the area around the lesion is unwound by about 5 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)MBPmaltose-binding proteinTRCFtranscription-repair coupling factorT<>Tthymine cyclobutane dimerT<>HMTthymine-furanside monoadduct of 4′-hydroxymethyl-4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralenABPD2-aminobutyl-1,3-propanediolssDNA and dsDNAsingle- and double-stranded DNA, respectivelyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (Lin et al., 1992; Visse et al., 1994b). UvrA must then dissociate from the lesion before UvrC can bind to the UvrB-DNA complex to induce the dual incisions (Orren and Sancar, 1989, 1990; Visse et al., 1992). Upon binding of UvrC to the UvrB-DNA complex, UvrB makes the 3′ incision after which the 5′ incision is made by UvrC (Lin et al., 1992; Lin and Sancar, 1992). As evident from the ongoing presentation, UvrB is the central component of the entire excision repair process; it must interact with UvrA, bind specifically to damaged DNA, interact with UvrC, make the 3′ incision, and following the dual incisions, it must then interact with both helicase II and polymerase I to complete the repair process (Orren et al., 1992).

In the present study, we have investigated the structural basis for the multiple interactions of UvrB during nucleotide excision repair. By assaying deletion mutants, point mutants, and various fusion forms of this protein for protein-protein interaction, DNA binding, and excision activities, the UvrA, UvrC, and DNA-binding domains of UvrB have been identified. UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins were purified as described by Thomas et al.(1985). E. coli strains DR153 (recAl ΔuvrB)/F′lacIq and DR1984 (recA1 UvrC34)/F′lacIq were used as hosts for plasmids overproducing the mutant or wild-type proteins. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. Site-specific and deletion mutants of the uvrB gene were made by the method of Kunkel et al.(1987) using the Muta-gene M13 in vitro mutagenesis (Bio-Rad) Kit. The EcoRI-PstI fragment of pUNC211, which contained all but the first 21 bp of UvrB (Thomas et al., 1985), was cloned into M13 mp18 (New England Biolabs). Mutations were then generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and identified by single strand sequencing using the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemicals) and/or restriction enzyme digestions. After the mutated gene was cloned back into the expression plasmid pUNC211, mutant constructs were reconfirmed by double-strand DNA sequencing. Fusions of UvrB with the maltose-binding protein (MBP) were constructed by ligating different fragments of the uvrB gene into the pMAL-c2 expression vector (New England Biolabs). Briefly, a derivative of pUNC211, called pUNC211a, was constructed which introduced the restriction site for HincII, GTTAAC, at position 747 and a restriction site for HindIII, AAGCTT, at position 2072 of the uvrB gene (Arikan et al., 1986). Afterwards, three different fusion proteins of UvrB to MBP were constructed: MBP/UvrB(115-250), corresponding to amino acid residues 115-250 of UvrB, was made by cloning the HincII fragment of pUNC211a from positions 342 to 750 into the XmnI site of pMal-c2. MBP/UvrB(251-547), corresponding to residues 251-546 of UvrB, was made by cloning the HincII-EcoRV fragment of pUNC211a from positions 751 to 1783 into the XmnI site of pMal-c2. MBP/UvrB(547-673), corresponding to residues 547-673 of UvrB, was made by cloning the EcoRV-HindIII fragment of pUNC211a from positions 1784 to 2075 into the XmnI/HindIII site of pMal-c2. Fusion constructs were identified by restriction enzyme digestions. The fusion proteins were purified as follows. Single colonies of DR153 harboring the appropriate plasmid were inoculated in 500 ml of LB with the required antibiotics and grown at 30°C until an O.D. of 0.6 was reached. The culture was then induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside and grown for an additional 4 h. Afterwards cells were harvested and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% sucrose) per liter of culture. Cells were lysed by sonicating 10 × for 10 s each with a Branson Sonicator. The lysate was spun for 1 h at 40,000 × g at 4°C and the supernatant was loaded onto an amylose column equilibrated with Buffer B (100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) + 0.1 M KCl. The column was then washed with 5 column volume of Buffer B + 0.1 M KCl. Bound proteins were then eluted with 1 column volume of Buffer B + 0.1 M KCl + 10 mM maltose. Purified proteins were dialyzed and stored in storage buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol). Since fusion proteins were used for most of the studies to identify structural domains in UvrB it was essential to establish that these proteins were “well behaved” with regard to their solubility and quaternary structures. All of the constructs used were as soluble as the wild-type protein and those that were poorly soluble (e.g. MBP/UvrB(Δ114-120) and MBP/UvrB(Δ207-225) were only characterized genetically. In addition, the constructs used for biochemical studies behaved as monomers as determined by gel permeation chromatography under conditions employed to determine the oligomerization status of the wild-type protein. Thus, we conclude that the interactions we detect for the fusion constructs are intrinsic to the UvrB part of the fusions and are not compounded by competing interactions that arose from newly created protein interfaces. Protein-protein interactions between wild-type and mutant UvrBs and UvrA, and UvrC were detected by affinity chromatography. UvrA, UvrB, or UvrC proteins were covalently cross-linked to the Affi-Gel-10 resin as recommended by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). In general, a typical column contained 3-5 mg of protein per 500 μl of resin. The following procedure was then used to detect protein-protein interaction with purified proteins. 1.0 μg of the test protein (or cell-free extract from 1-32 ml of an appropriate culture) was loaded onto an affinity column that had been equilibrated with Binding Buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM ATP, and 20% glycerol) + 0.1 M KCl and washed with 10 column volumes of Binding Buffer + 0.1 M KCl at a flow rate of 2 ml/h. Bound fractions were then eluted with 2 column volumes of Binding Buffer + 0.5 M KCl. Fractions of 250 μl were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The binding of UvrB to DNA was quantified by gel retardation assays. Substrates tested were terminally labeled 12- or 13-nucleotide long oligomers containing either an unmodified base or a modified mono- or dinucleotide in the center. The following modified bases were tested: (i) thymine-monoadduct of 4′-hydroxymethyl-4,5′-8-trimethylpsoralen (T<>HMT): 5′-GCTCGG(T<>HMT)ACCCGG-3′; (ii) 1,2-d(GpG) cisplatin [cis-platinum(II)diammine dichloride] diadduct: 5′-TCTA(G G)CCTTCT-3′; (iii) synthetic “AP” site (2-aminobutyl-1,3-propanediol, ABPD): 5′-GAAGC(ABPD)ACGAGC-3′. The psoralen and cisplatin containing oligomers were kindly provided by Drs. John E. Hearst (University of California, Berkeley) and Stephen J. Lippard (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Oligomers without a modified base or with a synthetic AP site were obtained from Operon Biotechnologies. Binding assays of UvrB to these oligonucleotides were done as follows. 1 nM32P-labeled oligomers were incubated with increasing concentrations of UvrB at 22°C for 20 min in 50 μl of ABC buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). The reaction mixtures were then loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 80 V for 5 h at 4°C. Binding of UvrB to DNA was then quantified by AMBIS scanning. Since the binding of UvrB to DNA is of low affinity, the bound fraction does not always yield a sharp band; in fact, quite often it appears as a smear above the free (unbound) DNA. Thus, the fraction of DNA not in the band corresponding to free DNA was considered bound in our analysis. UvrB mutants containing a tryptophan residue at position 88, 107, 187, 216, 365, 496, or 527 were used to investigate DNA binding by fluorescence quenching. In these mutants, phenylalanine residues were individually replaced by tryptophans at the indicated positions (Phillips, 1994). Since wild-type UvrB does not contain any tryptophan, any fluorescence detected in these mutants is a result of the single amino acid replacement. Fluorescence quenching studies were done as follows: 3 μM mutant UvrB protein was incubated with 130 μM (in nucleotide) calf thymus DNA in 500 μl of ABC buffer for 5 min at 4°C. All spectras were taken with a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette at 15°C and measured with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm with a Shimadzu model RF5000U spectroflurometer. The proximity of the tryptophan residues, which were introduced into UvrB, to DNA was determined by the splitting of T<>T by the bound protein. A single strand 49-mer containing a centrally located T<>T (Svoboda et al., 1993) was terminally labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. 5.0 μM mutant proteins were incubated with 1.0 nM substrate in 250 μl of ABC buffer for 20 min at 22°C. The samples were then irradiated with 293 nm light in a Quantacount monocoromator at a fluence rate of 500 microwatts/cm2 for 30 min. The DNA was extracted with phenol/cholorform, ethanol precipitated, annealed with a 5-fold molar excess of the complementary strand, treated with MseI endonuclease, and then electrophoresed on a 12% denaturing gel. The photodimer is located within a MseI recognition sequence, T<>TAA; thus photoreversal of the dimer restores the susceptibility of this sequence to the restriction endonuclease (Li et al., 1993) and repair is measured by the extent of MseI digestion. Cross-linking of the UvrB protein to a psoralen-adducted oligomer was conducted as described previously (Orren et al., 1992) to investigate the binding of UvrB to DNA. Briefly, 1 nM32P-labeled 13-mer oligonucleotide with a psoralen adduct was incubated with 10 μM wild-type or mutant UvrB in 30 μl of ABC buffer for 20 min at 22°C. Then, the reaction mixture was irradiated for 30 min with 366 nm light from a Sylvania black lamp at a fluence rate of 3 milliwatts/cm2. The samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE and the level of cross-linking was estimated by autoradiography. A 137-mer duplex with a centrally located furanside thymine-psoralen monoadduct (T<>HMT) (Van Houten et al., 1987) was labeled with 32P at both termini on the damaged strand and used in an incision assay as described previously (Lin et al., 1992). Briefly, 1 nm of substrate, 5 nM UvrA, 80 nM UvrB, 40 nM UvrC, and 0.1 μg of unmodified pBR322 DNA were incubated in 25 μl of ABC buffer containing 2 mM ATP for 20 min at 37°C; the reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of a 1:1 mixture of 0.25 M EDTA and 5 mg/ml oyster glycogen, precipitated with 60 μl of ice-cold ethanol and analyzed on 8% denaturing gels. The incision products observed were a 66-mer representing the 5′ incision, a 60-mer representing the 3′ incision, and a 78-mer representing the 3′ uncoupled incision. Previous studies failed to detect any UvrB-UvrC interaction off DNA; therefore, it was assumed that UvrB, upon binding to damaged DNA, undergoes a conformational change which enables UvrC to bind to the UvrB-damaged DNA complex (Orren and Sancar, 1989). However, these studies employed hydrodynamic methods which are not practical for detecting weak protein-protein interactions between a large number of protein pairs. To study a possible, direct interaction between UvrB and UvrC, protein affinity columns of UvrB and UvrC were employed. When E. coli cell-free extract from a strain overproducing the UvrB protein was passed through the UvrC affinity column, the UvrB protein was retained on the column (Fig. 1A). However, in addition, RNA polymerase was also retained on the column with relatively high affinity raising some doubt about the specifity of binding. A control column without any cross-linked protein was used to further clarify the specificity of these bindings. UvrB did not bind to the control column, but some RNA Pol did (data not shown), suggesting that the binding of UvrB to the UvrC column is specific, while the binding of the subunits of RNA Pol to the UvrC column is primarily nonspecific. To further ascertain that the UvrB-UvrC interaction revealed by this assay was specific, E. coli cell-free extract from a strain overproducing the UvrC protein was passed through an UvrB affinity column. Fig. 1B shows that in this case, only the UvrC protein is retained on the column. Thus, we conclude that UvrB and UvrC do interact off DNA specifically, but with lower affinity than the UvrA-UvrB interaction, which can be easily detected by hydrodynamic methods. More importantly, since these columns were able to detect weak but specific protein-protein interactions, they were used subsequently to identify the UvrA and UvrC binding domains of UvrB. Protein sequence of the Mfd protein (transcription-repair coupling factor, TRCF) revealed a stretch of 137 amino acids which displayed a high degree of sequence homology to amino acid residues 115-250 of the UvrB protein (Selby and Sancar, 1993). Since both TRCF and UvrB bind to the UvrA protein, it was hypothesized that this region of homology may be involved in binding to UvrA. In addition, a screen for dominant negative uvrB− mutants generated by random mutagenesis yielded a mutant expressing only the amino-terminal half of UvrB (Moolenaar et al., 1994), further supporting the idea that residues 115-250 of UvrB binds to UvrA. To test these predictions and narrow down the binding site, a fusion of the maltose-binding protein with amino acid residues 115-250 of UvrB ((MBP/UvrB(115-250)) was constructed and applied to the UvrA and UvrC affinity columns. Fig. 2A shows that this fusion protein binds to the UvrA affinity column but not to the UvrC column, suggesting that this region of UvrB specifically interacts with UvrA. In addition, 4 deletion mutants of UvrB within this region were constructed (MBP/UvrB(Δ114-120), MBP/UvrB(Δ136-145), MBP/UvrB(Δ166-173), and MBP/UvrB(Δ207-225)) and tested for complementation in vivo. All these deletion mutants failed to complement a uvrB− mutation, presumably because of failure to bind to UvrA. However, these mutant proteins had low solubility and were not amenable to in vitro analysis. To identify the region of UvrB which binds to UvrC, two other MBP fusion proteins of UvrB were made. One, MBP/UvrB(251-546), was comprised of the so-called helicase motifs II-VI of UvrB, while the other, MBP/UvrB(547-673), consisted of the carboxyl-terminal 126 amino acids of UvrB. Analysis of these fusions using the UvrA and UvrC affinity columns revealed that MBP/UvrB(547-673) bound to the UvrC column (Fig. 2B) and interestingly enough, also bound to the UvrA column with an affinity comparable to that for the MBP/UvrB(115-250) fusion (Fig. 2, AversusB). Thus, it appears that while UvrC binds only to the carboxyl-terminal domain of UvrB, UvrA binds to both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains of UvrB, suggesting that the binding domains of UvrA and UvrC in the carboxyl-terminal half of UvrB may overlap. Furthermore, the UvrA- and UvrC- binding regions on UvrB appear to be restricted to the areas defined by these fusion proteins as MBP/UvrB(251-546) failed to bind to either the UvrA or UvrC affinity column (data not shown). It was previously believed that UvrB could not bind DNA by itself, but that upon loading of UvrB by UvrA onto DNA, a stable UvrB-DNA complex is formed (Orren and Sancar, 1989). However, when a 13-nucleotide long oligonucleotide with a psoralen adduct was mixed with the UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins, it was discovered that upon irradiation with 366 nm light, only UvrB became cross-linked to the psoralen adduct (Orren et al., 1992). This suggested that UvrB could perhaps interact with damaged DNA in the absence of UvrA. Thus, we decided to investigate the direct binding of UvrB to DNA in more detail. The cross-linking of UvrB to a 13-nucleotide long oligomer containing a psoralen furanside monoadduct raised the possibility that UvrB may bind specifically to ssDNA containing a lesion. Using the standard gel retardation assay, we tested the binding of UvrB to single-strand oligomers with three lesions known to be repaired by the (A)BC excinuclease: thymine-psoralen monoadduct, 1-2-d(GpG) cisplatin diadduct, and a synthetic AP site. The results are shown in Fig. 3. UvrB is indeed a DNA-binding protein, albeit with lower affinity than most specific DNA-binding proteins. It binds with higher affinity to psoralen or cisplatin-modified DNA (Kd~5 × 10−6M) than unmodified DNA or DNA containing an AP site (Kd > 10−5M). Furthermore, it appears that UvrB binds with higher affinity to lesions that are efficiently removed by (A)BC excinuclease (psoralen and cisplatin) than lesions that are poorly removed by this enzyme (AP site). To determine if UvrB also bound specifically to double-strand DNA with a lesion, gel retardation assays with single- and double-stranded DNAs containing a thymine-psoralen monoadduct were conducted. Fig. 4 shows that UvrB binds to ssDNA with T<>HMT but has no affinity for dsDNA containing the same adduct. Furthermore, it also appears that UvrB cannot discriminate between ssDNA and dsDNA when the DNA has no lesion (Fig. 5), which further supports the notion that UvrB binds specifically only to ssDNA with a lesion.Figure 5:A, binding of UvrB protein to single-strand and double-strand oligonucleotide. 5′ labeled single- and double-strand DNA were incubated in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing increasing concentrations of UvrB in ABC buffer for 20 min at 22°C.

Wild-type UvrB does not contain any tryptophan, but does contain 23 phenylalanine residues scattered throughout the protein (Arikan et al., 1986; Backendorf et al., 1986). By replacing phenylalanines with tryptophans through site-directed mutagenesis, we generated fluorescent UvrB derivatives in order to investigate UvrB-DNA interaction by fluorescence quenching. Seven phenylalanine residues that were distributed throughout the primary structure of UvrB were replaced individually with tryptophans to obtain UvrB mutants with a Trp residue at positions 88, 107, 187, 216, 365, 496, or 527. Since the Phe to Trp substitution is a conservative change, the mutant proteins were fully functional and behaved identically to wild-type UvrB protein in every aspect including in vivo complementation. The mutant proteins were purified and the quenching of Trp fluorescence of these mutants by ssDNA was investigated. The results of these studies are shown in Fig. 6. Several features of this data should be noted. First, the Trp emission maxima of all the mutants are between 330 and 340 nm, which is lower than the emission maximum of 355 nm for free tryptophan. The blue shift of the Trp emission typically occurs when the tryptophan is in a hydrophobic environment. Thus, it appears that all of the Trp residues and by extension, all of the Phe residues which were replaced by Trp residues, are located in a hydrophobic environment within UvrB. Second, according to fluorescence intensity, these mutants fall into three classes; F107W with the lowest intensity; F88W and F527W with intermediate intensity; and F187W, F216W, F365W, and F496W with the highest level of intensity. The environments of the various Trp residues influence the deactivation of the excited tryptophans by non-emissive pathways to different degrees and as a result, different fluorescence intensities are observed. To a first approximation, tryptophans more accessible to solvent or polar amino acids are more likely to decay by non-emissive pathway and hence, have lower quantum yield of fluorescence. Table 1 shows the quantum yields of Trp fluorescence for the various UvrB mutants. Finally, ssDNA specifically quenches the fluorescence of three mutants, F187W, F365W, and F496W. Quenching can be caused by either direct contact of the DNA with these tryptophans or as a result of a conformational change that may have occurred upon DNA binding which affects the solvent accessibility to these residues. In order to differentiate between these two possibilities, we conducted photoinduced dimer splitting by wild-type and mutant proteins.Table I Open table in a new tab In model studies on photosensitized splitting of pyrimidine dimers, it has been found that excitation of free indoles in solution (Helene and Charlier, 1977), tethered to the dimer (Kim et al., 1990), or as Trp residues in single-strand DNA-binding proteins (Helene and Charlier, 1977), all lead to the cleavage of the cyclobutane ring by photoinduced electron transfer (see Kim et al., 1992). In addition, for the reaction to occur from a DNA-bound protein with reasonable efficiency, the tryptophan must be in contact with the DNA (see Kim et al., 1992). Therefore, to determine if the fluorescence quenching of F187W, F365W, and F496W resulted from contact of the Trp residue with DNA or from a conformational change upon binding, the abilities of these mutants to split dimers were investigated. Wild-type and mutant UvrB proteins were mixed with a 49-nucleotide long single-strand DNA with a centrally located T<>T within the MseI recognition site T<>TAA (Svoboda et al., 1993) and irradiated with 293 nm light. Fig. 7 shows that none of the mutants which did not display any fluorescence quenching could photoreverse the dimer. Of the three mutants which displayed fluorescence quenching, F365W and F496W were capable of repairing the dimer, while F187W was not. We conclude that the quenching of fluorescence observed with F365W and F496W is the result of direct contact of the tryptophans in these mutants with the DNA and hence, these residues must be located within the DNA-binding domain of UvrB. In contrast, repeated attempts to repair dimers with F187W failed even though this mutant was quenched by DNA twice as efficiently as the other two mutants. It appears that upon binding to DNA, UvrB undergoes a significant conformational change such that residue 187 becomes substantially exposed to the solvent leading to drastic quenching of fluorescence of F187W. Furanside thymine-psoralen monoadduct is photoreactive and thus an oligonucleotide containing this adduct can be photocross-linked with 366 nm irradiation to proteins which bind this DNA (Orren et al., 1992). In order to further define the DNA-binding region of UvrB, photocross-linking experiments were done on UvrB− mutants which were isolated by alanine scanning mutagenesis within the putative DNA-binding domain of UvrB. In addition, two other mutants that had been previously characterized as either a DNA bending mutant, D478A (Lin et al., 1992; Hsu et al., 1994), or binding mutant, D510A (Lin et al., 1992), were tested as controls. The results (Fig. 8) revealed that three mutants, E98A, E265A, and E338A, had greatly reduced cross-linking efficiency compared to the wild-type protein. In addition, the D478A mutant cross-linked to DNA with an efficiency comparable to that of the wild-type UvrB protein, which is in agreement with the earlier conclusion that this mutant bound DNA normally but was unable to bend it. Unexpectedly, the D510A mutant which cannot be loaded onto DNA by UvrA, was also cross-linked quite efficiently. To investigate the DNA binding properties of these mutants further, we conducted gel retardation experiments with the same set of mutants. The results are shown in Fig. 9. Three mutants, E98A, E265A, and E338A had no detectable affinity for DNA; D510A had lower affinity, and D478A had affinity for DNA comparable to that of wild-type. The discrepancy between the earlier conclusion that D510A is a DNA binding mutant (Lin et al., 1992) and the current result can be reconciled by assuming that the main defect in this mutant is in the loading step (which is what was measured previously) rather than formation of a complex with the single-stranded region of the DNA after the loading reaction. In contrast, the three mutants, E98A, E265A, and E338A, are true DNA binding mutants which are defective in maintaining a stable complex subsequent to loading. In agreement with this conclusion, it was not possible to isolate UvrB-DNA complexes of these mutants by gel exclusion chromatography (data not shown), suggesting that these mutants either have no affinity for DNA or bind DNA very transiently. To investigate the latter point, incision assays were performed with (A)BC excinuclease reconstituted with the mutant proteins. The results are shown in Fig. 10. Unlike wild-type UvrB, only the 3′ incision was made by the (A)BC excinuclease reconstituted with the E98A, E265A, and E338A mutants. Since all available data suggest that UvrC makes the 5′ incision (Lin and Sancar, 1992) and that the 5′ incision, under certain conditions, is the rate-limiting step (Visse et al., 1994a), these results suggest that a transient UvrB-DNA complex is formed with the mutant UvrBs and when UvrC interacts with this complex, UvrB is able to make the 3′ incision. However, it also appears that these complexes are so transient that UvrB dissociates from the DNA before UvrC can make the 5′ incision. UvrB plays a central role in nucleotide excision repair. It interacts with both the UvrA and UvrC proteins in addition to binding, bending, and incising DNA. In this work, we have attempted to identify the regions of UvrB involved in interacting with UvrA, UvrC, and DNA. In light of our findings, the following structure-function model for UvrB is proposed (Fig. 11). There are two regions of UvrB which are responsible for binding to UvrA. The first region, encompassing amino acid residues 115-250, is homologous to a region in the amino-terminal half of TRCF which also binds UvrA (Selby and Sancar, 1993). The second region, encompassing amino acid residues 547-673, is located in the carboxyl terminus of UvrB. Previous studies have shown that cleavage of the 43 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of UvrB generates UvrB* (Arikan et al., 1986), which is catalytically inactive (Lin et al., 1992) but binds both UvrA (Orren and Sancar, 1989) and UvrC (Lin et al., 1992) with normal affinity. Therefore, the carboxyl-terminal region that is involved in binding to UvrA can be narrowed down to amino acid residues 547-630. Recently, the 135-amino acid long region in the TRCF, which has 25% sequence identity with amino acids 115-250 of UvrB, was found to be sufficient for high affinity binding of TRCF to UvrA (Selby and Sancar, 1995). Since UvrB makes a tighter complex with UvrA compared to TRCF, it is possible that the region in the carboxyl-terminal half of UvrB, which also interacts with UvrA, contributes to the formation of a more stable UvrA-UvrB complex. Significantly, the carboxyl-terminal domain of UvrB which interacts with UvrA is also essential for formation of a UvrB-UvrC complex. This finding, therefore, explains why a ternary complex containing all three subunits cannot be isolated, and why UvrA must dissociate from the A2B1-DNA complex before UvrC can bind to the UvrB-DNA complex and initiate the dual incisions. UvrB is a member of a family of proteins which require the assistance of a molecular matchmaker to bind DNA (Sancar and Hearst, 1993). In the case of UvrB, UvrA is required to load UvrB onto DNA with a lesion. It has been suggested that many of the proteins which bind to DNA by this mechanism can actually form a DNA-protein complex in the absence of the matchmaker under special conditions such as extremely high protein concentrations or the inclusion of macromolecular crowding compounds in the reaction mixture. For example, the β-clamp of DNA Pol III which is loaded onto DNA by the γ complex (Kuriyan and O'Donnell, 1993) can associate with DNA directly when a 100-fold molar excess over the DNA Pol III holoenzyme of the β subunit are used in the reaction (Crute et al., 1983; Kwon-Shin et al., 1987). Similarly, the gp45 protein, which is the polymerase clamp for T4 DNA polymerase (gp43) and is loaded onto DNA by the gp44/62 complex (Huang et al., 1981; Nossal and Alberts, 1984), can be loaded directly onto DNA by using either a high concentration of gp45 (Reddy et al., 1993) or by including polyethylene glycol in the reaction mixture (Sander et al., 1994). Here we show that this property of proteins which use the aid of molecular matchmakers also applies to UvrB. Specifically, we demonstrate that at high concentrations of UvrB, the protein can bind to ssDNA with a lesion in the absence of UvrA. Furthermore, based on the limited number of lesions we tested, it appears as though the affinity of UvrB to a lesion correlates with how efficiently that lesion is excised by the (A)BC excinuclease. Upon loading UvrB to a lesion, UvrA dissociates from the DNA, leaving a stable UvrB-DNA complex that is bent by about 130°C and in addition, is locally denatured by about 5-6 bp around the lesion (Sancar and Tang, 1993). This suggests that UvrB is the “ultimate damage recognition subunit” of the (A)BC excinuclease which determines the efficiency of removal of a lesion from DNA. Hence, this study proposes that in contrast to UvrA (the proximal damage recognition subunit), which recognizes damage in a duplex, UvrB binds to the area of denaturation around the lesion to form a UvrB-DNA complex and the formation of this complex then determines whether or not incision occurs. It has also been reported previously that although the (A)BC excinuclease recognizes a wide variety of damages, the level of excision is widely different for each type of damage (Huang et al., 1994). This study now shows that the affinity of UvrB to a particular lesion is correlated with how efficiently that lesion is excised and thus further supports the notion that UvrB is the ultimate damage recognition subunit of the (A)BC excinuclease. This conclusion, then, raises the question of how UvrB binds to damaged ssDNA. Several observations bear on this question. First, mutations in the charged residues of the so-called helicase motifs interfere with binding (Lin et al., 1992; Moolenaar et al., 1994; Seeley and Grossman, 1990) suggesting that these motifs constitute at least part of the DNA-binding domain. Second, these studies suggest that ionic interaction play an important role in the formation of a UvrB-DNA complex. However, seemingly parodoxically, the UvrB-DNA complexes are very stable in high-ionic strength buffers (Orren and Sancar, 1989, 1990) suggesting that the main interaction between UvrB and DNA is hydrophobic. Finally, in this study we have demonstrated by fluorescence quenching and photoinduced electron transfer that residues Phe-365 and Phe-496 of UvrB are presumably in direct contact with the DNA bases. All these observations combined suggest the following model for the formation of UvrB-DNA complexes: the initial contact with the DNA which is aided by UvrA, is mainly ionic in nature. Afterwards, upon ATP hydrolysis, UvrB undergoes a conformational change which expose residues Phe-365, Phe-496, and possibly other aromatic residues for direct interaction, perhaps by intercalation, with the bases. The proposed mode of interaction may also explain the “specific” binding of UvrB to a lesion. Since the (A)BC excinuclease repairs virtually all lesions in DNA, previously we and others have argued that the subunits of the enzyme cannot be making direct contact with an essentially infinite number of chemical groups which constitute a “lesion” and hence it has been generally assumed that the enzyme recognizes the backbone distortions of the DNA (Sancar and Tang, 1993; Grossman and Thiagalingam, 1993). In light of our finding of direct binding of UvrB to lesions, we would like to propose the following model: UvrB in fact does have a lesion binding pocket where the modified bases fit in. We propose that this is a hydrophobic pocket and because of lack of requirements for specific H-bond donors or acceptors or for formation of salt bridges of unique orientations, a vast number of chemical groups can be accommodated within this pocket. Presumably the degree of hydrophobicity, the size as well as some other, as yet to be determined, factors contribute to the relative affinities of various side groups for UvrB and hence their susceptibilities to function as substrates."

https://openalex.org/W2154373957,"The purpose of the present study was to analyze the post-translational and activation-dependent modifications of the G protein-coupled thrombin receptor. A human receptor cDNA was engineered to encode an epitope tag derived from the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein at the COOH terminus of the receptor and expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. We show here that the mature receptor is a glycosylated protein with an apparent molecular mass ranging from 68 to 80 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Removal of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides with N-glycosidase F leads to the appearance of a 36-40-kDa receptor species.

Whereas thrombin treatment of cells results in increased mobility of the receptor in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we found that their treatment with the thrombin receptor agonist peptide leads to a decrease in thrombin receptor mobility due, in part, to phosphorylation.

Thrombin initiates the majority of its biological effects on cells via a surface receptor for which the corresponding cDNA has been cloned (1Vu T.K.H. Hung D. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

The thrombin receptor cDNA sequence encodes a member of the G protein receptor superfamily with 8 hydrophobic domains, including one at the extreme NH2 terminus, which presumably corresponds to a signal peptide sequence. Five potential sites for asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation are present on the human receptor (and four on the hamster receptor), as well as numerous serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues that are potential sites of phosphorylation. On the NH2-terminal external domain, a putative thrombin cleavage site has been identified which is characterized by an arginine (Arg-41) flanked on the carboxyl side by a cluster of negatively charged residues displaying sequence similarity to the thrombin-binding domain in the tail of the thrombin inhibitor hirudin (see (2Rasmussen U.B.

The presence of this cleavage site on the receptor, along with the observation that thrombin stimulation of cellular effects requires a proteolytically active enzyme, has led to the following model of receptor activation (1Vu T.K.H. Hung D. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that thrombin specifically recognizes its receptor via the acidic hirudin-like domain, located approximately 10-20 residues downstream of the proposed cleavage site. Ensuing cleavage of the Arg-41/Ser-42 bond exposes a sequence (SFLLRN) that is capable of activating the receptor by interacting with an undefined ligand-binding domain. Several lines of evidence favor this hypothesis, including the fact that the cellular effects of thrombin can be mimicked by synthetic peptides corresponding to the unmasked ligand sequence(1Vu T.K.H.

Finally, treatment of cells with thrombin is accompanied by the release of the NH2-terminal activation peptide from the cell surface, as determined by the loss of binding to cells of antibodies specific to the cleaved off sequence (9Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies addressing post-/co-translational modifications and structure-function relationships have been carried out on other G protein-coupled receptor family members, in particular the β2-adrenergic receptor and rhodopsin (for reviews, see Refs. 10 and 11). Using biochemical and/or genetic approaches, it has been demonstrated that these receptors can undergo glycosylation and palmitylation during biosynthesis. Activation-dependent phosphorylation, which plays a role in receptor desensitization, has also been shown. The high degree of sequence similarity observed among serpentine receptors would indicate that they undergo similar post-translational and activation-dependent modifications. However, little is known at present about the post-/co-translational and activation-dependent modifications of the thrombin receptor. Characterization of this receptor has been difficult due, in part, to the lack of an efficient stable expression system and appropriate antibodies. In the present study, we have obtained high expression levels of the receptor in human 293 cells. The addition of an epitope tag on the receptor has allowed us to analyze the protein and to directly demonstrate its glycosylation, phosphorylation, and cleavage by thrombin.

Receptor expression was verified by indirect immunofluorescent staining of cells using anti-VSVG antibodies. Cells plated in 6-well plates on glass coverslips were fixed in a 1:1 mixture of methanol:formaldehyde (15 min at −20°C and then 10 min at room temperature). For staining, fixed cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-VSVG antibodies diluted 1:500 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% gelatin. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution, 45 min at room temperature) was used to reveal the primary antibodies. Cultures were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy with a Nikon Diaphot microscope (fluor 40/1.3 oil Ph4 DL). Crude membrane preparations were prepared following a hypotonic shock of cells as follows. Confluent monolayers in 10-cm culture dishes were rinsed once in TE (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) and once in H2O before harvesting in 0.5 × TE buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF) and incubating on ice for less than 5 min. Subsequently, swollen cells were disrupted by passing them six times through a 26 gauge needle, and nuclei were removed by centrifugation (2000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C). The nuclei-depleted supernatant was recovered and spun at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C to pellet the crude membrane fraction, which was resuspended in 0.5 × TE buffer with inhibitors. Removal of asparagine-linked high mannose, hybrid, and complex oligosaccharides with N-glycosidase F was performed on freshly prepared membranes (5000 NEB units/20 μg of protein) according to the protocol suggested by New England Biolabs, except that all incubations were carried out at room temperature. Following the indicated treatment, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in Triton lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100), and centrifuged (12,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4°C. Clarified lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with wheat germ Lectin-Sepharose 6MB (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and then washed four times in lysis buffer. For immunoblotting, wheat germ-enriched fractions were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 2 M urea, separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and transferred to Hybond C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). The membranes were blocked using TN buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl) containing 5% non-fat milk prior to incubation for 2 h with the anti-VSVG antibody. Blots were washed with TN containing 0.02% Triton X-100 (TN-Triton) prior to incubation with the peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. The thrombin receptor was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham). Cells grown to confluence in 10-cm dishes were washed and incubated for 4 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 200 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Agonists were added for the indicated times immediately prior to solubilization of cells in 600 μl of Triton lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (as indicated above) for 20 min at 4°C. Lysates were incubated for 45 min at 4°C with non-immune mouse serum coupled to protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and centrifuged prior to incubation of the clarified lysates (2 h at 4°C) with anti-VSVG antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose. Following immunoprecipitation, samples were washed five times in lysis buffer, twice in high salt buffer (lysis buffer containing 0.5 M LiCl), and two times in low salt butter (lysis buffer without NaCl) and then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing urea and separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% resolving gels. Phosphorylation of the thrombin receptor was revealed by autoradiography of dried gels. Determination of total polyphosphoinositide formation was performed on cells in 12-well plates essentially as described(14Seuwen K. Lagarde A. Pouysségur J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), except that 3H-labeled myoinositol (2 μCi/ml) was added to cell culture medium approximately 24 h prior to the experiment. The pTRV plasmid construct containing the human thrombin receptor cDNA (Fig. 1, top) was transfected in 293 human embryonic kidney cells, and G418-resistant cell populations or independent clones were selected. The cDNA was placed under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, which has been shown to direct high level expression of transfected sequences in these cells(15Kronman C. Velan B. Gozes Y. Leitner M. Flashner Y. Lazar A. Marcus D. Sery T. Papier Y. Grosfeld H. Cohen S. Shafferman A. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To detect the expressed receptor, an epitope tag that corresponds to a sequence of the VSVG was fused to the COOH terminus of the protein. The VSVG tag sequence is recognized by the specific monoclonal antibody, P4D5. Using P4D5 antibody, G418-resistant clones expressing the human or hamster thrombin receptor were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Fig. 1(bottom, A) depicts the VSVG-specific staining of a clone (293TRV2J), which expresses relatively high levels of the tagged receptor. Staining is predominantly at the cell surface, both in cells fixed with methanol/formaldehyde (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) and in cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 to render the internal epitope accessible to antibodies. It is noteworthy that a similar pattern of staining was observed with polyclonal antibodies directed against the human receptor agonist peptide sequence immediately adjacent to the thrombin cleavage site of the receptor. 2D. Grall, V. Vouret-Craviari, and U. Rasmussen, unpublished results. Background staining with anti-VSVG antibodies is virtually absent in nontransfected 293 cells (Fig. 1, bottom, B). Interestingly, upon inspection of several independent G418-resistant clones, we observed the presence of both positively staining cells and unstained cells in each clone. Cells expressing the thrombin receptor were generally rounder and less adherent to the culture dish than cells devoid of receptor expression. The staining of positive cells in all clones examined was quite intense and uniform, as if the cells were expressing similar numbers of receptors. However, the percentage of labeled cells varied from one clone to another, resulting in different levels of functional expression. As indicated in Fig. 2, the percentage of fluorescent cells in different clones correlated well with the extent of functional receptor expression by each clone, as determined by phospholipase C activation in response to thrombin or thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRP). Note that basal rates of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis remain low in clones expressing high levels of thrombin receptor, indicating that the non-liganded receptor is tightly controlled. Further, the dose dependence of thrombin-stimulated phospholipase C activation in transfected cells was similar to that observed in fibroblasts, which express only the endogenous receptor (not shown). Altogether, these results indicate that the VSVG sequence at the COOH terminus of the receptor does not impair ligand-induced receptor activation, regulation, or G protein coupling. It can also be seen in Fig. 2 that low levels of endogenous thrombin receptor activity can be detected in nontransfected 293 cells. Consistent with this observation, we have observed the 3.5-kilobase thrombin receptor mRNA transcript in parental 293 cells by Northern blot analysis (not shown). To visualize the expressed receptor protein and to analyze its presumed cleavage by thrombin, Western blot analyses were performed on freshly prepared membranes from transfected clones expressing the tagged receptor. As shown in Fig. 3, the receptor migrates as an elongated band ranging from approximately 68 to 80 kDa when separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide gels. This unique band, seen with the anti-VSVG antibody, is specific to the thrombin receptor since it is absent in parental 293 cells. Furthermore, the same band is observed in immunoblots using antibodies raised against residues 42-55 of the human thrombin receptor, corresponding to the agonist peptide sequence (Fig. 3A). Thrombin treatment of cells prior to membrane preparation induces a shift in mobility, resulting in the appearance of a faster migrating band that corresponds to the cleaved receptor (Fig. 3B). By contrast, treatment of cells with TRP, which activates the receptor without cleaving it, slows down receptor migration. The calculated molecular mass of the VSVG-tagged mature human thrombin receptor is 46.5 kDa (assuming that signal peptide cleavage occurs after alanine-26(16Brass L.F. Hoxie A. Manning D.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Following thrombin cleavage (Arg-41/Ser-42), the receptor loses 2.8 kDa, resulting in a calculated molecular mass of 43.7 kDa. To explain this considerable difference between the calculated molecular mass and the apparent size in SDS-PAGE, we examined the glycosylated state of the receptor. Five potential sites for N-linked glycosylation (NX(S/T), X ≠ P) are present on the human thrombin receptor(1Vu T.K.H. Hung D. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar). To determine whether the receptor is glycosylated on asparagine residues, freshly prepared membranes from cells expressing the tagged receptor were treated with N-glycosidase F, and Western analyses were performed using anti-VSVG antibodies. Removal of N-linked high mannose and hybrid and complex oligosaccharides with N-glycosidase F led to the appearance of a receptor species ranging from 36-40 kDa (Fig. 4). In addition to N-linked glycosylation, it is likely that the receptor contains O-linked carbohydrate, since we observed a slight decrease in its apparent Mr by immunoblot analyses following treatment of membranes with neuraminidase and O-glycosidase (not shown). Since the protein was found to be highly glycosylated, we performed lectin affinity purification of cell lysates to increase the yield of receptor for further analysis. First, the time course of receptor cleavage was examined using wheat germ-enriched fractions of solubilized cells. By Western analysis using anti-VSVG antibodies, specific labeling of the receptor was observed in transfected 293 cells, whereas no bands could be detected in nontransfected cells. As shown in Fig. 5, cleavage of the receptor by thrombin (10−8M) occurs within 1 min and appears to be maximal 2 min after treatment of cells with the protease. Upon short exposure of the blot, the receptor migrates as three sharp bands (of which the lowest is the major species) within a broad diffuse band. Following cleavage, a smaller Mr band appears, and the trailing smear migrates faster. Treatment with TRP, which activates the receptor independent of cleavage, induces an upward shift of the diffuse band and more intense staining of the sharp band of higher Mr. We next investigated whether the upward shift in mobility of the receptor activated by TRP was due to some post-translational modification, such as polyubiquitination or phosphorylation. Ligand-induced receptor ubiquitination of growth factor receptors has previously been demonstrated. In the case of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, modification was maximal 7 min following platelet-derived growth factor addition, as determined by immunoblotting of lectin-enriched cell lysates using anti-ubiquitin antiserum(17Mori S. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6429-6434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In TRV cells, we were unable to detect any addition of ubiquitin to the thrombin receptor upon activation by thrombin or TRP (results not shown). Concerning phosphorylation, it has recently been reported that the thrombin receptor expressed in rat 1 cells is phosphorylated following thrombin treatment(18Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Vouret-Craviari V. Auberger P. Pouysségur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4813-4821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine the phosphorylated state of the tagged receptor in transfected 293 cells, we performed in vivo labeling experiments using [32P]orthophosphate followed by immunoprecipitation of the receptor with anti-VSVG antibodies and autoradiography. The results in Fig. 6 show that under non-stimulated conditions, receptor phosphorylation could not be detected. After thrombin addition, we observed phosphorylation of a protein that migrated with the expected Mr of the thrombin receptor and that was absent in immunoprecipitates from nontransfected 293 cells. TRP also induced receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 6). Thus, activation-dependent phosphorylation could account, at least in part, for the decreased mobility of the receptor observed following TRP stimulation of cells. Indeed, phosphatase treatment was able to slightly increase mobility of the activated receptor (results not shown). To further analyze thrombin receptor cleavage, we examined the electrophoretic mobility of the receptor in glycoprotein-enriched fractions prepared from transfected 293 clones following treatment with serine proteases displaying different specificities, including trypsin, plasmin, and chymotrypsin. By Western analysis (Fig. 7), we observed that trypsin and, to a lesser extent, plasmin treatment both induce a downward shift in apparent Mr of the receptor similar to that observed with thrombin. These proteases cleave at the carboxylic side of lysine or arginine residues, with plasmin being more selective (lysyl specific) than trypsin. Chymotrypsin, which cleaves following aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophane), induced receptor cleavage, which resulted in a greater increase in mobility than that induced by thrombin. This suggests that chymotrypsin cleavage occurs following some residue distal to arginine-41 where thrombin cleavage occurs. The functional consequences of thrombin receptor cleavage in TRV cells were determined by evaluating the effect of these proteases on phospholipase C activation. As shown in Fig. 8, trypsin is able to induce efficient thrombin receptor coupling to phospholipase C, at approximately 10-fold higher doses than those required for thrombin to stimulate the effect. We found that plasmin induced a weak but significant response as well. These results are consistent with the ability of these proteases to induce a mobility shift in the receptor that is similar to the one induced by thrombin. Chymotrypsin, which cleaves the receptor at a position different than thrombin, impaired the ability of thrombin to activate the receptor in TRV cells, presumably due to removal of the thrombin recognition and cleavage sites on the receptor. By contrast, cleavage of the receptor by chymotrypsin did not destroy its responsiveness to TRP, which is independent of cleavage, suggesting that the chymotrypsin-truncated receptor is able to assume a functional conformation and interact with G proteins. In the present study, stable expression of the thrombin receptor was obtained using 293 human embryonic kidney cells. Heterologous expression of the receptor was considerably higher in this system than in other fibroblastic cell lines that we have examined to date for reasons that are not clear at the present time. Since immunocytochemical analyses of transfected cells revealed that thrombin receptor expression was heterogeneous in clonal populations, we did not attempt to determine receptor numbers expressed by the different TRV clones. Interestingly, we observed a similar heterogeneity of expression for other receptors (e.g. the 5-HT2 and α2-adrenergic receptors) stably transfected in 293 cells and fibroblasts. These results indicate that ligand binding assays on transfected clones may not accurately determine receptor numbers per cell. Indeed, this should be kept in mind when interpreting functional studies on clones thought to express low, moderate, or high receptor numbers per cell. Nonetheless, we found that functional receptor expression by the different transfected clones, as measured by thrombin- or TRP-induced phospholipase C stimulation, correlated well with the number of positively staining cells. Analysis of the receptor-mediated phospholipase C response in transfected cells indicated that the epitope tag attached to the COOH terminus of the receptor does not significantly modify receptor activity. The VSVG sequence, corresponding to an epitope that is virtually absent in nontransfected cells, has proved to be very useful for characterization of the receptor protein. Although Western blots of the thrombin receptor from platelet membranes or transfected cells have previously been published(6Brass L.F. Vassallo R.R. Belmonte E. Ahuja M. Cichowski K. Howie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13795-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hung D.T. Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1350-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), no visualization of receptor cleavage has been shown to our knowledge. In the present investigation, we were able to directly demonstrate thrombin receptor cleavage by immunoblot analysis. In addition to thrombin, we found that trypsin, plasmin, and chymotrypsin are able to cleave the receptor expressed at the surface of 293 cells. This system should be useful to determine whether the receptor is a substrate for other proteases as well. Recently, Suidan et al.(21Suidan H.S. Bouvier J. Schaerer E. Stone S.R. Monard D. Tschopp J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8112-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) reported that granzyme A, a serine protease stored in cytoplasmic granules of T lymphocytes, is capable of cleaving and activating the thrombin receptor. In their study, a synthetic 32-mer peptide spanning the activation site of the receptor was cleaved by the enzyme. It remains to be determined whether receptor cleavage by granzyme A occurs in intact cells. Trypsin is a full agonist of the phospholipase C response in cells that express the thrombin receptor, although thrombin is 10-fold more potent than trypsin for this effect. The enhanced efficiency of thrombin to cleave and activate its receptor has been attributed to the presence of a hirudin-like sequence adjacent to the cleavage site on the receptor that binds to the anion-binding exosite of thrombin(3Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Hung D.T. Charo I. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In contrast to trypsin, phospholipase C activation by plasmin in TRV cells was found to be weak. Although this observation is not fully understood at present, it is possible that cleavage of the receptor by plasmin is not restricted to the arginine-41/serine-42 bond since additional bands are occasionally visible on immunnoblots of the plasmin-cleaved receptor. It is clear from our immunoblot analyses that chymotrypsin cleaves the receptor and that the chymotrypsin cleavage site is distinct from the thrombin cleavage site. This result provides an explanation for the finding over 10 years ago that chymotrypsin modifies the platelet response to thrombin(22Tam S.W. Fenton II, J.W. Detwiler T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6626-6632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23McGowan E.B. Detwiler T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 739-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This effect of chymotrypsin on human platelets is specific to thrombin-induced activation and can be overcome by high doses of thrombin. Although the site(s) of chymotrypsin cleavage has not been defined, chymotrypsin treatment of the receptor results in the loss of approximately 7 kDa, indicating that cleavage may remove up to 60 amino acids from the NH2 terminus. The fact that this truncation by chymotrypsin does not lead to receptor activation provides further evidence supporting the proposal by Chen et al.(24Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that receptor activation does not occur by release of the receptor from tonic inhibition imposed by its NH2-terminal sequences. The presence of N-linked glycosylation sites within the NH2-terminal domain is a common feature of seven transmembrane domain receptors, with 92% (211/229) of the receptors surveyed in a recent study displaying this feature(25Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Glycosylation of the NH2 terminus has been confirmed for several of them (e.g. on residues Asn-6 and Asn-15 in the β2-adrenergic receptor), using different approaches (see (10Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and references therein). To explain the difference between the apparent Mr of the receptor in SDS-PAGE and its calculated Mr, Brass and colleagues (6Brass L.F. Vassallo R.R. Belmonte E. Ahuja M. Cichowski K. Howie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13795-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that carbohydrates contribute to as much as one-third of the mass of the receptor. Indeed, enzymatic deglycosylation of the receptor with N-glycosidase F presented here confirms this prediction. In the study by Brass et al.(6Brass L.F. Vassallo R.R. Belmonte E. Ahuja M. Cichowski K. Howie J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13795-13798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the platelet thrombin receptor migrated as a relatively thin band of Mr = 66,000 ± 1000 in SDS-PAGE. The epitope-tagged receptor expressed in 293 cells migrates in our gel system as a large diffuse band ranging from approximately 68 to 80 kDa, presumably due to heterogeneity in the oligosaccharide chains. We have not identified which of the five potential N-linked oligosaccharide sites on the human receptor (three on the NH2-terminal extension and two on the second extracellular loop) are used. However, the first asparagine (position 35) is not conserved in the hamster(2Rasmussen U.B. Vouret-Craviari V. Jallat S. Schlesinger Y. Pagès G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.-P. Pouysségur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), rat(26Zhong C. Hayzer D.J. Corson M.A. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16975-16979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or mouse (Genbank accession no. L03529) thrombin receptor sequences. N-Linked oligosaccharide chains tend to be localized to a single extracytosolic segment (>30 residues long), and the acceptor site is often the first (most NH2-terminal) in the protein, according to a recent survey of glycosylation sites utilized in mammalian multi-span membrane proteins(25Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The fact that we never detected the presence of additional bands migrating between the fully glycosylated protein and the deglycosylated form of the thrombin receptor, following partial digestion with N-glycosidase F, 3D. Grall and E. Van Obberghen-Schilling, unpublished observations. may suggest that a single site is utilized. In addition to N-linked glycosylation sites, serine and threonine residues in the extracellular domains of the receptor may serve as acceptor sites for O-linked carbohydrates, since neuraminidase and O-glycosidase treatment of membranes induced a slight shift in Mr of the receptor (data not shown). As to the possible role of receptor glycosylation, it may be involved in proper folding of the polypeptide chain during biosynthesis and/or in its transport to the cell surface. This was found to be the case in a recent study on rhodopsin(27Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4024-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, N-linked glycosylation of rhodopsin was found to be important in signal transduction. Glycosylation has also been shown to protect proteins from proteolysis (for review, see (28Rasmunsen R.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 682-686Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). In the case of the thrombin receptor, the presence of oligosaccharides on the external receptor surface may modulate thrombin recognition or post-cleavage conformational changes of the receptor that influence tethered ligand binding and receptor activation. Mutagenesis studies on the thrombin receptor will be required to identify the site(s) of glycosylation and to determine whether their elimination impairs the biosynthesis and/or function of the receptor. Activation-dependent phosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptors by members of the G protein receptor kinase family has been found to be an important mechanism underlying the desensitization process (for review, see (11Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar)). We show here that thrombin induces phosphorylation of its receptor expressed in 293 cell, and that the effect is mediated by the receptor since the agonist peptide stimulates phosphorylation in a cleavage-independent manner. Receptor phosphorylation may account for the apparent increase in molecular weight of the receptor seen following treatment of cells with the TRP. Presumably, this phosphorylation is mediated by a G protein receptor kinase. This question was addressed in a recent study by Ishii et al.(18Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who observed that BARK2 efficiently attenuated thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization when co-expressed with the receptor in Xenopus oocytes. Findings from this study and results from our laboratory indicate that sequences in the COOH terminus of the receptor are targets for G protein receptor kinase(s)(19Vouret-Craviari V. Auberger P. Pouysségur J. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4813-4821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we believe that the stable expression system described here should be very useful for structure-activity studies on the thrombin receptor. Downstream signaling events can also be investigated in this system following transient expression of the receptor (or receptor mutants) along with signaling components (i.e. G protein subunits) or regulatory proteins (members of the G protein receptor kinase or arrestin families).

In response to a wide range of stimuli, neutrophils and other microbicidal phagocytes undergo a respiratory burst in which molecular oxygen is converted to superoxide (O2+) 1The abbreviations used are: O2+superoxide anion radicalCGDchronic granulomatous diseaseINTp-iodonitrotetrazolium violetNBTnitro blue tetrazoliumOGoctyl-β-D-glucopyranosideDCFH-DA2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate)PVDFpolyvinylidene difluoridePMNpolymorphonuclear neutrophilPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. and other reactive species(1Morel F. Doussière J. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 523-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The enzyme responsible for this activity, NADPH oxidase, is localized to the plasma membrane of the cells, which also forms the phagolysosomal membrane. The function of this oxidase system in phagocytes is to participate in the destruction of bacteria, fungi, parasites, virus-infected cells, and tumors by directing the reactive oxygen species against the target cells. In order to respond to a wide range of dissimilar stimuli and to minimize damage to normal tissues, the neutrophil has evolved a complex signal transduction mechanism to regulate NADPH oxidase. This signaling pathway is not yet fully understood. In part, the oxidase is regulated by separation of component parts in different cellular localizations. Thus, assembly of the oxidase at the plasma membrane, promoting electron transfer between the redox components of the oxidase, is one of the important steps in the activation process. An essential component of this oxidase system is a unique low potential b-type cytochrome, cytochrome b245 (also known as cytochrome b−245 or cytochrome b559)(2Cross A.R Jones O.T.G. Garcia R. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 208: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The cytochrome is a heterodimeric protein consisting of a 22-kDa α- subunit, termed p22phox(phagocyte oxidase), and a heavily glycosylated 91-kDa β- subunit termed gp91phox.

Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21448-21454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this inherited disorder, there is a failure of the phagocytic cells to generate O2+. Affected individuals suffer from severe recurrent infections due to the inability of the phagocytes to effectively kill infecting micro-organisms. Since the realization that defects in NADPH oxidase are the cause of CGD, it has proved possible to identify four essential polypeptide components of this system, defects in any one of which can lead to the clinical phenotype of CGD. Individuals with genetic lesions in either gp91phox (type X91° CGD) or p22phox (type A22° CGD) usually have phagocytes that do not express detectable levels of either cytochrome polypeptide, suggesting that the individual subunits are unstable in the absence of their partners(6Parkos C.A. Dinauer M.C. Jesaitis A.J. Orkin S.H. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1989; 73: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Segal A.W. Nature. 1987; 326: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In a very few cases, missense mutations have resulted in normal levels of a spectrally normal, but nonfunctional cytochrome b245 (type X91+ CGD) or a decreased abundance of a fully or partly functional cytochrome b245 (X91+ CGD)(8Curnutte J.T. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1993; 67: S2-S15Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition to the membrane-bound redox centers of NADPH oxidase, there are at least three other components required for the fully active enzyme that are present in the cytosolic fraction of disrupted neutrophils. Defects in the genes coding for two of these proteins, p47phox and p67phox, result in two of the recognized forms of CGD(8Curnutte J.T. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1993; 67: S2-S15Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The third cytosolic factor is the low molecular weight GTP-binding protein, Rac. Initially, Rac1 was isolated from guinea pig macrophages (9Abo A. Pick E. Hall A. Totty N. Teahan C. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) and Rac2 from human neutrophils(10Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), based on their ability to substantially augment cell-free O2+ production. Subsequent studies using wholly or partially recombinant systems have shown that Rac (either form) is absolutely required for NADPH oxidase activity. Here we describe a new patient (patient A) with neutrophils that express normal levels of a cytochrome that is non functional in terms of O2+ production, but retains normal dye-reductase activity. By comparison with another patient (patient B) previously described by Dinauer et al. (patient RC in (11Dinauer M.C. Curnutte J.T. Rosen H. Orkin S.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 2012-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)) whose neutrophils express a cytochrome b245 in which there is a Pro415→ His substitution in gp91phox, we can infer that patient A has a mutation affecting electron transfer processes subsequent to flavin reduction, whereas patient B has a mutation affecting the initial electron transfer processes preventing enzyme flavin reduction. For experiments with intact neutrophils (including translocation studies) blood was collected by venipuncture and the neutrophils purified by dextran sedimentation, hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes, and centrifugation through Ficoll-Hypaque(12Badwey J.A. Curnutte J.T. Berde C.B. Karnovsky M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For the preparation of subcellular fractions neutrophils were obtained from normal subjects and CGD patients by leukapheresis (13Curnutte J.T. Scott P.J. Babior B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and purified as described above with the omission of the dextran sedimentation step. Neutrophils were treated with 2.5 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate for 10 min at 4°C, disrupted in relaxation buffer (100 mM KCl, 3 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 1.25 mM EGTA, 10 mM PIPES, pH 7.3) (14Borregaard N. Heiple J.M. Simons E.R. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) by N2 cavitation, and fractionated on discontinuous Percoll gradients. These methods, described in detail elsewhere(15Curnutte J.T. Kuver R. Scott P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5563-5569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Babior B.M. Kuver R. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1713-1718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), produce cytosol and plasma membrane fractions whose final concentrations were adjusted to 9 × 107 and 1.25 × 109 cell equivalents (cell eq)/ml, respectively. Fractions were stored at −80°C for up to 1 year without loss of activity. Experiments to study the translocation of p47phox and p67phox from the soluble to the particulate neutrophil fractions were performed exactly as described by Heyworth et al.(17Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), using PMA (100 ng/ml) as the stimulus. Neutrophil fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on homogeneous 10 or 13% acrylamide gels (see figure legends) with prestained Rainbow protein markers (Amersham Corp.) as molecular mass standards. Separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) in a Transblot cell (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, 10% goat serum in HEPES-buffered saline and the blots probed with antibodies to the appropriate subunits of NADPH oxidase. Antisera to the Phox proteins were raised in rabbits using synthetic peptides (coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin) corresponding to amino acid residues 340-355 of p47phox (RPGPQSPGSPLEEERQ), 437-450 of p67phox (DEPKESEKADANNQ), 153-170 of p22phox (SNPPPRPPAEARKKPSEE), and 537-556 of gp91phox (CGPEALAETLSKQSISNSES). The antisera to p47phox and p22phox were used without further purification at dilutions of 1:2000 and 1:1000 respectively. Antibodies to p67phox and gp91phox were affinity-purified on Affi-Gel columns (Bio-Rad) to which the cognate peptides had been coupled. A goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:1000 dilution) (Bio-Rad), together with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium substrates (Bio-Rad) were used to detect bound primary antibody. The protein content of neutrophil membrane fractions was estimated using the BCA microassay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Whole cell O2+ production was determined spectrophotometrically by the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c(15Curnutte J.T. Kuver R. Scott P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5563-5569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NBT slide tests were performed as described previously(18Ochs H.D. Igo R.P. J. Pediatr. 1973; 83: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Intracellular production of oxidants was assayed using a flow cytometric assay of dichlorofluorescein fluorescence, using the method described by Bass (19Bass D.A. Parce J.W. DeChatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, neutrophils were preincubated at a cell density of 106/ml for 15 min at 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline (138 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.47 mM KH2PO4) supplemented with glucose (5 mM) and gelatin (0.1%) containing 5 μM DCFH-DA. Tubes were mixed every 5 min. Stock solutions (5 mM) of DHFH-DA (Eastman Kodak Co.) in EtOH were prepared fresh daily and kept in the dark at room temperature. After preincubation, catalase was added (275 units/ml), and the samples were divided into two 1-ml aliquots. PMA (100 ng/ml in Me2SO) was added to one tube and Me2SO to the other. After 10- and 20-min incubation at room temperature, samples were read on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) equipped with a 15-milliwatt argon laser and FACScan Research Software. 10,000 events were collected; cellular aggregates and debris were excluded by gating on the neutrophil population. Mean channel fluorescence was calculated for each sample using a linear scale, the unstimulated (+Me2SO) control values were subtracted from the stimulated (+PMA) fluorescence. INT reductase activities of NADPH oxidase activated in the cell-free system were assayed spectrophotometrically in 96-well microtiter plates using a kinetic plate reader as described previously(5Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21448-21454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). O2+ assays were performed on membranes prepared from PMA-activated neutrophils and on membranes and cytosols prepared from unstimulated neutrophils using the cell-free activation system in microtiter plates by determination of the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable rate of cytochrome c reduction(20Curnutte J.T. Scott P.J. Mayo L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These assays were also used to determine the Michaelis parameters for NADPH oxidase. Molecular genetic analyses were undertaken as described previously using genomic DNA extracted from 3 ml of whole blood(21Hopkins P.J. Kuruto R. Curnutte J.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1992; 51 (Abstract 137)Google Scholar). Details of these methods will be published fully elsewhere. 2J. Rae, P. J. Hopkins, and J. T. Curnutte, manuscript in preparation. Reduced minus oxidized difference spectra were recorded as described previously using 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 extracts of whole neutrophils (15Curnutte J.T. Kuver R. Scott P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5563-5569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 2% (w/v) OG extracts of neutrophil plasma membranes that had been washed with 1 M NaCl to remove myeloperoxidase(22Parkos C.A. Allen R.C. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). CO difference spectra were recorded by reduction of a detergent extract of membranes with a few grains of sodium dithionite, storing the spectrum in the memory of the spectrophotometer, then gently bubbling the contents of the cuvette with CO for 60 s (one to two bubbles/s through a fine pipette attached to the gas line) and re-recording the spectrum. The subtraction of the original trace results in the (reduced + CO) minus (reduced) spectrum. Reoxidation of reduced cytochrome b245 by oxygen was assessed by reducing an aliquot of detergent-solubilized membranes with a slight excess of crystalline sodium dithionite (0.5 mg), recording the absorbance spectrum, and reoxidizing the reduced flavin and cytochrome b245 by gentle end over end mixing of the contents of the cuvette to introduce atmospheric oxygen; after 30-s agitation the spectrum was re-recorded to determine changes in the degree of cytochrome b245 reduction. NADPH-dependent reduction of FAD and cytochrome b245 in 2% OG extracts of neutrophil plasma membranes after cell-free activation of NADPH oxidase activity was determined under conditions of reduced oxygen tension using the galactose and galactose oxidase system described previously(23Cross A.R. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6543-6548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Patient A had been diagnosed with CGD at 7 years of age following a history of recurrent infections and an abnormal NBT slide test. The family history was highly suggestive of X-linked inheritance. On evaluation at Scripps Clinic, no O2+ production could be detected from the patient's neutrophils using either PMA or formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine as the stimulus, confirming the clinical diagnosis of CGD. NBT slide tests performed on normal subjects show 98-100% of PMN strongly staining with purple NBT formazan after stimulation of the cells with PMA(8Curnutte J.T. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1993; 67: S2-S15Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Typical CGD patients (both X-linked (X91° and X91+, including patient B) and autosomal recessive forms (A22°, A47°, and A67°)) show no detectable NBT staining. In contrast, neutrophils and monocytes from patient A displayed a uniform population (98-100%) of weakly staining cells (not shown). This staining pattern is similar to that observed in a very few other variant X-linked CGD patients (X91+ CGD), with diminished levels (3-25%) of a functional cytochrome b245. 3P. J. Hopkins and J. T. Curnutte, unpublished data. Unlike patient A, these X91+ CGD patients have neutrophils that are capable of diminished levels of O2+ production that broadly correlate with their degree of cytochrome expression. Measurements of intracellular oxidant production using the fluorescent probes DCFH-DA and rhodamine 123 have shown that in marked contrast to patients with mutations in gp91phox or p22phox in which cytochrome b245 is missing (X91° or A22° CGD) and who have essentially no production of intracellular oxidants, neutrophils from patients with p47phox deficiency have levels of intracellular oxidant production intermediate between cytochrome b245-deficient patients and normal controls. 4Rae, J., and Curnutte, J. T., manuscript in preparation. The reactive species responsible for the oxidation of the DCFH is probably H2O2. It should be emphasized that with neither cytochrome-deficient nor p47phox-deficient CGD neutrophils can any extracellular O2+ or H2O2 be detected. Analysis of intracellular oxidant production in the neutrophils of patient A gave a high intermediate fluorescence value of 85 after 10 min, and 231 after 20 min, PMA stimulation, compared with the normal control of 246 and 495 at 10 and 20 min, respectively (Table 1). These values are higher than that observed in p47phox deficient CGD patients (35 and 129 at 10 and 20 min, respectively). In contrast, the PMN of patient B gave a low mean fluorescence values of 10 at 10 min and 55 at 20 min, similar to the values of 7 at 10 min and 16 at 20 min observed in cytochrome-deficient X91° CGD patients (Table 1).Table I Open table in a new tab In order to define more closely the type of CGD, cell-free O2+ assays were performed in microtiter plates using combinations of membranes and cytosol from patient A and normal controls. By these means the defect in patient A was localized to the membranes, since the neutrophil cytosol from the patient A could support O2+ production in normal membranes, whereas the neutrophil membranes from patient A were incapable of O2+ generation under any conditions (see below). The mutation in patient B forms part of the region postulated to be the NADPH-pyrophosphate binding loop(3Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C. Rosen H. Scrace G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this mutation might increase the Km of the oxidase for NADPH to such an extent that no activity would be seen in whole PMN (where the NADPH concentration is 34 μM(24Sparkman T.B. Johns T. Engerson T. Jones H.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 846: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar)) or under the conditions normally employed in the cell-free assay (160 μM NADPH). However, no superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reductase activity could be obtained at concentrations of NADPH up to 3 mM using membranes from either patient A or B. Above this concentration the rate of superoxide dismutase-insensitive activity made estimations of O2+-dependent activity unreliable. Localization of the defect in patient A to the neutrophil membrane suggested a genetic lesion in one of the genes encoding cytochrome b245 (either p22phox or gp91phox). Most commonly such mutations result in the absence of cytochrome, but reduced minus oxidized difference spectra of Triton X-100 extracts of neutrophils isolated on three different occasions from patient A, disclosed the presence of normal quantities of cytochrome b245 (51.8, 68.6, and 62.7 pmol/107 cells, compared with 59.8, 67.3, and 63.7 pmol/107 cells for normal controls processed in parallel). On first inspection, the absorbance maxima of the patient's cytochrome appeared grossly normal, but it was noted that the Soret band of the reduced minus oxidized spectrum was shifted slightly toward the red. In order to examine the cytochrome spectrum in more detail, 2% OG extracts were made of neutrophil plasma membrane fractions, and the absolute oxidized, absolute reduced (Fig. 1B) and reduced minus oxidized (Fig. 1A) difference spectra determined. The Soret band of the oxidized cytochrome b245 of patient A is shifted 1 nm hypsochromically from 414.6 to 413.6 nm. The reduced spectrum is shifted bathochromatically, from 426 to 426.5 nm. As a result, the Soret peak and trough are shifted in the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum from 427 to 427.5 nm (peak) and from 412 to 411.6 nm (trough). No differences in absorption maxima were observed for the α (558 nm) or β(529 nm) bands. The ratio of cytochrome b245 Soret/γ absorbance was not significantly altered in the patient. In contrast, patient B (with a Pro415→ His mutation in gp91phox) had no apparent abnormalities in any of the cytochrome b245 visible absorption spectra (Refs. 11, 25, and 26 and this work). Cytochrome b245 has been shown to bind CO with low affinity(27Cross A.R. Higson F.K. Jones O.T.G. Harper A.M. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As a further probe of the heme environment of the two mutant cytochromes b245, the ability of each cytochrome to form a complex with CO was compared with that of normal cytochrome b245. In all three cases, CO was bound weakly with 30-40% of the cytochrome in each sample forming a CO complex (not shown). As a further test of cytochrome function, the ability of the reduced cytochrome to become reoxidized by atmospheric oxygen was approximated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In all cases, cytochrome b245 was fully reoxidized within 30 s of mixing in air. Immunochemical methods confirmed the presence of cytochrome b245 in the neutrophils of CGD patient A and patient B (with the Pro415→ His mutation in gp91phox). As shown in Fig. 2, neutrophil plasma membrane fractions from both patients contained both the p22phox and gp91phox subunits of the cytochrome. Although the amount of cytochrome present in the patients neutrophils and plasma membranes was normal as determined by visible spectroscopy of the heme (see above and Table 1), and the same preparations of membranes were used for both spectroscopic determination of cytochrome b245 and immunostaining, the apparent intensity of the immunostaining of the gp91phox bands in both patients A and B was unexpectedly decreased. The peptide used to raise the gp91phox antibody used in these experiments did not correspond with the regions of either mutation (see below and “Experimental Procedures”). Based on the localization of the defect in patient A to the membrane, the shifts in the Soret absorbance band of the cytochrome b245 spectrum, and the X-linked inheritance of the disease, we considered the underlying mutation in patient A was most likely to reside in the gene for gp91phox. Consequently, genomic DNA from the patient was sequenced revealing a single base substitution of a cytosine for guanine 173 in exon 2 of gp91phox (AGG → ACG). The predicted effect of this mutation is the nonconservative replacement of arginine 54 with a serine residue. This is unlikely to be a polymorphism as it has not been observed in more than 200 normal and CGD patients alleles evaluated at Scripps. No other abnormalities in the sequence were detected. The patients mother and two sisters were found to be heterozygous for the mutation, in keeping with their NBT test results as reported to us, other family members; including another sister, had normal gp91phox sequences and NBT tests. We have previously shown that the absence of cytochrome b245, in both the X91° and A22° forms of CGD, prevents the association of both p47phox and p67phox with the plasma membrane fraction of neutrophils(17Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In the case of patient A we were interested in determining if the Arg54→ Ser mutation, which leads to normal levels of nonfunctional cytochrome b245, disrupted the assembly of cytosolic components at the membrane. As shown in Fig. 3, translocation of p47phox and p67phox was normal in patient A, with both proteins appearing in the particulate (pellet) fraction upon stimulation of the normal and CGD neutrophils with PMA. Thus the mutation that renders the cytochrome inactive does not appear to disrupt the interaction with other oxidase components. We have recently described a dye (INT) reductase (diaphorase) activity associated with NADPH oxidase (5Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21448-21454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and have provided evidence that electrons are transferred to the dye at the level of the FAD redox center(5Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21448-21454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cross A.R. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6543-6548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). INT diaphorase activity was absent from the membranes of patients with X91° or A22° forms of CGD (in which there is an absence of cytochrome b245 heme and a marked decrease or absence of flavin). We have examined the ability of the two X91+ CGD patients neutrophil membranes to support INT reductase activity in the cell-free activation system (Table 1). The X91+ patients A and B (who have normal levels of both cytochrome b245 and flavin) differ with regard to diaphorase activity, patient A has completely normal activity, whereas patient B has close to zero activity, typical of that of cytochrome-deficient membranes (Table 2). The cytosol from both patients was capable of supporting normal levels of dye-reductase activity in normal membranes, demonstrating the defect was cytochrome-associated. This suggests that the mutation in each of these patients affects different points in the pathway of electron flow, despite the fact that they affect the same (gp91phox) subunit of cytochrome b245. We have recently provided evidence that electrons are transferred to INT from the FAD center of NADPH oxidase(5Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21448-21454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that in patient B, electrons from NADPH cannot be transferred to the flavin, whereas in patient A, the flavin center can become reduced and electrons can be transferred to INT, but electrons cannot flow to oxygen. This could arise either because cytochrome b245 does not become reduced or because the reduced cytochrome does not react with oxygen. In order to resolve this question we examined the ability of the heme and flavin redox centers of the patients' cytochrome b245 to undergo reduction in the cell-free activation system in the presence of NADPH, using the methods we have developed previously(23Cross A.R. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6543-6548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In accord with the results of the INT diaphorase experiment, in patient A the NADPH oxidase-associated flavin underwent reduction in the cell-free activation system in the presence of NADPH (Fig. 4). In contrast, there was no observable reduction of flavin in the case of patient B (not shown). In neither patient was there any evidence for the reduction of cytochrome b245, unlike that observed in extracts of normal membranes (Fig. 4, trace a). We have recently provided evidence that p67phox and p47phox have individual roles in controlling electron flow in NADPH oxidase. We showed that the presence of p67phox is sufficient, in the absence of p47phox, to activate NADPH-oxidase to a state were electrons reduce the flavin center of the oxidase, but p47phox was required for electron transfer to continue to the heme center. Consistent with that proposal, we found that p47phox-deficient cytosol was capable of inducing electron flow into the flavin redox center of NADPH oxidase in extracts of the neutrophil membranes of patient A (Fig. 4, trace c).Table II Open table in a new tab The results reported above identify mutations in gp91phox that give insight into the functions of particular regions of the protein. The Arg54→ Ser mutation in patient A is in a region of gp91phox that is predicted to be on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, close to a transmembranous domain. The result of this mutation appears to mainly effect the function of the heme moiety of cytochrome b245 rather than the NADPH-binding or flavin-binding regions since: (a) there is a subtle shift in the optical absorbance properties of the heme; (b) the heme fails to become reduced on activation but the flavin is reduced normally; (c) the flavin is functional with regard to INT diaphorase activity; and (d) there is a high level of DCFH-DA fluorescence (possibly by autoxidation of reduced flavin generating intracellular H2O2 as we have recently proposed).4 The ability of the FAD to donate electrons to external acceptors is probably the cause of the slight positive staining observed in the NBT slide test of patient A. We (and others) have previously speculated that at least part of the NBT reduction seen in the NBT slide test, although NADPH-oxidase dependent, is O2+-independent, since NBT reduction is only partly inhibited by saturating concentrations of superoxide dismutase or under anaerobic conditions(28Briggs R.T. Drath D.B. Karnovsky M.L. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 566-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 29Johnston R.B. Keele B.B. Misra H.P. Lehmeyer J.E. Webb L.S. Baehner R.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 55: 1357-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 30Baehner R.L. Boxer L.A. Davis J. Blood. 1976; 48: 309-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that the PMNs of patient A display a degree of NBT reduction in the absence of O2+ production supports this proposal. In contrast to patient A, patient B has a mutation that appears to principally effect the flavin and/or NADPH-binding domains, since (a) the physicochemical properties of the heme appear normal with regard to spectrum, redox potential, and CO binding ((26Hurst J.K. Loehr T.M. Curnutte J.T. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1627-1634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and this work); (b) the flavin does not become reduced on activation of NADPH oxidase; (c) no diaphorase activity is seen with INT (or NBT staining in the slide test); and (d) the intracellular oxidant production measured by DCFH-DA fluorescence is low. These findings are consistent with the proposal that the mutation in this patient is within a NADPH-pyrophosphate binding loop that was identified by comparison of the sequence of gp91phox with the sequences of enzymes of the ferredoxin NADP+ reductase class(3Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C. Rosen H. Scrace G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 4Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L.

Commun. 1992; 186: 1368-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The experiments described above support the proposal that NADPH-derived electrons do not reduce the flavin center of patient B, and electrons cannot pass from the flavin to cytochrome b245 in patient A. The correlation of INT reductase activity with the ability of NADPH oxidase-associated FAD to become reduced in neutrophil membrane extracts from patient A is strong confirmatory evidence that the diaphorase activity we have previously identified is due to electron transfer from the reduced FAD to INT. Furthermore, the ability of p47phox-deficient cytosol to permit electrons to reduce the flavin in this patient provides further support for our proposal that p47phox and p67phox have separate roles in the control of electron flow in NADPH oxidase. Recently, another X91+ CGD patient was reported with a mutation resulting in the substitution of a glycine residue for Asp500 toward the C terminus of gp91phox(32Roos D. Immunol. Rev. 1994; 138: 121-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The functional defect in this patient apparently arises from the failure of the cytosolic factors to translocate to the membrane during the activation process. The C terminus of gp91phox has previously been implicated as being essential for translocation of the cytosolic factors p67phox and p47phox and activation of NADPH oxidase(17Heyworth P.G.

The presence of PC1/3 and PC2 in secretory vesicles of bovine adrenal medulla (chromaffin granules) implicates their role in the processing the precursors of enkephalin, neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, and other neuropeptides that are present in chromaffin granules. In this study, PC1/3 and PC2 were purified to apparent homogeneity from the soluble fraction of chromaffin granules by chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-200, pepstatin A-agarose, and anti-PC1/3 or anti-PC2 immunoaffinity resins. PC1/3 and PC2 were monitored during purification by measuring proteolytic activities with 35S-enkephalin precursor and Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-methylcoumarin amide (MCA) substrates and by following PC1/3 and PC2 immunoreactivity with specific anti-PC1/3 and anti-PC2 sera generated in this study. Purified PC1/3 and PC2 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels each show a molecular mass of 66 kDa. PC2 in the soluble fraction of chromaffin granules was present at 5- and 10-fold higher enzyme protein and activity, respectively, compared with that of PC1/3. PC1/3 and PC2 cleaved paired basic and monobasic sites within peptide-MCA substrates, with Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA and pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA as the most effectively cleaved peptides tested. PC1/3 and PC2 showed pH optima of 6.5 and 7.0, respectively. Kinetic studies indicated apparent Km values for hydrolysis of Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA as 66 and 40 μM, with Vmax values of 255 and 353 nmol/h/mg for PC1/3 and PC2, respectively. Specificity of the PC enzymes for dibasic sites was confirmed by potent inhibition by the active site-directed peptide inhibitors (D-Tyr)-Glu-Phe-Lys-Arg-CH2Cl and Ac-Arg-Arg-CH2Cl. Inhibition by EGTA and activation by Ca2+ indicated PC1/3 and PC2 as Ca2+-dependent proteases. In addition, PC enzymes were activated by dithiothreitol and inhibited by thiol-blocking reagents, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and mercuric chloride.

We studied the regulation of ribosomal RNA synthesis and the levels of RNA polymerase I and the ribosomal DNA transcription factor, UBF, during norepinephrine-induced hypertrophy of contraction-arrested neonatal cardiomyocytes in culture. Nuclear run-on assays and Western blots demonstrated that, concomitant with hypertrophy, norepinephrine (1 μM) increased the rate of ribosomal DNA transcription, without causing an increase in the amount of RNA polymerase I. However, the elevated rate of rRNA synthesis was accompanied by an increased cellular content of UBF protein as determined by Western analysis. Northern blots demonstrated norepinephrine-induced increases in UBF mRNA in neonatal cardiomyocytes indicating that the response was regulated, at least in part, at the pretranslational stage. Both α- and β-adrenergic agents increased the level of UBF mRNA. The β-adrenergic response was mimicked by forskolin (1 μM) and the cyclic AMP analog dibutyryl cAMP (10 μM). However, activation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (0.1 μM) did not increase expression of UBF.

We previously reported that kinase-deficient TβRII (ΔkTβRII) blocks TGFβ-dependent transcription in cardiac myocytes. It is controversial whether both receptors are needed in all cells for gene regulation by TGFβ or whether they mediate distinct subsets of TGFβ-dependent events. To resolve this uncertainty, TGFβ-dependent transcription was investigated in cardiac myocytes versus mink lung epithelial cells. 1) ΔkTβRII inhibits induction of a TGFβ-responsive reporter gene, in both cell backgrounds. 2) Charged-to-alanine mutations of key residues of the TβRII kinase, including consensus ATP binding and amino acid recognition motifs, are competent for binding but not transcriptional activation. Each inactive receptor inhibits TGFβ-dependent transcription in both cell types. 3) Kinase-deficient TβRI (ΔkTβRI) likewise impairs TGFβ-dependent transcription, less completely than ΔkTβRII; kinase-deficient activin type I receptor has no effect. 4) TGFβ-binding proteins in cardiac cells and Mv1Lu cells are comparable by affinity labeling and immunoprecipitation; however, Mv1Lu cells express up to 3-fold higher levels of TβRII and TβRI.

For the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in acute desensitization. Several groups have studied the role of PKC using phorbol esters to stimulate PKC activity(21Brown K.D. Blakeley D.M. Hamon M.H. Laurie S. Corps A.N. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Swope S.L. Schonbrunn A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 758-766PubMed Google Scholar). They found that short exposures to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) caused desensitization of bombesin-induced inositol phosphate generation without diminishing 125I-Tyr4-bombesin binding, implying that PKC can cause acute desensitization without reducing the number of GRP-Rs on the cell surface. More recently, while studying desensitization of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) generation, both Frankel and Viallet (23Frankel A. Viallet J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 398-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and Walsh et al.(24Walsh J.H. Bouzyk M. Rozengurt E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have shown that inhibition of PKC prevented phorbol ester- but not bombesin-induced desensitization. This suggests that PKC activation may not be a physiologically relevant mechanism for agonist-induced acute desensitization of the GRP-R, raising the possibility that other kinases may be involved in acute desensitization of the GRP-R. Neither study, however, directly shows that the GRP-R itself is a target for these kinases. In this study, we examined whether or not the GRP-R is actually phosphorylated in response to agonist binding, and if this phosphorylation is dependent upon PKC. The results presented here show that the GRP-R is rapidly phosphorylated after agonist binding and that this phosphorylation does not require PKC.

Stably transfected cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 300 μg/ml G-418 and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 125I-Tyr4-bombesin (2000 Ci/mmol) was prepared using IODOGEN and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously(31Wang L.-H. Mantey S.A. Lin J.-F. Frucht H. Jensen R.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1175: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).

Nonspecific binding of 125I-Tyr4-bombesin was defined as the amount of radioactivity associated with cells in the presence of 1 μM bombesin. Analysis of binding data was performed using the least squares curve-fitting program LIGAND(32Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar).

Curve fitting was done using first order kinetics. 3 × 106 cells were plated into 100 × 20-mm tissue culture dishes. The following day the medium was removed, and the dishes were washed twice with DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS. The dishes were then incubated at 37°C for 14 min in 5 ml of DMEM + 0.5% FBS containing 1 μM Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The dishes were washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer, 3 ml of binding buffer were added to the dish, and the cells were detached by scraping. The cells were disaggregated by pipetting, pelleted in a tabletop centrifuge, and resuspended in 6 ml of binding buffer. The cell suspension was placed on ice until ready for use. When ready, 2 ml of cell suspension were repelleted and resuspended in binding buffer. The cells were warmed in a 37°C water bath for 2.5 min, then added to a quartz cuvette which was placed into a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B luminescence spectrometer for fluorescence monitoring using an excitation wavelength of 336 nm and emission wavelength of 510 nm. The cells were continually stirred using a Hellma Cuv-o-stir model 333 (Hellma, Jamaica, NY), and maintained at 37°C by connecting the cuvette holder to a HAAKE water bath (HAAKE, Inc., Paramus, NJ). After 3 min (to allow the cells to equilibrate), hormones were added as indicated in the text and figure legends. [Ca2+]i was calculated using the formula [Ca2+]i in mM = K(F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F), where F was the fluorescence at the unknown [Ca2+]i, Fmax the fluorescence after addition of 0.05% Triton X-100, Fmin the fluorescence after addition of 25 mM EGTA, and K = 220 nM(34Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Increases in [Ca2+]i were calculated as peak values minus baseline and reported as mean ± S.D. for representative triplicates performed over the course of 2 days. A peptide was synthesized (CVEGNIHVKKQIESRKR) by Peptide Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD) corresponding to a portion of the third intracellular loop of the mouse and human GRP-R. The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as described previously (35Green N. Alexander H. Olson A. Alexander S. Shinnick T.M. Sutcliffe J.G. Lerner R.A.

The results described throughout this publication were obtained with the antiserum from rabbit no. 3. After the cells were treated as described below and in the figure legends, the cell culture dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. When used for phosphorylation studies, the saline was supplemented with 10 mM NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 18.4 μg/ml sodium vanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Next, 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 330 mM sucrose) per 20 cm2 of cell culture dish surface area was added to the dish. For phosphorylation assays, this buffer was supplemented as was the phosphate-buffered saline wash buffer on the day of use. For Western blotting, only the protease inhibitors were added. The cells were scraped off the dish, placed in a 15-ml tube, and homogenized for 15 s twice at setting no. 6 with a Polytron model PT 10/35 homogenizer (Brinkmann) using Polytron's PTA 7 probe. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 4°C for 8 min at 1500 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was removed and spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C in a tabletop ultracentrifuge. The resulting supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was redissolved in the appropriate buffer. Cells were grown to confluence in 175-cm2 flasks. Membranes were prepared as described above, redissolved in sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% sucrose, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 60 mM Tris, pH 6.8), and protein content was determined with the BCA protein assay by Pierce using the manufacturer's instructions. 50 μg of protein from each sample were added per lane in a precast 1 × 10-mm thick well polyacrylamide gel (Novex) and electrophoresed in running buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS) at 120 V until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. Next, the protein was transferred onto a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane at 25 V overnight in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 192 mM glycine, 20% MeOH) at 4°C. Immunoblotting was performed at room temperature as described previously(36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 474-504Google Scholar). Briefly, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 1 h in Blotto (47.4 mM Tris, pH 8, 1.9 mM CaCl2, 75.8 mM NaCl, 5% (w/v) non-fat milk, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) plus 20% goat serum, incubated for 1 h in antiserum diluted 1:300 with Blotto, washed twice with Blotto for 15 min each, incubated for 1 h in horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Life Science, Buckinghamshire, UK) diluted 1:1000 with Blotto, washed twice with Blotto, and then twice with buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 8, 2 mM CaCl2, 80 mM NaCl). All washes were for 15 min. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.) using the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were prepared, and protein content was determined as described for Western blotting studies. Cell membranes were resuspended in a microcentrifuge tube at 2 mg/ml in N-glycanase buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.7, 50 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, and 0.4% 2-mercaptoethanol) and denatured at 95°C for 5 min. 60 μl of denatured sample were combined with 30 μl of 7.5% Nonidet P-40, 7.2 μl of N-glycanase, and 82.8 μl of H2O. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for the indicated time, and the reaction was stopped with 60 μl of 4 × sample buffer. 3 × 106 cells/dish were seeded into 100 × 20-mm tissue culture dishes and incubated in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37°C overnight (unless otherwise noted). The following day, the cells were incubated in phosphate-free DMEM with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 30 min. Next, this medium was removed and replaced with 5 ml of the same medium supplemented with 250 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h (or the time noted in the figure legends). Compounds were then added as described in the figure legends. Cell membranes were prepared as described above, redissolved in 300 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8) supplemented with 10 mM NaF, 18.4 μg/ml sodium vanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. All further steps were performed at 4°C. The solution was precleared by adding 5 μl of normal rabbit serum and 7.5 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Oncogene Science, Manhasset, NY) and mixing in a rotator for 30 min. Precipitated material was then removed by centrifuging at 15,000 rpm for 5 min. Preclearing was then repeated. The supernatant was placed in a new tube, 5 μl of rabbit no. 3 antiserum added, and the solution was mixed for 1 h. 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose were added and mixed overnight. The next day the tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 rpm, the supernatant was discarded, and the agarose beads were washed by incubating with 600 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer with mixing for 10 min. The tubes were then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, the radioimmune precipitation buffer removed, and the wash repeated a total of four times. A final wash followed with 600 μl of a 10 mM Tris and 140 mM NaCl solution. After the final wash was removed, 30 μl of 2 × sample buffer were added to each sample. The tube was vortexed, incubated at 95°C for 5 min to dissociate the bound proteins from the beads, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 rpm. 25 μl of the supernatant from each sample were loaded into the precast gels. After SDS-PAGE (as described above) the gel was fixed in a 30% MeOH, 10% acetic acid solution, dried for 2 h, and exposed to x-ray film or a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) screen. Quantification of phosphorylated GRP-R was accomplished by use of a PhosphorImager. For each gel analyzed, a two-row grid was created long enough to include all the samples. Each rectangle in the lower row encompassed the receptor signal from one sample, and the upper row, which encompassed the same area above the receptor signal, was used as an intrasample background. Each lane's background was subtracted from the corresponding receptor signal to generate the signal reported in the figures. Phosphorylation of the GRP-R, membrane preparation, immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE were performed as described above. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described previously(37Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 38Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Relative positions of the phosphoamino acids were determined following ninhydrin (0.2% in acetone) visualization, and the plate was exposed to either x-ray film or a PhosphorImager screen. Quantification of the phosphoamino acids was accomplished using a PhosphorImager. Six equally sized elliptical regions were created which were large enough to individually include the area covered by the most diffuse phosphoamino acid. Ellipses were placed so as to encompass each of the three phosphoamino acid signals. In addition, the three other ellipses were placed adjacent to the phosphoamino acid signals for background determinations. These backgrounds were averaged, and the average was subtracted from the values of the scanned phosphoamino acids. The procedure was modified from Chakravarthy et al.(39Chakravarthy B.R. Bussey A. Whitfield J.F. Sikorska M. Williams R.E. Durkin J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) using the MARCKS PKC site peptide FKKSFKL-NH2 (synthesized in house). Cells were plated and treated as described in the figure legends. Membranes were prepared and redissolved in 100 μl of ice-cold 2 × buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 μM CaCl2, 0.2 mM NaVO4, 0.2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mM NaF supplemented with 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mM PMSF just before use). After determining the protein concentration, 10 μg of membrane protein was added into a microcentrifuge tube with 30 μl of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 μl of 1 mM MARCKS PKC site peptide in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 μl of ATP solution containing 0.5 mM unlabeled ATP, and 0.15 mCi/ml [32P]ATP in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, made up to a final volume of 100 μl with 2 × buffer. Experiments were performed in triplicate including a set of tubes for background determination containing 50 μl of 2 × buffer and no membrane. Reactions were incubated in a heating block at 30°C for 10 min with vigorous shaking. The reactions were stopped with 10 μl of 5% acetic acid, and the tubes were spun in a refrigerated centrifuge for 5 min at 15,000 rpm. 50 μl of the reaction volume were spotted onto 2.25-cm2 pieces of P81 paper (Whatman). The papers were then repeatedly washed in 200-300 ml of 5% acetic acid for 10 min until the background (no membrane) papers had counts less than 400 cpm as determined with a Geiger counter. The papers were air-dried overnight and then counted by liquid scintillation. Several approaches were used concurrently in an attempt to create an antibody specific for the GRP-R to study acute phosphorylation. At the same time as the antisera to the peptide derived from the third loop of the GRP-R were being prepared, mutant GRP-Rs were synthesized with a myc epitope at either the 5′ (5′ET) or 3′ (3′ET) end of the receptor. Tagging proteins with this epitope was previously shown to be useful for Western blot analysis (26Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar). When stable transfectants of these constructs were made in Balb 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, clones were isolated (5′ET4 and 3′ET2) which expressed much higher levels (>106 receptors/cell) of the GRP-R than either BNR-11, a transfectant with the wild-type GRP-R expressed in Balb cells (~2 × 105 receptors/cell), or Swiss 3T3 cells (~5 × 104 receptors/cell). The 5′ET4 and 3′ET2 cell lines behaved similarly to BNR-11 in ligand affinity, effector coupling, internalization and desensitization assays. As shown in Fig. 1A, all three receptors internalized rapidly and to a similar degree, with 70-80% of cell associated radiolabeled bombesin in acid resistant pools by 30 min. Therefore, internalization of the GRP-R is not impaired by the epitope tagging of either end of the receptor. Also, all three receptors exhibited similar patterns of ligand-induced [Ca2+]i increases. Addition of 5 nM bombesin lead to an increase in [Ca2+]i of 473 ± 146 nM in BNR-11, 357 ± 37 nM in 3′ET2, and 334 ± 85 nM in 5′ET4. There was complete desensitization in all cell lines to a subsequent addition of 5 nM bombesin. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, B and C, sequential addition of 0.5 nM bombesin to all three cell lines resulted in similar patterns of desensitization. These studies indicate that addition of the myc epitope to either the amino or carboxyl terminus of the mouse GRP-R does not significantly effect any receptor function. Western blots of membrane preparations from 5′ET4 and 3′ET2 using the monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Oncogene Science, Manhasset, NY) which is specific for the myc epitope, provided only weak signals from the mutant receptors, and attempts at immunoprecipitation with 9E10 were unsuccessful (results not shown). After unsuccessful attempts with the 9E10 anti-myc monoclonal antibody, attention was then focused on polyclonal antisera derived from rabbits immunized with a peptide derived from the GRP-R third intracellular loop linked via an amino-terminal cysteine to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The rabbit producing the highest titer antiserum detected the GRP-R as a broad band of approximately 70-90 kDa in a variety of GRP-R-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). The intensity of the signal in each cell line appeared proportional to the number of receptors (noted above) in these cell lines and no signal was detected in untransfected Balb cells. Two other bands (~23 and 45 kDa) were present in all cell lines with equal intensity and are presumed to be nonspecific since they are unrelated to levels of GRP-R expression and are not efficiently competed with the immunizing peptide (Fig. 3C).Figure 3:Bombesin-induced phosphorylation of the GRP-R. A, different cell lines were plated in 100 × 20-mm dishes. The following day the cells were labeled with 250 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h then incubated in the presence (+) or absence(-) of 100 nM bombesin for 10 min at 37°C. Membranes were prepared and immunoprecipitations performed using the GRP-R antiserum (as under “Experimental Procedures”). Immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was fixed and dried and then exposed to an x-ray film for 50 h. The position of GRP-R is indicated. B, GRP-R-transfected Balb cells (5′ET4) were plated in 150 × 25-mm dishes. The next day they were incubated in the presence (+) or absence(-) of 100 nM bombesin for 10 min at 37°C. Membranes were prepared, and 50 μg of membrane protein from each sample were resolved on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE, transferred overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with a 1:300 dilution of rabbit no. 3 antiserum, and developed by chemiluminescence. C, GRP-R transfected Balb cells (5′ET4) were plated in 150 × 25-mm dishes. The following day the cells were labeled with 250 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h, then incubated in the presence (+) or absence(-) of 100 nM bombesin for 10 min at 37°C. Membranes were prepared and immunoprecipitations performed using the GRP-R antiserum which had been preincubated overnight at 4°C with the indicated amounts of the peptide used for the generation of the antiserum. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was fixed and dried and then exposed to an x-ray film for 9 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Treatment with N-glycanase to remove oligosaccharides eliminated the broad 70-90-kDa band from the lane with the GRP-R (-, 3′ET2), produced a doublet at approximately 40 kDa, and had no effect on the nonspecific bands expressed in untransfected Balb cells (Fig. 2B). Although in this experiment the cumulative intensities differed between the N-glycanase-treated (40 kDa) and untreated (70-90 kDa) receptor bands, shorter incubations in N-glycanase (30-60 min) produced a 40-kDa receptor band of similar cumulative intensity to the 70-90-kDa receptor band in the untreated lanes (not shown). The N-glycanase-induced decrease in receptor mass is consistent with previous studies establishing that the GRP-R is a glycoprotein with asparagine-linked sugar chains(30Kris R.M. Hazan R.

The molecular weight of the deglycosylated receptor is comparable to the predicted molecular weight of the GRP-R from the cDNA sequence(27Battey J.F. Way J. C"

Pluripotent bone marrow stem cells can differentiate into members of various hematopoietic lineages. This process includes tissue-specific transcriptional regulation of a complement of genes that characterizes each lineage. Granulocytes and monocyte/macrophages comprise the category of mature, terminally differentiated phagocytic cells and are characterized by the ability to generate toxic free-radicals via the respiratory burst. Respiratory burst activity requires a group of signaling components and the catalytic unit, the NADPH-dependent oxidase(1Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem.

Recent work has provided insight into the tissue-specific expression of the gp91-phox gene(9Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Skalnik D.G. Dorfman D.M. Perkins A.S. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8505-8509Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that 450 base pairs (bp) of the 5′-flank of the human gp91-phox gene is adequate to direct expression of a reporter gene specifically in a subset of monocyte/macrophages in transgenic mice(10Skalnik D.G. Dorfman D.M. Perkins A.S. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8505-8509Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These data suggest that important regulatory elements that control lineage and differentiation-specific expression of gp91-phox are present within the proximal 450 bp of the gp91-phox promoter. Similar tissue distribution of transgene transcription is observed with constructs containing up to 2.6 kilobase pairs of the proximal gp91-phox promoter(10Skalnik D.G. Dorfman D.M. Perkins A.S. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8505-8509Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The absence of detectable reporter gene expression in the majority of myelomonocytic cells suggests that additional regulatory elements are required to direct appropriate transcription in the full complement of phagocytic cells. The study of two kindreds with a novel form of X-linked CGD also suggests the existence of important cis-elements in the proximal promoter region of the gp91-phox gene. gp91-phox protein is absent in the majority of phagocytic cells, although a subset of phagocytes express gp91-phox normally in this variant form of the disease(11Woodman R.C. Newburger P.E. Anklesaria P. Erickson R.W. Rae J. Cohen M.S. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1995; 85: 231-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these kindreds carry a point mutation in the proximal promoter region of the gp91-phox gene(12Newburger P.E. Skalnik D.G. Hopkins P.J. Eklund E.A. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The point mutations in these kindreds are at −55 and −57 bp relative to the published transcription start site(13Royer-Pokora B. Kunkle L.M. Monaco A.P. Goff S.C. Newburger P.E. Baehner R.L. Cole F.S. Curnutte J.T. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1986; 322: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), and each specifically disrupts an interaction between the gp91-phox promoter and a DNA-binding protein (12Newburger P.E. Skalnik D.G. Hopkins P.J. Eklund E.A. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined in more detail the proximal gp91-phox promoter in an attempt to identify cis-elements and the DNA-binding proteins that interact with these elements, which mediate tissue-specific expression of gp91-phox in myelomonocytic cells. Previous studies relied on transgenic mice for functional analysis of gp91-phox promoter fragments. While this technique has the advantage of permitting promoter characterization in an authentic in vivo setting, the time and expense of this approach are disadvantages. We report here that IFN-γ induction of the gp91-phox gene can be studied using stable transfectants of the myeloid cell line PLB985(14Tucker K.A. Lilly M.B. Heck Jr., L. Rado T.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 372-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus providing a more rapid and convenient assay system with which to study this aspect of gp91-phox promoter function. The studies reported here reveal a cis-element in the proximal gp91-phox promoter that is necessary but not sufficient for IFN-γ induction of transcription and that co-localizes with promoter mutations identified in CGD patients. The −50 to −57 region of the gp91-phox promoter (5′-GAGGAAAT-3′) contains on the lower strand a sequence similar to the consensus binding sequence for the Ets protein family. The core motif for binding of Ets family members is 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′, with binding specificity of the various family members conferred by additional flanking sequences(15Zhang L. Lemarchandel V. Romeo P.-H. Ben-David Y. Greer P. Bernstein A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). Various Ets factors have recently been demonstrated to be essential for the transcription of myeloid and lymphoid-specific genes, including major histocompatibility class II I-Aβ(16Klemsz M.J.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7163-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In vitro assays reveal that a DNA-binding protein required for normal gp91-phox promoter function is largely restricted to cells of hematopoietic origin, shares an overlapping binding site with a ubiquitous CCAAT-binding protein, and exhibits a binding specificity distinct from previously described members of the Ets protein family. Cloning of the 450-bp proximal gp91-phox promoter fragment into a plasmid containing the genomic sequence for the human growth hormone (hGH) reporter gene has been previously described(9Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a mutant oligonucleotide-directed polymerase chain reaction technique as described by Vallette(21Vallette F. Mege E. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 725-733Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA synthesizer. The 450-bp fragment of the proximal gp91-phox promoter, cloned into pUC-19, was used as a template. Mutations were introduced by complementary synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing mutations of the promoter flanked by 20 nonmutated bases. The mutant oligonucleotide primers were used as the “right” and “left” inside primers for the first step reactions, the right and left outside primers were the universal sequencing primers for M13 DNA. Reaction products were isolated on native polyacrylamide gels in 90 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 90 mM borate, 2.5 mM EDTA (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.36-6.48Google Scholar) prior to the second-step polymerase chain reaction utilizing the two outside primers. Products of the second-step polymerase chain reaction were isolated on an agarose gel and subcloned into a plasmid vector. The nucleotide sequence of mutated 450-bp promoter fragments was determined on both strands using the Sequenase system (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Mutated gp91-phox promoter sequences were sub-cloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the hGH reporter gene plasmid vector (Nichols Institute, San Juan, Capistrano). A neomycin resistance gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter was inserted into the SalI site (TKneo cassette generously provided by Stuart Orkin, Boston Children's Hospital) in both parallel and anti-parallel orientation relative to the reporter gene. The orientation of the selectable marker did not affect reporter gene activity (data not shown). Plasmid for generating a riboprobe specific for the gp91-phox promoter-hGH reporter transgene mRNA was constructed by subcloning double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides into the Bluescript KS+ (Clontech, Palo Alto, California) transcription vector. Complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized that contain the proximal 38 bases of the gp91-phox promoter and the first 33 bases of hGH sequence. The oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into the HindIII and PstI sites of Bluescript KS+. The chicken γ-actin probe was a generous gift of Celeste Simon (University of Chicago). Oligonucleotides used as double stranded competitors and probes are as follows: gp91-phox wild-type −30 to −68 bp (9Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol.

Cancer Inst. 1972; 49: 891-895PubMed Google Scholar) were all obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). The myelomonoblastic cell line PLB985 (14Tucker K.A. Lilly M.B. Heck Jr., L. Rado T.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 372-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was generously provided by Thomas Rado (University of Alabama, Birmingham). The B-cell leukemia cell line CESS (37Bradley T.R. Pilkington G. Garson M. Hodgson G.S. Kraft N. Br. J. Haematol. 1982; 51: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was provided by Yu Chung Yang (Indiana University, Indianapolis). All cell lines were grown at 37°C and 5% CO2. With the exception of HepG2 and MOLT-4, all lines were carried in RPMI 1640 supplemented to 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.2 mM glutamine. HepG2 and MOLT-4 cell lines were grown in α-minimal Eagle's medium with supplements as above. Myeloid cell lines were differentiated by treatment with 0.1 μM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) for 48 h (macrophage differentiation), with 1 μM all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) for 24 h followed by 60 mM dimethylformamide for an additional 24 h (granulocyte differentiation), or treated with 500 units/ml human recombinant IFN-γ (Boehringer Mannheim) for 48 h. Stable transfectants carrying the neomycin resistance cassette were treated with 1000 units/ml human IFN-γ for 6 days with the cells kept continuously in log phase. Myeloid cell lines were transfected by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser (Bio-Rad). PLB985 cells growing in log phase were resuspended at a density of 4 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented as above plus 20% fetal bovine serum. Fifty μg of circular plasmid DNA containing a gp91-phox promoter-hGH reporter gene construct and the TKneo cassette was added to 800 μl of cells in an electroporation cuvette and pulsed at 0.24 mV and 960 microfarads. The cells were incubated for 20 min on ice, expanded into 10 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented as above plus 15% fetal bovine serum, and incubated overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2. The cells were selected for G418 resistance in the usual RPMI 1640 media supplemented with geneticin at an initial concentration of 0.5 mg of active drug/ml, increasing to 1.5 mg/ml over 2 weeks to select for high transgene copy number. Stable transfection was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from 5-8 × 105 tissue culture cells using the Elu-Quick system (Schleicher and Scheull) and probed for both the TKneo cassette and the promoter-reporter gene construct using formamide hybridization and random primer labeled probes(22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.36-6.48Google Scholar). Probes were labeled with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) per 100 ng of DNA template. Stably transfected cells treated with IFN-γ were compared with nontreated cells for expression of hGH. Stable pools were tested with IFN-γ stimulation over increasing time periods to determine an optimal time for stimulation of log phase cells. The IFN-γ response was maximal after 6 days of stimulation (data not shown). Titration of the dose of IFN-γ demonstrated a maximal effect (with a variety of lots) at 1000-1200 units/ml (data not shown). Multiple independent pools of cells were analyzed for each promoter construct. Assays for hGH were performed using a radio-immunoassay system from Nichols Laboratories (San Juan Capestrano, CA). Results of hGH assays were normalized for the number of trypan blue-excluding cells/ml of culture. Nuclear extracts were prepared from tissue culture cells growing in log phase by the method of Dignam (38Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. Fli-1 protein was produced by in vitro transcription/translation using the Riboprobe Gemini System and the Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid for producing Fli-1 protein was kindly provided by Mike Klemsz (Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN). Protein assays were performed by the method of Lowry (39Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit I (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Complementary double-stranded oligonucleotides were routinely subcloned into plasmids. DNA probes were produced by end labeling restriction digest fragments with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, DuPont NEN) per μg of plasmid DNA (about 1 pmol). Probes were isolated on a native polyacrylamide gel and recovered by ethanol precipitation. For DNase I protection assays and methylation interference assays, individual probes were synthesized for each strand. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (40Garner M.M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar) (EMSA) were performed in a 20-μl total volume with 2-4 μg of nuclear extract protein or 0.5-1 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate in a solution containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM potassium glutamate, 5 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI•dC) (Sigma). Nuclear extracts were preincubated for 15 min on ice with approximately a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide competitor (where indicated) followed by an additional 15 min on ice after the addition of 1-2 × 104 cpm of probe. Bound and free probe were separated by electrophoresis at 25 mA (constant current) on native 4% polyacrylamide gels (19:1) in 45 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 45 mM borate, 1.25 mM EDTA at 4°C. Gels were dried onto Whatman No. 3MM paper (Whatman), and autoradiograms were exposed at −70°C using intensifying screens. For antibody binding assays, nuclear extracts or rabbit reticulocyte lysate were incubated on ice in a 20-μl binding assay with 1 μg of an anti-ETS domain antibody raised against peptide corresponding to residues 362-374 of ets-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h either before or after the addition of oligonucleotide probe. Blocking assays were performed as above, but in the presence of 5-fold excess by weight of synthetic peptide, as per manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies directed against NF-Y (41Mantovani R. Pessara U. Tronche F. Li X.-Y. Knapp A.-M. Pasquali J.-L. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) were preincubated with nuclear extract for 15 min prior to the addition of probe. DNase I protection assays were performed using a binding reaction that was identical to that used for EMSA with the following exceptions. The total volume was 50 μl, the amount of nuclear extract protein was 8-20 μg, and the amount of probe was 1-3 × 105 cpm/sample. After the binding reaction was complete, the sample was incubated at room temperature for 1 min and supplemented to 10 mM magnesium chloride and 5 mM calcium chloride. The reaction was incubated for 1 min at room temperature and supplemented to 0.2-0.8 μg/ml with DNase I (Sigma) and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. The DNase I digestion was stopped by supplementing to 10 mM EDTA and 5% glycerol. Free and bound probe were separated on a 5% native gel as above. After electrophoresis, a wet autoradiogram was performed for 4 h at room temperature. Free and shifted probe bands were eluted from the gel (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 6.36-6.48Google Scholar) and ethanol precipitated. The probes were resuspended in 80% formamide loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel with a Maxam and Gilbert G+A sequencing ladder(42Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar). The gel was fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid and dried, and autoradiography was performed at −70°C with intensifying screens. Sequencing ladders for each strand were generated by piperidine (Fisher) cleavage of dimethyl sulfate (Aldrich)-methylated probe as described previously(43Brunelle A. Schleif R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6673-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Methylation interference assays were performed with partially methylated end-labeled probe(43Brunelle A. Schleif R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6673-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed as for DNase I protection assays, and free and bound probe were separated on 3.5% native polyacrylamide gels, recovered, and precipitated as above. Piperidine cleavage at G and A residues was performed as described(42Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar), and the probes analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gels as described for DNase I protection assays. Riboprobes were synthesized using the Riboprobe Gemini system (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmid DNA was restriction digested, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated prior to the in vitro transcription reaction. Probes were labeled with 50 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, DuPont NEN) per μg of initial plasmid DNA. After in vitro transcription, the probes were ethanol-precipitated and gel-isolated on a native polyacrylamide gel and recovered as described(44Melton D.A. Kreig P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4042) Google Scholar). Probes were resuspended in hybridization buffer (40 mM PIPES (pH 6.5), 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 80% formamide). Total RNA was extracted from tissue culture cells by the single-step extraction method as described previously (45Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 100% formamide(46Chomczynski P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3791-3792Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Annealing reactions were performed in hybridization buffer with 2-20 μg of total RNA (or yeast tRNA as a control) and 105 to 2 × 106 cpm of probe in a final volume of 30 μl and incubated for 16 h at 55°C. Elevation above this annealing temperature (up to 75°C) did not further reduce background. RNase digestion was performed at 37°C for 15 min in a total volume of 400 μl containing 40 μg/ml of RNase A (Boehringer Mannheim) and 700 units/ml RNase T1 (Boehringer Mannheim) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 M NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA. RNase digestion was terminated, and the protected fragments were analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel as described(47Weaver R.F. Weissman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1175-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The gel was fixed, and autoradiography performed as described above. Previous study of the gp91-phox gene demonstrated that 450 bp of proximal promoter is sufficient to direct transgene expression in a subset of monocyte/macrophages in transgenic mice(10Skalnik D.G. Dorfman D.M. Perkins A.S. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8505-8509Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To analyze the proximal gp91-phox promoter in more detail, stable transfectant pools of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line PLB985 were generated. Pools of transfectants were analyzed to compensate for possible integration site effects on the transcriptional activity of transfected sequences. Multiple independent pools were analyzed for each construct. A background of reporter gene expression is seen in promoterless transfectants (data not shown). This background transcription has been previously reported for transient transfectants of PLB985 cells with an identical vector and is presumably due to cryptic transcription initiation sites within the vector(9Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter gene expression was analyzed following IFN-γ stimulation and compared with unstimulated transfectants. IFN-γ stimulation of myeloid cell lines has previously been demonstrated to increase transcription of t"
https://openalex.org/W2005782039,"Stimulation of macrophages induces the “respiratory burst” response which is associated with the generation of superoxide (O2−), a drop in cytoplasmic pH, and a pronounced depolarization of the membrane potential. The purpose of the present studies was to determine whether an increase in O2− was temporally related to changes in membrane potential and transmembrane current. Release of O2− at the single cell level was photometrically monitored during phagocytosis of immune complexes while simultaneously measuring whole-cell current. Membrane depolarization and the generation of a non-selective current followed an increase in O2− production with a variable lag time which was correlated with the state of cellular maturation in culture. In the absence of phagocytosis, the exposure of macrophages to O2− generated by a xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction activated a non-selective current similar to that seen after phagocytosis. These results provide the first demonstration of the relationship between free radical release and the ensuing electrophysiological signaling events which are linked to particle engulfment in phagocytic cells.

The binding of particulate as well as soluble ligands to phagocytic membranes may result in particle phagocytosis, lysosomal enzyme release, and generation of a respiratory burst response. The ability to initiate a respiratory burst and thereby to produce reactive oxygen species, e.g. superoxide anion (O2−), 1The abbreviations used are: O2−superoxide anionDCFH-IC2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-labeled immune complexBSAbovine serum albuminNMDGN-methyl-D-glucamineHMDMhuman monocyte-derived macrophageFcRFc receptorDPIdiphenylene iodonium chloridePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. hydrogen peroxide, and singlet oxygen is central to the cytotoxic properties of phagocytes.

Activation of the respiratory burst in phagocytic cells has been shown to be closely associated with stimulus-induced changes in membrane potential. Studies with HL-60 cells, for example, have demonstrated that differentiating granulocytes gain the capacity for depolarization concomitantly with O2− production (Kitagawa et al., 1984). Moreover, when activated macrophages are cultured in vitro, the heightened membrane depolarization and respiratory burst reactivity are coincidentally lost (Kitagawa and Johnston, 1986). A close correlation between the development of depolarization and cytotoxic activities in normal myeloid cells further emphasizes that membrane potential changes and functional reactivity are coupled (Newburger et al., 1979). Stimulus-induced changes in membrane potential have been reported to antecede changes in cellular oxidative metabolism in granulocytes (Jones et al., 1981; Korchak and Weissman, 1978) suggesting that depolarization may be an important element in the signal transduction cascade leading from membrane receptor ligation to an increase in NADPH oxidase activity. In an attempt to elucidate the molecular basis of the stimulus-induced changes in membrane potential that are associated with the initiation of the respiratory burst, we examined the relationship between the free radical release, transmembrane current, and membrane potential changes following receptor-mediated phagocytosis in peripheral mononuclear cells maintained in culture. We provide evidence that superoxide release subsequent to the phagocytosis of immune complexes is associated with activation of a calcium-dependent, non-selective current, and membrane depolarization. The apparent superoxide-induced changes in membrane potential may contribute to the depression of macrophage respiratory burst capacity observed following FcR-mediated phagocytosis. DCFH-IC was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) as Fc-Oxyburst®. Fibronectin was obtained from Collaborative Research Inc. (Bedford, MA). Diphenylene iodonium chloride was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Downsview, Ontario, Canada). Human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) isolated from peripheral blood were cultured in Teflon vials for up to 2 weeks as described previously (Nelson et al., 1990). Cells were plated on glass-bottom recording dishes which were coated with 2% gelatin followed by 10 μg/ml fibronectin. Whole-cell recordings from HMDM membranes were obtained using the techniques of Hamill et al.(1981). A dish containing cultured cells was placed in a chamber on the movable stage of an inverted microscope equipped with phase-contrast optics. Experiments involving the phagocytic uptake of the immune complex fluorescent dye conjugate (DCFH-IC) were performed at elevated temperature (33°C) using a temperature controlled stage (Brook Industries, Lake Villa, IL). Recording pipettes were formed from soda lime glass (Blue-Dot Hematocrit Glass, Fisher) using a horizontal puller (model P-87, Sutter Instruments, San Rafael, CA). Whole-cell currents were obtained using a List EPC-7 (List Electronic, Darmstadt, West Germany) voltage clamp. The output of the current-to-voltage converter was filtered through a low pass filter at 500 Hz. The current signal was sampled at 1 kHz by a 12-bit A/D converter (Data Translation 2818, Marlborough, MA.) and written into data files using an IBM-AT. Whole-cell recordings were made in an external recording solution that contained 140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES buffered to pH 7.4. The pipette solution contained 144 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 11 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES buffered to pH 7.2. Solution osmolarities were monitored using a vapor pressure osmometer (model 5500, Wesco, Logan, UT). For the selectivity studies, the pipette solution contained 40 mM NaCl, 100 mM NMDG-glutamate, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA buffered to pH 7.2. The bath solution was the standard external recording solution. The equilibrium potentials for a perfectly cation- or anion-selective conductance under these ionic conditions were +31 mV and −31 mV, respectively. Experiments performed in the asymmetric salt solutions allowed us to separate leak current from current carried by monovalent cations. In studies examining the relative cation selectivity of the current, NaCl in the bathing solution was replaced with the chloride salts of either K+, Cs+, Li+, or NMDG. Superoxide production following phagocytosis of the DCFH-labeled immune complexes was monitored directly using a PTI D104 (Photon Technologies International, South Brunswick, NJ). The PTI D104 is a filter-based illumination system consisting of a 75-watt xenon arc lamp and a variable speed reflective optical chopper under computer control. Excitation light at 490 nm was deflected with a 510-nm dichroic mirror. Emitted fluorescence filtered at 525 nm was collected by a Hammamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube and photon-counting photometer through a variable rectangular aperture roughly equal to the area of the single cell. Photomultiplier output was sampled at 20 Hz and processed using a PTI interface on a 386/20 personal computer. Cells were illuminated at 490 nm using a slewing monochromator and a xenon-light source as described above. In the imaging experiments, a 40 × (Nikon Fluor, N.A. 1.3) oil immersion objective was used to gather fluorescence data from a number of cells in the field of view. Fluorescence emission at 525 nm was collected with a Hammamatsu c2400 SIT video camera connected to a PTI image processor. Individual frames were summed (number of frames summed depended on fluorescence intensity) and averaged. Frame averages were collected at 30-s intervals following exposure of the cell to the dye-coupled immune complexes. Summary data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean with the number of experiments in parentheses. Respiratory burst activation in HMDMs was triggered and monitored photometrically through detection of superoxide using the reduced fluorochrome DCFH covalently linked to bovine serum albumin (BSA)-anti-BSA immunoglobulin immune complexes. The Fc receptor-mediated binding and phagocytosis of the fluorochrome-coupled derivative (DCFH-IC) transfers the conjugate to the phagocytic vacuole. The presence of oxygen metabolites released into the phagocytic vacuole following NADPH-oxidative activation oxidizes DCFH to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein. Flow cytometric studies on peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes have previously shown that the DCFH-IC conjugate is capable of monitoring the kinetics of the production of activated oxygen species within the phagocytic vacuoles of neutrophils (Ryan et al., 1990). To gain insight into the interrelationship between free radical release and ion channel activation in mononuclear cells during activation, whole-cell voltage clamp experiments were carried out in physiological solutions during phagocytosis of DCFH-ICs. Fig. 1 shows the time-dependent increase in membrane current following exposure of a representative cell to the fluorochrome-coupled immune complexes. Current activation was linear throughout the voltage range and was accompanied by a depolarizing shift in the zero current potential. Fig. 2 shows examples of simultaneous current and microfluorimetry recordings from three macrophages at different stages of development in culture. The membrane potential was held at −60 mV and voltage ramps from −100 to 100 mV, 300 ms in duration were repetitively applied every 3 s throughout the experiment. Exposure of the cells to DCFH-ICs induced an increase in fluorescence, which represented an increase in free radical production and was associated with the generation of a current with a reversal potential of −0.9 ± 0.8 mV (n = 9). The lag time preceding the onset of the current response appeared to be correlated with the length of time cells were maintained in culture. Older cells displayed an increase in the time required to observe both free radical release as well as current activation and membrane depolarization, data which is summarized in Table 1. In the absence of stimulus, cells exhibited stable whole-cell currents and no change in fluorescence.Figure 2:Response time for superoxide release as well as membrane depolarization following phagocytosis of DCFH-IC becomes slower the longer cells are maintained in culture. Coupled voltage-clamp and microfluorimetry experiments showing simultaneous changes in fluorescence, membrane potential, and membrane current in three representative cells following exposure to 15 μg/ml DCFH-IC. After uptake of immune complexes, reactive oxygen products are generated, as indicated by changes in fluorescence (top panel in A-C). The accumulation of intracellular oxidants was associated with the activation of a non-selective current and with an accompanying membrane potential depolarization. The fluorescent response was normalized to the peak response for each for each cell. Variability in cell size and differences in the rate of particle uptake precluded comparative analysis of free radial release among cells examined. Membrane currents measured in response to 300 ms voltage ramps from −100 to 100 mV every 3 s from a holding potential of −60 mV are seen in the second panel in A-C. Illustrated membrane currents were obtained from voltage ramps at six different membrane potentials between 100 and −100 mV and shown at 40-mV intervals. Membrane potential was determined as the zero current potential for each of the voltage ramps over the duration of the experiment as shown in the third panel from each of the representative cells. In some cells, a transient hyperpolarization was seen prior to depolarization. The time before fluorescent response and the lag time between initial increase in fluorescence and membrane depolarization was dependent on the age of the cell in culture.

Addition of 50 μM DPI to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated intact neutrophils has been shown to cause marked inhibition of superoxide generation (Cross and Jones, 1986). Similar results have also been obtained in murine peritoneal macrophages (Hancock and Jones, 1987; Stuehr et al., 1991). Digital fluorescent imaging experiments were carried out on HMDMs in the presence and absence of DPI. Cells preincubated with 5 μM DPI prior to the addition of DCFH-IC failed to give rise to an increase in fluorescence as compared to control cells, as seen in Fig. 3. Similarly, we were unable to observe current activation in cells pre-treated with DPI (5 μM) 10 min prior to exposure to DCFH-IC (Fig. 4). Peak current amplitude at maximal depolarizations of 100 mV in the presence and absence of DPI is summarized in Table 2.Figure 4:Current activation is dependent upon NADPH oxidase activity. HMDMs preincubated in DPI, a specific inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, do not exhibit current activation in response to DCFH-IC. Patch-clamp experiments were carried out at 30°C in bath solutions containing 140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 2 mM Ca2+, 2 mM Mg2+, and 10 mM HEPES, with pipette solutions containing 140 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM Ca2+, and 2 mM Mg2+.

A representative fluorescent response for a cytochalasin-treated cell is compared to that obtained to a control cell in Fig. 5. We were unable to observe an increase in fluorescence in response to DCFH-IC in a total of six cells following pretreatment with cytochalasin, indicating that oxidation of the dye was occurring intracellularly. A similar inhibition of the fluorescent response in cells pretreated with cytochalasin B was observed in the flow cytometric studies of Ryan et al.(1990). In order to determine whether the reactive oxygen species generated during the phagocytic response were directly responsible for current generation, we investigated the effect of O2− on HMDMs in the absence of phagocytosis. Exposure of cells to O2− generated in the presence of xanthine and xanthine oxidase gave rise to changes in current and shifts in zero current potential resembling those following phagocytosis of DCFH-ICs as seen in Fig. 6. This result indicates that the presence of oxygen metabolites alone is sufficient to induce current activation. Currents induced under either condition were completely inhibited in the presence of 1 mM La3+ indicating that the non-selective currents were not simply the result of instabilities in the electrophysiological recording or free radical-induced membrane breakdown. The ionic selectivity of the free radical-induced current was determined in experiments in which Na+ and Cl− were the major permeant species and the cells stimulated in the presence of DCFH-ICs. The cation to anion selectivity was determined from current reversal potentials obtained when 100 mM of the NaCl in the intracellular solution was substituted with NMDG-glutamate. Under these conditions, the cation to anion permeability ratio (Pcaption/Panion) was calculated to be 1.0. This value may reflect the fact that 1) the conductance is not selective for cations over anions, i.e. the Na+/Cl− permeability ratio is low, or 2) the conductance is partially permeant to glutamate, i.e. the Cl−/glutamate permeability ratio is low, or 3) there are a number of conductances which are simultaneously activated during the response to free radical release. The relative permeability of the DCFH-IC activated conductance to several monovalent cations was determined in experiments in which the Na+ in the bath solution was replaced with chloride salts of either K+, Cs+, Li+, or NMDG. The ionic selectivity among cations was determined from shifts in the reversal potential as determined in three cells, each of which was exposed sequentially to the five cations and is summarized in Table 3. The relative cation permeability (Pcaption/PNa) of the DCFH-IC-induced current as determined in three cells was K+ (1.37) > Cs+ (1.28) > Na+ = Li+ (1.00) > NMDG+ (0.69) which corresponds to the Eisenman sequence IV indicating that permeation is likely to be weakly dominated by the dehydration energy of the permeating species and that with the exception of NMDG, the DCFH-IC-activated conductance showed poor selectivity among the monovalent cations examined. While our results clearly demonstrate that monovalent cations contribute to the free radical-induced current, these experiments did not determine whether current flow was through single or multiple channel types.Table III Open table in a new tab The sensitivity of the DCFH-IC activated current to external Ca2+ was examined in experiments conducted in Ca2+-free bath solutions buffered with 1 mM EGTA. In these experiments the pipette solution contained 10 mM BAPTA without additional Ca2+, with one exception where the standard Ca2+ buffer was used. These experiments indicated that DCFH-IC-induced current activation was significantly attenuated under Ca2+-free conditions. Peak current at 100 mV in response to DCFH-IC in Ca2+-free solutions was 248 ± 52 pA (n = 3) as compared to 4804 ± 1240 pA (n = 3) obtained in Ca2+-containing solutions. The mean change in current after addition of DCFH-IC was −183 ± 33 pA in Ca2+-free solutions and 4475 ± 1428 pA in Ca2+ containing solutions (p < 0.08). Normalized to capacitance, this corresponds to a decrease of 1.7 pA/pF in Ca2+-free solutions and an increase of 50.8 pA/pF in Ca2+-containing solutions. Capacitance values for these cells were estimated using data in which the capacitance for HMDMs relative to age in culture was previously determined (Nelson, 1990). The decrease in current amplitude under Ca2+-free conditions could reflect the fact that the free radical sensitive-channels are Ca2+ activated or alternatively that the activity of NADPH-oxidase is Ca2+-dependent. To differentiate between the two possibilities, fluorescence imaging experiments were carried out on cells in the presence and absence of external Ca2+. We were unable to observe a significant difference in the fluorescence response to DCFH-IC as a function of the external Ca2+ concentration. The average increase in fluorescence intensity in Ca2+-containing solutions was 176.8 ± 20% (n = 5) as compared to an increase of 201.4 ± 49.8% observed in nominally Ca2+-free solutions. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the conductance increase and not the oxidase activity is Ca2+ sensitive. Data supporting a link between changes in membrane potential and cellular oxidative metabolism comes from population studies showing that conditions which inhibit membrane depolarization also prevent generation of respiratory burst activity (Simchowitz and Spilberg, 1979). The importance of depolarization in the generation of a respiratory burst response has also been emphasized in studies involving neutrophils from chronic granulomatous disease patients. These cells lack the ability to produce O2−, and they additionally fail to undergo significant depolarization upon surface stimulation (Seligmann and Gallin, 1980; Whitin et al., 1980). Furthermore, studies on lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages (Kitagawa and Johnston, 1985) revealed that these cells concomitantly develop an increased capacity for depolarization and respiratory burst responsivity, suggesting that cell depolarization does not occur artifactually as a result of membrane perturbation, but may be an important mechanism of signal transduction. Superoxide generation is not limited to phagocytes and bactericidal activity. The consequences of free radical generation might be generalized and expected to regulate variety of cellular functions. Transformed as well as normal human B lymphocytes efficiently release O2− when stimulated by surface immunoglobulin cross-linking or phorbol esters (Dorseuil et al., 1992; Maly et al., 1988; Volkman et al., 1984). Moreover, it has been suggested that reactive oxygen intermediates may regulate genes involved in inflammatory and immune responses serving as signaling molecules in T lymphocytes controlling activation of the transcription factor NFκB (Schreck et al., 1991). Whitin et al.(1980) have reported that phorbol ester-stimulated granulocytes undergo membrane depolarization under anaerobic conditions where no O2− is produced, suggesting that membrane potential and superoxide production are not coupled. Phorbol esters known to activate protein kinase C, as well as purified protein kinase C have been shown to regulate the activation of both anion and cation channels (Berger et al., 1993; Charpentier et al., 1993; Fournier et al., 1993; Li et al., 1993; Oike et al., 1993; Tabcharani et al., 1991). Therefore, in phorbol ester-stimulated cells, it is not unreasonable to expect that changes in membrane potential might be observed as a consequence of protein kinase C-mediated ion channel phosphorylation independent of O2− generation. The electrophysiological response of the cells undergoing phagocytosis in our studies might well be different from the response in cells stimulated with phorbol esters. The time course of phorbol ester-induced depolarization has been shown to be a sensitive function of the fluorescent probe used to measure membrane potential in flow cytometric studies of phorbol ester-stimulated neutrophils (Seligmann and Gallin, 1983). Seligmann and Gallin(1983) were able to demonstrate that the fluorescence of the carbocyanine dye di-S-C3(5) used as the membrane potential probe is destroyed by reactive oxygen products produced by neutrophils following stimulation, giving rise to an apparent insensitivity of the cellular response to the effects of scavengers or inhibitors of various reactive oxygen species. This fact coupled with the toxicity of the carbocyanine dyes at high concentrations (Seligmann and Gallin, 1983) would lead to the erroneous conclusion in phorbol ester-stimulated cells monitored with carbocyanine dyes that membrane potential and O2− are not coupled. In our studies, we have determined membrane potential directly, thereby circumventing the problems encountered with dye toxicity and sensitivity to free radical destruction. The ability of mononuclear phagocytes to respond to respiratory burst activators is also related to the stage of cellular differentiation. Resident tissue macrophages produce only low levels of superoxide anion (Biggar et al., 1976; DeChatelet et al., 1975). Monocytes allowed to differentiate in culture resemble tissue macrophages as evidenced by a progressive loss in respiratory burst activity (Musson et al., 1982; Seim, 1982). Our observation that the time course of current activation following the generation of free radicals in HMDMs is dependent upon age in culture may be the consequence of the reduction in the O2− generating capacity of the cells with differentiation and suggests that a critical concentration of free radical is needed to induce an electrophysiological response. The large lag time between oxidant production and current change observed in the older cells may alternatively be due to 1) a decrease in the oxidant sensitivity of the ionic channel(s) generating the current, 2) a decrease in the expression of the oxidant sensitive channel(s) or 3) a decrease in the expression and/or oxidant sensitivity of a regulatory protein which controls channel opening. This study demonstrates that oxygen metabolites generated during the phagocytic response, as well as exogenous O2−, activate a non-selective membrane current which induces membrane depolarization and is inhibitable by La3+. Data from this investigation provide evidence that membrane depolarization does not signal activation of the superoxide generating system but rather is a consequence of its activation. It has been generally observed that following Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis there is a general depression of macrophage respiratory burst capacity as well as tumoricidal activity (Commins et al., 1990; Loegering and Schwacha, 1991; Schwacha et al., 1993). Thus, membrane depolarization which accompanies the initial phagocytic event may be one of a number of signals which down-regulate the granulocyte response to subsequent stimuli. We thank Drs. E. R. Simons and V. Bindokas for many helpful discussions during this investigation."

https://openalex.org/W2066331982,"The Escherichia coli aidB gene is part of the adaptive response to DNA methylation damage. Genes belonging to the adaptive response are positively regulated by the ada gene; the Ada protein acts as a transcriptional activator when methylated in one of its cysteine residues at position 69. Through DNaseI protection assays, we show that methylated Ada (meAda) is able to bind a DNA sequence between 40 and 60 base pairs upstream of the aidB transcriptional startpoint. Binding of meAda is necessary to activate transcription of the adaptive response genes; accordingly, in vitro transcription of aidB is dependent on the presence of meAda. Unmethylated Ada protein shows no protection against DNaseI digestion in the aidB promoter region nor does it promote aidBin vitro transcription. The aidB Ada-binding site shows only weak homology to the proposed consensus sequences for Ada-binding sites in E. coli (AAANNAA and AAAGCGCA) but shares a higher degree of similarity with the Ada-binding regions from other bacterial species, such as Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis. Based on the comparison of five different Ada-dependent promoter regions, we suggest that a possible recognition sequence for meAda might be AATnnnnnnGCAA. Higher concentrations of Ada are required for the binding of aidB than for the ada promoter, suggesting lower affinity of the protein for the aidB Ada-binding site. Common features in the Ada-binding regions of ada and aidB are a high A/T content, the presence of an inverted repeat structure, and their position relative to the transcriptional start site.

We propose that these elements, in addition to the proposed recognition sequence, are important for binding of the Ada protein. In Escherichia coli, the adaptive response to DNA methylation damage is activated by sublethal concentrations of methylating agents such as methyl methanesulfonate or N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) 1The abbreviations used are: MNNGN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidinebpbase pair(s)meAdamethylated Ada. (1Jeggo P. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Samson L. Cairns J. Nature. 1977; 267: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Upon activation, cells are protected from the toxic and mutagenic effects of these agents. The Ada protein is the key enzyme of the adaptive response; this protein is a methyltransferase able to remove methyl groups from damaged DNA, transferring them to two of its own cysteine residues. Ada protein methylated at Cys-69 (meAda) can bind to specific DNA sequences in the promoter region of several genes; binding of meAda makes the promoters accessible to RNA polymerase and therefore activates their transcription(3Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Teo I. Sedgwick B. Kilpatrick M.W. McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T. Cell. 1986; 45: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Moreover, a direct protein-protein interaction takes place, since RNA polymerase mutants resulting from deletions in the C-terminal domain of the α subunit are unable to support transcription from the ada promoter, even when meAda is present(5Sakumi K. Igarashi K. Sekiguchi M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2455-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unmethylated Ada protein, on the contrary, seems to be involved in negative regulation of the ada promoter(6Saget B. Walker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Methylated Ada activates transcription of its own gene, ada, and of at least two other genes, alkA and aidB. The ada promoter is also responsible for the transcription of another gene, alkB, whose function is unknown(7Kataoka H. Yamamoto Y. Sekiguchi M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1301-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The product of the alkA gene is a glycosylase that recognizes and excises methylated DNA bases(8Nakabeppu Y. Miyata T. Kondo H. Iwanaga S. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13730-13736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aidB gene encodes a protein homologous to mammalian isovaleryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase. Overexpression of the AidB protein is able to counteract MNNG-mediated mutagenesis in vivo(9Landini P. Hajec L.I. Volkert M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6583-6589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this effect seems to be specific for MNNG. 2M. R. Volkert, unpublished data. It seems possible that the AidB protein is involved in a detoxification pathway for MNNG, although it is still unclear if this function is related to its isovaleryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase activity. N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine base pair(s) methylated Ada. For both the ada/alkB and the alkA promoters, the Ada-binding site has been determined by DNaseI protection experiments; two short sequences common to both ada and alkA promoter regions (AAANNAA and AAAGCGCA) have been proposed as the Ada-binding sequence (Ada box) by different papers ((10Akimaru H. Sakumi K. Yoshikai T. Anai M. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and (11Nakamura T. Tokumoto Y. Sakumi K. Koike G. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), respectively). Mutations in the AAAGCGCA sequence have been shown to abolish transcriptional activation of the ada gene by meAda(11Nakamura T. Tokumoto Y. Sakumi K. Koike G. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although the same is true for mutations outside of this proposed consensus sequence(11Nakamura T. Tokumoto Y. Sakumi K. Koike G.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Counterparts of the ada genes have been found in many other bacteria, as well as in eukaryotic and mammalian cells(13Morohoshi F. Hayashi K. Munakata N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5473-5480Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Sklar R. Strauss B. Nature. 1981; 289: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis, Ada-binding sites have been identified and sequenced(15Hakura A. Morimoto K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3663-3672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Morohoshi F. Hayashi K. Munakata N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6010-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); in both of these bacterial species, no precise consensus sequence has been assigned. However, it has been shown that E. coli Ada protein is able to activate transcription from the S. typhimurium ada gene(15Hakura A. Morimoto K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3663-3672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aidB gene is ada regulated(17Volkert M.R. Nguyen D.C. Beard K.C. Genetics. 1986; 112: 11-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but unlike other adaptive response genes, aidB can also be induced by oxygen-limiting conditions, or by the addition of sodium acetate to the growth medium, at a final pH of 6.0-6.5(18Volkert M.R. Hajec L.I. Nguyen D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1196-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Smirnova G.V. Oktyabrsky O.N. Moshonkina E.V. Zakirova N.V. Mutat. Res. 1994; 314: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This second mechanism of induction is ada independent and requires a functional rpoS gene. rpoS encodes σs, an alternative σ factor for RNA polymerase that is required for expression of stationary phase-specific genes(20Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In this report, we will consider only the mechanism of the ada-dependent activation of aidB. It has already been shown that methylated Ada protein is able to bind to the aidB promoter region in vitro(9Landini P. Hajec L.I. Volkert M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6583-6589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although aidB lacks both the AAANNAA and the AAAGCGCA sequences common to ada and alkA. This suggests that both of these sequences might be non-essential features of the Ada-binding site. In this paper, we describe the aidB Ada-binding site and discuss its importance as a general model for gene regulation by the Ada protein. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]dCTP, and [α-32P]CTP were from Amersham Corp. E. coli RNA polymerase and RNase-free DNaseI were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. For gel retardation assays, DNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dATP by end-filling with DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). The following fragments were used: for ada, a 176-bp HindIII-EcoRI fragment from plasmid pYN3066(3Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); for aidB, a 106-bp BamHI-StyI fragment from pMV120 ((9Landini P. Hajec L.I. Volkert M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6583-6589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Fig. 1). For DNaseI protection assays, a 246-bp BamHI-MluI aidB fragment from plasmid pMV120 was labeled with [α-32P]dATP at the BamHI site (template strand); for the coding strand, a BamHI-BstXI fragment (Fig. 1) was subcloned into the BamHI-MluI sites of pSport1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) using a BstXI-MluI linker oligonucleotide (Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA) and producing plasmid pMV442. The EcoRI-MluI fragment from pMV442 (165 bp) was labeled at the MluI site with [α-32P]dCTP by the Klenow end-filling reaction. For in vitro transcription, the HindIII-EcoRI fragment from ada, the BamHI-MluI fragment from aidB, and the lacUV5 promoter (a 205-bp EcoRI fragment from plasmid pYN3072(3Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)) were used. All DNA fragments were isolated by electrophoresis and purified from agarose using a Geneclean kit (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA). Methylation of the Ada protein was produced by incubating the protein (120 pmol) with 1 μg of methylated calf thymus DNA for 15 min at 37°C in 20 μl of 70 mM Na-Hepes, pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. For unmethylated Ada, the protein was incubated in the same conditions with 1 μg of unmethylated DNA. 10,000 cpm of labeled DNA, corresponding to approximately 10 fmol, were used in each reaction. The binding reaction was performed at 22°C for 45 min in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 20 μl. The samples were loaded on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel and run in 0.25 × TBE at 12 V/cm. Samples were treated as described for the gel retardation assay. After 45 min at 22°C, 6 mM CaCl2 and 200 ng of DNaseI were added, and samples were incubated for 30 s at 22°C. DNaseI digestion was stopped with an equal volume (25 μl) of DNaseI stop solution (600 mM NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 30 μg/ml of salmon sperm DNA), and samples were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in loading buffer. Samples were heated for 3 min at 100°C and loaded onto a denaturing polyacrylamide/urea gel. 0.5 pmol of the promoter regions from lac, ada, and aidB were pre-incubated as described for the gel retardation experiment, with the addition of 4 pmol of RNA polymerase. Transcription reactions were started by the addition of 6 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.2 mM UTP, 0.2 mM GTP, 120 μg/ml heparin, and 1 μCi of [α-32P]CTP. Incubation was for 6 min at 30°C. After addition of 1000-fold unlabeled CTP, the reaction was continued for 5 min and blocked with an equal volume of DNaseI stop solution (see above). Samples were processed as described for DNaseI protection experiments and analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel. To identify the Ada-binding site in the aidB promoter region, DNaseI protection experiments were performed. Results are shown in Fig. 2A for the coding strand and in Fig. 2B for the template strand. For the coding strand, clear protection by 12 pmol of meAda can be observed between nucleotides −62 to −38 relative to the transcriptional start site. This area is marked by the solidline in Fig. 2A. Two DNaseI-hypersensitive sites, at positions −35 and −28, could also be detected. The region between these two hypersensitive sites also shows a weak protection by meAda. Although the borders of the protected region appear to be less clear on the template strand, the pattern emerging from DNaseI protection experiments is very similar; the bands corresponding to positions −62 to −38 are protected by meAda (marked by a solidline in Fig. 2B). Two hypersensitive sites are also present at nucleotides −68 and −75 from the transcription start. It is noteworthy that the position of the hypersensitive sites is downstream of the protected region in the coding strand and upstream of it in the template strand. This might suggest that binding of meAda induces a symmetrical distortion of the DNA helix in the bordering regions. No DNaseI-protected or -hypersensitive site was detectable with 12 pmol of unmethylated Ada in either of the two strands (Fig. 2, A and B). Fig. 3 compares the aidB Ada-binding site to those from the E. coli ada and alkA genes(3Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6297-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), from the S. typhimurium ada gene(15Hakura A. Morimoto K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3663-3672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and from the B. subtilis alkA gene(16Morohoshi F. Hayashi K. Munakata N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6010-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Ada-binding site from aidB displays a higher similarity with the Ada boxes from the B. subtilis alkA gene (14 identical nucleotides out of 18, 78% identity) and for the S. typhimurium ada gene (67% identity) than for both the ada and alkA genes from E. coli (56% identity). Since aidB does not share a very high homology with the Ada-binding site from the ada promoter, it was possible that the methylated Ada protein could display a different affinity for the two sites. To answer this question, we performed a gel retardation assay with both the ada and the aidB Ada-binding regions in the presence of different concentrations of unmethylated and methylated Ada protein. 100% retardation is obtained at a concentration of meAda as low as 0.3 pmol for ada (Fig. 4B), while it takes an approximately 10-fold higher concentration for aidB (Fig. 4A). Binding was also observed with unmethylated Ada, although 100% retardation was not obtained for aidB at the concentrations tested and was obtained for ada only at 10 pmol. At high concentrations of meAda, new bands with a slower electrophoretic mobility began to appear, particularly for the ada promoter. Although we cannot rule out that more than one molecule of meAda might be able to bind specifically at the same time, it seems likely that the slower bands result from nonspecific interaction between DNA and meAda and/or residual unmethylated protein. In the reaction conditions described by Teo et al.(4Teo I. Sedgwick B. Kilpatrick M.W. McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T. Cell. 1986; 45: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), in which meAda is able to stimulate transcription from the ada promoter, we could not detect any transcription from the aidB promoter region. However, in a cell-free transcription/translation system, meAda was required for transcription of the aidB gene from the supercoiled plasmid pMV426(9Landini P. Hajec L.I. Volkert M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6583-6589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that binding of meAda is necessary for aidB transcription. Fig. 5 shows in vitro transcription assays with purified RNA polymerase performed using the reaction buffer from the footprint experiments instead of the transcription buffer previously used(4Teo I. Sedgwick B. Kilpatrick M.W. McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T. Cell. 1986; 45: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In these conditions, transcription from the aidB promoter produces an mRNA of approximately 120 nucleotides in size, determined using a known DNA sequencing ladder as a molecular weight marker (Fig. 5B, lanes2-4). This value is in good agreement with the position of the transcriptional start sites identified in vivo ((9Landini P. Hajec L.I. Volkert M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6583-6589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Fig. 1). This transcript was the only one to be affected by the presence of meAda (Fig. 5B, lane4). It is likely that the other transcripts originate from nonspecific transcription from either promoter-like elements or the ends of the DNA fragment. Fig. 5A shows transcription from the ada promoter using the same experimental conditions; the size of the transcripts (92-98 nucleotides) and the presence of multiple start sites are in agreement with the results of Teo et al.(4Teo I. Sedgwick B. Kilpatrick M.W. McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T. Cell. 1986; 45: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The aidB gene is ada regulated in vivo(17Volkert M.R. Nguyen D.C. Beard K.C. Genetics. 1986; 112: 11-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Ada protein, in its methylated form (meAda), is able to interact with the aidB promoter region and stimulate its transcription(9Landini P. Hajec L.I. Volkert M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6583-6589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither of the two consensus sequences so far proposed for Ada-binding sites (10Akimaru H. Sakumi K. Yoshikai T. Anai M. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Nakamura T. Tokumoto Y. Sakumi K. Koike G. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) has been found in aidB. With DNaseI protection experiments, it has been possible to identify the specific binding site for meAda; this area spans approximately 24 nucleotides, slightly more than the number of nucleotides protected in both the ada and the alkA promoter regions(4Teo I. Sedgwick B. Kilpatrick M.W. McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T. Cell. 1986; 45: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Ada-binding sites are centered at different positions relative to the promoter elements and the transcriptional start site in ada and alkA, but they are always located in the proximity of the −35 region; in the ada gene, the protein binds immediately upstream, protecting the residues from −40 to −60, while in alkA the binding site overlaps the −35 region, spanning from −32 to −52(4Teo I. Sedgwick B. Kilpatrick M.W. McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T. Cell. 1986; 45: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Sakumi K. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The location of the Ada-binding site of aidB is the same as that of ada; meAda protects from DNaseI digestion an area extending from −38 to −62. The location of the Ada-binding site in aidB may provide information on the −35 and −10 promoter elements and define the areas to target in future site-specific mutagenesis analysis. The aidB promoter, like many other positively controlled promoters, lacks −10 and −35 consensus sequences; based on the position of the transcriptional start site, the most likely candidate for a −10 sequence is CATACT (Fig. 1). This hexamer maintains the sixth (T) and the second (A) nucleotide residues that are strongly conserved in positively controlled promoters (22Raibaud M. Schwartz R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 173-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is similar to CAGCCT, which is the −10 sequence for the ada promoter (11Nakamura T. Tokumoto Y. Sakumi K. Koike G. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Assuming that CATACT is the −10 for aidB, a possible −35 box might be CTGTCA, which is located 18 base pairs upstream and is similar to TTGACA, the consensus sequence for the −35 region. In Fig. 3, we have compared the Ada-binding site of aidB with the E. coli ada and alkA genes, as well as to the ada gene from S. typhimurium(15Hakura A. Morimoto K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3663-3672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the alkA gene from B. subtilis(16Morohoshi F. Hayashi K. Munakata N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6010-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that when the ada gene from S. typhimurium is cloned into E. coli, it functions as part of the adaptive response, i.e. its Ada-binding site is recognized by the E. coli methylated Ada protein(15Hakura A. Morimoto K. Sofuni T. Nohmi T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3663-3672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Common elements among these binding sites are the presence of an AGCAA-like sequence (AGCAA in aidB and in alkA from both E. coli and B. subtilis, ACGCAA in ada from S. typhimurium, and AGCGCAA in the ada gene from E. coli) preceded by an A/T-rich region. Another common sequence is a short AAT that is always present five nucleotides upstream of the AGCAA-like element. These observations suggest that a possible recognition sequence for meAda might be AATnnnnnnGCAA. However, it is likely that elements other than the simple nucleotide sequence play a role in the recognition of the binding site by meAda. The A/T-rich sequence is likely to determine local DNA structural modification such as bending(23Perez-Martin J. Rojo F. De Lorenzo V. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 268-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another common feature is the location of the Ada-binding site, immediately upstream of the −35 box. This position is important for protein-protein interaction between meAda and RNA polymerase, interaction known to be necessary for Ada-mediated transcriptional activation(5Sakumi K. Igarashi K. Sekiguchi M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2455-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the aidB and ada genes from E. coli, the AGCAA (aidB) and the AGCGCAA (ada) sequences are at the center of an imperfect palindrome (Fig. 1 and (4Teo I. Sedgwick B. Kilpatrick M.W. McCarthy T.V. Lindahl T. Cell. 1986; 45: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)); although this structure might be involved in the regulation of the two genes, it does not appear to be a general feature for Ada-binding sites. The affinity of meAda for its binding site in ada is higher than for aidB, as determined using gel retardation assays. Fig. 4 shows that a 100% bandshift is observed at a concentration of 0.3 pmol of meAda for the ada promoter, while the same effect is obtained at concentrations of meAda at least 10-fold higher for the aidB regulatory region. This suggests that additional determinants, such as local modification of DNA structure, may be necessary for optimal interaction between meAda and its binding site. This view is supported by the fact that, in the ada promoter, mutations affecting local DNA bending have been shown to abolish transcriptional activation by meAda (12Bertrand-Burgraff E. Dunard J. Fuchs R.P.P. Lefevre J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), although they fall outside any consensus sequence so far proposed for the Ada-binding site. The lower affinity of meAda for aidB is likely to play a role in the lower transcriptional levels displayed by aidB both in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro experiments, the levels of induced transcription for aidB are much lower than for the ada promoter (Fig. 5). In experiments performed in vivo using aidB::lacZ chromosomal fusions, aidB transcription requires higher concentrations of methylating agents for induction compared with the ada or the alkA promoters(24Volkert M.R. Gately F.H. Hajec L.I. Mutat. Res. 1989; 217: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). aidB induction, however, is neither indirect nor accidental, since aidB has been shown to be effective in counteracting MNNG-mediated mutagenesis(9Landini P. Hajec L.I. Volkert M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6583-6589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that induction of adaptive response genes may take place at different levels of methylation damage, and this “fine tuning” may be determined by different affinities of meAda for different Ada-binding sites. According to this hypothesis, aidB might be regarded as an “emergency gene,” activated when ada and alkA induction are no longer enough to counteract high levels of methylation damage. We thank Graham Walker, Bradford Saget, and Robert Pohlman for the gift of purified Ada protein and for useful discussion and Laurel Hajec for critical reading of the manuscript."

A major unanswered question is whether the regulation of proliferation and of differentiated gene expression by a given hematopoietin receptor is mediated by identical or distinct signal-transducing mechanisms. The intracellular initiation of signal transduction by ligand-occupied hematopoietin receptors involves an immediate phosphorylation of the receptor cytoplasmic domain concomitant with the activation of receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases. These protein tyrosine kinases, depending upon the cell type, include members of the Janus kinase family (JAK/Tyk) (28Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

The change in the phosphorylation state of the receptor promotes the binding of the STAT (signal transducer and activation of transcription) proteins to the receptor(28Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M.

One of the consequences of protein tyrosine kinase action is the phosphorylation of the receptor-recruited STAT protein(s) that lead to the STAT protein dimerization and activation of DNA binding activity (34Shuai K.

To assess the complexity of intracellular signaling pathways which are activated by various hematopoietin receptor types and which control expression of differentiated genes, we developed tissue culture systems in which receptor-specific gene regulatory functions were reconstituted(44Baumann H.

By applying this experimental approach, we have established a sensitive assay system for defining common signaling mechanisms utilized by seemingly related receptor structures. In this study, we used rat and human hepatoma, L-, and COS cells for probing the interaction of IL-2R and representative members of the other hematopoietin receptor groups with the intracellular signal transduction machinery. Receptor functions were determined in rat hepatoma H-35 cells (subclonal line of clone T-7-18; (46Baumann H. Prowse K.R. Marinkovic S. Won K.-A. Jahreis G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

After a 16-h recovery period, the transfected cell culture was subdivided into a 6-well cluster plate, and, 24 h later, the subcultures were treated with cytokines for 24 h.

For analyzing receptor expression and SIF activation, L- and COS-1 cells in 15-cm diameter culture dishes were transfected with 30 μg of receptor expression vector in 3 ml. The transfected cultures were subdivided and, after a 24-h recovery, maintained for an additional 16 h in serum-free medium. Cytokine treatments were then carried out for 15 min (except where indicated). Whole cell, cytosolic, and nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure of Sadowski et al.(35Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The double-stranded SIEm67 oligonucleotide was labeled by fill-in reaction using Klenow fragment of polymerase α and [32P]dCTP. Whole cell extracts (5 μl) or nuclear proteins (10 μg) were preincubated in a 20-μl reaction volume with 5 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 15 min on ice followed by the addition of labeled probe (20,000 cpm), and the binding reaction continued for 15 min at room temperature. Ten μl of the reaction mixture were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate EDTA buffer. In all GMSA experiments, a binding reaction with nuclear extracts from H-35 cells treated for 15 min with IL-6 was included as an internal standard. The radioactive pattern was visualized by autoradiography. RNA was extracted from cells 40-48 h after transfection (67Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J.

After 20 min on ice, the extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 25,000 × g. The supernatants were pretreated with 20 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h and then reacted for 16 h with 5 μl of rabbit anti-human G-CSFR serum(33Corey S.J.

The EF-C binding site was previously shown to be an important functional component of each enhancer region. EF-C is a ubiquitous binding activity that interacts with an inverted repeat sequence in the HBV and Py enhancer regions. Although the EF-C binding site is required for optimal enhancer function, the EF-C site does not possess intrinsic enhancer activity when assayed in the absence of flanking elements. With both the HBV and Py enhancer regions, EF-C stimulates the activity of adjacent enhancer elements in a synergistic manner. EF-C corresponds to RFX-1, a protein that binds to a conserved and functionally important site in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen promoter regions. Interestingly, the RFX-1 binding site in MHC class II promoters only contains an EF-C half-site, maintaining one arm of the inverted repeat in an EF-C binding site. We have investigated the binding of purified EF-C and RFX-1 to sites in the Py and HBV enhancer regions that carry mutations that either disrupt one arm of the EF-C inverted repeat, or alter the spacing between the repeats. Our results show that the interaction of EF-C and RFX-1 with an intact inverted repeat is required for functional activity of these viral enhancer regions. Chemical footprinting and modification interference assays show that the interaction of EF-C and RFX-1 with the DRA MHC class II promoter truly represents half-site interaction, and that this binding is unstable. In contrast, the binding of EF-C and RFX-1 to the viral inverted repeats is stable. These results suggest that an additional activity may be required to stabilize EF-C/RFX-1 interaction with the MHC class II promoter, and that viral enhancer regions have evolved high affinity binding sites to sequester dimeric EF-C/RFX-1.

Much of what is known about the organization of eukaryotic enhancer regions comes from systematic studies of the SV40 enhancer, where it was observed that individual cis-acting elements often do not have intrinsic enhancer function but rather function in conjunction with one or more adjacent cis-acting sequences (1Ondek B.

The individual cis-acting elements have been referred to as enhansons, and they constitute the binding sites for specific trans-acting proteins. Different types of enhansons have been described for the SV40 enhancer including: 1) enhansons that have intrinsic enhancer activity, 2) enhansons that function when dimerized or multimerized, and 3) enhansons that function in combination with other enhanson elements.

We and others have shown that EF-C corresponds to two seemingly unrelated activities that have been described. The first is MDBP, a protein that binds to certain DNA sites only when methylated at CpG dinucleotide base pairs(8Huang L.H. Wang R. Gaga-Sosa M.A. Shenoy S. Ehrlich M. Nature. 1984; 308: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Khan R. Zhang X.Y. Supakar P.C. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8611-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). EF-C and MDBP share indistinguishable binding properties to a number of different binding sites, including the binding to certain sites only when methylated at CpG base pairs (11Garcia A.D. Ostapchuk P. Hearing P. Virology. 1991; 182: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Recently, the identification that EF-C and MDBP correspond to an additional activity, RFX-1, was described(12Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Emery P. David E. Hearing P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6375-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Zhang X.Y. Ferrat N.J. Asiedu C.K. Samac S. Peterlin B.M. Ehrlich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6810-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RFX-1 is a member of a family of related transcription factors that form homo- and heterodimers, and that bind to the conserved and functionally important X box in MHC class II antigen promoter regions(14Reith W. Ucla C. Barras E. Gaud A. Durand B. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Mach B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1230-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Experiments using RFX-1 antisense RNA have shown that RFX-1 is a functional regulator of MHC class II gene expression in vivo(15Reith W. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Silacci P. Berte C. Barras E. Fey S. Mach B. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1528-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, it is clear from the analysis of cell lines from patients with combined immunodeficiency syndrome that other RFX-1-related activities, as well as other activities that are distinguishable from RFX-1, are important for MHC class II gene expression(14Reith W. Ucla C. Barras E. Gaud A. Durand B. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Mach B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1230-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Herrero-Sanchez C. Reith W. Silacci P.

Biol. 1992; 12: 2383-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus a complicated picture of different transcriptional regulators that bind to the MHC class II promoter X box has emerged. How these activators regulate basal and induced expression of MHC class II gene expression has not been determined. In this report, we have investigated the binding of EF-C purified from HeLa cell extracts and RFX-1 produced in vitro to binding sites in the HBV and Py enhancer regions that carry mutations that either disrupt one arm of the EF-C inverted repeat, or alter the spacing between the repeats. These mutations result in the generation of EF-C half-sites which mimic the RFX-1 binding site in the MHC class II promoter. Our results show that the interaction of EF-C with an intact inverted repeat is required for functional activity of viral enhancer regions, and that the interaction of EF-C and RFX-1 with the DRA MHC class II promoter truly represents half-site interaction. The binding of EF-C and RFX-1 to an EF-C half-site is unstable, while binding to the inverted repeats present in viral enhancer regions is stable. These results suggest that an additional activity may be required to stabilize RFX-1 interaction with the MHC class II promoter, and that viral enhancer regions have evolved high affinity binding sites for dimeric EF-C/RFX-1. Insertion mutations in the HBV enhancer I DNA fragment (nt 1117-1247, HBV subtype ayw; Fig. 1) between the arms of the EF-C site inverted repeat were previously described(4Ostapchuk P. Scheirle G. Hearing P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2787-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the EF-C binding site in the Py enhancer region were generated by site-directed oligonucleotide mutagenesis as described by Kunkel(18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar), in vector Py-NEO+Py5104-5177, described previously(5Bolwig G.M. Hearing P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1884-1892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These recombinant plasmids were used as a source of probe DNAs. HBV enhancer region fragments were excised by EcoRI and BamHI digestion; Py enhancer region fragments were excised by EcoRI and HindIII digestion. The released enhancer region DNA fragments were gel-purified and quantitated by ethidium bromide staining on a polyacrylamide gel in comparison to known quantities of a standard DNA marker. Typically, ~40 ng of a DNA fragment was used to prepare a 32P-labeled probe by incorporating [α-32P]dATP into the ends of the purified DNAs using Klenow DNA polymerase; specific activities were ~20,000 cpm/fmol. In vivo Py transient DNA replication assays were performed as described(5Bolwig G.M. Hearing P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1884-1892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Py enhancer segments (Py nt 5104-5177; Fig. 1A) containing the different EF-C site point mutations were introduced upstream of the SV40 early promoter (enhancer-less vector) in vector pOP-CAT and CAT expression levels were assayed following transfection of HeLa cells as described previously (6Garcia A.D. Ostapchuk P. Hearing P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from suspension cultures of HeLa cells were prepared by the method of Dignam et al.(19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract was dialyzed against DB-100 (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The dialysate was clarified by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 min, and applied to DEAE-cellulose column (~500 mg total protein to a 50-ml column) equilibrated in DB-100. EF-C activity was in the flow-through fraction (~200 mg of total protein), which was dialyzed against 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% CHAPS. A cleared dialysate was loaded onto a hydroxylapapatite column (6 mg of protein/ml bed volume) equilibrated in phosphate dialysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a 20-400 mM potassium phosphate gradient. EF-C containing fractions were pooled (~25 mg of total protein) and dialyzed against DB-100 containing 5 mM DTT. A cleared dialysate was loaded onto a double-stranded calf thymus DNA column (5 mg of protein/ml bed volume) equilibrated in DB-100. Bound proteins were eluted with a 100 mM to 1 M KCl gradient in dialysis buffer. EF-C-containing fractions were pooled (~5 mg of total protein), dialyzed against DB-150, and applied to an EF-C site-specific DNA affinity column containing a multimerized EF-C site from the Py enhancer region, equilibated in DB-150, in the presence of 100 μg/ml single-stranded calf thymus DNA. The column was washed with DB-150, and bound proteins eluted in DB containing 1 M KCl (B1 fraction, ~50 μg of total protein). EF-C was enriched ~10,000-fold during purification with ~10% recovery of activity. The proteins present in pooled fractions containing EF-C activity obtained during purification were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and the gel was silver-stained (Fig. 3A). The arrow in Fig. 3A indicates the presumptive EF-C protein based on two properties of EF-C. 1) EF-C binding activity was estimated at ~140 kDa by UV cross-linking to a radiolabeled DNA binding site; 2) EF-C binding activity was found in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis slices, following elution and renaturation, migrating between 130 and 150 kDa (data not shown). The protein band indicated by the arrow is ~140 kDa in molecular mass and was highly enriched in the final EF-C containing fraction compared to fractions that lacked EF-C activity. RFX-1 was produced by in vitro translation of capped, in vitro transcribed RNA (15Reith W. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Silacci P. Berte C. Barras E. Fey S. Mach B. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1528-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) using a reticulocyte lysate translation extract (Promega) as suggested by the manufacturer. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed in a final volume of 12.5 μl and contained 0.5-1.0 μl of EF-C B1 fraction or 3-4 μl of in vitro translated RFX-1 in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 100 μg/ml single-stranded calf thymus DNA, and 40,000 cpm of probe (~2.0 fmol). The DNA binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30-60 min, and the resulting DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 4% (30:1) polyacrylamide gels run in 0.5 × TBE (25 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 25 mM borate, 0.5 mM EDTA) at 200 V at 4°C. In mobility shift assays in which antiserum was used, the RFX-1 polyclonal antiserum was diluted and added to the DNA binding reactions 30 min into the incubation, and the incubation continued for an additional 30 min. For off-rate analyses, binding reactions were performed for 30 min, at which time a 500-fold molar excess of cold competitor DNA was added to the binding reaction. Aliquots of the reactions were withdrawn at various times points and analyzed by gel mobility shift assay. OPCU footprinting and DEPC interference assays were performed as described previously(20Bolwig G.M. Bruder J.T. Hearing P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6555-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide binding site competitors have been described previously(11Garcia A.D. Ostapchuk P. Hearing P. Virology. 1991; 182: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We first compared the binding of EF-C purified from HeLa cells and RFX-1 produced by in vitro translation to EF-C and RFX-1 binding sites using a gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 2). The binding sites corresponded to the Py EF-C inverted repeat binding site and the DRA MHC class II promoter X box RFX-1 binding site; the nucleotide sequence of the binding sites in these probes is shown in Fig. 7. Affinity-purified HeLa cell EF-C formed a complex with the Py EF-C probe that represents dimeric protein binding to both arms of the inverted repeat (upper complex, lane -, affinity-purified EF-C + EF-C probe; see below). The faster migrating complexes in this lane appears to reflect EF-C protein breakdown during purification since the appearance of this complex is largely blocked by a mixture of protease inhibitors and these complexes generally are not evident in the starting material or in certain EF-C preparations (see Fig. 8 and 11, for example). A complex with similar mobility was observed using in vitro translated RFX-1, as well as a complex with faster mobility (lane -, in vitro translated RFX-1 + EF-C probe). The slowest migrating complex with RFX-1 corresponds to occupancy of both arms of the EF-C inverted repeat (see below) and has slightly reduced mobility in comparison to purified EF-C due to the high protein content in the reticulocyte lysate present in the binding reaction as confirmed by mixing experiments (data not shown). In contrast, the vast majority of the RFX-1 complex on the DRA X box RFX probe displayed the more rapid mobility (lane -, in vitro translated RFX-1 + RFX probe), which corresponds to monomeric RFX binding to the probe DNA(15Reith W. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Silacci P. Berte C. Barras E. Fey S. Mach B. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1528-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Purified EF-C and in vitro translated RFX-1 displayed identical patterns of binding on the EF-C probe when a series of specific (Py-EF-C-WT, HBV-EF-C, CMV-1, RF-X) and nonspecific (Py-EF-C-X, pBR) competitor DNAs were added to the binding reaction (100-fold molar excess to the probe DNA), including the specific competition of both binding proteins by a fragment from pBR322 DNA only when methylated at CpG dinucleotide base pairs (pBRmethversus pBR). The pattern of competition of monomeric RFX-1 to the RFX site was comparable except that the methylated pBR site was a weak competitor. The conclusion that EF-C and RFX-1 are identical or highly related activities was confirmed using a polyclonal rabbit antibody developed against purified RFX-1. This antibody recognized (supershifted) affinity-purified EF-C and in vitro translated RFX-1 (Fig. 3B) and recognized EF-C-specific complexes previously described (4Ostapchuk P. Scheirle G. Hearing P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2787-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 6Garcia A.D. Ostapchuk P. Hearing P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using different cell sources including HeLa, NIH 3T3 (MOP8), and HepG2 cells (Fig. 3C), all of which contain functional EF-C activity ((11Garcia A.D. Ostapchuk P. Hearing P. Virology. 1991; 182: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and (12Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Emery P. David E. Hearing P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6375-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and see below). Preimmune serum did not alter the mobility of these EF-C complexes. While this analysis does not address the possibility that RFX-1 may be present as mixed heterodimers in the different cellular extracts or that the antibody may cross-react with other members of the RFX family, these results indicate that EF-C and RFX-1 from a variety of cell sources are highly related, if not identical, activities. We conclude that EF-C purified from HeLa cell displays comparable binding properties to RFX-1, as previously found using crude nuclear extracts (12Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Emery P. David E. Hearing P. Mach B. Reith W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6375-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Zhang X.Y. Ferrat N.J. Asiedu C.K. Samac S. Peterlin B.M. Ehrlich M. Mol. Cell.

The positions of monomeric (M) and dimeric (D) RFX-1 are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To analyze the physical interaction of EF-C and RFX-1 with the Py EF-C binding site and the MHC class II promoter X box RFX-1 binding site, we performed DEPC interference and OPCU chemical footprinting assays using purified EF-C bound to the Py EF-C and DRA RFX binding sites, and DEPC interference assays with RFX-1 bound to these sites. The reticulocyte lysate precluded the use of in vitro translated RFX-1 in OPCU footprinting reactions (data not shown). The data are shown in Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:, and are summarized schematically in Fig. 7. Purified EF-C and RFX-1 displayed identical patterns of modification interference on both strands of each binding site (circles above and below sequences in Fig. 7). A more extensive pattern of interference sites were evident with the dimeric EF-C binding site probe in comparison to the DRA RFX half-site. Since this assay is limited by the purine residues that are are available for modification and whose modification have an impact on protein-DNA binding, OPCU chemical footprinting was used to analyze the extent of interaction of these proteins with the binding sites. These results (darkbars in Fig. 7) show that a broader segment of DNA is protected with the binding of EF-C to the Py inverted repeat in comparison to the DRA X box RFX-1 binding site. This supports the idea that only a monomeric subunit of the dimeric EF-C protein complex interacts with the X box half-site. Additionally, the region of protection and pattern of DEPC-interference of EF-C and RFX-1 on the DRA RFX binding site indicate that a monomer of RFX-1 or EF-C makes significant contacts within this binding site. Only two nucleotide contact sites were different when RFX-1 monomers and dimers were compared in DEPC interference assays (the leftmost two Gs on the upper strand of the Py EF-C site in Fig. 7; data not shown).Figure 5:DEPC interference assay of RFX-1 and purified EF-C at the DRA RFX binding site.

The EF-C consensus binding site represented in Fig. 1C represents a compilation of high affinity binding sites including the sites in the Py and HBV enhancer regions as well as two sites in the cytomegalovirus enhancer. Among these sites, 6 nucleotides are invariant. We mutated each of these sites using nonconservative nucleotide changes. These mutations were introduced into the Py enhancer region in a vector that carries an adjacent Py origin of DNA replication. With polyomavirus, there is a stringent requirement for the presence of a functional enhancer region adjacent to the origin of replication for efficient DNA replication in vivo. The effects of these mutations was first examined using in vitro binding analyses with purified EF-C and RFX-1 and the individual mutant sites as probes in binding reactions (Fig. 8). As predicted, each mutation reduced the binding of purified EF-C dramatically with the exception of mutation at nt position 8. Weak binding also was evident with a mutation at nt positions 2 and 12. Similar results were observed when the binding of in vitro translated RFX-1 to these sites was examined, with the exception that strong monomeric RFX-1 binding was evident with PM8 and PM12. The other mutant sites were dramatically reduced for monomeric and dimeric RFX-1 binding in vitro, even though the mutations are present on opposite arms of the inverted repeat (see Fig. 1C, PM2, PM3, and PM5 versus PM9). We conclude that the interaction of purified EF-C and monomeric or dimeric RFX-1 with nucleotides in both arms of the inverted repeat are required for stable DNA-protein interaction. It is clear that monomeric RFX-1 interacts with nucleotides outside the context of a single EF-C half-site. We tested these mutant sites for enhancer activity using two assays. The first was an in vivo DNA replication assay where the enhancement of Py DNA replication by the Py enhancer region was assayed in transfected murine NIH3T3 cells (MOP8) that express the Py large T antigen (Fig. 9A). The second was an in vivo transient expression assay where the enhancement of expression from the SV40 early promoter (enhancer-less vector) was assayed in transfected human HeLa cells (Fig. 9B). Quantitatively similar results were obtained with the two assays comparing the enhancer activity of the wild type Py enhancer to the enhancer regions containing EF-C site mutations. The effects of the mutations on EF-C and RFX-1 binding properties in vitro were virtually identical to the effects of the mutations on enhancer activity in vivo. With the replication assay (Fig. 9A), no replication was evident with the enhancer-less replication vector (ENH-). A significant effect of the intact enhancer (Py 5104-5177) was observed, while the deletion of the region containing the EF-C site (Py 5104-5159) strongly reduced this stimulation. Point mutation at positions 3, 5, and 9 reduced enhancer activity to the level observed when the EF-C site was deleted. Mutations at positions 2 and 12 also had significant, but less dramatic, effects. Mutation at position 8 had no effect on enhancer activity. With the expression assay (Fig. 9B), weak promoter activity was evident with the plasmid lacking an enhancer, while the wild type Py enhancer stimulated expression 7-fold. Mutations at positions 3, 5, and 9 reduced enhancer activity to background levels, while mutations at positions 2 and 12 had lesser effects and mutation at position 8 had only a modest effect. These results directly correlate the binding of EF-C to this site in vitro with enhancer function in vivo. Additionally, the comparison of results in vivo and in vitro with PM8 and PM12 show that while monomeric RFX-1 bound to both mutant sites in vitro, the activity of enhancer regions with mutations in these sites was quite different in vivo. Enhancer activity in vivo directly correlated with dimeric RFX-1 binding in vitro. This interpretation is supported by experiments with the HBV enhancer described below. We previously tested the functional properties of HBV enhancer regions carrying mutations that altered the spacing between the arms of the EF-C inverted repeat and found that the deletion of one base pair or the insertion of more than two base pairs strongly reduced transcriptional enhancer activity in transfected HeG2 hepatoblastoma cells(4Ostapchuk P. Scheirle G. Hearing P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2787-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The stable interaction of RFX-1 with certain EF-C half-sites in a mobility shift assay prompted us to test if monomeric RFX-1 interacts with the HBV EF-C site and to determine the effect of spacer mutations within this site on EF-C and RFX-1 binding. The analysis of monomeric RFX-1 binding was accomplished by in vitro translation of a truncated version of RFX-1 that lacks the C-terminal dimerization domain but retains the more N-terminal DNA binding domain and that binds as a monomer to the DRA X box binding site(15Reith W. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Silacci P. Berte C. Barras E. Fey S. Mach B. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1528-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no interaction of monomeric RFX-1 was observed with the HBV EF-C site even though this protein bound efficiently to the Py EF-C site and DRA X box RFX-1 binding site (data not shown). Binding analyses using full-length RFX-1 also showed only dimeric RFX-1 binding to the HBV EF-C site and not the binding of monomeric RFX-1 (data not shown). These results are consistent with the poor binding of purified EF-C that was observed to HBV sites carrying mutations that disrupt enhancer function (Fig. 10, Δ1, IS3, IS9, and IS10). These results indicate that while the HBV EF-C binding site displays dimeric EF-C and RFX-1 binding, either half-site of this binding element is intrinsically weak for monomeric RFX-1 interaction. We compared the binding of affinity-purified EF-C to the Py EF-C and DRA RFX binding sites using a competition binding assay (Fig. 11A). Binding reactions contained either the Py EF-C or DRA RFX binding site probe and increasing molar concentrations of homologous cold competitor DNAs added simultaneously with the probe DNA. These results demonstrated that the Py EF-C binding site was a better competitor for EF-C binding than the DRA RFX site. To test the possibility that the interaction of EF-C with a Py EF-C site inverted repeat may be intrinsically more stable than binding to the RFX DRA half-site, we performed off-rate analyses using these sites with purified EF-C as shown in Fig. 11B. Binding reactions were established where comparable levels of EF-C-DNA complexes were observed with the individual probes, and following a 30-min binding reaction, a 1000-fold molar excess of the same binding site was added as a cold competitor DNA to measure DNA-protein complex decay. With each probe, t0 - competitor shows the level of EF-C binding to each probe in the absence of specific competitor DNA. t0+ competitor represents the addition of the competitor simultaneously with the probe DNA. The remaining time points represent competitor DNA added after a 30-min EF-C binding reaction. These results clearly show that EF-C binding to the inverted repeat of the Py enhancer is stable, while EF-C binding to the RFX X box is unstable. Thus, even though EF-C makes extensive contacts with nucleotides within the RFX X box binding site (Fig. 7), the intrinsic binding of EF-C to this site is weak. Identical results were found when the binding of monomeric or dimeric RFX-1 to each site was compared (data not shown). Nuclear factor EF-C binds as a dimer to inverted repeat sequences in the polyomavirus and hepatitis B virus enhancer regions (Fig. 1(A and B), 3, and 4). EF-C corresponds to two seemingly unrelated activities that have been described. The first is MDBP, a protein that binds to certain DNA sites only when methylated at CpG dinucleotide base pairs(8Huang L.H. Wang R. Gaga-Sosa M.A. Shenoy S. Ehrlich M. Nature. 1984; 308: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Khan R. Zhang X.Y. Supakar P.C. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8611-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The second is RFX-1, a member of a family of related transcription factors that form homo- and heterodimers and that bind to the conserved and functionally important X box in MHC class II antigen promoter regions(14Reith W. Ucla C. Barras E. Gaud A. Durand B. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Mach B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1230-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this report, we have compared the binding of EF-C and RFX-1 in vitro to wild type and mutant binding sites in the HBV and Py enhancer regions with the function of these sites in vivo. These mutations result in the generation of EF-C half-sites that mimic the RFX-1 binding site in the MHC class II promoter. Our results demonstrate that the interaction of dimeric EF-C and RFX-1 with an intact inverted repeat is required for the functional activity of viral enhancer regions. This conclusion is supported by the observation that a point mutation in the Py enhancer region (PM12) that does not reduce the binding of monomeric RFX-1 to this site but does dramatically reduced dimeric RFX-1 and EF-C binding in vitro was greatly reduced for enhancer activity in vivo. Additionally, while the HBV EF-C site is critical for optimal enhancer activity in vivo, no interaction of monomeric RFX-1 was detected with the HBV enhancer in vitro while dimeric RFX-1 and EF-C bound efficiently. The RFA RFX-1 binding site has a 9-nucleotide pyrimidine stretch on the upper strand to the left of the EF-C half-site denoted in Fig. 7. Because dimethyl sulfate and DEPC interference assays would not reveal contacts of a protein within these nucleotides and because two T residues are positioned at an appropriate location relative to the EF-C consensus inverted repeat in this region (see Fig. 1C, labeled with asterisks in Fig. 7), it was possible that both partners of an EF-C/RFX-1 dimer contacted DNA at the DRA RFX site, similar to the interaction of the dimers with the viral EF-C inverted repeats. OPCU chemical footprinting assays, however, showed that a narrower segment of DNA was protected at the DRA RFX site with bound EF-C, which does not include protection of the aforementioned T residues. This result strongly suggests that the interaction of EF-C and RFX-1 with the DRA MHC class II promoter truly represents half-site interaction. While monomeric RFX-1 binds to the Py EF-C site, binding of monomeric RFX-1 to the HBV EF-C site was not detected. These sites differ notably in the 3 nucleotides in the spacer region between the arms of the EF-C inverted repeat. These binding results as well as the pattern of protein interaction evident from DEPC interference assays suggests that the composition of the spacer nucleotides strongly influences the binding of monomeric, but not dimeric, EF-C/RFX-1 to these sites. We note that the Py EF-C site and DRA RFX-1 binding site are identical at nine consecutive positions including five base pairs of the EF-C half-site and four base pairs corresponding to the spacer region. The fact that the intact EF-C inverted repeat binding site displayed very stable binding of EF-C and dimeric RFX-1 while half-site binding was unstable suggests that viral enhancer regions have evolved dimeric binding sites for stable EF-C/RFX-1 interaction to effectively compete with the cellular genome for binding of limiting concentrations of this transcription factor. Since the predominant form of EF-C detected in cellular extracts by gel mobility shift assay (Figure 8:, Figure 9:, Figure 10:, Figure 11:, for example) and in gel filtration experiments (data not shown) is that of a protein dimer, one would anticipate that certain cellular promoter and enhancer regions would display inverted repeat binding sites. Such binding sites have been uncovered by computer analysis and found to bind MDBP(21Zhang X.-Y. Asiedu C.K. Supakar P.C. Khan R. Ehrlich K.C. Ehrlich M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6253-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have found a perfect EF-C inverted repeat, which is virtually identical to the Py EF-C binding site, within the enhancer region of the CoA synthetase transcriptional control region; this site binds EF-C with high affinity (data not shown), although the functional importance of this site is not clear at the moment. Other functionally important EF-C/RFX-1 half-sites have been found in cellular promoter regions. RFX-1 binds to the rpL30 ribosomal protein-encoding gene at the α element, a sequence that strongly resembles the RFX-1 half-site in the DRA promoter(22Safrany G. Perry R.P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The unstable binding of EF-C/RFX-1 to a half-site suggests that an additional activity may be required to stabilize RFX-1 interaction with the MHC class II and rpL30 promoter regions. With the MHC class II promoter, a second regulatory element, the X2 box, overlaps the RFX-1 binding site and binds members of the leucine zipper family of transcription factors(23Liou H.C. Boothby M.R. Glimcher L. Science. 1988; 242: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Perhaps RFX-1 interacts with one or more of these activities. Additionally, it is clear that RFX-1 forms heterodimers with other family members, RFX-2 and RFX-3(14Reith W. Ucla C. Barras E. Gaud A. Durand B. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Mach B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1230-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). While RFX-2 and RFX-3 show the same binding specificity as RFX-1 is competition and footprinting experiments(14Reith W. Ucla C. Barras E. Gaud A. Durand B. Herrero-Sanchez C. Kobr M. Mach B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1230-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it is possible that specific heterodimeric combinations of these activities interact with a half-site with higher affinity. Finally, a recent report has shown that an additional RFX family member, which has not been cloned, binds cooperatively with NF-Y, a protein that binds to MHC class II promoter Y box located ~25 base pairs toward the transcription initiation site(24Reith W. Siegrist C.A. Durand B. Barras E. Mach B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). With the rpL30 ribosomal protein-encoding gene, the α element functions in conjunction with neighboring transcription factor binding sites(22Safrany G. Perry R.P. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 25Hariharan N. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and it is possible that similar cooperative interactions between RFX-1 and other proteins may occur. Perhaps through the use of different types of binding sites with varying binding affinities, the expression of certain sets of genes is regulated is cell-type specific manners dependent on the availability of other binding partners (e.g. RFX and NF-Y). Viruses may wish to circumvent such a limitation and therefore have evolved a site that binds a ubiquitous enhancer factor in a autonomous manner. We thank our colleagues for many helpful discussions and Tina Philipsberg for excellent technical help."

To follow the designation of other receptor subunits of the cytokine receptor superfamily, the different subunits of the Type I IFN-R are designated with Greek letters. Experiments performed with specific anti-Type I IFN receptor (IFN-R) monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have demonstrated that there are at least two receptor subunits designated as the α (110 kDa) and β (100 kDa) subunits(5Colamonici O.R.

Interestingly, expression of this subunit in mouse L-929 cells makes them responsive to human IFNα8 without a significant increase in human IFN binding(10Colamonici O.R. Porterfield B. Domanski P.

More importantly, knockout mice for the α subunit fail to respond to different viral agents underscoring the role of this subunit in the antiviral response(13Müller U. Steinhoff U. Reis L.F.L. Hemmi S. Pavlovic J. Zinkernagel R.M. Aguet M. Science. 1994; 264: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). However, the α subunit should also play a role in Type I IFN binding as indicated by cross-linking of this subunit to radioiodinated human IFNα2 (6Colamonici O.R. D'Alessandro F. Diaz M.O. Gregory S.A. Neckers L.M. Nordan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Xiong J. Carrasco N. Langer J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the α subunit of the Type I IFN-R is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine after IFN binding to the receptor (15Platanias L.C. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol.

Furthermore, one of the Janus tyrosine kinases involved in IFNα signaling, the p135tyk2 kinase, associates with and tyrosine phosphorylates the α subunit in vitro(9Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P.

Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3518-3522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have mapped the p135tyk2 binding domain to the 47 juxtamembrane amino acids of the α subunit. This region contains two tyrosine residues (tyrosines 466 and 481) that are the putative targets for p135tyk2 phosphorylation(9Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the α subunit binds human IFNα8, as well as IFNα2, IFNα7, IFNβ, and IFNω, when is part of the Type I IFN-R complex expressed in human cells. However, binding of human IFNα8, but not human IFNα2, can be detected in mouse cells even in the absence of the human α subunit. In this context, the response to human IFNα8 in mouse L-929 cells transfected with the α subunit is dependent on cross-binding of human IFNα8 to the mouse receptor. Since the α subunit is associated with and tyrosine phosphorylated by p135tyk2, we tested if this receptor subunit was able to activate this kinase in mouse cells. Our data indicate that activation of the p135tyk2 and JAK-1 tyrosine kinases(20Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G.

Since the JAK-1 tyrosine kinase does not associate with the α subunit, and it is not activated in cells transfected with vector alone, these data raise the possibility that the JAK-1 tyrosine kinase may be downstream of p135tyk2. Human recombinant IFNα2 was kindly provided by Drs. M. Brunda and P. Trotta (Hoffman-La Roche and Schering-Plough, respectively). IFNβ, IFNω, and IFNα8 were provided by Drs.

Cells were treated with different concentrations of IFNα2 for the indicated periods of time, rapidly centrifuged at 2000 × g for 30 s in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, and subsequently solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, 100 mM NaF, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4°C for 30 min. Protein complexes were precipitated from cell lysates with the indicated antibodies and protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Incubations ranged from 1 h to overnight, at 4°C. After three to five washes with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell). Nonspecific binding sites on the filter were blocked with 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 containing 5-8% bovine serum albumin or 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were subsequently incubated with the indicated primary antibodies and appropriate secondary antibodies (linked to horseradish peroxidase) and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corp.). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using an end labeled oligonucleotide (5′-GATCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3′ and 3′-CCCTTTCCCTTTGGCTTTGACTTCGGAG-5′) to detect ISGF3(25Gutch M.J.

Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) corresponds to what we have previously designated as the α subunit of the Type I IFN-R(9Colamonici O.R. Yan H.

However, differences in the molecular mass of this subunit have been reported. For instance, in human cells the α subunit has an molecular mass 110-120 kDa, whereas expression of the extracellular domain of this subunit in Sf9 or COS7 cells produces a protein with an molecular mass of 58 and 75 kDa, respectively(5Colamonici O.R.

To determine the molecular mass of the mature human α subunit protein expressed in mouse L-929 cells, we performed surface iodination experiments. Fig. 1 shows an experiment performed with mouse L-929 cells transfected with the α subunit cDNA (SVX.2 cells) or with retroviral vector alone (SV.1 cells). We selected the SVX.2 cell line to perform most experiments, because it expresses higher levels of the α subunit(9Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the IFNaR3 monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal serum(411-557) raised against the cytoplasmic domain of the α subunit detect a protein with an molecular mass of approximately 120 kDa in SVX.2 cells, but not in SV.1 cells. This result indicates that in SVX.2 cells the molecular mass of the α subunit is similar to that reported for the fully glycosylated form expressed in human cells(6Colamonici O.R. D'Alessandro F. Diaz M.O. Gregory S.A. Neckers L.M. Nordan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7230-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been reported previously that mouse cells that express the α subunit of the Type I IFN-R show an exclusive or more significant antiviral response to human IFNα8 than to other Type I IFN subtypes (7Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 10Colamonici O.R. Porterfield B. Domanski P. Constantinescu S. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol.

Table I, Table II show that SVX.1 and SVX.2 cells (transfected with the α subunit cDNA), but not SV.1 cells (transfected with vector alone), display a more significant antiviral response with human IFNα8 than with human IFNα2 for either encephalomyocarditis virus or vesicular stomatitis virus.Table I Open table in a new tab Table II Open table in a new tab In order to explain the differences observed with these two human Type I IFNs in mouse cells expressing the α subunit, we considered the following possibilities: 1) the α subunit is specific for human IFNα8; 2) since expression of this subunit in mouse cells does not increase human Type I IFN binding(10Colamonici O.R. Porterfield B. Domanski P. Constantinescu S. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9598-9602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the ability of a given human Type I IFN to trigger an antiviral response was conditioned by its ability to cross-bind to the mouse receptor. To test these possibilities, we first studied the ability of the α subunit to bind different Type I IFNs in human cells. We affinity-cross-linked radioiodinated IFNα2, IFNα7, IFNα8, IFNβ, and IFNω to the Type I IFN-R expressed in human cells. Fig. 2(A and B) shows that the IFNaR3 mAb precipitates an IFN-receptor complex with an molecular mass of 130-150 kDa (α subunit), as well as the high molecular mass complex corresponding to the association of the α and β subunits previously reported(4Colamonici O.R. Pfeffer L.M. D'Alessandro F. Platanias L. Rosolen A. Nordan R. Cruciani R.A. Diaz M.O. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2126-2132PubMed Google Scholar, 6Colamonici O.R. D'Alessandro F. Diaz M.O. Gregory S.A. Neckers L.M. Nordan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7230-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The complexes were more prominent with radioiodinated IFNα2, IFNα8, and IFNβ. IFNα7 and IFNω were cross-linked to the receptor with lower efficiency than other IFNs. However, a weak band corresponding to the α subunit cross-linked to radioiodinated IFNα7 and IFNω is detected by the IFNaR3 mAb. These results suggest that the α subunit is not specific for human IFNα8 and that it binds different Type I IFNs, in association with other receptor components, when expressed in human cells. Although the α subunit-radioiodinated IFN complex (130-150 kDa) resolved in most experiments as a wide band (Fig. 2 IFNα2, IFNα8, and IFNβ), in some experiments the α subunit also resolved as a doublet (Fig. 3, U-266 cells, and data not shown).Figure 3:Human IFNα8 binds to the mouse Type I IFN-R. Radioiodinated human IFNα2 and human IFNα8 were cross-linked to the receptor expressed in mouse SV.1 and SVX.2 cells. Lysates were precipitated with an anti-IFNα serum or with the anti-α subunit mAb IFNaR3. Cross-linking of radioiodinated IFNα8 to U-266 cell was used as a positive control. The bands corresponding to the α and β subunits are indicated. The difference in electrophoretic mobility observed in SV.1 and SVX.2 for the IFNα8-receptor complex are due to an artifact produced when the gel was dried.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next studied the ability of mouse SV.1 and SVX.2 cells to bind human IFNα2 and human IFNα8. Since it is not possible to measure human IFNα2 or human IFNα8 binding in these mouse cell lines(10Colamonici O.R. Porterfield B. Domanski P. Constantinescu S. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9598-9602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we performed affinity cross-linking experiments. Fig. 3 shows that radiolabeled human IFNα8 can be cross-linked to the mouse receptor expressed in both SV.1 and SVX.2 cells even in the absence of the human α subunit. This is supported by the finding that the IFNα8-receptor complexes are precipitated by an antibody against the ligand (anti-IFNα serum) and not by the anti-α subunit antibody IFNaR3. It should be noticed that very weak precipitation of the human α subunit cross-linked to human IFNα8 was detected by the IFNaR3 mAb in SVX.2 cells in long exposures of the autoradiograms (data not shown). Interestingly, no detectable amounts of IFNα2 cross-linked to the receptor were detected using this method. The detection of the α subunit as a doublet in human U-266 cells (positive control) could correspond to the different electrophoretic mobility species previously reported for IFNα8 (28Meister A. Uzé G. Mogensen K.E. Gresser I. Tovey M.G. Grütter M. Meyer F. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 1633-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or to the presence of two binding sites in this chain of the receptor as previously proposed by Bazan(29Bazan J.F. Cell. 1990; 61: 753-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The binding of IFNα8, but not IFNα2, to the mouse cells indicates that the mouse receptor is involved in human IFNα8 binding. Thus, the human IFNα-induced antiviral response observed in L-929 mouse cells expressing the human α subunit is dependent on cross-binding of a particular human Type I IFN to the mouse receptor. In this context, the human α subunit provides for species specificity. Binding of Type I IFNs to the receptor triggers tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the p135tyk2 and JAK-1 tyrosine kinases, as well as the transcriptional factor ISGF3. Moreover, p135tyk2 directly associates with and tyrosine phosphorylates the α subunit(9Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the α subunit can transduce the signal for an antiviral response, we studied whether this subunit is able to activate the different components of the IFN signaling pathway such as the p135tyk2 and JAK-1 tyrosine kinases and consequently the transcriptional factor ISGF3. The SV.1 and SVX.2 cells were treated for 10 min at 37°C with human IFNα8, murine IFNαβ, or left untreated. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-tyk2 and -JAK-1 sera, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. Fig. 4(upper panel) shows that murine IFNαβ can induce rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the p135tyk2 and JAK-1 tyrosine kinases in both L-929 cells transfected with vector alone (SV.1) and with vector containing the α subunit cDNA (SVX.2). More importantly, human IFNα8 exclusively induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p135tyk2 and JAK-1 in SVX.2 cells transfected with the human α subunit cDNA. The absence of IFNα8-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the JAK kinases in SV.1 cells indicates that binding of this human IFN to the mouse receptor is not sufficient to activate these kinases. No tyrosine phosphorylation of the JAK tyrosine kinases was observed when human IFNα2 was used (data not shown). We also determined if transmembrane signaling by the α subunit was enough to activate the transcriptional factor ISGF3. We obtained nuclear extracts from SV.1 and SVX.2 cells after treatment with murine IFNαβ, human IFNα2, and human IFNα8 for 1 h. Human IFNα8 specifically induced formation of the ISGF3 complex in SVX.2 cells, but not in SV.1 cells (Fig. 5A), whereas murine IFNαβ induced ISGF3 formation in both SV.1 and SVX.2 cells. Fig. 5B shows that the formation of the ISGF3 complex is blocked by a 50-fold excess unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 5B, lane 3), and by polyclonal serum against human Stat1α (38Gilmour K.C. Reich N.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 6850-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (lane 6), but not by normal rabbit serum (lane 7), further indicating that the complex corresponds to ISGF3. A weak band observed with human IFNα2 in SVX.2 cells is a background band that comigrates with ISGF3, but it does not react with anti-ISGF3 antibodies (data not shown). Mouse cells expressing the subunit of the Type I IFN-R cloned by Uzéet al.(7Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) are protected against vesicular stomatitis virus challenge by human IFNα8. This subunit of the receptor corresponds to a receptor component recognized by the IFNaR1, IFNaR2, and IFNaR3 mAbs that we previously designated as the α subunit(9Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of this subunit in mouse cells confers an antiviral response to human IFNα8, but not to human IFNα2 or IFNβ (7Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 10Colamonici O.R. Porterfield B. Domanski P. Constantinescu S. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol.

However, the increase in antiviral activity is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in human IFN binding(10Colamonici O.R. Porterfield B. Domanski P. Constantinescu S. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9598-9602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike rodent cells transfected with the α subunit, rodent cells carrying human chromosome 21 are able to bind and respond to different human Type I IFNs(30Tan Y.H. Schneider E.L. Tischfield J. Epstein C.J. Ruddle F.H. Science. 1974; 186: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Tan Y.H. Nature. 1976; 260: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 32Revel M. Bash D.

Genet. 1990; 16: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As expected, the gene for the α subunit is localized on human chromosome 21(36Lutfalla G. Gardiner K. Proudhon D. Vielh E. Uzé G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2802-2809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that rodent cells transfected with the α subunit do not show an increase in Type I IFN binding and only respond to IFNα8 suggested that there should be a second receptor component in this region of human chromosome 21. With the help of a new specific monoclonal antibody against what it was designated as the β subunit of the receptor, we demonstrated that two receptor components are localized on the same area of human chromosome 21(5Colamonici O.R. Domanski P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10895-10899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a second Type I IFN-R component in this human chromosome has been recently confirmed using hamster cells transfected with a yeast artificial chromosome that contains the q22.1 region of human chromosome 21(11Cleary C.M. Donnelly R.J. Soh J. Mariano T.M. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18747-18749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Soh J. Mariano T.M. Lim J.-K. Izotova L. Mirochnitchenko O. Schwartz B. Langer J.A. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18102-18110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA different than the α subunit has been recently cloned by Novick et al.(8Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). It remains to be confirmed if this cDNA maps to human chromosome 21. It has not been elucidated why there are differences in the antiviral response to human IFNα2, IFNβ, and IFNα8 in cells transfected with the α subunit of the Type I IFN-R. One possibility would be that the α subunit is specific for IFNα8. This idea has been challenged by two findings: 1) a monoclonal antibody produced against the recombinant protein produced in COS7 cells is able to block the biological activity of different Type I IFNs(19Benoit P. Maguire D. Plavec I. Kocher H. Tovey M. Meyer F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 707-716PubMed Google Scholar), and 2) the α subunit can be cross-linked to IFNα2 in human cells(4Colamonici O.R. Pfeffer L.M. D'Alessandro F. Platanias L. Rosolen A. Nordan R. Cruciani R.A. Diaz M.O. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2126-2132PubMed Google Scholar, 6Colamonici O.R. D'Alessandro F. Diaz M.O. Gregory S.A. Neckers L.M. Nordan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7230-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when we performed affinity cross-linking experiments with different radioiodinated Type I IFNs followed by immunoprecipitation with the specific anti-α subunit mAb IFNaR3, our results indicated that the α subunit can be cross-linked to different Type I IFNs when expressed in human cells. However, similar experiments performed in mouse L-929 cells demonstrated that human IFNα8, but not human IFNα2, was able to bind to the mouse Type I IFN-R even in the absence of the human α subunit. Mouse cells expressing the α subunit respond to human IFNα8, because this IFNα, unlike IFNα2, binds to the mouse receptor. In this context the human α subunit is necessary for the species specificity of the antiviral response. Our results also indicate that the α subunit expressed in mouse L-929 cells has an molecular mass similar to that observed in human cells. This result confirms a previous report (37Platanias L.C. Pfeffer L.M. Cruciani R. Colamonici O.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3226-3230Google Scholar) that indicated that the α subunit is heavily glycosylated. Since expression of the human α subunit in mouse L-929 cells suffices to trigger an antiviral effect in response to IFNα8, we sought to determine which components of the IFNα signaling pathway were activated by transmembrane signaling through this subunit. We previously reported that p135tyk2 associates and tyrosine-phosphorylates the α subunit(9Colamonici O.R. Yan H. Domanski P. Handa R. Smalley D. Mullersman J. Witte M. Krishnan K. Krolewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8133-8142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Colamonici O.R. Uyttendaele H. Domanski P. Yan H. Krolewski J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3518-3522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but we have not detected association of this subunit with JAK-1. Moreover, it has been reported that the JAK-1 kinase associates with a different receptor component recently cloned by Novick et al.(8Novick D. Cohen B. Rubinstein M. Cell. 1994; 77: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that IFNα8 specifically triggers the transmembrane signaling by the α subunit with the consequent activation of the p135tyk2 and JAK-1 tyrosine kinases. The activation of these kinases was accompanied by formation of ISGF3 as detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Our data further support a direct relationship between activation of the JAK tyrosine kinases, induction of the ISGF3 complex, and antiviral response in mouse cells transfected with the α subunit. The presence of functional JAK-1 and p135tyk2 kinases appears to be necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of p135tyk2 and JAK-1 in response to IFNα, suggesting that these tyrosine kinases may cross-activate each other simultaneously or in a cascade(20Müller M. Briscoe J. Laxton C. Guschin D. Ziemiecki A. Silvennoinen O. Harpur A.G. Barbieri G. Witthunh B.A. Schindler C. Pellegrini S. Wilks A.F. Ihle J.N. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Since p135tyk2 associates with the α subunit, the activation by tyrosine phosphorylation of this JAK tyrosine kinase is not surprising. However, JAK-1 does not seem to be activated through the mouse β subunit as indicated by the lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK-1 in response to IFNα8 in cells transfected with vector alone. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of the JAK-1 tyrosine kinase should be explained by a different mechanism: 1) JAK-1 is downstream of p135tyk2 in the IFNα pathway. In this case the activation of p135tyk2 leads to the direct or indirect activation of JAK-1. 2) JAK-1 is activated through the α subunit in an p135tyk2-independent pathway. In this case, the JAK-1 tyrosine kinase may associate to the α subunit through an intermediary protein such as the adapters associated to other cytokine receptors. Since binding of human IFNα8 to the mouse receptor is involved in the antiviral effect of cells expressing the human α subunit, the contribution of each receptor to the IFN response cannot be determined. To answer these questions, we are developing hybrid cytokine receptors in which the binding domain of α subunit of the IL2R is linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the α subunit of the IFN-R. In this system, IL2 should induce transmembrane signaling exclusively through the cytoplasmic domain of the α subunit of the Type I IFN-R.
