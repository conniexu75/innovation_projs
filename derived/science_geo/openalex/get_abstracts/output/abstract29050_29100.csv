https://openalex.org/W1598513412,"A sensitive exonuclease assay revealed multiple sites for interaction, in vitro, of sequence specific factors with c-myc upstream elements. At one site, more than 1500 base pairs upstream of the c-myc promoter P1, binding activity was lost as dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) induced shut-off of c-myc expression in HL-60 and U-937 leukemia cells. The disappearance of other specific binding activities was not noted. In addition, the binding activity was noted to be cell-line specific. The sequence binding the Me2SO-regulated factor was precisely located allowing confirmation of the temporal pattern of regulation by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. Because the binding activity was most abundant before the decrease of c-myc expression during differentiation, it was inferred that the far upstream element (FUSE) served a positive role, potentiating c-myc expression. A 4-base pair deletion which eliminated binding to FUSE also reduced expression of a transfected, chimeric c-myc-CAT gene in untreated, but not in Me2SO-treated U-937 cells. FUSE and its binding protein may contribute to cell line- and differentiation-specific modes of c-myc regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1639774771,"Three derivatives of a triantennary glycopeptide, each containing a single uniquely located 6-amino-galactose residue at either position 6', 6, or 8, were modified at the 6-amino group by attachment of a photolyzable reagent and radiolabeled by iodination of tyrosine. These were allowed to bind to the asialoglycoprotein receptor of isolated rat hepatocytes and photolyzed for affinity labeling. (formula; see text) Each probe specifically labeled either the major (RHL1) or minor (RHL2/3) subunits which comprise the receptor. A photolyzable group attached to galactose residue 6 6' specifically radiolabeled RHL1, whereas a photolyzable group attached to galactose 8 specifically labeled RHL2/3. Photoaffinity labeling of a soluble rat hepatic lectin preparation demonstrated that the minor subunits (RHL2/3) were no longer labeled by the triantennary probe with a photolyzable group at galactose 8. The inhibitory potency of a variety of complex glycopeptides against radiolabeled ligand binding to both rat hepatocytes and soluble lectin are in agreement with photoaffinity results that galactose 8 of triantennary glycopeptide is of unique importance by binding solely to the minor subunits (RHL2/3) of the asialoglycoprotein receptor on hepatocytes. Conversely, galactose residues 6 and 6' bind specifically to the major subunit (RHL1), indicating a precise binding geometry between the trivalent ligand and lectin."
https://openalex.org/W2077352206,"Drug policy should strike the right balance between reducing the harm done by psychoactive drugs and reducing the harm that results from strict legal prohibitions and their enforcement. It is concluded, from a cost-benefit analysis based on pharmacologic, toxicologic, sociologic, and historical facts, that radical steps to repeal the prohibitions on presently illicit drugs would be likely, on balance, to make matters worse rather than better. Specific recommendations are offered for ameliorating the dangers to users and to society that are posed by each addictive drug."
https://openalex.org/W1599513095,"In a previous study we have shown that normal rat kidney (NRK) cells in vitro secrete a 69-kDa osteopontin in both phosphorylated (pp69) and nonphosphorylated (np69) forms. Only pp69 interacts with the cell surface and np69 forms a heat-dissociable complex with plasma fibronectin, suggesting functional modulation of osteopontin by phosphorylation. Using tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, and peptide:N-glycosidase F, which removes N-linked oligosaccharide chains from glycoproteins, we show here that np69, but not pp69, contains N-linked carbohydrates. Our results also demonstrate that tunicamycin treatment does not inhibit the cell surface binding of pp69; however, np69 secreted by the treated cells fails to complex with plasma fibronectin, suggesting importantly, our data show that pp69 forms a heat-stable complex with cell surface fibronectin, suggesting that it is an integral component of the extracellular matrix of NRK cells. Finally, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of deglycosylated and in vitro translated osteopontin suggests that the acidic nature of osteopontin as well as its post-translational modifications play a role in the anomalous behavior of osteopontin in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, observed in several laboratories. The data presented here provide evidence for possible functional roles of 69-kDa osteopontin and suggest that its physiological properties are regulated by post-translational modifications."

https://openalex.org/W1502280728,"The presence of manganese (Mn2+) significantly increases the binding of the platelet surface receptor GPIIb/IIIa to two synthetic peptides Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro (GRGDSP) and Leu-Gly-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gln-Ala-Gly-Asp-Val (L10) that contain the recognition sequences RGD and KQAGDV, respectively. This results in an increase in the amount of GPIIb/IIIa adsorbed by GRGDSPK- and L10-Sepharose by 12-20-fold. Additionally, Mn2+ eliminates contaminating platelet vitronectin receptor, alpha v beta 3, which copurifies with GPIIb/IIIa on the peptide affinity columns in the absence of Mn2+. In contrast to this increased peptide binding of GPIIb/IIIa, Mn2+ reduces the binding of GPIIb/IIIa to its macromolecular RGD-containing ligands fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vitronectin. These results could mean that Mn2+ changes the structure of the binding site on GPIIb/IIIa such that it is now better suited to accommodate conformations available to the RGD sequence within short, linear synthetic peptides but not available to the RGD sequences within the natural ligands. To support this hypothesis we tested a conformationally restricted cyclic peptide, cyclic 2,10-GPenGHRGDLRCA, which in competition assays, preferentially inhibits the binding of GPIIb/IIIa to fibrinogen but does not inhibit well the binding of other RGD-dependent integrins, alpha v beta 3 and alpha 5 beta 1 to their respective ligands. In such assays, the presence of Mn2+ dramatically changed the binding specificity of GPIIb/IIIa by shifting the preference of the receptor away from the selective peptide, cyclic 2,10-GPen-GHRGDLRCA toward the nonselective GRGDSP peptide. This shift parallels the Mn2(+)-dependent change of the binding of GPIIb/IIIa to its natural protein ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1489610462,"The in vitro adenovirus (Ad) DNA replication system provides an assay to study the interaction of viral and host replication proteins with the DNA template in the formation of the preinitiation complex. This initiation system requires in addition to the origin DNA sequences 1) Ad DNA polymerase (Pol), 2) Ad preterminal protein (pTP), the covalent acceptor for protein-primed DNA replication, and 3) nuclear factor I (NFI), a host cell protein identical to the CCAAT box-binding transcription factor. The interactions of these proteins were studied by coimmunoprecipitation and Ad origin DNA binding assays. The Ad Pol can bind to origin sequences only in the presence of another protein which can be either pTP or NFI. While NFI alone can bind to its origin recognition sequence, pTP does not specifically recognize DNA unless Ad Pol is present. Thus, protein-protein interactions are necessary for the targetting of either Ad Pol or pTP to the preinitiation complex. DNA footprinting demonstrated that the Ad DNA site recognized by the pTP.Pol complex was within the first 18 bases at the end of the template which constitutes the minimal origin of replication. Mutagenesis studies have defined the Ad Pol interaction site on NFI between amino acids 68-150, which overlaps the DNA binding and replication activation domain of this factor. A putative zinc finger on the Ad Pol has been mutated to a product that fails to bind the Ad origin sequences but still interacts with pTP. These results indicate that both protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions mediate specific recognition of the replication origin by Ad DNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1605872139,"alpha-Spectrin, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and caldesmon have been detected in the nuclei of rat liver cells by 125I-calmodulin overlay, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemical methods. alpha-Spectrin is localized in the nuclear matrix, nuclear envelope, and nuclear pores. It has also been detected inside the nuclei in the form of small aggregates. MLCK is present in the nuclear matrix, envelope, nucleoli, and in a nuclease extract (S1 subfraction) but not in the nuclear pores. Caldesmon shows a diffuse distribution pattern inside the nuclei but it is not present in the nucleoli. Since all these proteins are components of the actin-myosin motility systems the presence of actin in the different nuclear subfractions has also been investigated: actin is present in the nuclear matrix, nuclear envelope, nucleoli, and nuclear pores. Proliferative activation of rat liver cells in vivo by partial hepatectomy induces the increase of alpha-spectrin, MLCK, and actin in different nuclear subfractions. This, together with the increase of nuclear calmodulin at the same time after hepatectomy (Pujol, M. J., Soriano, M., Aligue, R., Carafoli, E., and Bachs, O. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18863-18865), indicates that nuclear calmodulin could activate a nuclear contractile system during proliferative activation. A 62-kDa protein (p62) which binds to calmodulin columns and shows immunological similarities to caldesmon is specifically located in the region surrounding the nuclear envelope and is associated with the heterochromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1569714980,"Platelets normally circulate in a quiescent state. When activated, they undergo biochemical and morphological changes which greatly alter their function and contribute to their role in thrombosis and hemostasis. We have identified, cloned, and sequenced a cDNA from a human unbilical vein endothelial cell library that encodes a 110-kDa integral membrane protein. This protein is present on the surface of activated but not resting platelets and has previously been identified as lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1). Half-maximal surface expression of platelet LAMP-1 was induced by concentrations of thrombin that resulted in lysosome enzyme release, not alpha-, or dense granule release. Also consistent with lysosome enzyme studies, there was little surface expression of LAMP-1 in response to the weak agonists ADP and epinephrine. In addition, sucrose density gradient fractionation of platelet granules showed colocalization of LAMP-1 with the lysosomal enzyme, beta-galactosidase, and not with markers of alpha- or dense granules. While we found virtually no LAMP-1 on the resting platelet surface (0-90 molecules/cell), we estimated a mean of 1175 LAMP-1 molecules on the thrombin-activated platelet surface. The translocation of this heavily glycosylated protein to the platelet surface upon stimulation may play a role in the adhesive, prothrombic nature of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2096793161,"A high affinity [3H]ryanodine receptor has been solubilized from rabbit brain membranes and biochemically characterized. [3H]Ryanodine binding to rabbit brain membranes is specific and saturable, with a Kd of 1.3 nM. [3H]Ryanodine binding is enriched in membranes from the hippocampus but is significantly lower in membranes from the brain stem and spinal cord. Approximately 60% of [3H]ryanodine-labeled receptor is solubilized from brain membranes using 2.5% CHAPS and 10 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine containing 1 M NaCl. The solubilized brain [3H]ryanodine receptor sediments through sucrose gradients like the skeletal receptor as a large (approximately 30 S) complex. Solubilized receptor is specifically immunoprecipitated by sheep polyclonal antibodies against purified skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor coupled to protein A-Sepharose. [3H]Ryanodine-labeled receptor binds to heparin-agarose, and a protein of approximately 400,000 Da, which is cross-reactive with two polyclonal antibodies raised against the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor, elutes from the column and is enriched in peak [3H]ryanodine binding fractions. These results suggest that the approximately 400,000-Da protein is the brain form of the high affinity ryanodine receptor and that it shares several properties with the skeletal ryanodine receptor including a large oligomeric structure composed of approximately 400,000-Da subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1582421933,"Abstract Using specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, the induction, synthesis and subcellular localization of 69- and 100-kDa forms of 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase (p69 and p100) were investigated in alpha-interferon-treated human HeLa and Daudi cells. Although both p69 and p100 were induced by interferon, there were significant differences in the interferon dose-response and the kinetics of synthesis of each protein in these cell lines. Both proteins are localized mainly in the cytoplasm. However, immunoenzymatic staining analysis of interferon-treated cells indicated that a proportion of p69 is concentrated around the nuclei and the rest is distributed in a specific pattern in the cytoplasm whereas p100 is found in a diffuse state in the cytoplasm. In accord with its association to cell membranes, p69 is myristilated. The [35S]cysteine and [3H]myristate-labeled p69 preparations were resolved by two-dimensional gel isoelectric focusing with pI values in the pH range of 7.0-8.0 and 7.0-7.5, respectively. These observations suggested the existence of two forms of p69 which might be complexed together as a dimer. In favor with a dimeric form of p69, in gel filtration experiments the peak of p69 was routinely found in fractions corresponding to a molecular mass of 160 kDa whereas p100 was recovered as a monomer. Taken together, these results indicate that p69 and p100 have distinct characteristics and that their expression is a specific property of each cell type in response to interferon."
https://openalex.org/W1607954709,"Single-chain antibody of the (NH2) VL-linker-VH (COOH) design, was constructed based on prototype high affinity anti-fluorescein monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4-4-20. Purified single-chain antibody (SCA) 4-4-20/212 was studied relative to Ig mAb 4-4-20 in terms of ligand binding, kinetics, idiotypy, metatypy, and stability in denaturing agents. Ligand-binding data correlated with metatypic relatedness of the liganded site. Anti-metatypic reagents reacted preferentially with the liganded conformer of the 4-4-20 antibody active site and were unreactive with free ligand and the non-liganded (idiotypic) state. All results were consistent with the conclusion that SCA 4-4-20/212, with a 14-amino acid linker folded into a native conformational state that closely simulated the prototypical mAb. Furthermore, GndHCl unfolding and refolding studies demonstrated H and L chain variable domain intrinsic stability between SCA 4-4-20/212 and a 50 kDa antigen-binding fragment were nearly identical. This suggested CH1 and CL domain interactions may be more prevalent in V region molecular dynamics than structure."
https://openalex.org/W1535383978,Abstract A combination of site-directed mutagenesis and amino acid sequence analysis identifies Tyr-343 of Flp recombinase as the residue that covalently attaches to DNA during the strand-cleavage step of recombination. This residue is part of the invariant His-Arg-Tyr triad of the Int family of recombinases. Tyr-343 is located in a highly protease-accessible (and hence open) region of Flp. This placement may provide the conformational flexibility required for the dual role of Tyr-343 in recombination: nicking of the DNA strands to initiate recombination and joining of the nicked strands across partner substrates to complete recombination. In-frame insertion of a few amino acids close to Tyr-343 (and to its amino-terminal side) does not affect substrate recognition by Flp but abolishes its catalytic function.

https://openalex.org/W1499524496,"Refeeding starved chicks causes a 25- to 50-fold increase in the level of malic enzyme mRNA in liver. To define the regulated steps, we measured transcriptional activity of the malic enzyme gene using the nuclear run-on assay and a variety of DNA probes specific to the malic enzyme gene. Refeeding starved chicks stimulated transcription of the malic enzyme gene in liver by 40- to 50-fold. An increased transcription rate was detectable at 1.5 h, was maximal at 3 h, and remained high at 24 h of refeeding. The level of nuclear precursor RNA for malic enzyme assessed by hybridization with intron-specific probes was high in liver of refed birds, and barely detectable in that of starved birds. These results indicate that nutritional regulation of the level of malic enzyme mRNA is transcriptional. Low levels of malic enzyme mRNA in brain, kidney, and heart correlated well with low rates of transcription of the malic enzyme gene in these tissues. In contrast to liver, neither the rate of transcription nor the steady-state level of malic enzyme mRNA was affected by refeeding starved birds. A series of DNase I-hypersensitive sites were located within 4000 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site of the malic enzyme gene in liver. The DNase I-hypersensitive region extending from the start of transcription to 400 base pairs upstream was much more pronounced in the refed state than in the starved state. This change in DNase I hypersensitivity followed the same time course as increased transcription of the malic enzyme gene. This DNase I-hypersensitive region also was present at low intensity in kidney and heart independently of nutritional state. The three constitutive DNase I-hypersensitive sites further upstream were present in liver but not in kidney or heart."

https://openalex.org/W1557392502,"The sterol synthesis inhibitor 6-fluoromevalonate (Fmev) was used to explore the role of mevalonate products in lymphocyte proliferation. Fmev blocks the synthesis of isopentenyl pyrophosphate and all more distal products in the sterol pathway. When cells were cultured in lipoprotein-deficient medium, Fmev (200 microM) completely inhibited mitogen-stimulated human lymphocyte proliferation, quantified by measuring DNA synthesis. The addition of low density lipoprotein (LDL) restored lymphocyte responses to normal, whereas mevalonate was totally ineffective. Similar results were obtained with concentrations of Fmev up to 1 mM. These results contrast with those observed when sterol biosynthesis was blocked with lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. When lymphocyte proliferation was blocked with lovastatin (5 microM), either high concentrations of mevalonate or LDL together with low concentrations of mevalonate was required to restore responses. In contrast, neither LDL nor low concentrations of mevalonate when alone was able to restore lymphocyte DNA synthesis in cultures blocked with 5 microM lovastatin. The effect of Fmev on the capacity of exogenous mevalonate to restore proliferation of lovastatin-blocked lymphocytes was directly examined. Fmev had no effect on the capacity of LDL plus low concentrations of mevalonate to restore DNA synthesis to lovastatin-blocked lymphocytes, indicating that the synthesis of the necessary factor from mevalonate was unaltered by Fmev. Fmev profoundly blocked lymphocyte endogenous sterol synthesis, decreasing incorporation of radiolabeled acetate into digitonin-precipitable sterols by up to 98%. LDL did not alter the capacity of Fmev to block sterol synthesis. The possibility that Fmev allowed shunting of endogenous mevalonate into essential lipid products was assessed by examining the incorporation of radiolabeled mevalonate. Fmev (200 microM) inhibited the incorporation of mevalonate into all lipids, including ubiquinone, dolichol, and other non-sterol lipids by up to 98%, and this was not altered by LDL. Furthermore, Fmev (200 microM) suppressed the incorporation of radiolabeled mevalonate into protein by up to 97%. These data confirm that a product of mevalonate is essential for cell proliferation. However, the results indicate that the required product is directly synthesized from mevalonate or mevalonate phosphates rather than from a more distal isoprenoid metabolite."
https://openalex.org/W1580322940,"Multiple factors affect the thrombin-catalyzed conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, including: fibrinopeptide (FPA and FPB) release leading to exposure of two types of polymerization domains (A and B, respectively) in the central portion of the molecule, and exposure of a noncatalytic thrombin-binding site in fibrin. Fibrinogen containing the FPA sequence but lacking the B beta 1-42 sequence (des-(B beta 1-42)-fibrinogen), was compared to native fibrinogen (containing both FPA and FPB) to investigate the role played by B beta 1-42 in the polymerization of alpha-fibrin (i.e. fibrin lacking FPA), to compare reptilase and thrombin cleavage of FPA from fibrinogen, and to explore the location and function of the secondary thrombin-binding site. Electron microscopy of evolving polymer structures (mu, 0.14; pH 7.4) plus turbidity measurements, showed that early thin fibril formation as well as subsequent lateral fibril associations were impaired in des-(B beta 1-42)-alpha-fibrin, thus indicating that the B beta 1-42 sequence contributes to the A polymerization site. Reptilase-activated des-(B beta 1-42)-alpha-fibrin polymerized even more slowly than thrombin-activated des-(B beta 1-42)-alpha-fibrin, differences that disappeared when repolymerization of preformed fibrin monomers was carried out. Since existing data indicate that thrombin releases FPA in a concerted manner, resulting in relatively rapid evolution of fully functional divalent alpha-fibrin monomers, it can be inferred that delayed fibrin assembly of reptilase fibrin is due to slower formation of divalent alpha-fibrin monomers. Thrombin-activated des-(B beta 1-42)-alpha-fibrin polymerized more rapidly at low ionic strength (mu, 0.04) than did native alpha,beta-fibrin, a reversal of their behavior at physiological ionic strength (mu, 0.14). Concomitant measurement of FPA release revealed modest slowing of release at low ionic strength from des-(B beta 1-42)-fibrinogen (t1/2, 36.5 versus 21.5 min) and marked slowing from native fibrinogen (t1/2, 138 versus 22.2 min). This behavior correlated with increased thrombin binding to native alpha,beta-fibrin at low ionic strength, coupled with weak thrombin binding to des-(B beta 1-42)-alpha-fibrin, and indicates that secondary thrombin binding plays an important role in regulating thrombin diffusion and catalytic activity. Des-(B beta 1-42)-fibrinogen lacks or has a markedly defective secondary thrombin-binding site, from which we conclude that the B beta 15-42 sequence in fibrin plays a major role in forming or providing this site."
https://openalex.org/W1534670700,"Clathrin light chains are calcium-binding proteins (Mooibroek, M. J., Michiel, D. F., and Wang, J. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 25-28) and clathrin assembly can be modulated by calcium in vitro. Thus, intracellular calcium may play a regulatory role in the function of clathrin-coated vesicles. The structural basis for calcium's influence on clathrin-mediated processes has been defined using recombinant deletion mutants and isolated fragments of the light chains. A single calcium-binding site, formed by residues 85-96, is present in both mammalian light chains (LCa and LCb) and in the single yeast light chain. This sequence has structural similarity to the calcium-binding EF-hand loops of calmodulin and related proteins. In mammalian light chains, the calcium-binding sequence is flanked by domains that regulate clathrin assembly and disassembly."

https://openalex.org/W1677335197,"Triantennary glycopeptide was oxidized with galactose oxidase to convert the -CH2OH group on terminal galactose residues to the aldehyde group (oxo-form). Kinetic profiling by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography allowed termination of the reaction when intermediate mono-oxo- and di-oxo-triantennary glycopeptides had been produced. The mixture of the oxo-glycopeptides was derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine for efficient separation, and each isomeric triantennary hydrazone was separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The purified hydrazones were reverted to three original isomeric mono-oxo- and di-oxo-glycopeptides, and a single tri-oxo-glycopeptide. Each of these isomers was characterized by proton NMR by a downfield shift in the anomeric signals of 6-oxo-Gal residue(s). The functionalized glycopeptides were successively modified with dansyl and naphthyl groups through the 6-oxo-Gal residue and the amino terminus of the peptide to prepare three isomeric glycopeptide probes suitable for conformation studies by fluorescence energy transfer measurements. Alternatively, glycopeptides were derivatized by attaching t-butyloxycarbonyl-L-tyrosine to the amino terminus of the peptide, and reductive amination of the 6-oxo-Gal residue, provided three isomeric triantennary photoaffinity probes which allow photolyzable groups to be attached to the newly introduced 6-amino-Gal residue."

https://openalex.org/W1590906405,"Dermal fibroblasts from a fetus with perinatal lethal OI synthesized normal and abnormal type I procollagen molecules. The abnormal molecules contained one or two pro alpha 1 (I) chains in which glycine at position 847 in the triple helical region was substituted by arginine as the result of a de novo G-to-A transition in the first base of the glycine codon. The substitution resulted in increased posttranslational modification amino-terminal of the mutation site of all chains in molecules that contained one or more abnormal chains. Secretion of the overmodified molecules was impaired, and intracellular retention of molecules which contained two abnormal chains was greater than that of molecules which contained one abnormal chain. The thermal stability of molecules that contained two abnormal chains was markedly lower than that of molecules containing one abnormal chain. After cleavage of molecules with vertebrate collagenase, the thermal stability of the overmodified A fragments was greater than that of the normal molecules. Our findings indicate that the cell distinguishes three classes of molecules and suggest that these molecules differ depending on the number of abnormal chains in the trimer."

https://openalex.org/W1483970492,"Bacteriophage P1 encodes a tripartite immunity system composed of the immC, immI, and immT region. Their basic genetic elements are the c1 repressor of lytic functions, the c4 repressor which negatively regulates antirepressor synthesis, and the bof gene, respectively. The function of the latter will be described here. We have cloned and sequenced the bof gene from P1 wild type and a P1 bof amber mutant. Based on the position of a TAG codon of the bof amber mutant the bof wild type gene was localized. It starts with a TTG codon, comprises 82 codons, and is preceded by a promoter structure. The bof protein (Mr = 7500) was overproduced in Escherichia coli from a bof recombinant plasmid and was purified to near homogeneity. The N-terminal amino acids predicted from the DNA sequence of the bof gene were confirmed by sequence analysis of the bof protein. Using a DNA mobility shift assay, we show that bof protein enhances the binding of c1 repressor to the operator of the c1 gene. In accordance with this result, in transformants of Escherichia coli, containing both a bof- and a c1-encoding plasmid, c1 expression is down-regulated. We conclude that bof acts as a modulator protein in the repression of a multitude of c1-controlled operators in the P1 genome."
https://openalex.org/W1496857754,"Human placental insulin receptor contains 47 Cys per an alpha beta dimer. Most of the 94 Cys in an intact alpha 2 beta 2 receptor are expected to form interchain or intrachain disulfide bonds, since there appears to be only one free cysteine residue in each beta subunit. In order to gain more insight into the three-dimensional organization of the insulin receptor, we have used limited trypsin digestion, SDS-PAGE, and protein microsequencing. The present study revealed the following; major tryptic cleavages occurred at alpha 164, alpha 270, alpha 582, and beta 1115, generating Mr 175,000, 130,000, 100,000, 70,000, and 55,000 disulfide-linked complexes. Under reducing conditions, tryptic fragments of Mr values = 30,000, 70,000, 20,000, 55,000, and 20,000 were identified to be alpha(1-164), alpha(165-582), alpha(165-270), alpha(271-582), and alpha(583-C-terminal), respectively. The major beta subunit tryptic fragment of Mr = 55,000 was assumed to have beta(724-1115) or beta(N-terminal-392). The Mr 175,000 complex appeared to contain two alpha(1-164) and two alpha(165-582), whereas the Mr 70,000 complex contained alpha(583-C-terminal) and beta(724-1115). Tryptic cleavage at alpha 582 apparently produced one Mr 175,000 and two Mr 70,000 complexes, suggesting that the alpha(583-C-terminal) domain interacts with the extracellular domain of the beta subunit by disulfide bonds. Tryptic cleavage at alpha 270 resulting in a formation of one Mr 100,000 complex consisting of two alpha(1-270) and two Mr 130,000 complexes consisting of alpha(271-C-terminal) and beta(724-1115) suggests that Cys residues involved with disulfide bonds between the two alpha subunits are located in the alpha(1-270) domain. The identification of the Mr 55,000 complex consisting of small tryptic fragments between alpha(122-270) indicates that 40 Cys residues in the two alpha(122-270) domains are inter- and intramolecularly associated by disulfide bonds. The alpha(1-121) domain does not appear to be linked to any other domains by disulfide bonds. These results are consistent with the structural model that the N-terminal domains of alpha subunits (122-270) are disulfide-linked together while the C-terminal domain (583-C-terminal) of the alpha subunit is linked to the N-terminal domain of the beta subunit by disulfide bonds."
https://openalex.org/W1585189722,"Escherichia coli DNA photolyase catalyzes the light-driven (300-500 nm) repair of pyrimidine dimers formed between adjacent pyrimidine bases in DNA exposed to UV light (200-300 nm). The light-driven repair process is facilitated by two enzyme-bound cofactors, FADH2 and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate. The function of the folate has been characterized in greater detail in this series of experiments. Investigations of the relative binding affinities of photolyase for the monoglutamate and polyglutamate forms of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate show that the enzyme has a greater affinity for the naturally occurring polyglutamate forms of the folate and that the exogenously added monoglutamate derivative is less tightly associated with the protein. Multiple turnover experiments reveal that the folate remains bound to photolyase even after 10 turnovers of the enzyme. Examination of the rates of repair by photolyase containing stoichiometric folate in the presence or absence of free folate under multiple turnover conditions and at micromolar concentrations of enzyme also demonstrates that the folate acts catalytically. The stimulation of turnover by exogenous folate seen at low concentrations of photolyase is shown to be due to the lower affinity of photolyase for the monoglutamate derivative used in reconstitution procedures. These results demonstrate that the folate of E. coli DNA photolyase is a bona fide cofactor and does not decompose or dissociate during multiple turnovers of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1502845247,"Two monoclonal anti-Z-DNA antibodies, Z22 and Z44, were shown to bind to the oligonucleotides, d(CG)2 and d(CG)3, and to interact with different parts of the helix. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that Fab fragments stabilize an ordered structure in the tetranucleotide d(CG)2. Nuclear Overhauser effects measured in the presence of Z22 Fab indicate a syn conformation of guanine residues of d(CG)2. Intermolecular transfer of saturation between the Fabs and bound d(CG)3 was detected by a saturation of the protein spectrum and observation of changes in the DNA spectrum. Antibodies with deuterated aromatic amino acids were prepared to eliminate the protein aromatic resonances and thereby allow a more detailed analysis of the transfer to the DNA base protons. The greatest transfer with Z44 was to the dC-5 protons although all of the base protons interact with this antibody. Little, if any, transfer to the DNA base protons was observed with Z22. These results are consistent with a Z44 binding site on the convex surface of the Z-helix (analogous to the major groove of B-DNA) and a Z22 binding site on the sugar-phosphate backbone."
https://openalex.org/W1489219079,"A synthetic peptide possessing an amino acid sequence patterned on the globular head region of human complement component 1 subcomponent q (C1q) was tested for immunoglobulin binding. The peptide designated complementary binding peptide 2 (CBP2) was able to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus Protein A and human C1q from binding rabbit immunoglobulin at peptide concentrations for 50% inhibition of 1 and 10 microM, respectively. When attached to a solid-phase matrix in a column, CBP2 was able to bind immune complexes consisting of horseradish peroxidase plus rabbit antiperoxidase antibody or alkali-aggregated human immunoglobulins. A 1:4 mixture of immune complex to free immunoglobulin when passed over the CBP2 column demonstrated selective immune complex binding. Further controls established that CBP2 was in fact binding the immunoglobulin component of the immune complexes in a reversible fashion. The immune complex specificity of the column suggested a functional affinity was forming when CBP2 interacted with immune complexes. The possibility that the sequence of CBP2 is part of the immunoglobulin binding site of human C1q is discussed."
