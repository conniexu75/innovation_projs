https://openalex.org/W1970051611,"Data from a wide variety of igneous rock types show that the ratio of potassium to uranium is approximately 1 X 10(4). This suggests that the value of K/U approximately 1 X 10(4) is characteristic of terrestrial materials and is distinct from the value of 8 X 10(4) found in chondrites. In a model earth with K/U approximately 10(4), uranium and thorium are the dominant sources of radioactive heat at the present time. This will permit the average terrestrial concentrations of uranium and thorium to be 2 to 4.7 times higher than that observed in chondrites. The resulting models of the terrestrial heat production will be considerably different from those for chondritic heat production because of the longer half-life of U(238) and Th(238) compared with K(40)."

https://openalex.org/W2002591895,Secondary ice crystals are thrown off when supercooled cloud drops are captured and freeze on a moving target in a cloud at —5°C. The rate of production of these ice crystals is proportional to the rate of accretion of drops of diameter ≥24 micrometers.

Rampart Cave, Arizona, revealed periodic occupation at intervals by the Shasta ground sloth from before 40,000 years ago until 11,000 years ago. Dates from other caves in the arid Southwest indicate that the Shasta ground sloth disappeared at very soon after the time of Clovis big game hunters. Ground sloth remains in South America are slightly younger. The timing of ground sloth extinction is in accord with the model of explosive overkill."
https://openalex.org/W2053143483,Oscillations in the ratio of two principal types of secondary calcification of the test surface in Neogloboquadrina pachyderma populations closely parallel paleoclimatic oscillations over the last 6 million years in a deep-sea core drilled in the temperate South Pacific. The nature of secondary calcification in fossil planktonic foraminifera represents a useful index in interpreting Cenozoic climates.

https://openalex.org/W2082972748,"Measurements of the electrical resistance have been made on bismuth 1 between 15 and 35 kilobars at temperatures between 77.4° and 120°K. Above about 150°K, the temperature coefficient of resistance is positive, as in a metal; below 150°K, the coefficient becomes negative, as is characteristic of semiconductors. On the basis that bismuth is a semiconductor, the energy gap, calculated by the exponential resistance formula, is 0.006 ev at 15 kb with a steady rise to 0.018 ev at 35 kb. At higher pressures, bismuth I is transformed into a metallic modification with the normal temperature dependence of the resistance. The energy gap in bismuth I is not visible at room temperature because thermal excitation populates the conduction band and metallic behavior is the result. From available evidence the observed behavior is due to an energy gap rather than to a decrease in carrier mobility."
