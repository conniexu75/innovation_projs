https://openalex.org/W4200071447,"During the transition from a healthy state to cardiometabolic disease, patients become heavily medicated, which leads to an increasingly aberrant gut microbiome and serum metabolome, and complicates biomarker discovery1-5. Here, through integrated multi-omics analyses of 2,173 European residents from the MetaCardis cohort, we show that the explanatory power of drugs for the variability in both host and gut microbiome features exceeds that of disease. We quantify inferred effects of single medications, their combinations as well as additive effects, and show that the latter shift the metabolome and microbiome towards a healthier state, exemplified in synergistic reduction in serum atherogenic lipoproteins by statins combined with aspirin, or enrichment of intestinal Roseburia by diuretic agents combined with beta-blockers. Several antibiotics exhibit a quantitative relationship between the number of courses prescribed and progression towards a microbiome state that is associated with the severity of cardiometabolic disease. We also report a relationship between cardiometabolic drug dosage, improvement in clinical markers and microbiome composition, supporting direct drug effects. Taken together, our computational framework and resulting resources enable the disentanglement of the effects of drugs and disease on host and microbiome features in multimedicated individuals. Furthermore, the robust signatures identified using our framework provide new hypotheses for drug-host-microbiome interactions in cardiometabolic disease."

Here, we show that each of the ∼1,000 olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) subtypes in the mouse harbors a distinct transcriptome whose content is precisely determined by interactions between its odorant receptor and the environment. This transcriptional variation is systematically organized to support sensory adaptation: expression levels of more than 70 genes relevant to transforming odors into spikes continuously vary across OSN subtypes, dynamically adjust to new environments over hours, and accurately predict acute OSN-specific odor responses. The sensory periphery therefore separates salient signals from predictable background via a transcriptional rheostat whose moment-to-moment state reflects the past and constrains the future; these findings suggest a general model in which structured transcriptional variation within a cell type reflects individual experience.

Sensory adaptation allows neurons and networks to minimize responses to background stimuli, thereby building more efficient neural codes that emphasize surprising or novel information (Attneave, 1954Attneave F.

Rapid (milliseconds to seconds) sensory adaptation via post-translational mechanisms occurs in most sensory neurons, and it plays an important role in shaping peripheral responses to highly dynamic stimuli (Kostal et al., 2008Kostal L.

However, it is not clear how sensory neurons adapt at the longer timescales over which animals traverse different environments—and therefore encounter different background stimuli—as is common during a typical circadian cycle. Activity-dependent transcription evolves over minutes to hours and therefore in principle could support longer-term adaptation (Yap and Greenberg, 2018Yap E.-L. Greenberg M.E. Activity-regulated transcription: Bridging the gap between neural activity and behavior.Neuron. 2018; 100: 330-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For example, mature brain neurons are thought to use the regulated transcription of synaptic proteins and ion channels to homeostatically maintain their firing rates within a narrow target range (Davis, 2006Davis G.W.

If similar transcriptional mechanisms underlie adaptation in the periphery, then sensory neurons of a given type would be expected to occupy a range of transcriptional states, with the specific state adopted by any given neuron both reflecting its prior activity history and predicting its future responses to sensory inputs (Tyssowski and Gray, 2019Tyssowski K.M. Gray J.M. The neuronal stimulation-transcription coupling map.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2019; 59: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between activity-dependent gene regulation and functional adaptation remains elusive, in part because it has not yet been shown in either peripheral or central neurons that analog changes in activity yield proportional, bidirectional, and systematic changes in the expression of genes that tune neural function (Davis, 2013Davis G.W. Homeostatic signaling and the stabilization of neural function.Neuron. 2013; 80: 718-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). There are ∼1,000 different olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) subtypes in the mouse, each of which can be identified across individuals based upon its expression of a single odorant receptor (OR) (Monahan and Lomvardas, 2015Monahan K. Lomvardas S. Monoallelic expression of olfactory receptors.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2015; 31: 721-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ORs are G protein-coupled receptors that transduce odor binding into an influx of calcium, which leads to action potentials. The expressed OR endows each OSN with a specific level of neural activity that depends on the odors present within a given environment. Although post-translational mechanisms sculpt OSN responses to rapidly fluctuating odor plumes, at longer timescales it is thought that OSNs faithfully report odor-receptor interactions to the brain. For example, OSN responses to odors (as assessed by functional imaging of OSN axons in the olfactory bulb, the first waystation for odor information in the brain) appear similar in individual mice tested at different times, across different mice, and in mice before and after training to associate a test odorant with a reward (Bozza et al., 2004Bozza T.

This homogeneity suggests that individual OSN subtypes, which vary widely in their level of activity within a given environment, do not adapt their odor responses by actively modulating gene expression. In contrast, bulk RNA and activity measurements that pool across all OSNs in mice have hinted that OSNs may use transcription to compensate for the chronic absence or presence of activity, although results and interpretations have varied across experiments (Barber and Coppola, 2015Barber C.N.

Resolving these discrepancies—and ultimately testing the hypothesis that dynamic gene expression mediates long-term adaptation in sensory neurons—requires asking how odor-evoked activity influences gene expression within particular OSN subtypes; this level of specificity is essential to clarify whether OSN transcriptomes change in an OR- and environment-specific manner; whether these changes are limited to small numbers of genes (as appears to be the case in C. elegans [Cho et al., 2016Cho C.E.

To address these questions we characterized, via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), transcriptional variation across the extraordinarily large array of identifiable OSN subtypes. Our experiments reveal that each OSN subtype expresses a distinguishable set of transcripts that is stereotyped across mice within a given environment. The main axis of transcriptional variability includes more than 70 functionally relevant genes that adaptively attenuate or amplify the transformation of odors into spikes. Furthermore, the expression of these genes varies in a continuous and coordinated manner across OSN subtypes, is modulated by specific interactions between ORs and the environment, and predicts OSN responses to new odors. Transcriptional variation among OSNs is therefore systematically organized through a rheostat-like mechanism (akin to a balance control on a stereo) whose setting in each OSN is defined by OR-environment interactions. Our findings suggest that the olfactory system uses this transcriptional rheostat to proportionally and bidirectionally adapt to persistent background odors—thereby enabling OSNs to engage in a form of sensory predictive coding—before odor information is transmitted to neural circuits responsible for perception. These data reveal that peripheral odor codes are flexible rather than fixed and support a broad model in which neurons continuously individualize their transcriptomes to facilitate functional adaptation. To assess relationships between transcription and function in the peripheral olfactory system we performed scRNA-seq on ∼770,000 mature mouse OSNs (Table S1). Our initial analysis focused on ∼40,000 mature OSNs derived from adult mice housed in a typical home cage environment; collectively, these OSNs expressed more than 1,000 ORs, with nearly every mature neuron expressing only one OR (Figures 1A and S1A–S1D). Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) embeddings of ∼1,350 highly variable genes (HVGs, here and in all analyses excluding the OR genes themselves, see STAR Methods) revealed that OSNs are partitioned into several broad subtypes related to positional identity and the expression of the lipid receptor CD36 (Figure 1B).Figure S1OSN transcriptomes are predictable across individuals, and variation is distributed across hundreds of genes, related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Histogram of the number of cells expressing each OR, from wild-type (WT) mice housed in the home cage.(B) The cumulative percent of ORs observed in OSNs (sorted by how often each OR is observed) as a function of the cumulative fraction of OSNs that express any given OR.

JSD was normalized to the maximum JSD value across all conditions. Highly variable genes (HVGs, used to compute the PCs) were selected based on their variability across OSNs expressing different ORs. Stars represent the number of HVGs used in the analyses shown in the paper. The JSD is low, and separability is at chance levels, when OR labels are shuffled. (J) Distribution of accuracies for linear classifiers predicting which OR is expressed in a given OSN, as a function of the number of OSNs expressing each OR. (K) Mean accuracy across OSN subtypes of linear classifiers predicting which OR is expressed as a function of the number of HVGs included (sorted by their informativeness, see STAR Methods). Colors indicate classification thresholds, and error bars depict the mean and SD across 10 restarts. (L) Similar to (K), but as a function of the number of genes removed. (M) (Left) Accuracy of linear classifiers predicting which OR (out of 831) is expressed, after excluding all transcription factor (TF) and axon guidance genes.

https://openalex.org/W4200457643,"Strong periodic driving with light offers the potential to coherently manipulate the properties of quantum materials on ultrafast timescales. Recently, strategies have emerged to drastically alter electronic and magnetic properties by optically inducing non-trivial band topologies1-6, emergent spin interactions7-11 and even superconductivity12. However, the prospects and methods of coherently engineering optical properties on demand are far less understood13. Here we demonstrate coherent control and giant modulation of optical nonlinearity in a van der Waals layered magnetic insulator, manganese phosphorus trisulfide (MnPS3). By driving far off-resonance from the lowest on-site manganese d-d transition, we observe a coherent on-off switching of its optical second harmonic generation efficiency on the timescale of 100 femtoseconds with no measurable dissipation. At driving electric fields of the order of 109 volts per metre, the on-off ratio exceeds 10, which is limited only by the sample damage threshold. Floquet theory calculations14 based on a single-ion model of MnPS3 are able to reproduce the measured driving field amplitude and polarization dependence of the effect. Our approach can be applied to a broad range of insulating materials and could lead to dynamically designed nonlinear optical elements."
https://openalex.org/W4200332689,"Planet formation occurs around a wide range of stellar masses and stellar system architectures1. An improved understanding of the formation process can be achieved by studying it across the full parameter space, particularly towards the extremes. Earlier studies of planets in close-in orbits around high-mass stars have revealed an increase in giant planet frequency with increasing stellar mass2 until a turnover point at 1.9 solar masses (M⊙), above which the frequency rapidly decreases3. This could potentially imply that planet formation is impeded around more massive stars, and that giant planets around stars exceeding 3 M⊙ may be rare or non-existent. However, the methods used to detect planets in small orbits are insensitive to planets in wide orbits. Here we demonstrate the existence of a planet at 560 times the Sun-Earth distance from the 6- to 10-M⊙ binary b Centauri through direct imaging. The planet-to-star mass ratio of 0.10-0.17% is similar to the Jupiter-Sun ratio, but the separation of the detected planet is about 100 times wider than that of Jupiter. Our results show that planets can reside in much more massive stellar systems than what would be expected from extrapolation of previous results. The planet is unlikely to have formed in situ through the conventional core accretion mechanism4, but might have formed elsewhere and arrived to its present location through dynamical interactions, or might have formed via gravitational instability."
https://openalex.org/W4200526578,"Antifibrotic agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis has not been developed so far. Long term treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients with antiviral drugs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and entecavir (ETV) results in the regression of liver fibrosis, but the underlying mechanism has not been clarified. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the direct impact of TDF and ETV on liver fibrosis.Activated hepatic stellate cell (HSC) cell lines were used to evaluate the effects of TDF and ETV. After treatment with each antiviral agent, cell viability, morphology, apoptotic features, autophagy and antifibrosis signalling pathways were examined. Then, collagen deposition, fibrosis markers and activated HSCs were measured in liver tissues of the liver fibrosis model mice.After TDF treatment, the viabilities of LX2 and HSC-T6 cells were decreased, and the cells exhibited apoptotic features, but ETV did not induce these effects. Cleavage of PARP and Caspase-3 and the inhibition of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-xl indicated activated HSC apoptosis following TDF treatment. TDF simultaneously increased autophagy, which also regulated apoptosis through crosstalk. TDF inactivated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, which was associated with the activation of both apoptosis and autophagy. In the liver fibrosis mouse model, the fibrotic area and activated HSC markers were decreased by TDF but not ETV treatment. Additionally, apoptotic cells were concentrated in the periportal fibrotic area after TDF treatment, which indicated the specific antifibrotic effect of TDF.TDF directly ameliorates liver fibrosis by downregulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, which results in the apoptosis of activated HSCs. The antifibrotic effects of TDF indicate that it may be a therapeutic agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4200601748,"Background After recovery from acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), many patients experience long-term symptoms in different body systems. The aim of the present study was to identify these symptoms, their severity, and their duration as a first step in building a system to classify post-recovery long-term symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods An online-based cross-sectional survey was administered between September and October 2020. Data regarding the severity of post-recovery symptoms and their duration were collected using an Arabic questionnaire divided into six categories encompassing the 20 most prevalent symptoms. Results A total of 979 patients recovered from COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia in the study period, of whom 53% were male and 47% were female. The most common symptoms included general fatigue and weakness (73% each), with moderate severity of neurological symptoms including mood changes (41%) and insomnia (39%). Among the special senses, loss of smell and taste of marked severity were reported by 64% and 55% among respiratory symptoms, cough of mild severity (47%), and dyspnea of moderate severity (43%). Loss of appetite of moderate severity was reported in 42%, and diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea of mild severity were reported by 53%, 50%, and 44% of respondents, respectively. Conclusions Long-term symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 warrant patient follow-up. The authors propose a classification system as a starting point to guide the identification and follow-up of long-term symptoms post-recovery, and recommend larger-scale studies to broaden the definition of recovery from COVID-19, which appears to have two phases, acute and chronic."

However, spatiotemporal molecular characterization of hypothalamus development in humans is largely unexplored. Here, we revealed spatiotemporal transcriptome profiles and cell-type characteristics of human hypothalamus development and illustrated the molecular diversity of neural progenitors and the cell-fate decision, which is programmed by a combination of transcription factors. Different neuronal and glial fates are sequentially produced and showed spatial developmental asynchrony. Moreover, human hypothalamic gliogenesis occurs at an earlier stage of gestation and displays distinctive transcription profiles compared with those in mouse. Notably, early oligodendrocyte cells in humans exhibit different gene patterns and interact with neuronal cells to regulate neuronal maturation by Wnt, Hippo, and integrin signals. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive molecular landscape of human hypothalamus development at early- and mid-embryonic stages and a foundation for understanding its spatial and functional complexity."

https://openalex.org/W3049743830,"Measuring the specific kind, temporal ordering, diversity, and turnover rate of stories surrounding any given subject is essential to developing a complete reckoning of that subject’s historical impact. Here, we use Twitter as a distributed news and opinion aggregation source to identify and track the dynamics of the dominant day-scale stories around Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States. Working with a data set comprising around 20 billion 1-grams, we first compare each day’s 1-gram and 2-gram usage frequencies to those of a year before, to create day- and week-scale timelines for Trump stories for 2016–2021. We measure Trump’s narrative control, the extent to which stories have been about Trump or put forward by Trump. We then quantify story turbulence and collective chronopathy—the rate at which a population’s stories for a subject seem to change over time. We show that 2017 was the most turbulent overall year for Trump. In 2020, story generation slowed dramatically during the first two major waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, with rapid turnover returning first with the Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd’s murder and then later by events leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, including the storming of the US Capitol six days into 2021. Trump story turnover for 2 months during the COVID-19 pandemic was on par with that of 3 days in September 2017. Our methods may be applied to any well-discussed phenomenon, and have potential to enable the computational aspects of journalism, history, and biography."

The study examines the prevalence and correlates of violence and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) service disruption among girls and young women during COVID-19 restrictions and lockdown.An interactive voice response survey was conducted among girls and women aged 18-24 years between 10th March to 24th April 2021. The survey enrolled 1314 participants. Descriptive analysis was used to assess prevalence of violence and SRH service disruption. Two sampled test of proportion was used to asses difference in prevalence of violence before and after the pandemic. Logistic regression was used to examine relationship between the outcome variables and socio demographic predictors.The study did not find significant difference in prevalence of violence before and after the pandemic. Education was found to be protective against experience of both physical and sexual violence after the pandemic. Dalit participants were four times more likely to report physical violence after the pandemic than Brahmin/Chhetri participants (OR:3.80; CI:1.41-10.24). Participants from 22-24-year age group were twice as likely to experience sexual violence compared to girls and participants from 18-21year age group (OR:2.25; CI:1.04-4.84). Participants from urban municipalities were 29% less likely to report SRH services disruption than participants from rural municipalities (OR-0.71, 95% CI: 0.55-0.91). Participants with disability were twice as likely to report disruption than participants without disability (OR-2.35, 95% CI: 1.45-3.82).To reduce violence against girls and women due to the pandemic, interventions should focus on Dalit women and on preventing education discontinuation among girls and women. SRH service during the pandemic needs to be improved for girls and women with focus on girls and women from rural municipalities and girls and women with disability."
https://openalex.org/W4200216969,"The cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) marker podoplanin (PDPN) is generally correlated with poor clinical outcomes in cancer patients and thus represents a promising therapeutic target. Despite its biomedical relevance, basic aspects of PDPN biology such as its cellular functions and cell surface ligands remain poorly uncharacterized, thus challenging drug development. Here, we utilize a high throughput platform to elucidate the PDPN cell surface interactome, and uncover the neutrophil protein CD177 as a new binding partner. Quantitative proteomics analysis of the CAF phosphoproteome reveals a role for PDPN in cell signaling, growth and actomyosin contractility, among other processes. Moreover, cellular assays demonstrate that CD177 is a functional antagonist, recapitulating the phenotype observed in PDPN-deficient CAFs. In sum, starting from the unbiased elucidation of the PDPN co-receptome, our work provides insights into PDPN functions and reveals the PDPN/CD177 axis as a possible modulator of fibroblast physiology in the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W4200257569,"In this retrospective analysis, we aimed to analyze the epidemic characteristics of neonatal mortality due to preterm birth at 28-36 weeks gestation in different regions from 2009 to 2018. Data were obtained from China's Under-5 Child Mortality Surveillance System (U5CMSS). The χ2 trend test, Poisson regression and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method were used in this study. We found that 51.3%, 42.0% and 44.5% of neonate deaths were preterm infants, and immaturity was mainly attributed to 60.1%, 64.1% and 69.5% of these deaths, in the eastern, central and western regions, respectively. The preterm neonatal mortality rate due to immaturity dropped from 149.2, 216.5 and 339.5 in 2009 to 47.4, 83.8 and 170.1 per 100 000 live births in 2018, giving an average annual decline rate of 12.1%, 11.6% and 6.3% in the eastern, central and western regions, respectively, during the studying period. The relative risk of preterm neonatal mortality due to immaturity were 1.3 and 2.3 for the central regions and western regions in 2009-2010, ascending to 2.2 and 3.9 in 2017-2018. The proportion of preterm neonatal deaths with a gestational age <32 weeks was highest among the eastern region. There were significantly more preterm neonatal infants who were not delivered at medical institutions in the western region than in the eastern and central regions. The preterm infant, especially with gestational age <32 weeks, should receive the most attention through enhanced policies and programs to improve child survival. Priority interventions should be region-specific, depending on the availability of economic and healthcare resources."
https://openalex.org/W4200494300,"Maintaining reproduction in highly variable, often stressful, environments is an essential challenge for all organisms. Even transient exposure to mild environmental stress may directly damage germ cells or simply tax the physiology of an individual, making it difficult to produce quality gametes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, a large fraction of germ cells acts as nurse cells, supporting developing oocytes before eventually undergoing so-called physiological germ cell apoptosis. Although C. elegans apoptosis has been extensively studied, little is known about how germline apoptosis is influenced by ecologically relevant environmental stress. Moreover, it remains unclear to what extent germline apoptosis contributes to maintaining oocyte quality, and thus offspring viability, in such conditions. Here we show that exposure to diverse environmental stressors, likely occurring in the natural C. elegans habitat (starvation, ethanol, acid, and mild oxidative stress), increases germline apoptosis, consistent with previous reports on stress-induced apoptosis. Using loss-of-function mutant alleles of ced-3 and ced-4, we demonstrate that eliminating the core apoptotic machinery strongly reduces embryonic survival when mothers are exposed to such environmental stressors during early adult life. In contrast, mutations in ced-9 and egl-1 that primarily block apoptosis in the soma but not in the germline, did not exhibit such reduced embryonic survival under environmental stress. Therefore, C. elegans germ cell apoptosis plays an essential role in maintaining offspring fitness in adverse environments. Finally, we show that ced-3 and ced-4 mutants exhibit concomitant decreases in embryo size and changes in embryo shape when mothers are exposed to environmental stress. These observations may indicate inadequate oocyte provisioning due to the absence of germ cell apoptosis. Taken together, our results show that the central genes of the apoptosis pathway play a key role in maintaining gamete quality, and thus offspring fitness, under ecologically relevant environmental conditions."

This study investigated the prognostic value of serum syndecan-1 concentration in patients with heart failure upon admission. Serum syndecan-1 concentration was analyzed in 152 patients who were hospitalized for worsening heart failure from September 2017 to June 2018. The primary outcome of the study was readmission-free survival, defined as the time from the first admission to readmission for worsened heart failure or death from any cause, which was assessed at 30 months after discharge from the hospital. The secondary outcome of the study was survival time. Blood samples and echocardiogram data were analyzed. Univariate and multivariable time-dependent Cox regression analyses adjusted for age, creatinine levels, and use of antibiotics were conducted. The serum syndecan-1 concentration was significantly associated with readmission-free survival. Subsequently, the syndecan-1 concentration may have gradually decreased with treatment. The administration of human atrial natriuretic peptide and antibiotics may have modified the relationship between readmission-free survival and serum syndecan-1 concentration (p = 0.01 and 0.008, respectively).

In this study, we aim to understand how media audiences update their trust in the government during the COVID-19 outbreak depending on the information they received. We conducted an online survey experiment in February 2020 in Hong Kong (n = 1,016) in which respondents were randomly provided with a government press release and an endorsement either from an official or a non-official source. This study shows that the information from a non-official source enhances the credibility of official government messages. Our findings imply that dictators can actually ""borrow credibility"" from their citizen journalists and even nondemocratic leaders can make themselves more trustworthy to potential dissenters through citizen journalism. Allowing information flow from non-official sources can be a practical measure for governments to address the problem of a credibility deficit during a pandemic."

Hazard ratios (HR) were assessed using Cox regression to investigate the association between AKI, 30-days mortality and renal function decline up to 1 year after AKI. Survival in patients with and without AKI was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses.Of the 3105 patients in the SPACE-cohort, we included 1716 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 10.8% had an AKI episode. Mortality was 12.4% for the AKI group and 4.2% for the non-AKI patients. The adjusted HR for all-cause mortality at 30-days in AKI patients was 2.8 (95% CI 1.7-4.8). Moreover, the cumulative incidence of renal function decline was 69.8% for AKI patients and 39.3% for non-AKI patients. Patients with an episode of AKI had higher risk of developing renal function decline (adjusted HR 3.3, 95% CI 2.4-4.5) at one year after initial AKI-episode at the emergency department.Acute kidney injury is common in patients with suspected infection in the emergency department and is significantly associated with 30-days mortality and renal function decline one year after AKI."

Neurologists´ behavioral characteristics have been associated with suboptimal clinical decisions. However, limited information is available on their impact among NPs involved in MS care. The aim of this study was to assess nurses´ therapeutic choices to understand behavioral factors influencing their decision making process.A non-interventional, cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted. NPs actively involved in the care of patients with MS were invited to participate in the study by the Spanish Society of Neurology Nursing. Participants answered questions regarding their standard practice and therapeutic management of seven simulated relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) case scenarios. A behavioral battery was used to measure participants´ life satisfaction, mood, positive social behaviors, feeling of helpfulness, attitudes toward adoption of evidence-based innovations, occupational burnout, and healthcare-related regret. The outcome of interest was therapeutic inertia (TI), defined as the lack of treatment escalation when there is clinical and radiological evidence of disease activity. A score to quantify TI was created based on the number of simulated scenarios where treatment intensification was warranted.Overall, 331 NPs were invited to participate, 130 initiated the study, and 96 (29%) completed the study. The mean age (SD) was 44.6 (9.8) years and 91.7% were female. Seventy-three participants (76.0%) felt their opinions had a significant influence on neurologists´ therapeutic decisions. Sixteen NPs (16.5%) showed severe emotional exhaustion related to work and 13 (13.5%) had depressive symptoms. The mean (SD) TI score was 0.97 (1.1). Fifty-six of NPs showed TI in at least one case scenario. Higher years of nursing experience (p = 0.014), feeling of helpfulness (p = 0.014), positive attitudes toward innovations (p = 0.046), and a higher intensity of care-related regret (p = 0.021) were associated with a lower risk of TI (adjusted R2 = 0.28). Burnout was associated with higher risk of TI (p = 0.001).Although NPs cannot prescribe MS treatments in Spain, their behavioral characteristics may influence the management of patients with RRMS. Continuing education and specific strategies for reducing occupational burnout may lead to better management skills and improve MS care."

Extended cytoreduction (ECR) was defined as surgery involving the bowel, liver, diaphragm, bladder, stomach, or spleen. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to analyze patient and hospital demographics related to ECR, and trends were assessed using the Cochran-Armitage test.Of the estimated 79,400 patients undergoing ovarian cancer surgery, 22% received ECR. Decreased adjusted odds of ECR were found in patients with lower Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) scores (OR 0.61, p<0.001 for ECI 2, versus ECI≥3) or residence outside the top income quartile (OR 0.71, p<0.001 for Q1, versus Q4), and increased odds were seen at hospitals with high ovarian cancer surgical volume (OR 1.25, p<0.001, versus low volume). From 2013 to 2017, there was a decrease in the proportion of cases with extended procedures (19% to 15%, p<0.001). There were significant decreases in the proportion of cases with small bowel, colon, and rectosigmoid resections (p<0.001).

We evaluated the contribution of several known lifestyle co-risk factors for cervical cancer among black South African women.We used participant data from the Johannesburg Cancer Study, a case-control study of women recruited mainly at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital between 1995 and 2016. A total of 3,450 women in the study had invasive cervical cancers, 95% of which were squamous cell carcinoma. Controls were 5,709 women with cancers unrelated to exposures of interest. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORadj) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We ranked these risk factors by their population attributable fractions (PAF), which take the local prevalence of exposure among the cases and risk into account.Cervical cancer in decreasing order of priority was associated with (1) being HIV positive (ORadj = 2.83, 95% CI = 2.53-3.14, PAF = 17.6%), (2) lower educational attainment (ORadj = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.44-1.77, PAF = 16.2%), (3) higher parity (3+ children vs 2-1 children (ORadj = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.07-1.46, PAF = 12.6%), (4) hormonal contraceptive use (ORadj = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.24-1.77, PAF = 8.9%), (5) heavy alcohol consumption (ORadj = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.15-1.81, PAF = 5.6%), (6) current smoking (ORadj = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.41-1.91, PAF = 5.1%), and (7) rural residence (ORadj = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.44-1.77, PAF = 4.4%).This rank order of risks could be used to target educational messaging and appropriate interventions for cervical cancer prevention in South African women."

The main reasons for their extensive use are their plasticity and multiple applications, including in regenerative medicine and the screening of new drugs. The aim of this study was to better understand these structures by focusing on the choice of the best housekeeping gene (HKG) to perform accurate molecular analysis on such a heterogeneous system. This feature should not be underestimated because the inappropriate use of a HKG can lead to misleading data and incorrect results, especially when the subject of the study is innovative and not totally explored like organoids. We focused our attention on the newly described human pancreatic organoids (hPOs) and compared 12 well-known HKGs (ACTB, B2M, EF1α, GAPDH, GUSB, HPRT, PPIA, RNA18S, RPL13A TBP, UBC and YWHAZ). Four different statistical algorithms (NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper and ΔCt) were applied to estimate the expression stability of each HKG, and RefFinder was used to identify the most suitable genes for RT-qPCR data normalization. Our results showed that the intragroup and intergroup comparisons could influence the best choice of the HKG, making clear that the identification of a stable reference gene for accurate and reproducible RT-qPCR data normalization remains a critical issue. In summary, this is the first report on HKGs in human organoids, and this work provides a strong basis to pave the way for further gene analysis in hPOs."

To assess the implementation rate and barriers to cardiac rehabilitation in hospitals dealing with acute myocardial infarction in South Korea, between May and July 2016, questionnaires were emailed to cardiology directors of 93 hospitals in South Korea; all hospitals were certified institutes for coronary interventions. The questionnaires included 16 questions on the hospital type, cardiology practice, and implementation of cardiac rehabilitation. The obtained data were categorized into two groups based on the type of the hospital (secondary or tertiary) and statistically analysed. Of the 72 hospitals that responded (response rate of 77%), 39 (54%) were tertiary medical centers and 33 (46%) were secondary medical centers. All hospitals treated acute myocardial infarction patients and performed emergency percutaneous coronary intervention; 79% (57/72) of the hospitals performed coronary artery bypass grafting.

The treatment lasted for 12 weeks.HFD caused increased food intake, body weight, insulin level, insulin resistance and plasma and liver lipid but decreased adipose lipid. In addition, HFD also increased plasma, adipose and liver malondialdehyde, IL-6, uric acid and decreased Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione, nitric oxide and circulating obestatin concentration. However, these deleterious effects except food intake were attenuated when supplemented with melatonin.Taken together, the present results indicate that HFD exposure causes adipose-hepatic metabolic disturbance in obese animals, which are accompanied by oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, the present results suggest that melatonin supplementation attenuates adipose-hepatic metabolic dysfunction, accompanying obesity by suppression of oxidative stress/inflammation-dependent mechanism and increasing circulating obestatin."

Auditory brainstem response (ABRs) measured from 2 to 20 kHz at baseline and 21 days post-noise. Samples were then collected for serum (SOD, CAT, GR, GPx) and cochlear (GSH, GSSG) antioxidant levels.Ten Chinchillas per group.Preloading D-met significantly reduced ABR threshold shifts for both impulse and steady state noise exposures but with different optimal starting time points and with differences in antioxidant measures. For impulse noise exposure, the 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 day preloading start provide significant threshold shift protection at all frequencies. Compared to the saline controls, serum GR for the 3.0 and 3.5 day preloading groups was significantly increased at 21 days with no significant increase in SOD, CAT or GPx for any impulse preloading time point. Cochlear GSH, GSSG, and GSH/GSSG ratio were not significantly different from saline controls at 21 days post noise exposure. For steady state noise exposure, significant threshold shift protection occurred at all frequencies for the 3.5, 3.0 and 2.5 day preloading start times but protection only occurred at 3 of the 6 test frequencies for the 2.0 day preloading start point. Compared to the saline controls, preloaded D-met steady-state noise groups demonstrated significantly higher serum SOD for the 2.5-3.5 day starting time points and GPx for the 2.5 day starting time but no significant increase in GR or CAT for any preloading time point. Compared to saline controls, D-met significantly increased cochlear GSH concentrations in the 2 and 2.5 day steady-state noise exposed groups but no significant differences in GSSG or the GSH/GSSG ratio were noted for any steady state noise-exposed group.The optimal D-met preloading starting time window is earlier for steady state (3.5-2.5 days) than impulse noise (3.0-2.0). At 21 days post impulse noise, D-met increased serum GR for 2 preloading time points but not SOD, CAT, or GpX and not cochlear GSH, GSSG or the GSH/GSSG ratio. At 21 days post steady state noise D-met increased serum SOD and GPx at select preloading time points but not CAT or GR. However D-met did increase the cochlear GSH at select preloading time points but not GSSG or the GSH/GSSG ratio."
https://openalex.org/W4205947422,"Public procurement refers to the purchase by public sector entities—such as government departments or local authorities—of Services, Goods, or Works. It accounts for a significant share of OECD countries’ expenditures. However, while governments are expected to execute them as efficiently as possible, there is a lack of methodologies for an adequate comparison of procurement activity between institutions at different scales, which represents a challenge for policymakers and academics. Here, we propose using methods borrowed from urban scaling laws literature to study public procurement activity among 278 Portuguese municipalities between 2011 and 2018. We find that public procurement expenditure scales sublinearly with population size, indicating an economy of scale for public spending as cities increase their population size. Moreover, when looking at the municipal Scale-Adjusted Indicators (the deviations from the scaling law) by contract categories—Works, Goods, and Services—we are able to identify a richer local characterisation of municipalities based on the similarity of procurement activity. These results make up a framework for quantitatively studying local public expenditure by enabling policymakers a more appropriate foundation for comparative analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4206394398,"Many areas of the United States have air pollution levels typically below Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory limits. Most health effects studies of air pollution use meteorological (e.g., warm/cool) or astronomical (e.g., solstice/equinox) definitions of seasons despite evidence suggesting temporally-misaligned intra-annual periods of relative asthma burden (i.e., ""asthma seasons""). We introduce asthma seasons to elucidate whether air pollutants are associated with seasonal differences in asthma emergency department (ED) visits in a low air pollution environment. Within a Bayesian time-stratified case-crossover framework, we quantify seasonal associations between highly resolved estimates of six criteria air pollutants, two weather variables, and asthma ED visits among 66,092 children ages 5-19 living in South Carolina (SC) census tracts from 2005 to 2014. Results show that coarse particulates (particulate matter <10 μm and >2.5 μm: PM10-2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) may contribute to asthma ED visits across years, but are particularly implicated in the highest-burden fall asthma season. Fine particulate matter (<2.5 μm: PM2.5) is only associated in the lowest-burden summer asthma season. Relatively cool and dry conditions in the summer asthma season and increased temperatures in the spring and fall asthma seasons are associated with increased ED visit odds. Few significant associations in the medium-burden winter and medium-high-burden spring asthma seasons suggest other ED visit drivers (e.g., viral infections) for each, respectively. Across rural and urban areas characterized by generally low air pollution levels, there are acute health effects associated with particulate matter, but only in the summer and fall asthma seasons and differing by PM size."

Openness to collaboration was also considered as an enabler for community stakeholders' engagement. The lack of recognition of community-based organisations by certain providers and the time required to participate in individualized service plans were outlined as barriers to professional integration. Limited opportunities for community stakeholders to be involved in decision-making within case management programs were reported as another constraint to their engagement. Cultural differences between organisations regarding the focus of the intervention (psychosocial vs healthcare needs) and differences in bureaucratic structures and funding mechanisms may negatively affect community stakeholders' engagement. Formal consultation mechanisms and improvement of communication channels between healthcare providers and community stakeholders were suggested as ways to overcome these barriers.Efforts to improve care integration in case management programs should be directed toward the recognition of community stakeholders as co-producers of care and co-builders of social policies across the entire care continuum for people with complex needs."

https://openalex.org/W4200203848,"The core implication of nursing professionals' labor is promoting self-care and foster well-being among healthcare service users. The beginning of the healing process starts with the provider, and self-care habits are needed to positively impact on patients' care outcomes at different spheres. Overall, current literature supports the idea that nurses' personal self-care should be a necessary skill to be expected in their professional role. In this regard, the Appraisal of Self-care Agency Scale (ASAS) is a worldwide known instrument aimed at assessing the ability to engage in self-care. However, it has never been tested in the Spanish context before, and much less in nursing practitioners or apprentices. The aim of this study was to translate, adapt and validate the ASAS for Spanish nursing apprentices, assessing its dimensionality, psychometric properties and convergent validity by means of the Sense of Coherence (SOC-13) questionnaire.Data were collected from a random sample of 921 Certificated Nursing Assistant (CNA) Spanish students and was analyzed trough confirmatory factor analyses via structural equation models. The core ASAS construct and its subscales were correlated with the SOC-13 scores.Fair psychometric properties for the questionnaire were set. Also, SEM models endorse the validity and reliability of the four-factor dimensionality of the Spanish adaptation of the ASAS, whose associations to SOC scores were coherent and significant.This study allowed to establish that the Spanish version of the ASAS might be a useful tool for addressing self-care-related issues among nursing apprentices, a key population for promoting both their own and patients' health and welfare through healthy and care-related behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W4200354940,"Movement adapts during acute pain. This is assumed to reduce nociceptive input, but the interpretation may not be straightforward. We investigated whether movement adaptation during pain reflects a purposeful search for a less painful solution. Three groups of participants performed two blocks (Baseline, Experimental) of wrist movements in the radial-ulnar direction. For the Control group (n = 10) both blocks were painfree. In two groups, painful electrical stimulation was applied at the elbow in Experimental conditions when the wrist crossed radial-ulnar neutral. Different stimulus intensities were given for specific wrist angles in a secondary direction (flexion-extension) as the wrist passed radial-ulnar neutral (Pain 5-1 group:painful stimulation at ~5 or ~1/10-n = 21; Pain 5-0 group:~5 or 0(no stimulation)/10-n = 6)). Participants were not informed about the less painful alternative and could use any strategy. We recorded the percentage of movements using the wrist flexion/extension alignment that evoked the lower intensity noxious stimulus, movement variability, and change in wrist/forearm alignment during pain. Participants adapted their strategy of wrist movement during pain provocation and reported less pain over time. Three adaptations of wrist movement were observed; (i) greater use of the wrist alignment with no/less noxious input (Pain 5-1, n = 8/21; Pain 5-0, n = 2/6); (ii) small (n = 9/21; n = 3/6) or (iii) large (n = 4/21; n = 1/6) change of wrist/forearm alignment to a region that was not allocated to provide an actual reduction in noxious stimulus. Pain reduction was achieved with ""taking action"" to relieve pain and did not depend on reduced noxious stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W4200471271,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) results, in part, from the interaction of metabolic derangements with predisposing genetic variants, leading to liver-related complications and mortality. The strongest genetic determinant is a highly prevalent missense variant in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3 p.I148M). In human liver hepatocytes PNPLA3 localizes to the surface of lipid droplets where the mutant form is believed to enhance lipid accumulation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Less is known about the role of PNPLA3 in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Here we characterized HSC obtained from patients carrying the wild type (n = 8 C/C) and the heterozygous (n = 6, C/G) or homozygous (n = 6, G/G) PNPLA3 I148M and investigated the effect of genotype and PNPLA3 downregulation on baseline and TGF-β-stimulated fibrotic gene expression. HSCs from all genotypes showed comparable baseline levels of PNPLA3 and expression of the fibrotic genes α-SMA, COL1A1, TIMP1 and SMAD7. Treatment with TGF-β increased PNPLA3 expression in all 3 genotypes (~2-fold) and resulted in similar stimulation of the expression of several fibrogenic genes. In primary human HSCs carrying wild-type (WT) PNPLA3, siRNA treatment reduced PNPLA3 mRNA by 79% resulting in increased expression of α-SMA, Col1a1, TIMP1, and SMAD7 in cells stimulated with TGF-β. Similarly, knock-down of PNPLA3 in HSCs carrying either C/G or G/G genotypes resulted in potentiation of TGF-β induced expression of fibrotic genes. Knockdown of PNPLA3 did not impact fibrotic gene expression in the absence of TGF-β treatment. Together, these data indicate that the presence of the I148M PNPLA3 mutation in HSC has no effect on baseline activation and that downregulation of PNPLA3 exacerbates the fibrotic response irrespective of the genotype."
https://openalex.org/W4226154608,"Fertilization in mammals begins with the union of egg and sperm, an event that starts a cascade of cellular processes. The molecular-level understanding of these processes can guide the development of new strategies for controlling and/or promoting fertilization, and inform researchers and medical professional on the best choice of interventions. The proteins encoded by the IZUMO1 and JUNO genes form a ligand-receptor protein pair involved in the recognition of sperm and egg. Due to their role in the fertilization process, these proteins are potential targets for the development of novel anti-contraceptive, as well as infertility treatments. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of these gene sequences, with the objective of identifying evolutionary patterns that may support their relevance as targets for preventing or improving fertility among humans. JUNO and IZUMO1 gene sequences were identified within the genomes of over 2,000 humans sequenced in the 1000 Genomes Project. The human sequences were subjected to analyses of nucleotide diversity, deviation from neutrality of genetic variation, population-based differentiation (FST), haplotype inference, and whole chromosome scanning for signals of positive or of balancing selection. Derived alleles were determined by comparison to archaic hominin and other primate genomes. The potential effect of common non-synonymous variants on protein-protein interaction was also assessed. IZUMO1 displays higher variability among human individuals than JUNO. Genetic differentiation between continental population pairs was within whole-genome estimates for all but the JUNO gene in the African population group with respect to the other 4 population groups (American, East Asian, South Asian, and European). Tajima's D values demonstrated deviation from neutrality for both genes in comparison to a group of genes identified in the literature as under balancing or positive selection. Tajima's D for IZUMO1 aligns with values calculated for genes presumed to be under balancing selection, whereas JUNO's value aligned with genes presumed to be under positive selection. These inferences on selection are both supported by SNP density, nucleotide diversity and haplotype analysis. A JUNO haplotype carrying 3 derived alleles out of 5, one of which is a missense mutation implicated in polyspermy, was found to be significant in a population of African ancestry. Polyspermy has a disadvantageous impact on fertility and its presence in approximately 30% of the population of African ancestry may be associated to a potentially beneficial role of this haplotype. This role has not been established and may be related to a non-reproductive role of JUNO. The high degree of conservation of the JUNO sequence combined with a dominant haplotype across multiple population groups supports JUNO as a potential target for the development of contraceptive treatments. In addition to providing a detailed account of human genetic diversity across these 2 important and related genes, this study also provides a framework for large population-based studies investigating protein-protein interactions at the genome level."
https://openalex.org/W4200007288,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common solid tumor in children. NB treatment has made significant progress; however, given the high degree of heterogeneity, basic research findings and their clinical application to NB still face challenges. Herein, we identify novel prognostic models for NB.We obtained RNA expression data of NB and normal nervous tissue from TARGET and GTEx databases and determined the differential expression patterns of RNA binding protein (RBP) genes between normal and cancerous tissues. Lasso regression and Cox regression analyses identified the five most important differentially expressed genes and were used to construct a new prognostic model. The function and prognostic value of these RBPs were systematically studied and the predictive accuracy verified in an independent dataset.In total, 348 differentially expressed RBPs were identified. Of these, 166 were up-regulated and 182 down-regulated RBPs. Two hubs RBPs (CPEB3 and CTU1) were identified as prognostic-related genes and were chosen to build the prognostic risk score models. Multivariate Cox analysis was performed on genes from univariate Cox regression and Lasso regression analysis using proportional hazards regression model. A five gene prognostic model: Risk score = (-0.60901*expCPEB3)+(0.851637*expCTU1) was built. Based on this model, the overall survival of patients in the high-risk subgroup was lower (P = 2.152e-04). The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator characteristic curve of the prognostic model was 0.720 in the TARGET cohort. There were significant differences in the survival rate of patients in the high and low-risk subgroups in the validation data set GSE85047 (P = 0.1237e-08), with the AUC 0.730. The risk model was also regarded as an independent predictor of prognosis (HR = 1.535, 95% CI = 1.368-1.722, P = 2.69E-13).This study identified a potential risk model for prognosis in NB using Cox regression analysis. RNA binding proteins (CPEB3 and CTU1) can be used as molecular markers of NB."

We collect data on 204 serial acquirers in four high tech industries, and use March’s explore-exploit framework, to classify these firms’ 1,415 acquisitions. We then distinguish, for example, exploration-based acquisitions, conducted after a series of exploitation-based acquisitions. Our results suggest that the market takes a portfolio perspective when reacting to an acquisition. In support of the ambidexterity literature, we show that the market responds positively to a switch from one type of strategy to another. Zooming in on the direction of the shift, we find that the market responds more positively to a switch towards exploration after exploitation, compared with the alternative. In so doing, we contribute to the literature on acquisition motives, by showing that prior announcements matter in explaining market reactions, and we contribute to the literature on ambidexterity, by showing that the market favours firms that oscillate between exploration and exploitation."
https://openalex.org/W4200099384,"Accurate and reliable state estimation and mapping are the foundation of most autonomous driving systems. In recent years, researchers have focused on pose estimation through geometric feature matching. However, most of the works in the literature assume a static scenario. Moreover, a registration based on a geometric feature is vulnerable to the interference of a dynamic object, resulting in a decline of accuracy. With the development of a deep semantic segmentation network, we can conveniently obtain the semantic information from the point cloud in addition to geometric information. Semantic features can be used as an accessory to geometric features that can improve the performance of odometry and loop closure detection. In a more realistic environment, semantic information can filter out dynamic objects in the data, such as pedestrians and vehicles, which lead to information redundancy in generated map and map-based localization failure. In this paper, we propose a method called LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO) with loop closure combined with semantic information (LIO-CSI), which integrates semantic information to facilitate the front-end process as well as loop closure detection. First, we made a local optimization on the semantic labels provided by the Sparse Point-Voxel Neural Architecture Search (SPVNAS) network. The optimized semantic information is combined into the front-end process of tightly-coupled light detection and ranging (LiDAR) inertial odometry via smoothing and mapping (LIO-SAM), which allows us to filter dynamic objects and improve the accuracy of the point cloud registration. Then, we proposed a semantic assisted scan-context method to improve the accuracy and robustness of loop closure detection. The experiments were conducted on an extensively used dataset KITTI and a self-collected dataset on the Jilin University (JLU) campus. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is better than the purely geometric method, especially in dynamic scenarios, and it has a good generalization ability."
https://openalex.org/W4200364066,"With the spread of COVID-19, significant concerns have been raised about the potential increased risk for electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) users for COVID-19 infection and related syndromes. Social media is an increasingly popular source for health information dissemination and discussion, and can affect health outcomes.This study aims to identify the topics in the public vaping discussion in COVID-19-related Twitter posts in order to get insight into public vaping-related perceptions, attitudes and concerns, and to discern possible misinformation and misconceptions around vaping in the COVID-19 pandemic.Using the tweets ID database maintained by Georgia State University's Panacea Lab, we downloaded the tweets related to COVID-19 from March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to February 12, 2021. We used R to analyze the tweets that contained a list of 79 keywords related to vaping. After removing duplicates and tweets created by faked accounts or bots, the final data set consisted of 11,337 unique tweets from 7,710 different users. We performed the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modeling and carried out a sentiment analysis.Despite fluctuations, the number of daily tweets was relatively stable (average number of daily tweets = 33.4) with a sole conspicuous spike happening on a few days after August 11, 2020 when a research team published findings that teenagers and young adults who vape face a much higher risk of COVID-19 infection than their peers who do not vape. Topic modeling generated 8 topics: linkage between vaping and risk of COVID-19 infection, vaping pneumonia and the origin of COVID-19, vaping and spread of COVID-19, vaping regulation, calling for quitting vaping, protecting youth, similarity between e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI) and COVID-19, and sales information. Daily sentiment scores showed that the public sentiment was predominantly negative, but became slightly more positive over the course of the study time period.While some content in the public discourse on vaping before the COVID-19 pandemic continued in Twitter posts during the COVID-19 time period, new topics emerged. We found a substantial amount of anti-vaping discussion and dominantly negative sentiment around vaping during COVID-19, a sharp contrast to the predominantly pro-vaping voice on social media in the pre-COVID-19 period. Continued monitoring of social media conversations around vaping is needed, and the public health community may consider using social media platforms to actively convey scientific information around vaping and vaping cessation."

It is unclear whether LV is correlated with age; however, it is known that liver function decreases with age. In addition, the gender-related role of LV remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the changes in LV by age and gender. Between January and December 2018, 374 consecutive patients who underwent abdominal multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for any abdominal examinations were enrolled. LV was evaluated using MDCT. The relationship between the LV and body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), age, and gender was investigated. The modified LV (mLV) was calculated by a formula measured LV × 1.5/BSA. LV correlated to BSA more than to BMI in both the males (R: 0.559 vs. 0.416) and females (R: 0.479 vs. 0.300) in our study. Age was negatively correlated to LV and BSA, and correlated to LV more than to BSA in males (R: 0.546 vs. 0.393) and females (R: 0.506 vs. 0.385). In addition, the absolute slope between age and LV in the males was higher than that in the females (14.1 vs. 10.2, respectively). Furthermore, the absolute slope of age and mLV in the males was slightly higher than in the females (9.1 vs. 7.3, respectively). In conclusion, LV in the normal liver is correlated to age rather than the one in the diseased liver. Liver volume in the males decreased more with age than LV in the females."

Effacement of interdigitating podocyte foot processes in the glomeruli causes a leaky filtration barrier resulting in proteinuria followed by the development of chronic kidney diseases. Since the function of the filtration barrier is depending on a proper actin cytoskeleton, we studied the role of the important actin-binding protein palladin for podocyte morphology. Podocyte-specific palladin knockout mice on a C57BL/6 genetic background (PodoPalldBL/6-/-) were back crossed to a 129 genetic background (PodoPalld129-/-) which is known to be more sensitive to kidney damage. Then we analyzed the morphological changes of glomeruli and podocytes as well as the expression of the palladin-binding partners Pdlim2, Lasp-1, Amotl1, ezrin and VASP in 6 and 12 months old mice. PodoPalld129-/- mice in 6 and 12 months showed a marked dilatation of the glomerular tuft and a reduced expression of the mesangial marker protein integrin α8 compared to controls of the same age. Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis showed significantly more podocytes with morphological deviations like an enlarged sub-podocyte space and regions with close contact to parietal epithelial cells. Moreover, PodoPalld129-/- of both age showed a severe effacement of podocyte foot processes, a significantly reduced expression of pLasp-1 and Pdlim2, and significantly reduced mRNA expression of Pdlim2 and VASP, three palladin-interacting proteins. Taken together, the results show that palladin is essential for proper podocyte morphology in mice with a 129 background."
https://openalex.org/W4200567196,"Enhancers regulate transcription of target genes, causing a change in expression level. Thus, the aberrant activity of enhancers can lead to diseases. To date, a large number of enhancers have been identified, yet a small portion of them have been found to be associated with diseases. This raises a pressing need to develop computational methods to predict associations between diseases and enhancers.In this study, we assumed that enhancers sharing target genes could be associated with similar diseases to predict the association. Thus, we built an enhancer functional interaction network by connecting enhancers significantly sharing target genes, then developed a network diffusion method RWDisEnh, based on a random walk with restart algorithm, on networks of diseases and enhancers to globally measure the degree of the association between diseases and enhancers. RWDisEnh performed best when the disease similarities are integrated with the enhancer functional interaction network by known disease-enhancer associations in the form of a heterogeneous network of diseases and enhancers. It was also superior to another network diffusion method, i.e., PageRank with Priors, and a neighborhood-based one, i.e., MaxLink, which simply chooses the closest neighbors of known disease-associated enhancers. Finally, we showed that RWDisEnh could predict novel enhancers, which are either directly or indirectly associated with diseases.Taken together, RWDisEnh could be a potential method for predicting disease-enhancer associations."
https://openalex.org/W4200088270,"Consumers often make decisions that reflect either personal or social identities. In many cases, such decisions are made along a sequence. Our research introduces a central factor that influences consumers' likelihood of expressing a consistent identity type along a sequence of decisions: the extent to which their usage of the product involved in the first decision is expected to be observable by others (the product's expected visibility). A field experiment, and four lab studies, coupled with an internal meta-analysis, show that when the product involved in the first decision has high (as opposed to low) expected visibility, consumers are more likely to make a subsequent decision that is consistent with the first. Results show that self-presentation mediates this effect, and suggest that low integration between the identities involved in the decisions might attenuate it. Our findings offer implications for identity research and practical implications for marketers seeking to develop products and design communications that encourage consistent (or inconsistent) behavior."

Daily clinical and biochemical parameters of the patients were prospectively assessed with a follow-up of 14 days after discharge. A magnetic bead-based multiplex cytokine kit was used to detect 17 cytokines.Of the 142 clinically suspected leptospirosis patients recruited, 47 were confirmed and, 29 cases were labeled as ""probable."" Thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis were observed at least once during the hospital stay among 76(54%) and 39(28%) patients, respectively. Acute kidney injury was observed in 31 patients (22%) and it was significantly higher among confirmed and probable cases. Hu TNF-α and IL-1β were detected only in patients without complications. Hu MIP-1b levels were significantly higher among patients with complications. During the convalescence period, all tested serum cytokine levels were lower compared to the acute sample, except for IL-8. The cytokine response during the acute phase clustered in four different groups. High serum creatinine was associated GM-CSF, high IL-5 and IL-6 level were correlates with lung involvement and saturation drop. The patients with high billirubin (direct)>7 mmol/l had high IL-13 levels.Results of this study confirms that the knowledge on cytokine response in leptospirosis could be more complex than other similar tropical disease, and biosignatures that provide diagnostic and prognostic information for human leptospirosis remain to be discovered."

Primary outcomes were period prevalence and mothers' quantity of health care utilization (primary, inpatient, outpatient, surgical, and psychiatric services) stratified by their child's age (i.e., ages 0-6 = before school, ages 7-13 = pre-school + primary education, and ages 14-18 = secondary education or higher). The secondary outcome measure was length of hospital stays. Outcome measures were adjusted for maternal age at delivery, parity, marital status, income quartile, level of education in the year prior to the index birth, previous spontaneous abortions, maternal pregnancy complications, maternal diabetes, hypertension, alcohol-related diseases, and maternal smoking.In both cohorts the majority of mothers were between 26 and 35 years of age, married, and employed, and 47% were primiparous. Mothers of infants with anomalies had greater utilization of outpatient, inpatient, surgical, and psychiatric services, compared with mothers in the matched cohort. Inpatient service utilization was greater in the exposed cohort up to 13 years after a child's birth, with the highest risk in the first six years after birth [adjusted risk ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-1.14], with a decrease over time. Regarding the quantity of health care utilization, the greatest difference between the two groups was in inpatient service utilization, with a 39% increased rate in the exposed cohort during the first six years after birth (adjusted rate ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.37-1.42). During the first 6 years after birth, mothers of children with anomalies stayed a median of 6 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3-13) in hospital overall, while the comparison cohort stayed a median of 4 days (IQR, 2-7) in hospital overall. Rates of utilization of outpatient clinics (adjusted rate ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.29-1.42), as well as inpatient (adjusted rate ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.68-1.87), and surgical services (adjusted rate ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.26-1.41) was higher in mothers of children with multiple-organ MCAs during 0 to 6 years after birth. Among mothers at the lowest income levels, utilization of psychiatric clinic services increased to 59% and when their child was 7 to 13 years of age (adjusted rate ratio, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.24-2.03).Mothers of infants with a major congenital anomaly had greater health care utilization across services. Health care utilization decreased over time or remained stable for outpatient, inpatient, and surgical care services, whereas psychiatric utilization increased for up to 13 years after an affected child's birth. Healthcare utilization was significantly elevated among mothers of children with multiple MCAs and among those at the lowest income levels."
https://openalex.org/W4200504994,"This study aims to solve the overfitting problem caused by insufficient labeled images in the automatic image annotation field. We propose a transfer learning model called CNN-2L that incorporates the label localization strategy described in this study. The model consists of an InceptionV3 network pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and a label localization algorithm. First, the pretrained InceptionV3 network extracts features from the target dataset that are used to train a specific classifier and fine-tune the entire network to obtain an optimal model. Then, the obtained model is used to derive the probabilities of the predicted labels. For this purpose, we introduce a squeeze and excitation (SE) module into the network architecture that augments the useful feature information, inhibits useless feature information, and conducts feature reweighting. Next, we perform label localization to obtain the label probabilities and determine the final label set for each image. During this process, the number of labels must be determined. The optimal K value is obtained experimentally and used to determine the number of predicted labels, thereby solving the empty label set problem that occurs when the predicted label values of images are below a fixed threshold. Experiments on the Corel5k multilabel image dataset verify that CNN-2L improves the labeling precision by 18% and 15% compared with the traditional multiple-Bernoulli relevance model (MBRM) and joint equal contribution (JEC) algorithms, respectively, and it improves the recall by 6% compared with JEC. Additionally, it improves the precision by 20% and 11% compared with the deep learning methods Weight-KNN and adaptive hypergraph learning (AHL), respectively. Although CNN-2L fails to improve the recall compared with the semantic extension model (SEM), it improves the comprehensive index of the F1 value by 1%. The experimental results reveal that the proposed transfer learning model based on a label localization strategy is effective for automatic image annotation and substantially boosts the multilabel image annotation performance."
https://openalex.org/W4200558157,"Subclinical stage of ehrlichiosis is characterized by absence of clinical or laboratory alterations; however, it could lead to silent glomerular/tubular changes and contribute significantly to renal failure in humans and animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate glomerular and tubular alterations in dogs with subclinical ehrlichiosis. We evaluated renal biopsies of 14 bitches with subclinical ehrlichiosis and 11 control dogs. Samples were obtained from the left kidney, and the tissue obtained was divided for light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy. Abnormalities were identified by light microscopy in 92.9% of dogs with ehrlichiosis, but not in any of the dogs of the control group. Mesangial cell proliferation and synechiae (46.1%) were the most common findings, but focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and ischemic glomeruli (38.4%), focal glomerular mesangial matrix expansion (30.7%), mild to moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (23%), and glomerular basement membrane spikes (23%) were also frequent in dogs with ehrlichiosis. All animals with ehrlichiosis exhibited positive immunofluorescence staining for immunoglobulins. Transmission electron microscopy from dogs with ehrlichiosis revealed slight changes such as sparse surface projections and basement membrane double contour. The subclinical phase of ehrlichiosis poses a higher risk of development of kidney damage due to the deposition of immune complexes."
https://openalex.org/W4200566895,"Objectives To examine the relation between physical and psychological health indicators at adolescence (age 18) and household, personal, and nursing home care use later in life at ages 57–69 years. Methods Using medical examinations on men born in 1944–1947 who were evaluated for military service at age 18 in the Netherlands, we link physical and psychological health assessments to national administrative microdata on the use of home care services at ages 57–69 years. We postulate a panel probit model for home care use over these years. In the analyses, we account for selective survival through correlated panel probit models. Results Poor mental health and being overweight at age 18 are important predictors of later life home care use. Home care use at ages 57–69 years is also highly related to and interacts with father’s socioeconomic status and recruits’ education at age 18. Discussion Specific health characteristics identified at age 18 are highly related to the later utilization of home-care at age 57–69 years. Some characteristics may be amenable to early life health interventions to decrease the future costs of long-term home care."
