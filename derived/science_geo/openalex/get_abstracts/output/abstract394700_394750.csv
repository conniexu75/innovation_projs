However, the monomeric state of this aggregation-prone peptide has remained beyond the reach of most experimental techniques, and a quantitative understanding of this transition is yet to emerge. Here, we employ single-molecule level fluorescence tools to characterize the monomeric state and the monomer-oligomer transition at physiological concentrations in buffers mimicking the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our measurements show that the monomer has a hydrodynamic radius of 0.9 ± 0.1 nm, which confirms the prediction made by some of the in silico studies. Surprisingly, at equilibrium, both Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) remain predominantly monomeric up to 3 μm, above which it forms large aggregates. This concentration is much higher than the estimated concentrations in the CSF of either normal or diseased brains. If Aβ oligomers are present in the CSF and are the key agents in Alzheimer pathology, as is generally believed, then these must be released in the CSF as preformed entities. Although the oligomers are thermodynamically unstable, we find that a large kinetic barrier, which is mostly entropic in origin, strongly impedes their dissociation. Thermodynamic principles therefore allow the development of a pharmacological agent that can catalytically convert metastable oligomers into nontoxic monomers."

Characterizing the peptide substrate specificity of each isoform is critical to understanding their properties, biological roles, and significance. Presently, only the specificities of ppGalNAc T1, T2, and T10 and the fly orthologues of T1 and T2 have been systematically characterized utilizing random peptide substrates. We now extend these studies to ppGalNAc T3, T5, and T12, transferases variously associated with human disease. Our results reveal several common features; the most striking is the similar pattern of enhancements for the three residues C-terminal to the site of glycosylation for those transferases that contain a common conserved Trp. In contrast, residues N-terminal to the site of glycosylation show a wide range of isoform-specific enhancements, with elevated preferences for Pro, Val, and Tyr being the most common at the −1 position. Further analysis reveals that the ratio of positive (Arg, Lys, and His) to negative (Asp and Glu) charged residue enhancements varied among transferases, thus further modulating substrate preference in an isoform-specific manner. By utilizing the obtained transferase-specific preferences, the glycosylation patterns of the ppGalNAc Ts against a series of peptide substrates could roughly be reproduced, demonstrating the potential for predicting isoform-specific glycosylation. We conclude that each ppGalNAc T isoform may be uniquely sensitive to peptide sequence and overall charge, which together dictates the substrate sites that will be glycosylated.

Mucin-type O-glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications of secreted and membrane-associated proteins. Glycoproteins containing O-glycosylated mucin domains serve many important biological roles chiefly because of their unique biophysical and structural properties that include an extended peptide conformation and robust resistance to proteases. Consequently, glycoproteins containing O-glycosylated mucin domains function in the protection of the cell surface, the modulation of cell-cell interactions, in the inflammatory and immune response, in metastasis and tumorigenesis, and in protein sorting, targeting, and turnover (for examples see Refs. 1Tian E.

It is also likely that such O-glycosylated domains may further present a molecular code for the specific recognition of additional binding partners, enzymes, or even other glycosyltransferases. In some instances, specific mucin-type O-glycosylation may modulate receptor activity (6Herr P. Korniychuk G. Yamamoto Y. Grubisic K. Oelgeschläger M.

Mucin-type protein O-glycosylation is initiated in the Golgi compartment by the transfer of α-GalNAc, from UDP-GalNAc, 5The abbreviations used are: UDP-GalNAc, uridine diphosphate N-α-acetylgalactosamine; ppGalNAc T, UDP-α-GalNAc, polypeptide N-α-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase; T-synthase, UDP-Gal, glycoprotein-α-GalNAc β3 galactosyltransferase; Core 2-O-sLex, NeuNAcα2–3Galβ1–4 (Fucα1-3)GlcNAcβ1–6 (Galβ1–3)GalNAcα1-O-Thr/Ser; h, human. to Ser and Thr residues of polypeptide acceptors by the large family (∼20) of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAc Ts). By subsequent action of a series of specific glycosyltransferases, the O-linked glycan can be further elongated to produce a vast array of glycan structures (14Brockhausen I. Johannis P.K. Comprehensive Glycoscience: From Chemistry to System Biology. 3. Elsevier, Oxford2007: 33-59Google Scholar). Unlike the N-glycosylation of Asn residues and the O-xylosylation of Ser residues of proteoglycans, there are no highly specific sequence motifs (i.e. Asn-Xaa (not Pro)-(Ser/Thr) and acidic-acidic-Xaa-Ser-Gly-Xaa-Gly, respectively (15Walmsley A.R.

Nevertheless, data base analysis of known mucin-type O-glycosylation sites have resulted in a number of algorithms (17Elhammer A.P. Poorman R.A. Brown E. Maggiora L.L. Hoogerheide J.G. Kézdy F.J. J.

C., Dayal, Y., and Leung, M.-Y., O-Glycosylation Prediction Electronic Tool, University of Texas, El Paso). for the approximate prediction of mucin-type O-glycosylation. None of these approaches, however, readily account for the wide range and remarkable reproducibility of the O-glycan site-to-site occupancy observed in the mucins that have been characterized to date (20Gerken T.A.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9888-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Importantly, the predictive approaches do not take into account the different peptide substrate specificities of the various ppGalNAc T isoforms. Structurally the ppGalNAc Ts consist of an N-terminal catalytic domain tethered by a short linker to a C-terminal ricin-like lectin domain containing three recognizable carbohydrate-binding sites (22Fritz T.A. Raman J. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Some members of the ppGalNAc T family prefer substrates that have been previously modified with O-linked GalNAc on nearby Ser/Thr residues, hence having so-called glycopeptide or filling-in activities, i.e. ppGalNAc T7 and T10 (23Bennett E.P.

These latter transferases have been called early or initiating transferases, preferring nonglycosylated over glycosylated substrates. The roles of the catalytic and lectin domains on modulating ppGalNAc T peptide and glycopeptide specificity are not fully understood. It has been shown that the presence of the lectin domain of ppGalNAc T2 significantly shifts the preferred sites of glycosylation on glycopeptide substrates (23Bennett E.P. Hassan H.

Clearly, detailed studies of the catalytic and lectin domain specificities of these transferases are necessary to fully understand their properties. Several ppGalNAc T isoforms have been shown to be necessary for, or associated with, normal development, cellular processes, or specific disease states, presumably by possessing specific protein targets that other coexpressed ppGalNAc T isoforms fail to recognize. 7Note that there is also a possibility that the observation of the loss of a glycosylation site in vivo may simply be that no other ppGalNAc Ts are expressed and not necessarily because the mutant transferase is necessarily substrate-specific. The possibility of mis-trafficking/localization at the Golgi membrane could also result in the apparent loss of transferase activity. For example, inactive mutations in the fly PGANT35A (the ppGalNAc T11 orthologue in mammals) are lethal (31Ten Hagen K.G. Tran D.T. J. Biol.

Obviously, there is a need for characterizing the peptide substrate specificity of each isoform to further elucidate their specific targets and mechanism of action. This information is critical for our understanding of the biological roles and significance of the ppGalNAc T family of transferases and mucin-type O-glycosylation in general. Our laboratory has recently reported the use of a series of oriented random peptide and glycopeptide substrate libraries for quantitatively determining the amino acid residue preferences of the catalytic domains of ppGalNAc T1, T2, and T10 and the fly orthologues of T1 and T2 (30Perrine C.L.

In this study, we extend our studies to three additional members of the family, ppGalNAc T3, T5, and T12, with potential roles in human disease, utilizing two previously reported random peptide substrates and an additional new substrate capable of obtaining preferences for neighboring nonglycosylated Ser residues (Table 1). With these substrates, unique substrate preference data for all amino acid residues except Thr, Trp, and Cys have now been obtained for the following six mammalian ppGalNAc Ts: T1, T2, T3, T5, T10, and T12. Our findings have revealed both common and unique features among the transferases characterized to date. The most striking was the very similar pattern of enhancements for those residues C-terminal to the site of glycosylation, particularly enhancements at +1 and +3 for Pro, found in all the ppGalNAc Ts characterized except the glycopeptide preferring ppGalNAc T10 (24Cheng L.

A structural analysis suggests these enhancements arise from interactions with a common conserved Trp residue found in these transferases. In contrast, residues N-terminal to the site of glycosylation show a range of enhancements that are isoform-specific, with elevated preferences for Pro, Val, Ile, and Tyr being the most common. Further analysis revealed that the ratio of positive (Arg, Lys, and His) to negative (Asp and Glu) charged residue preferences varied among transferases with ppGalNAc T1 and T2 preferring the most acidic substrates, with ppGalNAc T5 and T3 preferring the most basic. We also show that these observations are consistent with the homology modeled structures of the ppGalNAc Ts. Thus, the peptide sequence and overall charge serve to modulate the peptide substrate specificity of each ppGalNAc T. Coupled with the variable sensitivity of each isoform to prior substrate glycosylation (20Gerken T.A. Gilmore M. Zhang J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2030721984,"Gene mutations in the phosphoinositide-metabolizing enzymes are linked to various human diseases. In mammals, PIKfyve synthesizes PtdIns(3,5)P(2) and PtdIns5P lipids that regulate endosomal trafficking and responses to extracellular stimuli. The consequence of pikfyve gene ablation in mammals is unknown. To clarify the importance of PIKfyve and PIKfyve lipid products, in this study, we have characterized the first mouse model with global deletion of the pikfyve gene using the Cre-loxP approach. We report that nearly all PIKfyve(KO/KO) mutant embryos died before the 32-64-cell stage. Cultured fibroblasts derived from PIKfyve(flox/flox) embryos and rendered pikfyve-null by Cre recombinase expression displayed severely reduced DNA synthesis, consistent with impaired cell division causing early embryo lethality. The heterozygous PIKfyve(WT/KO) mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and developed into adulthood. PIKfyve(WT/KO) mice were ostensibly normal by several other in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro criteria despite the fact that their levels of the PIKfyve protein and in vitro enzymatic activity in cells and tissues were 50-55% lower than those of wild-type mice. Consistently, steady-state levels of the PIKfyve products PtdIns(3,5)P(2) and PtdIns5P selectively decreased, but this reduction (35-40%) was 10-15% less than that expected based on PIKfyve protein reduction. The nonlinear decrease of the PIKfyve protein versus PIKfyve lipid products, the potential mechanism(s) discussed herein, may explain how one functional allele in PIKfyve(WT/KO) mice is able to support the demands for PtdIns(3,5)P(2)/PtdIns5P synthesis during life. Our data also shed light on the known human disorder linked to PIKFYVE mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1982697237,"Flavivirus NS5 protein encodes methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities. Structural analysis of flavivirus RdRp domains uncovered two conserved cavities (A and B). Both cavities are located in the thumb subdomains and represent potential targets for development of allosteric inhibitors. In this study, we used dengue virus as a model to analyze the function of the two RdRp cavities. Amino acids from both cavities were subjected to mutagenesis analysis in the context of genome-length RNA and recombinant NS5 protein; residues critical for viral replication were subjected to revertant analysis. For cavity A, we found that only one (Lys-756) of the seven selected amino acids is critical for viral replication. Alanine substitution of Lys-756 did not affect the RdRp activity, suggesting that this residue functions through a nonenzymatic mechanism. For cavity B, all four selected amino acids (Leu-328, Lys-330, Trp-859, and Ile-863) are critical for viral replication. Biochemical and revertant analyses showed that three of the four mutated residues (Leu-328, Trp-859, and Ile-863) function at the step of initiation of RNA synthesis, whereas the fourth residue (Lys-330) functions by interacting with the viral NS3 helicase domain. Collectively, our results have provided direct evidence for the hypothesis that cavity B, but not cavity A, from dengue virus NS5 polymerase could be a target for rational drug design.

The genus Flavivirus from the family Flaviviridae contains more than 70 viruses, many of which are important human pathogens causing major public health threats worldwide. Dengue virus (DENV) 2The abbreviations used are: DENV, dengue virus; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; WNV, West Nile virus; HCV, hepatitis C virus; IFA, immunofluorescence assay; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; p.t., post-transfection; BBT, 2′-[2-benzothiazoyl]-6′-hydroxybenzothiazole. is a mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for 50–100 million human infections and ∼20,000 deaths each year (1Gubler D. Kuno G. Markoff L. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 5th Ed. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 1153-1253Google Scholar). Besides DENV, West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus also cause significant human diseases (1Gubler D. Kuno G. Markoff L. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 5th Ed. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 1153-1253Google Scholar). No antiviral therapy is currently available for treatment of flavivirus infections. Therefore, development of antiviral therapy is urgently needed for flaviviruses. The flavivirus genome is a single strand, plus-sense RNA of about 11 kb in length. The genomic RNA contains a 5′-untranslated region (UTR), a single open reading frame, and a 3′-UTR. The single open reading frame encodes a long polyprotein that is processed by viral and host proteases into 10 mature viral proteins (2Lindenbach B.D. Thiel H.J. Rice C.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 5th Ed. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 1101-1151Google Scholar). Three structural proteins (capsid, pre-membrane, and envelope) are primarily involved in virus particle formation, and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) are mainly responsible for viral replication (2Lindenbach B.D. Thiel H.J. Rice C.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. 5th Ed. Fields Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 1101-1151Google Scholar). Among these, NS3 and NS5 possess enzymatic activities and have been targeted for antiviral development. NS3 functions as a protease (with NS2B as a cofactor), helicase, 5′-RNA triphosphatase, and nucleoside triphosphatase (3Falgout B. Miller R.H. Lai C.J. J.

Virology. 1993; 197: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). NS5 is the largest and the most conserved viral protein. The N-terminal part of NS5 is a methyltransferase that methylates the N-7 and 2′-O positions of the viral RNA cap structure (6Zhou Y. Ray D. Zhao Y. Dong H. Ren S. Li Z. Guo Y. Bernard K.A. Shi P.Y.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar); the C-terminal part of NS5 has an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity (10Ackermann M. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol.

Virology. 1996; 216: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Because the RdRp activity is essential for viral replication, and human host cells are devoid of RdRp, it is an attractive target for antiviral development. Two approaches have been successfully used to develop RdRp inhibitors in clinical trials for hepatitis C virus (HCV) (12Deore R.R. Chern J.W. Curr. Med. Chem. 2010; 17: 3806-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a virus closely related to flavivirus. The first approach is based on a nucleoside analogue. Nucleoside analogues function as RNA chain terminators to block viral RNA synthesis. The second approach is based on an allosteric inhibitor. Allosteric inhibitors bind to pockets on polymerase to block conformational changes required for enzyme function. Both nucleoside analogues and allosteric inhibitors (targeting one of the four pockets in HCV RdRp) are currently in clinical trials (12Deore R.R. Chern J.W. Curr. Med. Chem. 2010; 17: 3806-3826Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The success of HCV RdRp inhibitors suggests that the same approaches could be used to develop inhibitors of flavivirus RdRp. Flavivirus RdRp initiates the RNA synthesis via a de novo mechanism, which differs from a primer-dependent mechanism used by other viruses, such as poliovirus and SARS-CoV (10Ackermann M.

Antiviral Res. 2008; 80: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) recently proposed two cavities (named cavities A and B) that were conserved in the crystal structures of DENV and WNV RdRp. Both cavities are located in the thumb subdomain and could be potentially targeted for development of small molecule inhibitors. However, the biological relevance of the cavities has not been validated. In this study, we performed a biochemical and genetic analysis of the two cavities conserved among flavivirus RdRp. Mutagenesis analysis was used to analyze the function of the cavities in viral replication. Residues critical for viral replication were subjected to revertant analysis. In addition, the critical residues were further examined for their roles in RdRp activity. Our results demonstrate that cavity B, but not cavity A, is essential for DENV replication. Mutations in cavity B could abrogate viral replication by decreasing the initiation of RdRp activity; alternatively, mutations in cavity B could suppress viral replication by interference with the interaction between the NS5 and NS3 helicase domains. The results have provided functional evidence that cavity B could be a rational target for drug discovery. Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) and African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. DENV-2 TSV01 strain (GenBankTM accession number AY037116) was first isolated from a patient in Australia in 1993 and then was passaged on C6/36 cells five times (19Schul W. Liu W. Xu H.Y. Flamand M. Vasudevan S.G. J. Infect. Dis. 2007; 195: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The DENV-2 TSV01 from cell culture fluids was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. To construct a full-length DENV-2 TSV01 cDNA clone, the virus stock was subjected to viral RNA extraction by RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and four cDNA fragments (A–D) covering the complete genome were amplified from viral RNA by RT-PCR using SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR kits (Invitrogen). The supplemental Fig. 1A depicts the cloning scheme to construct the cDNA of full-length genomic RNA of DENV-2. Fragment A contained an NheI restriction site, a T7 promoter sequence, and cDNA representing nucleotides 1–2,428 of the viral genome, followed by an extra XhoI restriction site. The RT-PCR product of fragment A was cloned into a predigested low copy number plasmid pACYC177 (New England Biolabs), resulting in pACYC TSV-A plasmid. Fragment B spanned from the EcoRI site (nucleoside position 2,340) to the XhoI site (nucleoside position 5,426). Fragment C spanned from the XhoI (nucleoside position 5,426) site to the AgeI site (nucleoside position 7,613). Fragment D spanned from the AgeI site (nucleoside position 7,613) to the 3′ end of the genome, followed by a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence and an extra ClaI site. The RT-PCR products of fragments B–D were individually ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO with TOPO TA cloning kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), resulting in constructs TA TSV-B, -C, and -D, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1A). Each subclone was validated by DNA sequencing before it was used for subsequent assembly. Next, fragment B was inserted into subclone pACYC TSV-A at the EcoRI and XhoI site, resulting in construct pACYC TSV-E. Fragment C was inserted into subclone TA TSV-D at the XhoI and AgeI sites, yielding plasmid TA TSV-F. Finally, the fragments C and D from plasmid TA TSV-F was inserted into construct pACYC TSV-E at the XhoI and ClaI sites, resulting in the full-length cDNA clone pACYC FLTSV. Escherichia coli HB101 (Promega) was used as the host for construction and propagation of cDNA clones. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. The genome-length cDNA clones with cavity mutations in NS5 RdRp were constructed by using the subclone TA TSV-F. The mutations were introduced into the plasmid TA TSV-F by the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene); the mutated DNA fragment was cut and inserted into the pACYC FLTSV at the NruI (located at nucleotide 7,737 of the viral genome) and ClaI sites. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The genome-length RNA of DENV-2 TSV01 was transcribed in vitro from the corresponding cDNA plasmids that were linearized with ClaI.

A series of 1:10 dilutions were made by mixing 15 μl of virus sample with 135 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. One hundred microliters of undiluted and 10-fold dilutions of viral supernatant were seeded to individual wells of 24-well plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h with shaking every 15 min, and then the virus inocula were replaced with 0.6 ml of RPMI 1640 medium plus 0.8% methylcellulose (Aquacide II, Calbiochem) and 2% FBS. After 4 days of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formalin and stained with 1% crystal violet. For some mutant viruses, the incubation period was more than 4 days to visualize the plaques. Five mutant viruses defective in viral replication were subjected to revertant analysis by continuously culturing on Vero cells for seven rounds. For each round of culturing, Vero cells (1 × 106 cells) in a T-25 flask were infected with 500 μl of culture supernatant derived from the previous passaging and cultured in DMEM with 2% FBS in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cytopathic effect was monitored under a microscope. The incubation period last 5 days unless an apparent cytopathic effect appeared earlier. Viral RNA extracted from culture supernatants of passages 2 and 7 was subjected to RT-PCR using SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR kits (Invitrogen). The entire NS5 region or the complete viral genome was sequenced. Recombinant protein of full-length DENV-4 NS5 was prepared using an E. coli expression system and purified through affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Mutagenesis of the NS5 expression plasmid was performed using QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit. The detailed protocols for mutagenesis, protein expression, and purification have been reported previously (25Niyomrattanakit P. Chen Y.L. Dong H. Yin Z. Qing M. Glickman J.F. Lin K. Mueller D. Voshol H. Lim J.Y. Nilar S. Keller T.H. Shi P.Y. J. Virol. 2010; 84: 5678-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Two types of RdRp assays were performed, de novo RdRp assay and elongation RdRp assays. The de novo RdRp reaction (25 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 mm DTT, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm UTP, 0.5 mm CTP, 2.5 μCi of [α-33P]GTP (10 μCi/μl, 3,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Science), 0.25 μg of NS5, 0.5 μg of RNA template. The RNA template was transcribed in vitro from a PCR product using a T7 MEGAscript kit (Applied Biosystems). The PCR template contained a T7 promoter followed by a cDNA fragment representing a DENV-2 subgenome with a deletion from nucleotide 169 to 10,263 (GenBankTM accession number AF038403.1). The de novo RdRp reactions were incubated at 23 °C for 30 min; the mixtures were passed through a MicroSpin G-25 column (GE Healthcare) to remove unincorporated NTPs; and the RNA elute was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 10 μl of RNase-free water, mixed with an equal volume of denaturing Gel Loading Buffer II (Applied Biosystems), and loaded onto a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel with 7 m urea. A PhosphorImager was used to quantify the 33P-labeled RNA products. The elongation RdRp assay was performed using an RNA template and a 2′-[2-benzothiazoyl]-6′-hydroxybenzothiazole (BBT)-ATP as a substrate mimic (26Niyomrattanakit P. Abas S.N. Lim C.C. Beer D. Shi P.Y. Chen Y.L. J. Biomol. Screen. 2011; 16: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The BBT-ATP was chemically synthesized by attaching the BBT fluorophore group to the γ-phosphate of adenosine triphosphate. During the polymerization reaction, the adenosine monophosphate was incorporated into the RNA chain, releasing BBTppi as a by-product. BBTppi was then hydrolyzed by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, producing two inorganic phosphates (Pi) and BBT, which yields fluorescence. The details of assay conditions were recently reported (26Niyomrattanakit P. Abas S.N. Lim C.C. Beer D. Shi P.Y. Chen Y.L. J. Biomol. Screen. 2011; 16: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SPR measurements were performed on Biacore 3000 equipment (Biacore, GE Healthcare). All experiments were run with a constant flow rate of 30 μl/min HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.0005% P-20). Wild-type full-length DENV-4 NS5 and its mutants (single mutant, K330A and G840R; double mutant K330A/G840R) were amine-coupled onto the surface of a CM5 chip (Biacore, GE Healthcare). A 3-fold serially diluted DENV-4 full-length NS3 (0.1–24 μm) or its helicase domain (1–244 μm) was injected in duplicate across the chip for 1 min, and dissociation was monitored for 2.5 min. Recombinant full-length NS3 and its helicase domain proteins were prepared as reported previously (27Luo D. Xu T. Hunke C. Grüber G. Vasudevan S.G. Lescar J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A short pulse (30 s) of 15 mm HCl was passed through the flow system to completely remove any residual bound protein to prepare for the next injection cycle. Raw sensorgrams obtained were aligned, solvent-corrected, and double-referenced using Scrubber 2 software (BioLogic Software, Campbell, Australia). Processed data were globally analyzed and fit to a simple 1:1 interaction model using numeric integration to yield the individual affinities. The low copy number plasmid pACYC177 and E. coli HB101 were used to construct the cDNA clone of the DENV-2 TSV01 strain. The selection of pACYC177 as the cloning vector was based on our previous experience in WNV infectious clones (6Zhou Y. Ray D. Zhao Y. Dong H. Ren S. Li Z. Guo Y. Bernard K.A. Shi P.Y. Li H. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 3891-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The supplemental Fig. 1A shows the overall scheme of the cloning strategy (see details under “Experimental Procedures”). The assembled full-length cDNA clone contained a T7 promoter at the 5′ end for in vitro transcription and a 67-bp hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence at the 3′ end for generating the authentic 3′ end viral sequence. The stability of the cDNA clone was tested by six rounds of plasmid extraction and re-transformation into E. coli HB101. DNA sequencing of the 6th round plasmid did not show any mutations throughout the cDNA insert (data not shown), demonstrating the stability of the clone. BHK-21 cells transfected with the in vitro transcribed genome-length RNA exhibited an apparent cytopathic effect on day 5 post-transfection (p.t.). IFA of the transfected cells showed increasing numbers of cells expressing viral E protein from day 1 to 3; more than 80% of the cells were IFA-positive on day 3 p.t. (supplemental Fig. 1B). Plaque assay of the culture fluids showed an increase in viral titer from day 1 to 4, peaking at 1 × 106 to 1 × 107 pfu/ml on day 4 p.t. (supplemental Fig. 1C). Specific infectivity assay showed that transfection of BHK-21 cells with 1 μg of RNA generated about 1.2 × 105 pfu of virus. The results demonstrate that the RNA transcribed from the cDNA clone was highly infectious. Structure analysis uncovered two cavities conserved in DENV and WNV RdRps (18Malet H. Massé N. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Alvarez K. Guillemot J.C. Tolou H. Yap T.L. Vasudevan S. Lescar J. Canard B. Antiviral Res. 2008; 80: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The two cavities (A and B) are located on two opposite sides of the thumb subdomain of DENV and WNV RdRp. Fig. 1A shows the two cavities on the crystal structure of DENV-3 RdRp. On DENV-2 RdRp, cavity A is formed by amino acids Lys-756, Gln-760, Ser-763, Asn-777, Cys-780, Ser-785, Thr-806, Glu-807, Asp-808, Met-809, Leu-810, and Tyr-882, among which Lys-756, Thr-806, Glu-807, Asp-808, Met-809, and Leu-810 are completely conserved among various members of flaviviruses (Fig. 1B). Cavity B consists of amino acids Leu-327, Leu-328, Lys-330, Thr-858, Trp-859, Asn-862, Ile-863, and Ala-866, among which Leu-328, Trp-859, and Ile-863 are conserved among flaviviruses (Fig. 1B). To determine the biological function of cavity A, we selected seven amino acids for mutagenesis analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A (left panel), Lys-756 (red), Gln-760 (green), Cys-780 (blue), and Met-809 (tint) are located deep inside the cavity. Thr-806 (magenta), Glu-807 (cyan), and Asp-808 (orange) form the left side wall of the cavity. Among the seven selected residues, five amino acids (Lys-756, Thr-806, Glu-807, Asp-808, and Met-809) are completely conserved among flaviviruses; two residues (Gln-760 and Cys-780) have variations in yellow fever virus and/or tick-borne encephalitis virus RdRp (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that residues Thr-806, Glu-807, Asp-808, and Met-809 also form the C-terminal part of the priming loop (16Yap T.L. Xu T. Chen Y.L. Malet H. Egloff M.P. Canard B. Vasudevan S.G. Lescar J. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 4753-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Each of the selected residues was mutated to Ala in the infectious clone of DENV-2 TSV01. Equal amounts of wild-type (WT) and mutant genome-length RNAs were electroporated into BHK-21 cells. Viral protein synthesis, plaque morphology, and virus production were compared. For viral protein synthesis, IFAs (detecting viral E protein) showed that similar percentages of IFA-positive cells were detected for the WT and mutants T806A, E807A, and D808A RNAs at 72 h p.t.; mutants Q760A, C780A, and M809A showed a slight decrease in the percentage of IFA-positive cells, and mutant K756A remained less than 1% IFA-positive cells at 72 h p.t. (Fig. 2A). For different RNA mutants, the relative IFA-positive cells were similar when the transfected cells were analyzed at 24 and 48 h p.t. (data not shown). No infectious virus was recovered from the K756A RNA-transfected cells, whereas other mutant RNAs yielded similar amounts of infectious viruses with no significant difference in plaque morphology (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that only K756A among the selected mutations in cavity A is essential for viral replication. Four residues were selected for mutagenesis analysis of cavity B. As depicted in Fig. 1A (right panel), Leu-328 (red) and Ile-863 (pink) are located at the bottom of the cavity; Trp-859 (blue) is at the side of cavity wall; and Lys-330 (green) is on the surface of the cavity. The four residues were individually mutated to Ala in the genome-length RNA of DENV-2 TSV01. Unlike cavity A mutants, genome-length RNAs containing the mutations in cavity B showed a significant decrease in viral protein synthesis in the transfected BHK-21 cells. At 72 h p.t., ∼5% of the cells transfected with I863A RNA expressed viral protein; less than 1% of IFA-positive cells were detected for L328A and K330A; no IFA-positive cells was detected in cells transfected with W859A RNA (Fig. 2C). In agreement with the IFA results, only the I863A RNA-transfected cells yielded viruses (Fig. 2D) with tiny plaques (Fig. 2C); no plaque was detected from the L328A, K330A, and W859A RNA-transfected cells, up to 120 h p.t. (Fig. 2, C and D). Overall, the results indicate that cavity B plays a critical role in viral replication. To determine whether the cavities play a direct role in RdRp activity, we prepared a panel of full-length DENV-4 NS5 proteins and analyzed the mutational effects on polymerase activity. The reason to choose DENV-4 NS5 was that this protein was more stable than DENV-2 NS5 (data not shown). All five replication-defective NS5 mutations (L328A, K330A, K756A, W859A, and I863A) were engineered into recombinant full-length NS5 proteins. The proteins were analyzed in two types of RdRp assays. First, a de novo RdRp assay was performed using a viral subgenomic RNA as template. As shown in Fig. 3A, mutants L328A, W859A, and I863A exhibited only 15, 10, and 7% of the WT activity, respectively, whereas mutants K330A and K756A retained 80 and 82% of the WT activity, respectively. Because the de novo RdRp assay includes steps of initiation and elongation, we next analyzed the mutant NS5 in an elongation RdRp assay (26Niyomrattanakit P. Abas S.N. Lim C.C. Beer D. Shi P.Y. Chen Y.L. J. Biomol. Screen. 2011; 16: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast to the de novo synthesis results, all mutants retained greater than 70% of the WT RNA elongation activity (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3C summarizes the effects of mutations on de novo and elongation RdRp activities. The comparable elongation activities between the WT and mutant NS5 suggest the following: (i) the engineered mutations do not change the global conformation of the NS5 protein; and (ii) the observed defect in de novo RNA synthesis for mutants L328A, W859A, and I863A is not due to variations in protein preparations. These results allowed us to conclude that L328A, W859A, and I863A reduce viral replication on or before de novo initiation, whereas K330A and K756A decrease RNA replication through a nonenzymatic mechanism. Among the mutated amino acids from cavities A and B, five of them resulted in replication-defective viruses (L328A, K330A, K756A, W859A, and I863A; Fig. 2). Only K756A belongs to cavity A; L328A, K330A, W859A, and I863A belong to cavity B (Fig. 1A). We performed revertant analysis by continuous passaging of culture supernatants on Vero cells for seven rounds (P1 to P7). The culture fluids from passages 2 (P2) and 7 (P7) were subjected to plaque assay and sequencing analysis. For cavity A, both the P2 and P7 supernatants of the K756A mutant produced plaque morphology similar to the WT; sequencing of the viruses revealed a true reversion to the WT sequence (data not shown). Together with the result that the K756A RNA-transfected cells (P0) did not yield any infectious virus (Fig. 2, A and B), we conclude that residue Lys-756 in cavity A is essential for viral replication. For cavity B, both P2 and P7 culture fluids derived from the L328A, K330A, and I863A RNAs produced plaques. Sequencing of the recovered viruses showed various reversions. For L328A mutant, the P2 virus had a mixed population of Val (GTA) and Leu (CTA), whereas the P7 virus became a single population of Leu (CTA) (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that the L328A mutant underwent a stepwise reversion of Ala (GCA) → Val (GTA) → Leu (CTA) (mutant nucleotides are underlined), each step with a singl"
https://openalex.org/W1970064077,"Diabetes affects many organs including the stomach. Altered number and function of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), the gastrointestinal pacemaker cells, underlie a number of gastrointestinal motility disorders, including diabetic gastroparesis. In the muscle layers, ICC selectively express Ano1, thought to underlie classical Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents. Mice homozygous for Ano1 knock-out exhibit abnormal ICC function and motility. Several transcripts for Ano1 are generated by alternative splicing of four exons. Here, we report expression levels of transcripts encoded by alternative splicing of Ano1 gene in gastric muscles of patients with diabetic gastroparesis and nondiabetic control tissues. Expression of mRNA from two alternatively transcribed exons are significantly different between patients and controls. Furthermore, patients with diabetic gastroparesis express mRNA for a previously unknown variant of Ano1. The 5' end of this novel variant lacks exons 1 and 2 and part of exon 3. Expression of this variant in HEK cells produces a decreased density of Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) currents that exhibit slower kinetics compared with the full-length Ano1. These results identify important changes in expression and splicing of Ano1 in patients with diabetic gastroparesis that alter the electrophysiological properties of the channel. Changes in Ano1 expression in ICC may directly contribute to diabetic gastroparesis."

The mechanism by which the activity of Notch is regulated during brain development has remained unclear, however. Fbxw7 (also known as Fbw7, SEL-10, hCdc4, or hAgo) is the F-box protein subunit of an Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF)-type ubiquitin ligase complex that plays a central role in the degradation of Notch family members. We now show that mice with brain-specific deletion of Fbxw7 (Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice) die shortly after birth with morphological abnormalities of the brain and the absence of suckling behavior. The maintenance of neural stem cells was sustained in association with the accumulation of Notch1 and Notch3, as well as up-regulation of Notch target genes in the mutant mice. Astrogenesis was also enhanced in the mutant mice in vivo, and the differentiation of neural progenitor cells was skewed toward astrocytes rather than neurons in vitro, with the latter effect being reversed by treatment of the cells with a pharmacological inhibitor of the Notch signaling pathway. Our results thus implicate Fbxw7 as a key regulator of the maintenance and differentiation of neural stem cells in the brain.

The Notch signaling pathway plays pivotal roles in cell fate decisions in a wide variety of cell types (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J.

Notch regulates the expression of a cascade of transcription factors belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix family (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J.

Multiple cleavages of the extracellular domain of the receptor are followed by ligand-induced proteolysis of the intracellular juxtamembrane domain by a γ-secretase that may include members of the presenilin family (12Kopan R.

The cleaved Notch intracellular domain activates proteins of the Hes family present in a complex that includes RBP-J (also known as CSL, CBF1, Su(H), and LAG-1). The Hes proteins subsequently suppress the expression of proneural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, which play key roles in the induction of neurogenesis and regulation of neuronal differentiation (14Cau E.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of Notch signaling is largely dependent on ubiquitilation events. Notch ligands undergo monoubiquitilation mediated by neuralized or mind bomb 1, which triggers ligand endocytosis and consequent Notch activation (19Pavlopoulos E. Pitsouli C. Klueg K.M.

Conditional inactivation of mind bomb 1 in mouse brain resulted in the complete loss of Notch activation associated with the depletion of neural stem cells and the promotion of neural differentiation (21Yoon K.J.

Notch stability is also controlled by ubiquitin ligases. Drosophila Su(dx), a member of the homologous to E6-associated protein C terminus (HECT) family of ubiquitin ligases, has been characterized as a negative regulator of Notch signaling, acting at the level of the postendocytic sorting of Notch. The mammalian ortholog of Su(dx), Itch (atrophin-interacting protein 4), has been shown to have multiple substrates, including Notch. Itch promotes polyubiquitilation of the membrane-anchored form of Notch, resulting in its lysosomal degradation (22Chastagner P. Israël A. Brou C. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the released Notch intracellular domain is targeted for degradation by Fbxw7 2The abbreviations used are: Fbxw7, F-box- and WD repeat domain-containing protein 7; MBP, myelin basic protein; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; ARBP, acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein; BLBP, brain lipid-binding protein; E18.5, embryonic day 18.5; P0.5, postnatal day 0.5; DAPT, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester; pHH3, phosphorylated histone 3. (F-box- and WD repeat domain-containing protein 7; also known as Fbw7, SEL-10, hCdc4, and hAgo), a member of the F-box protein family that determines the substrate specificity of the SCF-type ubiquitin ligase complex (23Nakayama K.I.

However, the precise role of Fbxw7-dependent regulation of Notch stability in control of neural stem cells has remained unknown. We have now examined the consequences of Fbxw7 deficiency in the brain. The major phenotypes associated with such deficiency were found to be neonatal death accompanied by morphological abnormalities in the brain and the apparent accumulation of Notch. The growth of neural stem cells was also enhanced, and the differentiation of these cells was skewed toward astrocytes. We thus propose that Fbxw7 plays a pivotal role in regulation of the abundance of Notch proteins by ubiquitin-dependent degradation in neural stem cells and thereby contributes to generation of the proper number and ratio of neurons and glial cells, a process that is essential for normal brain development.

Examination of embryonic and neonatal phenotypes was performed with mice of the C57BL/6J × 129/Ola background. All mouse experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Kyushu University. Total RNA was extracted by the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method, purified, and subjected (1 μg) to RT with random hexanucleotide primers (QuantiTect RT kit, Qiagen). The resulting cDNA was then subjected to real-time PCR analysis with 1× SYBR Green PCR master mix (Takara) and 200 nm gene-specific primers. Assays were performed in triplicate with a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The amplification protocol comprised initial incubation at 60 °C for 30 s and at 95 °C for 3 s, followed by 40 cycles. The sequences of the various primers (sense and antisense, respectively) were 5′-GGACCCGAGAAGACCTCCTT-3′ and 5′-GCACATCACTCAGAATTTCAATGG-3′ for acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein, 5′-TGCAAAGTCTCAGATTATACC-3′ and 5′-ACTTCTCTGGTCCGCTCCAGC-3′ for Fbxw7 (exon 5), 5′-TATCATGGAGAAGAGGCGAAGG-3′ and 5′-TTCTCTAGCTTGGAATGCCGG-3′ for Hes1, 5′-TCAACAGCAGCATAGAGCAGCT-3′ and 5′-GCGAAGGCTTTGCTGTGTTT-3′ for Hes5, 5′-AAAATGCTGCACACTGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CGAGTCCTTCAATGATGCTCAG-3′ for Hey1, 5′-AAACGACCTCCGAAAGCGA-3′ and 5′-CGGTGAATTGGACCTCATCACT-3′ for Hey2, and 5′-AAAGTGGTGATCCGGACACAAT-3′ and 5′-CCAACCGAACCACAGACTTACA-3′ for BLBP. Reactions for acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein mRNA were performed concurrently on the same plate as those for the test mRNAs, and results were normalized by the corresponding amount of acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein mRNA. Total protein extracts were prepared from tissue or cells with the use of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously (27Kamura T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Okumura F. Hatakeyama S. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Where indicated, protein extracts were diluted in alkaline phosphatase buffer and incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (40 units/30 μl, Takara) for 1 h at 37 °C before immunoblot analysis. Tissue was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. For H&E staining, the tissue was embedded in paraffin and cut into serial sections with a thickness of 4 μm. For immunofluorescence analysis, tissue was embedded in OCT compound (Tissue Tek) and sectioned at a thickness of 10 μm with a cryostat. Immunohistofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (28Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T. Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Hatakeyama S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2069-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were detected with Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). The sections were mounted in Vectashield medium (Vector) and examined with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss). For BrdU labeling, BrdU (50 μg per gram of body weight, BD Biosciences) was injected intraperitoneally into pregnant females. Tissue was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, embedded in paraffin, and cut into serial sections with a thickness of 5 μm. A riboprobe specific for Hes5 mRNA was synthesized with the use of a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche). In situ hybridization was performed with the Ventana HX system. Neurons were isolated from the cerebral cortex at embryonic day 18.5 or postnatal day 0.5 and were cultured with a nerve cell culture system (Sumitomo) in dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). For inhibition of Notch signaling, the cells were cultured with the γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) (Calbiochem). After culturing for 7 days (unless indicated otherwise), the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then incubated with antibodies to βIII-tubulin, GFAP, or MBP. Immune complexes were detected with Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained blue with Hoechst 33258. Approximately 1000 cells per sample were examined for quantitation of marker-positive cells. For primary neurosphere formation, mechanically dissociated telencephalic neurons derived from E14.5 embryos were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells per 2 ml of neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with recombinant mouse EGF (20 ng/ml, Sigma) and recombinant mouse FGF2 (10 ng/ml, R&D Systems) in each well of a six-well plate (Corning). For secondary and tertiary sphere formation, primary or secondary spheres, respectively, were collected and digested with TrypLE Select (Invitrogen) for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were then subjected to gentle trituration, isolated by centrifugation at 130 × g for 5 min, resuspended in proliferation medium with or without DAPT, and plated at a density of 500 cells per 200 μl in each well of a 96-well ultra-low cluster plate (Corning). The numbers of secondary or tertiary neurospheres were counted after culturing for 7 days. Quantitative data are presented as mean ± S.D. and were analyzed by Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We generated mice harboring floxed Fbxw7 alleles in which exon 5 (which encodes the F-box domain) is flanked by loxP sites (25Onoyama I. Tsunematsu R. Matsumoto A. Kimura T. de Alborán I.M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To ablate Fbxw7 in the brain, we crossed these Fbxw7F/F mice with mice harboring a Cre transgene under the control of the Nestin gene promoter (Nestin-Cre mice), which is active throughout the nervous system, including in neural stem cells. We confirmed that almost all floxed alleles were deleted by Cre recombinase and that the corresponding mRNA was depleted in the brain of Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Newborn Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice were found to die within 24 h after birth and were readily distinguished from control animals by their smaller body and absence of milk in the stomach (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that their death resulted from a defect in suckling behavior. Given that pulmonary alveoli were normally inflated in the mutant neonates (Fig. 1E), respiratory distress appeared unlikely to be responsible for their death. Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F embryos were recovered at the expected Mendelian ratio until E17.5 to E18.5, suggesting that the homozygous mutation is not embryonic lethal. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of substantial changes in brain structure in Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice. At E16.5, the third ventricle of the mutant mice was dilated and distorted with a characteristic horizontal sulcus that is not present in the normal brain (Fig. 2A). The abnormal sulcus was also observed in the E18.5 brain. Furthermore, the pons appeared hypoplastic and the cerebellum appeared defective in the mutant embryos (Fig. 2B). The hypoplasia of the brain stem was likely responsible for the defect in suckling behavior, although the precise cause of the defective behavior remains to be elucidated. In addition, the cellularity of the cortex was markedly reduced in the Fbxw7-deficient brain (Fig. 2C). Given that neurogenesis is regulated by the Notch signaling pathway, we examined the expression of Notch proteins and their downstream targets in the brain of the mutant animals. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the abundance of Notch1 and Notch3 was increased in Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice and that this difference with control embryos was maximal at E14.5 to E16.5 (Fig. 3A). The intensity of the more slowly migrating of the two Notch1 bands, which likely corresponded to the phosphorylated form of Notch1 and was virtually undetectable in control embryos, was especially increased in the mutant mice, consistent with the previous observation that the phosphorylated form of Notch is targeted by Fbxw7, as is generally the case for Fbxw7 substrates (25Onoyama I. Tsunematsu R. Matsumoto A. Kimura T. de Alborán I.M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 29Masuda K. Ishikawa Y. Onoyama I. Unno M. de Alboran I.M. Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 1798-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The slower band disappeared after treatment of samples with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 3B), supporting the notion that it indeed corresponded to phosphorylated Notch1. Fbxw7 also targets for degradation various mammalian proteins that control cell cycle progression (23Nakayama K.I. Nakayama K. Nat. Rev.

Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and the mammalian target of rapamycin (37Mao J.H. Kim I.J. Wu D. Climent J. Kang H.C. DelRosario R. Balmain A. Science. 2008; 321: 1499-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The amounts of c-Jun, N-Myc, cyclin E, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (total or phosphorylated forms) were unaffected by deletion of Fbxw7 in the brain (Fig. 3A). The abundance of c-Myc in the brain was not increased in the mutant during embryogenesis, but it was increased in mutant neonates. Consistent with the observed Notch accumulation, RT and real-time PCR analysis revealed that the amounts of mRNAs for downstream targets of Notch, including those for Hes5, Hey1, Hey2, and BLBP, were increased in the brain of Fbxw7-deficient embryos (Fig. 3C). The abundance of Hes1 mRNA was not affected by the deletion of Fbxw7, consistent with previous observations showing that the expression of Hes1 is not necessarily dependent on Notch-RBP-J signaling, especially in the central nervous system at this stage (38Lütolf S. Radtke F. Aguet M. Suter U. Taylor V. Development. 2002; 129: 373-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hitoshi S. Alexson T. Tropepe V. Donoviel D. Elia A.J. Nye J.S. Conlon R.A. Mak T.W. Bernstein A. van der Kooy D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 846-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization analysis also showed that the intensity of the signal for Hes5 mRNA was increased in the brain of Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice at E14.5, although ectopic expression of Hes5 was not observed (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these observations suggested that the abnormal morphology of the brain in Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice was likely attributable to the accumulation of Notch proteins resulting from Fbxw7 ablation and was responsible for the neonatal death of these animals as a result of defective suckling behavior. Notch plays a key role in cell fate decisions associated with the differentiation of neurons and glia. We examined the differentiation orientation of primary cultures of cells derived from the neonatal mouse cerebrum at P0.5. The percentage of neurons, as revealed by immunostaining with antibodies to βIII-tubulin, for cells derived from Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice was reduced to about half of that for those derived from control mice (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, the percentage of astrocytes, as revealed by staining with antibodies to GFAP, was markedly increased for Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice compared with that for control animals. The percentage of oligodendrocytes, revealed by staining with antibodies to MBP, did not differ significantly between the two genotypes. These results thus indicated that Fbxw7 is required for generation of neurons and astrocytes in the proper ratio. Neurogenesis occurs predominantly between E12.5 and E16.5, which corresponds to the period when Fbxw7 contributes to the degradation of Notch1 and Notch3 (Fig. 3A). To examine whether Fbxw7 promotes neurogenesis at this stage, we monitored the number of postmitotic cells generated as a result of asymmetrical division at E13 to E14. Neurogenesis was found to be defective in Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice. Thirty hours after labeling with a single pulse of BrdU at E13.25, the number of BrdU-positive cells that had migrated into the Ki67-negative differentiated mantle zone was greater for control mice than for Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice (Fig. 4, C and D). In contrast, astrogenesis, which is initiated at the late embryonic stage, was enhanced in Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice at P0.5 compared with that in control animals (Fig. 4E). These in vitro and in vivo results thus indicated that differentiation was skewed toward astrocytes rather than neurons in the mutant mice, consistent with the observed accumulation of Notch proteins, which inhibit neurogenesis and promote astroglial differentiation. Given that Notch and its downstream target genes contribute to the maintenance of neural stem cells (17Ohtsuka T. Sakamoto M. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30467-30474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 40Sakamoto M. Hirata H. Ohtsuka T. Bessho Y. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44808-44815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the accumulation of Notch and transcriptional activation of its downstream targets apparent in Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice might have been expected to result in an increase in the number of neural stem cells. We therefore measured the proliferative potential of neural stem or progenitor cells in the ventricular zone by staining of mouse brain sections with antibodies to phosphorylated histone H3 (pHH3). Whereas the number of pHH3-positive cells did not differ significantly between Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F and control mice at E14.5, it was substantially greater in the mutant mice at E16.5 (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast to this increased proliferation of neural stem cells in the mutant mice, the number of pHH3-positive progenitor cells in the subventricular and intermediate zones was reduced in Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice at E14.5 (Fig. 5B). The number of intermediate neural progenitor cells, which are stained with antibodies to Tbr2, was decreased in Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice at both E14.5 and E16.5 compared with controls (Fig. 5, C and D). The frequency of apoptosis in the brain did not differ between control and mutant mice during the late embryogenesis (E14.5 to P0.5) (data not shown). These data suggested that the abnormal accumulation of Notch in Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice inhibits the differentiation of neural stem cells, resulting in an increase in the number of these cells and a decrease in the number of mature neurons. We next examined the effect of Fbxw7 deletion on the ability of neural stem cells to proliferate and maintain stemness in vitro with the use of a colony formation (neurosphere) assay. We generated neurospheres from single neural stem cells of the E14.5 mouse brain and examined the expression of genes for proteins in the Notch signaling pathway. Single primary neurosphere colonies were capable of producing secondary neurosphere colonies after 7 days in vitro. The number of descendant neurospheres is thought to provide an estimate of the extent to which the initial neural stem cell underwent symmetrical (expansionary) divisions (41Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Sequential culture experiments revealed that the numbers of secondary and tertiary neurospheres were significantly greater for cells derived from Fbxw7-deficient mice than for those derived from control mice (Fig. 6, A and B). As was evident in the brain, the accumulation of phosphorylated Notch1 was apparent in the tertiary neurospheres derived from Fbxw7-deficient cells (Fig. 6C). In contrast, the abundance of Notch3 was not increased in the Fbxw7-deficient neurospheres, suggesting that the accumulation of Notch1 may be primarily responsible or sufficient for the proliferative nature of the Fbxw7-deficient spheres (Fig. 6D). The abundance of other substrates of Fbxw7 did not differ between the two genotypes (Fig. 6D). These results suggested that neural stemness is excessively maintained in Fbxw7-deficient mice. We also measured the expression of downstream target genes of Notch, including those for Hes1, Hes5, Hey1, Hey2, and BLBP, most of which contribute to the maintenance of neural stem cells. RT and real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of Notch target genes was greater in the tertiary neurospheres derived from Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice than in those from control mice (Fig. 6E). These results suggested that Fbxw7 controls the maintenance of neural stem cells by regulating the level of Notch and the activation of its downstream target genes. To examine whether the increased stemness and skewed neuronal-glial differentiation of neural stem cells induced by Fbxw7 loss were attributable to excessive Notch activation, we exposed primary neuronal cultures or neurospheres to DAPT, an inhibitor of the γ-secretase activity that is necessary for Notch activation. DAPT increased the number of βIII-tubulin-positive neurons and reduced the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes in primary cultures prepared from the cerebrum of Nestin-Cre/Fbxw7F/F mice at E18.5 (Fig. 7, A and B). It also attenuated the increases in the amounts of Hes5 and BLBP mRNAs associated with Fbxw7 deficiency (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, the overproliferation of Fbxw7-deficient neurospheres (Fig. 7D) and the associated transcriptional activation of Notch target genes (Fig. 7E) were reversed by treatment of the cells with DAPT. Together, these results suggested that the up-regulation of Notch abundance is responsible for the increased stemness of neural stem cells and the increased astrogenesis in the Fbxw7-deficient brain. The Notch signaling pathway is thought to play a pivotal role in neuronal and glial cell fate decisions, acting via a process known as lateral inhibition. The products of the proneural genes Mash1 and Ngn2 activate the transcription of Dll1, which encodes a ligand of Notch (Delta-like 1), and the signaling triggered by the Dll1-Notch interaction suppresses the expression of the proneural genes via activation of Hes1 expression and thereby prevents neuronal differentiation (42Kageyama R. Ohtsuka T. Shimojo H. Imayoshi I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We have now provided genetic evidence implicating Fbxw7-mediated control of Notch protein stability in this process, in particular in regulation of the maintenance and differentiation orientation of neural stem cells. Loss of Fbxw7 resulted in Notch accumulation as well as in abnormal activation of Notch target genes, leading to excessive proliferation of neural stem cells and skewed differentiation toward the astrocyte lineage (Fig. 8). The development of the brain initially requires expansion of the progenitor pool by symmetrical division, which is then followed by generation of differentiated cells such as neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes through asymmetrical division. Notch inactivation promotes premature neurogenesis, resulting in exhaustion of the progenitor pool (38Lütolf S. Radtke F. Aguet M. Suter U. Taylor V. Development. 2002; 129: 373-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43de la Pompa J.L. Wakeham A. Correia K.M. Samper E. Brown S. Aguilera R.J. Nakano T. Honjo T. Mak T.W. Rossant J. Conlon R.A. Development. 1997; 124: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final number of mature neurons in mice lacking Notch1 in the brain is thus decreased compared with that in control animals. Mice deficient in presenilin 1, in which Notch is not cleaved on interaction with ligands such as Dll1 and the Notch signaling pathway is therefore disabled, show a similar phenotype (44Shen J. Bronson R.T. Chen D.F. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1997; 89: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 45Handler M. Yang X. Shen J. Development. 2000; 127: 2593-2606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Fbxw7 inactivation in the brain resulted in the accumulation of Notch proteins, leading to expansion of the progenitor pool and a delay in the generation of mature neurons. The formation of neurospheres was thus impaired in cells prepared from mice deficient in Notch1, RBP-J, or prenisilin 1 (39Hitoshi S. Alexson T. Tropepe V. Donoviel D. Elia A.J. Nye J.S. Conlon R.A. Mak T.W. Bernstein A. van der Kooy D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 846-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), whereas it was promoted in those from Fbxw7-deficient mice. The effects of inactivation of Notch and those of Fbxw7 inactivation therefore appear opposite, consistent with the notion that Fbxw7 is a negative regulator of the Notch signaling pathway. The HECT-type ubiquitin ligase Itch (AIP4) also contributes to the control of Notch stability (22Chastagner P. Israël A. Brou C. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Numb, a negative regulator of Notch, recruits Itch to Notch and thereby promotes Notch ubiquitilation (46McGill M.A. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23196-23203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). A mouse strain harboring a mutation in Itch (Itchy mouse) develops severe autoimmune disease (47Melino G. Gallagher E. Aqeilan R.I. Knight R. Peschiaroli A. Rossi M. Scialpi F. Malatesta M. Zocchi L. Browne G. Ciechanover A. Bernassola F. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) but does not manifest a neural defect at the embryonic stage similar to that apparent in Fbxw7-deficient mice. Although the role of Itch in neural development remains unknown, we conclude that Fbxw7-mediated degradation is primarily responsible for the regulation of Notch stability during neural development. In mice lacking Fbxw7 specifically in the hematopoietic lineage, the pool of hematopoietic stem cells becomes exhausted as a result of premature proliferation followed by induction of p53-dependent apoptosis in response to c-Myc accumulation (48Matsuoka S. Oike Y. Onoyama I. Iwama A. Arai F. Takubo K. Mashimo Y. Oguro H. Nitta E. Ito K. Miyamoto K. Yoshiwara H. Hosokawa K. Nakamura Y. Gomei Y. Iwasaki H. Hayashi Y. Matsuzaki Y. Nakayama K. Ikeda Y. Hata A. Chiba S. Nakayama K.I. Suda T. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 986-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the cell cycle as a result of maintenance of c-Myc at a low level by Fbxw7-dependent proteolysis is thought to be required for the maintenance of stemness in hematopoietic stem cells. In contrast, neural stem cells have not been fully characterized, and their properties remain unclear. The neurosphere assay, one of the most widely applied procedures to estimate neural stemness, evaluates the growth of neural stem cells as well as their ability to differentiate into cells of multiple lineages, but the requirement for cell cycle inhibition in neural stem cells remains largely unknown. In this assay, the loss of Fbxw7 promoted cell proliferation in association with the accumulation of Notch1. In contrast to its effects in hematopoietic stem cells, deletion of Fbxw7 in the embryonic brain elicited neither the accumulation of c-Myc nor apoptosis as a result of p53 induction. However, the final number of generated mature neurons was greatly reduced and that of astrocytes was increased at birth as a result of Fbxw7 deficiency, suggesting that the excessive and persistent Notch signaling skews the orientation of differentiation of neural stem cells from neurons to astrocytes. During preparation of the present manuscript, Hoeck et al. (49Hoeck J.D. Jandke A. Blake S.M. Nye E. Spencer-Dene B. Brandner S. Behrens A. Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) described the generation and characterization of mice that lack Fbxw7 in the brain. Although the results of the two independent studies overlap in part, there are differences with regard to astrogenesis, neurosphere formation, and apoptosis between the brain-specific Fbxw7-deficient mice in the previous study and those in our present study (see supplemental Table S1). First, Hoeck et al. (49Hoeck J.D. Jandke A. Blake S.M. Nye E. Spencer-Dene B. Brandner S. Behrens A. Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) found no change in gliogenesis in the brain of their mutant mice at E18.5, whereas we detected a marked increase in astrogenesis in the brain of our Fbxw7-deficient mice at P0.5. Given that gliogenesis begins to increase at the late stage of embryogenesis, a change in this process might be more evident at P0.5 than at E18.5. Second, Hoeck et al. (49Hoeck J.D. Jandke A. Blake S.M. Nye E. Spencer-Dene B. Brandner S. Behrens A. Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) analyzed primary neurospheres, finding that their number and size were decreased for the mutant mice, whereas we studied secondary and tertiary neurospheres and found that the efficiency of sphere formation was significantly increased as a result of Fbxw7 loss. Hoeck et al. (49Hoeck J.D. Jandke A. Blake S.M. Nye E. Spencer-Dene B. Brandner S. Behrens A. Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) also showed that the relative proportion of immature neurons in the Fbxw7-deficient neurospheres was increased, suggesting that this increase might underlie the enhanced formation of secondary spheres observed in our study. The apparently opposite results of the two studies are therefore likely attributable to the difference in the stage of analysis (primary versus secondary and tertiary neurospheres). Third, Hoeck et al. (49Hoeck J.D. Jandke A. Blake S.M. Nye E. Spencer-Dene B. Brandner S. Behrens A. Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) showed that the frequency of apoptosis was increased in neurons of the Fbxw7-deficient brain, and they concluded that the accumulation of c-Jun may be responsible for this phenotype. However, we observed neither an increased frequency of apoptosis (data not shown) nor an increased abundance of c-Jun (Figs. 3A and 6D) in the mutant mice. The reason for this discrepancy remains unclear, but it might be attributable to a difference in genetic background of the mouse strains studied. We also demonstrated a defect in suckling behavior of Fbxw7-deficient neonates as well as anatomic anomalies in the mutant brain. Overall, many results of the two studies are not overlapping but rather complementary, and both provide a better understanding of Fbxw7 function in the brain. We thank D. R.

https://openalex.org/W2075467751,"The distribution of chemical elements in primitive meteorites (chondrites), as building blocks of terrestrial planets, provides insight into the formation and early differentiation of Earth. The processes that resulted in the depletion of some elements [such as chromium (Cr)] in the bulk silicate Earth relative to chondrites, however, remain debated between leading candidate causes: volatility versus core partitioning. We show through high-precision measurements of Cr stable isotopes in a range of meteorites, which deviate by up to ~0.4 per mil from those of the bulk silicate Earth, that Cr depletion resulted from its partitioning into Earth's core, with a preferential enrichment in light isotopes.

Recent studies document IQGAP1 as a scaffold for the MAPK cascade, binding directly to B-Raf, MEK, and ERK and regulating their activation in response to EGF. We previously showed that EGF is unable to activate B-Raf in cells lacking IQGAP1. However, the mechanism by which IQGAP1 links B-Raf to EGFR was unknown. Here we report that endogenous EGFR and IQGAP1 co-localize and co-immunoprecipitate in cells. EGF has no effect on the association, but Ca(2+) attenuates binding. In vitro analysis demonstrated a direct association mediated through the IQ and kinase domains of IQGAP1 and EGFR, respectively. Calmodulin disrupts this interaction. Using a mass spectrometry-based assay, we show that EGF induces phosphorylation of IQGAP1 Ser(1443), a residue known to be phosphorylated by PKC. This phosphorylation is eliminated by pharmacological inhibition of either EGFR or PKC and transfection with small interfering RNA directed against the PKCα isoform. In IQGAP1-null cells, EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR is severely attenuated. Normal levels of autophosphorylation are restored by reconstituting wild type IQGAP1 and enhanced by an IQGAP1 S1443D mutant. Collectively, these data demonstrate a functional interaction between IQGAP1 and EGFR and suggest that IQGAP1 modulates EGFR activation."

https://openalex.org/W2029015537,"Human α(1)-acid glycoprotein (hAGP) in serum functions as a carrier of basic drugs. In most individuals, hAGP exists as a mixture of two genetic variants, the F1*S and A variants, which bind drugs with different selectivities. We prepared a mutant of the A variant, C149R, and showed that its drug-binding properties were indistinguishable from those of the wild type. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of this mutant hAGP alone and complexed with disopyramide (DSP), amitriptyline (AMT), and the nonspecific drug chlorpromazine (CPZ). The crystal structures revealed that the drug-binding pocket on the A variant is located within an eight-stranded β-barrel, similar to that found in the F1*S variant and other lipocalin family proteins. However, the binding region of the A variant is narrower than that of the F1*S variant. In the crystal structures of complexes with DSP and AMT, the two aromatic rings of each drug interact with Phe-49 and Phe-112 at the bottom of the binding pocket. Although the structure of CPZ is similar to those of DSP and AMT, its fused aromatic ring system, which is extended in length by the addition of a chlorine atom, appears to dictate an alternative mode of binding, which explains its nonselective binding to the F1*S and A variant hAGPs. Modeling experiments based on the co-crystal structures suggest that, in complexes of DSP, AMT, or CPZ with the F1*S variant, Phe-114 sterically hinders interactions with DSP and AMT, but not CPZ."

Recent studies have revealed many characteristics of GPR56; biochemical analysis showed that BFPP mutations affect predominantly protein trafficking and hence surface expression of the receptor (19Jin Z.

Mouse tissue transglutaminse (TG2) was identified as a GPR56 binding partner that inhibited metastasis of A375 melanoma cell in vivo (20Xu L. Begum S. Hearn J.D. Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9023-9028Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The presence of another potentially distinct cellular ligand in the pial basement membrane (BM) of cerebral cortex was recently documented (11Li S. Jin Z. Koirala S. Bu L. Xu L. Hynes R.O. Walsh C.A. Corfas G. Piao X. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Experiments using Gpr56 knock-out mice further indicated that GPR56 plays a role in the adhesion of granule cells to the extracellular matrix molecules (ECM) of BM (10Koirala S. Jin Z. Piao X. Corfas G. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7439-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Finally, a role for GPR56 in regulating the migration of neural progenitor cell via a Gα12/13 and Rho pathway was identified recently (21Iguchi T. Sakata K. Yoshizaki K. Tago K. Mizuno N. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14469-14478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Despite these advances, much remains to be learnt regarding the molecular properties of GPR56 receptor. Through the analysis of the wild type (WT) and the BFPP-associated GPR56 point mutants, we identify herein functional characteristics of GPR56 that might provide a molecular explanation for the disorder: 1) stringent requirement for efficient cell surface expression; 2) GPS cleavage-independent shedding of GPR56; 3) Identification of a novel protein ligand that does not interact with the N-terminal BFPP mutants; 4) GPR56-ligand interaction promotes cell adhesion; 5) Localization of the 7TM subunit to membrane lipid rafts. In conclusion, we suggest the null phenotype displayed by the different BFPP-associated mutations results from multiple mechanisms.DISCUSSIONOur extensive analysis of the WT-GPR56 and BFPP-associated point mutants has revealed important biochemical and molecular characteristics of GPR56 receptor that might provide a satisfactory explanation as to how different point mutations cause the same null phenotype. As reported previously and confirmed herein, the major defect caused by the BFPP-associated missense mutations is the defective protein trafficking and reduced membrane expression of GPR56 (19Jin Z. Tietjen I. Bu L. Liu-Yesucevitz L. Gaur S.K. Walsh C.A. Piao X. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 1972-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 26Ke N. Ma H. Diedrich G. Chionis J. Liu G. Yu D.H. Wong-Staal F. Li Q.X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 366: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the functional maturation of GPR56 receptor is highly stringent and depends on its overall conformational stability. Thus, we can conclude the different BFPP-associated point mutations represent amino acid residues important for the proper folding, correct conformation, and hence efficient expression of GPR56. However, the null phenotype observed in BFPP patients cannot be accounted for entirely by the inefficient expression of the GPR56 receptor. Our results suggest that the mutant residues are also involved in different functional aspects of GPR56.We first showed that GPR56 receptor modification is multifaceted, including extensive glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). As with other adhesion-GPCRs, decoration of GPR56 by glycans is expected due to its 7 potential N-glycosylation and numerous O-glycosylation residues. Glycosylation is likely an important post-translational modification for the stability, maturation, and function of all adhesion-GPCRs (22Hsiao C.C. Cheng K.F. Chen H.Y. Chou Y.H. Stacey M. Chang G.W. Lin H.H. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 3285-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that GPR56 receptor might undergo two independent proteolytic modifications: one by GPS auto-proteolysis and the other by unspecified protease(s). First, mutation engineered to abolish GPS proteolysis did not prevent receptor shedding (Fig. 2, D and E). Second, deficiency of receptor proteolysis observed in both C346S and W349S disease mutants is consistent with the fact that the two residues are highly conserved in the GPS motif and confirms that they are important for GPS auto-proteolysis (16Yona S. Lin H.H. Siu W.O. Gordon S. Stacey M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 17Lin H.H. Chang G.W. Davies J.Q. Stacey M. Harris J. Gordon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31823-31832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Third, shedding of the α-subunit can be greatly inhibited by GM6001, a broad-spectrum MMP/ADAM inhibitor. Our results suggest that the shedding of GPR56 α-subunit is independent of its GPS proteolytic modification. Therefore, GPR56 is expressed either as a two-subunit complex on the cell surface or as a soluble α-subunit and a truncated 7TM receptor.Although all BFPP-associated mutations reduce the surface expression of GPR56 to some extent, some mutations such as L640R actually retain a high level of surface expression (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). This reinforces the idea that apart from reduced surface expression there are probably other mechanisms responsible for the null phenotype of BFPP. Indeed, the identification of a TG2-independent ligand seems to provide one reasonable explanation. The use of GPR56-mFc probe allows a sensitive and efficient means for the identification of GPR56-ligand-expressing cells. Furthermore, it enables us to confirm unambiguously that human TG2 is not a cellular ligand for GPR56. This result not only points to the presence of a novel protein ligand for GPR56 but also challenges the biological relevance of the interaction between human GPR56 and mouse TG2 (20Xu L. Begum S. Hearn J.D. Hynes R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9023-9028Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 27Xu L. Hynes R.O. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Importantly, the failure of the N-terminal mutants (R38W, Y88C, and C91S) to bind to the putative ligand strongly suggests that this protein ligand is relevant to BFPP. Recently, Li et al. have also demonstrated the presence of a novel ligand of GPR56 in the ECM of fetal mouse brain using a similar mouse GPR56-mFc protein (11Li S. Jin Z. Koirala S. Bu L. Xu L. Hynes R.O. Walsh C.A. Corfas G. Piao X. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Their follow-up study further indicated that GPR56 plays a role in maintaining the integrity of pial BM by regulating cell adhesion of developing neurons to the BM molecules (10Koirala S. Jin Z. Piao X. Corfas G. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7439-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Most importantly, it seems that the phenotype induced by the loss of GPR56 is not entirely cell-autonomous. Instead, it is likely that GPR56 binding to the novel ligand might exert a reciprocal signaling via the ligand, leading to the phenotypic changes of ligand-expressing cells. In this context, our finding that GPR56-ligand interaction promotes cell adhesion of ligand-expressing cells fits well with this hypothesis. It will be of great interest in the future to reveal and compare the molecular identity of the novel protein ligand identified here and the ECM ligand reported by Li et al. (11Li S. Jin Z. Koirala S. Bu L. Xu L. Hynes R.O. Walsh C.A. Corfas G. Piao X. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).The differential distribution of the α- and β-subunits of WT GPR56 to the different membrane subdomains (lipid raft and non-raft regions) suggests that the two subunits are not always tightly associated on the plasma membrane. Indeed, treatment of receptor-expressing cells with a weak detergent perfluorooctanoic acid (PFO) shows that GPR56 α- and β-subunits can be differentially dissociated from cell membrane by PFO (supplemental Fig. S7C). This result is consistent with earlier data on latrophilin and points to a more complex relationship between the adhesion-GPCR subunits than previously thought (28Silva J.P. Lelianova V. Hopkins C. Volynski K.E. Ushkaryov Y. The J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6495-6506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 29Volynski K.E. Silva J.P. Lelianova V.G. Atiqur Rahman M. Hopkins C. Ushkaryov Y.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4423-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As lipid rafts are an important platform for initiating intracellular signaling, it is possible that the localization of the β-subunit to the raft region plays a role in the signaling function of GPR56. Given the relatively normal surface expression of the α-subunit of R565W and L640R mutants, the tendency of their β-subunit to form large aggregate and locate preferentially in the non-raft regions suggest these two TM mutations most likely inactivate GPR56 function by interfering with intracellular signaling and/or the stability of β-subunit.In conclusion, through the analysis of WT and disease-associated GPR56 mutants we have identified multiple molecular mechanisms relevant to GPR56 biology. These include subcellular trafficking, and expression, GPS auto-proteolysis, receptor shedding, interaction with a novel cellular ligand and differential membrane distribution of receptor subunits. We suggest different BFPP-associated mutations cause the null phenotype via different combination of GPR56 mutant-specific molecular mechanisms.

Radiometric dating of volcanic ash indicates that deposition occurred ~324,000 to 193,000 years ago during parts of Marine Isotope Stages 9, 7, and 6. Fossil pollen and wood preserved within organic sediments suggest that the composition of the forest altered radically in response to glacial-interglacial climate change. The presence of Podocarpus macrofossils ~1000 meters below the lower limit of their modern distribution indicates a relative cooling of at least 5°C during glacials and persistence of wet conditions. Interglacial deposits contain thermophilic palms suggesting warm and wet climates. Hence, global temperature change can radically alter vegetation communities and biodiversity in this region."

Although this process involves cellular membrane receptor integrins, the role of integrins in myogenesis is not well defined. Here, we report a regulatory role of β3-integrin, which was previously thought not expressed in muscle, in the initiation of satellite cell differentiation. Undetected in normal muscle, β3-integrin expression in mouse hindlimb muscles is induced dramatically from 1 to 3 d after injury by cardiotoxin. The source of β3-integrin expression is found to be activated satellite cells. Proliferating C2C12 myoblasts also express β3-integrin, which is further up-regulated transiently on differentiation. Knockdown of β3-integrin expression attenuates Rac1 activity, impairs myogenic gene expression, and disrupts focal adhesion formation and actin organization, resulting in impaired myoblast migration and myotube formation. Conversely, overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 rescues myotube formation. In addition, a β3-integrin-neutralizing antibody similarly blocked myotube formation. Comparing with wild-type littermates, myogenic gene expression and muscle regeneration in cardiotoxin-injured β3-integ-rin-null mice are impaired, as indicated by depressed expression of myogenic markers and morphological disparities. Thus, β3-integrin is a mediator of satellite cell differentiation in regenerating muscle.—Liu, H., Niu, A., Chen, S.-E., Li, Y.-P. β3-Integrin mediates satellite cell differentiation in regenerating mouse muscle.

To date the signaling pathways that regulate NAD+ metabolism remain unclear due to the dynamic nature and complexity of the NAD+ metabolic pathways and the difficulty of determining the levels of the interconvertible pyridine nucleotides. Nicotinamide riboside (NmR) is a key pyridine metabolite that is excreted and re-assimilated by yeast and plays important roles in the maintenance of NAD+ pool. In this study we establish a NmR-specific reporter system and use it to identify yeast mutants with altered NmR/NAD+ metabolism. We show that the phosphate-responsive signaling (PHO) pathway contributes to control NAD+ metabolism. Yeast strains with activated PHO pathway show increases in both the release rate and internal concentration of NmR. We further identify Pho8, a PHO-regulated vacuolar phosphatase, as a potential NmR production factor. We also demonstrate that Fun26, a homolog of human ENT (equilibrative nucleoside transporter), localizes to the vacuolar membrane and establishes the size of the vacuolar and cytosolic NmR pools. In addition, the PHO pathway responds to depletion of cellular nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) and mediates nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) catabolism, thereby contributing to both NmR salvage and phosphate acquisition.

Mutations in the nebulin gene (NEB) lead to muscle weakness and various congenital myopathies. Despite increasing clinical and scientific interest, the pathogenesis of weakness remains unknown. The present study, therefore, aims at unraveling the underlying molecular mechanisms. Hence, we recorded and analyzed the mechanics as well as the X-ray diffraction patterns of human membrane-permeabilized single muscle fibers expressing nebulin mutations. Results demonstrated that, during contraction, the cycling rate of myosin heads attaching to actin is dramatically perturbed, causing a reduction in the fraction of myosin-actin interactions in the strong binding state. This phenomenon prevents complete thin-filament activation, more especially proper and full tropomyosin movement, further limiting additional binding of myosin cross-bridges. At the cell level, this reduces the force-generating capacity and, overall, provokes muscle weakness. To reverse such a negative cascade of events, future potential therapeutic interventions should, therefore, focus on the triggering component, the altered myosin cross-bridge cycling kinetics."

In the skin, activation of LXR induces keratinocyte differentiation and improves epidermal permeability barrier homeostasis. To elucidate the mechanism of LXR action in skin, we mapped its cistrome by identifying LXRβ-RXRα binding sites using ChIP-on-chip in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). The cistrome was integrated with transcription data to obtain a global view of LXR action in keratinocyte biology. Here, we identify 2035 LXRβ-RXRα binding sites containing 4794 LXR response elements in NHEKs and show the presence of consensus heterodimer active regions in genes involved in keratinocyte lipid transport/synthesis and terminal differentiation. Bioinformatics analysis of the cistrome revealed an enrichment of AP1 cis-regulatory motifs in the vicinity of the LXRβ-RXRα binding sites. Importantly, we have demonstrated a direct interaction between LXR and Jun/Fos, indicating that the cooperation between LXR and AP1 may orchestrate keratinocyte differentiation. Finally, we corroborated these results by genome-wide mapping of the c-Fos and c-Jun cistromes in NHEKs, demonstrating that 77% of all the LXRβ-RXRα binding regions show the presence of AP1 motifs at adjacent locations. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of LXR action in keratinocyte differentiation, lipid production and barrier formation, further strengthening the validation of LXR as a potential therapeutic target for skin disorders including skin aging, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2133144393,"In intact mucosal tissues, epithelial cells are anatomically positioned in proximity to a number of subepithelial cell types, including endothelia. A number of recent studies have suggested that imbalances between energy supply and demand can result in “inflammatory hypoxia.” Given these associations, we hypothesized that endothelial-derived, hypoxia-inducible mediators might influence epithelial function. Guided by cDNA micro-array analysis of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1 line) subjected to hypoxia (pO2 20 torr, 8 h), we identified adrenomedullin (ADM) as a prominent hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) that acts on epithelial cells through cell surface receptors. We assessed the functional ability for exogenous ADM to signal in human intestinal Caco2 cells in vitro by demonstrating a dose-dependent induction of Erk1/2phosphorylation. Further analysis revealed that ADM deneddylates cullin-2 (Cul2), whose action has been demonstrated to control the activity of HIF. Caco2 cells stably expressing a hypoxic response element (HRE)-driven luciferase promoter confirmed that ADM activates the HIF signaling pathway. Extensions of these studies revealed an increase in canonical HIF-1-dependent genes following stimulation with ADM. To define physiological relevance, we investigated the effect of ADM in a DSS model of murine colitis. Administration of ADM resulted in reduced inflammatory indices and less severe histological inflammation compared to vehicle controls. Analysis of tissue and serum cytokines showed a marked and significant inhibition of colitis-associated TNF-α, IL-1β, and KC. Analysis of circulating ADM demonstrated an increase in serum ADM in murine models of colitis. Taken together, these results identify ADM as an endogenously generated vascular mediator that functions as a mucosal protective factor through fine tuning of HIF activity.—MacManus, C.F., Campbell, E.L., Keely, S., Burgess, A, Kominsky, DJ., Colgan, S.P.

Mutations of HFE are best known as being associated with cellular iron overload, but the mechanism by which HFE H63D might increase the risk of neuron degeneration is unclear. Here, using an inducible expression cell model developed from a human neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y, we reported that the presence of the HFE H63D protein activated the unfolded protein response (UPR). This response was followed by a persistent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as the signals of UPR sensors attenuated and followed by up-regulation of caspase-3 cleavage and activity. Our in vitro findings were recapitulated in a transgenic mouse model carrying Hfe H67D, the mouse equivalent of the human H63D mutation. In this model, UPR activation was detected in the lumbar spinal cord at 6 months then declined at 12 months in association with increased caspase-3 cleavage. Moreover, upon the prolonged ER stress, the number of cells expressing HFE H63D in early apoptosis was increased moderately. Cell proliferation was decreased without increased cell death. Additionally, despite increased iron level in cells carrying HFE H63D, it appeared that ER stress was not responsive to the change of cellular iron status. Overall, our studies indicate that the HFE H63D mutant protein is associated with prolonged ER stress and chronically increased neuronal vulnerability."

It has been postulated that surrounding keratinocytes contribute to melanocyte migration, but underlying mechanisms remain rather vague so far. In this study, we set out to analyze the specific potential contribution of keratinocyte components to melanocytes and melanoma cell migration-related processes. Our studies revealed that A375 human melanoma cell attachment, spreading, and migration are interestingly better supported by HaCaT keratinocyte extracellular matrix (ECM) than by self-derived A375 ECM. Moreover, HaCaT ECM caused increased integrin α6 expression, adhesion-mediated focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, and focal adhesion formations. Similar effects were confirmed in human melanocytes. Furthermore, we found that keratinocyte-derived soluble factors did not appear to significantly contribute to these processes. Specific extrinsic factors that promoted melanoma migration were attributed to keratinocyte-derived laminin-332, whereas alternative ECM component such as laminin-111 and fibronectin functions appeared to have insignificant contributions. Taken together, these studies implicate extrinsic laminin-332 in promoting the high mobility property and perhaps invasiveness inherently characteristic of, and that are the menace of, melanocytes and melanomas, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1964186423,"A growing body of evidence indicates that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in breast tumor progression and that targeting GPCRs may be a novel adjuvant strategy in cancer treatment. However, due to the redundant role of multiple GPCRs in tumor development, it may be necessary to target a common signaling component downstream of these receptors to achieve maximum efficacy. GPCRs transmit signals through heterotrimeric G proteins composed of Gα and Gβγ subunits. Here we evaluated the role of Gβγ in breast tumor growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that blocking Gβγ signaling with Gα(t) or small molecule inhibitors blocked serum-induced breast tumor cell proliferation as well as tumor cell migration induced by various GPCRs in vitro. Moreover, induced expression of Gα(t) in MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited primary tumor formation and retarded growth of existing breast tumors in nude mice. Blocking Gβγ signaling also dramatically reduced the incidence of spontaneous lung metastasis from primary tumors and decreased tumor formation in the experimental lung metastasis model. Additional studies indicate that Gβγ signaling may also play a role in the generation of a tumor microenvironment permissive for tumor progression, because the inhibition of Gβγ signaling attenuated leukocyte infiltration and angiogenesis in primary breast tumors. Taken together, our data demonstrate a critical role of Gβγ signaling in promoting breast tumor growth and metastasis and suggest that targeting Gβγ may represent a novel therapeutic approach for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2091886055,"Background Pathogens are growing threats to wildlife. The rapid growth of marine salmon farms over the past two decades has increased host abundance for pathogenic sea lice in coastal waters, and wild juvenile salmon swimming past farms are frequently infected with lice. Here we report the first investigation of the potential role of salmon farms in transmitting sea lice to juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Methodology/Principal Findings We used genetic analyses to determine the origin of sockeye from Canada's two most important salmon rivers, the Fraser and Skeena; Fraser sockeye migrate through a region with salmon farms, and Skeena sockeye do not. We compared lice levels between Fraser and Skeena juvenile sockeye, and within the salmon farm region we compared lice levels on wild fish either before or after migration past farms. We matched the latter data on wild juveniles with sea lice data concurrently gathered on farms. Fraser River sockeye migrating through a region with salmon farms hosted an order of magnitude more sea lice than Skeena River populations, where there are no farms. Lice abundances on juvenile sockeye in the salmon farm region were substantially higher downstream of farms than upstream of farms for the two common species of lice: Caligus clemensi and Lepeophtheirus salmonis, and changes in their proportions between two years matched changes on the fish farms. Mixed-effects models show that position relative to salmon farms best explained C. clemensi abundance on sockeye, while migration year combined with position relative to salmon farms and temperature was one of two top models to explain L. salmonis abundance. Conclusions/Significance This is the first study to demonstrate a potential role of salmon farms in sea lice transmission to juvenile sockeye salmon during their critical early marine migration. Moreover, it demonstrates a major migration corridor past farms for sockeye that originated in the Fraser River, a complex of populations that are the subject of conservation concern."

We showed previously that stimulation of the prostate-specific G protein-coupled receptor (PSGR) enhances cytosolic Ca(2+) and inhibits proliferation of prostate cells. Here, we analyzed the signaling mechanisms underlying the PSGR-mediated Ca(2+) increase. Using complementary molecular, biochemical, electrophysiological, and live-cell imaging techniques, we found that endogenous Ca(2+)-selective transient receptor potential vanilloid type 6 (TRPV6) channels are critically involved in the PSGR-induced Ca(2+) signal. Biophysical characterization of the current activated by PSGR stimulation revealed characteristic properties of TRPV6. The molecular identity of the involved channel was confirmed using RNA interference targeting TrpV6. TRPV6-mediated Ca(2+) influx depended on Src kinase activity. Src kinase activation occurred independently of G protein activation, presumably by direct interaction with PSGR. Taken together, we report that endogenous TRPV6 channels are activated downstream of a G protein-coupled receptor and present the first physiological characterization of these channels in situ."

A previously described mouse model engineered to suppress canonical Notch signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) revealed surprising anatomical defects in arterial patterning and vessel maturation, suggesting that vSMCs have the functional capacity to influence blood vessel formation in a Notch signaling-dependent manner. In further analyses using this model system, we now show that explanted aortic ring tissue and Matrigel implants from the smooth muscle Notch signaling-deficient mice yield markedly diminished responses to angiogenic stimuli. Furthermore, cultured Notch signaling-deficient primary vSMCs have reduced proliferation and migration capacities and reveal diminished expression of PDGF receptor β and JAGGED1 ligand. These observations prompted a series of endothelial cell (EC)-vSMC co-culture experiments that revealed a requirement for intact vSMC Notch signals via JAGGED1 for efficient EC Notch1 receptor activation and EC proliferation. Taken together, these studies suggest a heterotypic model wherein Notch signaling in vSMCs provides early instructive cues to neighboring ECs important for optimal postnatal angiogenesis."

A potential class of binding partners are Rab GTPases and Rab3A is known to associate with SVs and is involved in SV trafficking. We performed experiments to determine whether Rab3A interacts with Myo5a and whether it is required for transport of neuronal vesicles. In vitro motility assays performed with axoplasm from the squid giant axon showed a requirement for a Rab GTPase in Myo5a-dependent vesicle transport. Furthermore, mouse recombinant Myo5a tail revealed that it associated with Rab3A in rat brain synaptosomal preparations in vitro and the association was confirmed by immunofluorescence imaging of primary neurons isolated from the frontal cortex of mouse brains. Synaptosomal Rab3A was retained on recombinant GST-tagged Myo5a tail affinity columns in a GTP-dependent manner. Finally, the direct interaction of Myo5a and Rab3A was determined by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation using recombinant mouse Myo5a tail and human Rab3A. When both proteins were incubated in the presence of 1 mm GTPγS, Myo5a tail and Rab3A formed a complex and a direct interaction was observed. Further analysis revealed that GTP-bound Rab3A interacts with both the monomeric and dimeric species of the Myo5a tail. However, the interaction between Myo5a tail and nucleotide-free Rab3A did not occur. Thus, our results show that Myo5a and Rab3A are direct binding partners and interact on SVs and that the Myo5a/Rab3A complex is involved in transport of neuronal vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2090654092,"Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, generated by neutrophils and macrophages in chronically inflamed tissues, readily damage DNA, producing a variety of potentially genotoxic etheno base lesions; such inflammation-related DNA damage is now known to contribute to carcinogenesis. Although the human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG) can specifically bind DNA containing either 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine (εA) lesions or 3,N(4)-ethenocytosine (εC) lesions, it can only excise εA lesions. AAG binds very tightly to DNA containing εC lesions, forming an abortive protein-DNA complex; such binding not only shields εC from repair by other enzymes but also inhibits AAG from acting on other DNA lesions. To understand the structural basis for inhibition, we have characterized the binding of AAG to DNA containing εC lesions and have solved a crystal structure of AAG bound to a DNA duplex containing the εC lesion. This study provides the first structure of a DNA glycosylase in complex with an inhibitory base lesion that is induced endogenously and that is also induced upon exposure to environmental agents such as vinyl chloride. We identify the primary cause of inhibition as a failure to activate the nucleotide base as an efficient leaving group and demonstrate that the higher binding affinity of AAG for εC versus εA is achieved through formation of an additional hydrogen bond between Asn-169 in the active site pocket and the O(2) of εC. This structure provides the basis for the design of AAG inhibitors currently being sought as an adjuvant for cancer chemotherapy."

The multiligand connecting, fluorophore labeling and nanostructure formation of Octa-FNP were performed in one step. In vitro studies showed Octa-FNP is a 10-nm fluorescent probe with excellent serum stability. Cellular uptake of Octa-FNP by human nasopharyngeal cancer 5-8F cells is 15-fold of tetravalent probe, ∼80-fold of monovalent probe and ∼600-fold of nulvalent tfRFP. In vivo enhanced tumor targeting and intracellular uptake of Octa-FNP were confirmed using optical imaging and Western blot analysis. It achieved extremely high contrast of Octa-FNP signal between tumor tissue and normal organs, especially seldom Octa-FNP detected in liver and spleen. Owing to easy preparation, precise structural and functional control, and multivalent effect, Octa-FNP provides a powerful tool for tumor optical molecular imaging and evaluating the targeting ability of numerous peptides in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2132192198,"Type 2 diabetes is highly prevalent in human populations, particularly in obese individuals, and is characterized by progressive pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance. Most mammals, including Old World primates, express two major kinds of sialic acids, Af-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and Af-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), typically found at the distal ends of glycoconjugate chains at the cell surface. Humans are uniquely unable to produce endogenous Neu5Gc due to an inactivating mutation in the CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH) gene. The CMAH enzyme catalyzes the generation of CMP-Neu5Gc by the transfer of a single oxygen atom to the acyl group of CMP-Neu5Ac. Here, we show that mice bearing a human-like deletion of the Ctnah gene exhibit fasting hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance following a high-fat diet. This phenotype is caused not by worsened insulin resistance but by compromised pancreatic β-cell function associated with a 65% decrease in islet size and area and 50% decrease in islet number. Obese Ctnah-null mice also show an ~40% reduction in response to insulin secretagogues in vivo. These findings show that human evolution-like changes in sialic acid composition impair pancreatic β-cell function and exacerbate glucose intolerance in mice. This may lend insight into the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in obese humans.—Kavaler, S., Morinaga, H., Jih, A., Fan, W. Q., Hedlund, M., Varki, A, Kim, J. J.

Alkaline proteases from nematode-parasitic fungi show stronger nematicidal activity in vitro than neutral proteases from nematode-trapping fungi. Sequence alignment of these proteases revealed that the activesite residues were much conserved. Disulfide bridges in alkaline proteases not only contribute to the thermal stability of enzyme structure but also increase the flexibility of S1 and S4 pockets located at the substrate-binding site. Molecular electrostatic potential surfaces of these proteases change gradually from negative to positive while arranging in the order from neutral to alkaline proteases, possibly contributing to the distinct extent of substrate (nematode cuticle) attraction by proteases. The differences in flexibility of substrate-binding site and in electrostatic surface potential distribution between neutral and alkaline cuticle-degrading proteases are associated with the changes of their catalytic activities and nematicidal activities with fungal species. Our results indicate that nematode-parasitic and nematode-trapping fungi have evolved for distinct adaptation under selective pressure.—Liang, L., Liu, S., Yang, J., Meng, Z., Lei, L., Zhang, K.

https://openalex.org/W2024426789,"Human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBDSCs), a novel population isolated from CD34(+) cells by our laboratory, exerted an immunosuppressive effect on xenogenic T cells. This study aimed to investigate whether hUCBDSCs play a critical role in the suppression of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). The hUCBDSCs were co-cultured with splenocytes (SPCs) of donor C57BL/6 mice. The aGVHD in the recipient (B6×BALB/c) F1 mice was induced by the infusion of bone marrow cells and SPCs from donor mice following sublethal irradiation. The shift in vivo for hUCBDSCs was detected. The proliferation and cell cycle of SPCs were tested by cell counting kit-8 and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression of CD49b natural killer (NK) cells and CD3 T cells was detected by flow cytometry in co-culture and post-transplantation. IL-4, and IFN-γ were detected by ELISA in the serum of co-culture and post-transplantation. The survival time, body weight, clinical score, and histopathological score were recorded for mice post-transplantation. The hUCBDSCs promoted the proliferation of SPCs and significantly increased the ratio of the S and G(2)/M phase (p < 0.05). The hUCBDSCs significantly increased the expression of CD49b NK cells and IL-4 protein and decreased the expression of CD3 T cells and IFN-γ protein both in vitro and in vivo. The survival time of mice with co-transplantation of hUCBDSCs was significantly prolonged, and decreased clinical and histopathological scores were also observed. The hUCBDSCs were continually detected in the target organs of GVHD. These results suggest that hUCBDSCs possess the capability of suppressing aGVHD, possibly via their influence on CD3 T cells, NK cells, and cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2133100786,"Cytosolic glucose concentration reflects the balance between glucose entry across the plasma membrane and cytosolic glucose utilization. In adipocytes, glucose utilization is considered very rapid, meaning that every glucose molecule entering the cytoplasm is quickly phosphorylated. Thus, the cytosolic free glucose concentration is considered to be negligible; however, it was never measured directly. In the present study, we monitored cytosolic glucose dynamics in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes by expressing a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based glucose nanosensor: fluorescent indicator protein FLIPglu-600μ. Specifically, we monitored cytosolic glucose responses by varying transmembrane glucose concentration gradient. The changes in cytosolic glucose concentration were detected in only 56% of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and in 14% of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In adipocytes, the resting cytosolic glucose concentration was reduced in comparison with the one recorded in fibroblasts. Membrane permeabilization increased cytosolic glucose concentration in adipocytes, and glycolytic inhibitor iodoacetate failed to increase cytosolic glucose concentration, indicating low adipocyte permeability for glucose at rest. We also examined the effects of insulin and adrenaline. Insulin significantly increased cytosolic glucose concentration in adipocytes by a factor of 3.6; however, we recorded no effect on delta ratio (ΔR) in fibroblasts. Adrenaline increased cytosolic glucose concentration in fibroblasts but not in adipocytes. However, in adipocytes in insulin-stimulated conditions, glucose clearance was significantly faster following adrenaline addition in comparison with controls (p < 0.001).

Together, these results demonstrate that during differentiation, adipocytes develop more efficient mechanisms for maintaining low cytosolic glucose concentration, predominantly with reduced membrane permeability for glucose. Adipocytes utilize glucose to supply energy needs for cellular activities and to promote synthesis and storage of lipids in the cell. Glucose utilization is regulated by the supply of intracellular glucose-6-phosphate. This, in turn, depends on the transport of glucose across the cell membrane and its phosphorylation in the presence of hexokinase and ATP. Adipocytes contain two isoforms of a family of proteins that facilitate transport of glucose across the plasma membrane: GLUT1, the constitutive glucose transporter located mainly at the plasma membrane, and GLUT4, the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter (1Green H. Meuth M. Cell. 1974; 3: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 2Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The effect of insulin to increase glucose uptake is exerted by stimulating the translocation of GLUT4 from an intracellular pool to the plasma membrane and thus increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane to glucose (3Whitesell R.R.

However, the accompanying changes in dynamics of intracellular glucose concentration in a single adipocyte are not known as, until recently, it was not possible to measure this parameter directly. To image and quantify changes in cytosolic glucose, Fehr et al. (6Fehr M. Lalonde S. Lager I. Wolff M.W. Frommer W.B. J. Biol.

Nanosensor consists of a bacterial periplasmic glucose/galactose-binding protein, flanked with two green fluorescent protein variants, cyan (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). This construct undergoes a decrease in YFP/CFP ratio upon substrate binding and has been used successfully to estimate changes in cytosolic free glucose concentration in COS-7, CHO, HEK293, C2C12, and other cell types (5John S.A.

Determination of intracellular concentration of free glucose is of particular interest in insulin-sensitive cells (muscle and fat) to study the glucose handling under different conditions. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts are derived from mouse embryonic tissue and differentiate into adipocytes in vitro. Although 3T3-L1 adipocytes do not absolutely reflect the situation in primary adipocytes, because they exhibit different biology and physiology during maturation (7Chen X. Cushman S.W. Pannell L.K. Hess S. J. Proteome. Res. 2005; 4: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Trayhurn P. Obes. Rev. 2007; : 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) in comparison with primary adipose cells or adipocytes in vivo, 3T3-L1 adipocytes are still a useful cell type in metabolic studies due to many advantages (9Poulos S.P. Dodson M.V. Hausman G.J. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2010; 235: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). During cell differentiation, glucose transport becomes highly sensitive to insulin (10Rosen O.M. Smith C.J. Fung C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Here, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes, expressing the glucose nanosensor FLIPglu-600μ, were used to dynamically monitor intracellular glucose responses to varying external glucose concentrations and insulin. Sympathetic nervous system activity has an important role in the regulation of energy metabolism, including energy expenditure and lipolysis (14Lafontan M. Bousquet-Melou A. Galitzky J. Barbe P.

Adrenaline stimulates cAMP production and activation of PKA, which activates glycogen phosphorylase and stimulates glycogen breakdown and accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate (15Jensen J. Dahl H.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 35: 145-154PubMed Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, adrenaline-stimulated accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate inhibits hexokinase and free glucose accumulates (16Aslesen R. Jensen J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E448-E456PubMed Google Scholar). However, the intracellular glucose concentration after adrenaline action has not been examined yet. Our results show that during differentiation from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes, the intracellular free glucose concentration decreases. Insulin significantly increased cytosolic glucose in adipocytes but not in fibroblasts. Furthermore, we found that adrenaline increased cytosolic glucose concentration in fibroblasts, but not in adipocytes. Our results provide new insights into the cytosolic glucose levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes during differentiation.

Sorbitol (d-glucitol) was obtained from Calbiochem. Insulin was purchased from Novo Nordisk (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). NaCl, NaOH, and isopropyl alcohol were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). CaCl2 × 6H2O was obtained from Riedel De Haen (Seelze-Hannover, Germany). MgCl2 was purchased from Kemika (Zagreb, Croatia). Anti-β2-adrenergic receptor and anti-GLUT4 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and light antifade kit were purchased from Invitrogen, Molecular Probes. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown in DMEM containing 10% CS, as described previously (17Garcia de Herreros A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19994-19999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were seeded into tissue culture flasks (25 ml) and allowed to grow to 50–80% confluency to maintain fibroblast phenotype or allowed to grow to absolute confluency for the differentiation procedure, respectively. Differentiation was induced with DMEM containing 10% CS, 0.25 mm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 174 nm insulin for 2 days (time 0 to day 2). After that, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% CS and 174 nm insulin for the following 2 days (days 2–4). On day 6, most of the cells were differentiated (judged from their accumulation of lipid droplets) and were transferred to DMEM (with 1000 mg/liter glucose) containing 10% CS. Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Experiments were performed 2–6 days after cell preparation. 3T3-L1 cells kept at subconfluent density and not exposed to differentiation medium were termed fibroblasts. After the completed differentiation procedure, 3T3-L1 cells that exhibited lipid droplets in the cytoplasm were termed adipocytes; the subpopulation of cells that was exposed to the differentiation medium and expressed the glucose transporter GLUT4 (data not shown) but had no lipid droplets was termed preadipocytes. The bath solution for cell imaging consisted of (in mm) 131.8 NaCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES/NaOH, 0.5 NaH2PO4, 5 NaHCO3 (pH 7.2). Glucose and sorbitol were added to this solution at various concentrations. Extracellular solutions with various glucose concentrations were superfused directly over the cells using a gravity-fed eight-way superfusion device with electrically controlled solenoid valves (Warner Instruments, VC-8 valve controller, Hamden, CT). A constant volume of extracellular solution within the recording chamber was maintained using a vacuum pump. Superfusion had a flow rate between 5 and 10 ml/min. 3T3-L1 cells expressing the glucose sensor were permeabilized by using β-escin (100 μm for 20–30 s (5John S.A. Ottolia M. Weiss J.N. Ribalet B. Pflugers. Arch. 2008; 456: 307-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)) to estimate the intracellular glucose level and confirm the activity of the FLIPglu-600μ sensor. The cell membrane permeabilization was established when application and removal of outside glucose caused almost instantaneous change in YFP/CFP ratio. The bath solution was similar to that used for experimental recordings except for Ca2+ being omitted from the milieu, and in some experiments, the bath solution for recordings during cell permeabilization consisted of (in mm) 145 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES/KOH, 10 d-glucose (pH 7.2) to prove no difference in the response between the potassium-based and sodium-based superfusion medium. To identify the expression of β2-adrenergic receptors and GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes, the primary rabbit anti-β2-adrenergic receptor and rabbit anti-GLUT4 antibodies (Abcam) were used and marked with secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 546 (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes). 3T3-L1 cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, and then incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Nonspecific staining was reduced by incubating cells in blocking buffer containing 3% BSA and 10% goat serum in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were stained with primary antibody (diluted 1:100 and 1:200) in 3% BSA in PBS at 37 °C for 2 h and secondary antibody (diluted 1:600) in 3% BSA in PBS and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, they were mounted using the light antifade kit (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes). Fluorescence and transmitted light images of immunostained 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope through a planapochromatic oil immersion objective (×63, numerical aperture (NA) = 1.4), excited by the 543 nm helium-neon laser line. Plasmid DNA (FLIPglu-600μ) was extracted from Escherichia coli DH5α and purified using a commercially available protocol, the PureYield plasmid miniprep system (Promega). Plasmid was introduced into 3T3-L1 cells by using the Cell Line Nucleofector kit L (for Nucleofector II, Amaxa). Briefly, after trypsinization and centrifugation of the cell suspension, the pellet (1 × 106 to 5 × 106 cells) was resuspended in 100 μl of supplemented Nucleofector Solution L and mixed with 3–5 μg of plasmid DNA. After nucleofection and centrifugation of the cell suspension, the cell pellet was resuspended in cell culture medium. Cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Imaging was performed 24–48 h after nucleofection using a fluorescence microscope Zeiss Axiovert 135 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a Till photonics system and a CCD camera. Dual emission intensity ratios were recorded using monochromator Polychrome IV (Till Photonics, Gräfeling, Germany) with 436 nm/10 nm excitation and two emission filters (465 nm for CFP and 535 nm for YFP) and neutral density filter (optical density = 0.6). YFP and CFP images were acquired simultaneously using a Dual View image splitter (Optical Insights, Tucson, AZ). For analysis, background light intensity was subtracted from the individual YFP and CFP emission. Images of fluorescent 3T3-L1 cells were acquired through a water immersion objective C-Apochromat (×63, numerical aperture (NA) = 1.2) at intervals of 10 or 20 s. Exposure time was 700 ms. FRET was determined as the YFP/CFP emission intensity ratio. Ratio changes (ΔR) were calculated as the difference between average ratios during superfusion with glucose-free medium and superfusion with glucose medium. Intracellular glucose concentrations at respective extracellular glucose were calculated using Equations 1 and 2. The minimum ΔR (ΔRmin) at the complete absence of glucose was measured between two superfusions with glucose-free medium, and the maximum ΔR (ΔRmax), at saturation with glucose, was measured after permeabilization with β-escin (100 μm) at 10 mm extracellular glucose.S[Glc]extra=(ΔR[Glc]extra−ΔRmin)/(ΔRmax−ΔRmin)(Eq.1) [Glc]intra=(Kd×S[Glc]extra)/(1−S[Glc]extra)(Eq.2) where [Glc]extra represents extracellular glucose concentration, S[Glc]extra is the normalized value of ΔR at certain extracellular glucose concentrations, and Kd is the glucose binding affinity of FLIPglu-600μ and was determined in vitro to be 0.589 mm (6Fehr M. Lalonde S. Lager I. Wolff M.W. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19127-19133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, statistics are in the format of mean ± S.E. Differences between two samples were tested by Student's t test. If the normality test failed, we used a Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Differences between three or more samples and data with two independent variables were tested by ANOVA analysis, as indicated, and tested post hoc by the Holm-Sidak method when appropriate. If variances of samples were not equal, we used ANOVA on ranks and tested post hoc by the Dunn's method when appropriate. Regression analysis was carried out by standard techniques (Sigma Plot software; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). 3T3-L1 cells were nucleofected with the low affinity glucose nanosensor FLIPglu-600μ, which was transiently expressed in the cytosol (Fig. 1A, right). To study and quantify changes in cytosolic glucose due to different concentrations of extracellular glucose supply, the YFP/CFP ratio of the nanosensor was recorded. Fig. 1B shows a representative recording of the average YFP/CFP ratio of an entire cell in an adipocyte. The addition of 7.5 mm extracellular glucose induced a decrease in YFP/CFP ratio due to accumulation of free glucose in cytosol. Upon removal of extracellular glucose, the YFP/CFP ratio returned to its original value, indicating utilization and clearance of cytosolic glucose. During this process, the delta ratio (ΔR) was a measure for changes in cytosolic free glucose concentration. Fig. 1B, right panel, shows pseudocolored cell images of the YFP/CFP ratio at low (upper image) and at high (7.5 mm, lower image) extracellular glucose concentrations. To examine the dynamics of changes in the YFP/CFP ratio due to external glucose supply, cells were superfused with increasing concentrations of extracellular glucose alternating with glucose-free superfusions (Fig. 2). The data of the YFP/CFP ratio changes were compared among three groups of 3T3-L1 cells: fibroblasts, preadipocytes, and adipocytes (see “Experimental Procedures”). The transfection efficiency of FLIPglu-600μ was 6.4% in fibroblasts and 1.4 and 2.5% in preadipocytes and adipocytes, respectively. Interestingly, in many transfected cells, the nanosensor did not respond to alternating extracellular glucose concentrations (Fig. 2D). To further study this phenomenon, we counted responsive and unresponsive cells to alternating extracellular glucose concentrations for each of the three cell groups and calculated the corresponding percentages (Table 1). Glucose nanosensor in fibroblasts and preadipocytes responded in about half (56 and 45%, respectively) of cells examined, whereas in adipocytes, the responsiveness was only 14%. In all three cell groups (Fig. 2, A–C), a stepwise increment of external glucose concentration led to an increasing delta ratio in responsive cells. The maximal average delta ratio of adipocytes (Fig. 2C) was lower than in fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). In 86% of adipocytes, no YFP/CFP ratio change was observed upon the addition and removal of extracellular glucose (Fig. 2D).TABLE 1Responsiveness (in percentages) to extracellular glucose in three 3T3-L1 cell groupsn% of responsive cells% of unresponsive cellsFibroblasts3256.343.7Preadipocytes10945.055.0Adipocytes13314.385.7 Open table in a new tab To test whether the non-responsive cells express an active glucose nanosensor, we permeabilized the cell membrane of 3T3-L1 cells with β-escin (100 μm) to facilitate glucose entry into the cell (18Gruber K. Hein I. von Bruchhausen F. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1971; 271: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). After permeabilization of non-responsive cells, the addition and removal of extracellular glucose resulted in an almost instantaneous change in YFP/CFP ratio (Fig. 3A), indicating that the lack of response was not due to an inactive glucose nanosensor. In addition, normally responsive cells exhibited an increase in delta ratio after membrane permeabilization in comparison with the delta ratio before membrane permeabilization (Fig. 3B). Exposure of fibroblasts to extracellular glucose (10 mm) resulted in the average delta ratio of 0.105 ± 0.007 (n = 11), whereas after membrane permeabilization, the average ΔR increased to 0.125 ± 0.013 (n = 6; Fig. 3C, black columns) which was, however, not significantly higher. In adipocytes, the average delta ratio at 10 mm extracellular glucose was significantly lower (0.060 ± 0.008; n = 8) when compared with fibroblasts (Fig. 3C, p < 0.01, two-way ANOVA). However, after membrane permeabilization with β-escin, the delta ratio in adipocytes increased significantly to 0.118 ± 0.007 (n = 9; p < 0.001, Fig. 3C, white columns). Comparisons of the rates of the YFP/CFP ratio changes after application of β-escin show no significant differences in the rate of glucose load (dR/dt) between adipocytes and fibroblasts (data not shown). To verify the activity of nanosensor in the cytosolic, potassium-rich environment, we used a potassium-based superfusion medium during the cell permeabilization with β-escin. The results were similar (data not shown) to that in which the sodium-based medium was used, confirming that under both conditions, the nanosensor was operational. To further test whether the activity of hexokinase significantly contributes to the non-responsiveness of adipocytes, we treated cells with the glycolytic inhibitor iodoacetate (IAA). IAA selectively blocks the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which leads to accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate and thus inhibition of hexokinase. After prolonged exposure of non-responsive cells to IAA (100 μm), cells still did not respond to increased extracellular glucose concentration (n = 4, Fig. 3C). We plotted the delta ratios obtained at different external glucose concentrations; the curves were determined by non-linear regression (Fig. 4A). In all three cell groups, delta ratios increased with increasing extracellular glucose concentration until saturation was reached above 5 mm external glucose. Statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA) showed that delta ratios obtained upon the addition of extracellular glucose in adipocytes (Fig. 4A, filled triangles) are significantly smaller when compared with both fibroblasts (Fig. 4A, filled symbols) and preadipocytes (Fig. 4A, filled squares) at a concentration of 5 mm (p < 0.001) and when compared with fibroblasts at a concentration of 10 mm (p < 0.05), respectively. There were no significant differences between delta ratios of fibroblasts and preadipocytes. At 5 mm extracellular glucose, insulin was applied to fibroblasts and to adipocytes, respectively. Although there was no particular effect of insulin on ΔR (0.111 ± 0.005 before and 0.113 ± 0.005 after insulin stimulation) in fibroblasts (Fig. 4A, gray circle), there was, however, a significantly higher ΔR obtained after insulin stimulation (0.088 ± 0.017) in adipocytes (Fig. 4A, gray triangle) when compared with non-stimulated conditions (0.055 ± 0.005; p < 0.05). In Fig. 4A, open symbols denote delta ratio in cells with no apparent response to extracellular glucose. To estimate the intracellular glucose concentrations at different extracellular glucose supply, we used Equations 1 and 2. ΔRmin was measured during two superfusions with glucose-free medium, ΔRmax was determined as the average ΔR obtained after permeabilization with β-escin, and Kd is 0.589 μm as measured in vitro (6Fehr M. Lalonde S. Lager I. Wolff M.W. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19127-19133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Results are summarized in Fig. 4B. Cytosolic glucose levels increased with increasing extracellular glucose. In fibroblasts, the cytosolic glucose concentration yielded values up to 5 mm, and in preadipocytes, the cytosolic glucose concentration yielded values up to 2.5 mm; however in adipocytes, cytosolic glucose did not exceed 1 mm. Fitting the one-site saturation ligand binding curve to the data of cytosolic glucose concentrations yielded the predicted maximal values of cytosolic glucose concentration (Fig. 4B, dashed lines): 10.23 mm for fibroblasts, 2.63 mm for preadipocytes, and 0.58 mm for adipocytes. In insulin-stimulated adipocytes (gray triangle), cytosolic glucose concentration (1.57 mm) increased by a factor of ∼4 when compared with non-stimulated adipocytes (0.44 mm), whereas in fibroblasts, the cytosolic glucose concentration did not increase significantly after insulin stimulation. Rates of glucose load and clearance were calculated as derivatives of the YFP/CFP ratio over time (dR/dt). The rate of glucose load was calculated from the time of glucose addition in extracellular solution to the time when the ratio reached a steady state (Fig. 1B, red dashed line), and the rate of glucose clearance was calculated from the beginning of superfusion with glucose-free medium to the time when the ratio reached a steady state (Fig. 1B, green dashed line). Results are summarized in Fig. 4C. We compared the rates between different external glucose supplies (one-way ANOVA). In fibroblasts (black bars), there was a significantly smaller rate of glucose load measured at 1 mm glucose when compared with 2.5 and 5 mm glucose concentrations (p < 0.01). In preadipocytes (gray bars) and in adipocytes (white bars), there were no significant differences in glucose load at different external glucose concentrations. We then compared the rates of glucose load between all three cell groups. Statistical comparison shows a significantly slower rate of glucose load in adipocytes when compared with preadipocytes at external glucose concentrations of 5 mm (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between basal and insulin-stimulated (data not shown) rates of glucose load. Fig. 4C, right panel, summarizes the rates of glucose clearance, which were normalized to the glucose concentration gradient across the plasma membrane; we have taken into account the measured values of cytosolic glucose concentrations in Fig. 4B at particular extracellular glucose levels. In fibroblasts, the rate of glucose clearance decreased with increasing glucose concentration gradient across the plasma membrane (p < 0.001 for 1 mm versus all higher concentrations). Preadipocytes show a significantly higher glucose clearance rate (p < 0.01) at 1 mm when compared with 5, 7.5, and 10 mm external glucose concentrations, respectively. Adipocytes show no significant differences of glucose clearance rate at different external glucose supply. Comparison of the glucose clearance rates between all three cell groups revealed a significantly higher rate in fibroblasts when compared with preadipocytes (p < 0.05) at 1 mm extracellular glucose concentration. Adipocytes show a significantly higher rate of glucose clearance when compared with fibroblasts and preadipocytes at 5, 7.5, and 10 mm extracellular glucose concentrations (p < 0.001). These results are consistent with the view that the rate of glucose load is slower in adipocytes than in fibroblasts and that the rate of normalized glucose clearance is higher in adipocytes than in fibroblasts. The glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose (DOG) is widely used in glucose metabolic studies as it inhibits hexokinase by the accumulation of 2-deoxyglucose phosphate (19Kletzien R.F. Perdue J.F. J. Biol.

The glucose nanosensor FLIPglu-600μ is insensitive to DOG concentrations of ∼10–30 mm, which is lower than the reported sensitivity of the FLIPglu-600μ at >100 mm (5John S.A. Ottolia M. Weiss J.N.

The rate of glucose load during the first glucose/DOG superfusion was reduced in both cell groups, likely due to competition between glucose and DOG for glucose transporters (Fig. 5B). In fibroblasts, the rate of glucose load was significantly reduced (in 10−3 arbitrary units/s) from 0.79 ± 0.14 to 0.30 ± 0.07 (p < 0.01; two-way RM ANOVA), whereas in adipocytes, the reduction was not significant,"
https://openalex.org/W2010438610,"There is an old aphorism that you wait forever for a London bus, and then two come along together. After the huge international efforts to sequence the human genome, the past 10 years have seen an explosion of data documenting human genetic variation, and we are at the tipping point for what will be an avalanche of high-quality human genomes. Within a few years, tens of thousands of human genomes will have been sequenced.

A major strand in research since the human genome sequence has been the systematic attempt to identify, annotate, and understand the functional elements in the genome. For much of this time, the collection and analysis of human variation data might have seemed to be running in parallel to the functional work, with no direct connection. But that is illusory: Data on human genetic diversity have proved to be a valuable tool in the quest to understand human biology. One example is recombination. We have learned a great deal recently about this fundamental biological process through the study of humans and, in particular, of human variation. Another is population genetics—as others have noted, human variation data offer an unparalleled opportunity to understand the forces shaping patterns of genetic diversity and to identify genomic elements under selection. But perhaps most significantly, the identification of DNA sequence variation associated with phenotypes of interest, particularly with human disease, provides the starting point on another route to understanding biological function. The growing number of examples where the path from sequence variant to function has been elucidated offers an encouraging pointer to coming progress.

Although the collection of whole-genome data from large numbers of individuals in disease studies is set to become routine, making sense of that data is not yet straightforward. There are formidable analytical challenges ahead, even in the research context. Moving this kind of information into the clinic takes the challenge to another level. Like others, I am an enthusiast for personalized medicine, but one of the biggest obstacles to the use of individual genomic information in health care will be the need for robust analytical tools for its interpretation."

Different related species of bacteriophage share only 12% similarity in pRNA sequences. The secondary structure for pRNA is conserved, however. In this study, we present evidence for self-assembly in different pRNA sequences and new measurements of the energetics for the quaternary interactions in pRNA dimers and trimers. The energetics for self-assembly in different pRNA sequences are similar despite very different sequences in the loop-loop interactions. The architecture surrounding the interlocking loops contributes to the stability of the pRNA quaternary interactions, and sequence variation outside the interlocking loops may counterbalance the changes in the loop sequences. Thus, the evolutionary divergence of pRNA sequences maintains not only conservation of function and secondary structure but also stabilities of quaternary interactions. The self-assembly of pRNA can be fine-tuned with variations in magnesium chloride, sodium chloride, temperature, and concentration. The ability to control pRNA self-assembly holds promise for the development of nanoparticle therapeutic applications for this biological molecule. The pRNA system is well suited for future studies to further understand the energetics of RNA tertiary and quaternary interactions, which can provide insight into larger biological assemblies such as viruses and biomolecular motors.

https://openalex.org/W1970554957,"Human splicing factor SF3a is a component of the mature U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) and its three subunits of 60, 66, and 120 kDa are essential for splicing in vitro and in vivo. The SF3a heterotrimer forms in the cytoplasm and enters the nucleus independently of the U2 snRNP. Here, we have analyzed domains required for in vitro interactions between the SF3a subunits. Our results indicate that the SF3a66-SF3a120 interaction is mediated by a 27-amino acid region in SF3a120 C-terminal to the second suppressor-of-white-apricot and prp21/spp91 domain and amino acids 108-210 of SF3a66. Neither of these sequences contains known structural motifs, suggesting that the interaction domains are novel. Moreover, an ∼100-amino acid region, including the SURP2 domain of SF3a120 but extending into neighboring regions, is sufficient for binding to SF3a60. Analysis of determinants for nuclear import of SF3a demonstrates that SF3a120 provides the major nuclear localization signal and SF3a60 contributes to nuclear import."
https://openalex.org/W1989314545,"The past 3 years have witnessed a series of replicable, credible, and increasingly useful genetic discoveries in autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. I cannot emphasize enough the significance of this progress. Neuropsychiatric disorders are outsized contributors to global disease burden, yet treatment development has reached a near stand-still. The problem is that the brain, with its myriad cell types and complex circuitry, represents such a difficult scientific frontier. Because genes play powerful roles in neuropsychiatric disorders, identification of causal variation could provide invaluable clues to their pathogenesis. Sadly, the genetic architecture of neuropsychiatric disorders is fiendishly complex, but unlike other areas of medicine wrestling with genetic complexity, psychiatry lacks objective phenotypic markers.

When I became director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), NIH, in 1996, I did not foresee quite how complex the genetics would prove, but did recognize that the contemporary technologies were overmatched. (I ruefully joked that I had the only institute with no low-hanging Mendelian fruit to pluck.) With expert advice, I decided that the only rational approach was to amass large collections of patient DNAs with extensive phenotype information. Some investigators resisted sharing of samples, but for most, that day has long passed. I am pleased that these NIMH collections have proven useful, albeit as only a small fraction of the needed sample sizes.

It was not, of course, the first human sequence per se that turned the tide for neuropsychiatric disorders. As for much of medicine, the associated technologies and analytic approaches (above all, the availability of ever cheaper and more accurate DNA sequencing) are proving decisive. These advances have given investigators, clinicians, and patients hope that genetics will finally yield tools that neurobiologists have dreamt of to study the brain in health and in illness.

https://openalex.org/W2025274788,"The sequencing of the human genome has been a major scientific adventure of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It has played a decisive role in the development of biomedicine and has led to numerous partnerships between researchers, clinicians, and the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.

Patient organizations have also been involved in these partnerships from the very beginning. In France, for instance, the French muscular dystrophy organization, the AFM (Association Francaise Contre les Myopathies), is a classic example. To step up the struggle against neuromuscular diseases, it created its own laboratory, Genethon, which published the first physical maps of the human genome and handed them over to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1993, as a heritage to humanity.

Numerous patient organizations concerned with rare diseases (80% of which are of genetic origin), national alliances, and a European umbrella organization (Eurordis—European Organization on Rare Diseases) have been created and have adopted and adapted this model of partnership with research and health institutions. The “Marche des Maladies Rares” (shown in the photo above) is an annual charity walk organized by the French Alliance on Rare Diseases. This collective mobilization is what led the European Union in 2009 to ask its member states to consider rare diseases a public health issue.

The fact that the complete genome sequences are now available has had effects on patient advocacy. First, from my observations in France, patient organizations have multiplied, notably because many genetic abnormalities (and not only genes) have been discovered. Second, thanks to knowledge derived from the sequencing of the complete genome, patient organizations are confronting the complexity of their diseases in their multiple, heterogeneous, and sometimes singular manifestations. As a consequence, the very definition and contours of the conditions they are concerned with sometimes become strategic elements in their self-descriptions. Third, because the same biological pathways might be involved in different conditions, patient organizations are considering cross-condition research subjects and issues.

What lessons can be learned from patient organizations' active participation in genetic and now genomic research? First and foremost, it has shown lay people's ability to engage in activities that were considered for a long time as the preserve of specialists. Second, patient organizations have made a crucial contribution to the socialization of genetic diseases. Through their involvement in research, they have fostered a strong sense of solidarity with patients whose diseases were, until recently, considered to be shameful defects that excluded them from a common humanity.

As often happens, my research endeavors yielded too much data, and I soon recognized that a dance about the human genome could be a dance about religion, capitalism, policy, race, population control, or a dozen other topics. But after exploring the subject for a year through encounters with scientists, I settled on a format that framed the surprising commonalities of art and science and ventured to use the medium of dance as a science delivery system, setting up three topics: aging, ancestry, and perfection. The dance eventually premiered in 2006 as Ferocious Beauty: Genome, a work combining live dance with video projections that capture the faces, voices, and moving bodies of some of our wonderful science collaborators.

So for me, having the genome in hand meant that scientists were ready to talk to an artist—an essential element in my ability to create this work. Amid sensationalistic speculations and Frankenstein scenarios, the geneticists, biologists, and ethicists I engaged seemed eager for a platform that would bring a personal voice, a sense of beauty and history, and a range of feeling to bear on this most human of topics. Audiences throughout North America have responded in kind: “I didn't expect it to be so emotional.” “I didn't realize how human scientists were.” “I expected to be confirmed in my hatred for science, but now I have to reconsider.” Along this path, I encountered amazing scientists pursuing knowledge with passion, creativity, and leaps of imagination that were akin to those of my own art-making colleagues. I found a commitment to embracing wide paradoxes, such as how we humans are both common and unique. I discovered both a profound interest in personal inquiry in the lab and a commitment to preparing the larger public to handle the outcome of all of this research. After 5 years of taking this dance to communities throughout North America, I have made many new friends in a field that is not so far from my own, although we have been trained to think we are separate.

K is the youngest of eight siblings. Three of her five brothers were severely developmentally delayed, with cognitive impairment and intractable behavioral disorders. No one else in their large extended family was affected. The most likely explanation for her brothers' condition was X-linked inheritance following a new mutation in their mother. Fragile X was excluded, and the critical gene had eluded detection. The region of the X-chromosome shared by the three affected brothers was 40 megabases, too long to enable prenatal diagnosis.

K despaired of having a healthy son. Then early last spring, targeted X-exome sequencing of constitutional DNA from the affected brothers revealed a nonsense mutation in a gene known to be implicated in mental retardation. The mutation had not been detectable by conventional technologies but was transparent to massively parallel sequencing. K carried the mutant allele. Armed with knowledge of the mutation, K and her husband undertook pregestational diagnosis (PGD), which involves in vitro fertilization of their egg and sperm, then genotyping of embryos via the polar bodies, and implanting a normal embryo in the mother's uterus. In experienced hands, PGD works very well. K and her husband have a healthy newborn son.

Genetics is a way of thinking. Genomics is a set of tools. If we think rigorously about genetics and use these tools well, the resolution of inherited disorders on behalf of our patients will be bounded only by our imaginations. One healthy infant at a time is not a bad way to begin.
