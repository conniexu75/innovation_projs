https://openalex.org/W2007079891,"A nuclear siting policy leading to a few, large concentrated sites, it is argued, is preferable in the long run to the present policy which could lead to many dispersed sites. Such a policy could be implemented incrementally if requirements for new nuclear generating capacity were met by adding reactors to the existing 100-odd sites. Such a concentrated nuclear siting policy would, to some extent, isolate nuclear activities while augmenting the strengths of the institutions responsible for managing them. Additionally, it would confer an element of permanence on the sites and thereby open new options for managing low level wastes and reactor decommissioning. These actions may improve the public acceptability of nuclear energy in the United States as well as lead to a more rational contained nuclear system in the long run."

It is possible that other natural satellites may also leave such rings in their wakes."

https://openalex.org/W2087156333,Dark reddish-brown spherules are common in soils of the Chesterton soil series of a high marine terrace in southern California. The spherules are concretionary in structure and are bound by ilmenite rather than by an iron-manganese complex. The spherules have been mislabeled both with respect to structure and mineralogy.

https://openalex.org/W2037007688,Observed changes in the pulsation periods of Cepheid variables can be used to place an upper limit on changes in convective efficiency in their outer layers. This limit implies changes no larger than those recently suggested as occurring in the sun.
