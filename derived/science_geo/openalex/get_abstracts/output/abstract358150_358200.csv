https://openalex.org/W2032570745,"Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have been generated from mouse and human somatic cells by introducing Oct3/4 and Sox2 with either Klf4 and c-Myc or Nanog and Lin28 using retroviruses or lentiviruses. Patient-specific iPS cells could be useful in drug discovery and regenerative medicine. However, viral integration into the host genome increases the risk of tumorigenicity. Here, we report the generation of mouse iPS cells without viral vectors. Repeated transfection of two expression plasmids, one containing the complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4 and the other containing the c-Myc cDNA, into mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in iPS cells without evidence of plasmid integration, which produced teratomas when transplanted into mice and contributed to adult chimeras. The production of virus-free iPS cells, albeit from embryonic fibroblasts, addresses a critical safety concern for potential use of iPS cells in regenerative medicine."

https://openalex.org/W2031312855,"A long-standing goal of biology is to map the behavior of all cells during vertebrate embryogenesis. We developed digital scanned laser light sheet fluorescence microscopy and recorded nuclei localization and movement in entire wild-type and mutant zebrafish embryos over the first 24 hours of development. Multiview in vivo imaging at 1.5 billion voxels per minute provides “digital embryos,” that is, comprehensive databases of cell positions, divisions, and migratory tracks. Our analysis of global cell division patterns reveals a maternally defined initial morphodynamic symmetry break, which identifies the embryonic body axis. We further derive a model of germ layer formation and show that the mesendoderm forms from one-third of the embryo's cells in a single event. Our digital embryos, with 55 million nucleus entries, are provided as a resource."

Here, we present a comprehensive assessment of the conservation status and distribution of the world's mammals. Data, compiled by 1700+ experts, cover all 5487 species, including marine mammals. Global macroecological patterns are very different for land and marine species but suggest common mechanisms driving diversity and endemism across systems. Compared with land species, threat levels are higher among marine mammals, driven by different processes (accidental mortality and pollution, rather than habitat loss), and are spatially distinct (peaking in northern oceans, rather than in Southeast Asia). Marine mammals are also disproportionately poorly known. These data are made freely available to support further scientific developments and conservation action."

The structure and composition of core-shell Rh 0.5 Pd 0.5 and Pt 0.5 Pd 0.5 nanoparticle catalysts were studied in situ, during oxidizing, reducing, and catalytic reactions involving NO, O 2 , CO, and H 2 by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy at near-ambient pressure. The Rh 0.5 Pd 0.5 nanoparticles underwent dramatic and reversible changes in composition and chemical state in response to oxidizing or reducing conditions. In contrast, no substantial segregation of Pd or Pt atoms was found in Pt 0.5 Pd 0.5 nanoparticles. The different behaviors in restructuring and chemical response of Rh 0.5 Pd 0.5 and Pt 0.5 Pd 0.5 nanoparticle catalysts under the same reaction conditions illustrates the flexibility and tunability of the structure of bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts during catalytic reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2056740995,"The ability of gecko lizards to adhere to a vertical solid surface comes from their remarkable feet with aligned microscopic elastic hairs. By using carbon nanotube arrays that are dominated by a straight body segment but with curly entangled top, we have created gecko-foot-mimetic dry adhesives that show macroscopic adhesive forces of approximately 100 newtons per square centimeter, almost 10 times that of a gecko foot, and a much stronger shear adhesion force than the normal adhesion force, to ensure strong binding along the shear direction and easy lifting in the normal direction. This anisotropic force distribution is due to the shear-induced alignments of the curly segments of the nanotubes. The mimetic adhesives can be alternatively binding-on and lifting-off over various substrates for simulating the walking of a living gecko."
https://openalex.org/W2096523843,"This paper demonstrates that teamwork in science increasingly spans university boundaries, a dramatic shift in knowledge production that generalizes across virtually all fields of science, engineering, and social science. Moreover, elite universities play a dominant role in this shift. By examining 4.2 million papers published over three decades, we found that multi-university collaborations (i) are the fastest growing type of authorship structure, (ii) produce the highest-impact papers when they include a top-tier university, and (iii) are increasingly stratified by in-group university rank. Despite the rising frequency of research that crosses university boundaries, the intensification of social stratification in multi-university collaborations suggests a concentration of the production of scientific knowledge in fewer rather than more centers of high-impact science."
https://openalex.org/W1990297263,"Generation of long-term antibody-mediated immunity depends on the germinal centre reaction, which requires cooperation between antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes. In human X-linked lymphoproliferative disease and its gene-targeted mouse model, loss-of-function mutations in signalling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein (SAP, encoded by SH2D1a) cause a profound defect in germinal centre formation by an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, using two-photon intravital imaging, we show that SAP deficiency selectively impairs the ability of CD4+ T cells to stably interact with cognate B cells but not antigen-presenting dendritic cells. This selective defect results in a failure of antigen-specific B cells to receive adequate levels of contact-dependent T-cell help to expand normally, despite Sap-/- T cells exhibiting the known characteristics of otherwise competent helper T cells. Furthermore, the lack of stable interactions with B cells renders Sap-/- T cells unable to be efficiently recruited to and retained in a nascent germinal centre to sustain the germinal centre reaction. These results offer an explanation for the germinal centre defect due to SAP deficiency and provide new insights into the bi-directional communication between cognate T and B cells in vivo. X-linked lymphoproliferative disease is a fatal immunodeficiency caused by defects in the lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein, SAP. Individuals lacking a functional SAP — and the equivalent gene-targeted mouse model — do not generate germinal centres, areas in the lymph nodes that are the sites of antibody affinity maturation. Using two-photon intravital imaging, a type of fluorescence microscopy that can track labelled cells within the tissues, Hai Qi et al. show that SAP-deficient T cells are unable to interact with and provide help to antigen-specific B cells, and are not recruited into germinal centres. This work helps explain why patients lacking SAP have difficulties making antibodies and provides insights into the intercellular communication between T cells and B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2136934181,"High-temperature interface superconductivity, confined to nanometre-size interfaces between two non-superconducting materials, has been long sought-after. Theorists speculated about it for forty years, but it has been elusive because of extreme demands on interface perfection and materials parameters. Gozar et al. now report the discovery of interface superconductivity between two non-superconducting cuprates — an insulator (La2CuO4) and a metal (La1.55Sr0.45CuO4). The critical tempeature (Tc) in bilayers is about 15 K or 30 K, depending on the layering sequence. This highly robust phenomenon is confined to within 2 or 3 nanometres of the interface, and if the bilayer is exposed to ozone, Tc rises to over 50 K. The realization of high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity confined to nanometre-sized interfaces has been a long-standing goal because of potential applications1,2 and the opportunity to study quantum phenomena in reduced dimensions3,4. This has been, however, a challenging target: in conventional metals, the high electron density restricts interface effects (such as carrier depletion or accumulation) to a region much narrower than the coherence length, which is the scale necessary for superconductivity to occur. By contrast, in copper oxides the carrier density is low whereas Tc is high and the coherence length very short, which provides an opportunity—but at a price: the interface must be atomically perfect. Here we report superconductivity in bilayers consisting of an insulator (La2CuO4) and a metal (La1.55Sr0.45CuO4), neither of which is superconducting in isolation. In these bilayers, Tc is either ∼15 K or ∼30 K, depending on the layering sequence. This highly robust phenomenon is confined within 2–3 nm of the interface. If such a bilayer is exposed to ozone, Tc exceeds 50 K, and this enhanced superconductivity is also shown to originate from an interface layer about 1–2 unit cells thick. Enhancement of Tc in bilayer systems was observed previously5 but the essential role of the interface was not recognized at the time."
https://openalex.org/W1986522418,"Oceanic detachment faults are associated with one of two contrasting modes of accretion at mid-ocean ridges and can accommodate extension for millions of years. The main mode of accretion has been thought to be symmetrical, dominated by magmatic processes with subsidiary high-angle faulting and the formation of abyssal hills on both flanks. The other is asymmetrical involving active detachment faults along at least one ridge flank. Escartin et al. present an examination of approximately 2,500 km of the mid-Atlantic ridge that reveals that asymmetrical accretion surprisingly occurs along half of the studied ridge section. Much of the variability in seafloor morphology, seismicity and basalt chemistry found along slow-spreading ridges may thus be attributed to the frequent involvement of detachment faults in oceanic lithospheric accretion. The formation of oceanic detachment faults is well established from inactive, corrugated fault planes exposed on sea floor formed along ridges spreading at less than 80 km Myr–1 (refs 1–4). These faults can accommodate extension for up to 1–3 Myr (ref. 5), and are associated with one of the two contrasting modes of accretion operating along the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The first mode is asymmetrical accretion involving an active detachment fault6 along one ridge flank. The second mode is the well-known symmetrical accretion, dominated by magmatic processes with subsidiary high-angle faulting and the formation of abyssal hills on both flanks. Here we present an examination of ∼2,500 km of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between 12.5 and 35° N, which reveals asymmetrical accretion along almost half of the ridge. Hydrothermal activity identified so far in the study region is closely associated with asymmetrical accretion, which also shows high levels of near-continuous hydroacoustically and teleseismically recorded seismicity. Increased seismicity is probably generated along detachment faults that accommodate a sizeable proportion of the total plate separation. In contrast, symmetrical segments have lower levels of seismicity, which occurs primarily at segment ends. Basalts erupted along asymmetrical segments have compositions that are consistent with crystallization at higher pressures than basalts from symmetrical segments, and with lower extents of partial melting of the mantle. Both seismic evidence and geochemical evidence indicate that the axial lithosphere is thicker and colder at asymmetrical sections of the ridge, either because associated hydrothermal circulation efficiently penetrates to greater depths or because the rising mantle is cooler. We suggest that much of the variability in sea-floor morphology, seismicity and basalt chemistry found along slow-spreading ridges can be thus attributed to the frequent involvement of detachment faults in oceanic lithospheric accretion."

https://openalex.org/W2068518990,"Polyploidy, frequently termed ""whole genome duplication"", is a major force in the evolution of many eukaryotes. Indeed, most angiosperm species have undergone at least one round of polyploidy in their evolutionary history. Despite enormous progress in our understanding of many aspects of polyploidy, we essentially have no information about the role of chromosome divergence in the establishment of young polyploid populations. Here we investigate synthetic lines and natural populations of two recently and recurrently formed allotetraploids Tragopogon mirus and T. miscellus (formed within the past 80 years) to assess the role of aberrant meiosis in generating chromosomal/genomic diversity. That diversity is likely important in the formation, establishment and survival of polyploid populations and species.Applications of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to natural populations of T. mirus and T. miscellus suggest that chromosomal rearrangements and other chromosomal changes are common in both allotetraploids. We detected extensive chromosomal polymorphism between individuals and populations, including (i) plants monosomic and trisomic for particular chromosomes (perhaps indicating compensatory trisomy), (ii) intergenomic translocations and (iii) variable sizes and expression patterns of individual ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci. We even observed karyotypic variation among sibling plants. Significantly, translocations, chromosome loss, and meiotic irregularities, including quadrivalent formation, were observed in synthetic (S(0) and S(1) generations) polyploid lines. Our results not only provide a mechanism for chromosomal variation in natural populations, but also indicate that chromosomal changes occur rapidly following polyploidisation.These data shed new light on previous analyses of genome and transcriptome structures in de novo and establishing polyploid species. Crucially our results highlight the necessity of studying karyotypes in young (<150 years old) polyploid species and synthetic polyploids that resemble natural species. The data also provide insight into the mechanisms that perturb inheritance patterns of genetic markers in synthetic polyploids and populations of young natural polyploid species."
https://openalex.org/W2057147389,"Much of what we know about galaxies comes from observations of those that are cosmologically close to us. It is much harder to find out what is going on in the remote star-forming regions of the Universe, where faintness and small angular size mean that only the overall properties of a galaxy are normally observable. But adaptive optics is beginning to bring the interiors of young galaxies, at redshifts equivalent to two to three billion years after the Big Bang, into the observable range. Now by combining adaptive optics with gravitational lensing, where light from a distant galaxy is magnified by the pull of a massive object on the way to Earth, Stark et al. have observed J21352–0102, a typical star-forming galaxy down to a linear resolution of about 100 parsecs. They find a well-ordered compact source in which molecular gas is being converted efficiently into stars, likely to result in a spheroidal bulge similar to those seen in spiral galaxies at the present day. Recent studies of galaxies ∼2–3 Gyr after the Big Bang have revealed large, rotating disks, similar to those of galaxies today1,2. The existence of well-ordered rotation in galaxies during this peak epoch of cosmic star formation indicates that gas accretion is likely to be the dominant mode by which galaxies grow, because major mergers of galaxies would completely disrupt the observed velocity fields. But poor spatial resolution and sensitivity have hampered this interpretation; such studies have been limited to the largest and most luminous galaxies, which may have fundamentally different modes of assembly from those of more typical galaxies (which are thought to grow into the spheroidal components at the centres of galaxies similar to the Milky Way). Here we report observations of a typical star-forming galaxy at z = 3.07, with a linear resolution of ∼100 parsecs. We find a well-ordered compact source in which molecular gas is being converted efficiently into stars, likely to be assembling a spheroidal bulge similar to those seen in spiral galaxies at the present day. The presence of undisrupted rotation may indicate that galaxies such as the Milky Way gain much of their mass by accretion rather than major mergers."
https://openalex.org/W2044968876,"The high photostability of DNA is commonly attributed to efficient radiationless electronic relaxation processes. We used femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to reveal that the ensuing dynamics are strongly dependent on base sequence and are also affected by higher-order structure. Excited electronic state lifetimes in dG-doped d(A) 20 single-stranded DNA and dG·dC-doped d(A) 20 ·d(T) 20 double-stranded DNA decrease sharply with the substitution of only a few bases. In duplexes containing d(AGA)·d(TCT) or d(AG)·d(TC) repeats, deactivation of the fluorescing states occurs on the subpicosecond time scale, but the excited-state lifetimes increase again in extended d(G) runs. The results point at more complex and molecule-specific photodynamics in native DNA than may be evident in simpler model systems."
https://openalex.org/W1987755014,"Selective modulation of cell function by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation is highly desirable for basic research and therapy but difficult to achieve. We present a novel strategy toward this goal using muscarinic acetylcholine receptors as a model. The five subtypes bind their physiological transmitter in the highly conserved orthosteric site within the transmembrane domains of the receptors. Orthosteric muscarinic activators have no binding selectivity and poor signaling specificity. There is a less well conserved allosteric site at the extracellular entrance of the binding pocket. To gain subtype-selective receptor activation, we synthesized two hybrids fusing a highly potent oxotremorine-like orthosteric activator with M(2)-selective bis(ammonio)alkane-type allosteric fragments. Radioligand binding in wild-type and mutant receptors supplemented by receptor docking simulations proved M(2) selective and true allosteric/orthosteric binding. G protein activation measurements using orthosteric and allosteric blockers identified the orthosteric part of the hybrid to engender receptor activation. Hybrid-induced dynamic mass redistribution in CHO-hM(2) cells disclosed pathway-specific signaling. Selective receptor activation (M(2)>M(1)>M(3)) was verified in living tissue preparations. As allosteric sites are increasingly recognized on GPCRs, the dualsteric concept of GPCR targeting represents a new avenue toward potent agonists for selective receptor and signaling pathway activation."
https://openalex.org/W1994478348,"The physical processes generating seismicity within volcanic edifices are highly complex and not fully understood. We report results from a laboratory experiment in which basalt from Mount Etna volcano (Italy) was deformed and fractured. The experiment was monitored with an array of transducers around the sample to permit full-waveform capture, location, and analysis of microseismic events. Rapid post-failure decompression of the water-filled pore volume and damage zone triggered many low-frequency events, analogous to volcanic long-period seismicity. The low frequencies were associated with pore fluid decompression and were located in the damage zone in the fractured sample; these events exhibited a weak component of shear (double-couple) slip, consistent with fluid-driven events occurring beneath active volcanoes."
https://openalex.org/W2036188703,"Considerable experimental evidence shows that functional cerebral asymmetries are widespread in animals. Activity of the right cerebral hemisphere has been associated with responses to novel stimuli and the expression of intense emotions, such as aggression, escape behaviour and fear. The left hemisphere uses learned patterns and responds to familiar stimuli. Although such lateralization has been studied mainly for visual responses, there is evidence in primates that auditory perception is lateralized and that vocal communication depends on differential processing by the hemispheres. The aim of the present work was to investigate whether dogs use different hemispheres to process different acoustic stimuli by presenting them with playbacks of a thunderstorm and their species-typical vocalizations. The results revealed that dogs usually process their species-typical vocalizations using the left hemisphere and the thunderstorm sounds using the right hemisphere. Nevertheless, conspecific vocalizations are not always processed by the left hemisphere, since the right hemisphere is used for processing vocalizations when they elicit intense emotion, including fear. These findings suggest that the specialisation of the left hemisphere for intraspecific communication is more ancient that previously thought, and so is specialisation of the right hemisphere for intense emotions."
https://openalex.org/W2102081792,"Volcanic eruptions are episodic despite being supplied by melt at a nearly constant rate. We used histories of magma efflux and surface deformation to geodetically image magma transfer within the deep crustal plumbing of the Soufrière Hills volcano on Montserrat, West Indies. For three cycles of effusion followed by discrete pauses, supply of the system from the deep crust and mantle was continuous. During periods of reinitiated high surface efflux, magma rose quickly and synchronously from a deflating mid-crustal reservoir (at about 12 kilometers) augmented from depth. During repose, the lower reservoir refilled from the deep supply, with only minor discharge transiting the upper chamber to surface. These observations are consistent with a model involving the continuous supply of magma from the deep crust and mantle into a voluminous and compliant mid-crustal reservoir, episodically valved below a shallow reservoir (at about 6 kilometers)."

We have solved the GDNF2·GFRα12 complex structure at 2.35 Å resolution in the presence of a heparin mimic, sucrose octasulfate. The structure of our GDNF2·GFRα12 complex and the previously published artemin2·GFRα32 complex are unlike in three ways. First, we have experimentally identified residues that differ in the ligand-GFRα interface between the two structures, in particular ones that buttress the key conserved ArgGFRα-Gluligand-ArgGFRα interaction. Second, the flexible GDNF ligand “finger” loops fit differently into the GFRαs, which are rigid. Third, and we believe most importantly, the quaternary structure of the two tetramers is dissimilar, because the angle between the two GDNF monomers is different. This suggests that the RET-RET interaction differs in different ligand2-co-receptor2-RET2 heterohexamer complexes. Consistent with this, we showed that GDNF2·GFRα12 and artemin2·GFRα32 signal differently in a mitogen-activated protein kinase assay. Furthermore, we have shown by mutagenesis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of RET phosphorylation that RET probably interacts with GFRα1 residues Arg-190, Lys-194, Arg-197, Gln-198, Lys-202, Arg-257, Arg-259, Glu-323, and Asp-324 upon both domains 2 and 3.

Biol. 2006; 2: 636-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have recently shown that ARTN first binds to a monomer of GFRα3, followed by sequential recruitment of one RET molecule and then additional molecules of GFRα3 and RET. GDNF in complex with GFRα1 can also signal through the neural cell adhesion molecule independent of RET (19.Paratcha G. Ledda F. Ibáñez C.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), and recent studies suggest that the GDNF2·GFRα12 complex can also act as an adhesin, mediating cell-cell interactions (20.Ledda F. Paratcha G. Sandoval-Guzmán T. Ibáñez C.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the N terminus of GDNF has been shown to bind heparin (21.Alfano I. Vora P. Mummery R.S. Mulloy B. Rider C.C. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Understanding the structure of the GDNF2·GFRα12 complex may thus give insight into the various ways in which GDNF is involved in development and maintenance of neuronal and other cells. We present here the crystal structure of the GDNF2·GFRα12 complex in the presence of a heparin mimic, sucrose octasulfate (SOS). Structural, mutagenesis, and biochemical studies have allowed us to understand the structural basis for ligand binding specificity. We have been able to identify the putative RET-binding site on GFRα1 and to understand the structural basis for differential GFL signaling. Finally, our structure also suggests how GDNF2-GFRα12 interactions might lead to cell-cell adhesion and RET-independent signaling. Expression and Purification of the GDNF2·GFRα12 Complex—The numbering of the amino acid residues of rat GFRα1 refers to SwissProt accession number Q62997. Primers included a His6 tag, followed by a thrombin cleavage site for the truncated rat GFRα1 construct, residues 145-425. We did not add His6 tag to the mature human GDNF construct (GenBank™ ID AH003115, excluding the 77-residue preprosequence), numbered 1-134. We used human, not rat, GDNF, since in the 34-134 region there are just six changes, the only nonconservative one being Met → Thr at residue 78. Both constructs were cloned into baculovirus vector pK503.9 (22.Keinänen K. Jouppila A. Kuusinen A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a pFastBac derivative (Invitrogen), which added a FLAG tag and an insect cell secretion signal sequence to the N terminus. High titer GDNF and GFRα1 baculovirus stocks grown in Sf9 cells were used at a 1:1 ratio to infect Tn5 cells for the co-expression of the protein complex. Cells were grown in serum-free HyQ-SFX medium (HyClone) supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma) at +27 °C. Three days after co-infection, the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation to remove cellular material. Tangential flow concentration was used to concentrate the supernatant and to change the buffer to phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The GDNF2·GFRα12 complex was purified by adding Ni2+-resin (Ni2+-charged chelating Sepharose; GE Healthcare) to the concentrated supernatant in batch. After a 45-min incubation at +4 °C, the resin was washed with phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of 10 mm imidazole, and the complex was eluted with 500 mm imidazole in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0. To remove the His tag, the buffer was adjusted to phosphate-buffered saline with spin concentrators, and the complex was incubated overnight at room temperature with 10 units of thrombin (GE Healthcare)/mg of the complex. Two millimolar SOS was added to the protein solution before gel filtration. Finally, the complex was purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) column in HEPES-buffered (pH 7.5) 0.3 m NaCl and visualized on SDS-PAGE to check that a complex had formed (Fig. 1A). Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mutant clones of GFRα1 were constructed using the QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis protocol. The constructs were transformed into DH5α cells, and the transformed cells were selected on LB/ampicillin agar plates. The mutated plasmids were used for cloning into baculovirus. All clones were sequenced to ensure that no undesired mutations were introduced during PCR. RET Activation and ELISA—RET phosphorylation assays were done in MG87RET cells, derived from the mouse NIH 3T3 cells, which are stably transfected with RET but do not express GFRα1 (23.Eketjäll S. Fainzilber M. Murray-Rust J. Ibáñez C.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5901-5910Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). MG87RET cells were starved for 4 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C and subsequently stimulated for 60 min at 37 °C by adding 1 μg/ml soluble wild-type GFRα1 D23C or mutant GFRα1 D23C (Fig. 1B) with or without 100 ng/ml GDNF. After lysis with lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, Complete Mini protease inhibitor from Roche Applied Science), the lysates were centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge, at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the nuclei. The cleared lysates were applied to a 96-well plate (OptiPlate 96 F HB, Black; Wallac), which had been previously coated with 0.5 μg/ml RET C-20 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, and the plate was incubated at +4 °C for 1 h. Phosphorylated RET was detected using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10; 1:1000 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:3000 dilution; DAKO A/S), and the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Femto ELISA ECL kit; Pierce). All washes between the incubations were done with the same washing buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100). Signal detection was done using a MicroBeta luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The ELISA-based assay was more sensitive and had a much wider dynamic range than our previous Western blot assay (14.Leppänen V.-M. Bespalov M.M. Runeberg-Roos P. Puurand ü. Merits A. Saarma M. Goldman A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), because GFRα1 was separately expressed in baculovirus/insect cells and was added as a soluble component. MAPK Activity Assay—MG87RET cells were transfected with the MAPK activation detection system (Gal4-ELK plasmid and G4-Luc plasmid (6.Baloh R.H. Tansey M.G. Lampe P.A. Fahrner T.J. Enomoto H. Simburger K.S. Leitner M.L. Araki T. Johnson Jr., E.M. Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1291-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), a kind gift of Prof. J. Milbrandt) and plasmids expressing either rat GFRα1 or human GFRα3 (also from Prof. J. Milbrandt). Stably transfected cells were selected in the presence of 750 and 500 μg of Geneticin/ml of growth medium, respectively. After selection, cells were cultivated in the culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, normocin, 2 μg/ml puromycin, 500 μg/ml Geneticin, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). Six hours before the assay, cells were plated on 96-well plates at a cell density of 400,000 cells/ml. GDNF or ARTN was diluted in growth medium without selective antibiotics to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml and added to the cells for varying lengths of time. After incubation with the neurotrophic factors, the cells were washed once with culture medium and left for 24 h in the incubator to produce luciferase, followed by the addition of the cell lysis reagent (Promega) (20 μl/well). Cells were incubated on a rotary shaker for 15 min and then subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle to ensure complete lysis. To measure luciferase activity, 5 μl of lysate was added to 20 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and counted on a MicroBeta luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Heparin Affinity Chromatography—The baculovirus expression system was used to produce full-length GFRα1 as well as GFRα1 D23C (14.Leppänen V.-M. Bespalov M.M. Runeberg-Roos P. Puurand ü. Merits A. Saarma M. Goldman A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The recombinant GFRαs had N-terminal FLAG-His6 tags. Conditioned Sf9 culture supernatants (10 ml) were mixed with an equal volume of 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and then applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Heparin column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After a 10-ml wash step with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl), we applied a linear gradient of NaCl in the same buffer up to a final concentration of 2.0 m. One-milliliter fractions were collected and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG (M1; Sigma) antibodies as well as assayed for GDNF binding activity by a scintillation proximity assay. Scintillation proximity assay polyvinyltoluene beads precoated with anti-mouse antibodies (GE Healthcare) were used together with anti-FLAG antibodies and 125I-labeled GDNF, as described (14.Leppänen V.-M. Bespalov M.M. Runeberg-Roos P. Puurand ü. Merits A. Saarma M. Goldman A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Crystallography—Protein complex that had been purified by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1A) was deglycosylated with peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs). The buffer was then changed to 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) P8340 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 0.001% NaN3, and the complex was crystallized at +4 °C using the Helsinki robot crystallization facility. The reservoir solution was 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 8% ethylene glycol, and the 200-nl drops were prepared by mixing 100 nl of the reservoir solution with 100 nl of the protein solution at 3 mg/ml. For data collection at -80 °C, the crystal was frozen in liquid nitrogen with the well solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. A full data set to 2.35 Å resolution was collected using the ID14-EH2 beamline at ESRF (Grenoble, France) (Table 1). Diffraction data were processed using XDS (24.Kabsch W. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab A single GFRα1 co-receptor and one GDNF monomer together gave a Matthews coefficient (VM) of 2.35 Å2/Da with 48% solvent content, suggesting that there was only a half of the quaternary complex per asymmetric unit. The other half of the complex is formed by the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry about the unique axis. We solved the structure by molecular replacement using the human GFRα3 domains 2 and 3 from the ARTN2·GFRα32 complex structure (Protein Data Bank code 2GH0 (13.Wang X. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Garcia K.C. Structure. 2006; 14: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)) and rat GDNF (Protein Data Bank code 1AGQ (25.Eigenbrot C. Gerber N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)) as search models with Phaser (26.Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). The initial R-factor after molecular replacement and one round of rigid body refinement was 48.5 (Rfree 47%). After 10 cycles of automated model building using ArpWarp (27.Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), 69% of the residues had been built, and Refmac5 (28.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar) refinement resulted in an initial Rwork of 20% (Rfree = 31%). Iterative model building and refinement using Coot (29.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and Refmac5 gave a final model with Rwork 18.4% (Rfree = 23.7%). Individual isotropic B factors were refined using restrained refinement. Water molecules were added with Coot (29.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) to peaks above 3.5σ in the Fo - Fc difference electron density map if they had suitable hydrogen bonding geometry and eliminated if they refined to a B-factor of greater than 70. The electron density quality was good throughout both the GDNF and GFRα1 structures (supplemental Fig. 1A) and more than 90% of residues were in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot (30.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) (Table 1). The first five residues of GFRα1 were disordered. The flexible N-terminal region of GDNF and the GFRα1 C-terminal extension (76 residues) were not visible due to proteolytic cleavage, as shown by SDS-PAGE of the crystals (data not shown). The ligand library for SOS and N-acetylglucosamine was generated with PRODRG (31.Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar). We validated the model using tools in Coot (29.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK (30.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Structural alignments were done using Coot (29.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and PyMol (32.DeLano W.L. PyMol. DeLano Scientific LLC, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar), and sequence alignments were done using ClustalW (33.Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4081) Google Scholar). Biochemical and Structural Characterization of GDNF2·GFRα12 Complex—We co-expressed GFRα1 domain 2-3-C (GFRα1 D23C) with GDNF in Tn5 insect cells and purified the GDNF2·GFRα12 complex in two steps: Ni2+ -Sepharose affinity purification in batch followed by size exclusion chromatography. SDS-PAGE showed that fraction 6 from the gel filtration column, which ran at about 100 kDa, contained two proteins, one of molecular mass 38 kDa (GFRα1 D23C) and the other of molecular mass 22 kDa (GDNF) (Fig. 1A). The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined using standard techniques (see “Materials and Methods”) to Rwork 18.4% (Rfree 23.7%), and the final model contained residues 150-349 of GFRα1 and residues 34-134 of GDNF (Table 1). Overview of the GDNF2·GFRα12 Complex and the Ligand Co-receptor Interface—In the GDNF2·GFRα12 complex, each GDNF monomer of the cysteine-linked homodimer, with two β-stranded finger loops and a helical heel (supplemental Fig. 1B), binds GFRα1 on its finger domain (Fig. 2A). As expected from sequence analysis and the ARTN2·GFRα32 structure (13.Wang X. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Garcia K.C. Structure. 2006; 14: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B), GFRα1 D2 and D3 are both “triangular helix spiral” domains (14.Leppänen V.-M. Bespalov M.M. Runeberg-Roos P. Puurand ü. Merits A. Saarma M. Goldman A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The two domains of GFRα1 pack so that D3 stabilizes D2, which in turn binds GDNF (Fig. 2A). One N-acetylglucosamine molecule is covalently linked to GDNF N49, and an SOS molecule binds to domain 2 in GFRα1 (Fig. 2A). Through a crystal contact, SOS also binds to the N terminus of a symmetry-related GDNF. At the GDNF·GFRα1 interface, the GDNF fingertips interact with the GFRα1 D2 through the center of the triangular helix spiral formed by α-helices α1, α2, and α5 (supplemental Fig. 1B). The GDNF·GFRα1 interface is composed of 14 contact residues from GDNF and 18 from GFRα1 D2 (Table 2), burying ∼950 Å2 as calculated with POPScomp (34.Fraternali F. Cavallo L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2950-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As in the ARTN·GFRα3 complex (13.Wang X. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Garcia K.C. Structure. 2006; 14: 1083-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the center of the interface is the Arg-171GFRα1-Glu-61GDNF-Arg-224GFRα1 ion triple (Fig. 2C). Asn-162GFRα1 is very important (see below) in stabilizing the ion triple. The amide C=O positions the Arg-171GFRα1 guanidine group, whereas the amide -NH2 positions Glu-61GDNF by forming three hydrogen bonds, to the Glu-62GDNF and Ser-112GDNF backbone carbonyls and to the carboxylate side chain of Glu-61GDNF (Fig. 2C). The key hydrophobic interactions are on the other side of Arg-171GFRα1 from Asn-162GFRα1; Tyr-120GDNF packs between Ile-175GFRα1 and Leu-114GDNF, and Ile-122GDNF packs between Ile-175GFRα1 and Thr-176GFRα1 (Table 2 and Fig. 2C).TABLE 2Interface contact residues within 4 ÅGDNFGFRα1Lys-60Lys-155Glu-61Ala-158, Asn-162, Arg-171, Arg-224Glu-62Lys-159, Asn-162 (Glu-62aThrough backbone.)Ile-64Leu-163Asp-108Lys-168bThrough water.Asp-109Lys-168bThrough water., Lys-169Asp-110Ser-172 (Asp-110aThrough backbone.)Leu-111Asn-162, Lys-168Ser-112Asn-162 (Ser-112aThrough backbone.), Arg-171, Ser-172, Ile-175Leu-114Arg-224Leu-118Glu-223Tyr-120Ile-175, Gln-227,aThrough backbone.

Heparin Binding Studies—The heparin mimic sucrose octasulfate (SOS) binds to and co-purifies with the GDNF2·GFRα12 complex over the gel filtration column. The negatively charged sulfate groups bind to Arg-190, Lys-194, Arg-197, Gln-198, and Lys-202 on GFRα1 D2 and to Asn-253, Tyr-254, and Arg-259 in the α6-α7 turn of GFRα1 D3 (Fig. 3A). SOS also mediates a crystal contact with GDNF in the neighboring complex. It binds Arg-35, Lys-37, and Arg-39 in the GDNF heel region (Fig. 3B), consistent with recent biochemical studies (21.Alfano I. Vora P. Mummery R.S. Mulloy B. Rider C.C. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The heparin-binding properties of the full-length GFRα1 and GFRα1 D23C were also tested with a heparin column (Fig. 3C). The full-length GFRα1 eluted only at very high (>1 m) NaCl concentration, indicating strong binding. GFRα1 D23C eluted at about half of the concentration, suggesting reduced but still specific binding. These results and the presence of SOS in the crystal structure are consistent with earlier suggestions that the Arg-190 to Lys-202-positive patch in GFRα1 D2 might bind heparan sulfate (14.Leppänen V.-M.

The malaria parasite is unable to salvage pyrimidines and relies on de novo biosynthesis for survival. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD), a mitochondrially localized flavoenzyme, catalyzes the rate-limiting step of this pathway and is therefore an attractive antimalarial chemotherapeutic target. Using a target-based high throughput screen, we have identified a series of potent, species-specific inhibitors of P. falciparum DHOD (pfDHOD) that are also efficacious against three cultured strains (3D7, HB3, and Dd2) of P. falciparum. The primary antimalarial mechanism of action of these compounds was confirmed to be inhibition of pfDHOD through a secondary assay with transgenic malaria parasites, and the structural basis for enzyme inhibition was explored through in silico structure-based docking and site-directed mutagenesis. Compound-mediated cytotoxicity was not observed with human dermal fibroblasts or renal epithelial cells. These data validate pfDHOD as an antimalarial drug target and provide chemical scaffolds with which to begin medicinal chemistry efforts.

Here we address this issue through the identification and characterization of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD) inhibitors with high specificity for the Plasmodium enzyme, submicromolar efficacy against cultured parasite strains, and no detectable cytotoxicity to human cells.DHOD is a flavoenzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of l-dihydroorotate (l-DHO) to orotate as part of the fourth and rate-limiting step of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway (Scheme 1) (12.Caroline D.F.

The DHOD enzyme family can be separated by sequence homology into two broad classes that correlate with cellular localization and preference for electron acceptors (16.Nagy M. Lacroute F. Thomas D.

Both classes of enzyme perform a two-step reaction that most likely proceeds through a ping-pong mechanism (19.Bjornberg O. Jordan D.B. Palfey B.A. Jensen K.F. Arch. Biochem.

Gram-positive bacteria and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae use a type 1 DHOD that is located in the cytosol and utilizes fumarate or NAD+ as an electron acceptor to reoxidize the flavin (FMN) prosthetic group in the second half-reaction of the redox process (13.Taylor M.L.

Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 176: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28.Gero A.M. O'Sullivan W.J. Biochem. Med. 1985; 34: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 29.Knecht W.

Bacteriol. 1964; 88: 105-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This class of enzyme uses quinones located in biological membranes as an electron acceptor (31.Loffler M. Jockel J. Schuster G. Becker C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Specifically, eukaryotic type 2 DHODs are localized to the inner mitochondrial space and utilize the respiratory chain quinone coenzyme Qn (CoQn), where the number of isoprenoid units (n) is variable, as a final electron acceptor (32.Eakin R.T. Mitchell H.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 134: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 33.Kennedy J. Arch. Biochem.

Humans and all characterized members of the genus Plasmodium utilize a type 2 DHOD for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis (34.Miller R.W. Curry J.R. Can. J.

Biochem. 1981; 13: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Pyrimidines are required for the biosynthesis of DNA, RNA, glycoproteins, and phospholipids. Most organisms possess both a salvage and de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway; however, the P. falciparum genome lacks necessary components in the pyrimidine salvage pathway rendering the parasite entirely dependent on de novo biosynthesis (39.Subbayya I.N. Ray S.S. Balaram P. Balaram H. Indian J. Med. Res. 1997; 106: 79-94PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Reyes P. Rathod P.K. Sanchez D.J. Mrema J.E. Rieckmann K.H. Heidrich H.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1982; 5: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that during the erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum development, the mitochondrial electron transport chain exists solely to regenerate CoQn to serve as an electron acceptor for DHOD (41.Painter H.J. Morrisey J.M. Mather M.W. Vaidya A.B. Nature. 2007; 446: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Although the salvage pathway for pyrimidines is generally able to fulfill the majority of metabolic needs in human cells, rapidly dividing cells such as activated T- and B-lymphocytes require de novo biosynthesis for sustained growth. The active metabolite of the Food and Drug Administration-approved immunomodulatory drug leflunomide, A77 1726, is an inhibitor of human DHOD (hsDHOD) that exploits this specific vulnerability for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (42.Goldenberg M.M. Clin. Ther. 1999; 21 (1837-1852): 1821Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 43.Herrmann M.L. Schleyerbach R. Kirschbaum B.J.

Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A number of other DHOD inhibitors have been described for Helicobacter pylori and Escherichia coli that exhibit species selectivity with respect to the human enzyme (46.Copeland R.A. Marcinkeviciene J. Haque T.S. Kopcho L.M. Jiang W. Wang K. Ecret L.D. Sizemore C. Amsler K.A. Foster L. Tadesse S. Combs A.P. Stern A.M. Trainor G.L. Slee A. Rogers M.J. Hobbs F. J. Biol.

Hobbs F. Haque T. Trainor G.L. Slee A. Stern A.M. Copeland R.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, species selectivity in designing small molecule inhibitors of P. falciparum DHOD (pfDHOD) should be possible as x-ray crystal structures of hsDHOD and pfDHOD in complex with A77 1726 and orotate show variability in both sequence and alignment of residues near the inhibitor-binding site (48.Liu S. Neidhardt E.A. Grossman T.H. Ocain T. Clardy J. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 49.Hurt D.E. Sutton A.E. Clardy J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2006; 16: 1610-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this structural variability, A77 1726 is a potent inhibitor of the human enzyme but a very poor inhibitor of pfDHOD (50.Baldwin J. Farajallah A.M. Malmquist N.A. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41827-41834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Combined, these findings indicate that small molecule inhibitors of pfDHOD could be useful chemotherapeutic agents for malaria.Although our primary goal was to identity inhibitors of pfDHOD that possessed activity against P. falciparum, we also tested inhibitors for activity against DHOD from the benign human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax and the causative agent of rodent malaria, Plasmodium berghei. P. vivax malaria poses an enormous economic burden throughout many developing countries (51.Mendis K. Sina B.J. Marchesini P. Carter R. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 64: S97-S106Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), and it would be advantageous to develop a single drug with efficacy against both pfDHOD and P. vivax DHOD (pvDHOD). The rodent malaria enzyme was examined because the accepted drug development pathway for P. falciparum malaria uses a P. berghei mouse model. All three DHOD proteins share significant homology, and thus it was hypothesized that candidate pfDHOD inhibitors may be efficacious against DHOD enzymes from other Plasmodium spp.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDHOD Plasmid Construction—pfDHOD was subcloned into the pET101D vector (Invitrogen) from a previously described codon-optimized, synthetic gene encoding amino acids 159-565 (49.Hurt D.E. Sutton A.E. Clardy J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2006; 16: 1610-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutant pfDHOD-pET22b expression constructs (H185A, F188A, F227A, R265A, I272A, TYR-528A, and L531A) were kindly provided by M. Phillips from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (50.Baldwin J. Farajallah A.M. Malmquist N.A. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41827-41834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 52.Malmquist N.A. Gujjar R. Rathod P.K.

Chem. 2005; 280: 21847-21853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Both wild-type and mutant pfDHOD constructs were in-frame with a C-terminal His6 tag. Full-length, codon-optimized DNA encoding the pbDHOD and pvDHOD genes were donated by GlaxoSmithKline (Philadelphia) and subcloned into the pET101D expression vector in-frame with the C-terminal His6 tag. To improve solubility, the P. berghei and P. vivax DHOD genes were truncated to include amino acids 132-518 and 160-573, respectively, based upon sequence alignment with pfDHOD. hsDHOD was subcloned into the pET101D expression vector in an analogous manner to the Plasmodium DHOD orthologs from a previously described expression plasmid with the final construct encoding amino acids 30-396 (48.Liu S. Neidhardt E.A. Grossman T.H. Ocain T. Clardy J. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8: 25-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Full-length S. cerevisiae DHOD (scDHOD) was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned directly into the pET101D expression vector in-frame with the C-terminal His6 tag. The DHOD open reading frames of all orthologs were sequenced in their entirety.DHOD Expression and Purification—E. coli BL-21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) transformed with either the wild-type or mutant pfDHOD, pvDHOD, pbDHOD, hsDHOD, or scDHOD expression constructs were grown in Terrific Broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C. Protein expression was induced at A600 ∼0.8 with the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 200 μm. The cultures were grown overnight at 22 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 7,000 × g at 4 °C and frozen at -20 °C for later use. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Bacterial pellets were thawed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100) supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). The cells were lysed by sonication and clarified by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was applied to a low pressure column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated in Buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The column was washed with Buffer A until the A280 reached a stable base line; bound DHOD was eluted with Buffer B (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 400 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm 2-mer-captaethanol). The eluted protein was serially dialyzed against Buffer C (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and found to be greater than 85% for all DHOD enzymes. Total protein concentration was determined by Bradford analysis. DHOD requires a bound FMN cofactor for catalysis, and thus the concentration of FMN should equal the concentration of active protein (36.Aleman V. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4087-4096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54.Powell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4793-4797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FMN concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at 445 nm (ϵ445 = 12.5 mm-1 cm-1) by heat-denaturing the protein to release bound cofactor. Purified DHOD was aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C for later use.High Throughput Screen to Identify pfDHOD Inhibitors—The chromogen reduction assay was adapted for a high throughput screen (HTS) for inhibitors of pfDHOD activity in 384-well plates based upon previous studies (53.Baldwin J. Michnoff C.H. Malmquist N.A. White J. Roth M.G. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21847-21853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The assay was performed in a final volume of 50 μl of 100 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 175 μm l-DHO, 11 μm decylubiquinone (CoQD), 95 μm 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCIP), and 10 nm pfDHOD. Compounds from the Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA) Small Molecule Library, comprised of 208,000 diverse, largely commercially available molecules, were pin-transferred into the 384-well assay plates to a final drug concentration of 10 μm for the initial screen. The reaction proceeded at room temperature for 20 min after which A600 was measured using an automated microplate reader. The quality of data from the final assay was assessed using a statistical measure described by Zhang et al. (55.Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5235) Google Scholar) where the Z-factor ≈0.6; a Z-factor between 0.5 and 1 is generally favorable for an HTS. Primary hits were defined as compounds that inhibited ≥70% of pfDHOD activity at the initial screening concentration of 10 μm. These compounds were re-tested at a concentration of 1 μm, and those that inhibited ≥50% of enzymatic activity were selected for half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) determination.Re-screening of Primary Hits from pfDHOD Screen and Chemical Analogs—Analogs of primary hits were purchased, as available, from ChemDiv (San Diego) and Maybridge (Corn-wall, UK). The purity of these compounds was greater than 90%. The active metabolite of leflunomide, A77 1726, was purchased from Axxora Life Sciences (San Diego). IC50 values, with respect to pfDHOD activity for candidate compounds, were calculated using the aforementioned 384-well based chromogen reduction assay with 16-24 different drug concentrations and reagent concentrations of 200 μm l-DHO, 18 μm CoQD, 100 μm DCIP, and 10 nm pfDHOD. The concentration of CoQD is approximately equivalent to the reported Km value, and the concentration of l-DHO is in excess (49.Hurt D.E. Sutton A.E. Clardy J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2006; 16: 1610-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 50.Baldwin J. Farajallah A.M. Malmquist N.A. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41827-41834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Select compounds were assayed in an analogous manner for the inhibition of site-directed pfDHOD mutants, pvDHOD, pbDHOD, or hsDHOD. The reported Km value of CoQD for pbDHOD, pvDHOD, hsDHOD, and pfDHOD variants with point mutations at H185A, F188A, F227A, R265A, I272A, or Y528A, L531A was approximately equivalent to that of wild-type pfDHOD, and thus, the substrate concentrations used to assay enzyme activity and calculate IC50 values were kept constant between the various proteins that were examined (37.Gutteridge W.E.

Sci. 1981; 59: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Inhibition of scDHOD, a type 1 DHOD, was evaluated using the DCIP assay described above for type 2 DHOD enzymes except that 115 μm fumarate was used in lieu of CoQD. The concentration of fumarate corresponds with the reported substrate Km value, whereas the concentration of l-DHO is in excess (58.Zameitat E. Knecht W. Piskur J. Loffler M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).DHOD activity using FeCy as an electron acceptor was measured continuously in a UV-transparent cuvette. The assay was performed in a final volume of 100 μl of 100 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 200 μm l-DHO, 100 μm ferricyanide (FeCy). Both the reduction of FeCy and the formation of orotate were monitored at 420 nm (ϵ420 = 1 mm-1 cm-1) and 290 nm (ϵ280 = 2 mm-1 cm-1), respectively, noting that two molecules of FeCy are reduced for one molecule of l-DHO. As with the previous assay, the reaction was performed at 25 °C and initiated with the addition of 5-10 nm of enzyme.Inhibition of in Vitro Cultured P. falciparum Parasites—P. falciparum strains D10, 3D7, HB3, and Dd2 were obtained from the Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Center (Manassas, VA). The parasite strains were maintained in vitro by the method of Trager and Jensen (59.Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6077) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained in fresh O-positive human erythrocytes (Interstate Blood Bank, Memphis, TN) in complete medium containing 50 ml of human O-positive serum (Interstate Blood Bank), 2.5 g of AlbuMAX® II (Invitrogen), 0.5 ml of gentamicin (Sigma), 5.94 g of HEPES (Sigma), 2.01 g of sodium bicarbonate (Sigma), 0.050 g of hypoxanthine (Sigma), and 10.44 g of RPMI 1640 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) per liter at pH 6.75. The parasite-infected erythrocytes were incubated at 37 °C in a gas environment of 5% CO2, 1% O2, and 94% N2.A transgenic P. falciparum stain expressing yeast DHOD was generated by amplification of full-length scDHOD from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and subsequent cloning into an episomal expression vector derived from the pHHM plasmid (60.Duraisingh M.T. Voss T.S. Marty A.J. Duffy M.F. Good R.T. Thompson J.K. Freitas-Junior L.H. Scherf A. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Cell. 2005; 121: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid was transfected into the D10 strain of P. falciparum by standard methods and grown under selection with WR99210 (Jacobus Pharmaceutical Co., Princeton, NJ).Inhibition of P. falciparum growth in the presence of drug was assessed by the relative reduction of [3H]hypoxanthine uptake (61.Chulay J.D. Haynes J.D. Diggs C.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1983; 55: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 62.Geary T.G. Divo A.A. Jensen J.B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, synchronized ring stage parasites at 1% parasitemia and 2% hematocrit were dispensed into 96-well plates containing dilutions of the candidate compounds. After 24 h, 0.4 μCi of [3H]hypoxanthine was added to each well, and the parasites were incubated for another 48 h at 37 °C. P. falciparum parasites were harvested onto glass fiber filters, and the amount of [3H]hypoxanthine uptake was assessed by scintillation counting.Structure-based Docking—All programs were from Suite 2008 from Schrödinger LLC (New York). A crystal structure of A77 1726 bound to pfDHOD (Protein Data Bank code 1TV5) was optimized for docking studies with Protein Preparation Wizard. Three-dimensional ligand structures were generated via LigPrep. Ligands were fit to the crystal structure with Glide version 50111 in extra precision (XP) mode. Images were obtained through the Maestro interface.Cytotoxicity of Candidate Compounds—Human dermal fibroblasts were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium (Cambrex Inc., East Rutherford, NJ) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2× Complete Amino Acids (Sigma), 2× MEM vitamins (Sigma), and penicillin-streptomycin/l-glutamine (Cambrex). Cells were grown to 70-80% confluency, diluted to 0.25-0.3 × 105 cells/ml in fresh medium, and 200 μl aliquoted into 96-well flat bottom tissue culture treated plates. Candidate compounds were added after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell viability was assessed after 96 h by staining with Alamar Blue (BIOSOURCE). Cytotoxicity to renal proximal tubule epithelial cells was evaluated using the same method as described above except that the renal epithelial growth medium bullet kit (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) was used in lieu of Earle's minimal essential medium and the renal epithelial cells were diluted to 1.5×104 cells/ml prior to aliquoting into 96-well plates.RESULTSHigh Throughput Screen to Identify Inhibitors of pfDHOD—DHOD catalyzes the oxidation of l-DHO to orotate via a ping-pong mechanism using a FMN cofactor that is reoxidized by the second substrate, CoQn (Scheme 1). Enzymatic activity of DHOD can be assessed in the presence of l-DHO and CoQn by directly measuring the formation of orotate or coupling the assay to the chromogen DCIP. The latter colorimetric assay was adapted for an HTS of recombinant pfDHOD in 384-well plates in a manner similar to that described by Baldwin et al. (53.Baldwin J. Michnoff C.H. Malmquist N.A. White J. Roth M.G. Rathod P.K. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21847-21853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). CoQD was chosen as the second substrate as it is significantly more soluble than ubiquinone (CoQ10) and has been previously described to be efficiently utilized by pfDHOD (50.Baldwin J.

The concentration CoQD used in the HTS was approximately equivalent to the reported Km value for both hsDHOD and pfDHOD, and the concentration of l-DHO was in slight excess (49.Hurt D.E. Sutton A.E.

The optimized screening assay afforded a Z-factor ≈0.6, and a value between 0.5 and 1 is generally considered favorable for an HTS (55.Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5235) Google Scholar).The Genzyme Corp. chemical library of 208,000 compounds was screened for inhibitors of pfDHOD at an initial drug concentration of 10 μm; 689 (0.3%) compounds were found to inhibit ≥70% of pfDHOD activity when compared with control reactions containing no drug. These compounds were cherry-picked and re-tested at a concentration of 1 μm yielding 55 compounds that inhibited ≥50% of pfDHOD activity. Dose-effect curves identified 38 (0.02%) compounds with submicromolar IC50 values with respect to pfDHOD activity. The long, hydrophobic quinone binding tunnel of pfDHOD likely accommodates a variety of ligands, which is consistent with the core structural diversity of compounds identified that inhibit the enzyme (49.Hurt D.E.

In contrast to other systems, where heparin acts as a protein scaffold, we found that heparin functions catalytically to modulate VEGF binding site availability on fibronectin. By measuring the binding of VEGF and heparin to surface-immobilized fibronectin, we show that substoichiometric amounts of heparin exposed cryptic VEGF binding sites within fibronectin that remain available after heparin removal. Measurement of association and dissociation kinetics for heparin binding to fibronectin indicated that the interaction is rapid and transient. We localized the heparin-responsive element to the C-terminal 40-kDa Hep2 domain of fibronectin. A mathematical model of this catalytic process was constructed that supports a mechanism whereby the heparin-induced conformational change in fibronectin is accompanied by release of heparin. Experiments with endothelial extracellular matrix suggest that this process may also occur within biological matrices. These results indicate a novel mechanism whereby heparin catalyzes the conversion of fibronectin to an open conformation by transiently interacting with fibronectin and progressively hopping from molecule to molecule. Catalytic activation of the extracellular matrix might be an important mechanism for heparin to regulate function during normal and disease states.

Heparin and heparan sulfate are linear polysaccharides composed of repeating glucosamine-hexuronic acid disaccharide units (1.Sasisekharan R. Venkataraman G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate chains are found attached to core proteins in proteoglycans on cell surfaces and within the extracellular matrix of nearly all mammalian cells and tissues (2.Stringer S.E. Gallagher J.T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In contrast, heparin is stored exclusively in the granules of certain subsets of mast cells (3.Metcalfe D.D. Baram D. Mekori Y.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1033-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). The physiological role of heparin has not been fully explored. It is known that heparin is important for the storage of the numerous proteases in the mast cell granules (4.Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M.

Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1645-1646PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested a correlation between stimulated, degranulating mast cells and growth and metastasis of several types of tumors (7.Ch'ng S. Wallis R.A. Yuan L. Davis P.F. Tan S.T. Mod. Pathol. 2006; 19: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 8.della Rovere F. Granata A. Familiari D. D'Arrigo G. Mondello B. Basile G. Anticancer Res. 2007; 27: 2465-2471PubMed Google Scholar). Mast cells contain numerous mediators that are likely to affect several pathways of tumor progression, including immunosuppression, enhancement of angiogenesis, degradation of the extracellular matrix, and stimulation of tumor cell mitosis (7.Ch'ng S. Wallis R.A. Yuan L. Davis P.F. Tan S.T. Mod. Pathol. 2006; 19: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9.Nienartowicz A. Sobaniec-Lotowska M.E. Jarocka-Cyrta E. Lemancewicz D. Med. Sci. Monit. 2006; 12: RA53-RA56PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role that heparin release upon mast cell degranulation plays in these pathways is unclear. Some studies suggest that mast cell heparin promotes mitosis and migration of endothelial cells (10.Azizkhan R.G. Azizkhan J.C. Zetter B.R. Folkman J. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Moreover, the anticoagulant properties of heparin prevent the formation of thrombi in the newly formed vessels (11.Nader H.B. Lopes C.C. Rocha H.A. Santos E.A. Dietrich C.P. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 951-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Other studies show that heparin has the ability to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis (12.Borsig L. Pathophysiol. Haemost Thromb. 2003; 33: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 13.Zacharski L.R. Cancer Lett. 2002; 186: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14.Zacharski L.R. Ornstein D.L.

Rev. 2001; 53: 93-105PubMed Google Scholar), and there is some evidence that it may do so through an indirect mechanism, by interfering with the interaction between fibroblasts and the adjacent tumor cells (16.Samoszuk M. Kanakubo E. Chan J.K. BMC Cancer. 2005; 5: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although heparin and heparan sulfate share similar chemical backbones, heparin exhibits a higher degree of sulfation and a more uniform distribution of sulfate groups along the chain, and it contains almost exclusively the iduronic epimer of the hexuronic acid residue (17.Raman R. Raguram S. Venkataraman G. Paulson J.C. Sasisekharan R. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These properties are likely to determine the specificity of interactions between heparin and heparan sulfate with proteins (18.Powell A.K. Yates E.A. Fernig D.G. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 17R-30RCrossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Fibronectin, a major component of extracellular matrices, is a glycoprotein consisting of several individually folded domains connected with flexible linker regions (19.Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Interdomain interactions are important determinants of the overall tertiary structure of the protein (20.Williams E.C.

Fibronectin is able to interact with heparin and heparan sulfate, and there is evidence that this interaction affects the structure of the protein (23.Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Atha D.H. Biochem.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that heparin mediates a conformational change in fibronectin from a compact to a more extended conformation, potentially by interfering with interdomain interactions (29.Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E. Nugent M.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10319-10328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One consequence of the conformational change is the exposure of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 2The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ECM, extracellular matrix. binding sites on the surface of fibronectin, leading to increased VEGF binding.

In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which heparin alters fibronectin conformation, leading to increased VEGF binding. We found that substoichiometric amounts of heparin are able to mediate the conformational change, as monitored by the increased capacity of fibronectin to bind VEGF, without the formation of a stable complex between fibronectin, heparin, and VEGF. We propose that this mechanism reflects a new catalytic biological function of heparin, whereby the structure of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is modulated in sites where heparin is released in order to coordinate growth factor binding and activity. Materials—Human recombinant VEGF165 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and from the NCI Bulk Cytokine and Monoclonal Antibody Preclinical Repository (Frederick, MD). 125I-VEGF165 was prepared using a modified Bolton-Hunter procedure, as previously described (40.Goerges A.L. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19518-19525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Heparin, desulfated heparin derivatives, heparin fragments, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate were from Neoparin (San Leonardo, CA), and dermatan sulfate was from Seikagaku (Japan). Heparinase I from Flavobacterium heparinum was from IBEX (Montreal, Canada). Plasso EpranEx™ heparin-binding plates were a gift from BMG Labtech (Sheffield, UK) and are now available from BD Biosciences. Human plasma fibronectin and α-chymotryptic fragments of human fibronectin (120 and 40 kDa) were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The tryptic fragment of the N-terminal domain of human fibronectin (70 kDa) was from Sigma. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and HEPES were purchased from Invitrogen. All other reagents used were purchased from Sigma. Radiolabeling of Heparin—125I-Heparin was produced using a modified Bolton-Hunter procedure. 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent, in anhydrous benzene (1 μCi), was dried with a gentle stream of N2. 100 μg of heparin was added in a final volume of 30 μl in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, and was allowed to react for 2.5 h on ice. The reaction was quenched with 200 μl of 0.2 m glycine for 45 min on ice. 125I-Heparin was isolated using a PD-10 Sephadex G-25 M column. The specific activity of the 125I-heparin preparation was 289 nCi/μg. 125I-heparin was as effective as unlabeled heparin at enhancing VEGF binding to fibronectin, and isotopic dilution analysis showed that labeled and unlabeled heparin bound to fibronectin identically (data not shown). Heparin Binding to Fibronectin and Fibronectin Fragments—Fibronectin or fibronectin fragments were adsorbed on 96-well hydrophobic polystyrene plates in PBS at 4 °C overnight (29.Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E. Nugent M.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10319-10328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Incubations with 125I-heparin were carried out in PBS at room temperature (50 μl/well). For association kinetics, incubation times were varied from 1 min to 1 h. For equilibrium binding studies, the incubation time was 2 h. Bound heparin was extracted with a 5 m NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, buffer, and radioactivity was measured using a Cobra Auto-Gamma 505 counter (Packard Instruments, Meridian, CT). The concentration of bound heparin was calculated based on a 50-μl reaction volume. For dissociation kinetics studies, 125I-heparin was incubated for 2 h at room temperature to allow for equilibrium binding, after which the 125I-heparin solution was replaced by PBS with and without 5 μg/ml (335 nm) unlabeled heparin (release buffer). The release buffer was collected after various incubation periods at room temperature. Bound 125I-heparin was extracted with 5 m NaCl at each time point, as described above. In competition experiments, 125I-heparin was mixed with 100 μg/ml unlabeled competitor: heparin, heparin fragments, chemically desulfated heparin derivatives, or other glycosaminoglycans (2-O-desulfated heparin, in which most of the O-sulfate groups on C-2 of uronic acid residues have been removed; 6-O-desulfated heparin, in which most of the O-sulfate groups on C-6 of glucosamine residues have been removed; O-desulfated heparin, in which all O-sulfate esters of heparin have been removed; N-desulfated heparin, in which N-sulfate groups of the N-sulfated glucosamine residues have been removed; heparan sulfate; N-sulfate-glucosamine-rich heparan sulfate; N-acetyl-glucosamine-rich heparan sulfate; chondroitin sulfate; and dermatan sulfate). Kinetic Analysis of the Heparin-catalyzed Conformational Change in Fibronectin—Fibronectin, adsorbed onto hydrophobic polystyrene 96-well plates, was treated with heparin in PBS (50 μl/well) for various periods of time (1 min to 2 h) at room temperature. Following the treatment, the heparin solution was aspirated, the wells were washed three times with PBS, and VEGF binding assays were conducted with 6 nm 125I-VEGF165 at pH 5.5, as previously described (29.Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E. Nugent M.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10319-10328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The measured concentration of bound VEGF (extracted with 5 m NaCl) and the equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd = 100 nm (29.Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E. Nugent M.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10319-10328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), were used to calculate the concentration of available VEGF binding sites on the fibronectin-coated surface, Fo, F0=[VEGF]b(Kd+[VEGF]f)[VEGF]f(Eq. 1) where [VEGF]b and [VEGF]f are the concentrations of bound and free VEGF, respectively. Binding of VEGF to Heparin—Heparin was adsorbed onto Plasso EpranEx™ 96-well plates. These plates have been modified by plasma polymerization to present an amine surface that can bind heparin in a noncovalent fashion (41.Mahoney D.J. Whittle J.D. Milner C.M. Clark S.J. Mulloy B. Buttle D.J. Jones G.C. Day A.J. Short R.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 330: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine the extent of heparin adsorption, 125I-heparin (0.5–100 ng) was added (200 μl/well in PBS), and the amount bound was determined by extraction with a 5 m NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, buffer. For the heparin concentrations tested, ∼30% was adsorbed onto the plate. To determine the extent of VEGF binding to heparin, unlabeled heparin was adsorbed onto the plate, and VEGF binding assays were conducted using 6 nm 125I-VEGF165, as previously described (29.Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E. Nugent M.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10319-10328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Isolation and Treatment of Extracellular Matrices—ECM derived from bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures were isolated as previously described (29.Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E. Nugent M.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10319-10328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in 24-well plates for 3 days postconfluence and then lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm NH4OH in PBS to expose the ECM surface. ECM preparations were treated with PBS (500 μl/well) with or without trypsin (0.1 μg/ml; 0.6 units/well) for 30 min at 37 °C. Following the incubation, the trypsin solution was removed, and the ECM coated wells were incubated for 10 min with a solution of soybean trypsin inhibitor in PBS (500 μl/well; 100 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with PBS (500 μl/well) prior to any further treatment (fibronectin adsorption, heparin treatment, VEGF binding, or extraction for Western blotting). The matrix preparations were visualized with Coomassie Blue after staining for 48 h at room temperature to ensure that the mild trypsinization did not completely degrade the matrix (data not shown). Exogenous fibronectin was deposited onto the isolated matrices (40 nm in PBS; 500 μl/well) overnight at 4 °C. Heparin treatments were conducted with 67 nm heparin (500 μl/well) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. To visualize fibronectin content within the ECM, the matrices were extracted by scraping in 100 μl/well of boiling sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 14.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using an anti-fibronectin antibody (catalog number 610077; BD Biosciences). Kinetic Model—For the determination of the kinetic constants describing heparin binding to fibronectin, we considered the following single-site model, F+Hkf⇄krC where F denotes fibronectin, H is 125I-heparin, C is the complex between fibronectin and 125I-heparin (bound heparin), kf is the association kinetic constant, and kr is the dissociation kinetic constant. Dissociation of 125I-heparin from fibronectin in the presence or absence of unlabeled heparin in solution resulted in significantly different kinetics of release (see “Results”), suggesting that rebinding events are critical for heparin-fibronectin interactions. When rebinding is included the resulting equation is as follows, dpdt=-krp+kfH(1-p-h)(Eq. 2) where p(t) represents the fraction of fibronectin bound to 125I-heparin at time t, and h(t) is the fraction of fibronectin bound to unlabeled heparin (when present). Assuming that unlabeled heparin equilibrates quickly, we replace h with h*, its equilibrium value. If p(0) << 1, the resulting differential equation can be solved (42.Gopalakrishnan M. Forsten-Williams K. Cassino T.R. Padro L. Ryan T.E. Tauber U.C. Eur. Biophys. J. 2005; 34: 943-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to yield the following, p(t)=p(0)ecterfc(ct)(Eq. 3) where c represents a parameter describing the heparin-fibronectin interaction, which includes the diffusion coefficient, the dissociation equilibrium constant, and the surface coverage with fibronectin. Data fitting was performed using Matlab R2006b (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA). Mathematical Model Development—Our model was based on mass action kinetics and a 1:1 stoichiometry of heparin to fibronectin binding site, assuming a constant total number of binding sites. Direct independent irreversible conversion of “closed” to “open” sites was assumed. The set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations were solved using the stiff ordinary differential equation solver ode15s in Matlab R2007b with the backwards differentiation formulas option and an absolute tolerance criterion of 1 × 10-10. The dimensionless equations describing the binding interaction are as follows, dCdτ=-p1CH+p2C∗(Eq. 4) dC∗dτ=p1CH-p2C∗-p2p3C∗(Eq. 5) dO∗dτ=p2p3C∗-O∗+OH(Eq. 6) dOdτ=O∗-OH(Eq. 7) dHdτ=(-p1CH+p2C∗+O∗-OH)p4(Eq. 8) where C + C* + O + O* = 1. C and C* are the closed binding sites, without (C) and with (C*) heparin bound, scaled by T, the total number of binding sites, and O and O* are similarly scaled open binding sites. H is the heparin concentration scaled by the association constant for the open sites (KAO), and τ is the time scaled by the dissociation rate constant for the open sites (KdO). Four dimensionless parameters describe the process (p1=KaC/kaO,p2=kdC/kdO,p3=kdC/kc,andp4=TKAO/navV), where KaC and KaC are the association rate constants for the closed and open sites, KdC is the dissociation rate constant for the closed sites, kc is the conversion first order rate constant for closed to open sites, and navV is a scaling value to convert concentration to binding sites based on volume. Simulations were run using p2 = 1, p3 = 0.1, and p4 = 100 with p1 varied to allow comparison of affinity effects. All sites were initially assumed to be in the closed conformation. The heparin concentration was varied for simulations with values shown in the figure legend. Nonstoichiometric Increase in VEGF Binding to Fibronectin by Heparin—Previously (29.Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E. Nugent M.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10319-10328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we showed that treatment of surface-adsorbed fibronectin with heparin leads to an increase in the number of VEGF binding sites within the fibronectin matrix, accompanied by a conformational change in fibronectin from a compact (closed) to a more extended (open) conformation (Fo). The effect of heparin was observed with fibronectin adsorbed to hydrophobic polystyrene or mica and was not dependent on whether the fibronectin was treated with heparin while being adsorbed or after surface adsorption (29.Mitsi M. Hong Z. Costello C.E. Nugent M.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10319-10328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 3M. Mitsi, K. Forsten-Williams, M. Gopalakrishnan, and M. A. Nugent, unpublished data. It is possible that heparin acts to facilitate VEGF binding either by binding to both fibronectin and VEGF to create a molecular bridge or by forming a ternary complex similar to what is observed with growth factors, such as FGF-2 and its receptors (43.Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar, 44.Nugent M.A. Iozzo R.V. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). If so, the maximum amount of VEGF bound to fibronectin, which is equivalent to the concentration of open fibronectin binding sites (Fo) as described under “Experimental Procedures,” would be expected to be similar to the amount of heparin bound to the fibronectin matrix following the treatment period. To test these possibilities, we measured how much heparin was retained on the fibronectin matrix after the treatment and compared this level with the number of VEGF binding sites that are made available by the heparin treatment. Using 125I-heparin, we measured the amount of heparin retained within the fibronectin matrix at various times over a 2-h treatment period. Surprisingly, we found that only a small fraction (∼1%) of the heparin was retained on the fibronectin matrix after treatment, yet this amount of heparin resulted in a dramatic nonstoichiometric increase in the number of fibronectin molecules with open sites capable of binding VEGF (Fo) (Fig. 1A). For example, after 2 h of treatment with 67 nm heparin, only 0.62 nm remained associated with the fibronectin matrix, yet this treatment resulted in an increase in the capacity of the fibronectin to bind VEGF (Fo = 30 nm) such that nearly the entire population of fibronectin was available to bind VEGF. The ratio of bound heparin to the concentration of open binding sites on fibronectin was nearly 1:50, indicating that heparin is not acting as a molecular bridge to tether VEGF to fibronectin. Additional support for this hypothesis was provided by a direct measure of VEGF binding to heparin. This analysis revealed that the low levels of heparin that are retained on the fibronectin matrix would contribute minimally as direct binding sites for VEGF on heparin-treated fibronectin (Fig. 1B). Heparin was adsorbed onto Plasso EpranEx™ heparin-binding plates, and VEGF binding to the surface-associated heparin was measured. With concentrations of adsorbed heparin up to 3 nm (5 times higher than the amount bound to fibronectin in Fig. 1A), we observed no detectable VEGF binding. Only when relatively large amounts of heparin were adsorbed onto the surface of the plates (21 and 41 nm) was detectable binding of VEGF observed. Even under these conditions, the magnitude of VEGF bound to the heparin surfaces was much less than the levels of VEGF bound to heparin-treated fibronectin. Hence, it appears that the small fraction of heparin that remains bound to fibronectin after treatment is not directly involved in mediating VEGF binding to the matrix. Indeed, removal of heparin, by passive dissociation or by active degradation with heparinase I, did not result in a reduction in the VEGF binding capacity of the heparin-treated fibronectin matrix (Fig. 2). These data indicate that once the VEGF binding sites were made available in fibronectin by exposure to heparin, the presence of heparin was no longer required to sustain the effect and that this effect is irreversible under these experimental conditions. Heparin Binding to Fibronectin Is Rapid and Transient—The observation that heparin treatment of fibronectin can lead to an increase in VEGF binding that does not require the continued presence of heparin after the treatment period suggests that heparin catalyzes the conversion of fibronectin from a closed state to an open conformation through its ability to reversibly interact with the fibronectin matrix. The low retention of bound heparin supports a model where the interaction between heparin and fibronectin is transient. To quantify this, fibronectin was incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-heparin until equilibrium was reached, and the amount of bound heparin was measured (Fig. 3A). Determination of the number of binding sites using a single-site model showed that only a minor fraction of fibronectin was bound to heparin (∼1 heparin molecule/20 fibronectin molecules; dissociation constant (Kd) = 19 ± 4 nm). To further investigate the mechanism of heparin action, we performed association and dissociation kinetic analyses of heparin binding to fibronectin (Fig. 3, B and C). The association kinetics show that heparin binding approaches equilibrium by 2 h; thus, dissociation studies were conducted after allowing 125I-heparin to bind to fibronectin for 2 h. Bound 125I-heparin was allowed to release for various periods in buffer with and without unlabeled heparin (5 μg/ml; 335 nm). At each dissociation time point, the amount of 125I-heparin remaining bound was measured (Fig. 3C). The differences observed in the kinetics of dissociation in the presence and absence of unlabeled heparin indicate that there is significant rebinding of heparin to fibronectin during the dissociation period, a function not captured in the simple dissociation model. In the absence of unlabeled heparin, rebinding produced slow observed dissociation of heparin from fibronectin, and neither model (neither rebinding nor simple dissociation) fit the data. Fitting the dissociation data in the presence of unlabeled heparin to the rebinding model described under “Experimental Procedures” (Equation 3), however, was quite successful, with a single parameter fit of c = 0.12 ± 0.05 min-1. A simple exponential dissociation model, where rebinding of heparin to fibronectin is not included, failed to fit the data, despite the presence of high concentrations of unlabeled heparin. The rebinding model, which fits our transient data well, would predict that a molecule of heparin that dissociates from fibronectin will rebind to the fibronectin matrix many times prior to diffusing to the bulk solution (42.Gopalakrishnan M.

Here we show that PI3K regulates axon specification and elongation through the GTPase Rheb and its target mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Overexpression of Rheb induces the formation of multiple axons, whereas its suppression by RNA interference blocks axon specification. mTOR is a central regulator of translation that phosphorylates eIF4E-binding proteins like 4E-BP1. Axon formation was suppressed by inhibition of mTOR and expression of mTOR-insensitive 4E-BP1 mutants. Inhibition of PI3K or mTOR reduced the level of Rap1B, which acts downstream of Rheb and mTOR. The ubiquitin E3 ligase Smurf2 mediates the restriction of Rap1B by initiating its degradation. Suppression of Smruf2 by RNA interference is able to compensate the loss of Rheb.

Cell Culture, Pharmacological Treatment, and Transfection of Hippocampal Neurons—Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons from embryonic day 18 rat (Rattus norvegicus) embryos were prepared as described previously (70Schwamborn J.C. Li Y. Püschel A.W. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, dissected hippocampi were incubated with papain (Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C and dissociated by pipetting in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips coated with polyornithine (Sigma) and cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Neurons were plated at a higher density (30-50,000 cells per 14-mm coverslip) for transfection and lower density (10-20,000 cells per coverslip) for protein localization and treatment with rapamycin. After neurons attached to the substrate (around 3-5 h after plating) the medium was changed to Neurobasal medium with B27 supplement, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Rapamycin, LY294002, and insulin were added directly to neuronal cultures after the medium was changed to Neurobasal medium. Neurons were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation 6-8 h after plating or by electroporation using the Rat Neuron Nucleofector Kit (Amaxa). For electroporation, 2.5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofectamine solution, transfected according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and plated at 100,000 cells per coverslip. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 15% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min on ice. Immunofluorescence and Data Analysis—Neuronal morphology was analyzed using a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) equipped with a Plan-Apochromat ×63/1.4 NA oil objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) and a Universal Imaging SPOT CCD camera (SPOT Insight 4; Diagnostic Instruments) and the SPOT Advanced Imaging software 4.1 (Diagnostic Instruments), and Adobe Photoshop. The same settings (exposure time, gain, and binning) and the same post-processing operations were always used to analyze the distribution of a specific protein.

Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were embedded in Fluorescent Mounting Medium (DakoCytomation). Processes showing Tau-1 immunoreactivity in their distal segments were counted as axons, MAP2-positive neurites longer than one cell diameter as dendrites. Neurons, which did not extend any axon, were classified as unpolarized and those that extended a single axon as polarized. The length of neurites was determined using the SPOT Advanced Imaging software, fluorescence intensity with Imagetool. The Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance. Western Blot—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and neurons were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 2× SDS buffer. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Peroxidase activity was visualized by the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Detection system (Pierce).

Rheb, Tsc2, and p-Tsc2 were detectable in the cell body and all processes in stage 2 neurons (supplemental Fig. S1). At stage 3, Rheb and p-Tsc2 became enriched in the axon. To test if Rheb is required for the specification of axons, we suppressed endogenous Rheb by RNAi in cultures of hippocampal neurons from E18 rat embryos. The effectiveness of the shRNA vector pSb102 directed against Rheb was confirmed by Western blot after expression in human embryonic kidney 293T cells and immunofluorescence using primary neurons (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Suppression of Rheb by RNAi significantly reduced the number of polarized neurons. 42 ± 3% (mean ± S.E.) of the neurons did not extend an axon (control (pSuper): 9 ± 4%) and only 52 ± 2% formed a single axon compared with 82 ± 5% in controls (Fig. 1, B and C). The length of those axons that were formed was significantly reduced to 117 ± 13 μm compared with 186 ± 8 μm in controls (Fig. 1D). Suppression of Rheb had no effect on minor neurites (Fig. 1E). The loss of Rheb could be rescued by expression of mouse Rheb that is resistant to suppression by the RNAi vector pSb102 because of differences to the sequence of rat Rheb (supplemental Fig. S2, C-I). These results show that Rheb is required for the specification and elongation of axons. To investigate if Rheb acts through mTOR, we treated hippocampal neurons shortly after plating (0 days in vitro, d.i.v.) with rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR. Rapamycin blocked the establishment of neuronal polarity and inhibited the specification of axons in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, F and G). Only a minority of neurons extended an axon in the presence of rapamycin, possibly because it was already specified at the time when rapamycin was added to the culture. However, the length of these axons was significantly reduced compared with controls. In the continuous presence of rapamycin, axon formation was blocked even at 5 d.i.v. (supplemental Fig. S2J). The number and length of minor neurites were not changed significantly (data not shown). Treatment with rapamycin did not increase the number of neurons undergoing apoptosis (data not shown). These results show that mTOR activity is required for axon specification and elongation during the establishment of neuronal polarity. Rheb Acts Downstream of PI3K and Upstream of mTOR to Specify Axons—To test if activation of mTOR has an effect on axon formation, we transfected hippocampal neurons with an expression vector for Rheb. Overexpression of Rheb increased the number of neurons with multiple axons compared with controls (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, it also enhanced axon extension (Fig. 2C, EGFP, 194 ± 18 μm; Rheb, 344 ± 20 μm). Both the number and length of minor neurites were not changed, showing that the effects of Rheb overexpression are specific for axons and do not result a general stimulation of neurite growth (Fig. 2, D and E). PI3K activity is required for neuronal polarity and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocks axon formation (Fig. 3, A and B) (9Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 11Schwamborn J.C. Püschel A.W. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Rheb stimulates cell growth downstream of PI3K and upstream of mTOR (14Hay N. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar, 26Inoki K. Ouyang H. Li Y. Guan K.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 79-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the same pathway is active during neuronal polarization, we tested if expression of Rheb can rescue the loss of neuronal polarity observed after treatment with LY294002. In the presence of LY294002, 69 ± 2% of the neurons transfected with a vector for EGFP failed to form an axon (Fig. 3). Expression of Rheb rescued these polarity defects and induced the formation of a single axon in 70 ± 3% of the neurons in the presence of LY294002. The number and length of minor neurites was not affected (data not shown). Rheb induced multiple axons in only 16 ± 1% of the cells when PI3K was inhibited compared with 61 ± 3% in controls (Fig. 3). This effect is similar to that of Rap1BV12 expression in neurons treated with LY294002, which also induces primarily a single axon and requires PI3K to induce supernumerary axons (8Jiang H. Guo W. Liang X. Rao Y. Cell. 2005; 120: 123-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 11Schwamborn J.C. Püschel A.W. Nat.

Cell. 2005; 120: 137-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). To confirm that the effects of Rheb expression are mediated by mTOR, we tested whether they can be blocked by rapamycin. Rapamycin suppressed the induction of multiple axons and the increase in axon length by Rheb (Fig. 3). Although 61 ± 3% of the neurons formed multiple axons after expression of Rheb, only 1 ± 0.4% of the neurons had supernumerary axons when rapamycin was added. The number and length of minor neurites was not affected (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Rheb regulates axon specification and extension downstream of PI3K and upstream of mTOR. mTOR-insensitive 4E-BP1 Mutants Block Axon Formation and Suppress the Effects of Rheb—One of the targets of mTOR is 4E-BP1 that regulates translation through its interaction with eIF4E (17Ruggero D.

Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr37 and Thr46 by mTOR serves as a priming event for phosphorylation at other sites such as Ser65. 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation results in the stimulation of translation (29Gingras A.C.

At 24 h in culture (early stage 2), 4E-BP1 phosphorylated at Ser65 (p-4E-BP1) was present throughout the cell body and all neurites, but became enriched in the growth cone of a single neurite in the majority of neurons at 36 h (late stage 2) and to the axon tip at stage 3 (supplemental Fig. S3, B-H). The axonal enrichment of p-4E-BP1 in stage 3 neurons was not detectable after inhibition of PI3K or mTOR (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). An antibody to analyze the distribution of phosphorylated 4E-BP2 by immunofluorescence was not available. Consistent with the function of Rheb as an activator of mTOR, the supernumerary axons induced by Rheb were positive for p-4E-BP1 (data not shown). Thus, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation is stimulated through the PI3K/mTOR pathway during neuronal polarization. To examine the function of 4E-BP1, two mTOR-insensitive 4E-BP1 mutants were e"

GPIHBP1 is located within capillaries of muscle and adipose tissue, and expression of GPIHBP1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells confers upon those cells the ability to bind lipoprotein lipase (LPL). However, there has been absolutely no evidence that GPIHBP1 actually interacts with LPL in vivo. Heparin is known to release LPL from its in vivo binding sites, allowing it to enter the plasma. After an injection of heparin, we reasoned that LPL bound to GPIHBP1 in capillaries would be released very quickly, and we hypothesized that the kinetics of LPL entry into the plasma would differ in Gpihbp1–/– and control mice. Indeed, plasma LPL levels peaked very rapidly (within 1 min) after heparin in control mice. In contrast, plasma LPL levels in Gpihbp1–/– mice were much lower 1 min after heparin and increased slowly over 15 min. In keeping with that result, plasma triglycerides fell sharply within 10 min after heparin in wild-type mice, but were negligibly altered in the first 15 min after heparin in Gpihbp1–/– mice. Also, an injection of Intralipid released LPL into the plasma of wild-type mice but was ineffective in releasing LPL in Gpihbp1–/– mice. The observed differences in LPL release cannot be ascribed to different tissue stores of LPL, as LPL mass levels in tissues were similar in Gpihbp1–/– and control mice. The differences in LPL release after intravenous heparin and Intralipid strongly suggest that GPIHBP1 represents an important binding site for LPL in vivo.

Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins) undergo lipolysis along the surface of capillaries, mainly in heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue (1.Havel R.J.

This lipolytic processing is carried out by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) 4The abbreviations used are: LPL, lipoprotein lipase; GPIHBP1, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein 1; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan.

LPL is synthesized and secreted by parenchymal cells (e.g. myocytes, adipocytes) and then translocated into the lumen of capillaries, where it is widely assumed to bind to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (1.Havel R.J.

The binding of LPL is thought to involve electrostatic interactions between positively charged “heparin-binding domains” in LPL and negatively charged HSPGs. Multiple lines of evidence have supported this concept. Affinity chromatography of endothelial cell extracts on an LPL-Sepharose column resulted in the isolation of a single 220-kDa heparan sulfate proteoglycan (4.Saxena U. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17516-17521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of LPL to cultured endothelial cells can be reduced by removing HSPGs from the surface of cells (5.Cheng C.F. Oosta G.M. Bensadoun A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol.

The ability of GPIHBP1-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells to bind LPL was intriguing, but its significance in vivo remains unclear. On one hand, the increased LPL binding to GPIHBP1-expressing cells might actually represent a major clue regarding the actual in vivo function of GPIHBP1. On the other hand, a skeptic could argue that the increased LPL binding to cultured cells is simply an in vitro artifact resulting from the overexpression of a highly negatively charged protein on the surface of cells. Physiologists have long recognized that an intravenous injection of heparin releases LPL from its binding sites, allowing it to enter the plasma and circulate in the bloodstream (6.Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 215: 15-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that the intravascular pool of LPL, the pool of LPL bound to the surface of endothelial cells, would likely be released quickly after an injection of heparin. We hypothesized that if GPIHBP1 on endothelial cells truly plays a significant role in binding LPL in vivo, then the kinetics of LPL appearance in the plasma after heparin might differ in Gpihbp1–/– and control mice. Similarly, we hypothesized that the release of LPL into the plasma after an injection of a triglyceride emulsion (i.e. Intralipid) would be abnormal in Gpihbp1–/– mice. In the current study, we tested these hypotheses. Genetically Modified Mice—Gpihbp1–/– mice (>90% C57BL/6, <10% 129/Sv) have been described previously (8.Beigneux A. Davies B. Gin P. Weinstein M.

Blood Collection and Processing—Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and blood was collected by retroorbital puncture with a heparinized mylar-coated glass capillary (Drummond Scientific Company) and a heparin-treated microtainer tube (BD Biosciences). After sedimenting red blood cells by centrifugation (6000 × g for 2 min), plasma was separated and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Plasma samples were stored at –80 °C. Triglyceride and cholesterol levels were measured on plasma samples with the Serum Triglyceride Determination Kit (Sigma) and Cholesterol E kit (Wako). LPL mass in plasma was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with immunopurified goat antibodies against mouse LPL (15.Page S. Judson A. Melford K. Bensadoun A. J. Biol.

Bacterial extracts were applied to a TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), and bound LPL was eluted with a 60-ml linear gradient of imidazole (0–250 mm). LPL was further purified by preparative gel electrophoresis and electroelution. The purity of the electroeluted LPL was monitored by SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing a single band were pooled and used to immunize a goat. The identity of the electroeluted protein was confirmed by sequencing of tryptic peptides by mass spectroscopy. The mouse LPL was also coupled to an Affi-Prep 10 matrix (Bio-Rad) for immunoglobulin purification. To generate immunopurified high affinity goat antibodies, 2.0 ml of goat serum was diluted 3-fold with a high-salt equilibration buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0) and applied to the mouse LPL affinity column at a rate of 0.2 ml/min. The column was washed with 120 ml of equilibration buffer, and LPL was eluted with a low-pH buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.8). Immunoglobulins were stored at –20 °C in 50% glycerol. The protein concentration of immunoglobulin fractions was measured as described previously (17.Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). To measure LPL levels, plasma samples were first preincubated in 1.2 m guanidium HCl, 0.8 m NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were then diluted to 0.24 m guanidium HCl prior to transfer to microtiter wells coated with capture immunoglobulins specific for mouse LPL (1 μg/well). The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C and the microtiter wells were then washed with an automated plate washer six times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. This was followed by an incubation with biotinylated goat anti-mouse LPL immunoglobulins overnight at 4 °C. The microtiter wells were then washed nine times and subsequently incubated with streptavidin-coupled horseradish peroxidase for 2 h at 37 °C. The nonspecifically bound streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was then removed by washing 12 times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 before color development with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and reading at OD490. The multiple washes at every step contributed to a low blank value (OD490 = 0.056 ± 0.005, n = 3) that was subtracted from each reading. A standard curve ranging from 0.02 to 2.0 ng of recombinant mouse LPL was included on each microtiter plate, with the 2 ng of sample giving an OD490 of 0.921 ± 0.060 (n = 3). The standard curve was fitted to a quadratic function (r = 0.998 ± 0.0002, n = 3). We considered the possibility that the immunoassay might be affected by the high plasma lipoprotein levels in Gpihbp1–/– mice. To explore this possibility, we “spiked” postheparin plasma from wild-type mice with either normal saline or the d < 1.006 g/ml lipoproteins from Gpihbp1–/– mice (so as to bring the plasma triglyceride concentrations to the level observed in Gpihbp1–/– mice). The d < 1.006 g/ml lipoproteins were prepared by ultracentrifugation and did not contain detectable levels of LPL, as judged by immunoblotting. The LPL levels in samples spiked with normal saline and those spiked with d < 1.006 g/ml lipoproteins were similar, providing no evidence that chylomicrons systematically lower plasma LPL mass measurements. Release of LPL into the Plasma with Intravenous Injections or Heparin or Intralipid—Age- and sex-matched Gpihbp1–/–, Gpihbp1+/–, and Gpihbp1+/+ mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and sodium heparin (Baxter) (0.5–50 units in 150 μl of 0.9% sodium chloride) was injected into the caudal vein. In some experiments, mice were injected with 7.5 ml/kg 20% Intralipid (18.Hansen L.M. Hardie B.S. Hidalgo J. Ann. Surg. 1976; 184: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Blood samples were collected for LPL mass measurements and LPL specific activity measurements during the next 15 min. Plasma triglyceride levels in response to heparin were assessed in multiple experiments. In one experiment, Gpihbp1–/– mice were given an initial injection of 100 units of heparin both subcutaneously and intraperitoneally, followed by an additional 100 units of heparin subcutaneously 90 min later. Control mice were given the same volumes of normal saline. Plasma triglyceride levels were measured at multiple time points. In another experiment, a single dose of heparin (50 units) was given intravenously, and plasma triglyceride levels were measured at multiple time points. In a third experiment, subcutaneous heparin (100 units) was given at baseline and 8 and 16 h later, and plasma triglyceride levels were measured at multiple time points. Assessing LPL Specific Activity—To determine the specific activity of LPL, 200 μl of plasma was collected 1 or 15 min after an injection of heparin (50 units), diluted with an equal volume of buffer A (0.25 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5) containing 30% glycerol and 1% bovine serum albumin, and applied to a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 15 ml of buffer A. Hepatic lipase and LPL in the plasma were eluted with a 0.25 to 1.5 m NaCl gradient in buffer A (19.Bensadoun A. Ehnholm C. Steinberg D. Brown W.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2220-2227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty fractions were collected, and lipase activity in each fraction was determined with a [3H]triolein substrate (500,000 cpm/μm) by the method of Hocquette et al. (20.Hocquette J.F. Graulet B. Olivecrona T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 121: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The LPL activity peak spanned 5 of the 30 fractions. The LPL mass in each of the five fractions was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (15.Page S. Judson A. Melford K. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13931-13938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). LPL specific activity in each of the 5 fractions was expressed as nanomole of fatty acid released/h/ng of LPL. Measurement of LPL in Tissues—Mice were fasted overnight. After restoring food for 1 h, the mice were fasted for 4 h before being euthanized for tissue collection (gonadal fat pad, liver, heart, and skeletal muscle). Tissues samples were collected and weighed. A total of 100 mg of tissue was homogenized with a Fisher Scientific PowerGen 125 in 1.0 ml of lysis solution composed of 25 mm ammonium chloride, pH 8.2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.8% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 5 units/ml heparin, 10 mm 6-o-(N-heptylcarbamoyl)-methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.017 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were collected and stored at –80 °C. Mouse LPL levels in these samples were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described earlier. To determine the effect of heparin on tissue LPL levels, mice were injected with either 50 units of sodium heparin in 150 μl of 0.9% sodium chloride or the sodium chloride solution alone. The mice were euthanized 2 min later. Before the tissue was collected, the mice were perfused for 4 min with 0.9% sodium chloride. Tissue LPL levels were then measured as described earlier. Statistical Analysis—All results are shown as the mean ± S.E. Differences in plasma LPL levels were analyzed with a Student's t test (Microsoft Excel) or with a repeated measures analysis of variance test (SAS/STAT software). Comparisons of Gpihbp1+/+, Gpihbp1+/–, and Gpihbp1–/– mice were analyzed with a three-way analysis of variance test. All statistical analyses were reviewed by the Department of Biomathematics at UCLA. Plasma Lipid Levels in GPIHBP1-deficient Mice—The plasma triglyceride levels in chow-fed Gpihbp1–/– mice (>8 weeks old) were 2872 ± 245 (n = 15), and the plasma was grossly lipemic. The plasma triglyceride levels in Gpihbp1+/– mice (31.8 ± 5.8, n = 17) were far lower and similar to those in Gpihbp1+/+ mice (32.8 ± 8.7, n = 7) (p < 0.00001 compared with Gpihbp1–/– mice). The plasma cholesterol levels in Gpihbp1–/– mice were 480 ± 51.9, far higher than in Gpihbp1+/+ and Gpihbp1+/– mice (79.7 ± 6.1 and 87.2 ± 5.8, respectively) (p < 0.00001 compared with Gpihbp1–/– mice). Body weights of the three groups of mice were not significantly different. Delayed Appearance of LPL into the Plasma after an Intravenous Injection of Heparin—We hypothesized that the GPIHBP1 in capillaries could play a physiologic role in binding LPL in vivo, and further hypothesized that the kinetics of LPL appearance in the plasma after an injection of heparin might differ in Gpihbp1–/– and control mice. LPL release after intravenous heparin was examined in 10–16-week-old Gpihbp1+/+ (n = 7), Gpihbp1+/– (n = 9), and Gpihbp1–/– (n = 7) mice. The appearance of LPL in the plasma after intravenous heparin was delayed in Gpihbp1–/– mice (Fig. 1A). Plasma LPL levels in Gpihbp1–/– mice were significantly lower than those in Gpihbp1+/– and Gpihbp1+/+ mice at baseline (p = 0.015) and 1 and 3 min after heparin (p = 0.000001 and 0.00003, respectively) (Fig. 1A), although the plasma LPL levels were similar at the 15-min time point. The change in LPL levels between the earliest (1-min) and latest (15-min) time points was significantly greater in Gpihbp1–/– mice than in Gpihbp1+/+ and Gpihbp1+/– mice (p = 4.26 × 10–6) (Fig. 1B). These differences in the kinetics of LPL release after heparin in adult mice were highly reproducible. In two additional experiments, LPL levels early after heparin administration were substantially different in Gpihbp1–/– mice and control mice. In both experiments, the differences in plasma LPL levels between the earliest time point and the 15-min time point were very large and achieved high degrees of statistical significance (p = 0.0002 and p < 0.00001 in the two experiments). The lower LPL levels at early time points in Gpihbp1–/– mice were not an immunoassay artifact resulting from lipemia, as “spiking” chylomicrons (from Gpihbp1–/– plasma) into wild-type mouse plasma did not lower LPL mass measurements (not shown). Given the slow release of LPL into the plasma of Gpihbp1–/– mice after heparin (Fig. 1), we predicted that the plasma triglyceride levels in Gpihbp1–/– mice would not fall rapidly in the first 15 min after intravenous heparin. Indeed, plasma triglyceride levels were minimally altered, if at all, in Gpihbp1–/– mice in the first 15 min after heparin (Fig. 2A). We also predicted that we would observe very different results in wild-type mice, where the release of LPL into the plasma after heparin was very prompt. Indeed, when wild-type mice were given Intralipid (so as to acutely increase plasma triglyceride levels) and heparin, the plasma triglyceride levels fell from 2573 ± 964 to 11 ± 3 mg/dl within 10 min (p < 0.00001 between the 1- and 10-min time points) (Fig. 2B). This dramatic drop in triglyceride levels is consistent with the rapid release of LPL in wild-type mice (Fig. 1). Even without heparin, the plasma triglyceride levels in wild-type mice fell dramatically in the first 10 min after an injection of Intralipid (Fig. 2B). We suspected that the differences in the kinetics of LPL entry into plasma might disappear with lower doses of heparin, but this was not the case. When 0.5, 2, or 10 units of heparin were administered to age- and sex-matched Gpihbp1–/– and Gpihbp1+/– mice, a similar pattern was observed, with delayed appearance of LPL in Gpihbp1–/– mice and a greater increase in plasma LPL levels between the 1- and 15-min time points (Fig. 3). We considered the possibility that the differences in the kinetics of LPL release were somehow secondary to the lipemia in Gpihbp1–/– mice rather than to the absence of GPIHBP1 per se. To explore this issue, we examined the kinetics of LPL release after injecting 50 units of heparin intravenously into young (<6-week-old) Gpihbp1–/– mice, which have no visible lipemia and have far lower plasma triglyceride levels (409 ± 60 mg/dl, n = 5). Despite lower lipid levels, the delayed appearance of LPL after heparin in Gpihbp1–/– mice was equally apparent (Fig. 4). LPL Mass and Activity in Gpihbp1–/– and Control Mice—LPL levels in the postheparin plasma of Gpihbp1–/– and control mice were similar at the 15-min time point (Fig. 1), suggesting that Gpihbp1–/– mice do not have lower tissue stores of LPL. Indeed, LPL mass levels in the gonadal fat, liver, heart, and quadriceps muscle of Gpihbp1+/+, Gpihbp1+/–, and Gpihbp1–/– mice were similar (Fig. 5A). LPL mass levels in tissues did not change appreciably after an injection of heparin (Fig. 5B). We considered the possibility that the LPL released early (1 min) or late (15 min) after an injection of heparin may have been enzymatically inactive, either in Gpihbp1–/– or control mice, but this was not the case. Plasma samples from Gpihbp1–/– and Gpihbp1+/+ mice (n = 2/group) obtained 1 and 15 min after an injection of heparin were fractionated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography, and LPL activity and mass levels were measured in fractions corresponding to the LPL peak. After dividing LPL activity by LPL mass, some variations in LPL specific activity were observed, but no consistent differences were observed (Fig. 6). LPL Release Kinetics after Heparin in Mice with a Deficiency of Endothelial Cell Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans—Many studies have suggested that endothelial cell HSPGs could be an important binding site for LPL (3.Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether mice lacking heparan sulfate chains in endothelial cells might also have an abnormal pattern of LPL release after heparin. Wang et al. (14.Wang L. Fuster M. Sriramarao P. Esko J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) recently used Cre/loxP recombination techniques to create mice lacking GlcNAc N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 1 (NDST1) in endothelial cells (Ndst1fl/flTekCre+ mice). NDST1 is a key enzyme in the sulfation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. They documented a substantial decrease in the sulfation of HSPGs in the microvascular endothelial cells of these mice and showed that the reduced sulfation of HSPGs led to impaired L-selectin- and chemokine-mediated neutrophil trafficking (14.Wang L. Fuster M. Sriramarao P. Esko J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Plasma triglyceride levels in Ndst1fl/flTekCre+ mice were not perturbed. Nevertheless, we tested the possibility that reduced sulfation of HSPGs in endothelial cells might alter the kinetics of LPL release after heparin. We detected no effect of the knock-out on LPL release; the changes in plasma LPL levels between 1 and 15 min after heparin were similar in Ndst1fl/flTekCre+ mice and littermate control mice (Ndst1fl/fl) (Fig. 7). Reduced Levels of LPL in Gpihbp1–/– Mice after the Injection of a Triglyceride Emulsion (Intralipid)—An intravenous injection of Intralipid releases LPL into the circulation (6.Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 215: 15-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Intralipid particles are large (200–1000 nm in diameter) (18.Hansen L.M. Hardie B.S. Hidalgo J. Ann. Surg. 1976; 184: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), they would not be expected to leav"

Using SHP as a model gene, we studied how FXR activity is regulated by p300 acetylase. FXR interaction with p300 and their recruitment to the SHP promoter and acetylated histone levels at the promoter were increased by FXR agonists in mouse liver and HepG2 cells. In contrast, p300 recruitment and acetylated histones at the promoter were not detected in FXR-null mice. p300 directly interacted with and acetylated FXR in vitro. Overexpression of p300 wild type increased, whereas a catalytically inactive p300 mutant decreased, acetylated FXR levels and FXR transactivation in cells. While similar results were observed with a related acetylase, CBP, GCN5 did not enhance FXR transactivation, and its recruitment to the promoter was not increased by FXR agonists, suggesting functional specificity of acetylases in FXR signaling. Down-regulation of p300 by siRNA decreased acetylated FXR and acetylated histone levels, and occupancy of FXR at the promoter, resulting in substantial inhibition of SHP expression. These results indicate that p300 acts as a critical coactivator of FXR induction of SHP by acetylating histones at the promoter and FXR itself. Surprisingly, p300 down-regulation altered expression of other metabolic FXR target genes involved in lipoprotein and glucose metabolism, such that beneficial lipid and glucose profiles would be expected.

SHP inhibits the transcription of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), a key enzyme in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the classical bile acid biosynthetic pathway (10.Chiang J.Y.L.

Although such important biological roles of FXR have now been established, molecular mechanisms by which FXR activity is modulated are largely unknown. Nuclear receptors, including FXR, collaborate with a number of transcriptional cofactors to effectively modulate transcription of their target genes (18.Rosenfeld M. Glass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36865-36868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 19.Lazar M.A. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2003; 1: 2001Crossref Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that FXR activity is modulated by a metabolic coactivator, PGC-1α (PPARγ coactivator α) in response to fasting (20.Zhang Y. Castellani L.W. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Edwards P.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). PGC-1α enhances FXR gene transcription by coactivation of PPARγ and HNF-4 (hepatic nuclear factor 4) and also acts as a coactivator of FXR (20.Zhang Y. Castellani L.W. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J.

Whether these cofactors identified from in vitro and cultured cell studies could regulate FXR activity in metabolic pathways in vivo needs to be established. The transcription cofactor p300 functions in diverse biological pathways, including differentiation, development, and proliferation (24.Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

SHP is an unusual orphan nuclear receptor, which lacks a DNA binding domain but contains a putative ligand binding domain (30.Seol W. Choi H. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). SHP interacts with and inhibits the activity of numerous nuclear receptors that are involved in regulation of diverse metabolic pathways (31.Lee Y. Moore D.D. J. Biol.

We recently reported that bile acid-induced SHP inhibits transcription of its target genes, including CYP7A1, by coordinately recruiting chromatin-modifying cofactors, such as mSin3A/HDACs corepressors, G9a histone lysine methyltransferase, and Swi/Snf-Brm remodeling complex to the promoter, resulting in chromatin remodeling and histone modification (32.Kemper J.

Marked alterations in cholesterol and bile acid levels in SHP-null mice have established a role for SHP in lipid homeostasis (35.Kerr T.A. Saeki S. Schneider M. Schaefer K. Berdy S. Redder T. Shan B.

Interestingly, chronically elevated expression of SHP has been shown to associate with development of fatty liver and related metabolic disorders (37.Boulias K. Katrakili N. Bamberg K. Underhill P.

Despite the established function of SHP in maintaining cholesterol and bile acid levels in health and disease states, how SHP is induced by bile acid-activated FXR remains relatively unknown. From molecular, cellular, and mouse in vivo studies, we have obtained evidence indicating that p300 is critically involved in ligand-activated FXR signaling, particularly in SHP gene induction, by acetylating histones at the SHP promoter and FXR itself. Down-regulation of p300 substantially reduced SHP expression and further, altered expression of other hepatic FXR target genes, such that beneficial lipid and glucose profiles would be expected. We propose that inhibition of hepatic p300 activity may be beneficial for treating fatty liver disease and related metabolic disorders. Cell Culture—Human hepatoma HepG2 cells (ATCC HB8065) were grown in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 (1:1). COS-1 cells were grown in DMEM media. Media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G-streptomycin sulfate and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For down-regulation of p300, HepG2 cells were infected with 5-25 MOI of Ad-empty or Ad-sip300, and 2 days later, cells were transfected with reporter and expression plasmids as indicated in the figure legends, and reporter assays were done. Mouse in Vivo Experiments—Eight-week-old male mice were maintained on a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. Cholic acid (CA) feeding was started at 5:00 PM to reduce variability between experiments, and food intake was monitored. For GW4064 experiments, mice were treated with GW4064 (2 mg/20 g mouse in 1% Tween 80 and 1% methylcellulose) or vehicle using oral gavage and 3 h later, livers were collected for further studies. For adenoviral experiments, mice were injected with about 0.5 × 109 active viral particles (Ad-empty, Ad-3Flag-FXR) in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline via the tail vein, and 4-7 days after infection, the mice were fed normal chow or chow supplemented with 0.5% CA for 3-24 h. All the animal use and adenoviral protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use and Institutional Biosafety Committees at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.

Real-time RTPCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent, and cDNA was synthesized and RTPCR was performed with an iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad). The amount of PCR product for each mRNA was normalized by dividing by the amount of 36B4 PCR product. Sequences of the primers are available upon request. In Vitro and in Cell Acetylation Assays—For in vitro acetylation assays, p300, CBP, pCAF, and GCN5, were purified from Sf9 insect cells infected with baculovirus encoding each of these proteins, as described (43.Thomas M.C.

After incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining, and radioactivity was detected by fluorography. To detect acetylated FXR in cells, HepG2 or COS-1 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for p300 (or infected with Ad-p300 wild type), along with Ad-Flag-FXR (5 MOI). Cells were treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors such as 0.5 μm trichostatin A (TSA) and 5 mm nicotinamide (Nam), in the presence of 200 nm GW4064 for 5 h and collected for co-IP assays as described (46.Gu W.

Briefly, 3× Flag-FXR was immunoprecipitated in post-translational modification (PTM) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors, 1 μm TSA, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 10 mm Nam, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and phosphatase inhibitors) with 1 μg of either M2 antibody (Sigma, Inc) or goat FXR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-1204) and immunoprecipitates were stringently washed with PTM buffer. Acetylated Flag-FXR in the immunoprecipitates was detected by Western blotting using acetyl lysine antibody (Cell Signaling, Inc). Membranes were stripped and Flag-FXR was detected by Western blotting using M2 or rabbit FXR (sc-13063) antibody. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) Assays—To examine protein-protein interactions in mouse liver, co-IP assays were performed essentially as described (32.Kemper J. Kim H. Miao J. Bhalla S. Bae Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7707-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34.Fang S. Miao J. Xiang L. Ponugoti B. Treuter E. Kemper J.K. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, 0.25-0.5 mg of mouse liver nuclear extracts was incubated with 1 μg of p300 antibody (sc-584) at 4 °C overnight. The immune complex was isolated by incubation with protein G-agarose, and proteins in the immunoprecipitates were detected by Western blotting. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays in HepG2, normal mice, and FXR-null mice were carried out essentially as described (32.Kemper J. Kim H. Miao J. Bhalla S. Bae Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7707-7719Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34.Fang S. Miao J. Xiang L. Ponugoti B. Treuter E. Kemper J.K. Mol. Cell.

In re-ChIP assays, chromatin was first immunoprecipitated with antisera to FXR and then eluted with 100 μl of elution buffer with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min and then, diluted (25-fold) with dilution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), and re-immunoprecipitated with IgG or p300 antibody. ChIP experiments were repeated at least three times with reproducible results. Sequences of the ChIP primers for mouse and human SHP promoters are available upon request. Cholic Acid Feeding Increases the Interaction of p300 with FXR in Mouse Liver—To determine if the p300 acetylase is involved in bile acid signaling in vivo, we first examined the effects of cholic acid (CA), a primary bile acid and natural FXR agonist, on p300 interaction with FXR in mouse liver. Mice were infected with Ad-Flag-FXR or control Ad-empty and then, fed normal chow or 0.5% CA-supplemented chow for 6 h. In Western analysis of liver extracts, Flag-FXR was not detected in the Ad-empty-infected mice and was present at similar levels in the two Ad-Flag-FXR groups (supplemental Fig. S1). p300 was immunoprecipitated from liver nuclear extracts, and Flag-FXR in the immunoprecipitates was detected by Western blotting. The levels of Flag-FXR were similar in input samples, but were substantially increased in the anti-p300 immunoprecipitates after CA feeding and not detected in the IgG control precipitates (Fig. 1A). We confirmed these results with endogenous FXR without overexpression of Flag-FXR. First, to confirm that CA feeding is operating in vivo, we measured the mRNA levels of Shp, a well known FXR target and metabolic corepressor, and Cyp7a1, a key bile acid biosynthetic enzyme and inhibited by Shp. The mRNA levels of Shp were significantly increased, whereas those of Cyp7a1 were decreased, after 6 h of CA feeding (Fig. 1B). Endogenous FXR was immunoprecipitated with FXR antisera or IgG and p300 was detected. While p300 was not detected in the IgG precipitates, the amount of p300 in the anti-FXR immunoprecipitates was increased by CA feeding (Fig. 1C). Endogenous p300 levels were not changed after 6 h of CA feeding (supplemental Fig. S2). These results indicate that CA feeding increases the interaction of p300 with FXR in mouse liver, suggesting that p300 may be involved in bile acid-activated FXR signaling in vivo. p300 Enhances FXR Transactivation—To determine whether the p300/FXR interaction is functionally relevant, we tested the effects of down-regulation of p300 on FXR activity. Infection with Ad-sip300 decreased the endogenous p300 mRNA levels by 80% in HepG2 cells (supplemental Fig. S3). It was shown that infection with this Ad-sip300 did not reduce mRNA levels of the acetylase CBP, which is highly conserved and functionally related with p300 (44.Kuninger D. Stauffer D. Eftekhari S. Wilson E. Thayer M. Rotwein P. Hum. Gene Ther. 2004; 15: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Expression of FXR and RXRα activated the FXRE reporter in the presence of chenodeoxy cholic acid (CDCA), a primary bile acid, or GW4046, a synthetic FXR agonist (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 9, 16). Infection with increasing amounts of Ad-sip300 progressively and significantly inhibited FXR transactivation (Fig. 2A, lanes 9-22). These results indicate that p300, at endogenous levels, functions as a coactivator of ligand-activated FXR. Because SHP is a well known direct FXR target, we also tested if p300 coactivates FXR transactivation of the natural SHP promoter. Treatment with GW4064 or CDCA substantially increased FXR activity on the SHP promoter (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 9, 16). Ad-sip300 significantly reduced the FXR activity in a dosedependent manner, whereas Ad-empty had little effect (lanes 9-22). These results indicate that p300 functions as a coactivator for FXR transactivation of the SHP promoter. CA Feeding Induces Recruitment of p300 to the Shp Promoter in Mouse Liver—To further determine whether p300 is involved in ligand-activated FXR signaling, we examined whether p300 can be recruited to the SHP promoter after CA feeding. In ChIP assays, FXR was associated with the Shp promoter in livers of control mice, and CA feeding significantly increased FXR occupancy at the promoter (Fig. 3, A and B). CA feeding also substantially increased recruitment of p300 to the promoter (Fig. 3A). Consistent with p300 recruitment, acetylation of histone H3 at K9/K14, a gene activation histone mark, was increased. These effects were not observed for the control Gapdh sequence (Fig. 3A). To monitor temporal association of FXR and p300 with the Shp promoter, time course ChIP assays were done. To confirm that CA feeding effectively altered expression of the Shp gene, mRNA levels were monitored by q-RTPCR. The Shp mRNA levels were increased by about 2-fold as early as 6 h of CA feeding (supplemental Fig. S4). Association of FXR with the promoter was detected in livers of untreated mice and was increased by 6 h after CA feeding (Fig. 3C). p300 was recruited to the Shp promoter at 3 h of CA feeding and reached a maximum at 6 h. Consistent with p300 recruitment, acetylated histone H3 levels were increased after CA feeding (Fig. 3C). To determine whether the p300 recruitment was dependent on FXR, we performed ChIP assays in FXR-null mice and normal mice in parallel. It has been demonstrated that Shp expression was substantially reduced in FXR-null mice fed either control chow or CA-supplemented chow (7.Sinal C. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). In FXR-null mice, association of FXR was not observed, as expected, and the association of p300, acetylated histones, and RNA polymerase II was also largely eliminated (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that recruitment of p300 to the Shp promoter is FXR-dependent. Interestingly, association of RXR was observed in wild type and FXR-null mice independent of CA feeding, suggesting that another nuclear receptor that can form a heterodimer with RXR was present at the promoter. Ligand-regulated FXR Induction of SHP in HepG2 Cells—The mechanism of p300-mediated coactivation of FXR signaling was studied in more detail in HepG2 cells. The effects of FXR ligands on the levels of acetylated histones at the SHP promoter were first studied to determine if FXR activation resulted in the same histone modification in HepG2 cells as in vivo. Acetylated histone H3 K9/K14 was detected in untreated cells, and the levels were increased after treatment with CDCA, and even more dramatically by treatment with GW4046 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, co-treatment with the reported FXR antagonist, gugglesterone (53.Urizar N.L. Liverm"

The amyloidogenic, but not amyloidolytic, metabolism of APP was selectively increased in the brain of mutant mice lacking X11L (Sano, Y., Syuzo-Takabatake, A., Nakaya, T., Saito, Y., Tomita, S., Itohara, S., and Suzuki, T. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 37853–37860). To reveal the actual role of X11 proteins (X11s) in suppressing amyloidogenic cleavage of APP in vivo, we generated X11 and X11L double knock-out mice and analyzed the metabolism of APP. The mutant mice showed enhanced β-site cleavage of APP along with increased accumulation of Aβ in brain and increased colocalization of APP with β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE). In the brains of mice deficient in both X11 and X11L, the apparent relative subcellular distributions of both mature APP and its β-C-terminal fragment were shifted toward the detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fraction, an organelle in which BACE is active and both X11s are not nearly found. These results indicate that X11s associate primarily with APP molecules that are outside of DRM, that the dissociation of APP-X11/X11L complexes leads to entry of APP into DRM, and that cleavage of uncomplexed APP by BACE within DRM is enhanced by X11s deficiency. Present results lead to an idea that the dysfunction of X11L in the interaction with APP may recruit more APP into DRM and increase the generation of Aβ even if BACE activity did not increase in brain.

The production, aggregation, and deposition of Aβ are widely believed to be central to the pathogenesis in AD (reviewed in Ref. 1Gandy S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1121-1129PubMed Google Scholar). APP is subjected to two types of cleavage in both a potentially amyloidogenic pathway and an amyloidolytic (or nonamyloiodgenic) pathway. Amyloidogenic cleavage of APP is mediated by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (β-secretase or BACE), which generates the C-terminal fragment CTFβ, which contains an intact Aβ sequence, whereas amyloidolytic cleavage of APP is mediated by one of several α-site APP-cleaving enzymes (α-secretases, including ADAM10 and ADAM17), thereby generating CTFα, which contains only the C-terminal half of Aβ peptide (reviewed in Refs. 1Gandy S.

These CTFs are further cleaved within the transmembrane domain by the γ-secretase aspartyl protease complex composed of presenilin (PS), nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2. The γ-secretase cleavage generates Aβ and the APP intracellular domain from CTFβ and, alternatively, γ-secretase generates p3 peptide and APP intracellular domain from CTFα (reviewed in Refs. 3Selkoe D.J.

However, it is still unclear exact where along the intracellular trafficking itinerary of APP each of these cleavages occurs. The molecular mechanisms regulating secretase reactions are also poorly understood (reviewed in Ref. 5Small S.A. Gandy S.

X11s are composed of an independent N-terminal half, a conserved central phosphotyrosine interaction domain, and two C-terminal PDZ domains. X11 and X11L are largely brain-specific, whereas X11L2 is expressed ubiquitously (reviewed in Ref. 16Miller C.C. McLoughlin D.M. Lau K.F. Tennant M.E. Rogeli B.

Transgenic mice expressing the APP Swedish mutation and also overexpressing X11 or X11L show a decreased level of cerebral Aβ and a reduction of Aβ plaques in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in comparison with the mice expressing Swedish mutant APP alone (20Lee J.H.

Conversely, the amyloidogenic metabolism of endogenous APP and the generation of Aβ are facilitated in the brains of X11L-deficient mice (22Sano Y. Syuzo-Takabatake A. Nakaya T. Saito Y. Tomita S. Itohara S. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37853-37860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These previous observations indicate that X11 and X11L work to suppress the amyloidogenic metabolism of APP selectively, although it is still unclear how X11 and X11L function in the regulation of APP metabolism in the intact brain. To address these issues, we generated X11 and X11L genes homozygous doubly deficient (X11-/-, X11L-/-) mice by crossing X11 gene-deficient (X11-/-) mice with X11L gene-deficient (X11L-/-) mice. We report here that the doubly deficient mice show increased levels of CTFβ and Aβ in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, apparently because of the relatively increased colocalization of vesicles containing both APP and BACE1 in neurites of primary cultured neurons and that of APP and CTFβ in DRM in brain when compared with what occurs in wild-type mice. These results provide evidence that X11 proteins suppress translocation of APP into BACE- and γ-secretase-rich DRM domains, raising the possibility that dysfunction of X11 proteins might play a role in the pathogenesis of AD even if the BACE activity did not increase in AD patients. Generation of X11/X11L Doubly Deficient Mice—All of the animal studies were conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Animal Studies Committee of Hokkaido University. The original X11-deficient mice were hybrids of 129/Sv and C57BL/6 (23Mori A. Okuyama K. Horie M. Taniguchi Y. Wadatsu T. Nishino N. Shimada Y. Miyazawa N. Takeda S. Niimi M. Kyushiki H. Kondo M. Mitsumoto Y. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 43: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This line was further backcrossed to C57BL/6 line over 10 times during 6 years in our laboratory. X11L gene knock-out mice were generated coisogenic to C57BL/6 and backcrossed to same strain over 10 times during 7 years (22Sano Y. Syuzo-Takabatake A. Nakaya T. Saito Y. Tomita S. Itohara S. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37853-37860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The respective deficient mutant mice were mated to generate the [X11+/-, X11L+/-] heterozygous mutant line. The heterozygous mutant mice were further mated to generate [X11+/-, X11L-/-] and [X11-/-, X11L+/-] mutant mice. To obtain [X11-/-, X11L-/-] doubly mutant mice, we crossed [X11+/-, X11L-/-] and/or [X11-/-, X11L+/-] mutant mice, respectively (supplemental Table S1). The genotype was determined by PCR analysis of the genomic DNA prepared from the tails. PCR product of 250 and 540 bp are detected from wild-type and knock-out mutant alleles of X11, and those of 550 and 310 bp are detected from wild-type and knock-out mutant alleles of X11L (supplemental Fig. S1). We planned mating schedules as shown (supplemental Table S1). Because offspring with the X11/X11L doubly deficient genotype showed unexpected numbers when their genotyping was performed at postnatal day 28, we performed the genotyping of individuals at postnatal day 0 and embryonic days 18.5 and 15.5. Antibodies—Polyclonal anti-X11 rabbit UT153 antibody was raised against a peptide that is composed of Cys plus the sequence between position 235 and 252 (C+LHHYDERSDGESDSPEKE) of human X11. The specificity was examined by immunoblotting and immunostaining (supplemental Fig. S2). Monoclonal anti-BACE1 antibody BACE-Cat1 (3D5) was described (24Zhao J. Fu Y. Yasvoina M. Shao P. Hitt B.

Polyclonal anti-APP cytoplasmic domain G369 antibody was described (25Oishi M. Nairn A.C. Czernik A.J. Lim G.S. Isohara T. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. Suzuki T. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 111-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-X11/mint1, anti-X11L/mint2, anti-X11L2/mint3, anti-microtubule-associated protein 2, and anti-flotillin-1 antibodies were purchased from BD Bioscience. Monoclonal anti-APP extracellular domain 22C11 (Chemicon), anti-actin (Chemicon), anti-PS1 C-terminal (Chemicon), anti-α-tubulin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-sAPPα 2B3 (IBL), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (PROGEN) and anti-synaptophysin (DAKO), and polyclonal anti-APP cytoplasmic domain 8717 (Sigma), anti-sAPPβ (IBL), and anti-calnexin (Stressgen Biotechnologies) antibodies were purchased. Immunoblot Analysis—The mouse brains were homogenized in 8-volume of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1! (w/v) SDS, a protease inhibitor mixture (5 μg/ml chymostatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin), and 1 μm microcystin-LR and then lysed by sonication in ice. The resulted supernatant was used for immunoblot analysis. In a separate study, the brain tissues were homogenized in 8-volume of buffer A (10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose) containing a protease inhibitor mixture and 1 μm microcystin-LR with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation twice at 1,000 × g for 10 min of homogenate, the post-nuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The precipitated membrane fraction (P100) was solubilized in 8 volumes of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1! (w/v) SDS by sonication. This P100 was used to detect APP CTFs, and the supernatant (S100) was used to detect sAPP in immunoblot analysis. The immunoreactants were detected using ECL plus detection system (GE Healthcare) and quantified with a Versa Doc model 3000 (Bio-Rad). Immunohistochemistry—Mouse brain tissue sections were prepared and incubated with primary antibodies as described (22Sano Y. Syuzo-Takabatake A. Nakaya T. Saito Y. Tomita S. Itohara S. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37853-37860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and further incubated with horse anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to biotin (Vector Laboratories), followed by the ABC complex (peroxidase activity was revealed using diaminobenzidine as the chromogen) or goat anti-mouse IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 or goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 546 in PBS containing 5! (v/v) horse and goat serum for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were viewed using Axioplan 2 microscope or the confocal laser scanning microscope LSM510 (Carl Zeiss). Neuronal Culture and Immunocytochemistry—The primary culture of cortical neurons was described (26Araki Y. Kawano T. Taru H. Saito Y. Wada S. Miyamoto K. Kobayashi H. Ishikawa H.O. Ohsugi Y. Yamamoto T. Matsuno K. Kinjyo M. Suzuki T. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In short, the cortex of mice at embryonic day 15.5 was dissected, and neurons were spread in a buffer containing papain and cultured at 5 × 104 cells/cm2 in Neurobasal medium containing B27, Glutamax, and antibiotics (Invitrogen) on poly-d-lysine-treated glasses. At in vitro day 7, the neurons were fixed with methanol at -20 °C. After thorough washing with PBS containing 0.1! Triton X-100 (PBS-X), neurons were blocked with PBS-X containing 3! (v/v) goat and 3! (v/v) horse serum (blocking solution). Primary antibodies (mouse monoclonal anti-BACE1 antibody BACE-Cat1 (3D5) and rabbit polyclonal anti-APP cytoplasmic domain G369) were incubated for overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution. The neurons were then washed three times with PBS-X and incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 or goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 546) in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. The neurons were washed with PBS-X and mounted onto slides with Shandon IMMU-MOUNT (Thermo). The neurons were observed using the BZ-9000 microscope (KEYENCE). Quantification of Aβ40 and Aβ42—Mouse endogenous Aβ40 and Aβ42 were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co., Osaka, Japan) described previously (22Sano Y. Syuzo-Takabatake A. Nakaya T. Saito Y. Tomita S. Itohara S. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37853-37860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hippocampus (tissues from three mice were combined in each assay) and cerebral cortex (tissues from one mouse) dissected from 12-month-old mice were used. Isolation of DRM—DRM fractions were prepared according to the established procedure with minor modifications (27Sawamura N. Morishima-Kawashima M. Waki H. Kobayashi K. Kuramochi T. Frosch M.P. Ding K. Ito M. Kim T.W. Tanzi R.E. Oyama F. Tabira T. Ando S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27901-27908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cortex from each mouse (8–12 weeks old) or its P100 fraction was homogenized in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1! (v/v) Triton X-100, a protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 μm microcystin-LR. The sucrose concentration of the extract was adjusted to 42.5! (w/v) by the addition of 85! sucrose in TNE buffer; the extract was then placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with a 5! (1 ml), 10! (1 ml), 20! (3 ml), and 30! (3 ml) discontinuous sucrose gradient in TNE. The gradients were centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 20 h with SW41 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top of the ultracentrifuge tubes, and proteins in respective fractions were analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Generation of X11 and X11L Doubly Deficient Mice and Expression of X11 Proteins in Wild-type Mouse Brain—Although the X11 and X11L doubly deficient mice (X11-/-, X11L-/-) genotypes of embryos followed standard Mendelian genetics (supplemental Table S1), ∼50! of the doubly deficient mice were weaker and paler than littermates and died at postnatal day 0 with little or no milk in their stomachs. The doubly deficient (X11-/-, X11L-/-) mice survived but were significantly smaller in size when compared with the wild-type (X11+/+, X11L+/+), X11-deficient (X11-/-, X11L+/+), or X11L-deficient (X11+/+, X11L-/-) mice at all ages examined (supplemental Fig. S1). The same phenotype was reported in the mutant mice produced as an independent line (28Ho A. Morishita W. Atasoy D. Liu X. Tabuchi K. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Sudhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13089-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We used these survivors in further analysis of APP metabolism. Prior to biochemical analysis of APP metabolism, we examined brain morphology, and expression and distribution of APP, X11s, and some standard neuronal proteins (supplemental Fig. S3). No remarkable abnormality was observed in overall brain structure and regional structures (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that no major developmental abnormalities occurred in the X11 and X11L doubly deficient mice. No differences were observed for expression and localization of APP, microtubule-associated protein 2B, glial fibrillary acidic protein, or synaptophysin in the hippocampal CA1 region of wild-type and doubly deficient mouse brain (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that no gliosis, synaptic loss, or dendritic atrophy was detectable in brains of the X11 and X11L doubly deficient mice. Because deletion of one X11 family protein did not induce the compensatory expression of other family proteins (supplemental Fig. S3), we first confirmed the expression profile of X11s in brain regions (supplemental Fig. S4). It is well analyzed that APP is ubiquitously expressed in brain tissues including hippocampus and cerebral cortex (29Ouimet C.C. Baerwald K.D. Gandy S.E. Greengard P. J. Ciomp. Neurol. 1994; 348: 244-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which are regions suffering from neurodegeneration in human AD. Immunoblot analysis showed that X11s expressed in various brain tissues along with APP, although X11L is relatively abundant in olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, thalamus/hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum when compared with other regions (supplemental Fig. S4) (30McLoughlin D.M. Irving N.G. Brownlees J. Brion J.-P. Leroy K. Miller C. C.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1988-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Localization of neuron-specific X11 and X11L was examined in hippocampus and cerebral cortex by immunostaining (supplemental Fig. S4). Interestingly, distinct expression between X11 and X11L was observed; X11L was largely expressed in the pyramidal neurons, whereas X11 was expressed in other types of neurons. These results suggest that X11 and X11L function in different neurons but in the same roles for APP metabolism as shown in many studies (17Borg J.P. Yang Y.N. De Taddeo-Borg M. Margolis B.

Leroy K. Miller C. C.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1988-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); thus biochemical analysis with lysate of the X11 and X11L doubly deficient mice brain allows accurate determination of X11s function in APP metabolism. Enhanced β-Cleavage of APP in the Hippocampus and the Cerebral Cortex of the X11 and X11L Doubly Deficient Mice—Amyloidogenic metabolism of APP is facilitated as illustrated by the elevation of CTFβ levels in X11L-deficient mice (22Sano Y. Syuzo-Takabatake A. Nakaya T. Saito Y. Tomita S. Itohara S. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37853-37860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether X11 shows the same proamyloidogenic activity as X11L and whether the X11/X11L doubly deficient mice facilitate the amyloidogenic metabolism of APP beyond that observed with either X11 or X11L singly. To address these issues, we first quantified APP CTFs in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the X11-deficient (X11-/-, X11L+/+) mice and the X11/X11L doubly deficient (X11-/-, X11L-/-) mouse brains along with those of the wild-type (X11+/+, X11L+/+) mice and the X11L-deficient (X11+/+, X11L-/-) mouse brains (Fig. 1). Quantitative accuracy for the amount of APP-CTFs detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-APP C-terminal antibody (antibody 8171; Sigma) was examined (supplemental Fig. S5). Quantification by this procedure is reliable with a dose-dependent reactivity by the antibody. APP α-secretase produces CTFα, which is composed of C-terminal 83 amino acids (C83), whereas β-secretase or BACE generates two CTFβ, C99 and C89 (31Liu K. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3128-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because CTFs are phosphorylated at Thr668 residue in brain, six CTF species can be detected as five protein bands by immunoblotting (see schematic picture in Fig. 1A); phosphorylated C99 (pC99), C99, pC89, a mixture of C89 and pC83, and C83 (reviews in Ref. 32Suzuki T. Nakaya T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29633-29637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33Sano Y. Nakaya T. Pedrini S. Takeda S. Iijima-Ando K. Iijima K. Mathews P.M. Itohara S. Gandy S. Suzuki T. PLoS ONE. 2006; 1: e51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To simplify the quantification of each CTFs (C99, C89, and C83), respective CTFs were subjected to dephosphorylation with λ protein phosphatase as described (34Nakaya T. Suzuki T. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the levels of dephosphorylated CTFs in hippocampus (Fig. 1B) and cerebral cortex (Fig. 1C) were determined. The band densities were standardized to the density of transferrin receptor, and ratios of CTF/transferrin receptor were generated (right panels in Fig. 1, B and C). When compared with wild-type mice (lane 1), increased levels of the amyloidogenic fragments C89 and C99, but not the nonamyloidogenic fragment C83, were observed in the hippocampi of: 1) X11-deficient mice (lane 2); 2) X11/X11L doubly deficient mice (lane 4); and 3) X11L-deficient mice (column 3) (Fig. 1B). A similar trend toward elevated CTF levels was observed in the cerebral cortex (Fig. 1C), but the increase of CTFβ species in the X11-deficient mice was not significant. We could also verify the increase of C99 in the cortex of X11L-deficient and X11/X11L doubly deficient mice by using anti-C99 N-terminal G530 antibody (35Oishi M. Nairn C.A. Czernik J.A. Lim S.G. Isohara T. Gandy S. Greengard P. Suzuki T. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 111-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S6). G530 antibody specifically recognized the mouse C99 (supplemental Fig. S6), although the titer of G530 was lower than antibody 8717. We quantified C99 in cerebral cortex of the wild-type and X11s-deficient mouse brains by immunoblotting with G530 as did it with antibody 8717 (supplemental Fig. S6). The increased level of C99 quantified with G530 well agreed with that quantified with antibody 8717 in X11s-deficient mice, indicating that quantification of CTF with antibody 8717 is reliable. Therefore, in following experiments, we used antibody 8717 to detect and quantify the brain APP-CTFs. In cerebral cortex, the X11L-deficient mice and the X11/X11L doubly deficient mice showed significantly elevated levels of C89 and C99. The doubly deficient mice showed a less pronounced increase of C83 that was not observed in singly X11 or X11L-deficient mice. These results indicate that, like X11L, X11 also suppresses amyloidogenic metabolism of APP in brain in vivo, although the contribution of X11 to this pathway is apparently less pronounced, maybe by a smaller population of neurons expressing X11 alone, than is the contribution of X11L. X11/X11L doubly deficient mice show an increase in levels of total CTFs in addition to a more specific elevation of CTFβ levels. Therefore, the X11/X11L doubly deficient mice are potentially suitable for studies aimed at elucidating the mechanism by which X11 proteins control Aβ levels. In a previous study of X11L-deficient mouse brains, the levels of sAPP were relatively decreased despite increased levels of CTFβ (22Sano Y. Syuzo-Takabatake A. Nakaya T. Saito Y. Tomita S. Itohara S. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37853-37860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a result that was attributed to the role of X11s in exocytosis (36Ciufo L.F. Barclay J.W. Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 470-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We examined sAPP levels in the brains of X11-deficient mice and the X11/X11L doubly deficient mice (supplemental Fig. S7). Levels of sAPP in the hippocampus (supplemental Fig. S7) and cerebral cortex (supplemental Fig. S7) of X11-deficient mice and the X11/X11L doubly deficient mice were quantified by immunoblot with anti-pan sAPP, anti-sAPPα, and anti-sAPPβ antibodies as were the respective sAPP peptides in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of X11L-decifient mice. As expected and in contrast to the altered levels of CTFs (Fig. 1), the levels of total sAPP, sAPPα, and sAPPβ were significantly decreased in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the doubly deficient mice and of the X11L-deficient mice when compared with those of the wild-type mouse brain. However, sAPP levels in the X11-deficient mice brain were not affected significantly. The decrease of sAPP was more remarkable in the X11/X11L doub"

Three highly conserved and tissue-specific TGF-β isoforms signal through heteromeric complexes of three cell surface receptors, the type III TGF-β receptor (TβRIII, or betaglycan), the type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII), and the type I TGF-β receptor (TβRI). Although TβRII and TβRI are both transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, TβRIII is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan with a short cytoplasmic tail that fundamentally contributes to TGF-β signaling through mechanisms yet to be defined. TβRIII binds all three forms of TGF-β ligands specifically; TβRII binds TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 independently, whereas TβRI cannot bind ligand on its own. Upon ligand binding, the constitutively active TβRII recruits TβRI into an active heterotetrameric signaling complex composed of two TβRIs and two TβRIIs and transphosphorylates the glycine and serine rich region of TβRI to activate its kinase function (5.Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TβRI can then phosphorylate C-terminal serine residues on transcription factors known as Smads, specifically the receptor-Smads, Smad2 and Smad3, which then associate with the common-Smad, Smad4 (6.Engel M.E. McDonnell M.A. Law B.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37413-37420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). This association allows accumulation of the complex into the nucleus and transcription of target genes. This classical Smad-dependent TGF-β signaling leads to negative regulation of cell proliferation (1.Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4720) Google Scholar, 7.Derynck R. Zhang Y.E.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Because TβRIII lacked a known signaling motif in its cytoplasmic domain and cells could respond to TGF-β in the absence of TβRIII, TβRIII was initially thought to solely function in presenting ligand to TβRII (9.Lopez-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 10.Wang X.F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1991; 67: 797-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent studies have challenged this model, demonstrating an essential role of TβRIII in TGF-β2 signaling (11.Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Pepin M.C. Beauchemin M. Moustakas A. Lodish H.F. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. J. Biol.

Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TβRIII has been highly conserved evolutionarily with 98% identity between rat and human species, suggesting essential roles for this receptor (14.Kirkbride K.C. Blobe G.C. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2003; 3: 251-261PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies by our laboratory and others have demonstrated frequent loss of TβRIII expression at the mRNA and protein level in human cancer tissues, defining a tumor suppressor role for TβRIII in many cancer types, including cancers of the breast (15.Dong M.

TβRIII functions as a tumor suppressor primarily through its ability to inhibit cancer cell motility and invasion, as demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, TβRIII, like other co-receptors, is promiscuous in terms of ligand binding (21.Kirkbride K.C. Ray B.N. Blobe G.C. Trends Biochem.

We have demonstrated that TβRII can phosphorylate TβRIII on its cytoplasmic domain in vivo (25.Chen W. Kirkbride K.C. How T. Nelson C.D. Mo J. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Blobe G.C. Science. 2003; 301: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation, specifically on residue Thr841, promotes association of the scaffolding protein β-arrestin2 and endocytosis of TβRIII and TβRII with subsequent down-regulation of TGF-β signaling (25.Chen W. Kirkbride K.C. How T. Nelson C.D. Mo J. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Blobe G.C. Science. 2003; 301: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin2 is a member of a family of versatile adapter proteins known to regulate the signaling and internalization of certain activated G-protein-coupled receptors (25.Chen W. Kirkbride K.C. How T. Nelson C.D. Mo J. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Blobe G.C. Science. 2003; 301: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin2 can form specific interactions with members of the endocytic machinery, including clathrin and AP2, resulting in internalization of cell surface receptors, and triggering additional signaling events (26.McDonald P.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin2 contains a consensus mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase recognition sequence within its C-terminal domain, which enables it to function as a scaffold for two MAP kinase cascades, ERK1/2 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, potentially increasing signaling efficiency of activated receptors (26.McDonald P.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 27.Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the association of an activated β2-adrenergic receptor with β-arrestin allows the recruitment of c-Src and endocytic machinery, triggering internalization and downstream activation of the ERK1/2 pathway (26.McDonald P.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and activation of the ERK1/2 pathway by β-arrestins leads to their translocation into the nucleus where they regulate transcription of genes involved in cell survival, growth, differentiation, cell motility, and invasion (26.McDonald P.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). TGF-β is known to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways through mechanisms that are yet to be discerned (5.Siegel P.M. Massague J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Elliott R.L. Blobe G.C. J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 2078-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The two most common methods of endocytosis of cell surface receptors are clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent or lipid raft/caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the most well studied method, is characterized by formation of clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane. Specifically, the formation of clathrin-coated pits is initiated by adaptor protein 2 (AP2) which recruits clathrin and other accessory proteins to the plasma membrane, causing formation of a lattice network. The GTPase dynamin proceeds to “pinch off” the clathrin-coated pit, and the resulting vesicle can recycle its cargo to the plasma membrane, be stripped of clathrin, and enter the early endosomal compartment, resulting in either degradation via the lysosomal pathway or transportation to specific subcellular locations for signaling (29.McPherson P.S. Kay B.K. Hussain N.K. Traffic. 2001; 2: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 30.Neel N.F. Schutyser E. Sai J. Fan G.H. Richmond A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 637-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Lipid raft endocytosis is characterized by plasma membrane domains containing cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and sometimes caveolin-1. Caveolae, a specialized form of the structures that form on the plasma membrane in lipid raft endocytosis, are abundant in many mammalian cells and closely associate with caveolin-1 (31.Kirkham M. Parton R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1745: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This method of endocytosis, whereas not as well studied, is known to be sensitive to cholesterol depletion and has been shown to both cross-talk with and be segregated from common endosomal compartments (32.Le Roy C. Wrana J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of investigating this method of endocytosis, with a growing number of cell surface receptors undergoing lipid raft-mediated endocytosis: interleukin-2 receptor β (33.Lamaze C.

Cell. 2001; 7: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), autocrine motility factor receptor (34.Benlimame N. Le P.U. Nabi I.R. Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar), TβRI, and TβRII (8.Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat.

Although TβRI and TβRII undergo ligand-independent internalization by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, resulting in enhanced signaling, as well as clathrin-independent endocytosis, resulting in receptor degradation, internalization of TβRIII has been largely unexplored (8.Di Guglielmo G.M.

Cell Culture and Reagents—COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). HepG2 cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. L6 stable cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 250 μg/ml G418. Cells were passaged at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cell Surface ELISA—55,000–60,000 COS7 cells × n (number of samples) were plated in a 10-cm dish. At 80% confluence 300 ng/sample of each DNA construct was transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol (2 μl of FuGENE:1 μg of DNA). 24 h post-transfection cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and re-plated into 4-well dishes. 24 h later cells were put on ice and rinsed once with PBS. Samples were then incubated with a TβRIII extracellular specific antibody (αRIII-EC) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 1:250 in DMEM serum-free media for 30 min, rocking at 4 °C. Cells were rinsed once with PBS and replaced with 1 ml of DMEM serum-free media, DMEM + 10% FBS, or DMEM serum-free media + 150 pm TGF-β1. Cells were either kept on ice (0 min samples) or put at 37 °C over the time course of interest. Cells were then returned to ice, rinsed once with PBS, fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 10 min, and rinsed once more with PBS. Cells were rocked at room temperature while incubated with secondary antibody, α-goat-horseradish peroxidase at 1:1000 (in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween) for 15 min, rocking. Cells were then rinsed 2–3 times with PBS and rocked at room temperature for 30 min with 100 μl of a 1-Step Turbo TMB-ELISA substrate (Pierce) immediately followed by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m sulfuric acid. Quantification of cell surface TβRIII expression was accomplished by measuring the Absorbance @450 nm using a Wallac Victor Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) normalized to background. Trypsin Internalization Assay—COS7 cells were plated in 6-cm dishes to reach 60% confluence followed by transfection of 2 μg of DNA per plate of indicated constructs using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h later cells were put on ice and rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS. Then cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in Hepes buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes), rocking at 4 °C for 2 h. Cells on ice were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS. 1 ml of room temperature media (DMEM + 10% FBS or DMEM serum-free media) was added to select samples followed by a time course at 37 °C. Cells were then rinsed once with PBS on ice and incubated at 37 °C with trypsin for ≈1 min followed by immediate addition of DMEM + 10% FBS on ice. Cells were lysed on ice with 1 ml of RIPA plus protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and dithiothreitol), kept on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Pellets were removed, and 60 μl of each sample was added to 30-μl of 2× sample buffer for β-actin. Samples were then added to either 10 μl of α820 or αRIII-EC antibodies with 25 μl of protein A sepharose or protein G sepharose beads, respectively, and immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitations were rinsed 3 times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer plus protease inhibitors (at 14,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C) followed by the addition of 2× sample buffer. All samples were boiled for 10 min and run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Western blots were performed using strep-horseradish peroxidase at 1:10,000 and αβ-actin at 1:500–1:2000 followed by secondary α-mouse at 1:1000 and detected using a Pico West chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Time Constant Calculations—Data were plotted as the percentage of initially labeled receptor remaining on the cell surface over a time course at 37 °C using Microsoft Excel. A single exponential decay function was then fit to the data (time points of 10 min and longer for ELISA and 5 min or longer for trypsin assays) of the form y = 100e-t/τ. The equation was then solved for the time constant τ. Sucrose Density Fractionation—COS7 and HepG2 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes to obtain ∼1 × 108 cells in total when transfection was performed. COS7 cells were infected at 30 plaque-forming units/cell with Adeno-HA-hTβRIII or Adeno-HA-hTβRIIIΔgag. Cells were put on ice, rinsed once with PBS, collected, and centrifuged for 3 min; supernatant was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of homogenization buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl) plus 0.5% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Cells were then passed 10 times through a 25-gauge needle and incubated on ice for 30 min. 1 ml of this cell solution was added to the bottom of centrifuge tubes followed by the addition of 1 ml of an 80% sucrose solution, 6.5 ml of a 30% sucrose solution, and 2.5 ml of a 5% sucrose solution. Samples were centrifuged at 38,000 rpm using a SW-40 swing-bucket rotor for ∼20 h at 4 °C. On ice, 900-μl top-to-bottom fractions were removed. The cell pellet (final fraction) was suspended in 900 μl of homogenization buffer and sonicated. A mix of 300 μl of each fraction was added to 60 μl of 6× sample buffer and run on 8 and 10% SDS-PAGE gels to Western blot for TβRIII, clathrin, caveolin-1, flotillin, and the cholera-toxin B subunit. Down-regulation—Cells were plated in 6-well dishes to obtain 70% confluence on the start of the experiment. Cells were rinsed with 1 ml of warmed binding buffer (0.25 g of bovine serum albumin into 50 ml of KRH) followed by the addition of 2 ml of binding buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were moved to 4 °C, and 150 pm 125I-labeled TGF-β1 was added for 3 h, rocking. Cells were then rinsed 4 times with KRH followed by the addition of 0.05 mg/μl 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid in DMSO solution for 15 min at 4 °C, rocking. 1 m glycine was added for 10 min to quench the 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid/DMSO solution followed by 3 rinses with KRH. Warmed DMEM + 10% FBS was added to cells followed by a time course of interest at 37 °C. Cells were returned to 4 °C, rinsed once with KRH, lysed with hot 2× sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Samples were then run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, dried, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. To examine the lipid raft endocytic pathway, COS7 cells were transfected with TβRIIIΔgag using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h cells were exposed to 250 pm 125I-TGF-β1 binding and cross-linking as described above. After 2.5 h, select cells were pretreated for 30 min with 25, 50, or 100 μg/ml nystatin ± 0.25 mm cholesterol and exposed to the same concentrations of nystatin ± 0.25 mm cholesterol for the first hour of the 5-h time course. Buffers contained 0.025 mg/ml cycloheximide throughout the experiment. Cells were lysed and analyzed as described above. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ. Examination of the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway was done by FuGENE 6 transfection of COS7 cells with 2 μg of TβRIIIΔgag or TβRIII-FL or HepG2 cells with transfection of a control dynamin wild-type construct or mutant dynamin K44A. Binding and cross-linking was performed as described above, with ranges of 25–150 pm 125I-TGF-β1 used followed by a 5- or 22-h time course at 37 °C. Buffers contained 0.025 mg/ml cycloheximide throughout the experiment. Cells were lysed with 2× sample buffer, boiled, separated on a 7.5% SDS-page gel, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen. β-Actin served as a loading control, and densitometry was performed using ImageJ. Confocal Microscopy—Approximately 2 × 105 COS7 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in a 6-well dish. 2 μg of each construct, TβRIII-FL and Rab9 or SARA (smad-anchor for receptor activation), was transfected using FuGENE 6 according to manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS, permeabilized for 5 min at room temperature with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, rinsed twice, blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and again rinsed twice. Samples were then incubated for 1 h in primary antibody diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. TβRIII-FL was detected using an antibody specific to the extracellular domain, αRIII-EC, at 1:250. SARA was detected using a monoclonal α-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) at 1:500. Endogenous clathrin was detected using a monoclonal α-clathrin heavy chain antibody (Sigma) at 1:100. Endogenous caveolin was detected using a monoclonal α-caveolin 1 antibody (BD Biosciences) at 1:100. Endogenous flotillin was detected using α-flotillin-1 antibody (BD Biosciences) at 1:100. Cells were rinsed 3 × 5 min with PBS followed by a 20-min incubation with rabbit α-goat Alexa 594 or rabbit α-mouse Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) secondary antibody at 1:500 or 1:1000 dilutions in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS covered in foil. Cells were rinsed 3 × 5 min with PBS followed by a 10-min incubation with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.03% in PBS). Cells were rinsed three times in PBS followed by a rinse with distilled H2O and mounted onto slides using ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Analysis was done using a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal microscope, and colocalization was determined by % pixel overlap using the LSM Image Browser. Co-immunoprecipitation—COS-7 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h post-transfection cells expressing vector control (pcDNA3.1) or RIII constructs (TβRIII-FL, TβRIIIΔGAG, and TβRIIIΔcyto) were washed with PBS then lysed on ice with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10% w/v glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma protease inhibitor mixture) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma phosphatase inhibitor mixture). The lysates were precleared by centrifugation and incubated with an RIII-EC antibody for 4 h at 4 °C then with protein G-agarose beads for an additional 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, and pellets were washed with lysis buffer and stored in 2× sample buffer before Western blot analyses. Signaling—Untransfected HepG2 or L6 stables were serum-starved overnight or for 1–2 h, respectively. Select samples were either untreated or pretreated for 3 h with 50 μg/ml nystatin ± 0.25 mm cholesterol. All samples underwent a 10-min dose course of TGF-β1 treatment and lysis with 2× sample buffer. Western blot analysis was performed using p-Smad2, total Smad2, p-p38, and total p38 antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Time Course of TβRIII Internalization—Because TβRIII internalization has not been characterized previously, we first investigated the time course of TβRIII internalization utilizing two complementary methods; that is, a cell surface ELISA, which assesses loss of cell surface receptors from an initially labeled pool of cell surface receptors over a time course, and a trypsin-biotinylation internalization assay, which assesses internalized receptors from an initially labeled pool of biotinylated cell surface receptors. Because endogenous TGF-β receptors, including TβRIII, are very difficult to detect and to characterize TβRIII in isolation from other TGF-β superfamily receptors, we initially evaluated TβRIII internalization in overexpression models. Full-length TβRIII (TβRIII-FL) or TβRIIIΔgag (in which both glycosaminoglycan attachment sites are mutated preventing glycosaminoglyan modification of the extracellular domain) were expressed in COS7 cells, which express very low levels of TGF-β superfamily receptors. Receptor internalization was then followed using a cell surface ELISA over a 120-min time course at 37 °C, as preliminary time courses revealed maximum internalization at 120 min, after which cell surface levels stabilized (data not shown). Both TβRIII-FL and TβRIIIΔgag receptors were lost from the cell surface, reaching a maximum internalization of 46 ± 7% for TβRIIIΔgag and 53 ± 1% for TβRIII-FL (Fig. 1A). The data were fit to a single exponential decay function from which an average endocytic time constant, τ, could be determined. TβRIII-FL and TβRIIIΔgag internalized with similar kinetics, with endocytic time constants of τ = 201 ± 28 for TβRIII-FL and τ = 237 ± 36 min for TβRIIIΔgag (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the glycosaminoglycan modifications do not significantly alter TβRIII internalization. In a complementary manner, the trypsin-biotinylation internalization assay demonstrated time-dependent internalization of TβRIII and TβRIIIΔgag, with τ = 200 min (Fig. 1B, data not shown). TβRIII Internalization Is Ligand-independent—Although some signaling pathways, including the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway, require ligand for initiation of receptor internalization and down-regulation, other signaling pathways, including the type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) TGF-β receptors undergo ligand-independent internalization (38.Mitchell H.

We describe a novel mutation (S558Y) in transmembrane helix 2 of Pdr5 identified in a screen for suppressors that eliminated Pdr5-mediated cycloheximide hyper-resistance. Nucleotides as well as transport substrates bind to the mutant Pdr5 with an affinity comparable with that for wild-type Pdr5. Wild-type and mutant Pdr5s show ATPase activity with comparable Km(ATP) values. Nonetheless, drug sensitivity is equivalent in the mutant pdr5 and the pdr5 deletion. Finally, the transport substrate clotrimazole, which is a noncompetitive inhibitor of Pdr5 ATPase activity, has a minimal effect on ATP hydrolysis by the S558Y mutant. These results suggest that the drug sensitivity of the mutant Pdr5 is attributable to the uncoupling of NTPase activity and transport. We screened for amino acid alterations in the nucleotide-binding domains that would reverse the phenotypic effect of the S558Y mutation.

Multidrug transporters, including members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 2The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; cyh, cycloheximide; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; ICL, intracellular loop; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; P-gp, P-glycoprotein; PM, plasma membrane; R6G, rhodamine 6G; TMD, transmembrane domain; TMH, transmembrane helix; WT, wild type; IAAP, iodoarylazidoprazosin; clo, clotrimazole; Vi, vanadate.2The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; cyh, cycloheximide; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; ICL, intracellular loop; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; P-gp, P-glycoprotein; PM, plasma membrane; R6G, rhodamine 6G; TMD, transmembrane domain; TMH, transmembrane helix; WT, wild type; IAAP, iodoarylazidoprazosin; clo, clotrimazole; Vi, vanadate. family, show unusual flexibility toward their substrate cargo. They efflux structurally diverse xenobiotic compounds and confer broad-spectrum hyperresistance when they are overexpressed, a property that impedes chemotherapeutic treatment of pathogens and cancer.Several fungi, including the clinically relevant human pathogenic species Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, contain major multidrug transporters that are close homologues to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transporter Pdr5 (1.Posteraro B. Sanguinetti M. Sanglard D. La Sorda M. Boccia S. Romano L. Morace G. Fadda G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is well established that many clinical isolates of C. albicans overproduce the Pdr5 homologue Cdr1 (2.White T.C. Marr K.A. Bowden R.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 382-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multidrug-resistant fungi are an increasing problem in the treatment of immunocompromised patients with AIDS and cancer (3.Monk B.C. Goffeau A. Science. 2008; 321: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).The Pdr5 subfamily of multidrug transporters shows significant differences in molecular architecture from their mammalian counterparts such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or Mrp1. The nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of these important fungal transporters precede the transmembrane domains (TMDs) and thus their orientation is the reverse of P-gps and Mrp1s. Furthermore, the Walker A, B, and signature motifs are degenerate when compared with nonfungal ABC counterparts. For example, a cysteine replaces a lysine in Walker A (Cys-199) of the N-terminal NBD (NBD1) that is essential in other ABC transporters (1.Posteraro B. Sanguinetti M. Sanglard D. La Sorda M. Boccia S. Romano L. Morace G. Fadda G. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Not surprisingly, the ATPase activities of Pdr5 and C. albicans Cdr1p appear to be similar (4.Decottignies A. Kolaczkowski M. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12797-12803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Golin J. Kon Z.N. Wu C.P. Martello J. Hanson L. Supernavage S. Ambudkar S.V. Sauna Z.E.

Recently, we demonstrated that Pdr5 also hydrolyzes GTP at physiological concentrations and that this activity is considerably more resistant to some substrates, such as clotrimazole (clo), than is its ATPase activity. Furthermore, GTP fuels Pdr5-mediated chloramphenicol efflux in purified vesicles (5.Golin J. Kon Z.N. Wu C.P. Martello J. Hanson L. Supernavage S. Ambudkar S.V. Sauna Z.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13109-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Pdr5 has great flexibility not only in the drug cargo that it transports but also in its efflux energy source.Considerable progress has been made in recent decades in understanding the domain organization of ABC transporters and the mechanism of the transport cycle (8.Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A typical ABC protein consists of four domains, two TMDs and two NBDs. The TMDs contain the drug-binding sites, which show little sequence similarity in different ABC transporters. By contrast, the NBDs exhibit very high sequence similarity.The activity of an ABC transporter hinges on the effective coupling of the ATP catalytic cycle, which occurs at the NBDs, and the drug-transport cycle, which occurs at the TMDs. Mutational analyses, labeling with the photoaffinity drug or nucleotide analogues, and cross-linking with the thiol-reactive substrate derivatives have yielded a wealth of information about interactions at the drug-binding domains as well as about the role of conserved residues in the NBDs. Biochemical and genetic studies suggested the existence of a transmission interface that couples the energy of ATP binding and/or hydrolysis to conformational changes at the TMDs (9.Jones P.M. George A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). These studies have taken indirect approaches, however, such as the determining the effect of drugs on ATP hydrolysis.The recent elucidation of the x-ray structure of Sav1866, a bacterial ABC transporter (10.Dawson R.J.P. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar), has permitted the delineation of such a transmission interface in more precise detail. A novel feature of this structure is that both NBDs contact the TMDs. These contacts occur via intracellular loops (ICLs) that link the transmembrane helices. The organization of the structure of this domain suggests a plausible explanation for the mechanical coupling between the NBDs and TMDs of ABC transporters. In addition, recent studies with P-gp and Yor1 used site-directed mutagenesis and cross-linking agents to demonstrate the proximity of ICL2 and the Q-loop (11.Pagant S. Brovman E.Y. Halliday J.J. Miller E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26444-26451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12.Zolnerciks J.K. Wooding C. Linton K.J. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3937-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These studies show or imply a physical interaction, but none establish that these regions are involved in communication between the TMDs and NBDs. Demonstrating the functional relevance of such interactions remains a challenge.Here we describe the behavior of an S558Y mutation in transmembrane helix 2 (TMH2) that retains significant ATPase activity and drug-binding capability but nevertheless tests as phenotypically null for drug resistance and transport. Furthermore, an allosteric inhibitory signal mediated by the Pdr5-specific transport substrate clotrimazole is greatly diminished. These deficiencies are significantly alleviated by a suppressor mutation that lies near the Q-loop of NBD1. This is a particularly important observation because recent work suggests that the noncanonical NBD1 of Pdr5 may not play a catalytic role in ATP hydrolysis (13.Ernst R. Kueppers P. Klein C.M. Schwarzmueller T. Kuchler K. Schmitt L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5069-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Our results are thus consistent with the x-ray crystallographic structure of Sav1866 and suggest that even evolutionarily distant ABC transporters have a similar coupling interface. Moreover, our strategy of using suppressor mutations to identify the interacting residues in the TMDs and NBDs has obvious advantages over the use of site-directed mutagenesis. This powerful approach can also be applied to any mammalian transporter that is expressed in yeast and has a readily observable phenotype.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Genetic Transformation—The strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. All are isogenic to each other and derived from AD1–7, which lacks all PM ABC transporters but contains a PDR1–3 allele that results in overexpression of PDR5 when a plasmid containing this gene is integrated into its chromosomal location. The construction of JG2000 and JG2001 was described previously (5.Golin J. Kon Z.N. Wu C.P. Martello J. Hanson L. Supernavage S. Ambudkar S.V. Sauna Z.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13109-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this study All the strains are isogenic derivatives of AD1–7, with the exception of JG365-3B.StrainRelevant genotypeSource or Ref.JG365-3BMat a PDR5 PDR1-3 ura3 leu235.Meyers S.

The first series of strains carry two copies of PDR5 either as wild type (WT; JG2004) or mutant (JG2010). These strains produce significantly more Pdr5 than does the popular single-copy strain AD124567 and are thus invaluable for biochemical studies. JG2004 was created by transforming JG2001 with pSS607, the plasmid containing the WT gene PDR5.The JG2009 strain contains a single copy of the S558Y allele and was used to create JG2010. A PDR5-bearing strain (JG2001) was transformed with S558Y to create JG2003. Treatment with 5-fluoorotic acid (5-FOA) (14.Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) yielded Ura- segregants (9/22) that were multidrug-sensitive and thus contained S558Y. We retained one of these and designated it JG2009. Transformation of this strain with an S558Y plasmid resulted in JG2010, which contains a tandem duplication of the mutant allele and is the mutant equivalent of JG2004.We designed another strain, R-1, to obviate a basic problem found in AD1–7. This strain carries only a partial deletion of PDR5 (from -187 to 1437 (15.Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moylerowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)). When we introduce into AD1–7 a pdr5 mutation located in the coding sequence beyond approximately the first 445 residues, a WT gene is sometimes reconstituted by homologous recombination. By contrast, the entire coding region of PDR5 is replaced in R-1 by a KANMX4 (geneticin-resistant) cassette that we PCR-amplified from BY2909 as described previously (16.Rutledge R.M. Ghislain M. Mullins J.M. de Thozee C.P. Golin J. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2008; 279: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This strain is otherwise phenotypically indistinguishable from AD1–7.All of these new isogenic strains are available from the corresponding author. We used a Gietz transformation kit (Medicorp, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) to introduce plasmids and PCR-generated products into yeast.Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—We created all site-directed mutants from the plasmid pSS607, which was described previously (5.Golin J. Kon Z.N. Wu C.P. Martello J. Hanson L. Supernavage S. Ambudkar S.V. Sauna Z.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13109-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To obtain pS558Y, pS558A, and pN242K, we carried out PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis with the Quick Change kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR primers carrying the desired base pair substitution were prepared, and PAGE was purified by Operon Biotechnologies (Huntsville, AL). The resulting mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing the entire PDR5 insert. Sequencing was performed by Retrogen (San Diego, CA). We constructed the 14 sequencing primers so that the resulting sequencing data would contain substantial overlapping segments, thus ensuring accuracy.Chemicals and Media—All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. We dissolved cycloheximide (cyh) in sterile water and all other compounds in dimethyl sulfoxide. We purchased 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (15–20 Ci/mmol) from Affinity Labeling Technologies, Inc. (Lexington, KY). We obtained [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin ([125I]IAAP), 2,200 Ci/mmol, from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.We cultured cells in yeast extract, peptone, glucose (YPD) medium. Cyh, tritylimidazole, and clo were added to YPD after autoclaving. Tetrabutyltin was added to yeast extract, peptone, glycerol (YPG) medium. After sterilization, 5-FOA (1 g/liter) was added to synthetic dextrose complete medium.Determining IC50 Values in Liquid Culture—We grew cultures of yeast strains to be tested for drug hypersensitivity overnight in 5 ml of YPD broth in 15-ml clinical centrifuge tubes at 30 °C in a shaking water bath. Then cells were pelleted in a clinical centrifuge at high speed for 5 min. We decanted the growth medium and washed the pellets with 10 ml of sterile water before resuspension. We determined cellular concentration by spectroscopy (absorbance at 600 nm). We removed 0.5 × 105 cells, added this to 2 ml of YPD broth containing cyh (0.18–43.2 μm) or tritylimidazole (2–20 μm), and incubated the cultures at 30 °C with shaking. After 48 h, we monitored relative inhibition by determining the absorbance at 600 nm and comparing measurements to cells grown in YPD alone.Qualitative Analysis of Relative Drug Resistance—We tested mutant and control strains qualitatively for drug resistance by spotting 2-fold dilutions of cells in 5 μl of water on plates with a fixed concentration of a xenobiotic compound. Cultures to be tested were grown overnight in 10 ml of YPD broth. The cultures were washed and concentrated by centrifugation and resuspended in sterile water at 1/10th the original culture volume. We diluted a small sample 100-fold and determined the absorbance at 600 nm to check cell concentration. We made 2-fold dilutions in sterile water before plating in a 5-μl sample.UV Mutagenesis of JG365-3B—The first S558Y allele was created by UV mutagenesis as described previously (17.de Thozee C.P. Cronin S. Goj A. Golin J. Ghislain M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 811-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Estimating the Frequency of Reversion—To estimate the rate of reversion of S558Y, 10 1-ml YPD cultures were seeded with 100 cells and grown to saturation. We plated 106 cells in 4-ml sterile agar on plates containing 7.5 μm clotrimazole and incubated them for 5 days at 30 °C. We counted the suppressors and picked them for further testing.Preparation of Purified Membrane Vesicles—We prepared plasma membrane (PM) vesicles as described previously (18.Shukla S. Saini P. Smriti, Jha S. Ambudkar S.V. Prasad R. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 1361-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), with further modification (5.Golin J. Kon Z.N. Wu C.P. Martello J. Hanson L. Supernavage S. Ambudkar S.V. Sauna Z.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13109-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We determined protein concentration in the vesicles with a bicinchonic acid kit (Perbio, Rockland, IL).Immunoblots of Pdr5 in PM Vesicles—Proteins in the purified PM vesicles were separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at constant current (400 mA, 1 h). The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 30 min with 20% nonfat milk in PBS containing Triton X-100 (PBST); incubated with a 1:200 dilution of polyclonal goat, anti-Pdr5 antibody, and yC-18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); washed with PBST (three times for 15 min); incubated with a 1:5,000 dilution of secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase in 5% nonfat milk) for 2 h; and washed with PBST (three times for 15 min). The chemiluminescence signal was developed by adding 10 ml of ECL reagent for 10 min and then exposing to x-ray film for 0.5–1 min.Assay of ATPase Activity—ATPase activity of purified PM vesicles was measured by the end point Pi assay as described previously for P-gp (19.Ambudkar S.V. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 292: 504-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 20.Ambudkar S.V. Lelong I.H. Zhang J. Cardarelli C.O. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8472-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), with minor modifications for Pdr5 (5.Golin J. Kon Z.N. Wu C.P. Martello J. Hanson L. Supernavage S. Ambudkar S.V. Sauna Z.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13109-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).One concern about ATPase measurements made with PM preparations is that these contain Pma1p [H+], which exhibits vanadate (Vi)-sensitive ATPase activity. We described our resolution of this issue in detail in a previous study (5.Golin J. Kon Z.N. Wu C.P. Martello J. Hanson L. Supernavage S. Ambudkar S.V. Sauna Z.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13109-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, the optimal pH for Pma1p [H+]is ∼5.5–6.0, and the enzyme is only minimally active at pH 7.5. We therefore characterized ATPase activity in PMs from the Pdr5 at pH 7.5. In addition, measurements were made with purified PM vesicles from both Pdr5+ strains and the Δpdr5 strains, and the small amount of residual ATPase activity (<5%) observed in Δpdr5 strains was subtracted.Rhodamine 6G (R6G) Transport Assay—We measured R6G transport at 30 °C as described previously (21.Hanson L. May L. Tuma P. Keeven J. Mehl P. Ferenz M. Ambudkar S.V. Golin J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9703-9713Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The concentration of R6G used in this study was 2.5 μm.Cross-linking of 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP to Pdr5—We carried out binding studies in purified PM vesicles at 4 °C. Membrane proteins (18 μg/assay) were suspended in MOPS ATPase assay buffer containing 10 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (2.5 μCi/nmol). Samples were incubated in the dark for 5 min at 4 °C before cross-linking with 365 nm UV light on ice for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 12.5 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE sample-loading buffer. After electrophoresis on a Tris acetate gel at constant voltage, gels were dried. We quantified the radioactivity incorporated into the Pdr5 band with a STORM 860 Phosphor-Imager system (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant software.Cross-linking of [125I]IAAP to Pdr5—Purified membranes prepared from yeast cells overexpressing Pdr5 were incubated at room temperature in the ATPase buffer with [125I]IAAP (7 nm) for 5 min under subdued light. The samples were photocross-linked for 10 min with 365 nm UV light at room temperature followed by electrophoresis with 7% NuPAGE gels and quantified as described previously (21.Hanson L. May L. Tuma P. Keeven J. Mehl P. Ferenz M. Ambudkar S.V. Golin J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9703-9713Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Modifications to this procedure in specific experiments are described in the figure legends.DNA Extraction and PCR Recovery of Suppressor Mutant Sequences—We amplified PDR5 from suppressor mutants with a PureLink Genomic DNA kit from Invitrogen. The DNA was extracted as described in the accompanying handbook from Invitrogen, with several modifications. We lysed 4 × 107 cells for each extraction. We purchased zymolyase made up in buffer from Sigma. We used 1 ml (∼60 units of activity) for each sample. We also doubled the volume of proteinase K and RNase A.We carried out PCR amplification with Platinum PCR Supermix High Fidelity from Invitrogen, with the following protocol: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 7 min. Reactions were then placed on hold at 4 °C until they were processed further. The primers used to amplify PDR5 were left, TAAGACTCCGGTGAGTGTGG (Tm of 59 °C), and right, GCACGTTCGTTGTACTTCCA (Tm of 60 °C).RESULTSS558Y Mutation—The S558Y allele was identified in the course of a large mutant search designed to uncover suppressors that eliminated the cyh resistance of a strain overproducing Pdr5 (JG365-3B), the major yeast multidrug transporter. Following UV mutagenesis, we screened ∼70,000 survivors and isolated 17 cyh-sensitive colonies that failed to complement a known pdr5 deletion. Of these, 16 were severely impaired and phenotypically similar to the deletion; a single very leaky allele was also recovered.Immunoblotting of purified PM vesicles indicated that in 15 of these 17 mutants, Pdr5 was significantly reduced or missing (data not shown). One such mutant, pdr5-107 was the subject of recent study (17.de Thozee C.P. Cronin S. Goj A. Golin J. Ghislain M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 811-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Another mutant, although severely drug-sensitive, had unaltered levels of Pdr5 in its PM. Complete nucleotide sequencing of the PDR5 gene indicated that it contained an S558Y missense mutation. The reported TMHs of Pdr5 suggested that this residue lie just outside TMH2. The original TMH assignments, however, were slightly different from those that we have established from seven topology modeling programs that allow us to predict core consensus sequences. Results from all these programs place Ser-558 in TMH2. 3R. Rutledge and D. Xia, manuscript in preparation.Drug Phenotypes of S558Y and S558A—The S558Y mutation was recreated in pSS607, a yeast integrative vector that we recently described (5.Golin J. Kon Z.N. Wu C.P.

The mutant plasmids were completely sequenced to verify that each had only the desired alteration. From these plasmids we created several strains used in this study; all are isogenic to each other. Fig. 1A shows the relative clo sensitivity of four strains as follows: R-1 (pdr5::KANMX4); R-1 + pSS607, referred to as WT; R-1 + pS558Y or S558Y; and R-1 + pS558A or S558A.These data indicate that the S558Y mutation is drug hypersensitive as we predicted. By contrast, the S558A allele is phenotypically similar to the WT PDR5. This result suggests that it is the size of the tyrosine residue rather than the hydrophobicity of its aromatic ring that is primarily responsible for the observed mutant phenotype. A similar phenotype is observed with tritylimidazole and tetrabutyltin. These substrates were used to define different transport sites in Pdr5 that may or may not overlap (22.Golin J. Ambudkar S.V.

In each case, S558Y is considerably more sensitive than the WT control to all of these xenobiotic agents and is qualitatively the same as the Δpdr5::KANMX4 isogenic negative control.Several studies have indicated that the drug-binding sites of ABC transporters consist of a large pocket, and individual transport substrates show specific interactions with different amino acid side chains (24.Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1210-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The fact that the S558Y mutant is not substrate-specific (Fig. 1A) suggests that the reversal of drug resistance is a consequence of general steric hindrance and that the Ser-588 residue may not be involved in specific interactions with the drugs. This is consistent with the finding that the mutation S558A does not affect Pdr5 function.We carried out a quantitative analysis of relative cyh resistance in liquid culture. The data in Fig. 1B show that the S558Y mutant has an IC50 value that is ∼30-fold lower (0.5 μm) than the WT and is similar to the Δpdr5 control.Fig. 1C illustrates the behavior of double- and single-copy strains at low cyh concentrations. Strains containing 1 (JG2009) or 2 copies of S558Y show similar drug hypersensitivity. Therefore, doubling the amount of mutant protein does not increase cyh resistance. This is significant because the increased levels of Pdr5 in the double-copy strains are useful in biochemical assays, where they provide more robust measurements.S558Y Mutant Strain Is Transport-deficient—We analyzed the transport capability of S558Y with a well established, wholecell R6G efflux assay that uses flow cytometry (21.Hanson L.

These data clearly demonstrate that the S558Y mutation creates an R6G transport deficiency that is as severe as that observed in the Δpdr5 strain.

https://openalex.org/W2155465939,"Theoretical models of sexual selection predict that both males and females of many species should benefit by selecting their mating partners. However, empirical evidence testing and validating this prediction is scarce. In particular, whereas inbreeding avoidance is expected to induce sexual conflicts, in some cases both partners could benefit by acting in concert and exerting mutual mate choice for non-assortative pairings. We tested this prediction with the gregarious cockroach Blattella germanica (L.). We demonstrated that males and females base their mate choice on different criteria and that choice occurs at different steps during the mating sequence. Males assess their relatedness to females through antennal contacts before deciding to court preferentially non-siblings. Conversely, females biased their choice towards the most vigorously courting males that happened to be non-siblings. This study is the first to demonstrate mutual mate choice leading to close inbreeding avoidance. The fact that outbred pairs were more fertile than inbred pairs strongly supports the adaptive value of this mating system, which includes no ""best phenotype"" as the quality of two mating partners is primarily linked to their relatedness. We discuss the implications of our results in the light of inbreeding conflict models."

Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and advanced envelope restoration methods revealed the shape of full-length and catalytically active hA3G in solution (35Wedekind J.E. Gillilan R. Janda A.

The resulting molecular envelope suggested that the native conformation of hA3G is minimally a dimer with subunit contacts through the C termini. The protein has an elongated morphology and substantially exposed surface area along the contour length of the dimer. This structural model predicted a limited contact between hA3G subunits but did not have resolution sufficient to identify the residues involved in dimerization. In support of these predictions, the crystal structure of human APOBEC2 also had an elongated shape comprised of dimers with subunit contacts through the N termini and C-terminal contacts between dimers, reminiscent of a dimer of dimers (36Prochnow C. Bransteitter R. Klein M.G. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2007; 445: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In contrast to these structural models, an NMR study demonstrated that a fragment of hA3G containing the C-terminal catalytic domain was a monomer and retained deaminase activity in an Escherichia coli reporter system (37Chen K.M. Harjes E. Gross P.J. Fahmy A. Lu Y. Shindo K. Harris R.S. Matsuo H. Nature. 2008; 452: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These findings bring into question the biological relevance of multimeric versus monomeric structural models for hA3G. In the current study, we demonstrate through in vitro and in-cell studies that hA3G forms multimers through protein-protein contacts within the ZDD domain of the C terminus. Consistent with our previous SAXS model, domains within the N terminus of hA3G did not form protein-protein multimers (35Wedekind J.E. Gillilan R. Janda A. Krucinska J. Salter J.D. Bennett R.P. Raina J. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38122-38126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The proposed elongated conformation of hA3G was further supported by the finding that domains retained their unique attributes of known functions and interactions when expressed as individual monomeric domains. Plasmid Construction—Full-length hA3G and domains ΔCD1, C1/2, N1/2, CD1, CD2, NCD1, and NCD2 were cloned into the pIRES-P (38Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) mammalian expression vector with EGFP-HA, EGFP-V5, REACh2-HA, HA, or V5 tags in the N or C terminus. HIV-1 expression construct pDHIV3-GFP is a pNL4-3-derived vector that contains a deletion of the env gene and in which the nef gene is replaced with EGFP. The Δvif HIV-1 expression construct pDHIV3-GFP/Δvif contains a 12-bp insert containing two termination codons that reside near residue 89 of Vif, thereby leading to the production of a truncated and non-functional vif gene product (both HIV constructs were gifts from Prof. Baek Kim, Dept. of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Rochester). The vif gene was also PCR-amplified from pDHIV3-GFP and inserted into the pIRES-P vector containing an N-terminal EGFP-HA tag. Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—Various combinations of alternatively tagged hA3G domains, HIV-1 expression constructs, and EGFP-HA-Vif were transfected into 293T cells with FuGENE® 6 (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell extracts were harvested in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with Complete® Mini EDTA free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cell extracts were treated with 0, 40, or 400 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently precleared with protein A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) tumbling for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared extracts were split and added to a protein A bead slurry ± V5 (Invitrogen) or GFP (Clontech) antibodies for immunoprecipitation by tumbling overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and eluted three times with 1× Treat (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% SDS). Elutions were acetone-precipitated and resuspended in SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer and separated by 10.5% SDS-PAGE. The protein was transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) and Western blotted with V5 (Invitrogen), HA (Covance), GFP (Clontech), or p24 (antibody number 3537, National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) (39Chesebro B. Wehrly K. Nishio J. Perryman S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6547-6554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) antibodies. Trueblot™ ULTRA anti-mouse secondary antibody (eBioscience), which does not bind to unfolded antibody, was used to prevent immunoglobulin heavy chain from being detected on Western blots. RNA UV Cross-linking—To evaluate hA3G non-selective RNA binding activity, a 448-nucleotide transcript of apoB RNA was in vitro transcribed with 32P-radiolabeled ATP and CTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T7 polymerase (Promega). The radiolabeled RNA was gel-isolated and added to 500 μl of cell extracts made from 293T cells expressing V5-tagged hA3G or EGFP-V5-CD2 for 30 min at 30 °C. The RNA was UV cross-linked to the proteins in the cell extract using short wave UV light in quartz cuvettes at 4 °C for 7 min as described previously (40Smith H.C. Methods (San Diego). 1998; 15: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Immediately after UV cross-linking, cell extracts were treated with 5 μg/ml each of RNases T1 and A for 1 h at 37 °C followed by preclearing and immunoprecipitation as described above. The nitrocellulose transferred protein was exposed to Biomax XAR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) to identify radiolabeled bands from nucleotides covalently cross-linked to hA3G or CD2. The nitrocellulose was subsequently Western blotted with V5 antibody (Invitrogen) to overlay with the radiolabeled band. In Vivo FqRET—EGFP served as donor whose fluorescence signal was quenched by the resonance energy-accepting chromoprotein 2 (REACh2). In this fluorescence-quenched resonance energy transfer (FqRET) assay, REACh2 (a variant of yellow fluorescent protein) absorbs light at the emission wavelength of EGFP but has no fluorescence emission itself (41Ganesan S. Ameer-Beg S.M. Ng T.T. Vojnovic B. Wouters F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4089-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). EGFP-V5-tagged N1/2, C1/2, and CD2 were co-transfected with REACh2-HA-tagged N1/2, C1/2, and CD2 or empty vector at a 1:8 μg ratio of cDNA for EGFP to REACh2 into 293T cells. In co-transfected cells, the EGFP chimera fluorescence signal will be quenched only if the REACh2 chimera is within close proximity (i.e. due to the interaction between hA3G domains). Twenty-four hours after transfection, a 10 μm final concentration of Hoechst 33342 (Anaspec Inc., San Jose, CA) was added to the cell culture media, and cells were imaged at 500-ms exposures by a QICIM-IR fast 12 bit monochrome camera viewed by Q capture software (Q-Imaging) through a ×20 Olympus objective with an Olympus IX 70 inverted fluorescence microscope and label-specific chrome filters. The gray value for each cell in three separate fields was determined with the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). A linear regression model was used to specify the relationship between the measure of fluorescence intensity (gray value) for the EGFP-tagged domains in the presence and absence of REACh2-tagged domains. χ2 tests were performed to evaluate each domain comparison of interest at α = 0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) on a Windows XP platform. Rationale Guiding the Selection of hA3G Domains—SAXS analysis revealed the nm-resolution structure of catalytically active hA3G in solution. The size and mass suggested a dimer comprising four discrete, relatively large volumes arranged in an elongated and linear manner (Fig. 1B) (35Wedekind J.E. Gillilan R. Janda A. Krucinska J. Salter J.D. Bennett R.P. Raina J. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38122-38126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Each large volume of the molecular envelope accommodates the approximate volume of a representative ZDD domain (Fig. 1, B and C). Based on this distribution of ZDD domains within the SAXS envelope as well as the location of each ZDD motif in a single polypeptide (Fig. 1A), it was posited that hA3G subunits dimerize via the C-terminal domain (1MacElrevey C.

Gel filtration of RNase-digested, recombinant full-length hA3G purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells also supported a dimeric mass with an elution time corresponding to 95 kDa (35Wedekind J.E.

Such a mass was consistent with a dimeric peak in other chromatography studies (21Chiu Y.L. Soros V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C.

However, the SAXS model does not have the resolution to determine exactly where within the C-terminal half-multimerization occurs, thus prompting a more comprehensive analysis in this study. Alternatively tagged (HA and V5) forms of hA3G and domain combinations were expressed in 293T cells to probe for the existence of specific protein-protein interactions. With an initial emphasis on regions composed of a minimal ZDD fold found in all APOBEC related proteins (1MacElrevey C. Wedekind J.E. Smith H.C. RNA and DNA Editing: Molecular Mechanisms and Their Integration into Biological Systems. Wiley, New York2008: 369-419Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar), catalytic domain 1 (CD1, residues 1–143) and catalytic domain 2 (CD2, residues 209–336) were expressed. Subdomains adjacent to CD1 and CD2 were also expressed; these regions were called non-catalytic domain 1 (NCD1, 144–208) and non-catalytic domain 2 (NCD2, 337–384) (Fig. 1, A and B). Constructs containing two or more predicted domains were expressed that incorporated CD1-NCD1 (N1/2, 1–208), CD2-NCD2 (C1/2, 209–384), and a C-terminal domain lacking only CD1 (ΔCD1, 144–384). Multimerization Occurs via the C-terminal Half of hA3G—Cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). Extracts were treated with 40 μg/ml RNase A prior to co-IP to assuage interactions due to RNA bridging. All constructs were well expressed (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 4), and each was recovered by IP utilizing the V5 tag (Fig. 2, lane 2). IPs performed with protein A beads alone indicated that none of the proteins associated non-specifically with protein A (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 6). Co-IP analysis of N-terminal tagged hA3G and its half-domains revealed that full-length hA3G and the C1/2 domain were co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2, A and B), but there was no interaction in the N1/2 domain (Fig. 2C), consistent with predictions from the SAXS molecular envelope (Fig. 1). The lack of N-terminal interactions was confirmed using C-terminal HA- and V5-tagged constructs and co-IP analysis (Fig. 2D). Although the N1/2 domain was incapable of homoligomerization, it was fully competent for its established interactions with Gag and Vif. N1/2 domain, including CD1-NCD1, was required for viral encapsidation and Gag binding (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), whereas the CD1 domain alone was capable of interaction with Vif (supplemental Fig. S1C). These data were consistent with the literature (5Mehle A. Wilson H. Zhang C. Brazier A.J. McPike M. Pery E. Gabuzda D. J.

CD2 Is Necessary and Sufficient for hA3G Multimerization— The interaction of domains was further evaluated using smaller domains tagged with EGFP-V5 and EGFP-HA to increase their mass and thereby facilitate their analysis by SDS-PAGE. EGFP-V5-hA3G did not co-IP EGFP and therefore did not influence the analyses (Fig. 3A). Co-IP analysis of hA3G domains revealed that ΔCD1, C1/2, and CD2 co-immunoprecipitated their alternatively tagged versions (Fig. 3, B–D), but NCD2 did not interact with itself (Fig. 3E). Combinations of N1/2 with C1/2, CD1 with CD2, and NCD1 with NCD2 were also unable to co-IP (supplemental Fig. S2). The data suggested that CD2 was necessary and sufficient for hA3G multimerization. To strengthen our assertion that CD2 interacted via a protein-protein interaction and not an RNA bridge protected from RNase digestion, we analyzed the HA epitope to V5 epitope signal ratio by blotting EGFP-HA-CD2 co-immunoprecipitated by EGFP-V5-CD2 from cell extracts treated with 0, 40, and 400 μg/ml of RNase A. The V5:HA signal ratio was 1.5, 2.1, and 1.3 for the treatments, respectively (Fig. 4A), consistent with hA3G dimerization independent of an RNA bridge. Although the signal varied among treatments, the recovery of the HA epitope with the V5 pull-down remained strong, indicating that most of the interaction between CD2 domains depended on protein-protein contacts. In agreement with this proposal, EGFP-V5-CD2 did not UV cross-link to radiolabeled RNA (Fig. 4B). In contrast, full-length V5-hA3G did UV cross-link (Fig. 4B). This was consistent with the ability of full-length hA3G to bind RNA in the literature (25Svarovskaia E.S. Xu H. Mbisa J.L. Barr R. Gorelick R.J. Ono A. Freed E.O. Hu W.S. Pathak V.K. J. Biol.

Here' we use an in vitro system, in which human T cells migrate across a bronchial epithelial monolayer, to investigate the molecules involved. We show that although inhibition of T-cell LFA-1 blocks egression by 75 ± 5.6% (P<0.0001), inhibition of the LFA-1-ligand ICAM-1 on the epithelium only inhibits by 52.7 ± 0.06% (P=0.0001). We, therefore, looked for other epithelial ligands for LFA-1 and demonstrate that ICAM-2, but not ICAM-3, is expressed on the bronchial epithelium. Blocking ICAM-2 inhibits egression by 50.95 ± 10.79% (P=0.04), and blocking both ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 inhibits egression by 69.6 ± 5.2% (P< 0.0001). Inhibition of LFA-1/ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 interactions on the basolateral epithelium does not prevent egressing T cells from adhering, polarizing, or moving over the basal epithelium, but it does prevent their recognition of the interepithelial junctions. In conclusion, we show that egression of T cells involves three distinct sequential steps: adhesion, junctional recognition, and diapedesis; we further demonstrate that ICAM-2 is expressed on the bronchial epithelium and, together with ICAM-1, has an essential function in the clearance of T cells from the lung.—Porter, J.

Subjecting cultured cortical neurons to prolonged elevations in electrical activity induced tolerance to OGD. Specifically, exposing cultures to a K+-channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine (20–2500 μm), and a GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline (50 μm) (4-AP/bic), for 1–2 days resulted in potent tolerance to normally lethal OGD applied up to 3 days later. Preconditioning induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CREB which, along with Ca2+ spiking and OGD tolerance, was eliminated by tetrodotoxin. Antagonists of NMDA receptors or l-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (L-VGCCs) applied during preconditioning decreased Ca2+ spiking, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CREB, and OGD tolerance more effectively when combined, particularly at the lowest 4-AP concentration. Inhibiting ERK1/2 or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) also reduced Ca2+ spiking and OGD tolerance.

Moreover, transient non-lethal exposure to high dose glutamate or NMDA is sufficient on its own to also induce potent cross-tolerance to ischemia (13.Miao B. Yin X.H. Pei D.S. Zhang Q.G. Zhang G.Y.

To date, preconditioning achieved either by transient ischemia OGD or NMDA can require bringing neurons to the “brink of death” (1.Kirino T. J. Cereb.

Schaller B. Cerebral Ischemic Tolerance. Nova Science Publishers, Inc., Hauppauge2004: 45-94Google Scholar). Induction of a state resistant to ischemia or OGD by brink of death preconditioning may be a “byproduct” of neurons responding to the intense stressor, a state that persists only until normal baseline homeostasis is restored. Can NMDA receptors be engaged in preconditioning neurons against ischemia without approaching the threshold required for death? Synaptic plasticity describes a process whereby the strength of synapses, as well as the efficiency of communication between synapses, is modified by normal (as well as pathological) activity. Neuronal fate can differ depending on the location of NMDA receptors on neurons, with survival or demise linked with synaptic or extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation, respectively. Perhaps synaptic NMDA receptor activation associated with synaptic plasticity may circumvent the brink of death requirement of preconditioning, a constraint that may be more associated with activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (14.Tauskela J.S. Comas T. Hewitt K. Monette R. Paris J. Hogan M. Morley P. Neuroscience. 2001; 107: 571-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we investigate if increasing synaptic input is sufficient to induce tolerance to OGD in neurons. Elevations in electrical activity, achieved by exposing neurons to a GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, sometimes combined with a K+ channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP/bic treatment), or by treatment with low concentrations of NMDA, induce tolerance in neuronal culture to apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or by exposure to chemical agents, or to excitotoxicity induced in apoptotic and non-apoptotic manners, or oxidative stress (16.Hardingham G.E.

Activation of synaptic NMDA receptor-mediated activation and phosphorylation of CREB (pCREB) is implicated in neuroprotection elicited by electrical activity. Likewise, activation of synaptic NMDA receptors induces prolonged phosphorylation and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK1/2, which are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, (23.Sutton G. Chandler L.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 24.Ivanov A. Pellegrino C. Rama S. Dumalska I. Salyha Y. Ben Ari Y. Medina I. J.

In contrast, extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation can induce an ERK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation “shut-off” pathway. We considered if 4-AP/bic treatment of cultured cortical neurons induced a synaptic NMDA receptor-mediated signaling pathway, which culminated in tolerance to OGD, thereby accomplishing preconditioning in a manner more aligned with neuronal signaling associated with synaptic plasticity, rather than with a brink of death stress.

H89 was bought from Axxora (San Diego, CA). 4-AP, 5,7-dichlorothiokynurenic acid, 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX), (5S,10R)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801), KN-62, and KN-93 were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). Bicuculline, 8-cyclopenthyltheophylline, glybenclamide, memantine, nifedipine, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), propidium iodide (PI), tetrodotoxin (TTX), U0126, KT 5720, tolbutamide, PKA inhibitory fragment 14–22 (myristoylated), staurosporine, a protease mixture inhibitor, and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The serum-free protein block and Antibody Diluting Buffer were purchased from DakoCytomation (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Preparation of Cultures—Cultures of E18 rat cortical neurons were prepared as described previously, with experiments performed on cultures grown 14–18 days in vitro (26.Tauskela J.S. Brunette E. O'Reilly N. Mealing G. Comas T. Gendron T.F. Monette R. Morley P. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1734-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Experimental Treatment of Cultures—For preconditioning experiments, each 12-well plate was subjected to 4 conditions in culture medium: 4-AP/bic (preconditioned), control wash, 4-AP/bic plus antagonist/inhibitor, or antagonist/inhibitor alone, followed by washing and replacement with stored culture medium. OGD was performed as previously described (26.Tauskela J.S. Brunette E. O'Reilly N. Mealing G. Comas T. Gendron T.F. Monette R. Morley P. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1734-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) by placing 12-well plates containing cortical cultures exposed to a basic salt solution (which had the following composition (n mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 20 HEPES, 0.03 glycine, pH 7.4) in a 37 °C incubator housed in an anaerobic glovebox (Forma Scientific, Marjetta, OH). Assessment of Neuronal Injury—Neuronal injury was assessed 24 h following treatments as described previously using PI, with fluorescence quantitated using a Cytofluor 2350 fluorescence platereader (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) (26.Tauskela J.S. Brunette E. O'Reilly N. Mealing G. Comas T. Gendron T.F. Monette R. Morley P. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1734-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were exposed to basic salt solution containing 3 mm glucose with 33 μg/ml PI for 30 min at 22 °C, followed by measurement of fluorescence intensities from four locations within each well (Ex = 520 ± 20 nm; Em = 645 ± 20 nm). For normalization purposes, PI was added to sister cultures that were untreated (0% PI-uptake) or exposed to 100 μm NMDA for 15 min to kill all neurons (100% PI-uptake). Intracellular Ca2+ Spiking—To monitor intracellular Ca2+ spiking, fluorescence images were acquired every 2 s for 120 s from cultures previously loaded with 4.5 μm Fluo-4-AM (26.Tauskela J.S. Brunette E. O'Reilly N. Mealing G. Comas T. Gendron T.F. Monette R. Morley P. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1734-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Excitation was delivered through a Lambda DG-5 shutter instrument (Sutter Instrument Co, Novato, CA) housing a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Ex 480 ± 15 nm; Em 535 ± 20 nm) equipped with a Fluar 40×/1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion objective, with images captured using a low light-sensitive Retiga Exi camera (QImaging, Burnaby, BC, Canada). Due to variability between coverslips in 4-AP/bic-induced Ca2+-spiking profiles, each coverslip served as its own internal control. A minimum of two sets of 120-s runs was acquired for 4-AP/bic alone, and then for 4-AP/bic with a drug, with a different region of interest chosen for each spike train. For each drug evaluated, images were acquired from a minimum of two coverslips from a minimum of two different platings. Plots of Ca2+ spike trains represent average intensities calculated from 12–15 neuronal soma. Immunoblotting—The effect of preconditioning on levels of CREB (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated), ERK1/2 (phosphorylated), or actin was determined by immunoblotting. Cultures were washed with basic salt solution and exposed to radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease mixture inhibitor), manually homogenized over ice, vortexed briefly and stored at –80 °C. Upon re-thawing, samples were vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of supernatants was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Protein homogenates were loaded (15 μg) onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk-TBST (200 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Tween-20 (v/v), pH 7.60) for 1 h at room temperature, and then for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoblotting was performed by overnight incubation (4 °C) with either anti-phospho-Ser133 CREB (1:2000 in 5% milk-TBST, rabbit polyclonal, Upstate (Millipore), Lake Placid, NY) or anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1:1000 in 5% milk-TBST, mouse monoclonal (E10), Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Membranes were washed 3 × for 5 min each and placed into the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse/rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000 for anti-pCREB or CREB and 1:2000 for anti-pERK1/2 in 5% milk-TBST, goat anti-rabbit, Amersham Biosciences). After each phosphor-antibody was examined, membranes were subjected to a stripping buffer (62 mm Tris, 69 mm SDS, 0.8% β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 55 °C with constant agitation before being reprobed with anti-CREB (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-actin (1:5000, rabbit polyclonal, Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were treated with an ECL solution (Amersham Biosciences, Baie d'Urfè, PQ, Canada) and exposed to imaging film (Kodak). Images acquired within the linear range of exposures were quantified by densitometric analyses of background-subtracted bands using Northern Eclipse software (Empix Imaging Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Immunoblots are representative of three to five experiments from a minimum of three different platings, with each experiment comprised of two to three wells/condition. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was performed on cultures to detect cellular pCREB immunoreactivity. Cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, exposed to 0.25% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and, to block nonspecific staining, cultures were exposed to serum-free protein block (DakoCytomation) for 1 h at room temperature. Cultures were then treated with anti-phospho-Ser133 CREB (1:300 in Antibody Diluting Buffer) and anti-MAP2 (1:300 in Antibody Diluting Buffer, mouse monoclonal, Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by treatment with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature protected from light. Omitting the primary antibody exposure served as a negative control. Coverslips were mounted on slides using Vectashield Hard Set Mounting Medium for Fluorescence (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence imaging was performed using an LSM-410 Zeiss inverted laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). MEA Acquisition and Analysis—Prior to initial use, a multielectrode dish (MEA, Alpha MED Sciences, Tokyo, Japan) was washed with deionized water, sterilized with 70% ethanol and UV radiation, and coated overnight with 0.1% polyethyleneimine in 25 mm borate buffer. Cells were dispensed into a silicon tube placed on an MEA to allow coverage of the 64 electrodes but not the perimeter reference electrodes; this tubing was removed 3 h later after cells had adhered to the MEA. Each electrode had a 20-μm diameter, an inter-electrode distance of 100 μm, an impedance of <22 kΩ (1 kHz, 50 mV applied sinusoidal wave), and an average RMS noise of 4.07 μV. For a recording session, the MEA was removed from the standard incubator and placed into a 34 °C incubator, allowed to recover for 15–30 min, and connected to a MED64 recording system (Alpha MED Sciences), and 60 s of activity was acquired at 20 kHz for each of 64 channels using MEA software. Analyses were performed using Matlab. Data were pre-processed by down-sampling the original resolution of 20 kHz to 1 kHz by taking the mean across samples within each bin time (other techniques such as taking the maximum value provided similar qualitative results). Confidence lines were computed by determining the mean and standard deviation of each channel over the 60-s window, followed by subtracting the standard deviation (S.D.) from the mean of each channel: Confidence-Linec = Meanc–(3 × S.D.c), where c indexes the channels. The same procedure was applied for every experimental condition, except the S.D. used to compute the confidence line was always calculated for the baseline condition. Peaks in each channel were identified by scanning through the 60-s time window and determining when the amplitude crossed the confidence line (i.e. went from a value above the confidence line to a value below it). The temporal distributions of peaks were obtained by computing the temporal interval between peaks, and averaging across all channels for a given condition. The distributions of amplitude were obtained by computing the difference between the peak amplitude and the confidence line: PeakAmplitudec,t = Amplitudec,t–ConfidenceLinec, where t indexes the timing of a peak, and Amplitudec,t is the raw amplitude of a channel c at peak t. Each MEA was analyzed separately by performing a Student's t test (α = 0.05, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons: 5 conditions × 5 cultures, α = 0.05/25 = 0.002). For each MEA, the average timing and amplitude of peaks for each individual channel was determined, followed by comparisons aimed at determining if there were significant differences in the timing and amplitude of peaks between the baseline and other conditions. Statistical Analyses—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made by analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Student's t test. When significant differences were observed, the Bonferroni test was employed for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was inferred at p < 0.05, unless a Bonferroni correction was applied (as noted above), in which case p < 0.002. 4-AP/bic Preconditioning Induces OGD Tolerance—Neuronal glutamatergic synaptic activity can be enhanced by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), which prolongs the duration of neuronal action potentials, and by bicuculline (bic), a GABAA receptor antagonist, which induces network disinhibition, resulting in action potential-dependent intracellular Ca2+ spiking and synaptic release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate (27.Tapia R. Medina-Ceja L. Pena F. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 34: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine if excitatory activity elevated in this manner induced tolerance to otherwise lethal OGD, rat cortical neuron cultures were exposed to 4-AP (2.5 mm) and bicuculline (50 μm) (4-AP/bic preconditioning) for 48 h, followed by washout and a 24-h recovery period, and exposed to 65–80 min OGD. In the absence of preconditioning, OGD resulted in destruction of neuronal morphology and substantial PI uptake and fluorescence; in contrast, OGD did not have these effects on preconditioned cultures, because neuronal morphology was preserved and PI fluorescence was negligible (Fig. 1, A–H). Bicuculline treatment alone was not as effective as 4-AP/bic in providing OGD tolerance (data not shown). To confirm Ca2+ spiking by preconditioning, neuronal intracellular Ca2+ levels were monitored in Fluo-4-loaded cultures. The frequency and amplitude of action-potential-dependent Ca2+ spikes increased above background levels upon exposure to bicuculline, and was further increased with the co-addition of 4-AP (Fig. 1I). Hence, preconditioning by bicuculline alone might have failed due to insufficient elevation of electrical activity. Blocking Na+ channels with TTX eliminated Ca2+ spiking induced by 4-AP/bic (Fig. 1I), confirming a required role for electrically driven Ca2+ spiking (16.Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). The range of conditions able to provide OGD tolerance was determined by varying the concentration of 4-AP, and the durations of exposure to 4-AP/bic and recovery period following 4-AP/bic washout (Fig. 1, J–P). Concentrations of 4-AP ranging from 20 μm (“low”) to 2500 μm (“high”) in 4-AP/bic treatments all provided robust OGD tolerance, with 24–48 h representing an optimum length of treatment. The optimum recovery period following 4-AP/bic washout was 0–48 h; a 72-h interval resulted in some loss of OGD tolerance for low 4-AP/bic preconditioning, whereas a 96-h interval resulted in no protection against OGD for any 4-AP concentration. Arguing against protection by any 4-AP/bic remaining after washout, subjecting neurons to 4-AP/bic during OGD was not neuroprotective (data not shown). Exposing neurons to 4-AP/bic for only 4 h did not induce OGD tolerance (Fig. 1P), suggesting the requirement for a minimum duration of exposure. The ability of 4-AP to induce OGD tolerance at concentrations two orders of magnitude lower than a lethal concentration (∼5 mm; data not shown) suggests that preconditioning did not threaten neuronal survival. Because excessive activation of glutamate or NMDA receptors (excitotoxicity) underlies neuronal death induced by OGD, we attempted to confirm tolerance to lethal glutamate or NMDA receptor activation by 4-AP/bic preconditioning (20.Bengtson C.P. Dick O. Bading H. BMC. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28.Hardingham G.E. Arnold F.J. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), but were not successful (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B, respectively). In view of this discrepancy, we evaluated if apoptotic tolerance could be confirmed. Tolerance to staurosporine during 4-AP/bic treatment (acute) was not observed (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B), but tolerance to this apoptotic agent added after 4-AP/bic washout (delayed) was verified (supplemental Fig. S2C) (16.Hardingham G.E. Fukunaga Y. Bading H. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar, 20.Bengtson C.P. Dick O. Bading H. BMC. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Overall, the different neurotoxicity profiles might be attributed to different neuron culture systems (hippocampals elsewhere versus corticals). Receptor Dependence of Preconditioning—Receptors activated during preconditioning were identified by evaluating whether including a receptor antagonist during preconditioning suppressed OGD tolerance; both the highest (2500 μm, Fig. 2A) and lowest (20 μm, Fig. 2B) 4-AP concentrations were evaluated, because additional receptors can be activated at millimolar 4-AP concentrations (29.Rogawski M.A. Barker J.L. Brain Res. 1983; 280: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A Na+ channel blocker, TTX, reversed OGD tolerance produced by both high and low 4-AP/bic (although TTX was moderately protective on its own for an unknown reason). Thus, action potential-dependent neurotransmitter release was required for development of OGD tolerance. Protection against OGD was significantly suppressed by the presence of memantine (12.5 μm) during exposure to low (Fig. 2B) but not high (Fig. 2A) 4-AP/bic treatment. Memantine may not fully block rapid activation of the NMDA receptor during an action potential (30.Chen H.S. Pellegrini J.W. Aggarwal S.K. Lei S.Z. Warach S. Jensen F.E. Lipton S.A. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4427-4436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so we examined a higher affinity antagonist, MK-801. However, in a control experiment, exposing cultures to MK-801 alone induced tolerance to subsequent OGD (supplemental Fig. S3), possibly due to the presence of residual antagonist and/or induction of a preconditioning stress response (31.Tremblay R. Chakravarthy B. Hewitt K. Tauskela J. Morley P. Atkinson T. Durkin J.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7183-7192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protective effect likely accounted for why MK-801 did not reverse 4-AP/bic induced tolerance to OGD. Summarizing, a role for NMDA receptors was established using memantine. Blocking l-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (L-VGCCs) with nifedipine or AMPA receptors with NBQX during low 4-AP/bic preconditioning partially suppressed OGD tolerance (Fig. 2B), but neither of these antagonists had any effect on high 4-AP/bic preconditioning (Fig. 2A). Combining memantine with nifedipine more effectively suppressed OGD tolerance than by either antagonist alone for both high (Fig. 2A) or low (Fig. 2B) 4-AP/bic preconditioning, suggesting that co-activation of NMDA receptors and L-VGCCs contributes to the generation of OGD tolerance. Preconditioning accomplished by inducing epileptiform activity by kainic acid administration in vivo induces activation of adenosine A1 receptors and KATP channels (32.Plamondon H. Blondeau N. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1999"
https://openalex.org/W2169144949,"Background The role of enterococci in the pathogenesis of polymicrobial infections is still debated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of virulent enterococci in the presence or absence of Escherichia coli strains in the in vivo Caenorhabditis elegans model. Principal Findings This study demonstrated that there was a synergistic effect on virulence when an association of enterococci and E. coli (LT50 = 1.6 days±0.1 according to the tested strains and death of nematodes in 4 days±0.5) was tested in comparison with enterococci alone (LT50 = 4.6 days±0.1 and death in 10.4 days±0.6) or E. coli alone (LT50 = 2.1±0.9 and deaths 6.6±0.6) (p<0.001). In addition, there was a relation between the virulence of E. faecalis strains alone and the virulence potential of the association with E. coli strains. Finally, in the presence of avirulent E. coli strains, enterococci have no effect (LT50 = 4.3±0.5 and deaths in 10.8±0.8), independently of the level of their own virulence, demonstrating that the ‘enterococci effect’ only occurred in the presence of virulent E. coli strains. Conclusion This study allows a better understanding of a bacterial cooperation. Moreover, it could help to optimize the antibiotic regimen during polymicrobial infections."

It is largely unknown how Eg5 expression is regulated in cells. In this study, we present the first evidence that the cellular Eg5 level is down-regulated by Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase well known for its role in the development of Parkinson disease. Our data show that Parkin does not trigger Eg5 protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Instead, Parkin represses Eg5 gene transcription by blocking c-Jun binding to the activator protein 1 site present in the Eg5 promoter. Our data further show that Parkin inactivates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), resulting in decreased phosphorylation of c-Jun. The inactivation of JNK is further mediated by multiple monoubiquitination of Hsp70. Importantly, both the ubiquitination of Hsp70 and the subsequent inactivation of the JNK-c-Jun pathway are crucial for Parkin to down-regulate Eg5 expression. These results thus uncover a novel function for Parkin in modulating the expression of Eg5 through the Hsp70-JNK-c-Jun signaling pathway.

Chromosome segregation during cell division is orchestrated by the mitotic spindle, a bipolar apparatus composed of microtubules and their associated proteins. The bipolar organization of the spindle is crucial for accurate segregation of chromosomes and relies on microtubule-dependent motor proteins (1Wittmann T. Hyman A. Desai A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E28-E34Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 2Walczak C.E. Heald R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2008; 265: 111-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Eg5, a member of the kinesin family, is one of the best characterized motor proteins that function in bipolar spindle assembly (3Kashina A.S. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 4Kapitein L.C. Peterman E.J. Kwok B.H. Kim J.H. Kapoor T.M. Schmidt C.F. Nature. 2005; 435: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Eg5 has a highly conserved NH2-terminal catalytic motor domain and can hydrolyze ATP to move processively toward the plus ends of microtubules (5Valentine M.T. Gilbert S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence demonstrates that Eg5 functions as a homotetramer, with two motor domains at each end of a central stalk, and contributes to spindle assembly by cross-linking and pushing apart adjacent interpolar microtubules (4Kapitein L.C. Peterman E.J. Kwok B.H. Kim J.H. Kapoor T.M. Schmidt C.F. Nature. 2005; 435: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In addition, Eg5 can tether microtubule plus ends and condense microtubules into bundles, which may also contribute to spindle morphogenesis (4Kapitein L.C. Peterman E.J. Kwok B.H. Kim J.H. Kapoor T.M. Schmidt C.F. Nature. 2005; 435: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Besides its role in spindle formation, Eg5 has recently been implicated in tumorigenesis (6Castillo A.

Luciferase Reporter Assay—Eg5 promoter activity was measured by using the Eg5 promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid pEg5-Luc and the β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid pcDNA3-LacZ. In the pEg5-Luc plasmid, the Eg5 promoter (from -1264, -1223, -1186, or -1121 to the major site of transcriptional initiation) was used to drive the luciferase gene. The luciferase activity was measured using the FB12 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Protein Turnover Assay—Cells were treated with cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) for 0, 6, 12, 24, or 36 h. The level of Eg5 or CDCrel-1 at different time points was examined by Western blot analysis and quantified by densitometric analysis of the Western blot bands. Protein-Oligonucleotide Binding Assay—Nuclear extracts were incubated in 96-well plates with immobilized oligonucleotide sequences that contain the AP1 site. The plates were incubated in succession with c-Jun antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and SigmaFast peroxidase substrate (Sigma). The absorbance at a wave-length of 450 nm was then measured to quantify c-Jun/AP1 binding site activity. Immunocomplex Kinase Assay—JNK activity was measured using the immunocomplex JNK kinase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Calbiochem). Parkin Down-regulates Eg5 in a Ubiquitin Ligase-dependent Manner—To identify proteins regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin, we analyzed the protein expression profiles of cells treated with Parkin adenoviruses and compared with those treated with control adenoviruses. Such an analysis revealed significant down-regulation of the mitotic kinesin Eg5, along with several known substrates of Parkin such as CDCrel-1 (10Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The down-regulation of Eg5 by Parkin was confirmed by Western blot analysis; as shown in Fig. 1A, Parkin adenoviruses decreased cellular Eg5 level in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous Parkin increased Eg5 expression (Fig. 1B). We also found that the down-regulatory effect of Parkin on Eg5 expression disappeared when ligase-dead mutant Parkin adenoviruses were used (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Parkin is required for its inhibition of Eg5 level. Parkin Does Not Trigger Eg5 Degradation through the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway—We then examined whether Parkin down-regulates Eg5 by promoting Eg5 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This possibility was tested by blocking proteasome function with a specific inhibitor, MG132. We found that MG132 prevented the activity of Parkin to down-regulate CDCrel-1, but not Eg5 (Fig. 2A), indicating that the decrease of Eg5 by Parkin might not be mediated by proteasome-dependent protein degradation. In addition, we found that Parkin adenoviruses did not trigger the ubiquitination of Eg5, although CDCrel-1 was clearly ubiquitinated (Fig. 2B). Immunoprecipitation experiments further revealed that Parkin was able to interact with CDCrel-1 but not with Eg5 (Fig. 2C). Thus, Eg5 is not a direct substrate for the ubiquitin ligase activity of Parkin. We also examined the effect of Parkin on Eg5 stability by measuring the half-life of Eg5 via protein turnover assay. Such an experiment revealed an Eg5 half-life of 13.6 h, which was not significantly changed by Parkin adenoviruses (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the half-life of CDCrel-1 was remarkably decreased by treatment with Parkin adenoviruses (Fig. 2D). Together, these data demonstrate that Parkin does not cause Eg5 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Eg5 Is Down-regulated by Parkin at the Transcriptional Level—We then investigated whether the down-regulation of Eg5 by Parkin occurs at the messenger level by measuring Eg5 mRNA expression. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that Parkin, but not its ligase-dead mutant, reduced Eg5 mRNA expression in cells (Fig. 3A). In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous Parkin could increase Eg5 mRNA expression (Fig. 3B). Luciferase reporter assay using the Eg5 promoter further showed that Parkin, but not its ligase-dead mutant, significantly decreased Eg5 promoter activity (Fig. 3C), indicating that Parkin might down-regulate Eg5 at the transcriptional level. To further analyze the repression of Eg5 gene transcription by Parkin, we transfected cells with a series of luciferase reporter plasmids, including pEg5(-1264)-Luc, pEg5(-1223)-Luc, pEg5(-1186)-Luc, and pEg5(-1121)-Luc, which are driven by different sizes of Eg5 promoter (from -1264, -1223, -1186, or -1121 to the major site of transcriptional initiation) (Fig. 3, D and E). Cells transfected with pEg5(-1264)-Luc and pEg5(-1223)-Luc together with Parkin had comparable, low luciferase activities (Fig. 3D). Strikingly, in cells transfected with pEg5(-1186)-Luc or pEg5(-1121)-Luc, the Parkin-induced decrease in Eg5 luciferase activity was largely blocked (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that the nucleotide sequence between -1223 and -1186 in the Eg5 promoter might contain a cis-regulatory DNA element that mediates the transcriptional down-regulation of Eg5 by Parkin. A web-based navigation through transcription factor binding databases, using the Parkin response sequence -1223 to -1186 as bait, identified a putative binding site for the heterodimeric transcription factor AP1 (notably c-Jun/c-Fos, (15Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar)), located from -1194 to -1188 in the Eg5 promoter (Fig. 3E). To examine whether the repression of Eg5 gene transcription by Parkin is mediated by the AP1 binding site, luciferase reporter assay was performed using an Eg5 promoter harboring mutations in the AP1 site. We found that Parkin-induced reduction of Eg5 promoter activity was completely blocked by AP1 site mutations (Fig. 3F), indicating a critical role for the AP1 site in mediating Eg5 down-regulation by Parkin. Parkin Decreases Eg5 Expression by Inactivation of the JNK-c-Jun Pathway and Inhibition of c-Jun Binding to the AP1 Site in the Eg5 Promoter—Using a protein-oligonucleotide binding assay, we further found that Parkin, but not its ligase-dead mutant, significantly inhibited c-Jun binding to the AP1 site (Fig. 4A). To further investigate the role of c-Jun inhibition in mediating Eg5 down-regulation by Parkin, we overexpressed c-Jun and then examined the effect of Parkin on Eg5 expression. We found that adenovirus-mediated c-Jun overexpression completely blocked the ability of Parkin to decrease the Eg5 level (Fig. 4B). In addition, c-Jun overexpression could inhibit the ability of Parkin to decrease the Eg5 transcription and mRNA level (Fig. 4, C and D). Interestingly, overexpression of c-Jun per se could increase Eg5 expression (Fig. 4, B–D), supporting a role for this transcription factor in promoting Eg5 gene expression. We also found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of c-Jun could facilitate the down-regulatory effect of Parkin on the Eg5 transcription and mRNA levels (Fig. 4, E and F). Collectively, these results reveal that Parkin decreases Eg5 expression by inhibiting c-Jun binding to the AP1 site in the Eg5 promoter. We then wanted to identify the link between Parkin and c-Jun in the context of Eg5 down-regulation. A natural hypothesis was that Parkin might inactivate JNK, which in turn decreases c-Jun phosphorylation and inhibits c-Jun binding to the AP1 site in the Eg5 promoter. To test this hypothesis, JNK activity upon Parkin overexpression was examined by immunocomplex kinase assay. We observed a significant decrease of JNK activity by Parkin, but not by the ligase-dead mutant (Fig. 5A). In addition, we found that blocking proteasome function with MG132 did not affect the ability of Parkin to inactivate JNK (data not shown). To study the role for JNK inactivation in the down-regulation of Eg5 by Parkin, we overexpressed JNK and then examined the effect of Parkin on Eg5 expression. We found that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of JNK, like the overexpression of c-Jun, could entirely inhibit the activity of Parkin to decrease Eg5 transcription and its protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 5, B–D). In addition, overexpression of JNK per se was also able to increase Eg5 expression (Fig. 5, B–D). Together, these data demonstrate a critical role for JNK inactivation in mediating Eg5 down-regulation by Parkin. Hsp70 Ubiquitination Is Critical for Parkin to Inactivate JNK and to Decrease Eg5 Expression—We next investigated the molecular mechanism by which Parkin leads to JNK inactivation. It is clearly linked to the ubiquitin ligase-associated function of Parkin because the ligase-dead mutant could not inactivate JNK. Given that the JNK signaling is known to be regulated by ubiquitination events (16Laine A. Ronai Z. Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005: re5Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), it was possible that Parkin might inactivate JNK by triggering the ubiquitination of cellular proteins involved in the regulation of JNK activity. The failure of MG132 to prevent Parkin-induced JNK inactivation and Eg5 down-regulation further suggested that Parkin-mediated ubiquitination of such proteins does not result in their degradation by the proteasome. Potential targets include Hsp70, NEMO, and Traf2, which undergo degradation-independent ubiquitination by Parkin and are also implicated in the regulation of JNK activity (17Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Volloch V.Z. Sherman M.Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 18Henn I.H. Bouman L. Schlehe J.S. Schlierf A. Schramm J.E. Wegener E. Nakaso K. Culmsee C.

Science. 2008; 321: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of Hsp70, NEMO, and Traf2 in Parkin-induced JNK inactivation and Eg5 down-regulation, cells were treated with control or Parkin adenoviruses together with adenoviruses encoding Hsp70, Hsp70 antisense RNA, NEMO, NEMO antisense RNA, Traf2, or Traf2 antisense RNA. We found that Hsp70 adenoviruses could facilitate the inhibitory effects of Parkin on JNK activity and the Eg5 level, whereas adenoviruses encoding Hsp70 antisense RNA largely blocked the above effects (Fig. 6A). In contrast, adenoviruses encoding NEMO, NEMO antisense RNA, Traf2, or Traf2 antisense RNA did not alter the effects of Parkin on JNK activity and Eg5 level (Fig. 6A). These results indicate the importance of Hsp70 in Parkin-induced inactivation of JNK and down-regulation of Eg5. Using antibodies that specifically recognize poly-ubiquitinated proteins (clone FK1) or both mono- and poly-ubiquitinated proteins (clone FK2), we further found that Parkin, but not the ligase-dead mutant, induced multiple mono-ubiquitination of Hsp70 (Fig. 6B). This result was in agreement with the previous finding achieved with SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (19Moore D.J. West A.B. Dikeman D.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurochem. 2008; 105: 1806-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We next studied whether Hsp70 mono-ubiquitination is linked to the effects of Parkin on JNK activity and the Eg5 level. Cells were treated with control or Parkin adenoviruses, together with adenoviruses encoding wild-type or the lysine-less mutant Hsp70. As shown in Fig. 6C, Parkin-mediated Hsp70 mono-ubiquitination was significantly enhanced upon treatment with wild-type Hsp70 adenoviruses. In contrast, the mono-ubiquitination of Hsp70 was entirely abolished upon treatment with lysine-less mutant Hsp70 adenoviruses. This result suggests that the lysine-less mutant functions in a dominant-negative manner in cells. On the other hand, the result supports an essential role for lysine residues in mediating the ubiquitination of Hsp70 similar to the ubiquitination of many other proteins (21Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2865) Google Scholar). Most importantly, we found that whereas wild-type Hsp70 facilitated the inhibitory effects of Parkin on JNK activity and Eg5 level, lysine-less mutant Hsp70 abolished the above effects. These data thus reveal that Hsp70 ubiquitination is critical for Parkin to inactivate JNK and to decrease the Eg5 level. Eg5 is a microtubule-dependent motor protein of the kinesin family and plays an important role in mitotic spindle assembly (3Kashina A.S. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 4Kapitein L.C. Peterman E.J. Kwok B.H. Kim J.H. Kapoor T.M. Schmidt C.F. Nature. 2005; 435: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Chemical compounds that inhibit Eg5 activity have emerged as a new generation of anticancer agents that are currently under clinical investigation (22Duhl D.M. Renhowe P.A. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2005; 8: 431-436PubMed Google Scholar). Because Eg5 is hardly detectable in post-mitotic neurons and mainly acts in dividing cells (23Sakowicz R. Finer J.T. Beraud C. Crompton A. Lewis E. Fritsch A. Lee Y. Mak J. Moody R. Turincio R. Chabala J.C. Gonzales P. Roth S. Weitman S. Wood K.W. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3276-3280Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), its inhibitors are expected to offer better specificity for cancer treatment than microtubule-targeted drugs, which often result in neurotoxicity (24Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Eg5 has been implicated in tumorigenesis due to its activation in mouse B-cell leukemia, overexpression in blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia, and triggering of genomic instability in transgenic mice (6Castillo A. Morse 3rd, H.C. Godfrey V.L. Naeem R. Justice M.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 10138-10147Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7Hansen G.M. Justice M.J.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3952-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of Eg5 expression is largely unknown, our data presented in this study demonstrate that the cellular Eg5 level is down-regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin. In addition, we find that the ability of Parkin to decrease Eg5 is dependent on its ubiquitin ligase activity. These findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for Parkin in regulating Eg5 expression. Given the critical function of Eg5 in mitotic spindle formation, it would not be surprising if a mitotic role for Parkin is identified in the future, although the majority of research in the past decade has been focused on its involvement in Parkinson disease (25Cookson M.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The present study also provides mechanistic insights into how Parkin down-regulates Eg5 expression in cells. Our data show that although this action of Parkin requires its ubiquitin ligase activity, it does not trigger proteasome-dependent Eg5 degradation. This feature is clearly different from the action of Parkin toward many of its substrate proteins such as CDCrel-1 (10Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). We find that Parkin down-regulates Eg5 by inhibiting Eg5 gene transcription, which is dependent on the AP1 binding site located in the Eg5 promoter. In addition, our data show that Parkin inactivates JNK and inhibits c-Jun binding to the AP1 site, and that inactivation of the JNK-c-Jun pathway is important for Parkin to down-regulate Eg5. These findings thus establish a critical role for the JNK-c-Jun signaling cascade in mediating the effect of Parkin on Eg5 gene expression. It should be noted, however, that the connection between the JNK pathway and the kinesin family proteins is not unprecedented. For example, JNK-interacting proteins bind directly to kinesins to allow the loading of different cargoes as well as to control cargo release (26Verhey K.J. Rapoport T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 545-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Koushika S.P. Bioessays. 2008; 30: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, the JNK pathway has also been proposed to link Parkin mutations to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in the development of Parkinson disease (28Jankowski M. Postepy Biochem. 2007; 53: 297-303PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the present study provides the first evidence demonstrating a role for the JNK pathway in mediating the effect of Parkin on Eg5 expression. Regarding the mechanisms by which Parkin inactivates JNK, our data demonstrate a critical requirement for Hsp70 mono-ubiquitination. This is supported by the finding that Hsp70 facilitates the inhibitory effects of Parkin on JNK activity and Eg5 level, whereas Hsp70 antisense RNA diminishes the above effects. Moreover, the lysine-less mutant Hsp70, which abrogates the ubiquitination of Hsp70 in a dominant-negative manner, also blocks the inhibitory effects of Parkin on JNK activity and Eg5 level. These findings reveal that Hsp70 mono-ubiquitination is crucial for Parkin to inactivate JNK and to decrease the Eg5 level. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of how Hsp70 mono-ubiquitination is involved in the above processes. We are grateful to Drs. Ted Dawson, Jian Feng, Dick Mosser, and Ceshi Chen for providing reagents and members of the Zhou laboratory for discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2112188937,"The clinical severity of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), also known as the brittle bone disease, relates to the extent of conformational changes in the collagen triple helix induced by Gly substitution mutations. The lingering question is why Gly substitutions at different locations of collagen cause different disruptions of the triple helix. Here, we describe markedly different conformational changes of the triple helix induced by two Gly substitution mutations placed only 12 residues apart. The effects of the Gly substitutions were characterized using a recombinant collagen fragment modeling the 63-residue segment of the ;1 chain of type I collagen containing no Hyp (residues 877-939) obtained from Escherichia coli. Two Gly → Ser substitutions at Gly-901 and Gly-913 associated with, respectively, mild and severe OI variants were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Biophysical characterization and limited protease digestion experiments revealed that while the substitution at Gly-901 causes relatively minor destabilization of the triple helix, the substitution at Gly-913 induces large scale unfolding of an unstable region C-terminal to the mutation site. This extensive unfolding is caused by the intrinsic low stability of the C-terminal region of the helix and the mutation induced disruption of a set of salt bridges, which functions to lock this unstable region into the triple helical conformation. The extensive conformational changes associated with the loss of the salt bridges highlight the long range impact of the local interactions of triple helix and suggest a new mechanism by which OI mutations cause severe conformational damages in collagen.

The collagen triple helix consists of three polypeptide chains each in extended polyproline II conformation and with the characteristic (Gly-X-Y)n repeating amino acid sequence (1Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 2Rich A. Crick F.H.C. J. Mol.

Missense mutations that replace the obligatory Gly by another amino acid residue in type I collagen, the major component of bones, are the most common cause of OI (5Byers P.H. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Osteogenesis Imperfecta, Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 317-350Google Scholar, 6Marini J.C. Forlino A. Cabral W.A. Barnes A.M. Antonio J.D.S. Milgrom S.

The triple helix domain of type I collagen is a heterotrimer composed of two ;1 chains and one ;2 chain each with more than 1000 amino acids in an uninterrupted (Gly-X-Y)n sequence (7Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar). Nearly 800 Gly replacing mutations from both ;1 and ;2 chains have been linked to OI, yet, depending on the location and the identity of the Gly substitution, the clinical severity of OI varies from mild increase of bone fragility to the most severe type characterized by death at the prenatal stage (the Type II OI) (6Marini J.C. Forlino A. Cabral W.A. Barnes A.M. Antonio J.D.S. Milgrom S. Hyland J.C. Korkko J. Prockop D.J. Paepe A.D. Coucke P. Symoens S. Glorieux F.H. Roughley P.J. Lund A.M. Kuurila-Svahn K. Hartikka H.

It remains unclear what molecular properties are related to the sequence locations of the Gly substitutions, which in turn affect the properties of bones. The prevailing domain model of OI directly links the OI phenotype to the local helix stability surrounding a mutation. The triple helix is not uniform in structure and stability, but organized into thermally stable and labile domains along the axis of the helix (4Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A.M. Brodsky B. J. Biol.

Mutations disrupting highly stabilizing regions of the helix are considered to be more damaging to the conformation than those in the more flexible, thermally labile regions and thus, predicted to be more severe (12Bachinger H.P. Morris N.P. Davis J.M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1993; 45: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). While the conformational heterogeneity was clearly demonstrated in biophysical characterizations of the full-chain collagens (8Privalov P.L. Tictopulo E.I. Tischenko V.M. J. Mol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 4787-4798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the relations between the conformational heterogeneity and the severity of the OI has not yet been established. In fact, a recent study systematically mapping out the effects of 41 OI mutations on the melting temperature (ΔTm) of type I collagen reported no direct correlation between the ΔTm of the mutants and the severity of OI, and no straight forward relationships between the ΔTm and the local helix stability (11Makareeva E. Mertz E.L. Kuznetsova N.V. Sutter M.B. DeRidder A.M. Cabral W.A. Barnes A.M. McBride D.J. Marini J.C. Leikin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4787-4798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Experimentally examining such correlations is difficult because of the large size, and the rope-like conformation of the collagen. Studies using full-chain collagens are often limited to relying on macroscopic parameters such as the ΔTm, which does not imply any specific changes of the conformation (11Makareeva E. Mertz E.L. Kuznetsova N.V. Sutter M.B. DeRidder A.M. Cabral W.A. Barnes A.M. McBride D.J. Marini J.C. Leikin S. J. Biol.

Given the long, rope-like structure of the triple helix, a mutation could critically alter the surrounding conformations of the triple helix without causing significant changes in Tm of the whole molecule. On the other hand, the local stability of a segment of the triple helix is often derived from the data obtained from short, synthetic peptides. Despite extensive peptide studies on the stabilizing/destabilizing effects of isolated X or Y residues and of the intrachain and interchain molecular interactions involving both X and Y residues in one Gly-X-Y tripeptide or in two adjacent tripeptides (Gly-X-Y-Gly-X′-Y′), how these interactions modulate each other in the context of the long helix of collagen remain largely unknown (4Persikov A.V.

We have developed an E. coli expression system for recombinant collagen fragments to overcome the limitations of the studies using full-chain collagens or short synthetic peptides. The recombinant collagen fragments were used to model the 63-residue segment of the ;1 chain of type I collagen corresponding to residues 877-939 (a region containing no hydroxyproline). The optimal size of the fragments allow us to reveal markedly different effects on the triple helix conformation by two OI mutations placed only 12 residues apart, and to correlate the severe OI to a mutation causing more extensive unfolding of a segment of the triple helix known to be involved in the molecular interactions of type I collagen. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that the extensive unfolding is caused by the interruption of a set of interchain salt-bridges formed between the Lys and Glu residues of a KGE sequence. Such interchain salt bridges (from a KGE or KGD sequence) are known to stabilize the short peptides (4Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A.M. Brodsky B. J. Biol.

Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In our model system, the stabilizing interactions of the salt bridges extended through a region containing more than 20 amino acid residues C-terminal to the KGE sequence. Thus, by revealing the long range impacts of the salt bridges, our data highlight the critical roles of the salt bridges in modulating the stabilities of the neighboring regions of the triple helix. Based on these findings, a new mechanism by which OI mutations cause severe conformational changes of collagen is proposed. Expression of the Recombinant Fragments—The expression plasmids were built on the (Gly-Pro-Pro)10-foldon construct (generously provided by Dr. Jurgen Engel). The gene coding for the F877 (including the repeating Gly-Pro-Pro sequences and the Gly-Pro-Cys-Cys-Gly-Pro at the C-terminal end) bracketed by BamHI sites were synthesized by GenScript with the codon optimization for bacteria expression, and subsequently cloned into the (Gly-Pro-Pro)10 site (Diagram 1). The fragments were expressed in JM109 and induced by 0.01 mm isopropyl-1-thio-;-d-galactopyranoside. Two Gly → Ser substitutions were introduced by point mutagenesis at position 901 (the G901S) and 913 (the G913S) (Diagram 1) using QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The gene product of the expression plasmid is a fusion protein including His-tagged thioredoxin at the N-terminal end (Diagram 1). The purification of the fragments involves two steps. During the first step, the His-tagged fusion protein was purified from the cell extract using TALON® metal affinity resin (Clontech) following the manufacturer's procedure and eluted by 300 mm imidazole. To reduce the contamination of nonspecific binding, the incubation buffer contains 50 mm imidazole. The thrombin cleavage was carried out using Thrombin CleanCleave® kit (Sigma) after incubation overnight at 37 °C. Because of the interaction between the thioredoxin and the collagen fragments, the thioredoxin was removed by gel filtration in the presence of 6 m urea, followed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline buffer (10 mm, pH 7, with 127 mm NaCl and 2.7 mm KCl). The final collagen fragments are more than 97% pure, based on the analysis using gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. The molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectrometry. All three fragments were purified in their trimer form based on gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation studies (see “Results”). A set of interchain disulfide bonds between the triple helical domain and the foldon domain is expected to cross-link the three chains and to further increase the stability of the triple helix. However, SDS-PAGE analysis revealed ∼10% trimers dissociated to monomers by boiling in SDS without the addition of reducing agent. Because the cross-linking feature does not affect the current study, the small population of non-cross-linked trimers was not further removed from the preparation. Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded using an AVIV 200 CD spectrometer equipped with a Peltier thermal controller with 1-mm optical length and 1-nm bandwidth. Baseline correction was done using the solvent and the same cuvette. For structure characterization low concentration samples (0.2 mg/ml) were used to keep the dynode voltage below 500 V in the far UV region. The temperature melt experiments were carried out using 1 mg/ml samples at an average heating rate of ∼0.1 °C/min. SDS-PAGE of samples conducted after the temperature melt experiment are identical with those done before melt with no obvious sign of UV-related fragmentation of the chains. All experiments were repeated at least three times with fresh samples. The concentration of the samples was calibrated using UV absorbance at 280 nm with the extinction coefficient of 0.71 cm-1 (mg/ml)-1. The fraction of folded triple helix was calculated as F(T) = (;(T) - ;uf)/(;N - ;uf), where ;(T) is the observed molar ellipticity at temperature T; ;N and ;uf are the molar ellipticity of folded and unfolded states, respectively, of the triple helix domain, obtained from linear extrapolation of data from 5 to 10 °C for the folded state and from 50 to 65 °C for the unfolded state. The CD signal at 225 nm in the unfolded state is not zero due to the presence of the foldon domain (see the section below). However, this contribution from foldon will not affect the melting curve of the triple helix domain because the foldon remains folded in the range of temperature used here. Protease Digestion—Chymotrypsin digestion experiments were carried out using chymotrypsin agarose resin (Sigma, C9134-50UN) in the ratio of 6.5 × 1010 unit/mol protein. Pepsin digestion was carried out using Immobilized Pepsin (Pierce, prod. 20343) with activity > 6000 unit/ml gel. The concentration of protein sample was 1 mg/ml. The digestion experiments for both proteases were carried out following the manufacturer's manual with 0.1 ml of protein at 1 mg/ml for every 100 ;l of agarose resin. Mass Spectrometry—For MALDI-TOF MS analysis (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of flight mass spectrometry), ;-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix was prepared as a saturated solution in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The sample and matrix were spotted 1:1 onto a sample plate and allowed to dry. All spectra were acquired using a MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometer Voyager-DE STR (PE Biosystem, Foster City, CA) in positive ion, linear, delayed extraction mode with a 337-nm nitrogen laser pulsing at 3 Hz. Spectra from 100 individual laser shots were averaged and externally calibrated. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—The equilibrium sedimentation experiments were performed on a Beckman XLI analytical ultracentrifuge using an An-60 Ti rotor and 12-mm Epon 8-channel short column centerpieces. The data were collected using both interference optics and absorbance at 280 nm at three different temperatures, with loading concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.2 mg/ml and speeds 22K, 30K, and 40K rpm. The data were analyzed using NONLIN software for windows (distributed by the National AUC facility at the University of Connecticut). Results obtained from interference data and from absorbance are in good agreement. The same samples were used for the temperature melt and the AUC experiments. The Recombinant Collagen Fragments—The complete sequence of the recombinant collagen fragment F877 mimicking the 63-residue region of the ;1(I) (residue 877-939) is shown in Diagram 1. To best model this region in the fully folded collagen and eliminate the effects of helix fraying at the ends, repeating sequences of the tripeptide Gly-Pro-Pro with high triple helix propensity were added at both the C and N termini. All together, the recombinant triple helix domain consists of 93 amino acid residues. The C-terminal foldon domain taken from bacteriophage T4 fibritin functions as the nucleation domain to facilitate the folding of the triple helix (16Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lusting A. Bachinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A short sequence containing two Cys residues (Gly-Pro-Cys-Cys-Gly) was included between the triple helix domain and the foldon domain. When oxidized in folded triple helix conformation, the Cys residues form a set of interchain disulfide bonds, also known as the Cys knot (17Mechling D.E. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14532-14536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), further increasing the stability of the triple helix. Two mutated fragments G901S and G913S containing Gly → Ser substitution at Gly-901 and Gly-913, respectively, were generated to model the effects of OI mutations on the ;1 chain of type I collagen. The substitution at Gly-901 causes the milder type of OI while that at Gly-913 is linked to the most severe type OI, type II OI (18Byers P.H. Wallis G.A. Willing M.C. J. Med. Genet. 1991; 28: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Triple Helix Conformation of All Three Fragments—The CD spectra of the three fragments (F877, G901S, and G913S) at 4 °C are nearly identical despite the presence of Gly substitutions (Fig. 1). The small positive peak at ∼225 nm and the deep negative peak at ∼197 nm are typical of that of a collagen triple helix (3Ramachandran G.N. Doyle B.B. Boult E.R. Biopolymers. 1968; 6: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The foldon domain has contributions to the peak at 225 nm (Fig. 1 and Ref. 16Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lusting A. Bachinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, the average molar ellipticity of ∼4690 deg cm2/dmol of the three fragments at 225 nm includes ∼20% contribution from the foldon domain. Small differences in the negative peak at 197 nm of the three fragments were observed. While this deep negative peak is often considered a more sensitive characterization of the triple helix conformation, its accurate estimation is often limited by strong absorption of the peptide backbone at the far UV region, especially for large molecules. The close agreement of the molar ellipticity of all three fragments (within experimental error of ± 2%) indicate that the inclusion of the (Gly-Pro-Pro)6 and the segment of triple helix N terminus to the mutation site(s) (residues 877-891) effectively helped the refolding of both G901S and G913S downstream from the mutation sites. The two substitutions appear to cause similarly limited distortions of the triple helix conformation. The Effects of OI Mutations on the Thermal Stability—While both form triple helixes at low temperature, the thermal unfolding profiles of the two mutated fragments are, however, considerably different (Fig. 2). The thermal stability was monitored by the change of the CD signal at 225 nm with temperature from 4 to 70 °C. The temperature of the thermal transition (Tm) of F877 is about 40 °C, significantly higher than that of native type I collagen (slightly lower than 37 °C (20Leikina E. Mertts M.V. Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1314-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar)) due to the stabilizing effects of foldon, the Cys-knot and the repeating Gly-Pro-Pro sequences. The Gly → Ser substitution at 901 decreases the thermal stability of F877 and reduces the Tm by ∼10 °C, while the overall unfolding profile remains similar. In contrast, the Gly substitution in G913S affects both the value of Tm and the shape of the unfolding profile. The melting curve reveals two steps in unfolding. The first step occurs at a much lower temperature, between 15 and 25 °C, and involves the decrease of about 40% of the ellipticity at 225 nm. The second melting step takes place between 29 and 35 °C causing the complete unfolding of the triple helix domain. The loss of the signal at 225 nm in Fig. 2 demonstrates the unfolding of the triple helix domain while the foldon domain remains folded in this temperature range. The Tm of foldon at the comparable concentration is ∼70 °C (16Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lusting A. Bachinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The presence of the Cys knot will further increase its stability. The CD spectrum of G913S taken at 70 °C (Fig. 1), after the triple helix completely unfolds, shows the typical features of a foldon domain. The analytical ultracentrifugation data further support the trimeric state of the fragments between 4 and 40 °C (Table 1, 40 °C is the highest temperature allowed by the instrument). The average molecular weight of all three samples does not change with temperature. Even when the entire triple helix conformation unfolds for G913S and G901S at 40 °C, they remain a trimer held together by the foldon and/or the Cys-knot. We have observed a low degree of nonspecific aggregation of the sample preparations, which worsens upon storage at 4 °C. This nonspecific aggregation is reflected in the slightly higher molecular weight averages of the samples compared with the expected value of a pure trimer.TABLE 1Molecular weight estimations at different temperaturesMonomer mol. wtMolecular weight averages4 °C15 °C40 °CkDakDakDakDaF87712.1943.57 (41.37, 46.57)aNumbers in parentheses are the error statistics (±95% confidence level) of the estimation.

The range is not symmetric with respect to the estimate, reflecting the nature of a nonlinear estimation algorithm. Open table in a new tab The close agreement of the molecular weight averages of G913S and F877 at both 4 °C and 15 °C (Table 1) indicates the first melting transition is not caused by the nonspecific aggregation of the sample. Had the 40% signal loss during the first melting step been caused by the dissociation of the aggregates in G913S sample, the molecular weight averages of G913S at 15 °C would be significantly lower than that of the F877, which is clearly not the case. Rather, the similar small decrease of the molecular weight averages with temperature in all three peptides indicates the nonspecific aggregates behave more or less in the same manner in all three samples. The temperature-dependent behavior of the aggregates would contribute similarly, if at all, to the temperature-induced CD signal changes for all three fragments. Gly-913 → Ser Induced Unfolding of the Pro-free Region—Proteolytic digestion is often used to assess the conformation of the triple helix (10Makareeva E. Cabral W.A. Marini J.C. Leikin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6463-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). When fully folded, the triple helix is known to be resistant to chymotrypsin and pepsin. While there are several pepsin cleavage sites in the construct, chymotrypsin was used to target a unique site, Phe-935, close to the C-terminal end of the triple helix. The protease digestion experiments were carried out at both 4 °C (Fig. 3A) and 15 °C (Fig. 3B). Preheated samples were used as controls in the experiments where the fragments of G913S were preheated to 70 °C for 2 h to induce the complete unfolding of the triple helix, followed by quickly cooling to the specified temperature for the proteolytic digestion. Because the refolding of the triple helix is exceedingly slow (22Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 23Engel J. Bachinger H.P. Matrix Biology. 2000; 19: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Xu Y. Bhate M. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8143-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), this preheated sample is expected to contain unfolded chains, which are susceptible to the proteases. All three fragments have the same level of resistance to chymotrypsin at 4 °C (Fig. 3A), indicating similar well folded conformation and consistent with the CD data (Fig. 1). Little digestion by chymotrypsin was observed for all three samples during the 15 min of incubation at 4 °C (gel pictures of F877 and G901S are identical with that of G913S and are not included in Fig. 3A due to space limitation), while the preheated sample was nearly completely digested by the end of the 15 min. Similar results were also seen for pepsin digestion experiments at 4 °C (Fig. 3C). A small degree of digestion was observed in both G913S and G901S after prolonged incubation in pepsin (60 min) reflecting the decreased stability of these two mutated chains. A significantly higher susceptibility of G913S to chymotrypsin was observed at 15 °C (Fig. 3B) as the G913S starts to get into the first melting step. Clear signs of digestion of G913S were observed after 1 min of incubation with the enzyme, with the digestion nearing completion after 15 min of incubation. On the other hand, both F877 and G901S are resistant to the enzyme after 15 min of incubation. The subsequent MS experiments have confirmed the digested samples of G913S contain a 5K species corresponding to the fragment from the C-terminal to the Phe-935, and a ∼7K species corresponding to the fragment N terminus to the digestion site (data not shown). We also observed the presence of fragments that were digested by chymotrypsin at the two Tyr residues inside the foldon domain after an extended period of incubation (overnight at 15 °C) in G913S but not in G901S and F877. It appears the removal or the unfolding of the triple helix domain have also destabilized the foldon domain and promoted the digestion at the Tyr residues. Both Tyr residues are not accessible in the fully folded foldon conformation. A close inspection of the amino acid sequence revealed that the 24 residues between Gly-916 a"
https://openalex.org/W2002808927,"The U2 auxiliary factor large subunit (U2AF65) is an essential pre-mRNA splicing factor for the initial stages of spliceosome assembly. Tandem RNA recognition motifs (RRM)s of U2AF65 recognize polypyrimidine tract signals adjacent to 3′ splice sites. Despite the central importance of U2AF65 for splice site recognition, the relative arrangement of the U2AF65 RRMs and the energetic forces driving polypyrimidine tract recognition remain unknown. Here, the solution conformation of the U2AF65 RNA binding domain determined using small angle x-ray scattering reveals a bilobal shape without apparent interdomain contacts. The proximity of the N and C termini within the inter-RRM configuration is sufficient to explain the action of U2AF65 on spliceosome components located both 5′ and 3′ to its binding site. Isothermal titration calorimetry further demonstrates that an unusually large enthalpy-entropy compensation underlies U2AF65 recognition of an optimal polyuridine tract. Qualitative similarities were observed between the pairwise distance distribution functions of the U2AF65 RNA binding domain and those either previously observed for N-terminal RRMs of Py tract-binding protein that lack interdomain contacts or calculated from the high resolution coordinates of a U2AF65 deletion variant bound to RNA. To further test this model, the shapes and RNA interactions of the wild-type U2AF65 RNA binding domain were compared with those of U2AF65 variants containing either Py tract-binding protein linker sequences or a deletion within the inter-RRM linker. Results of these studies suggest inter-RRM conformational plasticity as a possible means for U2AF65 to universally identify diverse pre-mRNA splice sites."

https://openalex.org/W2149799041,"Model class A amphipathic helical peptides mimic several properties of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein component of high density lipoproteins. Previously, we reported the NMR structures of Ac-18A-NH2 (renamed as 2F because of two phenylalanines), the base-line model class A amphipathic helical peptide in the presence of lipid (Mishra, V. K., Anantharamaiah, G. M., Segrest, J. P., Palgunachari, M. N., Chaddha, M., Simon Sham, S. W., and Krishna, N. R. (2006) J Biol. Chem. 281, 6511-6519). Substitution of two Leu residues on the nonpolar face (Leu3 and Leu14) with Phe residues produced the peptide 4F (so named because of four phenylalanines), which has been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic properties. Like 2F, 4F also forms discoidal nascent high density lipoprotein-like particles with 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC). Since subtle structural changes in the peptide-lipid complexes have been shown to be responsible for their antiatherogenic properties, we undertook high resolution NMR studies to deduce detailed structure of 4F in 4F·DMPC discs. Like 2F, 4F adopts a well defined amphipathic ;-helical structure in association with the lipid at a 1:1 peptide/lipid weight ratio. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy revealed a number of intermolecular close contacts between the aromatic residues in the hydrophobic face of the helix and the lipid acyl chain protons. Similar to 2F, the pattern of observed peptide-lipid NOEs is consistent with a parallel orientation of the amphipathic ; helix, with respect to the plane of the lipid bilayer, on the edge of the disc (the belt model). However, in contrast to 2F in 2F·DMPC, 4F in the 4F·DMPC complex is located closer to the lipid headgroup as evidenced by a number of NOEs between 4F and DMPC headgroup protons. These NOEs are absent in the 2F·DMPC complex. In addition, the conformation of the DMPC sn-3 chain in 4F·DMPC complex is different than in the 2F·DMPC complex as evidenced by the NOE between lipid 2.CH and ;CH2 protons in 4F·DMPC, but not in 2F·DMPC, complex.

The motif that is responsible for the association of apoA-I with lipid was determined as tandem repeating amphipathic ;-helical domains that are present throughout the sequence of apoA-I.

A number of variations of 2F peptide were synthesized by replacing existing nonpolar amino acids with Phe residues on the nonpolar face.

Although the lipid-associated structure of 2F has been determined (15Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Palgunachari M.N. Chaddha M. Sham S.W.S. Krishna N.R. J. Biol.

In this paper, we describe the lipid-associated structure of 4F in an effort to understand unique properties of this peptide that may be responsible for its anti-inflammatory properties. The helical wheel and helical net representations of 4F are shown in Fig. 1. The location of Phe residues in 4F that were substituted for Leu in 2F are indicated by arrows in Fig. 1.MATERIALS AND METHODSPeptide Synthesis, Purification, and NMR Sample Preparation—The peptide 4F (Ac-DWFKAFYDKVAEKFKEAFNH2) was synthesized and purified as described earlier (16Datta G. Chaddha M. Hama S. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Garber D.W. Mishra V.K. Epand R.M. Epand R.F. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Segrest J.P. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1096-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two separate sets of samples were prepared for the NMR studies: (a) perdeuterated 1,2-dimyristoyl-d54-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine-1,1,2,2-d4-N,N,N-trimethyl-d9 (DMPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL) and peptide in 90% H2O, 10% D2O (100% deuterium oxide; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) and (b) protonated DMPC and peptide in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. To prepare these samples, lyophilized dry peptide was dissolved in methanol. DMPC (either protonated or perdeuterated) was dissolved separately in methanol. Appropriate amounts of peptide and DMPC solutions were mixed together to obtain a peptide/total lipid ratio of 1:1 (w/w). Organic solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas, and the mixture was lyophilized to remove any residual solvent. To the dry peptide and lipid film, 0.6 ml of 5 mm KH2PO4 was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C overnight. The pH of the final solution was 5.5. The final peptide concentration in solution was ∼3 mm.Size of the Discoidal Peptide-Lipid Complex—Apparent size of the discoidal peptide-lipid complex was determined using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (BioLogic, DuoFlow; Bio-Rad) and Superose 6 10/300 GL and Superdex 200 10/300 GL columns (Amersham Biosciences) linked in tandem and run at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% sodium azide (pH 7.4). Complex elution was monitored using absorbance at 280 nm. The apparent Stokes diameter of the complex was estimated using high and low molecular weight calibration kits (Amersham Biosciences). The void and total volume of the columns were determined using blue dextran and K3(Fe(CN)6), respectively. The amounts of lipid and peptide in the eluted peak fraction were measured using an enzymatic colorimetric method (Phospholipids B; Wako Chemicals) and absorbance at 280 nm in the presence of 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, respectively.NMR Measurements and Structure Calculations—One- and two-dimensional NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance-600 NMR system with a TCI CryoProbe and an Avance-500 NMR spectrometer at 37 °C. One-dimensional 31P experiments were run at 202.45 MHz on an Avance-500 spectrometer with sodium phosphate buffer as an external reference set at 0.0 ppm. 50-, 100-, 150-, and 200-ms mixing times were used in NOESY, and a 100-ms spin-lock time was used in total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) measurements. Two-dimensional data sets were collected with 2048 complex t2 points with 512 t1 increments. States-time-proportional phase incrementation was employed for frequency discrimination in the indirect dimension. Chemical shifts were referenced with respect to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (0.0 ppm) used as an internal standard. To improve spectrum resolution, additional spectra were obtained at 37 °C on a Varian Inova 900 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe. Data were acquired using conventional sequences from the Varian library. In all experiments, the spectral width was 14 kHz, and a 3919 watergate scheme was used to suppress water in all experiments. The two-dimensional TOCSY data set was collected with a 60-ms DIPSI spin-lock of 10 kHz strength and an acquisition time of 400 ms in t2 and 28 ms in t1. The NOESY data set was collected with the same general parameters and a mixing time of 200 ms. These parameters provided a digital resolution in F2 of 2.5 Hz/point prior to zero filling.The NMR data were transferred to a Silicon Graphics IRIS Indigo work station and processed using the program FELIX (version 2007) (Felix NMR Inc., San Diego, CA). NMR structures were calculated on a Silicon Graphics IRIS Indigo work station using X-PLOR (online) version 3.851. The structure calculation protocol involved (a) generation of a “template” coordinate set; (b) bound smoothing, full structure embedding, and regularization to produce a family of 100 distance geometry structures; (c) simulated annealing regularization and refinement for embedded distance geometry structures; and (d) simulated annealing refinement, as described previously (15Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Palgunachari M.N. Chaddha M. Sham S.W.S. Krishna N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Average coordinates of the accepted structures were energyminimized using 200 cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimization. All of the NMR constraints were enforced during energy minimization.Distance and Dihedral Angle Constraints—On the basis of cross-peak intensities in the NOESY spectra, recorded with mixing times of 100 and 200 ms, the NOE distance constraints were classified as follows. For NOEs involving intraresidue and sequential NH, ;H, and ;H protons, a distance constraint of 2.0-2.5 Á for strong, 2.0-3.0 Á for medium, and 2.0-4.0 Á for weak NOEs was used; for medium or long range NOEs involving NH and ;H protons, a distance constraint of 2.0-4.0 Á was used; for NOEs involving medium or long range side chain protons, a distance constraint of 2.0-5.0 Á was used. Pseudoatom corrections, where appropriate, were added to the upper distance bounds, as described previously (28Wuthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Based on the difference (Δ;) in the observed and “coil” NH proton chemical shifts, hydrogen bond (H-O) distances were calculated as described earlier (29Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). These hydrogen bond distances were included as additional constraints (30Gibbs A.C. Kondejewski L.H. Gronwald W. Nip A.M. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Wishart D.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) during structure calculation. Dihedral angles : and < were based on the difference in the observed and “coil” C;H proton chemical shifts (29Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol.

Fig. 3, A and B, show the amide/aromatic proton region and the fingerprint region, respectively, of the NOESY spectrum of 4F·DMPC complex obtained using a mixing time of 200 ms. TOCSY cross-peaks in Fig. 3A are shown in red. Sequential dNN(i, i + 1) NOESY cross-peaks for all of the residues in 4F are identified in Fig. 3A. In addition, dNN(i, i + 2) cross-peaks were observed for Asp1/Phe3, Phe3/Ala5, Phe6/Asp8, and Lys13/Lys15 pairs and are indicated in Fig. 3A. In Fig. 3B, intraresidue HN/C;H NOEs for all of the residues in 4F are labeled.

The methyl protons of the N terminus acetyl protecting group showed NOEs to Asp1, Trp2, Phe3, and Lys4 backbone NH protons as well as to the Trp2 aromatic ring protons (Fig. 3B). In addition, NOEs were observed between the aromatic ring protons of Trp2/Phe3 and Phe3/Tyr7 (Fig. 3A). NOEs between Trp2/Phe6 and Phe6/Tyr7 ring protons, although probably present, could not be assigned unambiguously because of resonance overlap. The observed (i, i + 1), (i, i + 2), (i, i + 3), and (i, i + 4) NOEs are schematically shown in Fig. 4. For the sequential NOEs, thickness of the line is in proportion to their intensity (Fig. 4).

Starting from a set of 100 initial extended structures of 4F, 70 structures were accepted based on the following criteria: (a) no NOE violations >0.5 Á, (b) no dihedral angle violations >5°, (c) root mean square (r.m.s.) difference for bond deviations from ideality <0.01 Á, and (d) r.m.s. difference for angle deviations from ideality <2°. To obtain the average NMR structure, average coordinates of the 70 accepted structures were energy-minimized. All of the distance and the dihedral angle constraints were enforced during the energy minimization of the average coordinates. The structural statistics for the 70 accepted NMR structures and the energy-minimized average structure of 4F are summarized in Table 1. The 70 accepted structures were superimposed onto the energy-minimized average structure using MATCH (Sybyl, version 7.2). The program MATCH performs an automatic least squares fit of two molecules that differ only in the coordinates of their atoms. Fig. 6 shows superposition of the C; atoms of all the 70 accepted structures on the energy-minimized average NMR structure of 4F.

We show here that activated RhoA, but not Rac1, is enriched in pseudopodia of MSV-MDCK-INV tumor cells and that Rho, Rho kinase (ROCK), and myosin II regulate the microtubule-independent targeting of RNA to these tumor cell domains. ROCK inhibition does not affect pseudopodial actin turnover but significantly reduces the dynamics of pseudopodial RNA turnover. Gene array analysis shows that 7.3% of the total genes analyzed exhibited a greater than 1.6-fold difference between the pseudopod and cell body fractions. Of these, only 13.2% (261 genes) are enriched in pseudopodia, suggesting that only a limited number of total cellular mRNAs are enriched in tumor cell protrusions. Comparison of the tumor pseudopod mRNA cohort and a cohort of mRNAs enriched in neuronal processes identified tumor pseudopod-specific signaling networks that were defined by expression of M-Ras and the Shp2 protein phosphatase. Pseudopod expression of M-Ras and Shp2 mRNA were diminished by ROCK inhibition linking pseudopodial Rho/ROCK activation to the localized expression of specific mRNAs. Pseudopodial enrichment for mRNAs involved in protein translation and signaling suggests that local mRNA translation regulates pseudopodial expression of less stable signaling molecules as well as the cellular machinery to translate these mRNAs. Pseudopodial Rho/ROCK activation may impact on tumor cell migration and metastasis by stimulating the pseudopodial translocation of mRNAs and thereby regulating the expression of local signaling cascades. mRNA trafficking and local protein translation are associated with protrusive cellular domains, such as neuronal growth cones, and deregulated control of protein translation is associated with tumor malignancy.

Regulation of mRNA translation through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and downstream eIF4E-binding protein and S6 kinases play key roles in tumorigenesis (1.Averous J. Proud C.G.

In particular, the initiation factor eIF4E induces tumorigenicity and has recently been effectively targeted to inhibit tumor growth (3.Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N.

In various nonmammalian and mammalian cell systems, mRNA localization is a driving force for cell polarization and a key mechanism in post-transcriptional gene regulation (5.St Johnston D. Nat. Rev.

Local translation in dendrites plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation via mechanisms that involve expression of the initiation factor eIF2, the elongation factor eEF2 or the Fragile X mental retardation RNA-binding protein (6.Sutton M.A. Taylor A.M.

Wyckoff J. Jones J. Singer R.H. Condeelis J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1202-1205PubMed Google Scholar). The demonstration that Src phosphorylation of ZBP1 results in the translational derepression of β-actin mRNA (19.Huttelmaier S. Zenklusen D. Lederer M. Dictenberg J. Lorenz M. Meng X. Bassell G.J.

Proteomic analysis has shown that the protein translation machinery, RNA-binding proteins, and signaling proteins, including ROCK and Src, are major components of tumor cell protrusions of MSV-MDCK-INV tumor cells (20.Jia Z. Barbier L. Stuart H. Amraei M. Pelech S. Dennis J.W. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P. Nabi I.R. J. Biol.

In this tumor cell line, pseudopodial protrusion is dependent on autocrine HGF activation and regulated by Rho/ROCK signaling (20.Jia Z. Barbier L. Stuart H. Amraei M. Pelech S. Dennis J.W.

Activated Rho has been localized to the protrusions of motile cells and shown to regulate pseudopodial RNA expression (23.Cardone R.A. Bagorda A. Bellizzi A. Busco G. Guerra L. Paradiso A.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). More recently, pseudopod-localized tyrosine-phosphorylated caveolin-1 (pCav1) has been shown to be a critical regulator of Rho activation state, focal adhesion turnover, and ROCK- and Src-dependent tumor cell migration and invasion (21.Joshi B. Strugnell S.S. Goetz J.G. Kojic L.D. Cox M.E. Gritffith O.L. Chan S.K. Jones S.J. Leung S.P. Masoudi H. Leung S. Wiseman S.M. Nabi I.R. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8210-8220Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). RhoA, and not Rac1, is shown here to be activated in the pseudopodia of MSV-MDCK-INV tumor cells. Dominant active Rac1 inhibits pseudopodial RhoA and ROCK inhibition activates pseudopodial Rac1. Like β-actin mRNA in fibroblasts (17.Latham J. Vaughan M. Yu E.H.S. Tullio A.N. Adelstein R.S. Singer R.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1010-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), RNA delivery to tumor cell protrusions is microtubule-independent, ROCK-dependent and myosin 2 (MLC2)-dependent. Pseudopodial actin turnover is not affected by ROCK inhibition that dramatically restricts dynamic RNA turnover in these domains. Competitive signaling between RhoA and Rac1 therefore regulates the dynamic delivery of RNA to protrusive cellular domains of tumor cells. Gene array analysis identifies mRNAs for signaling proteins and the translation machinery as predominant pseudopod-enriched mRNAs. Comparative analysis with neuronal process-enriched mRNA (14.Poon M.M. Choi S.H. Jamieson C.A. Geschwind D.H. Martin K.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13390-13399Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) identified M-Ras and Shp-2 as tumor cell-specific components of pseudopodial signaling networks. RhoA/ROCK activation may thereby impact on tumor cell migration by stimulating pseudopodial targeting of select mRNAs and altering the expression of signaling cascades in tumor cell protrusions. Antibodies, Plasmids, and Reagents—Anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody, Hoechst, nocodazole, and blebbistatin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-syntrophin monoclonal antibody was from Affinity Bioreagents, anti-HSP70 was from Upstate Technologies, and anti-fibronectin monoclonal antibody was from BD Sciences. Anti-M-Ras was a generous gift from Dr. J. Schroeder (University of British Columbia). Alexa 488-, 568-, and 647-conjugated secondary antibodies and the RNA-binding fluorescent dyes Syto RNASelect and Syto14 were purchased from Molecular Probes. Y27632 was from Calbiochem. Raichu FRET probes for activated RhoA and Rac1 were generously provided by Michiuki Matsuda (Osaka University) and dominant active V14RhoA plasmid by Nathalie Lamarche (McGill University). Cell Culture, Immunofluorescent Labeling, and Pseudopod Purification—MDCK, MSV-MDCK (DoCl1), and MSV-MDCK-INV cells were cultured as previously described (27.Le P.U. Nguyen T.N. Drolet-Savoie P. Leclerc N. Nabi I.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1631-1635PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Immunofluorescent labeling of methanol/acetone fixed cells was essentially as previously described (20.Jia Z. Barbier L. Stuart H. Amraei M. Pelech S. Dennis J.W. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P. Nabi I.R.

The cells were imaged on a FV1000 Olympus confocal microscope using 60× planapochromat objectives. Actin-rich pseudopodia were scored visually for SytoRNA labeling from images of three cells or more (>30 cells and three experiments/condition). Pseudopod Purification, Western Blots, and Activated Rho Pulldown—Pseudopodia purification and Western blots of pseudopodia, cell body, and total cell lysates were performed as previously described (20.Jia Z. Barbier L. Stuart H. Amraei M. Pelech S. Dennis J.W. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P. Nabi I.R. J. Biol.

Briefly, 107 MSV-MDCK-INV cells were plated on 100-mm 1-micron pore filters mounted between two 3–3.5-inch custom-made washers (Boulons Plus, Anjou, Canada) in a 100-mm Falcon Petri dish, and the exterior was sealed with agarose to prevent cell leakage to the bottom of the filter. After 24 h of culture, the filter was washed four times with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+, and the top (cell bodies) and bottom (pseudopodia) of the filter were scraped with a glass coverslip in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA containing freshly added 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2.5 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 μm leupeptin). GTP-RhoA pulldown assay was performed as described previously (21.Joshi B. Strugnell S.S. Goetz J.G. Kojic L.D. Cox M.E. Gritffith O.L. Chan S.K. Jones S.J. Leung S.P. Masoudi H. Leung S. Wiseman S.M. Nabi I.R. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8210-8220Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, 46 μl (∼30 μg) of Rho assay reagent (Rhotekin RBD, agarose; Upstate, CA) slurry was used to pull down active Rho from cell lysates prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. Both active and total RhoA samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-RhoA monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Affymetrix Gene Array—Biotinylated complimentary RNA was prepared from 100 ng of total RNA as per the Affymetrix GeneChip Technical Analysis Manual (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using the two-cycle target labeling assay. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized using SuperScriptII (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)24 primers. Biotin-labeled complimentary RNA was prepared by cDNA in vitro transcription using the BioArray high yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Biochem, New York, NY) incorporating biotinylated UTP and CTP. GeneChips were processed at the London Regional Genomics Centre (Robarts Research Institute, London, Canada). Six Affymetrix canine arrays (three pseudopodia, three cell body) were scanned with the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and signal intensities for genes generated with GCOS1.2 (Affymetrix) using the default values for statistical expression algorithm parameters, a target signal of 150 for all probe sets and a normalization value of 1. To determine the significant differences in gene expression levels between pseudopodia and cell body samples, one-way analysis of variance was performed using Partek Pro (St. Louis, MO). Significantly modulated genes were defined as those with absolute log2 fold change greater than 0.7. The genes were summarized together using hierarchical clustering by Z score-normalized data crossing all six samples. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE13253. Gene lists of mRNAs up-regulated in tumor protrusions and neuronal processes (supplemental Table S1) (14.Poon M.M. Choi S.H. Jamieson C.A. Geschwind D.H. Martin K.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13390-13399Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) were analyzed and compared using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—FRET experiments used single molecule RhoA (Raichu1298) and Rac1 (Raichu1026) activity sensing FRET plasmids (generically YFP-Rho GTPase-Rho GTPase effector-binding domain-CFP). GTP binding promotes interaction of the activated GTPase and the effector-binding domain bringing the N-terminal YFP and C-terminal CFP into proximity enabling FRET (29.Yoshizaki H. Ohba Y.

Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with Raichu1298, Raichu1026, or Raichu1298 and dominant active V12Rac1 plasmid in 4-well Lab-Tek II chambered coverglasses (Nalge Nunc International) for 24 h and treated with 20 μm Y27632 for 1 h prior to imaging in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. CFP and YFP emission of transfected cells excited with a 405-nm laser was first acquired on an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope, cell regions were bleached using a 515-nm laser, and the CFP and YFP channels were reimaged. The average pixel intensity of the selected region was determined before and after bleaching, and FRET efficiency was calculated in the CFP channel taking into account background pixel intensity. The percentage of bleach value was obtained by subtracting the average pixel intensity following bleaching from the average pixel intensity prior to bleaching. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—MSV-MDCK-INV cells stained with 400 nm Syto RNASelect for 1 h, transiently transfected with EGFP or MSV-MDCK-INV cells stably expressing EGFP-β-actin (20.Jia Z. Barbier L. Stuart H. Amraei M. Pelech S. Dennis J.W. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P. Nabi I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30564-30573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were plated in chambered cover-glasses for 24 h and incubated with 20 μm Y27632 for 1 h in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium prior to imaging for 90s following bleaching of select actin-rich pseudopodia using a 488-nm laser at 100%. In Situ Hybridization—Approximately 20,000 cells were plated per well in 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) for 24 h and, where indicated, treated with 20 μm Y27632 for 90 min. The cells were fixed, prehybridized, and hybridized with end tail DIG-labeled control or target specific oligonucleotides and immunodetected following the standard protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Subsequently, the cells were washed with 95% ethanol and mounted with gelvatol. To quantify the distribution of specific mRNAs, pseudopodia were defined as that portion of cellular protrusions beyond the point of narrowing, and the number of DIG immunoreactive profiles (spots) in pseudopodia and cell body was determined. RhoA/ROCK Signaling Regulates Pseudopodial RNA Delivery and Turnover—Raichu FRET reporter constructs for RhoA and Rac1 have been extensively used to localize the active forms of these GTPases (29.Yoshizaki H. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Itoh R.E. Nakamura T. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 30.Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). MSV-MDCK-INV cells were transfected with Raichu-Rho and Raichu-Rac and Rho and Rac activation, respectively, determined in the pseudopodia and cell bodies of the cells by photobleaching FRET (Fig. 1). RhoA activation is increased in pseudopodial regions compared with cell body regions, but no difference in Rac1 activation between these two regions of MSV-MDCK-INV cells was detected (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, in cells treated for 1 h with the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, we observed selective activation of Rac1 in pseudopodial regions. Conversely, expression of dominant active Rac1 inhibited pseudopodial RhoA activation (Fig. 1B). To verify Rho activation in pseudopodial domains, we purified the pseudopodia of MSV-MDCK-INV cells and assessed the presence of activated Rho using a rhotekinin pulldown assay (21.Joshi B. Strugnell S.S. Goetz J.G. Kojic L.D. Cox M.E. Gritffith O.L. Chan S.K. Jones S.J. Leung S.P. Masoudi H. Leung S. Wiseman S.M. Nabi I.R. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 8210-8220Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1C, activated Rho-GTP is enriched in the pseudopodial fraction of MSV-MDCK-INV cells purified on 1-micron pore filters (20.Jia Z. Barbier L. Stuart H. Amraei M. Pelech S. Dennis J.W. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P. Nabi I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30564-30573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) relative to the cell body. These results demonstrate a predominant role for RhoA signaling in MSV-MDCK-INV pseudopodia and are indicative of cross-talk between RhoA and Rac1 in this cellular domain. Generally, actin filaments and microtubules facilitate short and long distance mRNA transport, respectively (5.St Johnston D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Disruption of cytoplasmic microtubules by nocodazole treatment of MSV-MDCK-INV cells results in cell rounding and blebbing followed by cell spreading and reformation of pseudopodia (31.Jia Z. Vadnais J. Lu M. Noel J. Nabi I.R. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In these cells, Syto14-labeled RNA extends to peripheral cellular protrusions (Fig. 2A). Scoring of actin-rich pseudopodia for Syto14 labeling showed that microtubule depolymerization increased the number of RNA-containing pseudopodia (Fig. 2B). RNA labeling of protrusions was prevented by treatment with Y27632 or the MLC2 inhibitor blebbistatin in both the absence and the presence of nocodazole (Fig. 2). Global RNA delivery to MSV-MDCK-INV protrusions therefore occurs via a microtubule-independent, Rho/ROCK/MLC2-dependent mechanism. To further validate the effect of Rho/ROCK signaling on dynamic mRNA delivery to pseudopodial domains, we assessed turnover of pseudopodial actin and RNA using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. ROCK inhibition did not impact on turnover of pseudopodial β-actin-GFP turnover (Fig. 3, A and B). However, ROCK inhibition not only reduces pseudopodial RNA content (Fig. 2A) (20.Jia Z. Barbier L. Stuart H. Amraei M. Pelech S. Dennis J.W. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P. Nabi I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30564-30573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but also severely restricts the dynamics of the residual RNA present in these domains (Fig. 3, A and C). In the presence of the ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, the Syto14-labeled RNA showed a slower rate of recovery and a reduced mobile fraction (Fig. 3, A and C). Tumor Cell Pseudopodia Contain a Distinct Spectrum of mRNA—To characterize the transcriptome of MSV-MDCK-INV pseudopodia, we performed gene array analysis of pseudopodia isolated on 1-micron pore polycarbonate filters (20.Jia Z. Barbier L. Stuart H. Amraei M. Pelech S. Dennis J.W. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P. Nabi I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30564-30573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 28.Nguyen T.N. Wang H.J. Zalzal S. Nanci A. Nabi I.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Pseudopodial and cell body mRNA fractions were prepared and analyzed by Affymetrix microarray analysis. Of the 23,913 genes analyzed, only 1979 genes (7.3%) presented an absolute log2 fold change greater than 0.7 (∼1.6-fold) of mRNA expression in either the pseudopodial or cell body fraction with a minority (261; 13.2%) of mRNAs exhibiting increased expression in the pseudopodia relative to the cell body (Fig. 4A and supplemental Table S1). This is consistent with the idea that a select population of mRNAs is translocated to tumor cell pseudopodia. A cohort of 242 identified genes enriched 1.6-fold in the pseudopodial fraction is listed in Table 1 and functionally grouped. The number of genes/group is presented as a pie chart (Fig. 4B). Of particular interest is the abundance of proteins involved in signaling and protein translation. Indeed, a large number of pseudopod-enriched mRNAs encode ribosomal proteins (Table 1). Similarly, components of the translational machinery were among the most abundant mRNAs identified in a recent analysis of process-localized mRNAs in hippocampal neurons (14.Poon M.M. Choi S.H. Jamieson C.A. Geschwind D.H. Martin K.C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13390-13399Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Ingenuity network comparison of mRNAs enriched in neuronal protrusions compared with MSV-MDCK-INV pseudopodia revealed multiple common signaling pathways to be present in protrusions from normal neurons and cancer cells (Fig. 4C). However, a number of networks were identified to be selectively expressed in either tumor protrusions or neuronal processes indicative of the distinct mRNA composition of these two protrusive structures (Fig. 4C). Of particular interest, tumor protrusion networks were defined consistently by expression of mRNAs coding for M-Ras and Shp2 (PTPN11) that were not present in the neuronal process-enriched RNA cohort (supplemental Table S2).TABLE 1mRNAs enriched 1.6-fold in the pseudopodial fraction relative to cell body Open table in a new tab The Affymetrix data were validated by in situ hybridization of a select population of mRNAs including β-actin (1.4-fold up, log2 fold 0.49), Shp2 (Src homology 2 phosphotyrosyl phosphatase, PTPN11; 2.4-fold up, log2 fold 1.27), M-Ras (Ras small GTPase; 2.27-fold up, log2 fold 1.18), the p41 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex (ARPC1A, 1.84-fold up, log2 fold 0.88), and α-syntrophin (SNTA1, 1.78-fold up, log2 fold 0.83). β-Actin and Arp2/3 p41 subunit mRNA have been previously demonstrated to localize at or near membrane protrusions (17.Latham J.

Collagen IX is a heterotrimer composed of three different ;-chains, and all others are homotrimers whose ;-chains are characterized by short collagenous (COL) domains interrupted by several noncollagenous (NC) domains (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 33-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 2Ricard-Blum S. Ruggiero F. Pathol. Biol. 2005; 53: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Unlike the fibril-forming collagens, the FACITs have significantly shorter carboxyl-terminal NC domains (NC1 domains): 37 residues for collagen XIV, 20-25 residues for collagen IX, and even fewer than 20 residues for collagen types XII and XIX (based on human sequences). In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal NC domains of fibrillar collagens (C-propeptides) are of a different type and contain about 260 residues. The FACITs share a remarkable sequence homology at their COL1/NC1 junctions, each having two strictly conserved cysteine residues separated by four residues in their NC1 domain. Several studies suggest that the COL1 domain and the NC1 domain are involved in the mechanism of chain selection in the assembly of collagens XII and XIV (3Mazzorana M. Gruffat H.

Contrary to these studies, very recent studies on collagen IX show that three ;-chains can associate in the absence of the COL1 and NC1 domains to form a triple helix, although the COL2-NC2 region alone is not sufficient for trimerization (7Jáálinoja J. Ylóstalo J. Beckett W. Hulmes D.J.S. Ala-Kokko L. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This suggests that folding and chain selection of collagen IX is a cooperative process involving multiple COL and NC domains (7Jáálinoja J. Ylóstalo J. Beckett W. Hulmes D.J.S. Ala-Kokko L. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It has also been hypothesized that the NC2 domain of all FACIT collagens is able to form an ;-helical coiled-coil, thus bearing an ability to trimerize those collagens (8McAlinden A. Smith T.A.

Collagen XIX was identified from independently isolated clones from a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (9Yoshioka H. Zhang H. Ramirez F. Mattei M.G. Moradi-Ameli M. van der Rest M. Gordon M.K.

The type XIX chain is composed of a 268-residue, noncollagenous amino terminus, an 832-residue discontinuous collagenous region, and a 19-residue carboxyl-terminal peptide (10Myers J.C. Sun M.J.

It is by far the least abundant collagen so far purified, with a composition of ∼10-6% of the dry weight of umbilical cord (13Myers J.C. Li D. Amenta P.S. Clark C.C. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32047-32057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several features in the type XIX sequence place this collagen in the largest subclass of the nonfibrillar group, the FACIT collagens. These include a ∼250-residue thrombospondin module at the amino terminus, the position of two 2-amino acid interruptions in the collagenous subdomain closest to the carboxyl terminus, and a Cys-Xaa4-Cys motif situated at the junction of the collagenous region and carboxyl peptide (COL1/NC1 junction) (11Inoguchi K.

Characterization of mice harboring null or structural mutations in the collagen XIX (Col19a1) gene has revealed the critical contribution of this matrix protein to muscle physiology and differentiation (14Sumiyoshi H. Mor N. Lee S.Y. Doty S. Henderson S. Tanaka S. Yoshioka H. Rattan S. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The phenotype includes smooth muscle motor dysfunction and a hypertensive sphincter. Mice without collagen XIX also display impaired smooth-to-skeletal muscle cell conversion in the abdominal segment of the esophagus (14Sumiyoshi H. Mor N. Lee S.Y. Doty S. Henderson S. Tanaka S. Yoshioka H. Rattan S. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Electron microscope images of protein purified from human umbilical cord revealed a sharply kinked and highly polymorphic collagenous region as well as higher order complexes (13Myers J.C. Li D.

The higher order complexes involve the aminoterminal domain, which is responsible for intermolecular disulfide linkages and contains a heparin-binding site (13Myers J.C. Li D. Amenta P.S. Clark C.C. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32047-32057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To explore the trimerization abilities of collagen XIX at the biophysical level, we have studied the NC1 and NC2 domains in their isolated form as well as in conjunction with a triple helix. We show that the folding and the interchain disulfide bridge formation in the NC1 domain is driven by the triple helix formation; in other words, the triple helix formation in the COL1 domain is necessary for the folding of the NC1 domain. The artificial triple helical sequence (GPO)6, which forms a triple helix by itself, efficiently induces the folding of the NC1 domain. The NC2 domain alone is an effective trimerization domain. It forms a stable trimer and substantially stabilizes the triple helical domains attached to it. Synthesis and Purification of Reduced NC1-containing Peptides—Peptides with the NC1 domain were synthesized using the native sequence of mouse collagen XIX from the Swiss Protein Data base (Swiss-Prot number Q0VF58). The peptides were synthesized on an ABI433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) with 0.25 mm Fmoc-Gly-PEG-PS resin, a 4-fold excess of Fmoc-amino acids, and O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate as activating agent. The Fmoc-amino acids carried the protection groups Cys-Trt, Hyp-t-Bu, Gln-Trt, His-Trt, Ser-t-Bu, Glu-O-t-Bu, Arg-Pbf, Asn-Trt, and Tyr-t-Bu. The peptides were cleaved off of the resin and deprotected for 4 h at room temperature with 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% thioanisole, 3% 1,2-ethanedithiol, 2% anisole. Subsequently, the peptides were precipitated in cold ether, redissolved in H2O, and lyophilized. The reduced peptides were then purified by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column (50 × 250 mm, 10-15-;m particle size, 300-Á pores; Vydac, Hesperia, CA) with an acetonitrile/water gradient and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as an ion-pairing agent. Finally, the peptides were characterized by electrospray/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-Tof micro, Waters Associates). Oxidation of NC1-containing Peptides and Separation of Oligomers—The lyophilized, reduced peptides were dissolved in degassed and N2-saturated 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, under N2 atmosphere and were kept at 4 °C for 24 h in order to allow triple helix formation prior to oxidation. Oxidation was induced by the addition of reduced (10 mm) and oxidized (1 mm) glutathione and exposure to atmospheric O2. The pH was raised to 8.3 with a saturated solution of Tris. Oxidation was carried out for 5-7 days, and the peptide mass was periodically analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. To separate covalently linked oligomers, the oxidized crude material was dissolved in deionized 8 m urea containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to prevent disulfide exchange and applied to a sieve column (BioSep-SEC-S 2000, 600 × 20 mm; Phenomenex). Fractions were characterized by electrospray/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Trimer-containing fractions were pooled and further purified by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column with an acetonitrile/water gradient and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of NC2, (GPP)10NC2, and NC2(GPP)10—To facilitate expression and folding of short peptides containing the NC2 domain of human collagen XIX, they were cloned as part of fusion molecules with a His-tagged minifibritin that has a thrombin cleavage site (HT-mf-thr). Minifibritin is an obligatory trimer with both its amino and carboxyl termini exposed to solvent. The modified version of minifibritin (HT-mf-thr) has recently been used to successfully express, initiate folding, and stabilize a set of collagen fragments (15Bachmann A. Kiefhaber T. Boudko S.

Biol. 2004; 335: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The plasmid pET23-HisMf (17Boudko S.P. Kuhn R.J. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) has multiple cloning sites just after the HT-mf-thr gene. The plasmid (clone ID 8322416, NCBI accession number BC113364), containing the full-length human collagen XIX cDNA was purchased from Open Biosystems. The NC2 domain was PCR-amplified using two oligonucleotides: 5′-TGCAGATCTCCGGCTGATGCAGTTTCATTTGAA-3′ (forward primer fNC2; the BglII site is underlined) and 5′-GTCAGTCGACTTAGCCATAAGCTTGGGCAGCCAACATT-3′ (reverse primer rNC2; the SalI site is underlined). Two other constructs for (GPP10)NC2 and NC2(GPP)10 were PCR-amplified in two steps. The DNA fragment coding (GPP10)NC2 was prepared as follows. A synthetic oligonucleotide coding for (GPP)10 (5′-GGTCCGCCTGGCCCACCGGGCCCGCCCGGTCCGCCGGGCCCGCCGGGTCCCCCAGGTCCGCCCGGCCCGCCGGGCCCTCCGGGTCCACCG-3′) was used as a template to amplify the (GPP)10 part, including a complementary end for the NC2 domain, using two oligonucleotides, 5′-TCAGGATCCGGTCCGCCTGGCCCACCGGGC-3′ (forward primer fGPP; the BamHI cloning site is underlined) and 5′-TTCAAATGAAACTGCATCAGCCGGAATCCCGGGTGGACCCGGAGGGCCCGGC-3′ (reversed primer; one half of it is complementary to the end of (GPP)10, and the other half is complementary to the beginning of the NC2 domain). The product of this PCR was purified and used together with the plasmid containing the NC2 domain sequence as a complex annealed template to PCR-amplify the (GPP10)NC2 fragment using two oligonucleotides: fGPP and rNC2. The same strategy was applied to amplify the fragment NC2(GPP)10, using the following primers: 5′-GTTGGCTGCCCAAGCTTATGGGCGGCCGGGTCCGCCTGGCCCACCGGGC-3′ (forward primer; one half of it is complementary to the end of NC2 domain, and the other half is complementary to the beginning of (GPP)10) and 5′-GTCAGTCGACTTACGGTGGACCCGGAGGGCCCGG-3′ (reverse primer rGPP; the SalI site is underlined) for the first step and fNC2 and rGPP for the second step. The PCR-amplified fragments NC2, (GPP)10NC2, and NC2(GPP)10 were cut by BglII/BamHI and SalI and cloned into the pET23-HisMf vector using the restriction sites BamHI and SalI, so that all three fragments were a part of the fusion encoding the His6 tag, minifibritin, the flexible linker with the thrombin cleavage site, and the insert. The DNA inserts were verified by Sanger dideoxy DNA sequencing. The recombinant proteins were expressed at 30 °C in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) host strain (Novagen) after isopropyl 1-thio-;-d-galactopyranoside induction (final concentration 1 mm) for 12 h. Purification of the His6-tagged fusion proteins by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on a HisTrap™ HP column (Amersham Biosciences) and separation of the fragments NC2, (GPP)10NC2, and NC2(GPP)10 after thrombin cleavage were carried out as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Thrombin cleavage was performed at 4 °C for 24 h with thrombin protease (ICN) in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.3, containing 150 mm NaCl. The resulting fragments had two additional amino acid residues, GS, before the native amino acid sequence. The peptides were then purified by reversed phase HPLC using a C18 column with an acetonitrile/water gradient and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as an ion-pairing agent. The peptides eluted at a ∼60% acetonitrile concentration, which is highly denaturing. Finally, the peptides were characterized by electrospray/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed on a Beckman model XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Absorbance was measured at 240 nm. Runs were carried out at 20 °C in an An60-Ti rotor using 12-mm cells with Epon two-channel centerpieces. Circular Dichroism Analysis—CD spectra were recorded on an AVIV model 202 spectropolarimeter (AVIV Instruments, Inc.) with thermostatted quartz cells of 0.1-1-mm path length. The spectra were normalized for concentration and path length to obtain the mean molar residue ellipticity after subtraction of the buffer contribution. Thermal scanning curves were recorded at 222 nm for the NC2 peptide to monitor the ;-helical secondary structure transition and at 230 nm for (GPP)10NC2 and NC2(GPP)10 to monitor the collagen triple helix transition. Peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Evaluation of the Thermodynamic Data—CD transition curves were interpreted based on a two-state mechanism in which three unfolded chains, u, cross-linked by the NC2 domain, combine to a native collagen triple helix, n: u ↔ n. The equilibrium constant Ku is as follows, Ku = Cu/Cn = Fu/(1 − Fu) (Eq. 1) where cu and cn are concentrations of unfolded and native species, and Fu is the fraction of unfolded species, where Δn and Δu are the extrapolated native and unfolded ellipticities in the transition region and Δ is the observed ellipticity at the given temperature. From Equation 3, ΔGu = −RTInKu = ΔH0 − TΔS0 (Eq. 3) and Equation 1, assuming that ΔH0 and ΔS0 are constant, the linear fit of -RTlnKu versus T allowed us to determine the standard enthalpy, ΔH0, and the standard entropy, ΔS0. Sequences of the NC1 and NC2 Domains of FACIT Collagens—All FACIT collagens except human type XX have at least two collagenous domains, COL1 and COL2, and two noncollagenous domains, NC1 and NC2 (Fig. 1), where the NC2 domain is positioned between COL2 and COL1. Sequence analysis shows no significant sequence homology either among NC1 or NC2 domains, with the exception of the cysteine pattern at the junction between COL1 and NC1. The length of the NC1 domain varies from 19 to 37 residues (collagens XII/XIX and XIV, respectively), assuming that the first cysteine in the conserved cysteine pattern belongs to COL1. The length of NC2 domains, including one GXY triplet on both ends, varies from 37 to 50 residues (Fig. 1). Folding and Oxidation of the NC1 Domain—Formation of covalently cross-linked trimers is chosen as an indicator of the correct folding of the NC1 domain. To test the ability of the NC1 domain alone to form a covalently linked trimer, we oxidized the NC1 peptide (Table 1). Mass spectrometry analysis of oxidation products revealed the presence of only two peaks corresponding to a monomer and a dimer. Those products were separated on a sieve column under denaturing conditions. Two prominent peaks (Fig. 2A) were determined to be the dimer and the monomer by mass spectrometry. No trimer was detected.TABLE 1Amino acid sequences of peptides used in this study Open table in a new tab The h1NC1 peptide (Table 1) contains the last uninterrupted segment of the collagenous domain and the full-length NC1 domain. The length of this helix appeared insufficient to form a triple helix by itself at 4 °C, since no thermal transition was monitored by CD. The oxidation at 4 °C produced only monomers and dimers, as in the case with the NC1 peptide. Interestingly, the oxidation experiments of the h1NC1 peptide performed at -20 °C in the presence of 30% methanol to avoid freezing as described in Ref. 5Lesage A. Penin F. Geourjon C. Marion D. van der Rest M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9647-9660Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar were more successful. In addition to monomeric and dimeric oxidative forms, a small fraction (∼15-20%) of a trimer was formed (Fig. 2B). The purified trimeric form showed the formation of a moderately stable collagen triple helix (Table 2). This led us to the idea that the collagen triple helix formation might be a prerequisite for the correct folding and oxidation of the NC1 domain. Indeed, the addition of two GPO triplets to the beginning of the h1NC1 peptide dramatically changed the efficiency of the NC1 domain oxidative folding. The reduced (GPO)2h1NC1 peptide showed collagen triple helix formation (Table 2), and the consequent oxidation produced about 90% of the correctly oxidized trimeric product (Fig. 2C).TABLE 2Summary of biophysical data of the NC1-containing peptidesNumber of residuesMass (calc.)Mass (reduced)Mass (oxidized)Tm (reduced)Tm (oxidized)DaDaDa°C°CNC1282844.12843.02842.0 + 5685.5NANAh1NC1403908.23908.53907.5 + 7813.5 + 11,718.5ND29(GPO)2h1NC1464442.84442.513,319.01945(GPO)6NC1434180.64180.012,538.52672(GPO)6NC1Δ333182.43181.59540.52767 Open table in a new tab To analyze the importance of the triple helical sequence composition on the trimer formation, we substituted the native sequence with (GPO)6 (Table 1, peptide (GPO)6NC1), which is known to form a stable triple helix. The yield of the correctly oxidized product of the (GPO)6NC1 peptide was even slightly higher (data not shown). Thus, the oxidative folding of the NC1 domain does not depend on the composition of the triple helical sequence. The sequence of the NC1 domain is rather short, being only 19 amino acids long. To test its importance on oxidative folding, we synthesized a peptide, (GPO)6NC1Δ, where the last 10 residues of the NC1 domain are deleted (Table 1). The yield of the correctly oxidized trimer was the same as for the (GPO)6NC1 peptide. The comparison of the triple helix stability in the oxidized form of the two peptides shows a difference of 5 °C (Table 2). Thus, the missing part of the NC1 domain might be important for additional stabilization of the triple helix, either via a direct interaction of the missing part with the triple helix or by sterically restricting the dynamics of the disulfide knot. Trimeric Structure of the NC2 Domain—Fig. 3A shows an SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the expressed NC2 domain, (GPP)10NC2 and NC2(GPP)10. The far ultraviolet CD spectrum shows that the NC2 domain has predominantly an ;-helical structure (Fig. 3B) at 20 °C. The oligomeric state of the NC2 domain was investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation. Sedimentation equilibrium runs revealed a molecular mass of 15.7 ± 3.0 kDa, which is consistent with a trimeric structure (calculated molecular mass of the single chain is 5.3 kDa) (Table 3). Thermal transition curves monitored at 222 nm showed that the NC2 domain forms a highly stable structure that requires a substantial concentration of guanidine hydrochloride for thermal unfolding (Fig. 4). The reversibility of unfolding is shown by the gain of the signal upon reverse temperature scanning of the NC2 domain in a buffer supplemented with 3 m guanidine hydrochloride. Without the denaturant, the ;-helical structure was stable up to 90 °C.TABLE 3Summary of biophysical data of the NC2-containing peptidesMassAUCTmΔH0ΔS0kDakDa°CkJ mol−1J mol−1 K−1NC25.315.7 ± 3.0NANANA(GPP)10NC28.022.1 ± 4.368−501.4 ± 4.7−1470 ± 12NC2 (GPP)108.126.6 ± 4.755−392.4 ± 3.9−1196 ± 12 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Thermal transition curves of the NC2 domain.

The midpoint transition temperature (Tm) for (PPG)10 is a concentration-dependent value and is about 25 °C at 1 mg/ml concentration in phosphate-buffered saline (18Frank S. Boudko S. Mizuno K.

It has been previously shown that the Tm value of (GPP)10 can be sufficiently increased by fusion to an obligatory stable trimer (19Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R.

Stabilization of the (GPP)10 triple helix by forcing trimerization is possible from both amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends, although the effectiveness is highly varied (18Frank S. Boudko S. Mizuno K. Schulthess T. Engel J. Báchinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7747-7750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Far ultraviolet CD spectra of both (GPP)10NC2 and NC2(GPP)10 are similar in shape and deviate significantly from the CD spectrum of the isolated NC2 domain (Fig. 3B). Equimolar subtraction of the NC2 domain spectrum from either (GPP)10NC2 or NC2(GPP)10 and subsequent adjustment of the mean molar ellipticity demonstrates the presence of the collagen triple helical structure in both peptides (Fig. 3C). The (GPP)10 part in the (GPP)10NC2 peptide has higher content of triple helix then in NC2(GPP)10. Thermal transition curves monitored at 230 nm, at which the collagen triple helix transitions can be observed, show a substantial stabilization of the triple helix in both cases (Fig. 5). The Tm values are 68 and 55 °C for (GPP)10NC2 and NC2(GPP)10, respectively. The thermal range of the triple helical transitions is below the melting point of the NC2 domain (Fig. 5A); thus, the chains remain associated by the NC2 domain. The difference in the Tm values also correlates with the difference in the extent of the triple helical content. Both heating and cooling transition curves are shown to demonstrate a known effect of hysteresis observed for collagen transitions (16Boudko S.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Engel J. Báchinger H.P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Unfolding of the collagen triple helices observed in both peptides should be considered as a monomolecular reaction, since three chains remain linked by the NC2 domain. A thermodynamic analysis of the transitions shows that the absolute values of ΔH0 and ΔS0 are smaller for the NC2(GPP)10 peptide compared with the (GPP)10NC2 peptide (Fig. 5B and Table 3). Oxidative refolding experiments performed on the peptides containing the NC1 domain (Table 1) of collagen XIX demonstrate that a stable triple helical region is absolutely required for the correct disulfide knot formation in the junction region between the COL1 and NC1 domains. The full-length NC1 domain together with the preceding 9 residues of the COL1 domain is not capable of trimerization and disulfide knot formation. The presence of a sequence that can form a stable collagen triple helix is enough to initiate disulfide knot formation. The nature of the amino acid sequence in the triple helix is not important for disulfide knot formation; indeed, the natural sequence can be successfully substituted with the artificial (GPO)6 sequence. Furthermore, the deletion of the carboxyl-terminal half of the NC1 domain sequence has no effect on the yield of the correctly oxidized trimers. The same features are observed in the collagen III carboxyl-terminal disulfide knot (16Boudko S.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Mechling D.E. Báchinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14532-14536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The presence of the correctly formed disulfide knot significantly increases the thermal transition temperature of the collagen triple helix. This is very important for all FACIT collagens, since the carboxyl-terminal collagenous region COL1 has a number of interruptions that should significantly destabilize the triple helix. The presence of the disulfide knot just at the end of the last collagen domain serves as a covalent clamp preventing the carboxyl-terminal end of the collagen triple helix from “breathing” or “fraying.” The NC2 domain alone forms a highly stable trimer with a Tm value higher than 90 °C under physiological conditions. This is the first time that the trimerization abilities of the NC2 domain were demonstrated experimentally. The NC2 domain has an ;-helical structure and might adopt a coiled-coil structure, as suggested by McAlinden et al. (8McAlinden A. Smith T.A. Sandell L.J. Ficheux D. Parry D.A.D. Hulmes D.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42200-42207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Coiled-coils are versatile motifs that can form a variety of different oligomeric states, including parallel and anti parallel arrangements of chains (24Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Coiled-coil proteins contain a characteristic seven-residue sequence repeat whose positions are designated a to g. The interacting surface between ;-helices in a classical coiled-coil is formed by interspersing nonpolar side chains at the a and d positions with hydrophilic residues at the flanking e and g positions (25Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The heptad repeat patterns in the NC2 domains of FACIT collagens have interruptions and unusual distribution of apolar and polar residues (8McAlinden A. Smith T.A. Sandell L.J. Ficheux D. Parry D.A.D. Hulmes D.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42200-42207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The NC2 domain is located between two adjacent collagenous domains, and its structure might resemble the staggered conformation of triple helices. Thus, the unusual heptad repeat pattern might be a way to form a staggered coiled-coil. There are a few known examples of natural and designed ;-helical parallel coiled-coils having four or seven chains with shifted register (26Deng Y. Liu J. Zheng Q. Yong W. Lu M. Structure. 2006; 14: 889-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Liu J. Zheng Q. Deng Y. Cheng C. Kallenbach N.R. Lu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15224-15231Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), although none of them would resemble the collagen triple-helical staggered packing. Mapping of NC2 residues on a theoretical ;-helical wheel shows preferential distribution of polar side chains on one side that could possibly interact with two other chains to form a hydrophobic core. The trimerization properties and stabilization of the collagen triple helix on either end of the NC2 domain suggests a universal role for this domain in chain selection, chain registration, and initiation of the triple helix formation in all FACIT collagens. This is somewhat in contradiction with studies on collagen IX, where others believe that the COL2-NC2 region alone is not sufficient for trimerization (7Jáálinoja J. Ylóstalo J. Beckett W. Hulmes D.J.S. Ala-Kokko L. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Although this might reflect a different role of the NC2 domain in type IX collagen, a more detailed analysis is required. In future studies, we will investigate if the NC2 domain of type IX collagen is responsible for chain selection of the only heterotrimeric FACIT collagen. Since no mutations are described in NC2 domains of FACITs, it remains to be elucidated what residues are important for folding, stability, and especially for chain selection. To verify the proposed staggered conformation of the NC2 domain, the determination of an atomic structure by x-ray crystallography or NMR is required. We thank Lynn Sakai for motivation to study the NC1 domain of mouse collagen XIX and Kerry Maddox, Jessica Hacker, and Jesse Vance for peptide synthesis, peptide purification, mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis, and DNA sequencing."

ORC serves as a landing pad for recruitment of downstream replication-initiation proteins like Noc3p, Cdc6p, Cdt1p, and Mcm2–7p, forming a prereplicative complex (3Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev.

ORC localizes in telomere repeats, and depletion of ORC leads to dysfunctional telomeres (9Deng Z. Dheekollu J. Broccoli D. Dutta A. Lieberman P.M. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1989-1995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the N-terminal part of Orc1p recruits the chromatin silencing protein Sir1p (10Hou Z.G. Bernstein D.A. Fox C.A. Keck J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8489-8494Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ORC is responsible for positioning nucleosomes at ARS1 (11Lipford J.R. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 21-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and recent work has elucidated a physical interaction between ORC and histone acetyltransferase (Hat1p and Hat2p) (12Suter B. Pogoutse O. Guo X. Krogan N. Lewis P. Greenblatt J.F. Rine J. Emili A. BMC Biol. 2007; 5: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, ORC is enriched at heterochromatin regions and interacts directly with HP1, a key component of heterochromatin (13Pak D.T.S. Pflumm M. Chesnokov I. Huang D.W. Kellum R. Marr J. Romanowski P. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 311-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in ORC2 result in mislocalization of HP1. The interaction between ORC and HP1 is also identified in Xenopus and mammalian cells. In human cells, small interfering RNA knockdown of ORC2 leads to delocalization of HP1 and chromosome condensation defects (14Prasanth S.G. Prasanth K.V. Siddiqui K. Spector D.L. Stillman B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2651-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). An interesting physical interaction has also been revealed between Orc1p and Hbo1p, a histone acetyltransferase (15Iizuka M. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23027-23034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 16Burke T.W. Cook J.G. Asano M. Nevins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15397-15408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, it has never been explored whether ORC has any function in histone methylation. In budding yeast, histone 3 lysine residues 4, 36, and 79 are methylated by Set1p (KMT2), Set2p (KMT3), and Dot1p (KMT4), respectively (17Shilatifard A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Each modified lysine has three forms: mono-, di-, and trimethylation. The Set1 complex, or COMPASS (complex associated with Set1), is composed of Set1p, Bre2p (Cps60p), Swd1p (Cps50p or Saf 49p), Swd2p (Cps35p or Saf 37p), Swd3p (Cps30p or Saf 35p), Spp1p (Cps40p or Saf41p), Shg1p (Cps15p), and Sdc1p (Cps25p or Saf19p) (18Roguev A.

Set1p, Swd1p, and Swd3p are required for any H3K4 methylation, Bre2p and Sdc1p are not essential for, but contribute to, mono-, di-, and trimethylation, and Spp1p is only important for trimethylation (22Dehe P.M.

From a genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screen to identify human proteins that interact with human DNA replication-initiation proteins, we found that hCGBP (CpG island-binding protein) physically interacts with several DNA replication-initiation proteins including ORC. 3L. Zou, J. Kan, and C. Liang, unpublished results. Because budding yeast is a more amendable system for genetic and functional studies, we set out to investigate whether Spp1p, the yeast homolog of hCGBP, interacts with budding yeast replication-initiation proteins. Indeed, we find a physical interaction between Spp1p and Orc2p. Here, we report that ORC mediates histone methylation through cooperation with Spp1p. Plasmids, Strains, and Antibodies—The primers used to construct pGBKT7-SPP1 were 5′-GGAATTCATGTCATTACCACAATGGTGTCC-3′ (containing an EcoRI site) and 5′-GCGGATCCTTACAAACCTCTTCTTAAAATTTC-3′ (containing a BamHI site). The spp1Δ strain was generated in W303-1a by PCR-mediated one-step disruption using forward primer 5′-ATTTGGAAAAGGCTACTTCGACCTCAATAATTTCTCAGCCTATCTTTCTACGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGAAGTATATATATATGTAGAAACTGATATTTGATTAGGCTCCAACGCCGGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC-3′. The SPP1-HA-tagged strain was constructed using forward primer 5′-AAAAGCAACTAAATATACAATACTATGAGGAAATTTTAAGAAGAGGTTTGCGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3′ and the same reverse primer as for SPP1 deletion. The ORC2-TAP strain is provided by Andrew Emili (University of Toronto). The anti-histone 3, anti-dimethylated, and trimethylated H3K4 antibodies were purchased from AbCam (ab1791, ab7766, and ab8580, respectively). The anti-HA (12CA5) is from Roche Applied Science. Anti-ORC antibodies are from Bruce Stillman (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The yeast two-hybrid system employed was the MATCHMAKER GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech), and the assay was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-IP Assay—Co-IP assay was performed as described previously (33Zhang Y.X. Yu Z.L. Fu X.R. Liang C. Cell. 2002; 109: 849-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with modifications. In brief, 100 ml of log phase cells (A600 ∼ 2) were harvested for each sample, and total protein extracts were obtained by bead-beating in 400 μl of IP/lysis buffer-100 (100 mm (NH4)2SO4; other components as in Ref. 33Zhang Y.X. Yu Z.L. Fu X.R. Liang C. Cell. 2002; 109: 849-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After harvesting the extract, the pellet was extracted again with 400 μl of the IP/lysis buffer-200 (200 mm (NH4)2SO4 containing 200 μg/ml ethidium bromide; other components as in Ref. 33Zhang Y.X. Yu Z.L. Fu X.R. Liang C. Cell. 2002; 109: 849-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After the extract was harvested, the pellet was rinsed with 400 μl of IP/lysis buffer-0 (no (NH4)2SO4; other components as in Ref. 33Zhang Y.X. Yu Z.L. Fu X.R. Liang C. Cell. 2002; 109: 849-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The three extracts were combined as total protein extract for co-IP. Some 25 μl of protein G beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were added to preclear the protein extract at 4 °C for 1 h. Afterward, the samples were incubated with 5–10 μg of antibody or control mouse IgG (Pierce) for 1–1.5 h and then with 25 μl of protein G beads for 1 h. After extensive wash with IP/lysis buffer-100 (100 mm (NH4)2SO4), the beads were boiled in 25 μl of 2× Laemmli's buffer for 3 min. Chromatin Binding Assay—A chromatin binding assay to separate total yeast proteins into the crude chromatin pellet and supernatant fractions and the stringent chromatin binding assay involving the use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to partially digest the crude chromatin followed by ultracentrifugation to pellet the released chromatin were performed essentially as described previously (34Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Co-IP with MNase-digested Chromatin Fraction—The crude chromatin pellet isolated using the chromatin binding assay was digested with 1000 IU of MNase in 300 μl of MNase buffer (1 mm boric acid; 5 mm NaCl; 5 mm CaCl2; adjusted to pH 8.8) at 37 °C for 10 min. (It was confirmed that the resultant DNA fragments were less than 200 bp.) The supernatant was adjusted to standard IP/lysis buffer, and the co-IP assay was performed as described above. Cell Synchronization and FACS—Cells were arrested in G1 phase with 5 μg/ml α factor for 2.5–3 h and then released into fresh YPD medium. Cells were harvested at various time points, and FACS analysis was performed as described (33Zhang Y.X. Yu Z.L. Fu X.R. Liang C. Cell. 2002; 109: 849-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Spp1p Interacts with ORC through Orc2p—We performed yeast two-hybrid assays using SPP1 as the bait to test its possible interactions with replication-initiation proteins. We co-transformed the host AH109 cells with pGBKT7-SPP1 (SPP1 constructed in the DNA binding domain vector pGBKT7) and individual plasmids expressing replication-initiation proteins in the activation domain pGADT7 vector. The transformants were streaked on SCM-2 (synthetic complete medium, lacking leucine and tryptophan), SCM-3 (lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine), and SCM-4 (lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine) plates. We found that cells containing pGBKT7-SPP1 and pGADT7-ORC2, and those containing the positive control plasmids (pGBKT7-ORC3 with pGADT7-ORC2, and pGBKT7-p53 with pGADT7-T antigen) were able to grow on both SCM-3 and SCM-4 plates (Fig. 1A). The negative control strains containing pGBKT7-SPP1 and the pGADT7 vector, or the pGBKT7 vector and pGADT7-ORC2, could not grow on SCM-3 or SCM-4 plates (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that Spp1p interacts with Orc2p. The cells co-transformed with pGBKT7-SPP1, and individual plasmids expressing other replication-initiation proteins (Orc1p, 3p-6p, Noc3p, Cdc6p, Mcm2p-7p, Cdc45p) or Lamin C in pGADT7 could not grow on SCM-3 or SCM-4 plates (data not shown). These data suggest that there is a specific physical interaction between Spp1p and Orc2p. The interaction between Spp1p and Orc2p in the yeast two-hybrid system was confirmed by a co-immunoprecipitation assay using yeast protein extracts expressing the two-hybrid proteins (data not shown). To test the interaction between the endogenous Orc2p and Spp1p, we performed reciprocal co-IP assays using protein extracts from SPP1-HA-tagged yeast cells. Spp1p-HA was immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were probed by anti-Orc2 and -Orc3 antibodies. Orc2p and Orc3p could be co-immunoprecipitated with Spp1p (Fig. 1B, lane 5), whereas no signal was detected in the control mouse IgG pellet (lane 4) or untagged strain control (lane 2). In the reverse co-IP, we detected Spp1p-HA in the precipitates pulled down by anti-Orc2 antibody (Fig. 1C) and anti-ORC3 antibody (Fig. 1D). Together with the yeast two-hybrid data, the co-IP results strongly suggest that Spp1p physically interacts with ORC through Orc2p in vivo. Genetic interactions were also investigated between Spp1p and replication-initiation proteins or replication regulators. The SPP1 deletion has a synthetic sickness phenotype with orc2-1 and orc5-1, respectively, but not with mcm2-1, mcm3-1, mcm5-1, cdc6-1, cdc7-4, or cdc28-4 (data not shown), suggesting that ORC and Spp1p participate in a common pathway. ORC Interacts with Histone 3 When Histone 3 Lysine 4 Is Trimethylated—Spp1p is a component of the Set1 complex, which is responsible for methylation of H3K4. Having determined that ORC physically interacts with Spp1p, we examined whether ORC interacts with histone 3. The affinity precipitates from the ORC2-TAP strain were blotted by various antibodies (anti-Orc2, -Orc3, -Orc5, -Orc6, -H3, and -trimethylated H3K4). The results show that not only Orc3p, -5p, and -6p, but also H3 and trimethylated H3K4, associated with Orc2p (Fig. 1E, lane 4). None of them was detectable in the untagged control strain (Fig. 1E, lane 2). Correlating the recent work demonstrating a connection between ORC and histone acetyltransferase (12Suter B. Pogoutse O. Guo X. Krogan N. Lewis P. Greenblatt J.F. Rine J. Emili A. BMC Biol. 2007; 5: 38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), our data suggest that ORC may dynamically communicate with nucleosomes that contain an intricate combination of modifications. Because ORC and histone 3 are both chromatin-binding proteins, the co-IP of ORC with histone 3 might be bridged by DNA. To address this concern, we used ethidium bromide to release proteins from DNA in the co-IP assays described above. To further exclude the possibility of DNA/chromatin-mediated co-IP, we employed co-IP assay with proteins released from completely digested chromatin. The anti-Orc3 immunoprecipitates were blotted by anti-Orc3 and anti-trimethylated H3K4 antibodies (Fig. 1F). The trimethylated H3K4 was co-immunoprecipitated with Orc3p, lending support to the conclusion that the association of ORC with trimethylated H3K4 is through protein-protein interactions, which can occur on chromatin and can be maintained after the proteins have been released from chromatin. ORC and Spp1p Cooperate to Mediate Histone 3 Lysine 4 Trimethylation—To search for the functional significance of the associations among ORC, Spp1p, and histone 3, the H3K4 methylation pattern was analyzed in various strains (W303-1a, spp1Δ, orc2-1, and orc2-1, spp1Δ double mutants). Whole cell extracts from log phase cells were subject to immunoblotting with antibodies against different ORC subunits and di-, and trimethylated H3K4 (Fig. 2A). With SPP1 deletion, the trimethylation of H3K4 was reduced to a third at 25 °C, in line with previous results (22Dehe P.M. Dichtl B. Schaft D. Roguev A. Pamblanco M. Lebrun R. Rodriguez-Gil A. Mkandawire M. Landsberg K. Shevchenko A. Rosaleny L.E. Tordera V. Chavez S. Stewart A.F. Geli V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35404-35412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When SPP1 deletion was combined with orc2-1, the trimethylation of H3K4 was greatly reduced at 25 °C. At 37 °C, H3K4 trimethylation was mostly lost in spp1Δ and orc2-1 single mutants and completely abolished in the orc2-1, spp1Δ double mutant. Together with data showing the interactions among ORC, Spp1p, and histone 3, our results suggest that ORC and Spp1p cooperatively mediate H3K4 trimethylation. In addition, notice that dimethylation of H3K4 was also lowered in spp1Δ and orc2-1 single mutants at 37 but not 25 °C and in the double mutant at both 25 °C and 37 °C. Spp1p Is a Chromatin-binding Protein and Binds to Chromatin throughout the Cell Cycle—As a histone methylase, Spp1p together with other members of the Set1 complex should in principle bind to chromatin. We investigated the chromatin associations of Spp1p using the stringent chromatin binding assay (Fig. 2B) Similar to Orc3p, Spp1p is a chromatin-binding protein as it was detectable in low speed pellet, MNase supernatant, and high speed pellet fractions. To examine the chromatin binding pattern of Spp1p along the cell cycle, we harvested cells at different time points after they were released from α factor block and performed a chromatin binding assay (Fig. 2, C and D). Spp1p was found to bind chromatin constitutively throughout the cell cycle. Constant Binding of Di- and Trimethylated H3K4 to Chromatin along the Cell Cycle—As Orc2p and Spp1p bind chromatin throughout the cell cycle and cooperatively regulate the trimethylation of H3K4, it is worthwhile to examine the chromatin binding pattern of H3K4 trimethylation in the cell cycle. The W303-1a cells released from α factor were harvested at designated time points. The overall level of histone 3, dimethylated H3K4, and trimethylated H3K4 on chromatin was more-or-less constant in the cell cycle (Fig. 2, E and F). We have identified physical associations of ORC with Spp1p and histone 3 and revealed the functional role of ORC in H3K4 methylation in collaboration with the Set1 complex through Spp1p. The significance of the interactions may have implications in various cellular processes. Replication Origin Selection—An unsolved puzzle in DNA replication is how replication origins are selected. ORC in budding yeast is commonly thought to be directed to replication origins by the conserved ACS (1Bell S.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 659-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). From sequence analysis in the S. cerevisiae genome, the number of matches to ACS is overwhelmingly larger than de facto ORC binding sites and replication origins (5Wyrick J.J. Aparicio J.G. Chen T. Barnett J.D. Jennings E.G. Young R.A. Bell S.P. Aparicio O.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 35Xu W.H. Aparicio J.G. Aparicio O.M. Tavare S. BMC Genomics. 2006; 7: 1471-2164Google Scholar). Apparently, ACS is necessary but not sufficient for ORC binding. Additionally, biochemical studies suggest that the ability of ORC to distinguish specific from nonspecific sequences is limited (3Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). It has been widely speculated that ORC may recognize a unique chromatin structure, apart from ACS (3Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). The ORC-interacting Set1 complex may be one of the elusive epigenetic determinants of origin selection. How the interaction between ORC and Spp1p is modulated along the cell cycle and whether Spp1p is connected to replication origins are of instant interests and warrant further exploration. Functional Overlap of ORC and the Set1 Complex—The functions of ORC and the Set1 complex overlap in diverse cellular processes. The accumulated data on the cellular functions of the Set1 complex and ORC point to a surprising coincidence (2Sasaki T. Gilbert D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Dehe P.M. Geli V. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 536-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To summarize, they both participate in transcriptional regulation, heterochromatin formation, telomere and centromere functions (9Deng Z. Dheekollu J. Broccoli D. Dutta A. Lieberman P.M. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1989-1995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 36Wood A. Shilatifard A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and S phase checkpoint (37Corda Y. Schramke V. Longhese M.P. Smokvina T. Paciotti V. Brevet V. Gilson E. Geli V. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 38Schramke V. Neecke H. Brevet V. Corda Y. Lucchini G. Longhese M.P. Gilson E. Geli V.

The connections of the two protein complexes in these cellular activities need to be vigorously tested and will be a fertile area of future research. Regulation of H3K4 Trimethylation in the Cell Cycle—There is no discernible variation of the global level of ORC and trimethylated H3K4 on chromatin along the cell cycle. However, as the chromatin binding assay detects the overall level of chromatin association of proteins, it is possible that H3K4 trimethylation may be spatially regulated along the chromosomes in the cell cycle, and the association between ORC and Spp1p may occur at certain sites of chromosomes. Bearing in mind the genome-wide distribution of ORC, we postulate a spatial modulation of trimethylation of H3K4 regulated by ORC and Spp1p when they encounter each other on chromosomes, exerting epigenetic controls over a variety of cellular processes. We greatly appreciate the gift of mouse anti-ORC antibodies from Bruce Stillman (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) and ORC2-TAP strain from Andrew Emili (University of Toronto)."

We have previously characterized the first ligase, MurM (Lloyd, A. J., Gilbey, A. M., Blewett, A. M., De Pascale, G., El Zoeiby, A., Levesque, R. C., Catherwood, A. C., Tomasz, A., Bugg, T.

In order to characterize the second ligase MurN, we have developed a chemoenzymatic route to prepare the lipid II-Ala and lipid II-Ser substrates. Recombinant MurN enzymes from penicillin-resistant (159) and -sensitive (Pn16) S. pneumoniae were expressed and purified as MBP fusion proteins and reconstituted using a radiochemical assay. MurN ligases from strains 159 and Pn16 both showed a 20-fold higher catalytic efficiency for lipid II-l-Ala over lipid II-l-Ser, with no activity against unmodified lipid II, and similar kinetic parameters were measured for MurN from penicillin-resistant and penicillin-sensitive strains. These results concur with the peptidoglycan analysis of S. pneumoniae, in which the major cross-link observed is l-Ala-l-Ala. The combined action of ligases MurM and MurN is therefore required in order to rationalize the high level of dipeptide cross-links in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, with ligase MurM showing the major difference between penicillin-resistant and penicillin-sensitive strains.

The peptidoglycan layer of Streptococcus pneumoniae and other Gram-positive pathogens is cross-linked between Lys at position 3 of its pentapeptide side chain -l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala (2.Bugg T.D.

Some Gram-positive bacteria contain direct cross-links between l-lysine and d-alanine, but many Gram-positive bacteria contain a further peptide cross-link comprising one or more amino acids (3.Ghuysen J.M.

The addition of the amino acid residues of the cross-link is catalyzed by membrane-associated ligases, which utilize aminoacyl-tRNAs as substrates (7.Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M.

The genetic determinants of branched wall structure in S. pneumoniae are the murM and murN genes (14.Filipe S.R. Pinho M.G. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27768-27774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15.Filipe S.R. Severina E. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6798-6805Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). MurM catalyzes the addition of l-Ala or l-Ser, whereas the addition of the second l-Ala is catalyzed by MurN (16.Filipe S.R. Severina E. Tomasz A. Microb. Drug Resist. 2001; 7: 303-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). S. pneumoniae cell walls contain a mixture of directly linked (unbranched) and indirectly linked (branched) peptidoglycan, but the murMN genes are not essential, since direct cross-links can be formed (7.Bouhss A. Josseaume N. Allanic D. Crouvoisier M. Gutmann L. Mainardi J.L. Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. Arthur M. J.

However, these enzymes do have a role in the phenotype of penicillin resistance, since inactivation of murMN leads to a loss of penicillin resistance (16.Filipe S.R. Severina E. Tomasz A. Microb.

Clinical strains of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae require for the high level resistance phenotype 1) the presence of specific murMN sequences, responsible for dipeptide cross-link formation and 2) specific modified penicillin-binding protein sequences (16.Filipe S.R.

However, certain laboratory S. pneumoniae strains containing resistant murMN alleles do not show penicillin resistance, since they lack high affinity penicillin-binding proteins (35.Filipe S.R.

The markedly different branching phenotype displayed by S. pneumoniae Pn16 and 159 is rationalized in vitro by the much higher specific activity of MurM159 over MurMPn16 with pneumococcal alanyl-tRNAAla and the higher activity with alanyl-tRNAAla than with seryl-tRNASer (1.Lloyd A.J.

In order to better understand the molecular basis of penicillin resistance caused by MurM and MurN, we wished to kinetically characterize the second ligase MurN in two clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae, one highly penicillin-resistant (159) and the other penicillin-sensitive (Pn16). In order to reconstitute the MurN-catalyzed reaction, we have developed a chemoenzymatic method to prepare the aminoacyl-lipid II substrate for MurN, and we report the specificity of recombinant MurN for lipid II-Ala versus lipid II-Ser substrates.

Synthesis of UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide (l-Ala)—To 2 ml of 80% (v/v) acetonitrile in water were added 17.2 mg (90 μmol) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride, 6.9 mg (60 μmol) of N-hydroxysuccinimide, 1.9 mg (10 μmol) of N-(ethylsulfite)-morpholine, and 7.5 mg (24 μmol) of l-alanine-Fmoc.

The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 3 h, followed by the addition of 100 μl of ethanolamine and further incubated for 20 min before the addition of 100 μl of piperidine. After 30 min of incubation, 18 ml of H2O were added, and the solution was filtered with a nitrocellulose syringe filter (0.20-μm pore size).

Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of MurN from S. pneumoniae—The murN genes from S. pneumoniae Pn16 and 159 strains were cloned into the expression vector pBADM-41 to allow expression of MurN fused to a maltose-binding protein (MBP) 2The abbreviations used are: MBP, maltose-binding protein; EDC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propane sulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TEV, tobacco etch virus; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl. with N-terminal hexahistidine tag and C-terminal tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (27.Kapust R.B.

The same primers were designed to amplify both alleles (Table S1). The initial start codon of murN was absent in murN-Nco1 Fw primer, and the murN stop codon was present in the MBP-murN-Xho1 Rv primer. The murN genes were amplified from S. pneumoniae Pn16 and 159 genomic DNA using Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen). The primers and conditions are detailed in Table S1. Amplified products were purified, restricted with NcoI and XhoI, and ligated into similarly restricted pBADM-41 as described in Refs. 26.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Clones carrying the recombinant murN159 and murNPn16 genes were verified by sequencing, and one correct clone was retained for expression of each protein (pBADM-41::murN159 and pBADM-41::murNPn16). To overexpress the MurN proteins, 1-liter cultures of E. coli TB1, harboring either pBADM-41::murN159 or pBADM-41::murNPn16 in LB plus 50 μg/ml ampicillin were grown at 37 °C to A600 of 0.7, when murN expression was induced by 0.04% (w/v) l-arabinose. E. coli cells were harvested after 4 h, and the cell pellets were washed at 4 °C in 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The cells were lysed by sonication on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was then transferred in fresh tubes and centrifuged at 50,000 × g at 4 °C. The subcellular fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and MBP-MurN159 and MBP-MurNPn16 were present in the soluble fraction. N-His6-MBP-MurN159 and N-His6-MBP-MurNPn16 were purified from 50,000 × g supernatant by nickel-Sepharose affinity chromatography. 5 ml of prepacked nickel-Sepharose columns (GE Healthcare) were equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm imidazole (HEPES buffer A) and were loaded with soluble cell lysates. N-His6-MBP-MurN fusion proteins were then eluted isocratically by 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 500 mm imidazole. The collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Peak fractions were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C into 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. MBP-MurN159 and MBP-MurNPn16 were then further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Source 30Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was developed with a sodium chloride gradient between 25 mm and 1 m sodium chloride in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5% (v/v) glycerol using over 20 column volumes. Fractions containing MBP-MurN159 and MBP-MurNPn16 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. After two purification steps, the amount of MBP-MurN for a liter of culture was 5 mg/liter of culture for MBP-MurNPn16 and 4 mg/liter of culture for MBP-MurN159. TEV Protease Cleavage—To attempt cleavage of MurN from its MBP fusion protein, the TEV protease cleavage reaction was carried out overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm NaCl, 1mm MgCl2, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. A ratio of 1:25 TEV/MBP-MurN was used, usually 4 μg of TEV and 100 μg of MBP-MurN in 1 ml. The cleavage reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. MurN Radiochemical Assay—To follow the transfer of label from [3H]alanyl-tRNAAla and [3H]seryl-tRNASer to the peptidogylcan precursor, the assay mix was typically in a final volume of 30 μl routinely containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mml-alanine, lipid substrate (as indicated under “Results,” between 5 and 200 μm), MurN (as indicated under “Results,” between 5 and 50 nm). Reactions were initiated by (unless otherwise indicated) the addition of 0.45 μm [3H]alanyl-tRNAAla (prepared as reported in Ref. 1.Lloyd A.J. Gilbey A.M. Blewett A.M. De Pascale G. El Zoeiby A.

Reactions were terminated at the appropriate time by the addition of ice-cold 30 μl of 6 m pyridinium acetate, pH 4.5, and 60 μl of ice-cold n-butyl alcohol. The incubations were rapidly mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C at 13,000 × g, after which the n-butyl alcohol phase was washed with 70 μl of water and then assayed for [3H]scintillation counting in 5 ml of Optiphase scintillation mixture (HiSafe′ 2 from PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To follow generation of 3H-serylated lipid precursors, exactly the same procedure was followed, except that the 1 mm alanine and 0.45 μm [3H]alanyl-tRNAAla were replaced with 1 mm serine and 0.45 μm [3H]seryl-tRNASer (prepared as reported in Ref. 1.Lloyd A.J.

Kinetic Data Analysis—Nonlinear regression analyses of dependences of MurN initial velocity on substrate concentration were performed using GraphPad Prism 4 software. Preparation of Lipid-linked Cell Wall Precursors—In order to study the enzymology of MurN, access to its natural substrates (lipid II-l-Ala or lipid II-l-Ser) was required. These substrates were synthesized using a chemoenzymatic route. UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala was synthesized enzymatically, as described by Lloyd et al. (1.Lloyd A.J. Gilbey A.M. Blewett A.M. De Pascale G. El Zoeiby A. Levesque R.C. Catherwood A.C. Tomasz A. Bugg T.D. Roper D.I. Dowson C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6402-6417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and then chemically coupled with N-terminally protected l-alanine or l-serine to generate UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide (l-Ala or l-Ser) (Fig. 1), which was then converted to lipid II-l-Ala or lipid II-l-Ser using M. flavus membranes (21.Breukink E. van Heusden H.E. Vollmerhaus P.J. Swiezewska E. Brunner L. Walker S. Heck A.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19898-19903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Synthesis of UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptides—The protocol to attach l-alanine or l-serine on the ϵ-NH2 of l-lysine of the UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-γ-d-Glu-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala (Fig. 1) was based on a carbodiimide coupling reaction using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and promoted by N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (29.Staros J.V. Wright R.W. Swingle D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 220-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). EDC reacts with a carboxyl group on Fmoc-l-Ala or Fmoc-l-Ser, forming an amine-reactive O-acylisourea intermediate. The addition of NHS forms a water-soluble active ester, which is amine-reactive but more stable than the O-acylisourea EDC adduct, thus increasing the efficiency of EDC-mediated coupling reactions (29.Staros J.V. Wright R.W. Swingle D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 220-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The Fmoc group was then deprotected using piperidine. To maximize the efficiency of UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide formation, the pH, the incubation time, the concentrations of coupling reagent, and the protected amino acid were optimized. The activation of the protected amino acid with EDC/NHS was found to be optimal at pH 5.0, whereas the reaction of the resulting NHS ester with the amine of l-Lys of the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was favored at higher pH, at which the ϵ-NH2 of l-Lys (pKa 10.3) is more deprotonated. For this reason, the reaction was performed in two stages, first the activation of the protected amino acid was carried at pH 5.0, followed by the addition of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide in sodium carbonate at pH 10.0. The coupling reaction time was varied from 30 min up to 24 h, where 3 h has been established to be the optimum time. The same time-dependent profile was obtained for the addition of Fmoc-l-Ser to the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. In order to achieve a good yield, a large excess of coupling reagents and protected amino acid was necessary. It was found that the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide must be free of ammonium acetate, due to the possible reaction of the ammonia with the activated amino acid. For this reason, some batches of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide were further purified by gel filtration. The best results were obtained using 45 eq of EDC, 30 eq of NHS, and 12 eq of protected amino acid with respect to the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, with yields in the range 60–65%. Purification and Characterization of UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptides—The UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptides were purified by Source 30Q anion exchange chromatography, using a 0–300 mm ammonium acetate gradient. The UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide (l-Ala) was eluted at 195 mm NH4OAc (Fig. 2a). The UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide (l-Ser) was eluted at 205 mm NH4OAc, with a small amount of unreacted UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (Fig. 2b). The peaks containing UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptides (l-Ala/l-Ser) were freeze-dried four times to remove trace amounts of the buffer and then dissolved in water. The UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptides were analyzed by negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry. Electrospray MS/MS fragmentation was used to verify the position where l-Ala or l-Ser was attached to the peptide chain. The mass spectrum for UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide (l-Ala) showed m/z 609.25 for the [M – 2H]2– ion (calc. 609.20) and 405.82 for the [M – 3H]3– ion (calc. 405.80), shown in Fig. 2c. The mass spectrum for UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptide (l-Ser) showed m/z 1235.42 for the [M – H]– ion (calc. 1235.38) and 617.23 for the [M – 2H]2– ion (calc. 617.19), shown in Fig. 2d. The fragmentation patterns confirm that l-Ala/l-Ser are attached to the ϵ-NH2 of l-lysine of the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). No contamination by UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was observed. Synthesis of Lipid II-l-Ala and Lipid II-l-Ser—The UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptides (l-Ala/l-Ser) were converted into lipid II-l-Ala and lipid II-l-Ser using a membrane preparation of M. flavus, supplemented with undecaprenyl phosphate and the appropriate UDP-activated amino sugars, using the method of Breukink et al. (21.Breukink E. van Heusden H.E. Vollmerhaus P.J. Swiezewska E. Brunner L. Walker S. Heck A.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol.

Lipid II-l-Ala and lipid II-l-Ser were purified on a DEAE-cellulose column, using the method of Breukink et al. (21.Breukink E. van Heusden H.E. Vollmerhaus P.J. Swiezewska E. Brunner L. Walker S.

The lipid II-l-Ala and lipid II-l-Ser products were analyzed by negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry. For lipid II-l-Ala, peaks were observed at m/z 1945.03 ([M – H]– ion, calc. 1945.09), 972.05 ([M – 2H]2– ion, calc. 972.04), and 647.70 ([M – 3H]3– ion, calc. 647.69), as shown in Fig. 3c. For lipid II-l-Ser, peaks were observed at m/z 980.50 ([M – 2H]2– ion, calc. 980.54) and 653.34 ([M – 3H]3– ion, calc. 653.36) as shown in Fig. 3d. The yield after purification was 45–50% based on UDP-MurNAc-hexapeptides, in batches of about 2 mg of lipid II-l-Ala and lipid II-l-Ser from each reaction. Overexpression and Purification of MurN159 and MurNPn16—To overexpress MurN from S. pneumoniae 159 and Pn16, murN genes were cloned into several expression vectors: (i) pET-33b to allow expression of MurN fused to a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (30.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar); (ii) pMW172 to allow expression of MurN without a tag (31.Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar); (iii) pET33-MurN to allow expression of the MurM fused to MurN and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag; (iv) pBADM-41 (32.Lee S.K.

Microbiol. 2005; 71: 6856-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) to allow expression of MurN fused to N-His6-MBP with TEV protease cleavage site between the proteins. Small scale expression trials were performed using four E. coli expression strains: BL21Star (DE3), B834 (DE3), C41 (DE3), and TB1 harboring plasmid for rare tRNA (pRare or pRareII, Novagen) or for chaperones (pG"

This key reaction makes the biotin available for reutilization in the biotinylation of newly synthesized apocarboxylases. This latter reaction is catalyzed by holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) via synthesis of 5′-biotinyl-AMP (B-AMP) from biotin and ATP, followed by transfer of the biotin to a specific lysine residue of the apocarboxylase substrate. In addition to carboxylase activation, B-AMP is also a key regulatory molecule in the transcription of genes encoding apocarboxylases and HCS itself. In humans, genetic deficiency of HCS or biotinidase results in the life-threatening disorder biotin-responsive multiple carboxylase deficiency, characterized by a reduction in the activities of all biotin-dependent carboxylases. Although the clinical manifestations of both disorders are similar, they differ in some unique neurological characteristics whose origin is not fully understood. In this study, we show that biotinidase deficiency not only reduces net carboxylase biotinylation, but it also impairs the expression of carboxylases and HCS by interfering with the B-AMP-dependent mechanism of transcription control. We propose that biotinidase-deficient patients may develop a secondary HCS deficiency disrupting the altruistic tissue-specific biotin allocation mechanism that protects brain metabolism during biotin starvation.

Because of the importance of biotin in cell metabolism, higher organisms face a constant threat to their survival because they are incapable of synthesizing the vitamin. The situation is further complicated by the limited availability of biotin in nature, most of which is protein-bound and not directly accessible (2Wolf B. Scriver C. Beaudet A.L. William S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division, New York2001: 3935-3962Google Scholar, 14Pispa J. Ann. Med. Exp. Biol. Fenn. 1965; 43: 1-39PubMed Google Scholar). During evolution, mammals developed what is known as the biotin cycle, which allows them to cope with the low availability of this critical nutrient (Fig. 1). This system depends on two enzymes; holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) and biotinidase (1Pacheco-Alvarez D. Solórzano-Vargas R.S. Leon-Del-Rio A. Arch. Med. Res. 2002; 33: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Wolf B. Scriver C. Beaudet A.L. William S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division, New York2001: 3935-3962Google Scholar). HCS is responsible for the activation, via biotinylation, of all biotin-dependent carboxylases in human cells. The process takes place in a two-step, ATP-dependent reaction in which biotin is first activated to 5′-biotinyl-AMP (B-AMP) and then transferred to a specific and highly conserved lysine residue in all biotin-dependent carboxylases (2Wolf B.

We recently showed that HCS is an obligate participant in biotin-mediated transcriptional regulation (Fig. 1). The underlying mechanism requires B-AMP, the product of the HCS reaction, which activates a signal transduction cascade involving soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) (4Solórzano-Vargas R.S.

Paradoxically, biotin deficiency results in reduced expression of these genes in tissues such as liver, kidney, and muscle but not brain. Although this would seem to be contrary to the need for scavenging biotin during limited supply, we showed that this pattern of gene repression is an altruistic tissue-specific contingency mechanism that, by down-regulating biotin utilization in selected tissues, allows a concerted supply of the remaining vitamin to the brain (3Pacheco-Alvarez D.

In this organ, PC plays two essential roles: as a key player in anaplerosis of the Krebs cycle through pyruvate carboxylation and in the restoration of ;-ketoglutarate lost during the release of glutamate and ;-aminobutyric acid from neurons and glutamine export from glia (18Chiang G. Mistry S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Hassel B. Mol. Neurobiol. 2000; 22: 21-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In humans, the biotin cycle can be disrupted by genetic deficiency of holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS deficiency (MIM 253270)) or biotinidase (BTD deficiency (MIM 253260)), resulting in neonatal or juvenile onset forms, respectively, of the disease multiple carboxylase deficiency (MCD) (2Wolf B. Scriver C. Beaudet A.L. William S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division, New York2001: 3935-3962Google Scholar, 20Wolf B. Grier R.

Metab. 1999; 66: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the two diseases differ in the age of onset of symptoms, they share a number of clinical and biochemical manifestations, including decreased activities of all carboxylases, organic acidemia, hyperammonemia, dermatitis, alopecia, seizures, and coma. In biotinidase-deficient patients, neurological damage may also include mental retardation, hearing loss, and optic nerve atrophy (2Wolf B. Scriver C. Beaudet A.L. William S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division, New York2001: 3935-3962Google Scholar). Although potentially lethal, most of clinical and biochemical manifestations of neonatal and juvenile MCD can be successfully treated with pharmacological doses of biotin. The biotin-responsiveness of neonatal MCD patients is associated primarily with having at least one allele expressing a mutant HCS with an elevated Km for biotin, which allows for increased functional activity at high concentrations of biotin (1Pacheco-Alvarez D.

However, based on the participation of HCS in the biotin-dependent transcriptional regulation of the biotin cycle, we have suggested that the clinical and biochemical deficits in HCS-deficient patients reflect the combined effects of the low affinity of the mutant enzyme for biotin and the concomitant reduction in carboxylase and HCS mRNA levels (3Pacheco-Alvarez D. Solórzano-Vargas R.S. Gravel R.A. Cervantes-Roldán R. Velázquez A. León-Del-Río A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52312-52318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Solórzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In biotinidase-deficient patients, the biotin cycle is largely intact because free biotin can be successfully utilized for the biotinylation of carboxylases. Here the deficit has been thought to be in the inadequacy of the biotin supply because of the inability to recycle protein-bound biotin from endogenous or nutrient sources (2Wolf B. Scriver C. Beaudet A.L. William S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division, New York2001: 3935-3962Google Scholar). Therefore, supplementation with biotin at pharmacologic doses is thought to compensate for the loss of access to the additional biotin that would normally be available from protein sources (2Wolf B. Scriver C. Beaudet A.L. William S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Medical Publishing Division, New York2001: 3935-3962Google Scholar). Although the ultimate consequence of biotinidase deficiency is the interruption of the metabolic pathways where biotin-dependent carboxylases participate, the clinical manifestations that distinguish this disorder from HCS deficiency, especially in relation to neurological presentation, are not fully understood (22Sander J.E. Packman S. Townsend J.J. Neurology. 1982; 32: 878-880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we use fibroblasts from a biotinidase-deficient patient as an experimental model to study the role of this enzyme in carboxylase biotinylation and in HCS-sGC-PKG-dependent expression of biotin-dependent carboxylases and HCS under conditions of biotin deficiency and supplementation. Our results show that in biotinidase-deficient cells, biotin starvation results in a more rapid reduction in carboxylase biotinylation and in the expression of PC and MCC than in normal fibroblasts. We also demonstrate that in biotinidase-deficient cells the expression and activity of HCS is lower than in control cells. We propose that, in the absence of biotin supplementation, biotinidase-deficient patients may develop a secondary HCS deficiency that, combined with the primary biotinidase deficiency, may disrupt the altruistic regulation of biotin utilization that protects brain metabolism against vitamin starvation. Materials—Biotin, biocytin, 1-H(1,2,4)-oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinaxolin-1-one (ODQ), and 8-bromoguanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP) were from Sigma-Aldrich. d-[8,9–3H]biotin (34.0 Ci/mmol) was purchased to Amersham Biosciences. The biotinidase-deficient cell line MCD-BD was from the Montreal Children's Hospital Cell Repository for Mutant Human Cell Strains, and the HCS-deficient cell line MCD-MK (23Dupuis L. Leon-Del-Rio A.

Genet. 1996; 5: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the rabbit antibody to HCS (24Narang M.A. Dumas R. Ayer L.M. Gravel R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) were reported previously. Human normal fibroblasts were obtained from G. Soldevila (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Méx-ico). Escherichia coli C-124 cells have been previously described (16Leon-Del-Rio A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22964-22968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Leon-Del-Rio A. Leclerc D. Akerman B. Wakamatsu N. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4626-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cell cultures were maintained in ;-minimum Eagle's medium containing high glucose (Invitrogen; biotin concentration, 0.40 ;m) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 ;g/ml streptomycin (biotin-replete medium). Biotin-deficient medium was prepared using biotin-free minimum Eagle's medium, dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and the same antibiotic concentration. Cell Culture Experiments—The methods for biotin starvation of cell cultures are essentially as described previously (3Pacheco-Alvarez D. Solórzano-Vargas R.S. Gravel R.A. Cervantes-Roldán R. Velázquez A. León-Del-Río A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52312-52318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Solórzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown in biotin-replete or biotin-deficient medium at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for up to 13 days. The medium was changed at 3-day intervals. For carboxylase biotinylation recovery experiments, the cells grown in biotin-deficient medium were stimulated with biotin or biocytin, at concentrations from 1 to 100 nm for 24 h. Western Blot Analysis for HCS Expression and Carboxylase Biotin Content—Crude extracts from human cell cultures (30–100 ;g of total protein) were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore). The membranes were incubated in a 1:3000 solution of rabbit HCS antibody or with a 1:2000 solution of streptavidin-AP conjugate (Roche Applied Science) or with a 1:500 solution of goat MCC or PCC antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Visualization of HCS bands was performed using a BM chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Roche Applied Science). Biotin-containing bands were quantitated using an FX image analyzer (Bio-Rad) as described above. The protein concentration used in these experiments was determined using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Inc.), and confirmation of equal amounts of total protein in every lane was done by staining the gels with Coomassie Blue before protein transfer to PVDF membranes. Effect of Biotin and cGMP on Carboxylase Expression in Biotin-starved Cells—To determine the involvement of sGC on the recovery of biotinylation and carboxylase protein levels, biotin-starved normal fibroblasts were treated with 50 ;m ODQ, a specific inhibitor of sGC, for 3 h (4Solórzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After this period, 1 ;m biotin was added to the medium for 48 or 72 h, and the effect on MCC protein levels was compared with biotin-deficient cells stimulated by biotin without ODQ and cells grown continuously in normal medium (control cells). Alternatively, MCD-BD cells grown in biotin-free medium for 13 days were stimulated with 1 ;m biotin or 1 mm 8-Br-cGMP, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of cGMP. The cells were harvested after 48 or 72 h, and the MCC protein levels were determined as described above. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Procedures for RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and PCR have been previously described (3Pacheco-Alvarez D. Solórzano-Vargas R.S. Gravel R.A. Cervantes-Roldán R. Velázquez A. León-Del-Río A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52312-52318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Solórzano-Vargas R.S. Pacheco-Alvarez D. Leon-Del-Rio A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 5 ;g of total RNA and 0.5 ;m gene-specific oligonucleotide primers were used for cDNA synthesis and 0.3 ;m specific sense and antisense primers were used to give 200–300 bp of PCR products. The oligonucleotides used to amplify human mRNA were: HCS: 5′-CCC GAG CTC CGT CTC CTG GAT CGG-3′ and 5′-CCC AAG CCT TTT ACC GCC GTT TGG GGA-3′ (Tm = 58 °C); Biotinidase, 5′-ATC TAT GAA CAG CAA GTG ATG ACT-3′ (Tm = 66 °C) and 5′-AGG GAC CAG GGT GAA ATT GTC ATA-3′ (Tm = 70 °C); ;-actin: 5′-GGG TCA GAA TTC CTA TG-3′ and 5′-GGT CTC AAA CAT GAT CTG GG-3′ (Tm = 58 °C). PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The amount of PCR product was determined by densitometry by using a Fluor-S-imager (Bio-Rad) as previously described (3Pacheco-Alvarez D. Solórzano-Vargas R.S. Gravel R.A. Cervantes-Roldán R.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5325-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The procedure was validated in prior studies by PCR amplification of different concentrations of cDNA fragments of HCS, biotinidase, and ;-actin (data not shown). The number of PCR cycles was also varied and plotted against fluorescence intensity to ensure that experiments were done within the exponential phase. For every experiment, the constitutive ;-actin mRNA was used as the reference cellular transcript. It was present at equivalent levels in all RNA samples. HCS Activity Assay Using p67 as Biotinylation Substrate—To determine HCS activity in normal and MCD-BD fibroblasts, we used a modification of the protocol described previously (16Leon-Del-Rio A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22964-22968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Leon-Del-Rio A. Leclerc D. Akerman B. Wakamatsu N. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4626-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, a pFLAG vector (Sigma) containing a cDNA fragment encoding the last 67 amino acids (640–703) of the ; subunit of human PCC was used to transform wild type E. coli XL1 Blue and E. coli C-124, a mutant strain unable to synthesize dethiobiotin, an essential intermediate in the production of biotin. Log phase XL-1 and C-124 cultures in L-broth medium were transferred to a biotin-free medium (7.5 mm (NH4)2SO4, 33 mm KH2PO4, 60 mm K2HPO4, 1.7 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.2% dextrose, 0.1% casamino acids) and 2 mm isopropyl ;-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were sonicated three times with 10-s pulses and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The proteins in the supernatant were resolved by 12% acrylamide gel electrophoresis (100 ;g of total protein/lane) and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Two biotinylated proteins are possible in cells expressing p67: p67, at 14 kDa, and BCCP, the 18-kDa subunit of E. coli ACC. To detect their positions on the gel, one lane containing proteins expressed by XL1 cells transformed with p67 was cut off from the membrane and incubated with streptavidin-AP to detect the biotinylated proteins (see Fig. 6A). The lower band, corresponding to p67, was used as a reference to cut out the section of the membrane in adjacent lanes containing unbiotinylated or apo-p67 expressed by E. coli C-124. The membrane pieces containing apo-p67 were used, in solid phase format, for HCS assays. HCS activity was monitored by incubating the membrane pieces for 1 h at 25 °C in 150 ;l of reaction buffer containing Tri-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm reduced glutathione, 22.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1–3 ;Ci of [3H]biotin, and 100 ;g of total protein of crude extracts from normal or MCD-BD fibroblasts. For these experiments cells grown in biotin-supplemented medium were preincubated for 6 h with 1 ;m nonradioactive biotin and 63 ;m cycloheximide to block free biotinylation sites and prevent de novo carboxylases synthesis (5Pacheco-Alvarez D. Solórzano-Vargas R.S. González-Noriega A. Michalak C. Zempleni J. León-Del-Río A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 85: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Crude extracts were prepared as previously described and passed twice through an Amicon ultra centrifugal device (Millipore) to eliminate nonradioactive biotin. The radioactive biotin incorporated into the membrane-bound p67 was estimated using a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation counter. Under these conditions, the p67 was in excess, and the assay was linear for the 1 h of incubation. cDNA and Genomic DNA Sequencing—To determine the mutations responsible for the phenotype of MCD-BD cells, the biotinidase cDNA was cloned in the pGEM vector (Promega). Biotinidase exons were amplified from genomic DNA as previously described (26Wolf B. Jensen K.P. Barshop B. Blitzer M. Carlson M. Goudie D.R. Gokcay G.H. Demirkol M. Baykal T. Demir F. Quary S.

Genome. 1998; 9: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and subcloned also in pGEM. Both cDNA and exons were sequenced at Laragen (Los Angeles, CA). Statistical Analysis—All of the experiments were done in triplicate and at least three different times. The results of biotin starvation on mRNA were normalized to ;-actin mRNA and expressed as a percentage of mRNA levels observed in cells grown in biotin-replete medium. The data are presented as the mean of three different experiments ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance of p67 biotinylation results obtained with normal or MCD-BD cells were analyzed at 0.05 and 0.01 levels of significance using Student's t test one-way ANOVA. Molecular and Functional Characterization of the Biotinidase-deficient Cell Line MCD-BD—To characterize the cell line MCD-BD used as an experimental model in this study, we first identified the mutations responsible for biotinidase deficiency by sequencing the cDNA encoding this enzyme. This procedure resulted in the identification of a transversion 1330G → C, which causes a substitution of His for Asp444 (D444H), and a single base transition 511G → A, resulting in a substitution of Thr for Ala171 (A171T) (Fig. 2A). These mutations have been previously reported (26Wolf B. Jensen K.P. Barshop B. Blitzer M. Carlson M. Goudie D.R. Gokcay G.H. Demirkol M. Baykal T. Demir F. Quary S. Shih L.Y. Pedro H.F. Chen T.H. Slonim A.E. Hum. Mutat. 2005; 25: 413Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and are considered a common cause of profound biotinidase deficiency in children ascertained by newborn screening in the United States (28Norrgard K.J. Pomponio R.J. Swango K.L. Hymes J. Reynolds T. Buck G.A. Wolf B. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because these mutations were originally described as a double mutation allele (28Norrgard K.J. Pomponio R.J. Swango K.L. Hymes J. Reynolds T. Buck G.A. Wolf B. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 11: 410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we sequenced all four biotinidase exons from genomic DNA to search for another mutation. This procedure confirmed the identified mutations and did not reveal the presence of any other mutation. To verify the impact of these mutations, we tested the biotinylation status of the carboxylases PC, PCC, and MCC in MCD-BD cells and compared the results with normal fibroblasts (positive control) and MCD-MK fibroblasts (negative control). The latter cells have unbiotinylated carboxylases in the standard biotin-replete medium caused by a homozygous, h"

In this study, human cutaneous and gingival keratinocytes, ovary surface epithelia, and a porcine epithelial cell line were assayed by homology-based cloning, and the amplified DNA fragment was identified as a chymase. In vitro, chymase could not be induced by serum or cytokine treatment alone. Chymase was activated 3-fold within 60 min in basal media by scratch wounding cultured monolayers and further potentiated over 10-fold at 18 h by additional serum and cytokine treatment. Chymase activity was cell-associated and found to peak within 24 h of wounding and then steadily decreased as cultures healed, reaching baseline levels before confluence was reestablished. Affinity column purified enzyme effectively degraded fibronectin and was found by Western blot analysis using a human chymase antibody to be of about 30 kDa. Immunostaining revealed chymase activation at the wound edge colocalizing with reactive oxygen species generation. Specifically, chymase activation was attenuated by inhibition of nitric oxide, superoxide, and peroxynitrite. Exogenous peroxynitrite but not hydrogen peroxide also resulted in chymase activation in unwounded monolayers. Disruption of cytoskeletal stress fibers by cytochalasin D attenuated both wound-activated chymase and reactive oxygen species generation. Chymase inhibitor chymostatin reduced the loss of cell-cell contacts and the onset of porcine and human skin epithelial cell migration at the wound edge. This shows that an epithelial chymase is rapidly activated by a ligand-independent mechanism following mechanical stress via cytoskeletal and reactive oxygen species signaling and is associated with the onset of epithelial cell migration.

Chymase is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease, predominantly found in mast cells where it is stored within secretory granules as a zymogen complexed with heparin proteoglycan. It can be activated and released into the interstitial tissues following mechanical wounding such as vascular injury caused by balloon catheterization or vein grafting (1.Miyazaki M. Takai S. J. Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst. 2000; 1: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mast cell activation and subsequent degranulation can be induced by both ligand-dependent and -independent pathways. The ligand-dependent pathway operates through activation of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcϵRI) on the cell surface by IgE antigen triggering a cascade of signal transduction pathways (2.Galli S.J.

Conversely, chemical scavengers of peroxides and peroxynitrites almost completely abrogate ligand-independent mast cell activation. Also, treatment of mast cells with DPI, an inhibitor of NAD(P)H oxidase production of O2·¯, greatly reduced mast cell activation (3.Yoshimaru T. Suzuki Y. Inoue T. Niide O. Ra C. Free Radic. Med.

Chymase has several actions that could be involved in both normal and pathological wound healing such as angiotensin II formation (4.Guo C. Ju H. Leung D. Massaeli H. Shi M. Rabinovitch M. J. Clin.

The presence of mast cell chymase has been noted in skin wounds (9.Nishikori Y. Kakizoe E. Kobayashi Y. Shimoura K. Okunishi H. Dekio S. Arch. Dermatol.

A few studies have reported non-mast cell sources of chymase. A human heart chymase cDNA was cloned from ventricular mRNA preparations. The purified protein from the same tissue was used to synthesize a polyclonal antibody, which then detected chymase localized to the interstitium of the myocardium, the granules of mast cells, endothelial cells, and cells described as “mesenchymal” but not myocytes (11.Urata H. Kinoshita A. Perez D.M. Misono K.S. Bumpus F.M. Graham R.M. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17173-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human heart chymase was also found by Western immunoblot to be distributed in other tissues, including uterus, tonsil, stomach, esophagus, coronary artery, and aorta, although the cellular origin within these tissues was not determined (12.Urata H. Strobel F. Ganten D. J. Hypertens. 1994; 12: S17-S22Google Scholar). Also, homology-based cloning has been used to generate a full-length cDNA of a novel chymase from rat vascular smooth muscle cells. DNA sequencing showed the clone to have homology to the five known rat mast cell chymases of between 59 and 81%. Southern blot analysis showed the smooth muscle chymase gene to reside at a chromosomal location distinct from any of the mast cell chymases. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization detected mRNA expression in pulmonary artery and aortic smooth muscle cells. Its expression in these two tissues was elevated 8- and 11-fold, respectively, in hypertrophied tissues. Furthermore, substrate and protease inhibitor assays detected chymase activity in primary smooth muscle cell cultures from rat, porcine, and human aorta and pulmonary artery (4.Guo C. Ju H. Leung D. Massaeli H. Shi M. Rabinovitch M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Immunostaining of human renal tissue using a mast cell chymase antibody was able to localize chymase also to vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and perivascular myofibroblasts. However, the expression of chymase was absent in glomerular and tubular epithelial cells (13.Huang X.R. Chen W.Y. Truong L.D. Lan H.Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1738-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To date, there are no reports of epithelial chymotrypsin-like proteases being involved in wound healing. Stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme (kallikrein 7) is located in high suprabasal keratinocytes of skin epidermis and mucosal epithelial cells of the hard palate where it plays a central role in epidermal homeostasis (14.Sondell B. Thornell L.E. Stigbrand T. Egelrud T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and may also be involved in skin inflammatory reactions (15.Ekholm E. Sondell B. Strandén P. Bratts M. Egelrud T. Acta Derm. Venereol. 1998; 78: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown the expression in human normal ovarian surface epithelial cells of a chymotryptic activity that could be up-regulated by culturing on fibrin clots (16.Kruk P.A. Uitto V.-J. Firth J.D. Dedhar S. Auersperg N. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We also showed the production of a chymotryptic protease in cultured normal human epithelial keratinocytes (NHEK), human gingival, and porcine periodontal ligament epithelia (PLE) cell lines. This activity was released in very low amounts into the media, which was detectable after affinity column purification of conditioned medium (17.Firth J.D. Sue E.S. Putnins E.E. Oda D. Uitto V.-J. J. Periodontal Res. 1996; 31: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Further characterization was required to identify the chymotryptic activity and elucidate its activation mechanism and physiological function. Therefore, in this study we first identified epithelial chymotryptic activity from four normal epithelial cell types by homology-based cloning and DNA sequencing. Second, using PLE we investigated chymase activation using an in vitro scratch wound model of dense cell monolayers in either basal media (ligand-independent) or supplemented media (ligand-dependent) conditions. Third, chymase expression was localized relative to the wound edge. Fourth, we studied the role of mechanical wound-induced ROS and cytoskeleton organization associated with the rapid ligand-independent activation of the epithelial chymase. Finally, we studied possible physiological functions by assaying the degradation of fibronectin, and using both PLE and NHEK correlated the activation of epithelial chymase at the wound edge with the onset of epithelial cell migration. Cell Culture—Commercial normal human epithelial keratinocytes were cultured in KGM (Lonza, Allendale, NJ) according to the supplier's direction. Human gingival keratinocytes were a gift from Dr. D. Oda (University of Washington, Seattle) and were also cultured in KGM. Porcine ligament epithelial cells were isolated as described previously (17.Firth J.D. Sue E.S. Putnins E.E. Oda D. Uitto V.-J. J. Periodontal Res. 1996; 31: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA). Human ovary surface epithelia, a gift from Dr. P. Kruk (University of South Florida, Tampa), were cultured in Medium 199:MCDB 105 with 10% FBS. All media contained 100 IU/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 50 ng/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Homology-based Cloning—GenBank™ sequences of several chymotrypsin-like proteases were aligned using ClustalW as follows: 1) human neutrophil cathepsin G (hCAT-G); 2) rat mast cell proteinase II (rMCP II); 3) mouse granzyme B (GranB); 4) human chymase (hCMA); 5) mouse mast cell protease II (mMCprt2); 6) dog mast cell chymase (dMC); and 7) stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme (hSCCE). PCR primers (forward, gtcacc/actt/gggg/agcccat/caa; reverse, ccca/ggagtca/tcccttgaatg) were used for RT-PCR to amplify from quiescent epithelial cultures, and the product was analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Gel fragments were subject to PCR-based two-pass DNA sequencing (Invitrogen). Protease Induction—Confluent monolayers of PLE were cultured to quiescence in basal α-minimum Eagle's medium for 18 h. Monolayers were then treated with H2O2, AgNO3, NH4Cl, or ONOO-, at various concentrations for 1 h at 4 °C, and then washed with prewarmed medium and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 1 h. In wound experiments confluent quiescent cultures were scratched with a 1-cm fragment of a fine tooth plastic comb covering the entire surface as described previously (18.Firth J.D. Putnins E.E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 222-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Control and wounded cultures were washed one time with basal media and then further cultured in basal media up to 18 h. Some cultures were supplemented with FBS, TGF-β1, epidermal growth factor, KGF-1, or platelet-derived growth factor (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The time course protease expression was assayed in parallel experiments of wounded monolayers and nonwounded, low density cultures supplemented with 10% FBS for up to 5 days. At 24-h intervals, cultures from both groups were stored intact at -20 °C. At the conclusion of experiments substrate was added directly to samples and incubated for 18 h. The changes in absorbance at 405 nm were recorded spectrophotometrically. Cultures were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 5% sucrose, PBS and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol. Images were digitally recorded, and relative surface area was calculated using NIH Image 1.62 (NIH, Bethesda), and enzyme activity was expressed on a per-cell basis. Substrate and Inhibitor Specificity—Cell or media samples were assayed for substrate specificity using the synthetic chromogenic substrates N-succinyl-l-alanyl-l-alanyl-l-prolyl-l-phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide (SAAPNA) for chymotrypsin-like, N-succinyl-l-alanyl-l-alanl-l-valyl-p-nitroanilide (SAAVNA) for elastase, N-succinyl-l-alanyl-l-alanyl-l-alanine p-nitroanilide (SAAANA) for proteosomic chymotrypsin, N-glycyl-l-phenyl-p-nitroanilide (GPNA) for dipeptidyl peptidase I, and N-α-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BAPNA) for trypsin-like activity. Assays were done at a final substrate concentration of 1 mm in PBS at 37 °C for 18 h. Enzyme inhibition was tested by incubating samples with 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-l-2-heptanone (TLCK; trypsin-like), tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), and chymostatin (chymotrypsin-like) or epoxymycin (proteosomic chymotrypsin-like) at concentrations up 50 μm in the presence of SAAPNA. Immunostaining—Experiments were performed on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips sterilized by glow discharge. Quiescent culture surfaces were scraped twice in an x-shape with a pipette tip and then further cultured for various times. Samples were fixed (2% paraformaldehyde, 5% sucrose, PBS), permeabilized (0.5% Triton X-100, PBS, 4 min), and then washed five times in PBS. Cells were quenched (fresh 0.5% NaBH4, PBS) and blocked (3.0 mg per ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg per ml glycine, PBS, 30 min). Samples were then incubated in the blocking solution with primary antibody to human chymase 1 (CMA1-Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then washed five times (0.1 mg per ml bovine serum albumin, PBS), incubated in block solution with Alexa 488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear stain for 1 h in the dark. Samples were washed three times with PBS and then mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, CA). Images were digitally recorded under laser epifluorescence at 488 nm. A parallel set of samples was processed for detection of ROS by preincubation with 0.5 mg/ml 3,3-diaminobenzidine, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, alone, or including 0.1 mg per ml of MnCl2 for 5 min before to 10 min after each time point. At each time point samples were then washed three times with PBS, counterstained with hematoxylin, washed three times with PBS again, then fixed (2% paraformaldehyde, 5% sucrose, PBS), and mounted. Images were digitally recorded under tungsten illumination. Alternatively, ROS was assayed by pretreatment with 10 μm DCFDA for 30 min prior to incubation with phallacidin or cytochalasin D and wounding and quantitated using NIH Image 1.62. Zymography—Cells were resuspended in nonreducing Laemmli buffer and loaded onto an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 mg/ml β-casein. After electrophoresis, gels were washed two times for 10 min with 100 ml of 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl at 22 °C, and then three times for 10 min with H2O. The gel was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and in some experiments 100 μm TPCK or TLCK, pH 7.4, at 37 °C overnight and then stained with 0.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 30 min in 40% methanol, 5% acetic acid and destained in H2O. The molecular weights of the lysis bands were determined by reference to wide range molecular mass markers (Invitrogen). Affinity Column Purification—One step purification of chymotrypsin-like activity was carried out as described previously (17.Firth J.D. Sue E.S. Putnins E.E. Oda D. Uitto V.-J. J. Periodontal Res. 1996; 31: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A 1-ml aprotinin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column was equilibrated by running through 20 ml of equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2). Media or cell lysate was passed through the column, which was then washed with equilibration buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm reached a base line. Bound protease was eluted (100 mm HCl, pH 1.0, 1 mm CaCl2) and collected in 100-μl aliquots into 50 μl of 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The protein elution profile was determined spectrophotometrically. Aliquots from each peak were pooled then concentrated with a 5-kDa molecular weight cutoff spin concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). Silver Stain Gel Analysis—An aliquot of column purified material in reducing loading buffer was fractionated on 12% PAGE. Gels were fixed for 1 h (40% EtOH, 10% acetic acid), washed three times (30% EtOH) for 20 min, and then washed in distilled water for 20 min. Gels were then sensitized in 0.02% Na2S2O3 for 1 min and then washed in H2O three times for 20 s. Gels were then incubated in fresh cold 0.1% AgNO3 for 20 min at 4 °C and then washed three times for 20 s in H2O, transferred to a fresh container, and washed once more in H2O. Gels were then developed in 3% Na2S2O3, 0.05% formalin until bands were visible. Development was then terminated by first washing in distilled water for 20 s and then washing in 5% acetic acid for 5 min. Gels were finally washed in H2O three times for 10 min and then digitally recorded under tungsten light. Western Blot Analysis—Wound crude lysates and column-purified material were fractionated by 12% PAGE and electroblotted to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The filter was blocked at room temperature for 1 h (5% skim milk powder, 0.1% Tween 20, TBS) and then membranes incubated with anti-human chymase antibody for 2 h at 22 °C. After washing the membranes three times with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. After 1 h of incubation at 22 °C, the membranes were extensively washed with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 followed by washing with TBS alone. The membranes were developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Migration Studies—PLE and NHEK cultured as described above were wounded in the presence of increasing concentrations of chymostatin. At 6 and 18 h after wounding fixed and crystal violet-stained cultures were analyzed by measuring cell migration distance past the marked wound origin (0 h) as described previously (19.Valster A. Tran N.L. Nakada M. Berens M.E. Chan A.Y. Symons M. Methods (San Diego). 2005; 37: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) of five randomly selected fields of treated and control cultures in three independent experiments. Statistical Analysis—Analysis of variance and Student's t test were used to compare means of two or more different treatment groups. The level of significance was set to p < 0.05 unless otherwise stated. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Epithelial Cells Express Chymase—PCR primers were designed for homology cloning of a segment of the highly conserved chymotrypsin-like substrate binding region around consensus sequences spanning the first (amino acids 52–57) and sixth (amino acids 192–198) catalytic residues (Fig. 1A). Four normal epithelial lines were cultured to quiescence at semiconfluence and then processed for RT-PCR. Amplified bands analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels showed a single band of the 396-bp predicted molecular weight (Fig. 1B). Excised bands were then processed for two-pass PCR-based dideoxy DNA sequencing reactions and analyzed chromogenically. Resulting sequence data were BLAST analyzed using the EMBL human data base. All four DNA sequences were found to be highly conserved over the area of interest and to show closest homology to human heart chymase (>90%). Sequence alignment for PLE and NHEK fragments are provided as supplemental material. Epithelial Chymase Activation Requires Mechanical Wounding—PLE were used in an in vitro scratch wounding model. Dense, quiescent cultures were scratch-wounded on a 1-mm grid (Fig. 2A, inset), as described previously (18.Firth J.D. Putnins E.E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 222-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and then further cultured for 4 h in either the basal media or media supplemented with 10% FBS. All groups were then cultured in fresh basal media for an additional 18 h. Media and cells were assayed with chromogenic substrates for chymotrypsin-like (SAAPNA), proteosomic chymotrypsin-like (SAAANA), elastase-like (SAAVNA), trypsin-like (BAPNA), and dipeptidyl peptidase I (GPNA) activity. None of the substrates revealed any detectable levels of these proteases in unconcentrated raw media samples as reported previously (17.Firth J.D. Sue E.S. Putnins E.E. Oda D. Uitto V.-J. J. Periodontal Res. 1996; 31: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or in 5-fold concentrated media (data not shown). Also, neither elastase nor proteosomic chymotrypsin-like activity was detected in any samples (data not shown). Chymase, tryptic and dipeptidyl peptidase I activity was detected in intact cell monolayers, and chymase and dipeptidyl peptidase I activities increased about 3-fold in wound cultures maintained in basal media. Wounded cultures pulse-supplemented with 10% FBS showed a 10-fold increase in chymase activity at 18 h. Tryptic and dipeptidyl peptidase I activities were not further increased by FBS treatment (Fig. 2A). Ligand-dependent induction was further studied by supplementing basal media-treated wounded cultures with cytokines characteristic of wound sites. It was found that there was a dose-dependent induction of cell-associated chymotrypic activity in response to TGF-β1, KGF-1, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor (Fig. 2B). The time course expression profile of chymotryptic activity in the wound model was assayed at 24-h intervals in parallel experiments of wounded monolayers and nonwounded, low density cultures supplemented with 10% FBS for up to 5 days. Cultures after wounding and nonwounded proliferating cultures showed a similar growth curve with a plateau being reached between day 4 and 5 that corresponded to confluence as recorded by visual inspection. Chymotryptic activity greatly increased in the wounded cultures by 24 h but rapidly decreased thereafter, approaching control levels 2–3 days before confluence was achieved. In contrast, the nonwounded, proliferating cultures showed no detectable modulation in chymotryptic activity (Fig. 2C). Chymase Is Cell Membrane-associated and Not Heparin-associated—Cell extracts were analyzed by β-casein zymography that is sensitive for chymotrypsin-like activity (Fig. 3A). Extracts from intact monolayers revealed two bands of 32 and 27 kDa, consistent with the molecular weight of chymase and a commonly observed degradation product, respectively (Fig. 3A, lane 1). Both of these bands were markedly stronger in the wounded cell fractions (Fig. 3A, lanes 2, 3, and 5). No activity was found in media samples (data not shown). Zymograms processed in the presence of chymotrypsin-like inhibitor TPCK showed almost complete inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity of cell extracts and pancreatic α-chymotrypsin control (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6), whereas trypsin-like inhibitor TLCK had a limited effect (lanes 3 and 4). Inhibition specificity was quantified by SAAPNA degradation using cells from wounded cultures in the presence of chymotrypsin-like inhibitors chymostatin and TPCK, proteosomic chymotrypsin-like inhibitor epoxymycin, and trypsin inhibitor TLCK. Both chymostatin and TPCK strongly reduced chymase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas epoxymycin had no effect. Consistent with the zymograms, the trypsin inhibitor had only a small effect (Fig. 3B). The inhibitor α-antitrypsin is known to be ineffective against chymase bound to heparin but highly inhibitory against unbound chymase (20.Lindstedt L. Lee M. Kovanen P.T. Arteriosclerosis. 2001; 155: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Concentration-dependent inhibition of chymase activity by α-antitrypsin (Fig. 3C) is in agreement with the previous report for rat vascular smooth muscle chymase (4.Guo C. Ju H. Leung D. Massaeli H. Shi M. Rabinovitch M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and consistent with the enzyme not being complexed with heparin upon activation. Exogenous intact heparin is thought to be cell-impermeant and known to modulate chymase specificity (21.Schick B. Austen K.F. Schwartz L.B. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 2571-2577PubMed Google Scholar). Exogenous heparin was found to inhibit activated chymase of intact cells indicating that it was, in part, cell membrane-associated. Cell lysates showed greater heparin inhibition consistent with intracellular chymase activation (Fig. 3D). Ligand-independent Activation Does Not Involve Chymase Synthesis—Chymase was subjected to aprotinin-Sepharose affinity column purification, and two elution peaks were detected as reported previously (17.Firth J.D. Sue E.S. Putnins E.E. Oda D. Uitto V.-J. J. Periodontal Res. 1996; 31: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The elution profile of intact and basal media wounded samples was virtually identical. However the magnitude of peaks was found to greatly increase in cultures wounded in the presence of FBS. Hence ligand-independent chymase induction does not involve synthesis, whereas ligand-dependent induction does (Fig. 4A). Samples were pooled from each peak for intact and FBS-treated wound groups (Fig. 4B) and then fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. A predominant peak at 30 kDa was observed, and relative protein amounts in the dominant band agreed with column elution peak sizes (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). Cell lysate and purified chymase were subject to zymography and showed a single dominant band of activity in both (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). Cell lysate and purified chymase were subject to Western analysis using an antibody to human chymase (CMA1). Again, a dominant band of 30 kDa was seen in both (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). Because fibronectin is a major physiological target of chymase (5.Tchougounova E. Forsberg E. Angelborg G. Kjellen L. Pejler G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3772-3777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), purified protease was incubated in the presence of commercial human fibronectin. Epithelial chymase totally degraded fibronectin (Fig. 4C). Chymase Activation at the Wound Edge Is Associated with ROS—Because wounding was found to be required for chymase activation, we focused on its possible mechanism via ligand-independent signaling. Epithelial wounding has been reported previously to induce rapid generation of ROS a"
https://openalex.org/W2001511903,"Cell polarity is a key element of development in most eukaryotes. The Rho GTPase-activating protein Rgd1p positively regulates the GTPase activity of Rho3p and Rho4p, which are involved in bud growth and cytokinesis, respectively, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rgd1p contains an F-BAR domain at its N-terminal end in addition to its RhoGAP domain at its C-terminal end. We demonstrate here that phospholipids discriminate between the GTPase activities of Rho3p and Rho4p through Rgd1p and specifically stimulate the RhoGAP activity on Rho4p. The central region of the protein contiguous to the F-BAR domain is required for this stimulation. The F-BAR region binds to phosphoinositides in vitro and also plays a key role in the localization of Rgd1p to the bud tip and neck during the cell cycle. Studies of heat-sensitive mutants lacking phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate suggested that Rgd1p initially binds to Golgi membranes via phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and is then transported to the plasma membrane, where it binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate. We demonstrate here the dual effects of phosphoinositides on a RhoGTPase-activating protein. Phosphoinositides both regulate the recruitment and trafficking of Rgd1p to membranes via the F-BAR domain and specifically stimulate GTPase-activating protein activity, consistent with functional interplay between lipids, RhoGAP, and its related GTPases in yeast growth."
https://openalex.org/W2008397405,"Background A central problem in systems biology research is the identification and extension of biological modules–groups of genes or proteins participating in a common cellular process or physical complex. As a result, there is a persistent need for practical, principled methods to infer the modular organization of genes from genome-scale data. Results We introduce a novel approach for the identification of modules based on the persistence of isolated gene groups within an evolving graph process. First, the underlying genomic data is summarized in the form of ranked gene–gene relationships, thereby accommodating studies that quantify the relevant biological relationship directly or indirectly. Then, the observed gene–gene relationship ranks are viewed as the outcome of a random graph process and candidate modules are given by the identifiable subgraphs that arise during this process. An isolation index is computed for each module, which quantifies the statistical significance of its survival time. Conclusions The Miso (module isolation) method predicts gene modules from genomic data and the associated isolation index provides a module-specific measure of confidence. Improving on existing alternative, such as graph clustering and the global pruning of dendrograms, this index offers two intuitively appealing features: (1) the score is module-specific; and (2) different choices of threshold correlate logically with the resulting performance, i.e. a stringent cutoff yields high quality predictions, but low sensitivity. Through the analysis of yeast phenotype data, the Miso method is shown to outperform existing alternatives, in terms of the specificity and sensitivity of its predictions."
