Members of this family are associated with important diseased states (including cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration) and have been utilized or proposed as clinically important biomarkers or therapeutic targets of interest. All human KLKs are synthesized as prepro-forms that are proteolytically processed to secreted pro-forms via the removal of an amino-terminal secretion signal peptide. The secreted inactive pro-KLKs are then activated extracellularly to mature peptidases by specific proteolytic release of their amino-terminal propeptide. Although a key step in the regulation of KLK function, details regarding the activation of the human pro-KLKs (i.e. the KLK “activome”) are unknown, to a significant extent, but have been postulated to involve “activation cascades” with other KLKs and endopeptidases. To characterize more completely the KLK activome, we have expressed from Escherichia coli individual KLK propeptides fused to the amino terminus of a soluble carrier protein. The ability of 12 different mature KLKs to process the 15 different pro-KLK peptide sequences has been determined. Various autolytic and cross-activation relationships identified using this system have subsequently been characterized using recombinant pro-KLK proteins. The results demonstrate the potential for extensive KLK activation cascades and, when combined with available data for the tissue-specific expression of the KLK family, permit the construction of specific regulatory cascades. One such tissue-specific cascade is proposed for the central nervous system.

Many of the KLKs are under the control of steroid hormones, and several KLKs are differentially regulated in specific types of cancer (4Clements J.A. Endocr.

However, the physiological consequence of such regulation is not well understood; nonetheless, the KLKs contain important known, and proposed, cancer biomarkers (8Diamandis E.P. Kim G.M. Expert Rev. Mol. Diagn. 2001; 1: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). KLK3 (“prostate-specific antigen”) is a widely used cancer biomarker for prostate cancer screening; levels greater than 10 ng/ml of blood serum prostate-specific antigen positively correlate with prostate cancer (9Stamey T.A.

Recent studies indicate the presence of elevated levels of KLK2 in addition to KLK3 in malignant prostatic tissue and serum; so the ratio of KLK2 to KLK3 is emerging as an additional important cancer diagnostic and prognostic tool (12Darson M.F.

KLK5, -7 and -14 are co-expressed in skin and have been postulated to function in the proteolytic events associated with skin desquamation and disorders thereof (15Brattsand M. Kim K. Lundh C. Haasum Y. Egelrud T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 198-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 16Lundstrom A. Kim T. Acta Dermato-Venereol. 1991; 71: 471-474PubMed Google Scholar). KLK6 has been shown to be involved in the process of inflammatory demyelination, and its specific inhibition can delay the onset and reduce the severity of animal models of such disease (17Blaber S.I. Kim B. Christophi G.P. Bernett M. Blaber M. Rodriguez M. Scarisbrick I.A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 920-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These and other observations identify the KLK family as gaining importance in the diagnosis and treatment of serious human diseases. All KLK proteins are naturally synthesized as prepro-enzymes that are proteolytically processed upon entering the secretory pathway to release the pre-peptide, yielding the secreted pro-form. The secreted pro-form is subsequently converted into the enzymatically active mature form by proteolytic release of the amino-terminal propeptide. Abnormal functional levels of the KLKs in diseased states may be influenced by specific activation or inhibition events. The familiar regulatory cascades of peptidases involved in thrombogenesis, fibrinolysis, and the complement system suggest that the KLK family may similarly participate in cascades of activation that regulate their function (15Brattsand M.

A comparison of the primary structure of the KLKs indicates that 11 members (KLK1, 2, 4–6, 8, 10–14) contain an Asp residue at the base of the S1 pocket (at position 189 using the chymotrypsin numbering scheme) and are therefore expected to exhibit trypsin-like specificity (22Hooper J.D.

The remaining members (KLK3, -7, -9, and -15) are expected to exhibit chymotrypsin-like, or novel, specificities. Reports of the substrate specificities of the KLK family include examples of trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, or dual substrate specificities (15Brattsand M. Kim K. Lundh C. Haasum Y. Egelrud T. J.

Cancer Biol. 2006; 12: 742-750Google Scholar), in general agreement with the nature of residue 189. Regarding the KLK propeptide sequences (Fig. 1), activation requires specific hydrolysis after Arg (KLK1–3, -5, and -9–11), Lys (KLK6–8 and -12–15), or Gln (KLK4). Within the trypsin-like group of KLKs, examples of preferential specificity for hydrolysis after Arg versus Lys residues have been reported (28Bernett M.J. Kim S.I. Scarisbrick I.A. Dhanarajan P.

Chem. 2005; 280: 14628-14635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, members of the KLK family that exhibit specificity for Arg, but have a P1 Lys in their pro-sequence, may be incapable of autoactivation (31Blaber S.I. Kim H. Scarisbrick I.A. Juliano M.A. Blaber M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5209-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); similarly, KLKs with chymotrypsin-like specificity that have either Arg or Lys in the P1 position of their propeptide may be incapable of autoactivation. In both of these cases, a distinct protease would regulate activation. The study of peptidase activation can present with various technical challenges. In the case of the KLKs the isolation of mature or pro-KLK from natural tissues is not practical, and commercially available mature and pro-forms of the KLKs currently represent a subset of the total 15-member family. In principle, it is a straightforward matter to produce recombinant pro-KLK proteins; however, in practice, this approach can be complicated by activation or degradation because of the action of endogenous host peptidases (30Michael I.P.

Ventura S. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Sotiropoulou G. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation studies can be complicated if the mature KLK is capable of autolytic inactivation (28Bernett M.J. Kim S.I. Scarisbrick I.A. Dhanarajan P. Thompson S.M. Blaber M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24562-24570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 29Luo L.Y. Kim S.J. C. Elliott M.B. Soosaipilla A. Diamandis E.P. Hum. Cancer Biol. 2006; 12: 742-750Google Scholar) or can attack and inactivate the activating peptidase. In an effort to provide rapid lead information regarding details of the KLK activome, and to circumvent the above technical concerns, we have taken the approach of characterizing the hydrolysis of the KLK propeptides as fusion proteins. Propeptide fusion constructs have been successfully utilized to study activation or release of fused heterologous proteins via the action of specific peptidases (34Nakayama A. Kim H. Furutani Y. Honjo M. J. Biotechnol. 1992; 23: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 35Tomasselli A.G. Kim A.A. Paddock D.J. Wheeler J.S. Kubiak T.M. Martin R.A. Moseley W.M. Mott J.E. White M.C. Leone J.W. Heinrikson R.L. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1997; 26: 39-49PubMed Google Scholar) and indeed form the basis of highly useful recognition cleavage sites (e.g. the enterokinase recognition sequence) for the release of affinity-tagged heterologously expressed recombinant proteins. We report the hydrolysis profile for all 15 pro-KLK fusion protein substrates with 12 different mature KLKs. The results demonstrate the potential for extensive activation interactions between members of the KLK family. Several KLKs demonstrate the potential for autoactivation; among these, three are known from the literature, and others are novel. A number of potential cross-activating relationships between different KLKs are also identified, including several reciprocal cross-activation relationships that can result in geometric amplification of an initial activation event. Eleven of the activation relationships identified from this study are subsequently confirmed utilizing recombinant pro-KLK proteins. Combining the activation information with available data regarding the tissue-specific distribution of the KLK permits construction of hypothetical tissue-specific activation cascades, and one such cascade for the CNS is proposed. Our design for an appropriate fusion protein utilized the available x-ray structure data for human pro-KLK6 (32Gomis-Ruth F.X. Kim A. Sotiropoulou G. Pampalakis G. Tsetsenis T. Villegas V. Aviles F.X. Coll M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27273-27281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which shows that the amino-terminal KLK propeptide is highly solvent-accessible and unstructured (Fig. 2). The human fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF) protein exhibits similar structural features of its amino terminus, the first 10 residues of which are oriented toward solvent and are unstructured in both x-ray and NMR data (36Blaber M. Kim J. Thomas K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 37Lozano R.M. Kim A. Gonzalez C. Jimenez M.A. Cuevas P. Redondo-Horcajo M. Sanz J.M. Rico M. Gimenez-Gallego G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4982-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have previously studied a mutant form of FGF that exhibits enhanced properties of thermostability and solubility (38Brych S.R. Kim V. Bienkiewicz E. Lee J. Logan T. Blaber M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 769-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, this FGF mutant has two surface Arg residues deleted, which render the mutant generally resistant to internal tryptic cleavage. In initial enzymatic digests with mature KLK6 (a trypsin-like KLK) and KLK3 (a chymotrypsin-like KLK), this mutant FGF protein exhibited no detectable internal hydrolysis after extended incubation (data not shown); thus, it appeared to be an ideal candidate as a benign, soluble, carrier protein for pro-KLK peptide fusion constructs. The size of the intact pro-KLK fusion protein (∼16,700 Da) in comparison with the size of the released KLK propeptide region (∼1,900 Da), or carboxyl-terminal FGF fragment (∼14,800 Da), permits rapid quantitation of propeptide hydrolysis using SDS-PAGE (with confirmation provided by mass spectrometry). Because the released FGF “product” is not an active peptidase, complications associated with secondary proteolytic events are avoided. As mentioned above, the KLKs belong to the S1A chymotrypsin-like family of serine peptidases. In the chymotrypsin family of peptidases, the key interactions affecting specificity have been identified as comprising the S3 to S1′ binding pockets (39Perona J.J. Kim C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29987-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) (corresponding to the binding of substrate P3 to P1′ positions). KLK1 is the most extensively characterized member of the KLK family, and ∼80% of the binding energy of peptide substrates and inhibitors to KLK1 is contributed by interactions within the peptidase S2 to S1′ pockets (40Deshpande M.S. Kim J. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 3094-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, interactions within the S2 to S2′ pockets of KLK1 are primary determinants of its Met–Lys bond cleavage specificity, and interactions within the S1′ to S3′ pockets have been identified as important contributors to efficient hydrolysis of short peptide substrates (41Chagas J.R. Kim F.C. Hirata I.Y. Almeida P.C. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Prado E.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Together, these data identify interactions within the S3 to S3′ pockets as forming key structural determinants of general substrate specificity, binding, and hydrolytic efficiency for the KLK family. The design of the pro-KLK fusion protein includes the entire complement of “P” positions, in addition to the P1′ through P6′ residues, for each KLK (Fig. 1), thus spanning key determinants of propeptide recognition for hydrolysis. Cloning of Pro-KLK Fusion Proteins—KLK propeptide fusion constructs made use of a previously reported mutant form of FGF combining the following mutations: L44F, M67I, L73V, A103G, Δ104–106, V109L, L111I, C117V, R119G, Δ120–122 (referred to as SYM6ΔΔ) (38Brych S.R. Kim V. Bienkiewicz E. Lee J. Logan T. Blaber M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 769-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The properties of SYM6ΔΔ include a substantial (16.1 kJ/mol) increase in thermal stability; a 10-fold increase in solubility (>50 mg/ml), and the elimination of basic residues on two surface loops. This latter property, in conjunction with the increased stability, renders SYM6ΔΔ resistant to internal proteolysis by both trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like peptidases; references to “FGF” herein refer to this SYM6ΔΔ mutant form. The pro-KLK peptide fusion construct utilizes residue positions 10–140 of FGF (numbering scheme of the 140 amino acid form of FGF) in addition to an amino-terminal His tag. Residue positions 1–9 of FGF are solvent-accessible and conformationally undefined in the x-ray structure (36Blaber M. Kim J. Thomas K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2086-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 37Lozano R.M. Kim A. Gonzalez C. Jimenez M.A. Cuevas P. Redondo-Horcajo M. Sanz J.M. Rico M. Gimenez-Gallego G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4982-4993Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). NheI (GCTAGC) and EcoRI (GAATTC) restriction sites were inserted between the amino-terminal His tag and amino acid position 10 of the FGF gene by PCR mutagenesis (oligonucleotides purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). These restriction sites are not found in any of the KLK sequences, or the FGF gene, and therefore permit easy insertion of DNA “cassettes” corresponding to pro-KLK sequences. This modified FGF construct was inserted into the pET21a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the correct nucleotide sequence was confirmed. The vector was subsequently digested with NheI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and gel-purified (“vector fragment”). Oligonucleotides (coding and noncoding) were synthesized and hybridized to produce duplex DNA fragments (“insert fragments”) corresponding to the prosequences of KLK1–15 with appropriate NheI and EcoRI half-sites. The KLK pro-sequences included in the fusion construct spanned the complete set of pro-KLK P positions, through the P6′ position, in each case (Fig. 1) Some KLKs contain relatively short propeptides (e.g. the KLK11 propeptide includes only the P3–P1 positions); in these cases, additional residues of the corresponding KLK pre-sequence were included in the design (Fig. 1) so as to permit detectable mass changes upon analysis by SDS-PAGE (see below). In the case of the pro-KLK4 sequence, a native Cys residue at position P3 was substituted by Ser to avoid potential disulfide bond-mediated dimer formation. The insert and vector fragments were ligated and transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli for protein expression. Expression of Pro-KLK Fusion Proteins—All expression and purification steps were performed at 4 °C following previously described procedures for the FGF mutant (42Brych S.R. Kim S.I. Logan T.M. Blaber M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), with slight modification. Briefly, the cell lysate from 1-liter fermentation in minimal media was loaded directly onto a 2.5 × 15-cm column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Elution was accomplished using a step gradient of 150 mm imidazole. Elution fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm ammonium sulfate, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, using 6–8-kDa molecular weight cutoff dialysis tubing (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA). The protein was then concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 75 size-exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography column (Pharmacia) and eluted in the same buffer. The pooled protein was loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 superfine size-exclusion low pressure column for buffer exchange into 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl (PBS), pH 7.4. The purified protein was concentrated to 1.0 mg/ml, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Whatman Inc., Florham Park, NJ), snap-frozen in dry ice/ethanol, and stored at –80 °C prior to use. Production of Mature KLK Proteins—All mature KLK proteins were derived from heterologous expression sources, and none were naturally isolated. Mature KLK1–3, -5–8, and -13 were expressed as recombinant proteins from an insect cell/baculovirus expression system as described previously (28Bernett M.J. Kim S.I. Scarisbrick I.A. Dhanarajan P.

Briefly, the cDNA for the mature form of each of these KLK was inserted into the pBAC3 transfer vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) immediately 3′ to a synthetic prepro-sequence containing a secretion signal, His tag, and enterokinase (EK; Asp4-Lys) activation pro-sequence, respectively. Recombinant protein was produced from the TN5 (Invitrogen) insect cell line and purified using the His tag with nickel affinity resin. Cleavage of the propeptide EK recognition sequence was performed by EK digestion (Roche Diagnostics). Separation of EK and the propeptide from the mature KLK protein was accomplished using Sephadex G-50 gel filtration (GE Healthcare) in 40 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 4.5. Proteins were concentrated to 1.0 mg/ml, snap-frozen in dry ice/ethanol, and stored at –80 °C prior to use. Sham purification experiments with nonexpressing insect cells demonstrated the absence of EK activity in the expected KLK elution fractions (data not shown). Molar extinction coefficients were calculated using the method of Gill and von Hippel (45Gill S.C. Kim P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Mature KLK4, -11, -12, and -14 were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) by activation of the pro-forms according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Production of Pro-KLK Proteins—Pro-KLK3, -4, -8, -11, -12, and -14 were obtained fromR&D Systems. Recombinant pro-KLK1 protein was expressed from yeast (Pichia pastoris). Briefly, the gene for pro-KLK1 (GenBank™ accession number AY094609) was subcloned into the pPicZαA transfer vector (Invitrogen) and included a carboxyl-terminal His tag for purification purposes. The pPiczαA vector was subsequently introduced into yeast strain X-33, and a stable clone was selected following the manufacturer’s instructions. Transformed yeast was grown in 10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 13.4 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 40 mg/liter biotin, and 5 ml/liter methanol in a 30 °C shaking incubator (250 rpm) for 2 days. Methanol induction (5 ml/liter) was maintained every 24 h. Media containing the secreted pro-KLK1 protein were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g, followed by 0.2-μm filtration of the supernatant, and then loading directly onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) (all purification steps were performed at 4 °C). Elution of the nickel-affinity resin was performed using a step gradient of 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween, pH 7.5. The eluted pro-KLK1 protein was pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, using 6–8-kDa molecular weight cutoff dialysis tubing (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA). The dialyzed protein was passed over a benzamidine-Sepharose affinity column (GE Healthcare) to remove any traces of contaminating yeast trypsin-like peptidases. The pro-KLK1 protein was subsequently loaded onto a Q-Sepharose anion-exchange column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a 1 m NaCl gradient. The pooled fractions were concentrated to 1.0 mg/ml and were loaded onto a Superdex 75 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with PBS. Purity and homogeneity of recombinant pro-KLK1 fractions were evaluated by 16.5% Tricine SDS-PAGE and amino-terminal sequencing. Pro-KLK1 fractions were subsequently pooled and concentrated to 1.0 mg/ml, snap-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. The molar extinction coefficient of the purified protein was calculated based on the spectroscopic method of Gill and von Hippel (45Gill S.C. Kim P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). To confirm the absence of contaminating host peptidase activity, purified pro-KLK1 was concentrated to 40 μm, incubated at 37 °C for 6 h at pH 8.0, and analyzed using 16.5% Tricine SDS-PAGE. Pro-KLK6 was expressed as a recombinant protein from HEK293 human embryonic kidney epithelial cells as the expression host, as described previously (31Blaber S.I. Kim H. Scarisbrick I.A. Juliano M.A. Blaber M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5209-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, pro-KLK6 was designed to be expressed as a fusion construct with a carboxyl-terminal Strep tag and His tag, respectively. The cDNA encoding human prepro-KLK6 was cloned into the pSecTag2/HygroB expression vector (Invitrogen). In this construct the native KLK6 secretion signal was utilized to direct secretion into the culture media. The HEK293 culture media were harvested 2 days after transfection, and the pro-KLK6 was purified by sequential affinity chromatography utilizing nickel-affinity resin and Strep-Tactin Superflow media (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), respectively. Purity and homogeneity of recombinant pro-KLK6 were evaluated by"

Several pleckstrin homology (PH) domains have been reported to interact with PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. To understand how these PH domains differentially respond to PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signals, we quantitatively determined the PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding properties of several PH domains, including Akt, ARNO, Btk, DAPP1, Grp1, and C-terminal TAPP1 PH domains by surface plasmon resonance and monolayer penetration analyses. The measurements revealed that these PH domains have significant different phosphoinositide specificities and affinities. Btk-PH and TAPP1-PH showed genuine PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 specificities, respectively, whereas other PH domains exhibited less pronounced specificities. Also, the PH domains showed different degrees of membrane penetration, which greatly affected the kinetics of their membrane dissociation. Mutational studies showed that the presence of two proximal hydrophobic residues on the membrane-binding surface of the PH domain is important for membrane penetration and sustained membrane residence. When NIH 3T3 cells were stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor to generate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, reversible translocation of Btk-PH, Grp1-PH, ARNO-PH, DAPP1-PH, and its L177A mutant to the plasma membrane was consistent with their in vitro membrane binding properties. Collectively, these studies provide new insight into how various PH domains would differentially respond to cellular PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signals.

Rev. 2004; 84: 699-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Although PIs are minor components of membrane lipids, they regulate a wide range of biological processes, including cell proliferation, cell survival, differentiation, signal transduction, cytoskeleton organization, and membrane trafficking (1Di Paolo G. Kim P. Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar, 2De Matteis M.A. Kim A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 3Roth M.G. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 699-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). PIs regulate these cellular processes primarily by serving as site-specific membrane signals that mediate the membrane recruitment and regulation of effector proteins. The PI-mediated cellular processes allow exceptional spatiotemporal specificity because the spatial and temporal distribution of various PIs is dynamically and tightly regulated by a series of PI-modifying enzymes, such as phospholipases, lipid kinases, and lipid phosphatases, located in different cell membranes (1Di Paolo G. Kim P. Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar, 2De Matteis M.A. Kim A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 3Roth M.G. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 699-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). For instance, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) are mainly found in the plasma membrane, whereas phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns5P), and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) are primarily present in endosomes, Golgi, nucleus, and multivesicular bodies, respectively (1Di Paolo G. Kim P. Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar, 2De Matteis M.A. Kim A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 3Roth M.G. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 699-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Also, some PIs, such as PtdIns(4,5)P2, are present at significant steady-state levels in quiescent cells, whereas phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulate transiently in stimulated cells (4Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 have received much attention recently because of their critical role in cell signaling (4Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar, 5Rameh L.E. Kim L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is primarily generated from PtdIns(4,5)P2 by PI 3-kinases in response to specific receptor activation. PtdIns(3,4)P2 is formed either by hydrolysis of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by 5-phosphatases, such as Src homology 2 domain-containing inositol phosphatases (SHIP1 and SHIP2), or by phosphorylation of PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(4)P by PI 4-kinase and PI 3-kinases, respectively (5Rameh L.E. Kim L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). It has been reported that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation after cell stimulation is immediate and transient, whereas PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulation is slightly delayed and significantly more sustained in platelets (6Banfic H.

Also, unlike PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 that is primarily present in the plasma membrane, PtdIns(3,4)P2 may be localized at endosomes, intraluminal vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum, as well as the plasma membrane (8Ivetac I.

Although PH domains show low amino acid sequence homology, they have a conserved structural fold (see Fig. 1A) that consists of a 7-stranded β-sandwich (β1 to β7), one end of which is capped by a C-terminal α-helix, and the open end is connected by three variable loops (β1-β2, β3-β4, and β6-β7 loops). PH domains also show characteristic electrostatic polarization with a strong positive electrostatic potential surrounding the variable loops (see Fig. 1B) (32Singh S.M. Kim D. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1934-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

However, PI specificities of these PH domains have been determined by a wide variety of methods under different conditions. This makes it difficult to quantitatively compare their PI specificities and affinities and predict which PH domain will preferentially respond to PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 formation under a given condition. In general, membrane binding of lipid binding domains is initiated by nonspecific electrostatic interactions between anionic lipids and cationic protein residues, which is followed by specific ligand binding and/or partial membrane penetration (9Cho W. Kim R.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2005; 34: 119-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the partial membrane penetration is important for the membrane recruitment and activation of lipid binding domains and their host proteins (9Cho W. Kim R.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys.

For this reason, the depth of membrane penetration has been determined for various lipid binding domains by several biophysical techniques, including electron spin resonance (45Malmberg N.J. Kim J.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2005; 34: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and x-ray reflectivity (46Malkova S. Kim F. Stahelin R.V. Pingali S.V. Murray D. Cho W. Schlossman M.L.

Although the depth of membrane penetration has not been reported for any PH domain, PH domains are generally thought to be S-type proteins whose membrane binding does not involve a significant degree of membrane penetration (9Cho W. Kim R.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2005; 34: 119-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 10DiNitto J.P. Kim T.C. Lambright D.G. Sci.

This is largely because of the presence of a large number of cationic residues and the apparent lack of hydrophobic residues on their membrane-binding surfaces (32Singh S.M. Kim D.

However, recent studies have indicated that the PH domain of phospholipase C (PLC) δ1 significantly penetrates the membrane (52Tuzi S. Kim N. Okada M. Yamaguchi S. Saito H. Yagisawa H. J. Biol.

To systematically study the mechanism by which PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 induce the membrane recruitment of their effector proteins, we quantitatively determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and monolayer penetration analyses the PI affinities, specificities, and membrane binding properties of several PH domains that have been reported to bind PtdIns(3,4)P2 and/or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The results reveal new PI specificities for these PH domains and also show that they have distinctively different membrane binding mechanisms, different degrees of membrane penetration in particular, due in part to variable distribution of hydrophobic residues in their membrane binding loops. Materials—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) were purchased from Cayman. The concentrations of the phospholipids were determined by a modified Bartlett analysis. Octyl glucoside was purchased from Fisher. The Pioneer L1 sensor chip was purchased from Biacore AB (Piscataway, NJ). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was from Bayer, Inc. (Kankakee, IL). Vector Construction and Mutagenesis—The cDNAs of murine Grp1, human Btk, murine ARNO, and human DAPP1 PH domains were subcloned into the vector pKTM, between the restriction sites BamHI and EcoRI. pKTM is a modified vector of pET-21a (+), with an optional N-terminal His6 tag and a Gly-Ser linker. DAPP1 PH domain mutants, L117A, V178A, and R184A, were generated by the overlap extension PCR and also subcloned into the pKTM vector. The cDNAs of the human Akt PH domain and the human TAPP1 C-terminal (TAPP1c) PH domain were subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 (Novagen, Madison, WI) vector, containing an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion. PH domain mutants were generated by the overlap extension PCR and subcloned into corresponding vectors. All of the above constructs were transformed into DH5α cells for plasmid isolation, and their DNA sequences were verified. Those constructs subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells, whereas those subcloned into the pKTM vector were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. For the cellular translocation work in NIH 3T3 cells, the PH domains of Grp1, Btk, ARNO, DAPP1, and its L177A mutant, respectively, were subcloned between the HindIII and PstI sites of the mCerulean-C1 vector (54Rizzo M.A. Kim G.H. Granada B. Piston D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) and pEGFP-C2 vector, respectively, to yield the PH domains with cyan fluorescence protein (CFP) (54Rizzo M.A. Kim G.H. Granada B. Piston D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar) and enhanced fluorescence green protein (EGFP), respectively, at the N terminus. The mCerulean-C1 vector was a generous gift of Dr. David Piston. Protein Expression and Purification—For the expression of the Akt PH domain and the wild type and mutants of the TAPP1c PH domain, 1 liter of Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with BL21 cells harboring the PH domain construct and grown at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 250 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Research Products, Mount Prospect, IL), and cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) after 14 h of incubation at 25 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, containing 160 mm KCl, 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. This solution was sonicated for 10 min (30 s of sonication followed by 30 s of cooling on ice) and then centrifuged for 30 min (48,000 × g at 4 °C). After filtering the supernatant into a 50-ml Falcon tube, 500 μl of the glutathione S-transferase Tag™ resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) was added. After incubating this mixture on ice for 45 min with mild shaking at 80 rpm, it was poured onto a column pre-rinsed with 20 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, containing 160 mm KCl. After washing the non-specifically bound protein with 50 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, containing 160 mm KCl, 1 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.4, containing 160 mm KCl, 25 mm CaCl2, and 1 unit of thrombin was added to cleave the glutathione S-transferase tag, and the column was sealed for the 12 h of incubation at 4 °C. The protein was then eluted in five fractions using 500 μl of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, containing 160 mm KCl. All the fractions were collected together and purified by ion-exchange chromatography (see below). For the expression of the Grp1, Btk, ARNO, and DAPP1 PH domains, 1 liter of Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with BL21(DE3) cells harboring each construct, and the culture was grown at 37 °C until absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.5. At this time, 1 mm of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and cells were then incubated at 25 °C for 14 h. Cells were harvested for 10 min at 5000 × g, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, containing 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The solution was then sonicated for 10 min (30 s sonication followed by 30 s cooling on ice). This was followed by centrifugation for 30 min (48,000 × g at 4 °C). The supernatant was filtered into a 50-ml tube, and 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was added. The mixture was incubated on ice with gentle stirring (80 rpm) for 1 h. After this time, the mixture was poured onto a column filled with 20 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. After sequentially washing the nonspecifically bound protein with 50 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl containing 10, 15, 20, and 50 mm imidazole, respectively, the protein was eluted in five fractions using 1 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 300 mm imidazole. All the fractions were pooled and diluted with deionized water to 50 ml and purified using either a Q-Sepharose column for Akt-PH or a S-Sepharose column for all other PH domains, which was connected to the áKTA FPLC system. The column was equilibrated with 20 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5 (Grp1-PH and ARNO-PH), 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4 (Btk-PH and TAPP1c-PH), or 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0 (Akt-PH), depending on the isoelectric point of the PH domain, and the elution was performed with the linear increase of KCl from 0 to 2 m in the same buffer. Protein purity was checked on an 18% polyacrylamide gel, and the protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). The purified proteins were stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with 0.16 m KCl. SPR Measurements—All SPR measurements were performed at 23 °C using a lipid-coated L1 chip in the BIAcore X system as described previously (55Stahelin R.V. Kim W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing the sensor chip surface with the running buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 m KCl), POPC/POPE/PI (77:20:3), and POPC/POPE (80:20), vesicles were injected at 5 μl/min to the active surface and the control surface, respectively, to give the same resonance unit values. The level of lipid coating for both surfaces was kept at the minimum that is necessary for preventing the nonspecific adsorption to the sensor chips. This low surface coverage minimized the mass transport effect and kept the total protein concentration (P0) above the total concentration of protein-binding sites o"
https://openalex.org/W1978632856,"EAAT2 (excitatory amino acid transporter 2) is a high affinity, Na+-dependent glutamate transporter of glial origin that is essential for the clearance of synaptically released glutamate and prevention of excitotoxicity. During the course of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in a transgenic mutant SOD1 mouse model of the disease, expression and activity of EAAT2 is remarkably reduced. We previously showed that some of the mutant SOD1 proteins exposed to oxidative stress inhibit EAAT2 by triggering caspase-3 cleavage of EAAT2 at a single defined locus. This gives rise to two fragments that we termed truncated EAAT2 and COOH terminus of EAAT2 (CTE). In this study, we report that analysis of spinal cord homogenates prepared from mutant G93A-SOD1 mice reveals CTE to be of a higher molecular weight than expected because it is conjugated with SUMO-1. The sumoylated CTE fragment (CTE-SUMO-1) accumulates in the spinal cord of these mice as early as presymptomatic stage (70 days of age) and not in other central nervous system areas unaffected by the disease. The presence and accumulation of CTE-SUMO-1 is specific to ALS mice, since it does not occur in the R6/2 mouse model for Huntington disease. Furthermore, using an astroglial cell line, primary culture of astrocytes, and tissue samples from G93A-SOD1 mice, we show that CTE-SUMO-1 is targeted to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. Since one of the proposed functions of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies is regulation of gene transcription, we suggest a possible novel mechanism by which the glial glutamate transporter EAAT2 could contribute to the pathology of ALS."

https://openalex.org/W2085897097,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the most abundant protein in low density lipoproteins and plays key roles in cholesterol homeostasis. The co-translational degradation of apoB is controlled by fatty acid levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is mediated by the proteasome.

With the aid of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), lipids are added co-translationally to apoB in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which results in the formation of a primordial lipoprotein (1Hussain M.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These primordial particles mature upon the acquisition of additional lipids in the secretory pathway and are ultimately transported to the plasma to deliver cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, and triglycerides to peripheral tissues. While much attention has been given to mutations of the LDL receptor causing hypercholesterolemia and accelerated atherosclerosis, mutations in apoB that interfere with LDL endocytosis also lead to hypercholesterolemia (3Whitfield A.J.

Targeted down-regulation of hepatic apoB production lowers the levels of circulating cholesterol in rodents and non-human primates and may thereby reduce atherosclerosis (4Soutschek J. Akinc A.

Thus, any means to lower apoB levels has the potential for a therapeutic benefit. ApoB synthesis, and consequently the formation of LDL and VLDL particles, is under tight metabolic control, particularly during its co-translational translocation into the ER (2Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17377-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). When lipids are limiting or if MTP is absent or its function is blocked, apoB translocation is slowed but continued apoB translation exposes large cytoplasmic domains. The resulting translocon-associated apoB species is bound by the cytosolic Hsp70 and Hsp90 molecular chaperones and the polypeptide is polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. This process ensures that lipoprotein particles, which require apoB for assembly, form only if cellular lipids are abundant and prevents the self-aggregation of hydrophobic domains. The Hsp70- and Hsp90-catalyzed degradation of apoB is in accordance with the roles that these chaperones play during the targeting of aberrant proteins for proteasomal degradation. Although Hsp70s and Hsp90s facilitate the folding and assembly of multi-protein complexes, these chaperones also recruit components in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP), most notably E3 ubiquitin ligases, if a polypeptide substrate is unable to achieve its native conformation (7Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 368-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In its most general form, chaperone-mediated protein “triage” appears to be conserved from yeast to man. For example, we found that in vitro translated apoB was degraded when apoB-containing microsomes were incubated with cytosol prepared from either hepatic cells or yeast; however, degradation was significantly compromised if cytosol was obtained from yeast harboring mutant alleles in the genes encoding either a cytosolic Hsp70 (Ssa1p) or Hsp90 (Hsp82p) (8Gusarova V.

Not only is apoB degradation metabolically regulated, but it is robust only in select cell types and occurs co-translationally (9Fisher E.A. Zhou M. Mitchell D.M. Wu X. Omura S. Wang H. Goldberg A.L.

These studies suggest that apoB, in addition to being subject to the general ERAD machinery, will also require a unique set of factors that facilitate its biogenesis and degradation. Consistent with this hypothesis, apoB is one of the few ERAD substrates whose degradation requires P58IPK, a chaperone/TPR domain-containing protein (17Oyadomari S. Yun C. Fisher E.A. Kreglinger N.

Based on its role in preventing protein aggregation, we hypothesized that Hsp110 may impact the biogenesis of this hydrophobic, aggregation-prone protein. Hsp110s are abundant, cytoplasmic heat shock proteins that maintain the solubility of denatured proteins and possess an N-terminal ATP-binding domain that is homologous to the Hsp70 N-terminal domain (18Easton D.P.

These results suggested to us that Hsp110/Sse1p may facilitate the Hsp70/Hsp90-dependent degradation of apoB co-translationally. We report here that Hsp110/Sse1p, rather than promoting apoB ERAD, is required to stabilize apoB. Our initial results were obtained from cell-free assays that utilize components isolated from wild type and mutant yeast strains. To confirm and extend these data, we also established a yeast apoB expression system and then examined the effects of Hsp110 overexpression in mammalian cells. These results not only identify Hsp110 as a target to reduce cholesterol, but implicate apoB as an Hsp110 client.

Fuller, University of Michigan), which contains a pBM258 backbone with amino acids 1–100 from the yeast mating factor alpha 1 locus inserted into the BamHI and SalI restriction sites (28Zhang H. Komano H. Fuller R.S. Gandy S.E. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27799-27802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next, a triple hemagglutinin (HA) tag (YPYDVPDYA) was PCR-amplified with a 5′ XbaI, an internal ClaI, a 3′ SalI restriction site, and tandem stop codons (5′-TAA TGA-3′), and was inserted into pJJB20 at the XbaI and SalI sites to form plasmid pSLW1 (supplemental Table S1). ApoB29 was then amplified from the SP6-apoB48 plasmid (8Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) by PCR with the following primers: (forward) 5′-ATT GCC AGC ATT GCT AAA GAA GAA GGG GTA TCA CTA CTC AAG AGG AAA ATG TCA GCC TGG TCG TC-3′ and (reverse) 5′-GGG ATA GCC CGC ATA CTC AGG AAC ATC GTA TGG GTA ATC GAT ACT GTA GGA GGC GGA CCA GTT GCT-3′. Finally, ClaI- and XbaI-digested pSLW1 and the apoB29 PCR product were co-transformed into yeast strain W3031b, and colonies containing the gap-repaired pSLW1 plasmid with the apoB29 insert were selected by growth on synthetic complete medium lacking uracil. Plasmid DNA from yeast harboring the pSLW1-B29 plasmid (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table S1) was prepared, and the integrity of the plasmid was confirmed by sequence analysis. All other plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. In Vitro and in Vivo Methods to Quantify ApoB Degradation—ApoB48 degradation was assessed in vitro as previously described (8Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), except that time points were taken at 5, 15, and 30 min. The cytosol used in the reactions was prepared as previously described (11McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and was diluted to a final concentration of 5–10 μg/μl and preincubated with either 250 μm MG132 (Peptides International) or an equivalent volume of Me2SO for 15 min on ice. The reactions were quenched by adding an equal volume of 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 6 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and the samples were heated at 96 °C for 4 min prior to SDS-PAGE. Phosphorimager data were analyzed using Image Gauge software (Fuji Film Science Laboratory). To examine the effect of purified Sse1p on apoB stabilization, hexahistidine-tagged Sse1p was purified as previously described (23Goeckeler J.L. Stephens A. Lee P. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), dialyzed into 20 mm HEPES, pH7.4, 110 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and added into the cytosol at a final concentration of 3% of the total protein. The reaction was incubated on ice for 15 min before the degradation reaction commenced. To measure apoB29 ERAD in yeast, cells transformed with pSLW1-B29 (see above) were grown to logarithmic phase (A600 = 0.4–1.0) overnight at 26 °C in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil but supplemented with glucose to a final concentration of 2%. To obtain maximal expression of apoB29, the cells were harvested and resuspended to an initial concentration of 0.5 A600/ml in complete medium (Yeast Extract-Peptone) containing galactose at a final concentration of 2% and were grown at 30 °C for 5 h. To monitor apoB degradation, protein synthesis was stopped by the addition of cycloheximide to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, 2 absorbance units of cells were harvested at indicated time points, and total protein was precipitated as previously described (29Zhang Y. Nijbroek G. Sullivan M.L. McCracken A.A. Watkins S.C. Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) was utilized for anti-L3 immunoblots and the Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce) was used for anti-HA and anti-apoB immunoblots. The signals were quantified using a Kodak 440CF Image Station and the associated Kodak 1D (v3.6) software (Rochester, NY). The cycloheximide chase analysis of CFTR-HA and Ste6p*-HA and the pulse chase analysis of ppαfΔG-HA and CPY*-HA were performed as previously described (29Zhang Y. Nijbroek G. Sullivan M.L.

Previous studies on ERAD in yeast have failed to uncover a difference in chaperone dependence on the degradation of ER-associated proteins when either cycloheximide or metabolic labeling followed by a methionine chase was employed. 4J. L. Brodsky, unpublished data. For all cycloheximide chase analyses, each time point was normalized to the L3 loading control, and the relative amount of apoB was calculated by dividing the signal at each time by the value at t = 0. Biochemical and Immunological Methods—ApoB29 expression was induced as above and a total of 100 ODs of cells were harvested and fractionated as previously published (33Kabani M. Kelley S.S. Morrow M.W. Montgomery D.L. Sivendran R. Rose M.D. Gierasch L.M. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3437-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To assess whether apoB29 was carbonate-extractable, ∼40 μgof yeast lysate prepared as described for the fractionation analysis were treated with 100 mm NaCO3, pH 11.5 (33Kabani M. Kelley S.S. Morrow M.W. Montgomery D.L. Sivendran R. Rose M.D. Gierasch L.M. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3437-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The apoB sucrose gradient flotation assay was performed as published (29Zhang Y. Nijbroek G. Sullivan M.L. McCracken A.A. Watkins S.C. Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For apoB interaction studies, cell extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis from 100 absorbance units of yeast grown as described above, and immunoprecipitations were conducted in the presence of 20 mm NaMoO4 (20Yam A.Y. Albanese V. Lin H.T. Frydman J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41252-41261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using anti-Sse1p, anti-Ssa1p, anti-Ssb1p, anti-Sec61p, or anti-Sec63p antiserum (see above). For apoB immunoprecipitation experiments with the anti-HA resin (Roche Applied Science), cell extracts from 100 absorbance units of yeast were prepared by 3 5-min agitations with glass beads in modified Roche lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 20 mm NaMoO4) with protease inhibitors (0.25 mm MG132, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A). Next, 1 mg of cell extract was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA resin or Sepharose 6B beads that were used as a negative control (Sigma). The beads were washed twice with Roche lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 300 mm NaCl, respectively. The isolated protein precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the relevant proteins were identified by immunoblot analysis as described above. Hsp110 Overexpression in Rat Hepatoma Cells—Rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells were cultured and transfected with either the pcDNA3.1 vector (control) or the pcDNA3.1-Hsp110 expression vector (provided by Dr. J. Subjeck, Roswell Park Cancer Institute), and 48 h after transfection a pulse-chase analysis was performed as previously described (8Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Experiments to which either oleic acid or the MTP inhibitor was added (at a final concentration of 0.625 μm and 0.1 nm respectively) measured the amount of apoB-precipitable material from vector versus Hsp110-overexpressing cells after a 15-min pulse and 60-min chase. Degradation of Microsomal ApoB48 Is Enhanced in Yeast Cytosol Lacking Sse1p—To determine if Sse1p contributes to the regulated degradation of apoB, we utilized cytosols prepared from sse1Δ yeast and an isogenic wild-type strain in a previously established in vitro ERAD assay (8Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this assay, an isoform of apoB (“apoB48”) is translated in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes and 35S-labeled methionine, and after reisolation of the apoB-containing vesicles, the degradation of the radiolabeled substrate is measured in the presence of yeast cell lysates. ApoB48, which is ∼48% of the size of full-length apoB (260 kDa), is expressed endogenously and secreted from rodent hepatic and rodent and human intestinal cells, and undergoes MTP and lipid-dependent maturation (34Wu A.L. Windmueller H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3615-3618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As published previously (8Gusarova V. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24891-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), ∼70% of the apoB remained after 30 min in a reaction supplemented with cytosol from a wild-type yeast strain. The observed degradation was also MG132-inhibitable, indicating that it was proteasome-dependent (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, when apoB degradation was examined in the presence of cytosol from the sse1Δ strain, only ∼50% of the translated apoB remained following a 30-min incubation. Sse1p is reported to interact with and modulate the ATPase activity of two cytosolic Hsp70s in yeast, Ssa1p and Ssb1p (20Yam A.Y. Albanese V. Lin H.T. Frydman J. J. Biol.

To this end, cytosols were prepared from a strain deleted for SSB1 and the SSB2 homologue and from an isogenic wild-type strain. Next, apoB degradation was assessed in vitro (Fig. 1C). In contrast to the pro-degradative effect of Ssa1p on apoB a"
https://openalex.org/W2008417818,"The BCL-2 homologue MCL-1 plays an important role in the regulation of cell fate by blocking apoptosis as well as regulating cell cycle. MCL-1 has an unusual N-terminal extension, which contains a PEST domain and several phosphorylation sites that have been suggested to regulate its turnover. Here we report that the first 79 amino acids of MCL-1 regulate its subcellular localization. Deletion of this domain impairs both its mitochondrial localization and its anti-apoptotic activity. Conversely, expression of the N terminus of MCL-1 promotes both the association of MCL-1 with mitochondria and cell survival in a fashion that is dependent on the presence of endogenous MCL-1. In addition, the N terminus of MCL-1 has an antagonistic effect on proliferation. Although MCL-1 decreases proliferation through binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 in the nucleus, the N terminus of MCL-1 accelerates cell division. On the other hand, deletion of this region further increases the anti-proliferative activity of MCL-1. These results suggest that the N terminus of MCL-1 plays a major regulatory role, regulating coordinately the mitochondrial (anti-apoptotic) and nuclear (anti-proliferative) functions of MCL-1.

Apoptosis is a genetically conserved form of programmed cell death required for normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. As such, it plays a major role in the prevention of cancer by causing the destruction of damaged or otherwise altered cells (1Danial N.N. Kim S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar, 2Fesik S.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 876-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Induction of apoptosis after such damage is usually achieved through the intrinsic, or mitochondrial, pathway. In this pathway loss of mitochondrial integrity results in cytochrome c (cyt c) 3The abbreviations used are: cyt c, cytochrome c; Ad, adenovector; BH, BCL-2 homology; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; CHX, cycloheximide; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; Nt-MCL, N terminus of MCL-1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; zVAD-FMK, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone; pfu, plaque-forming units; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Ctrl, control; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; CDK1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1. release and subsequent activation of a series of apoptotic proteases, known as caspases, through the formation of the apoptosome, a protein complex composed of APAF-1, caspase-9, and cyt c (1Danial N.N. Kim S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Events leading to the release of cyt c from mitochondria are controlled by the BCL-2 family of proteins that are characterized by the presence of at least one BCL-2 homology (BH) domain (1Danial N.N. Kim S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar, 3Labi V. Kim M. Kiessling S. Villunger A. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1325-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Several BCL-2 homologues also possess a C-terminal transmembrane domain that mediates their association with mitochondria (4Germain M. Kim G.C. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : pe10Google Scholar, 5Kaufmann T. Kim S. Sanz J. Neubert K. Stein R. Borner C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK, containing BH1–3, are required for permeabilization of mitochondria, although their exact mechanism of action is still debated. Both proteins are kept inactive in healthy cells and become activated through a change in conformation upon induction of apoptosis, leading to their oligomerization (1Danial N.N. Kim S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar, 3Labi V. Kim M. Kiessling S. Villunger A. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1325-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This activation is regulated by a balance between two antagonistic classes of BCL-2 homologues: BH3-only and anti-apoptotic proteins. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins such as BCL-2 itself, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 inhibit apoptosis by blocking either directly or indirectly the activation of BAX and BAK (1Danial N.N. Kim S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar, 3Labi V. Kim M. Kiessling S. Villunger A. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1325-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interaction between BCL-2 family members is mediated by a groove formed by the BH1–3 domains in the BCL-2 homology region on the one hand and the α-helix formed by the BH3 of the pro-apoptotic proteins on the other hand (2Fesik S.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 876-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). These interactions play a requisite role in the regulation of BCL-2 family proteins. MCL-1 is an anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologue that is necessary for early embryonic development as well as for the generation and maintenance of hematopoietic cell lineages (6Opferman J.T. Kim H. Ong C.C. Suh H. Mizuno S. Akashi K. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2005; 307: 1101-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 7Rinkenberger J.L. Kim S. Klocke B. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 23-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MCL-1 has a short half-life, and its protein levels are tightly regulated both transcriptionally and through proteasomal degradation (8Michels J. Kim P.W. Packham G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Degradation of MCL-1 after UV irradiation is required for induction of apoptosis (9Nijhawan D. Kim M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Conversely, MCL-1 protein levels are increased in several human cancers, and its overexpression in transgenic mice leads to malignancies (8Michels J. Kim P.W. Packham G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 10Zhou P. Kim L. Bieszczad C.K. Noelle R. Binder M. Levy N.B. Craig R.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 3226-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Paradoxically, MCL-1 has also been reported to delay cell cycle progression in S/G2 through interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) (11Fujise K. Kim D. Liu J. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39458-39465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 12Jamil S. Kim R. Hojabrpour P. Raj M. Kast J. Duronio V. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This has been associated with a nuclear localization of MCL-1, as opposed to its mitochondrial anti-apoptotic function. MCL-1 is, thus, an important regulatory protein in the context of development and oncogenesis. Structurally, MCL-1 differs from other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins in two respects. First, differences in amino acid charge distribution in the BCL-2 homology region allow for a different specificity toward BH3-only proteins as compared with BCL-2 and BCL-XL (13Day C.L. Kim L. Richardson S.J. Harrison P.J. Huang D.C. Hinds M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4738-4744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Second, MCL-1 possesses a 170-amino acid extension at its N terminus that contains two PEST domains and several phosphorylation sites. This N-terminal extension is a potential regulatory domain for the degradation of MCL-1 through its PEST sequences (14Kozopas K.M. Kim T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), which contain phosphorylation sites that promote the recruitment of the E3 ligase β-TRCP (15Maurer U. Kim C. Wagman A.S. Dejardin E. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 16Ding Q. Kim X. Hsu J.M. Xia W. Chen C.T. Li L.Y. Lee D.F. Liu J.C. Zhong Q. Wang X. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4006-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) as well as caspase cleavage sites (17Herrant M. Kim A. Marchetti S. Belhacene N. Colosetti P. Luciano F. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7863-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Here we report that the first 79 amino acids of MCL-1 regulate its subcellular localization, promoting its association with mitochondria. Overexpression of the N terminus of MCL-1 (Nt-MCL) promoted cell survival by recruiting more MCL-1 at this organelle, whereas deletion of this sequence (MCL-1 ΔN79) partially impaired both its mitochondrial localization and anti-apoptotic activity. Conversely, MCL-1ΔN79 inhibited cell growth more potently than MCL-1, whereas Nt-MCL increased proliferation. These results suggest that that the N terminus of MCL-1 plays an important regulatory role in the function of MCL-1. MCL-1 Constructs—To generate Nt-MCL, full-length MCL-1 in pcDNA3.1/V5-His(A) (cloned between BamHI and EcoRI) was digested using BamHI and NotI and cloned into the same vector to give a fusion protein expressing the first 79 amino acids of MCL-1 with a His and a V5 tag at its C terminus. V5-MCL-1ΔN79 and V5-MCL-1ΔN54 were generated by replacing the first 79 or 54 amino acids of MCL-1 by a V5 tag using PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1/His-V5(A) between BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. MCL-1ΔTM was generated by removing amino acids 321–350 using PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1/His-V5. Nt-MCL-GFP was generated by fusing the first 79 amino acids of MCL-1 to the N terminus of GFP using PCR. Both GFP and Nt-MCL-GFP were cloned into pcDNA3.1/His-V5 vector. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Infections with Adenoviral Vectors—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 20 mm l-glutamine. To generate cell lines stably expressing full-length MCL-1 or the deletion mutants, HeLa cells were transfected with the various constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and selected with G418. For UV irradiation, cells were grown to 95% confluency (or 50% confluency for immunofluorescence), the medium was removed, and the cells were irradiated using 200 mJ/cm2 UVB. Fresh medium (containing 50 μm zVAD-FMK in the case of immunofluorescence) was then added, and the cells were further incubated for the indicated time. Infections with adenoviral vectors coding for tBID and NOXA (a gift of Dr. Gordon Shore) were carried out as described (18Germain M. Kim J.P. McBride H.M. Shore G.C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1546-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) using 50 and 10 plaque-forming units/cell of virus, respectively. All infections were carried in the presence of 50 μm zVAD-FMK. For determination of caspase activity, 50 μg of cell extract were incubated with 100 μm DEVD-p-nitroanilide in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 2 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm. SV-40-transformed wild-type and MCL-1Δ/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF; a gift of Dr. Joseph Opferman) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. MEFs were transfected with Metafectene Pro (Biotex). Adenoviral infections were carried out on cells grown on glass coverslips (90% confluence) using 200 pfu/cell Ad tBID in the presence of 50 μm zVAD-FMK. Antibodies and Immunoblots—The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-β-actin, mouse anti-BrdUrd, and mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-MCL-1 and mouse anti-BCL-X (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-MCL-1 (Pharmingen), mouse anti-cyt c (78H.2C12, Pharmingen), rabbit anti-BAK, and rabbit anti-p85 PI3K (Upstate), mouse anti V5 antibody (Invitrogen), rabbit anti-GFP (Molecular Probes), rabbit anti-TOM20 (a gift from Dr. Gordon Shore (19Germain M. Kim J.P. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18053-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates were incubated for 2 h with the antibody and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. For immunoblot analysis, proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with specific antibodies. Blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Half-life Determination—To determine the half-life of MCL-1, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the various constructs for 24 h, after which they were either irradiated using 200 mJ/cm2 UVB or treated with 10 μm cycloheximide (CHX). The experiment was also repeated in the presence of 10 μm MG132 as a control. Cell were harvested at the indicated times and analyzed by Western blot using a MCL-1-specific antibody as well as a p85 PI3K antibody as a loading control. The density of the bands was quantified using Image J software and normalized using the p85 PI3K blot. Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on coverslips and treated as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by immunofluorescence using AlexaFluor 488 and AlexaFluor 594 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were then visualized using an Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) with a 100 × 1.30 oil objective (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Images were captured and overlaid using Northern Eclipse software. siRNA—Cells were transfected with siRNA specific for GFP, BCL-X, and MCL-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Silent-Fect (Bio-Rad) transfection reagent. 10 nm siRNA was used for siRNA GFP and siRNA BCL-X, whereas 6.67 nm was used for siRNA MCL-1 to reduce toxicity. Cells were collected after 24 h analyzed for protein expression by Western blot. Isolation of Mitochondria and Alkaline Extraction—Mitochondria were isolated as previously described (19Germain M. Kim J.P. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18053-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cells were harvested and resuspended in HIM buffer (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA). Cells were broken by passing them 24 times through a 25-gauge needle. Nucleus and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 9000 × g to pellet the heavy membrane fraction containing mitochondria. For alkaline extraction, 30 μg of heavy membrane were incubated for 30 min on ice with 0.1 m Na2CO3 followed by centrifugation at 50 000 × g to recover the membranes (19Germain M. Kim J.P. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18053-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). BrdUrd Incorporation—Cells were transfected with the indicated constructs and 24 h later pulsed for 1 h with 10 μm BrdUrd. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained for GFP or MCL-1. After a second fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, coverslips were treated with 4 m HCl in 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, washed, and stained for BrdUrd. The First 79 Amino Acids of MCL-1 Regulate Its Anti-apoptotic Activity after UV Irradiation—MCL-1 has a long N-terminal region containing a PEST domain, which is not required for binding to other BCL-2 homologues (13Day C.L. Kim L. Richardson S.J. Harrison P.J. Huang D.C. Hinds M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4738-4744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Caspase-mediated cleavage of this domain (at Asp-127 and Asp-157) has been reported to impair the anti-apoptotic function of MCL-1 (17Herrant M. Kim A. Marchetti S. Belhacene N. Colosetti P. Luciano F. Auberger P. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7863-7873Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Michels J. Kim J.W. Dallman C.L. Mouzakiti A. Habens F. Brimmell M. Zhang K.Y. Craig R.W. Marcusson E.G. Johnson P.W. Packham G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4818-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To test the anti-apoptotic activity of different N-terminal deletions of MCL-1 that do not disrupt its PEST domain and, therefore, should not affect its half-life, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with several MCL-1 deletion mutants, and cyt c release was analyzed by immunofluorescence after irradiation of the cells with 200 mJ/cm2 UV. As shown in Fig. 1A, MCL-1 almost completely blocked cyt c release in this context, whereas the activity of mutants lacking the first 54 (MCL-1ΔN54) or 79 amino acids (MCL-1ΔN79) was partially impaired. A similar effect was observed when the C-terminal transmembrane domain was deleted (MCL-1ΔTM). The increased cyt c release observed for the MCL-1 mutants, as compared with wild-type MCL-1, was not a consequence of their lower expression as they were all expressed at similar or higher levels (MCL-1ΔN79) as compared with full-length MCL-1 (Fig. 1B). Similarly, stable expression of MCL-1ΔN79 in HeLa cells, despite being expressed at higher levels than the wild-type protein (Fig. 1C), only partially prevented cyt c release and caspase activation, as compared with the full-length protein, after UV irradiation (Fig. 1, D and E). MCL-1 is a protein with a short half-life, and its degradation after UV irradiation is required for subsequent induction of apoptosis (9Nijhawan D. Kim M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). A recent report indicating that deletion of the first 20 or so amino acids of MCL-1 led to an increased stability of the protein (21De Biasio A. Kim J.A. Zhou P. Qian L. Bieszczad C.K. Braley K.E. Domina A.M. Weintraub S.J. Neveu J.M. Lane W.S. Craig R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23919-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as the greater expression of MCL-1ΔN79 (Fig. 1) suggested that MCL-1ΔN79 could have an altered half-life. To test whether the impaired activity of MCL-1ΔN79 is due to an altered half-life, the degradation rate of the different MCL-1 constructs was tested after CHX treatment and UV irradiation. The half-life of overexpressed MCL-1, as determined using CHX, was very short (about 60 min) and was not influenced by the ΔN79 deletion (Fig. 2A). Similarly, UV irradiation of HeLa cells provoked the rapid degradation of both MCL-1 and MCL-1ΔN79, with similar kinetics (Fig. 2A). The caspase-cleaved form of BID (tBID) promotes apoptosis by directly activating BAX and BAK at the mitochondria (22Ruffolo S.C. Kim G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25039-25045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 23Wei M.C. Kim T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, apoptosis induced after infection of HeLa cells with an adenovirus expressing tBID (Ad tBID) occurs in the absence of MCL-1 degradation (Fig. 2B). In this context full-length MCL-1, but not MCL-1ΔN79, could reduce significantly tBID-induced cyt c release (Fig. 2C). Altogether, these results suggest that the altered anti-apoptotic activity of MCL-1ΔN79 is not a consequence of altered sensitivity to proteasomal degradation. MCL-1 prevents apoptosis at least in part by sequestering pro-apoptotic BAK (24Willis S.N. Kim L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Although complete deletion of the N-terminal portion of MCL-1 does not affect binding to BH3-only proteins (13Day C.L. Kim L. Richardson S.J. Harrison P.J. Huang D.C. Hinds M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4738-4744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), the effect of the N79 deletion on the interaction between BAK and MCL-1 was tested. Because full-length MCL-1 and BAK interacted very weakly in CHAPS-containing buffer (data not shown), the experiment was carried in Triton X-100-containing buffer as a measure of the capacity of these proteins to interact. Wild-type MCL-1 and MCL-1ΔN79 were transiently transfected into HeLa cells along with FLAG-BAK, followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D, FLAG-BAK immunoprecipitated both MCL-1 constructs with a similar efficiency, indicating that the N79 deletion does not directly disrupt the interaction between MCL-1 and BAK. The First 79 Amino Acids of MCL-1 Are Required for Its Mitochondrial Localization—MCL-1 localizes to the mitochondria where it can block apoptosis by interacting with pro-apoptotic BAK (24Willis S.N. Kim L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 25Chou C.H. Kim R.S. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3952-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because deletion of the C-terminal transmembrane domain of MCL-1 had a similar effect on its anti-apoptotic activity than the ΔN79 deletion, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the different MCL-1 constructs. This was tested in transiently transfected HeLa cells using a MCL-1-specific antibody, as the levels of endogenous MCL-1 in HeLa cells are below detection levels by immunofluorescence (see the untransfected cells which do not show MCL-1 staining in Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3A, full-length MCL-1 co-localized with the mitochondrial protein TOM20. In contrast, MCL-1ΔN79 localized to the cytosol in a majority of the cells, although a weak association with mitochondria could still be observed (Fig. 3A, V5-MCL-ΔN79 is depicted; similar results were obtained in absence of the tag (not shown)). As expected, deletion of the C-terminal transmembrane domain, which is required to target BCL-2 homologues to intracellular membranes (5Kaufmann T. Kim S. Sanz J. Neubert K. Stein R. Borner C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), showed no mitochondrial localization (MCL-1ΔTM; Fig. 3A). To determine whether the N-terminal 79 amino acids of MCL-1 act as a mitochondrial targeting sequence, this domain was expressed as a GFP fusion protein (Nt-MCL-GFP). As shown in Fig. 3B, Nt-MCL-GFP localized to the cytosol. Similar results were obtained when Nt-MCL was tagged with a V5 epitope at its C terminus (not shown). This suggests that although required for the proper mitochondrial localization of MCL-1, this domain is not sufficient. Nt-MCL Enhances the Mitochondrial Localization of MCL-1—The number of cells demonstrating mitochondrial localization of MCL-1 was quantified for each construct. Only cells in which most of MCL-1 co-localized with TOM20 (as for MCL-1 in Fig. 3A) were counted as mitochondrial. Although full-length MCL-1 was mitochondrial in most cells, MCL-1ΔN79 co-localized with TOM20 in only 15% of the cells (Fig. 4A). As expected, there was no association of MCL-1ΔTM with mitochondria (Fig. 4A). The effect of the expression of Nt-MCL on the localization of MCL-1 was then tested. HeLa calls stably expressing a V5-tagged version of Nt-MCL (Nt-MCL-V5) were transiently transfected with the different constructs, examined by immunofluorescence using a MCL-1-specific antibody, and scored for mitochondrial localization of the MCL-1 constructs. As shown in Fig. 4A, Nt-MCL-V5 significantly increased the mitochondrial localization of both full-length MCL-1 and MCL-1ΔN79 but had no effect on MCL-1ΔTM, consistent with the requirement of the transmembrane domain for mitochondrial targeting. MCL-1 is synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes before being imported into mitochondria. If the cytosolic localization of MCL-1ΔN79 is the consequence of a slower rate of import, it should nevertheless accumulate at the mitochondria given enough time. Therefore, by preventing synthesis of new MCL-1ΔN79 using CHX, it should be possible to observe its accumulation at the mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 4B, the number of cells with mitochondrial MCL-1ΔN79 did increase in a time-dependent manner after the inhibition of protein synthesis, whereas the localization of MCL-1 and MCL-1ΔTM was not affected. In addition, Nt-MCL-V5 did increase the rate at which cells with mitochondrial MCL-1ΔN79 appeared (Fig. 4C) but had no effect on the half-life of MCL-1ΔN79 under these conditions (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that mitochondrial targeting is less efficient in MCL-1ΔN79 and that the presence of Nt-MCL can at least partially compensate for this defect. Although the bulk of endogenous MCL-1 is found associated with mitochondria, some can also be found in the cytosol or nucleus under some conditions (9Nijhawan D. Kim M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 11Fujise K. Kim D. Liu J. Yeh E.T. J. Biol.

J. 2005; 387: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To test whether Nt-MCL can enhance the mitochondrial localization of endogenous MCL-1, HeLa cells stably expressing vector alone or Nt-MCL-V5 were fractionated, and the heavy membrane-containing mitochondria were isolated (19Germain M. Kim J.P. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18053-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The presence of Nt-MCL resulted in an increase in the amount of MCL-1 associated with heavy membrane (HM; Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that Nt-MCL stimulates the association between MCL-1 and mitochondria. However, there was also a small increase (≈20%) in the total amount of MCL-1 in Nt-MCL-expressing cells (Fig. 5, A and B) that may partially account for the increase in mitochondrial MCL-1. Therefore, to better establish the role of Nt-MCL in promoting the association between MCL-1 and mitochondria, we looked at its insertion into mitochondria. MCL-1, like other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 homologues, is predicted to insert into the outer mitochondrial membrane through its C-terminal transmembrane domain and, thus, be resistant to extraction by 0.1 m Na2CO3. As previously reported (25Chou C.H. Kim R.S. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3952-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), only a fraction of MCL-1 was resistant to alkaline extraction, and in contrast with total mitochondrial MCL-1, the amount of alkaline-resistant MCL-1 did not increase in the cells expressing Nt-MCL (Fig. 6, A and B). This suggests that Nt-MCL promotes the association of MCL-1 with mitochondria but not its insertion into the membrane. Again, the effects of Nt-MCL were not the consequence of an altered stability of MCL-1, as the degradation of endogenous MCL-1 after CHX or UV was the same in the presence or absence of Nt-MCL-V5, whereas the addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 could delay both CHX- and UV-induced degradation of endogenous MCL-1 (Fig. 5C).FIGURE 6Nt-MCL protects against UV-induced apoptosis. HeLa cells stably expressing Nt-MCL or the vector alone were treated with 200 mJ/cm2 UV in the presence of 50 μm zVAD-FMK. Cells were fixed after 4 h and analyzed for cyt c release by immunofluorescence. B, the same cells were treated with 200 mJ/cm2 and analyzed after 4 h for caspase-3-like activity using the substrate DEVD-p-nitroanilide. C, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Nt-MCL-GFP.

The increase in mitochondrial MCL-1 caused by the expression of Nt-MCL should, therefore, promote cell survival after apoptosis induction.

The role of the type I and II receptors in tumorigenesis has been extensively studied, but the role of the ubiquitously expressed type III receptor (TβRIII) remains elusive. We developed short hairpin RNAs directed against TβRIII to investigate the role of this receptor in breast cancer tumorigenesis. Nontumorigenic NMuMG mouse cells stably expressing short hairpin RNA specific to mouse TβRIII (NM-kd) demonstrated increased cell growth, motility, and invasion as compared with control cells expressing shRNA to human TβRIII (NM-con). Reconstitution of TβRIII expression with rat TβRIII abrogated the increased growth and motility seen in the NM-kd cells. In addition, the NM-kd cells exhibited marked reduction in the expression of the adherens junction protein, E-cadherin. This loss of E-cadherin was due to increased NFκB activity that, in turn, resulted in increased expression of the transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin such as Snail, Slug, Twist, and Sip1. Finally, NMuMG cells in which TβRIII had been knocked down formed invasive tumors in athymic nude mice, whereas the control cells did not.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). The three TGFβ isoforms (β1, β2, and β3) bind to transmembrane receptor serine/threonine kinases. TGFβ1 and TGFβ3 can bind with high affinity to the TGFβ type II receptor, resulting in activation of Smad 2/3 and downstream target genes. In contrast, TGFβ2 binds with low affinity to the type II receptor. The type III receptor (TβRIII), or betaglycan, binds with high affinity to all three TGFβ isoforms and is required for presenting TGFβ2 to the type II receptor (2Lopez-Casillas F. Kim J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). TβRIII has been shown to play an essential role in the formation of the atrioventricular cushion in the development of the heart (3Brown C.B. Kim A.S. Runyan R.B. Barnett J.V. Science. 1999; 283: 2080-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, the TβRIII null mouse is embryonically lethal because of heart and liver defects (4Stenvers K.L. Kim M.L. Harder K.W. Kountouri N. Amatayakul-Chantler S. Grail D. Small C. Weinberg R.A. Sizeland A.M. Zhu H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4371-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The role for TβRIII in cancer is less clear. Increased expression of TGFβ1 and all three TGFβ receptors was found in higher grade lymphomas (5Woszczyk D. Kim J. Jurzak M. Mazurek U. Mykala-Ciesla J. Wilczok T. Med. Sci. Monit. 2004; 10: CR33-CR37PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, reduced expression of TβRIII was found associated with advanced stage neuroblastomas and ovarian carcinomas (6Bristow R.E. Kim R.L. Yamada S.D. Korc M. Karlan B.Y. Cancer. 1999; 85: 658-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Iolascon A. Kim L. Borriello A. Carbone R. Izzo A. Tonini G.P. Gambini C. Della Ragione F. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Similarly, a recent report using cDNA microarrays demonstrated that low TβRIII expression correlates with higher grade among a cohort of breast cancers (8Dong M. Kim T. Kirkbride K.C. Gordon K.J. Lee J.D. Hempel N. Kelly P. Moeller B.J. Marks J.R. Blobe G.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Additionally, overexpression of TβRIII in MDA-231 human breast cancer cells and DU145 prostate cancer cells resulted in decreased tumor invasion in vitro and in vivo (9Turley R.S. Kim E.C. Hempel N. How T. Fields T.A. Blobe G.C. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10Sun L. Kim C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25367-25372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The reasons for this apparent contradictory role for TβRIII in these different tumor types have not been elucidated. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process by which TGFβ can promote tumorigenesis. EMT is characterized by a decrease in epithelial cell markers, such as E-cadherin and ZO-1, and an increase in mesenchymal markers including N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin. This is associated with a decrease in cell-cell adhesion and changes in the actin cytoskeleton. Loss of E-cadherin expression, either through genetic or epigenetic alterations, is the hallmark of EMT in epithelial cells. Several proteins (i.e. Snail, Slug, Twist, and Sip1) have been identified as transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin (11Vandewalle C. Kim J. De Craene B. Vermassen P. Bruyneel E. Andersen H.

NFκB is a family of hetero- or homodimeric transcription factors involved in cell survival and regulation of the immune response (14Wu J.T. Kim J.G. J. Surg. Res. 2005; 123: 158-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The NFκB signaling pathway appears to be a critical mediator of EMT (15Bachelder R.E. Kim S.O. Franci C. de Herreros A.G. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 16Vasko V. Kim A.V. Scouten W. He H. Auer H. Liyanarachchi S. Larin A. Savchenko V.

Additionally, it has been reported that NFκB is required for EMT during breast cancer progression (17Huber M.A. Kim N. Baumann B. Grunert S. Sommer A. Pehamberger H. Kraut N. Beug H. Wirth T. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). NFκB also appears to be a mediator of Snail expression (15Bachelder R.E. Kim S.O. Franci C. de Herreros A.G. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 18Kim H.J. Kim B.C. Cui X. Delgado D.A. Grabiner B.C. Lin X. Lewis M.T. Gottardis M.M. Wong T.W. Attar R.M. Carboni J.M. Lee A.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3165-3175Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A recent report demonstrated that expression of E-cadherin can down-regulate NFκB activity in melanoma cells, suggesting a direct link between these two pathways (19Kuphal S. Kim A.K. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The reported conflicting roles of TβRIII in tumorigenesis lead us to investigate its role in mammary cell transformation. For this purpose, we used a loss of function approach with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) specific to TβRIII in nontumorigenic NMuMG mammary epithelial cells. In this study we show that knock-down of TβRIII expression in NMuMG cells results in increased growth, motility, invasion, and tumor formation in vivo using a xenograft mouse model. In addition, we demonstrate that these changes are due to an increase in NFκB signaling that, in turn, results in transcriptional repression of E-cadherin. These results were not limited to NMuMG cells because we also observed a similar phenotype in EMT6 mouse mammary tumor cells in which TβRIII was knocked down by stable RNA interference. Cell Culture, Viral Infections, and shRNA—All of the cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). NMuMG cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Cambrex) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 μg/ml insulin. EMT-6, Phoenix-Ampho, and 293A cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. To generate retroviruses expressing short hairpin RNAs specific to mouse TβRIII, the complimentary oligonucleotides 5′-GAAAUGACAUCCCUUCCAC and 5′-GUGGAAGGGAUGUCAUUUG were annealed and ligated into the BglII/HindIII site of the pSuper vector. Retrovirus expressing shRNA specific to human TβRIII (5′-GAGAUGACAUUCCUUCAAC and 5′-GUUGAAGGAAUGUCAUCUC) was used as a control. The resulting pSuper plasmids were transfected into Phoenix-Ampho cells using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s directions. Supernatant containing viral particles was collected 72 h after transfection and filtered through a 20-μm syringe filter. Retrovirus containing mouse or human short hairpin RNA specific to the type III receptor were used to infect NMuMG cells in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). Stably expressing cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin. The pGEM-4Z rat TβRIII plasmid was a gift from Dr. Joan Massague (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). Rat TβRIII was digested out of pGEM-4Z using EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of the LZRS-MS-neo retroviral plasmid. NM-kd cells were infected with retrovirus containing rat TβRIII and selected using 600 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Adenovirus containing constitutively active IKK2 (CA-IKK2) or dominant negative IκBα (dn IκBα) were provided by Dr. Timothy Blackwell (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Adenovirus containing GFP was used as a vector control. 293A cells were infected with adenovirus to produce a concentrated stock of virions. For adenoviral infection, NMuMG cells were plated to ∼70% confluency in 100-mm dishes. Adenovirus was added to the cells in 3 ml of serum-free medium for 3 h, at which point 7 ml of medium containing 10% FBS was added. The cells were allowed to grow for 48 h before being subjected to further treatment. Antibodies and Reagents—TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Growth factor-reduced Matrigel was purchased from Clontech (Mountainview, CA). Antibodies to E-cadherin and Smad 2/3 were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); p-Smad 2 was from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); actin was from Sigma. Phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (actin) and goat anti mouse Oregon Green 488 antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies used for immunoblots were from Promega (Madison, WI). 125I-TGFβ1 Affinity Cross-linking Assays—125I-TGFβ1 affinity cross-linking assays were performed as described (20Dumont N. Kim A.V. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3275-3285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cross-linked cell lysates were separated on a 3-12% gradient SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. RNA Isolation and Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini-kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s directions. RNA (5 μg) was reverse transcribed in a 100-μl reaction. Quantitative PCR was carried out on 500 ng of cDNA using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix from Bio-Rad in a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ multicolor real time PCR detection system. Primers were designed using the Universal Probe Library from Roche Applied Science. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1. A standard curve was generated by amplifying known concentration of cDNA using actin primers. All of the reactions were performed in triplicate.TABLE 1Quantitative PCR primer sequencesNameSequenceMouse E-cadherin5′-AAT GGC GGC AAT GCA ATC CCA AGA5′-TGC CAC AGA CCG ATT GTG GAG ATAMouse Snail5′-TCC AAA CCC ACT CGG ATG TGA AGA5′-TTG GTG CTT GTG GAG CAA GGA CATMouse Slug5′-CAC ATT CGA ACC CAC ACA TTG CCT5′-TGT GCC CTC AGG TTT GAT CTG TCTMouse Sip15′-ATG GCA ACA CAT GGG TTT AGT GGC5′-ATT GGA CTC TGA GCA GAT GGG TGTMouse Twist5′-AAT TCA CAA GAA TCA GGG CGT GGG5′-TCT ATC AGA ATG CAG AGG TGT GGGActin5′-GGG GTG TTG AAG GTC TCA AA5′-AGA AAA TCT GGC ACC CC Open table in a new tab Cell Growth and Motility Assays—The cells (1 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well plates in medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were harvested every other day for 7 days, and the cell numbers in each well were measured using a Coulter Counter. Three-dimensional growth assays were carried out in growth factor reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) as described (21Xiang B. Kim S.K. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 406: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cells were dissolved from the Matrigel using Cell Recovery Solution (BD Biosciences), and their numbers were measured in a Coulter Counter. For motility assays, confluent sheets of cells were “wounded” by scraping with a pipette tip at time of treatment. Wound closure in the presence of added ligand was assessed over time as described previously (22Wang S.E. Kim F.Y. Shin I. Qu S. Arteaga C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4703-4715Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transwell assays were performed as previously described (23Bakin A.V. Kim A.K. Bhowmick N.A. Moses H.L. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36803-36810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells (1.5 × 105/well) were plated in serum-free medium in the upper chamber of 8-μm transwells (Costar) and incubated with or without 2 ng/ml TGFβ. After 24 h, cells that had migrated to the underside of the transwell filters were fixed and stained utilizing Diff-Quick Stain Set from Dade Behring AG (Dudingen, Switzerland). The cells in five random fields at 200× magnification were counted. Immunoblot Analysis—The cells were plated in 60-mm plates and allowed to grow overnight. The cells were then placed in low serum medium (1% FBS) for 16 h, after which the medium was replaced with low serum medium containing either 2 ng/ml TGFβ1 or TGFβ2 for 6 h. The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF) as previously described (22Wang S.E. Kim F.Y. Shin I. Qu S. Arteaga C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4703-4715Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce); 50 μg of protein was separated by 9% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by incubation with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times in TBST, and the bands were visualized using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Transcriptional Reporter Assays—The cells were seeded in 60-mm plates and transfected with 5 μg of either 3TP-Lux (provided by Dr. Joan Massague, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center), NFκB-Luc (provided by Dr. Timothy Blackwell, Vanderbilt University), E-cad-Luc (provided by Dr. Amparo Cano, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain), or 0.5 μg pCMV-Renilla (Promega) using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The next day, the cells were split equally into 48-well plates and incubated overnight in DMEM, 1% FBS, after which the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM, 1% FBS containing either 2 ng/ml TGFβ1 or TGF β2 for 24 h. Firefly luciferase and Renilla reniformis luciferase activity was measured using a dual luciferase reporter system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s published protocol in a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). ELISAs—Serum-free conditioned medium was removed from growing cells after 72 h and tested using the TGFβ1 or the TGFβ2 Quantikine ELISA kit (R & D Systems) following acid activation as indicated in the manufacturer’s protocol. A standard curve using 31.5-2,000 pg/ml human recombinant TGFβ was generated using the kit reagents and used to calculate the TGFβ equivalents in the conditioned medium. Each sample was examined in triplicate for a total of three times as described (24Biswas S. Kim M. Rinehart C. Dugger T.C. Chytil A. Moses H.L. Freeman M.L. Arteaga C.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). All of the ELISA data are corrected for cell number (pg/ml/cell number). Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Immunofluorescent microscopy was performed as previously described (23Bakin A.V. Kim A.K. Bhowmick N.A. Moses H.L. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36803-36810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown in 8-well chamber slides for 48 h, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, incubated with either phalloidin (1:40 dilution) or E-cadherin (1:500 dilution) primary antibodies for 1 h, and then incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies for 30 min. Fluorescent images were captured using a Princeton Instruments cooled CCD digital camera from a Zeiss Axio-phot upright microscope. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using the Promega Gel Shift Assay Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. NM-con and NM-kd cells were grown in DMEM, 1% FBS in the presence or absence of 2 ng/ml TGFβ2 for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were harvested as described previously (25Schreiber E. Kim P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with 32P-labeled NFκB oligonucleotides, separated by 6% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. Unlabeled NFκB oligonucleotides (cold NFκB) were used as a competitive inhibitor, and unlabeled Oct-1 oligonucleotides were used as a negative control. Xenograft Assays—The cells (1 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and injected with a 22-gauge needle into the right inguinal mammary gland (number 4) of anesthetized 6-week old athymic nude mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) and allowed to grow for 10 weeks. Fat pads, tumors, and lungs were collected, fixed in 10% formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Knock-down of TβRIII in NMuMG Cells Impairs Response to TGFβ—We developed shRNAs specific to TβRIII to determine the role of this receptor in mammary epithelial cells. Nontumorigenic NMuMG mouse epithelial cells were infected with a virus containing the shRNA specific to human (NM-con) or mouse (NM-kd) TβRIII, and individual clones were isolated through serial dilution. The clones were initially screened using semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR with primers designed to amplify TβRIII and actin (data not shown). Positive clones were confirmed by receptor cross-linking with 125I-TGFβ1. As a control, mouse NMuMG cells were also infected with shRNA to human TβRIII. Affinity cross-linking with 125I-TGFβ1 showed loss of the type III receptor protein only in NM-kd cells but not in cells transduced with the control shRNA specific to human TβRIII (Fig. 1A). To determine the effect of TβRIII knock-down on TGFβ signaling, we examined p-Smad2 by Western blot after TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 treatment. NM-kd cells had significantly reduced p-Smad2 levels after treatment with 2 ng/ml TGFβ2 compared with control cells (Fig. 1B). Additionally, the ability of the NM-kd cells to activate the 3TP-Lux TGFβ-responsive promoter after TGFβ treatment was markedly inhibited, whereas reconstitution of the receptor with a retrovirus encoding rat TβRIII (NM-kd&RIII) restored ligand-induced 3TP-Lux reporter activity (Fig. 1C). The transduced rat TβRIII was also detectable by affinity cross-linking with 125I-TGFβ1 (Fig. 1A). Knock-down of TβRIII in NMuMG Cells Results in Increased Growth, Motility, and Invasiveness—TGFβ is an inhibitor of epithelial cell growth (26Siegel P.M. Kim J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined proliferation and migration of cells in which TβRIII has been reduced by RNA interference. NM-kd cells grew significantly faster than NM-con cells, and re-expression of rat TβRIII in the NM-kd cells reduced their growth rate (Fig. 2A). Additionally, the NM-kd cells were able to migrate and close a wound in a wound closure assay under reduced serum conditions, whereas control cells and NM-kd cells reconstituted with TβRIII did not close the wound (Fig. 2B). The NM-kd cells were also more invasive than the NM-con cells as determined by their ability to migrate through transwell filters in the presence of low serum. TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 inhibited transwell migration of control cells but not of the NM-kd cells (Fig. 2C). This result is consistent with the dampened transcriptional response to added ligands observed in NM-kd cells (Fig. 1C). NMuMG cells are nontumorigenic and form small rounded acini when grown in Matrigel. In contrast, the NM-kd cells form invasive branching structures in three-dimensional Matrigel (Fig. 2D). Reconstitution of TβRIII abrogated the ability of the NM-kd cells to form these structures in Matrigel. To determine whether the changes in observed cell behavior could involve the production of autocrine ligands, we investigated the secretion of TGFβ ligands by NMuMG cells. ELISAs were used to determine the amount of total TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 secreted from these cells. The NM-kd cells secret significantly less TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 compared with control cells (Fig. 2E). Loss of TβRIII Results in Down-regulation of E-cadherin—The increased motility and invasiveness of the NM-kd cells was suggestive of EMT. Changes in the content and localization of E-cadherin at adherent cell junctions is a hallmark of EMT (27Thiery J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses, real time quantitative PCR, and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the NM-kd cells express greatly reduced levels of E-cadherin (Fig. 3, A-C). The ability of the NM-kd cells to transcriptionally activate an E-cadherin promoter luciferase reporter was also diminished as compared with NM-con cells (Fig. 3D). E-cadherin promoter activity is restored in the NM-kd&RIII cells, where the type III receptor had been re-expressed. The E-cadherin gene can be regulated by a variety of mechanisms including epigenetic changes, such as hypermethylation, as well as transcriptional repression. Therefore, we examined the mRNA levels of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors Snail, Slug, Sip1, and Twist by quantitative PCR. mRNA levels of Snail, Slug, Sip1, and Twist were significantly increased in NM-kd cells compared with NM-con cells (Fig. 4). This increase correlated with the reduced expression of E-cadherin (Fig. 3). Further, E-cadherin expression was restored with a corresponding decrease in Snail, Slug, Twist, and Sip1 in NM-kd&RIII cells. These data suggest a role for TβRIII in maintaining the epithelial phenotype through control of the transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin. EMT-6 Cells, with Reduced Expression of TβRIII, Demonstrated an Increased Growth Rate and Decreased E-cadherin Expression—To confirm that these results were specific to loss of TβRIII expression and not specific to NMuMG cells or caused by clonal variation, we knocked down TβRIII expression in EMT-6 mouse mammary cancer cells. EMT6-con and EMT6-kd cell lines were generated as described for the NMuMG cells (Fig. 1). The clones were screened by semi-quantitative PCR (Fig. 5A), and EMT6-kd clone C5 was used in the remaining experiments. The EMT6-kd cells demonstrated a muted response to TGFβ2, but not TGFβ1, as determined by 3TP-Lux reporter assays (Fig. 5B). Similar to NMuMG cells, EMT6-kd cells grew better in Matrigel compared with EMT6-con cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, these cells showed decreased E-cadherin protein expression and E-cadherin luciferase activity (Fig. 5, D and E) with a corresponding increase in Snail mRNA (Fig. 5E). These data demonstrate that the effect of TβRIII loss on growth and E-cadherin expression is not limited to NNuMG cells. NFκB Activity Is Higher in TβRIII Knock-down Cells—NFκB is a known regulator of Snail (28Barbera M.J. Kim I. Dominguez D. Julien-Grille S. Guaita-Esteruelas S. Peiro S. Baulida J. Franci C. Dedhar S. Larue L. Garcia de Herreros A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7345-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and NFκB activity has been shown to be regulated (positively and negatively) by TGFβ2 (29Lu T. Kim L.G. Swiatkowski S.M. Boiko A.D. Howe P.H. Stark G.R. Gudkov A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7112-7117Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Kaltschmidt B. Kim C. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined NFκB activity using a NFκB-responsive luciferase reporter in transiently transfected NMuMG cells. The NM-kd cells showed high basal levels of NFκB reporter activity as compared with NM-con cells. Re-expression of the type III receptor in NM-kd cells reduced NFκB transcription to the same levels as those seen in NM-con cells (Fig. 6A). The ability of NFκB to bind to DNA was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using 32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing the putative NFκB-binding site (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, TGFβ2 blocked DNA binding in both cell lines. To examine the role of NFκB in the invasive phenotype seen in the NM-kd cells, we used an adenovirus containing either dominant negative IκBα (dn IκBα S32A/S36A) to abrogate NFκB function or a constitutively active IKK2 (CA-IKK2 D177E/D181E) to induce NFκB signaling. NM-kd and NM-con cells were transduced with adenoviruses, plated in growth factor reduced Matrigel 24 h later, and allowed to grow for 8 days. NM-kd cells infected with dn IκBα containing adenovirus showed a significant reduction of growth in Matrigel (Fig. 6, C and D). Transduction of adenoviruses encoding dn IκBα into NM-kd cells significantly diminished NFκB promoter activity. On the other hand, NM-kd cells infected with CA-IKK2 showed a significant increase in NFκB reporter activity that was not seen in NM-control cells (Fig. 6, E and F). This result implies that the endogenous type III TGFβ receptor may counteract the NFκB-inducing effect of CA-IKK2. It is significant to note that the reduction in NFκB activity did not reduce the ability of the NM-kd cells to grow in Matrigel down to that of the NM-con cells and that these cells still retain their invasive phenotype, suggesting the involvement of additional signaling pathways on the cells invasive behavior. The decreased ability to grow in Matrigel corresponded to a significant increase in base-line E-cadherin promoter activity in NM-con versus NM-kd cells. Infection with an adenovirus containing dn IκBα up-regulated the low basal E-cadherin promoter activity in NM-kd but not in NM-con cells (Fig. 7, A and C). Additionally, NM-con cells infected with adenovirus containing constitutively active IKK2 showed a decrease in E-cadherin promoter reporter activity (Fig. 7, A and B), consistent with the role of NFκB signaling on EMT. In accordance with these results, E-cadherin mRNA, as measured by quantitative PCR, is significantly increased in NM-kd cells transduced with dn IκBα (Fig. 7C) with a corresponding decrease in Snail (Fig. 7D).

These observations suggest that in the molecular mechanism of photosynthetic hydrogen evolution (i) the light reaction is at least 60 percent as efficient as the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction as measured by the ability to utilize absorbed visible quanta, and (ii) there are no sequential, photoproduced, metastable intermediates as there are in the case of oxygen evolution. Therefore, a minimum of two reducing equivalents from two different photosystems must have access to a common pool in producing molecular hydrogen if these photosystems each produce one electron per single-turnover flash."

https://openalex.org/W1986513818,"The opening of ion channels is proposed to arise from bending of the pore inner helices that enables them to pivot away from the central axis creating a cytosolic opening for ion diffusion. The flexibility of the inner helices is suggested to occur either at a conserved glycine located adjacent to the selectivity filter (glycine gating hinge) and/or at a second site occupied by glycine or proline containing motifs. Sequence alignment with other K+ channels shows that hERG possesses glycine residues (Gly648 and Gly657) at each of these putative hinge sites. In apparent contrast to the hinge hypotheses, substitution of both glycine residues for alanine causes little effect on either the voltage-dependence or kinetics of channel activation, and open state block by intracellular blockers. Substitution of the glycines with larger hydrophobic residues causes a greater propensity for the channel to open. We propose that in contrast to Shaker the pore of hERG is intrinsically more stable in the open than the closed conformation and that substitution at Gly648 or Gly657 further shifts the gating equilibrium to favor the open state. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate the S6 helices of hERG are inherently flexible, even in the absence of the glycine residues. Thus hERG activation gating exhibits important differences to other Kv channels. Our findings indicate that the hERG inner helix glycine residues are required for the tight packing of the channel helices and that the flexibility afforded by glycine or proline residues is not universally required for activation gating."

Earlier we have demonstrated that myelin basic protein (MBP)-primed T cells induce the expression of various proinflammatory molecules in glial cells via cell-to-cell contact. Here we describe that after Th2 polarization by gemfibrozil or other drugs, MBP-primed T cells induced the expression of neurotrophic molecules such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), but not proinflammatory molecules in microglia and astroglia via cell-to-cell contact. MBP-primed Th2 cells expressed α5 and β3 integrins and functional blocking antibodies against both α5 and β3 integrins inhibited the ability of MBP-primed Th2 cells to induce glial neurotrophins. On the other hand, glial cells expressed PDGF-Rβ and neutralization of this glial receptor abrogated the ability of Th2 cells to induce neurotrophins in glia. Activation of glial cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) by MBP-primed Th2 cell contact and inhibition of contact-mediated expression of neurotrophins by antisense knockdown of glial CREB suggest that MBP-primed Th2 cell-glia contact induces the expression of neurotrophins through glial activation of CREB. Accordingly, blocking of either α5β3 integrins on T cells or PDGF-Rβ on glial cells impaired the ability of MBP-primed Th2 cells to induce glial activation of CREB. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these MBP-primed Th2 cells entered into the central nervous system and increased the expression of neurotrophins in vivo in the brain. This study illuminates the importance of α5β3 and PDGF-Rβ in guiding the novel neurotrophic property of neuroantigen-primed T cells via activation of CREB that may be of therapeutic importance in various neurological disorders.

This study illuminates the importance of α5β3 and PDGF-Rβ in guiding the novel neurotrophic property of neuroantigen-primed T cells via activation of CREB that may be of therapeutic importance in various neurological disorders. Neurotrophins are a family of molecules that stimulate and control neurogenesis and support the survival of existing neurons. Some neurotrophins also support proliferation and differ-entiation of oligodendroglial progenitors and normal health of oligodendrocytes (1Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Kim C. Chao M.V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 468: 275-282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Althaus H.H. Prog. Brain Res. 2004; 146: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistently, in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders, which are hallmarked by the loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes, neurotrophins have been suggested as rescuers of these vulnerable cells. Various neurotrophic molecules including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), 2The abbreviations used are: BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; MBP, myelin basic protein; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; NT-3, neurotrophin-3; CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; CNS, central nervous system; BBB, blood brain barrier; IL, interleukin; PDGF-Rβ, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.2The abbreviations used are: BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; MBP, myelin basic protein; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; NT-3, neurotrophin-3; CREB, cAMP response element binding protein; CNS, central nervous system; BBB, blood brain barrier; IL, interleukin; PDGF-Rβ, platelet-derived growth factor receptor β; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) exhibit protective effects in cell culture models of different neurodegenerative disorders (3Spina M.B.

However, clinical application of those molecules has been limited because of difficulties in delivery. These peptides do not readily diffuse across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or ventricular lining and have limited or unstable bioavailability (6Kordower J.H. Kim S. Chen E.Y. Ma S.Y. Sendera T. Cochran E.J. Cochran E.J. Mufson E.J. Penn R. Goetz C.G. Comella C.D. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Gene delivery by stereotactic injection is definitely an option but it has several limitations. It seems from the therapeutic angle, the best option is to stimulate/induce the production of neurotrophic factors within the CNS of patients with neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. Although neurons produce neurotrophins under physiological conditions, it is glial cells (microglia and astroglia) that produce neurotrophins under pathophysiological conditions. Therefore, understanding the mechanism by which neurotrophic factors are generated in glial cells is an important area of research. The presence of neuroantigen-primed T cells recognizing self-myelin antigens within the CNS is necessary for the development of demyelinating disease like multiple sclerosis (MS). Because of antigen specificity, these cells move toward the CNS, cross the BBB and initiate inflammatory disease in the CNS of MS patients. Recently we have shown that myelin basic protein (MBP)-primed T cells induce microglial expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-1α, TNF-α, and IL-6) through cell-cell contact (7Dasgupta S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 22424-22431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is to be noted that not only the proinflammatory molecules but also the neurotrophic factors may be released from microglia and astroglia upon activation (9Saha R.N. Kim K. J. Neuroimmune Pharmacol. 2006; 1: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, molecular pathways that may redirect activated glial cells to secrete neurotrophic factors, not proinflammatory molecules, have been poorly defined. Here we describe a novel mechanism to stimulate the release of neurotrophic factors from microglia and astroglia. After Th2 polarization by gemfibrozil, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, or other immunomodulatory drugs, MBP-primed Th2 cells induced the expression of neurotrophic factors in both microglia and astroglia. We also demonstrate for the first time that α5β3 integrin on the T cell surface and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGF-Rβ) on glial cells played an important role in Th2 cell contact-mediated glial expression of neurotrophins through the regulation of glial activation of CREB. Furthermore, these gemfibrozil-modified MBP-primed Th2 cells entered into the CNS and increased the expression of neurotrophins in vivo in the CNS. Reagents—Fetal bovine serum, Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), DMEM/F-12, RPMI 1640, l-glutamine, and β-mercaptoethanol were purchased from Mediatech. Gemfibrozil and sodium phenylacetate was obtained from Sigma. Mouse recombinant IL-4 was obtained from R&D. Antibodies against mouse IL-12, FITC-labeled, and functional blocking antibodies against α4, α5, β1, and β3 integrins were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Functional blocking antibodies against PDGF-Rβ and VEGF-R were purchased from eBioscience. Bovine myelin basic protein was purchased from Invitrogen. Isolation of MBP-primed T cells—MBP-primed T cells were isolated from lymph nodes of MBP-immunized mice as described earlier (7Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22424-22431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, female SJL/J mice were immunized s.c. with 400 μg of bovine MBP and 60 μg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37RA; Difco Labs.) in IFA (Calbiochem). Lymph nodes were collected from these mice, and the single cell suspension was prepared in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at a concentration of 4–5 × 106 cells/ml in 6-well plates. Cells isolated from MBP-immunized mice were incubated with 50 μg/ml of MBP in the presence or absence of gemfibrozil or sodium phenylacetate for 4 days. Isolation of Mouse Primary Astroglia and Microglia—Microglia and astroglia were isolated from mixed glial cultures of 7-day-old mouse pups according to the procedure of Guilian and Baker (10Giulian D. Kim T.J. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 2163-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described earlier (8Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22424-22431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Roy A. Kim Y.K. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14971-14980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, on day 7 to 9 days of culture, the mixed glial cultures were washed three times with DMEM/F-12 and subjected to a shake at 240 rpm for 2 h at 37 °C on a rotary shaker. While floating cells were used to purify microglia, adherent cells were shaken again on day 11 to remove residual microglia, and more than ninety-eight percent of adherent cells were positive for astroglial marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). On the other hand, floating cells were washed and allowed to adhere on tissue culture dishes at 37 °C for 30 min. 90–95 percent of adhered cells was found to be positive for Mac-1 surface antigen. Stimulation of Glial Cells by MBP-primed T Cell Contact—Primary glial cells were stimulated with different concentrations of MBP-primed T cells under serum-free conditions. After 1 h of incubation, culture dishes were shaken and washed three times with HBSS to lower the concentration of T cells. Earlier we have shown by FACS analysis of adherent microglial cells using FITC-labeled anti-CD3 antibodies that more than 80% T cells were removed from microglial cells by this procedure (7Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Labeling of T cells with Alexa 680-SE NIR Dye for Cell Tracking—T cells were labeled with Alexa 680-SE NIR dye (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the dye was initially dissolved with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium to prepare 1 mm stock and stored at -20 °C under moisture-free conditions. The dye was diluted to 15–20 μm in pre-warmed (37 °C) PBS just before the beginning of the experiment. T cells were washed and suspended in pre-warmed PBS containing Alexa 680 and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were washed five times to remove free dye and resuspended in PBS again. Labeled MBP-primed T cells (107 cells/mouse) were transferred to naïve female SJL/J mice through the tail vein (12Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Zhou Y. Banik N.L. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3874-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Dasgupta S. Kim M. Zhou Y. Fung Y.K. Ghosh S. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After 5 days injection, the movement of T cells was detected by scanning mice in Odyssey (ODY-0854, Licor-Inc) infra-red scanner at a 700-nm channel. Immunocytochemistry—After 5 days transfer of T cells, mice were perfused with PBS (pH 7.4) and then with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde solution in PBS followed by dissection of the cerebellum from each mouse for immunofluorescence microscopy (12Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Zhou Y. Banik N.L. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3874-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Dasgupta S. Kim M. Zhou Y. Fung Y.K. Ghosh S. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were incubated in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), 10% sucrose for 3 h and then 30% sucrose overnight at 4 °C. Cerebellar tissues were then embedded in O.C.T (Tissue Tech) at -80 °C, and processed for conventional cryosectioning. Frozen sections (10 μm) were treated with cold ethanol (-20 °C) followed by two rinses in PBS. Samples were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBST and incubated in PBST-BSA and primary antibodies. For double-labeling, tissue sections were incubated with rabbit anti-BDNF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:200) along with one of the following antibodies: rat anti-mouse CD11b (Chemicon) (1:200), goat anti-GFAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:200), and goat anti-CD3 (BIOSOURCE International) (1:200). After three washes in PBST, sections were further incubated with Cy2 and Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). For negative controls, a set of sections was incubated under similar conditions without the primary antibodies. The samples were mounted and observed under a Bio-Rad MRC1024ES confocal laser scanning microscope. The number of T cells was counted in cerebellar sections in an Olympus IX81 fluorescence microscope using MicroSuite™ imaging software, version five. Th2 Conditioning of MBP-primed T Cells—For Th2 conditioning, cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml MBP in the presence of 3 μg/ml anti-IL-12 (R&D) and 100 ng/ml IL-4 (R&D) as described earlier (13Dasgupta S. Kim M. Zhou Y. Fung Y.K. Ghosh S. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Following 4 days of incubation, supernatants were collected to assay IFN-γ and IL-10. Isolation of Plasma Membranes of MBP-primed T Cells—Plasma membranes of MBP-primed and gemfibrozil-treated MBP-primed T cells were prepared by sonication and centrifugation as described earlier (14Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32609-32617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were broken up by sonication, and the nuclear fraction was discarded after centrifugation for 10 min at 4,000 × g. The supernatant were centrifuged for 45 min at 100,000 × g. The pellet of T cell membranes was resuspended at 50 × 106 cell equivalents/ml by sonication in HBSS containing 20 μm EDTA and 5 μm iodoacetamide. Then microglial cells were stimulated by plasma membranes (0.5:1 of T cells:microglia) in serum-free DMEM/F-12. Assay for NO Synthesis—Culture supernatants were assayed for nitrite, a stable reaction product of NO with molecular oxygen, using Griess reagent as described earlier (7Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Roy A. Kim Y.K. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol.

Assay for TNF-α and IL-1β Synthesis—Concentrations of TNF-α and IL-1β were measured in culture supernatants by a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction as described earlier (8Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22424-22431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol.

Assay for BDNF and NT-3 Synthesis—Concentrations of BDNF and NT-3 were measured in culture supernatants by a high sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. RNA Isolation and Semi-quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—It was performed as described earlier (13Dasgupta S. Kim M. Zhou Y. Fung Y.K. Ghosh S. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Jana M. Kim K. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using a RT-PCR kit from Clontech and the following primer sequences: BDNF, sense: 5′-AGG CAA CTT GGC CTA CCC AGG TGT G-3′ and antisense: 5′-TAC TGT CAC ACA CGC TCA GCT CCC C-3′; NT-3, sense: 5′-CTC CAT GAG CTT TGT ACA AGG-3′ and antisense: 5′-TGC TGA TGT ACC AGT TGG GG-3′; PDGFR-α, sense: 5′-TTA CCC TCT ATC CTC CCA AAC GA-3′ and antisense: 5′-GGG CAG CAC ATT CAT ACT CTC C-3′; PDGFR-β, sense: 5′-ATT CCG TGC CGA GTG ACA GAC CC-3′ and antisense: 5′-AGT AGC CCG CTT CTG ACA CCT T-3′; GAPDH, sense: 5′-GGT GAA GGT CGG TGT GAA CG-3′ and antisense: 5′-TTG GCT CCA CCC TTC AAG TG-3′. Analysis of Different Integrins by Gene Array—Expression of different integrins was analyzed in MBP-primed Th1 and Th2 cells by a RT-PCR-based gene array kit (GEArray™) from SuperArray, Inc. following the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCR Analysis—It was performed using the ABI-Prism7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) as described earlier (13Dasgupta S. Kim M. Zhou Y. Fung Y.K. Ghosh S. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Jana M. Kim K. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All primers and FAM-labeled probes for mouse BDNF, NT-3 and GAPDH were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Assay of Transcriptional Activity of CREB—Astrocytes plated at 50–60% confluence in 12-well plates were cotransfected with 0.25 μg of pCRE-Luc (CREB-dependent reporter construct) and 12.5 ng of pRL-TK (a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase; Promega) using Lipofectamine-Plus (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were stimulated with Th1 and Th2 cells. After 1 h of stimulation, culture dishes were shaken and washed three times with HBSS to lower the T cell concentration. Then adherent astrocytes were incubated with serum-free media for 5 h followed by analysis of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities as described earlier (16Jana M. Kim X. Koka S. Ghosh S. Petro T.M. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44527-44533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). MBP-primed Th1, but Not Th2, Cells Induced the Expression of Proinflammatory Molecules in Mouse Primary Microglia by Cell-to-Cell Contact—MBP-primed T cells isolated from MBP-immunized mice released high amounts of IFN-γ (a Th1 cytokine) and very little IL-4 and IL-10 (Th2 cytokines) (Fig. 1A). For switching toward Th2, we used gemfibrozil (gem) that has been reported to favor the differentiation of neuroantigen-primed T cells toward the Th2 mode (17Lovett-Racke A.E. Kim R.Z. Northrop S. Choy J. Rocchini A. Matthes L. Chavis J.A. Diab A. Drew P.D. Racke M.K. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5790-5798Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and sodium phenylacetate (NaPA) that has been shown to suppress the adoptive transfer of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) (12Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Zhou Y. Banik N.L. Pahan K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3874-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both drugs suppressed the production of IFN-γ and stimulated the production of IL-4 and IL-10 (Th2 cytokines) by MBP-primed T cells (Fig. 1A). As expected, after Th2 conditioning in the presence of IL-4 and anti-IL-12, MBP-primed T cells also produced less IFN-γ (a Th1 cytokine) and more IL-10 (a Th2 cytokine) compared with untreated MBP-primed T cells (Fig. 1A). As shown earlier in several studies (7Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39327-39333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22424-22431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), these MBP-primed Th1 cells induced the production of NO (Fig. 1B) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α) (Fig. 1C) in mouse primary microglia via cell-to-cell contact. Although there was also very little or no induction of NO, IL-1β and TNF-α production when MBP-primed Th1 cells were added to microglia at a ratio of 0.1:1, marked induction of these proinflammatory molecules was observed at the ratio of 0.2:1 of T cell:microglia (Fig. 1, B and C). The induction of proinflammatory molecule production increased slightly further at higher ratios of T cell: microglia (Fig. 1, B and C). However, normal T cells (isolated from normal mice) were unable to induce the production of NO, IL-1β, and TNF-α in primary microglia (data not shown). Interestingly, after gem treatment, gem-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells did not induce the production of NO, IL-1β, and TNF-α in microglia (Fig. 1, B and C). Similarly, semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis also showed that MBP-primed Th1 but not Th2 cells induced the expression of iNOS, IL-1β, and TNF-α mRNAs in microglia (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that Th1 to Th2 switching inhibits the ability of MBP-primed T cells to induce contact-mediated expression of proinflammatory molecules in mouse primary microglia. Both MBP-primed Th1 and Th2 Cells Produced BDNF and NT-3—It has been shown that copaxone-1 (Cop-1)-specific Th1 and Th2 cells release BDNF (18Aharoni R. Kim B. Eilam R. Sela M. Arnon R. Proc. Natl.

Furthermore, Th1 and Th2 cell lines specific for myelin antigens also produce increased amount of BDNF after antigen stimulation (21Kerschensteiner M. Kim E. Behrens L. Leal V.V. Misgeld T. Klinkert W.E. Kolbeck R. Hoppe E. Oropeza-Wekerle R.L. Bartke I. Stadelmann C. Lassmann H. Wekerle H. Hohlfeld R. J. Exp.

As observed in Fig. 2, MBP-primed Th1 cells, gem-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells, NaPA-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells, and (IL-4+anti-IL-12)-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells produced BDNF and NT-3. MBP-primed Th2, but Not Th1, Cells Induced the Production of BDNF and NT-3 in Mouse Primary Microglia and Astroglia by Cell-to-Cell Contact—Next we investigated if these MBP-primed Th1 and Th2 cells were capable of inducing the expression of neurotrophic factors in microglia and astroglia. Normal T cells, MBP-primed Th1 cells, gem-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells, (IL-4+anti-IL-12)-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells, (gem+IL-4+anti-IL-12)-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells, and NaPA-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells were washed and added to mouse primary microglia in direct contact. After 1 h of contact, culture dishes were shaken and washed three times to remove MBP-primed T cells. Normal T cells (isolated from normal mice) did not induce the expression of BDNF and NT-3 in microglia at various ratios of T cell:microglia (data not shown). Although MBP-primed Th1 cells produced BDNF and NT-3 (Fig. 2), these cells were unable to induce the expression of BDNF and NT-3 in microglia after 1 h of contact (Fig. 3A). However, under similar conditions, gem-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells markedly induced the expression of BDNF and NT-3 in primary microglia (Fig. 3A). Similarly (IL-4+anti-IL-12)-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells, (gem+IL-4+anti-IL-12)-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells, and NaPA-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells also induced the expression of BDNF and NT-3 in microglia (Fig. 3A). Real-time PCR data also support that gem-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells but not MBP-primed Th1 cells induced the expression of BDNF and NT-3 in microglia at different ratios of T cell:microglia (Fig. 3B). To understand the protein level of these neurotrophins, we performed ELISA. It is apparent from Fig. 3C that these gem-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells were poor inducers of neurotrophin production at 0.1:1 of T cell:microglia. But marked induction of BDNF and NT-3 production was observed at the ratio of 0.2:1 of T cell:microglia (Fig. 3C). The induction of microglial neurotrophin production increased further at higher ratios, such as at 0.5:1 or 0.7:1 of T cell:microglia (Fig. 3C). The time-dependent experiment using gem-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells in the ratio of 0.5:1 of T cell:microglia showed that the microglial induction of BDNF and NT-3 production peaked at 24 h of incubation (data not shown). Similarly, gem-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells, NaPA-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells and (IL-4+anti-IL-12)-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells but not MBP-primed Th1 cells also induced the expression of BDNF and NT-3 in mouse primary astroglia (Fig. 3D). Because all different populations of Th2 cells behave similarly with respect to neurotrophin production in glia, we used gem-treated MBP-primed Th2 cells for further studies. Next we examined if the contact between Th2 cells and glial cells or the soluble factors produced from these T cells is necessary for the induction of BDNF and NT-3 production. First, these T cells were placed in a culture insert, where they were in close proximity to, but not contacting microglia. In contrast to marked induction of BDNF and NT-3 production (Fig. 3C) and mRNA expression (Fig. 3, A and B) by Th2 cell:microglia contact, very little neurotrophin production (Fig. 4B) and mRNA expression (Fig. 4A) was observed when Th2 cells were placed within culture inserts. Second, different amount of the conditioned supernatant of Th2 cells were added to primary microglia. Fifty microliters of supernatant was equivalent to T cells sufficient for the ratio of 0.5:1 of T cell:microglia. The induction of both BDNF and NT-3 production by 50 μl of that supernatant (Fig. 4C) was very low (<6%) as compared with that by 0.5:1 of Th2 cell:microglia (Fig. 3C). Higher volumes of supernatants of Th2 cells also did not induce higher amount of BDNF and NT-3 in microglia (Fig. 4C). To further prove that it is a contact-mediated effect, we isolated plasma membranes of Th1 and Th2 cells and added to microglia. Plasma membranes of Th2 cells but not Th1 cells induced the expression of BDNF and NT-3 mRNA (Fig. 4D) and protein (Fig. 4E) in mouse primary microglia. Taken together, although both MBP-primed Th1 and Th2 cells produced BDNF and NT-3 (Fig. 2), only Th2 but not Th1 cells were able to induce contact-mediated expression of neurotrophins in glial cells. Identification of Contact Molecules on MBP-primed Th2 Cells and Glia Responsible for Glial Expression of Neurotrophins—Integrins being present on cell surface are mainly involved in integrating cell-cell interaction. Earlier we have found that α4β1 integrin heterodimer on the surface of MBP-primed Th1 cells is involved in Th1 cell contact-induced expression of proinflammatory molecules in microglia (8Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22424-22431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Dasgupta S. Kim M. Liu X. Pahan K. J. Biol.

Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of integrins in neurotrophic activity of MBP-primed Th2 cells. At first, we performed a RT-PCR-based targeted gene array analysis (Superarray) to understand the status of various integrins in Th1 and Th2 cells. It is clearly evident from Fig. 5, A and B that the expression of α3, α5, α8, β1, β2, and β4 in Th2 cells was higher than Th1 cells. On the other hand, the expression of α2, αe, α4, α7, α9, and αV was higher in Th1 cells than Th2 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). We also verified the expression"

We found that the nonreceptor Tec family tyrosine kinase Bmx/Etk was activated by tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of Src and PI 3-kinase in PTEN-deficient LNCaP and PC3 PCa cells and that Bmx down-regulation by short interfering RNA markedly inhibited LNCaP cell growth. Bmx also associated with ErbB3 in LNCaP cells, and heregulin-β1 enhanced this interaction and further stimulated Bmx activity. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) similarly stimulated an interaction between Bmx and EGF receptor and rapidly increased Bmx kinase activity. Bmx stimulation in response to heregulin-β1 and EGF was Src-dependent, and heregulin-β1 stimulation of Bmx was also PI 3-kinase-dependent. In contrast, the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Bmx in response to EGF was PI 3-kinase-independent. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Bmx is a critical downstream target of the constitutively active PI 3-kinase in PTEN-deficient PCa cells and further show that Bmx is recruited by the EGF receptor and ErbB3 and activated in response to their respective ligands. Therefore, Bmx may be a valuable therapeutic target in PCa and other epithelial malignancies in which PI 3-kinase or EGF receptor family pathways are activated. Pathways activated downstream of constitutively active phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer (PCa) cells are possible therapeutic targets.

Luo J. Cantley L.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 606-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar). This PI 3-kinase pathway is negatively regulated by PTEN, which functions as a PIP3 phosphatase. PTEN loss and subsequent activation of PI 3-kinase signaling makes a major contribution to prostate cancer (PCa), with a large fraction of metastatic PCa and many high grade primary PCa being PTEN-deficient (2Deocampo N.D. Huang H. Tindall D.J. Minerva Endocrinol. 2003; 28: 145-153PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in mice have confirmed that lack of PTEN promotes the development of PCa, as mice completely lacking PTEN expression in the prostate develop high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) at early ages and progress to adenocarcinoma (3Wang S.

The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt is the best studied target of this PI 3-kinase pathway, with Akt functioning to inactivate a number of growth-suppressing or pro-apoptotic substrates (6Majumder P.K. Sellers W.R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7465-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Prostate-specific expression of a constitutively activated membrane-targeted Akt causes lesions that resemble PIN, but these lesions do not progress to adenocarcinoma, indicating that additional proteins downstream of PTEN loss and PI 3-kinase pathway activation contribute to PCa growth (7Majumder P.K. Yeh J.J. George D.J. Febbo P.G. Kum J. Xue Q. Bikoff R. Ma H. Kantoff P.W. Golub T.R. Loda M. Sellers W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). One such candidate downstream target of PI 3-kinase is Bmx (also termed Etk), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase member of the Tec kinase family (8Smith C.I. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Mohamed A.J. Nore B.F. Vihinen M. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 436-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Tec kinases are unique among tyrosine kinases in having a PH domain, which mediates membrane targeting by binding PIP3. This exposes the kinase domain to membrane-associated Src (or a Src family kinase), which phosphorylates a regulatory tyrosine in the catalytic site (Tyr-566 in Bmx) to activate the kinase (9Qiu Y. Kung H.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Tec kinases also contain SH2 and SH3 domains, and the latter SH3 domain may mediate an intramolecular inhibitory interaction with the PH domain that is also regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation (10Afar D.E.

In contrast, Bmx in endothelial cells is activated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) through an interaction with the type 2 TNF receptor (TNFR2), with subsequent Bmx-mediated stimulation of the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2, KDR) and PI 3-kinase by unclear mechanisms (22Pan S.

Significantly, Bmx-deficient mice have a defect in ischemia-meditated angiogenesis that correlates with decreased TNFR2 and VEGFR2 signaling in endothelium and bone marrow cells, indicating that Bmx functions physiologically through these receptors in endothelial cells (28He Y.

In epithelial cells, Bmx colocalizes with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in response to integrin signaling, and FAK-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine 40 in the Bmx PH domain may prime Bmx for subsequent phosphorylation by Src (29Chen R.

Bmx in PCa cells can be activated by IL-6 or by a constitutively activate p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase, and Bmx activation by IL-6 is PI 3-kinase-dependent (19Qiu Y. Robinson D. Pretlow T.G. Kung H.J.

Neuropeptides can also activate Bmx in PCa cells, and this activation is dependent on both FAK and Src but is independent of PI 3-kinase (21Lee L.F. Guan J. Qiu Y. Kung H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8385-8397Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bmx can protect PCa cells from radiation or drug-induced apoptosis, and this effect may be mediated through an interaction with the serine/threonine kinase Pim1 (38Kim O. Jiang T.

Significantly, Tec kinase SH3 domains can also mediate an interaction with p53, and Bmx can suppress p53 transcriptional activity, indicating that Bmx may prevent apoptosis through p53 (41Jiang T.

Finally, a recent study showed that transgenic overexpression of Bmx in mouse prostate epithelium caused increased proliferation and the development of lesions resembling human PIN, further indicating that Bmx may be a critical target of PI 3-kinase pathway activation in PCa (37Dai B. Kim O. Xie Y. Guo Z. Xu K. Wang B. Kong X. Melamed J. Chen H. Bieberich C.J. Borowsky A.D. Kung H.J. Wei G. Ostrowski M.C. Brodie A. Qiu Y.

In this study we first confirmed that Bmx was activated downstream of the constitutively active PI 3-kinase in PTEN-deficient PCa cells, and that down-regulation of Bmx could markedly suppress PCa cell growth. We then used Bmx immunoprecipitation and Tyr(P) immunoblotting to identify candidate Bmx upstream activators or downstream substrates in PCa cells, which revealed an interaction between Bmx and ErbB3. Significantly, heregulin-β1 treatment increased the Bmx interaction with ErbB3 and enhanced Bmx tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity. Moreover, EGF treatment similarly enhanced Bmx activation and induced an interaction between Bmx and EGFR. Bmx activation by heregulin-β1 was dependent on both Src and PI 3-kinase, whereas Bmx activation by EGF was Src-dependent but PI 3-kinase-independent. These studies show that Bmx is a downstream target of the activated PI 3-kinase pathway in PTEN-deficient PCa cells, and they provide the first direct link between activation of Bmx and receptor tyrosine kinases. Moreover, they indicate that Bmx should be a valuable therapeutic target in PCa and other cancers in which PI 3-kinase and EGF family receptor pathways are activated.

For transfectants, 10 μg of 3xFLAG-Bmx/pcDNA3 DNA, HA-Bmx/pcDNA3, or PTEN-pcDNA DNA were transfected into LNCaP or PC3 cells in 10-cm plates at 50% confluence using Lipofectamine, with empty vector for controls. For stable transfectants, the media were replaced the next day, and cells were selected with G418 (900 μg/ml). Resistant cells were maintained in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418, and the expression of 3xFLAG-Bmx or HA-Bmx was analyzed by immunoblotting. For Bmx knockdowns, siRNAs were transfected into LNCaP cells at 40 nm, and media were replaced 24 h later. Cells were either maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 4 days or in serum-containing medium for 2 days followed by serum starvation for 2 days. Cells were then trypsinized and counted. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were treated with growth factors, inhibitors, or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) as indicated. They were then washed twice with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and lysed with 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4 and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Cell lysates were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min to remove cell debris. For anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitations, supernatants were transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes, and equal amounts of proteins (1–5 mg) from each sample were mixed with 20–50 μl of 4G10-conjugated agarose beads and incubated at 4 °C overnight with continuous agitation. The mixtures were then transferred to MicroSpin columns (GE Healthcare). The beads were washed with 600 μl of RIPA buffer six times followed by washing with 600 μl of TBS twice. Subsequently, the columns were placed into microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 1200 rpm for 30 s to remove remnants of TBS. The bottoms of the columns were plugged, and 10 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol were added to each column followed by placing the capped columns into microcentrifuge tubes. After incubating at 65 °C for 15 min (to elute bound proteins), the columns were unplugged, transferred into new microcentrifuge tubes, and spun at 2000 rpm for 30 s to collect samples. 1 μl of β-mercaptoethanol was added to each sample, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Samples were then resolved by 4–12% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) followed by membrane transfer. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS/T) at room temperature for 2 h and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBS/T, the membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h, washed, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For Bmx immunoprecipitations by M2-conjugated agarose beads, cells were lysed with TBS containing 1%Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of proteins (1–5 mg) from each sample were then mixed with 20–50 μl of M2-conjugated agarose beads and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with continuous agitation. The beads were then transferred to MicroSpin columns, washed, and incubated with 10 μl of 3xFLAG peptide (100 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight with continuous agitation to elute 3xFLAG-Bmx and associated proteins. The columns were spun at 2000 rpm for 30 s to collect samples. 3 μl of 6 × Laemmli sample buffer and 1 μl of β-mercaptoethanol were added to each sample, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Electrophoresis and immunoblotting were then performed as described above. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous Bmx, cells were lysed with TBS containing 1%Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. 5 mg of proteins from each sample were mixed with 5 μg of mouse anti-Bmx antibody (BD Biosciences) and 5 μg of rabbit anti-Bmx antibody (Cell Signaling) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with continuous agitation. Equal amounts of mouse IgG and rabbit IgG were used as negative controls. 20 μl of protein A/G beads (Pierce) were then added to each sample and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with continuous agitation. Elution of the immunocomplexes and electrophoresis and immunoblotting were performed as described above. In Vitro Kinase Assay—3xFLAG-Bmx was immunoprecipitated from LNCaP cells, treated with or without growth factors or LY294002, and eluted with 3xFLAG peptide. Eluted Bmx was then mixed with kinase buffer (final 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 5 mm Na3VO4) and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The kinase assay was performed at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped with 10 mm EDTA and Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were resolved by 4–12% NuPAGE gel, and Bmx autophosphorylation was visualized by autoradiography. Bmx Is Constitutively Activated Downstream of PI 3-Kinase and Src in PTEN-deficient PCa Cells—PTEN-deficient LNCaP PCa cells have high levels of constitutive PI 3-kinase pathway activation even when cultured in serum-free medium, and inhibition of PI 3-kinase with LY492002 or wortmannin markedly suppresses LNCaP cell growth. To determine whether Bmx was constitutively activated by endogenous PI 3-kinase in PTEN-deficient cells, we generated LNCaP cells that were stably transfected with an epitope-tagged (3xFLAG) Bmx, which could be efficiently immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibodies. As noted above, LNCaP cells grown in serum-free medium maintained high levels of PI 3-kinase pathway activation, as assessed by immunoblotting for pAkt (Fig. 1A). Immunoprecipitation of Bmx from these cells grown in serum-free medium followed by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting indicated that Bmx was partially activated, and it could be further activated when the cells were grown in serum-containing medium (10% FBS) (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3). Consistent with previous data, IL-6 treatment rapidly increased Bmx phosphorylation and Stat3 activation (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Significantly, treatment with a PI 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002) abrogated Akt activation and decreased the levels of Bmx tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that PI 3-kinase contributes to Bmx activation under these conditions (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 versus 1). The basal level of Bmx tyrosine phosphorylation was also reduced by an Src inhibitor (Fig. 1A, PP2, lane 5), and the combination of LY294002 and PP2 resulted in nearly complete loss of basal Bmx phosphorylation (lane 6). When cells were grown in serum-containing medium (10% FBS), we also found that Bmx tyrosine phosphorylation could be markedly decreased by treatment with LY294002 and PP2 (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained in other independent stable LNCaP clones expressing FLAG-Bmx or expressing an HA-tagged Bmx (Fig. 1C and data not shown). We also examined another PTEN-deficient PCa cell line, PC3, which was stably transfected with the 3xFLAG-Bmx. In these cells PP2 alone was more effective than LY294002, but the combination completely blocked Bmx phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). We next used anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitation followed by Bmx immunoblotting to assess the activation of endogenous Bmx in LNCaP cells. There was no detectable activation of endogenous Bmx (above the basal level) by IL-6 in serum-starved cells, although the IL-6 still markedly activated Stat3 (Fig. 1E, lane 2). Similarly to the transfected Bmx, tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Bmx was increased by growth in serum-containing medium. Importantly, inhibition of PI 3-kinase or Src with LY294002 or PP2, respectively, markedly decreased the phosphorylation of endogenous Bmx in serum-containing medium. Moreover, the combination of LY294002 and PP2 decreased Bmx phosphorylation to below its basal level in serum-free medium. In contrast to these results in PTEN-deficient LNCaP cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of Bmx could not be detected under the same conditions in a PCa cell line with intact PTEN (CWR2Rv1), although endogenous Bmx could be readily detected in whole cell lysates from these cells (Fig. 1F). Finally, transfection of wild-type PTEN into the 3xFLAG-Bmx expressing LNCaP cells markedly reduced both PI 3-kinase pathway activation, as assessed by pAkt immunoblotting, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Bmx (Fig. 1G). Taken together, these results indicated that Bmx was constitutively active in LNCaP PCa cells grown in serum-free medium, that it was further activated in medium with 10% FBS, and that the major pathway mediating Bmx activation was PI 3-kinase-dependent membrane recruitment followed by Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. Down-regulation of Bmx Suppresses PCa Cell Growth—To address directly whether endogenous Bmx may be playing a critical role in LNCaP cell growth downstream of PI 3-kinase, we next assessed the effects of Bmx siRNA on cell growth in medium with 10% FBS and in serum-free medium. LNCaP cells were transfected with Bmx or control siRNA and then cultured for 4 days in medium with 10% FBS or for 2 days in 10% FBS medium followed by 2 days in serum-free medium. Cell growth was only modestly decreased in serum-free medium, consistent with the constitutive activity of the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway (Fig. 2, A and B). Cell recovery was moderately decreased by the control siRNA but was markedly decreased by the Bmx siRNA under both conditions, indicating that Bmx plays a significant role in regulating cell growth downstream of PI 3-kinase. Immunoblotting confirmed that Bmx expression was down-regulated by the Bmx siRNA (Fig. 2C). Identification of Bmx-associated Tyrosine-phosphorylated Proteins—In addition to membrane recruitment mediated by the Bmx PH domain, the SH2 domain presumably mediates Bmx binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that may be upstream activators or downstream targets of Bmx. To identify candidate proteins interacting with the Bmx SH2 domain, we used anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated beads to immunoprecipitate 3xFLAG epitope-tagged Bmx from stably transfected LNCaP cells. The beads were eluted sequentially with 3xFLAG peptide and then SDS, as a variable amount of the 3xFLAG Bmx remains associated with the beads after peptide elution. The eluted proteins were then immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P). As a further control for proteins binding nonspecifically to the beads, we also carried out the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations on LNCaP cells stably transfected with an empty expression vector. Fig. 3A is a Tyr(P) immunoblot of whole cell lysates from Bmx (B) and vector control (V) stably transfected LNCaP cells, before and after the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. A large number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were observed in both cells, with several bands appearing to be increased in the Bmx-expressing cells. Strikingly, a single major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of ∼180 kDa was detected in the peptide eluted material from the 3xFLAG-Bmx expressing LNCaP cells versus t"
https://openalex.org/W2035432530,"On the basis of the physical and chemical measurements made on the surface of Venus and transmitted back to Earth by the Soviet automatic landers Venera 9 and Venera 10, a geomorphically inactive environment should be expected. An analysis of the television photographs reveals, however, that at least two processes of degradation occur. One operates on a scale of decimeters to meters and is responsible for the fracturing of a layered source rock and the subsequent downslope movement of the fragments. Mass-wasting, perhaps activated by venusian quakes or by unknown geological processes, is likely to be the agent. Another geomorphic degradation process occurs on the scale of a centimeter or less and is responsible for the rounding of edges and the pitting of rock surfaces. The agents of this process are not known, but atmospheric action, perhaps in connection with volcanic episodes, may be the cause. From a geomorphic point of view, the landscape of the Venera 9 landing site can be considered young and that of the Venera 10 landing site, mature."

We previously showed that Xenopus paraxial protocadherin (PAPC) mediates cell sorting and morphogenesis by down-regulating the adhesion activity of a classical cadherin, C-cadherin. Classical cadherins function by forming lateral dimers that are necessary for their adhesive function. However, it is not known whether oligomerization also plays a role in protocadherin function. We show here that PAPC forms oligomers that are stabilized by disulfide bonds formed between conserved Cys residues in the extracellular domain. Disruption of these disulfide bonds by dithiothreitol or mutation of the conserved cysteines results in defects in oligomerization, post-translational modification, trafficking to the cell surface and cell sorting function of PAPC. Furthermore, none of the residues in the cytoplasmic domain of PAPC is required for its cell sorting activity, whereas both the transmembrane domain and the extracellular domain are necessary. Therefore, protein oligomerization and/or protein interactions via the extracellular and transmembrane domains of PAPC are required for its cell sorting function.

Protocadherins are type I transmembrane glycoproteins belonging to the cadherin superfamily, encoded by both clustered (protocadherin α, β, and γ) and non-clustered protocadherin genes (1Angst B.D.

Their extracellular domains consist of six or seven conserved cadherin repeats, and their cytoplasmic domains are different from that of classical cadherins because they lack the catenin-binding motifs (2Suzuki S.T. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2609-2611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protocadherins all share high sequence similarity in their extracellular domains, whereas the cytoplasmic domains differ greatly among different subclasses. Limited studies have suggested that protocadherins may function in embryonic development and in the development of the central nervous system (3Junghans D. Kim I.G. Kemler R.

Cell. 2006; 124: 1255-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), very little is known about the structure of protocadherins. An NMR structure of the first ectodomain (EC1), one of a total of 6 EC domains, of protocadherin α4 was solved recently (19Morishita H. Kim M. Murata Y. Shibata N. Udaka K. Higuchi Y. Akutsu H. Yamaguchi T. Yagi T. Ikegami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33650-33663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The overall topology of this protocadherin ectodomain is very similar to that of classical cadherins, which is a β sandwich composed of 7 β strands. Classical cadherins are known to function as cell-cell adhesion molecules and they form lateral dimers that are necessary for their adhesive function (20Brieher W.M. Kim A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). No study has yet been done to determine whether protocadherins also oligomerize and whether oligomerization also plays a role in protocadherin function. The dimerization and adhesive function of classical cadherins requires the conserved Trp2 residue in their EC1 domains (21Gumbiner B.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 622-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). In a classical cadherin dimer, the Trp2 from each monomer is inserted reciprocally into a hydrophobic pocket of the other molecule. Protocadherins do not contain the Trp2 residue. Instead, nearly all protocadherins contain a highly conserved Tyr residue near the N terminus of the mature protein. Whether this Tyr can mediate dimerization like the Trp2 in classical cadherins is unknown. Furthermore, protocadherins contain numerous conserved cysteines in the EC domains, which could potentially mediate oligomerization by forming intermolecular disulfide bonds. Studies on protocadherin subunit interactions and oligomerization will help us understand the molecular mechanisms governing protocadherin function. Xenopus paraxial protocadherin (PAPC) is specifically expressed in paraxial mesoderm in early frog embryos and involved in the morphogenesis of gastrula and somites (6Kim S.H. Kim A. Bouwmeester T. Agius E. Robertis E.M. Development. 1998; 125: 4681-4690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kim S.H. Kim W.C. De Robertis E.M. Kintner C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of PAPC (PAPC-EC) has six cadherin repeats and shares high sequence homology to all other protocadherins, whereas the cytoplasmic domain of PAPC is much less conserved with only a segment of ∼25 amino acid residues being conserved across species (supplemental Fig. S3). The closest homolog of PAPC in human or mouse is protocadherin 8 (Pcdh8), although the Xenopus ortholog of Pcdh8 is probably a different protocadherin (GenBank™ accession number: AAH74360). PAPC has been shown to mediate cell sorting and morphogenesis in early embryos (6Kim S.H. Kim A. Bouwmeester T. Agius E. Robertis E.M. Development. 1998; 125: 4681-4690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kim S.H. Kim W.C. De Robertis E.M. Kintner C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 821-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of PAPC in a small area of Xenopus embryos leads to sorting out of the PAPC-expressing cells from the non-expressing cells and formation of a sharp boundary between them (6Kim S.H. Kim A. Bouwmeester T. Agius E. Robertis E.M. Development. 1998; 125: 4681-4690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chen X. Kim B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We previously showed that PAPC mediates these functions not by directly acting as a homophilic adhesion molecule but by down-regulating the adhesion activity of a classical cadherin, C-cadherin (8Chen X. Kim B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, recent evidence suggested that another protocadherin, mouse protocadherin α4, does not mediate homophilic adhesion either (19Morishita H. Kim M. Murata Y. Shibata N.

Murata Y. Yagi T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 494-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The roles of oligomerization, disulfide bond formation, conserved Cys and Tyr residues, and different domains in the trafficking and function of PAPC have been analyzed. Given the high conservation of the extracellular domains among different protocadherins, the findings with PAPC likely reflect the properties of other protocadherins as well. PAPC Constructs—Plasmids pCS2+/FL-PAPC(-UTR), pCS2+/M-PAPC, pEE14/PAPC-EC·His have been described (6Kim S.H. Kim A. Bouwmeester T. Agius E. Robertis E.M. Development. 1998; 125: 4681-4690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Chen X. Kim B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PAPC constructs in pCS2+ vectors were used for the transfection of CHO cells and the in vitro preparation of capped mRNAs for expression in Xenopus embryos. The pEE14/PAPC-EC·His was constructed for eukaryotic expression of secreted PAPC-EC·His proteins. The complete deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of PAPC was achieved by digesting pCS2+/FL-PAPC with XcmI and XhoI, blunting and re-ligating the ends. The resulting construct, pCS2+/ECTM, contains only the extracellular and transmembrane domains of PAPC (1–711 amino acids) and a short peptide tag resulting from the vector sequence (RASRTIVSRIT*). To construct the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked PAPC (pCS2+/PAPC-GPI), the extracellular domain of PAPC was fused to the GPI signal sequence of the human decay-accelerating factor by two rounds of PCR and subsequent cloning into the EcoRI-XbaI site of pCS2+. The primers for the PCRs are: SP6 and PAPC-GPI.r (5′-gga tcg atc tgg tgc tgc tct tct gca gat ggt tg-3′) for amplification of PAPC extracellular domain from pCS2+/M-PAPC, and PAPC-GPI.f (5′-gag cag cac cag atc gat cca aat aaa gga agt gga-3′) and GPI3′-XbaI (5′-ctc tag act aag tca gca agc cca t-3′) for amplification of the GPI-anchor signal from decay-accelerating factor in pCB6/Aenv-GPI (a kind gift from Dr. Judy White, University of Virginia). By similar strategy, the fusion of the PAPC extracellular domain with interleukin 2 receptor α (IL2Rα) transmembrane domain (PAPC-IL2R™), the fusion of IL2R extracellular domain with PAPC transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (IL2R-PAPCTMC), and the point mutation of the M-PAPC transmembrane Cys to Ala (M.C703A) were obtained by PCR methods using pCS2+/FL-PAPC (-UTR), pCS2+/IL2Rα, and/or pCS2+/M-PAPC as primary templates. The coding sequences of resulting fusion or mutant proteins were then inserted into the EcoRI-XbaI or HindIII-XbaI (for IL2R-PAPCTMC) site of pCS2+. The primers used for building these constructs are: SP6, PAPC-IL2R™.f (5′-cag cac cag atc gat tac cag gta gca gtg-3′), PAPC-IL2R™.r (5′-cac tgc tac ctg gta atc gat ctg gtg ctg-3′), IL2R-PAPCTMC.f (5′-tcc aga ttt aca aca gag atg tcc att ata ttc att-3′), IL2R-PAPCTMC.r (5′-aat gaa tat aat gga cat ctc tgt tgt aaa tct gga-3′), C703A.f (5′-gct ggt ggt gct gct ttg cta-3′), C703A.r (5′-tag caa agc agc acc acc agc-3′), and T7. Sp6 and T7 were used for the 2nd round PCR in each case. Site-directed point mutagenesis (Y27S, C90S, C96S, C330S, and C389S) was performed using the QuickChange®-XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) on pEE14/PAPC-EC·His, pCS2+/FL-PAPC(-UTR), or pCS2+/M-PAPC. Double, triple, or quadruple point mutations were achieved by restriction/subcloning approaches or repeated site-directed mutagenesis.

Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of CHO cells was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogene) in 24-well plates according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 0.8 μg of DNA was used for each transfection. Anti-PAPC extracellular domain mAbs, 11A6 and 28F12, were used for immunoblotting of PAPC proteins and have been described (8Chen X. Kim B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Anti-IL2R mAb B-B10 (BioSource/Invitrogen Corp) was used for the immunoblot of IL2R-PAPCTMC. Biochemical Analysis of PAPC-EC·His—The preparation and purification of PAPC-EC·His from conditioned media of transfected CHO cells have been described (8Chen X. Kim B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For gel filtration analysis, 100 μl of 0.4 mg/ml purified PAPC-EC·His was either treated with 10 mm DTT for 30 min and with 20 mm iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature or mock-treated. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, the protein sample was applied to a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences BioSicences/GE Corp), and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH7.5. 0.5 ml fractions were collected. For non-reducing SDS-PAGE, 10 μl of each elution fraction was resolved on a 7% gel without DTT treatment. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose filter and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-PAPC mAbs. Typically, the disulfide bond-mediated oligomerization of PAPC-EC·His can be detected by running non-reducing SDS-PAGE and anti-PAPC immunoblotting. When specifically indicated, 1 mm CuCl2 was added for enhanced cross-linking. For chemical cross-linking, purified PAPC-EC·His (50 μg/ml) was dialyzed in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 and then incubated with 1 mm ethylene glycol bis[succinimidylsuccinate] (EGS, from Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min. The cross-linking was quenched by adding glycine, pH7.8 to a final concentration of 0.1 m, and the product was examined by reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Biochemical Analysis of Cellular PAPC—Trypsinization and biotinylation assays for assessing PAPC cell surface expression have been described (8Chen X. Kim B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The analysis of N-linked glycosylation of PAPC was performed with Endo Hf and peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (New England BioLabs, Inc.) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, confluent CHO cells expressing PAPC in a 10-cm dish were lysed in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and denatured by adding 1/10 volume of 10× glycoprotein denaturing buffer (New England BioLabs, Inc.) and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. The denatured lysate was then supplemented with appropriate 10× reaction buffers (G5 buffer for Endo Hf; G7 buffer and 10% Nonidet P-40 for PNGase F) provided by the manufacturer to obtain 1× reaction mix. For each 30-μl reaction mix, 1 μl of Endo Hf (1,000 NEB units), PNGase F (500 NEB units), or H2O (as control) was added, and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for overnight. One-third of each reaction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting against PAPC. Immunofluorescence Staining of Surface and Total PAPC in Transfected CHO Cells—Transiently transfected CHO cells were incubated with anti-PAPC mAb 28F12 (5 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 45 min, washed 4× with PBS, fixed in -20 °C methanol, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and labeled with Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). After extensive wash, the cells were re-stained with 28F12 and Alexa564-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for total PAPC both inside and on the surface of the cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope with a Zeiss Neoplan10x objective lens. Images were acquired with a Hamamamstu C4742-95 digital cameral and the Open-lab 4.0 (Improvision) software. Assays using Xenopus Embryos—The preparation, handling, and staging of Xenopus laevis embryos and the procedure for ectopic expression of PAPC or PAPC mutant proteins in Xenopus embryos have been described (8Chen X. Kim B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). PAPC or PAPC mutant mRNA (1–1.5 ng) was microinjected into the animal hemisphere of 4-cell stage embryos. At stage 9, proteins were extracted from the embryos and subject to anti-PAPC immunoblotting. The cell dispersal assay was done as previously described (8Chen X. Kim B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The mRNA (600 pg) of PAPC or PAPC mutants was co-injected with the mRNA of nuclear-localized GFP (200 pg, as lineage tracer) into one blastomere of 32-cell stage embryos. At stage 13–14, the dispersal of the GFP-positive cells was scored under fluorescence microscope. PAPC Forms Disulfide Bond-dependent Homo-oligomers—To better study the properties of the PAPC extracellular domain, a His6-tagged secreted form of the extracellular domain of PAPC (PAPC-EC·His) was purified from conditioned CHO cell media (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). We first asked whether PAPC-EC·His forms oligomers as classical cadherins form dimers (20Brieher W.M. Kim A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Because the PAPC extracellular domain contains conserved Cys residues, we examined whether PAPC-EC·His forms disulfide bond-linked oligomers. Under reducing conditions, purified PAPC-EC·His migrates at ∼100 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels; whereas under non-reducing conditions, nearly half of the PAPC-EC·His migrates at ∼300 kDa, suggesting that PAPC-EC·His forms disulfide bond-linked homo-oligomers (Fig. 2A). Incubation of PAPC-EC·His with 1 mm of CuCl2, an oxidizer that promotes disulfide bond formation, led to more PAPC-EC·His in the oligomeric form in the non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Moreover, the formation of PAPC-EC·His oligomers can also be detected by chemical cross-linking via EGS, even when subsequently analyzed under reducing conditions (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Compared with the disulfide-cross-linked samples (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3), which still contained a significant portion of monomeric PAPC-EC·His, EGS treated PAPC-EC·His consisted mostly of the higher molecular weight form (Fig. 2A, lane 4). This suggests that some of PAPC-EC·His oligomers are not linked by disulfide bonds.FIGURE 2PAPC forms disulfide bond-dependent oligomers. A, purified PAPC-EC·His forms oligomers that can be covalently linked by disulfide bonds or chemically cross-linked with EGS. Purified PAPC-EC·His was pretreated as indicated, resolved on a non-reducing or reducing (+β-ME) SDS-PAGE gel, and analyzed by anti-PAPC immunoblotting. EGS, ethylene glycol bis[succinimidylsuccinate]. B and C, gel filtration analysis of untreated (B) or DTT/IAA-pretreated (C) PAPC-EC·His. Fractions were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and anti-PAPC immunoblotting. Arrows indicate the elution fractions of corresponding molecular weight standards. D, M-PAPC and FL-PAPC form disulfide bond-linked oligomers in transfected CHO cells. Cell lysates of CHO cells expressing either M-PAPC or FL-PAPC were resolved by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of DTT, and immunoblotted with anti-PAPC mAb. E, M-PAPC expressed in Xenopus embryos forms oligomers. Lysates of mock-injected control embryos (Con) or M-PAPC-RNA-injected embryos (M) were resolved by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of DTT, and blotted with anti-PAPC antibody. F, endogenous PAPC oligomerizes in Xenopus embryos. Lysates of stage 12 embryos were treated with or without DTT and analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and anti-PAPC immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize the PAPC oligomers and examine the role of disulfide bonds in PAPC oligomerization, we performed gel filtration analysis of purified PAPC-EC·His protein that was either untreated or reduced with DTT and treated with iodoacetamide (IAA) to prevent the re-formation of disulfide bonds (Fig. 2, B and C). Fractions were analyzed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting against PAPC. Without DTT treatment, purified PAPC-EC·His elutes largely in two pools: one with a peak in fractions 20–21, which corresponds to a size of ∼300 kDa; the other with a peak in fractions 24–25, which corresponds to a size of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 2B). A large portion of the PAPC in the high molecular weight (M.W.) column fractions migrates at ∼300 kDa in a non-reducing gel, whereas most PAPC in the low M.W. fractions migrates at the monomer size of PAPC-EC·His. These results indicate that a significant portion of PAPC-EC·His forms homo-oligomers in solution. Noticeably, a significant portion of PAPC-EC·His in the high M.W. gel filtration peak still runs at the monomer size in non-reducing SDS-PAGE, suggesting that not all PAPC molecules are covalently linked to each other in the oligomer complex and that oligomerization can occur without intermolecular disulfide linkage (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the cross-linking data shown in Fig. 2A. Although the intermolecular disulfide linkage is not necessary for PAPC-EC·His oligomerization, some intramolecular disulfide bonds must be required, because disruption of all disulfide bonds by DTT and IAA treatment eliminated both the ∼300-kDa band in the non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel and the high M.W. gel filtration peak of PAPC-EC·His (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the disulfide bonds of PAPC are not only responsible for intermolecular linkage, but are probably also required for maintaining or stabilizing correct PAPC conformation necessary for oligomerization. Therefore, PAPC-EC·His forms oligomers that can exist with or without intermolecular disulfide linkages. Based on the size estimated from both the SDS-PAGE and gel filtration profiles, the size of the PAPC oligomer is consistent with being a homotrimer, although other oligomerization states are possible. To test whether oligomerization is an intrinsic property of PAPC within the cell, we examined the oligomerization state of a truncated transmembrane form of PAPC (M-PAPC, see Fig. 1) and the full-length PAPC (FL-PAPC, see Fig. 1) in either PAPC-expressing CHO cells or in Xenopus embryos. In PAPC-expressing CHO cells, most of either M-PAPC or FL-PAPC exist as disulfide bond-linked oligomers as shown by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2D) and the size of the oligomers is slightly larger than that of PAPC-EC·His oligomers. In Xenopus embryos, over half of exogenously expressed M-PAPC exists as disulfide bond linked oligomers (Fig. 2E), with a similar size as observed in CHO cells. Endogenous FL-PAPC also exists in oligomers (Fig. 2F), again, about 3 times the size of the reduced monomeric polypeptide. Therefore, PAPC forms disulfide bond-dependent oligomers in cells and embryos. Conserved Cys Residues Are Necessary for PAPC Oligomerization, Proper Glycosylation, Trafficking to the Cell Surface, and Function—To investigate whether the disulfide-dependent oligomerization of PAPC is necessary for PAPC function, we decided to mutate the cysteines in the extracellular domain of PAPC. There are five Cys residues in the extracellular region of PAPC: Cys90 and Cys96 in the EC1 domain, Cys330 in the EC3 domain, Cys389 in the EC4 domain, and Cys564 in the EC5 domain. The first four Cys residues are highly conserved, not only among PAPC homologs across species but also in other protocadherins. The fifth Cys, Cys564, is not conserved at all, even among PAPC homologs (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). The two Cys residues in the EC1 domain are absolutely conserved in all protocadherins; Cys330 and Cys389 are present in most protocadherins but are somewhat less conserved. In known PAPC homologs, Cys330 is conserved in every species, and Cys389 is conserved in most of them (7/8) (supplemental Fig. S3). We generated single (C90S, C96S, or C330S), double (C90/96S, C90/330S, or C96/330S), triple (3S), and quadruple (4S) Cys → Ser mutations in PAPC-EC·His (Fig. 1). PAPC-EC·His proteins bearing these mutations were expressed in CHO cells for examining oligomerization of the secreted mutant proteins. Surprisingly, all these mutations, except for the C330S single mutation, led to failure of PAPC secretion (compared with the wild-type protein), even though similar amount of mutant proteins were detected in total CHO cell lysates (Fig. 3A). The secreted C330S mutant still makes intermolecular disulfide bonds as shown by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B), suggesting that mutating Cys330 alone is not enough to prevent disulfide bond formation. We therefore examined the soluble Cys mutant PAPC-EC·His proteins from total cell lysates by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, and found that all mutants, including the quadruple Cys mutant, could still form oligomeric species (Fig. 3C). However, the gel band patterns of mutant oligomers were much more variable than the wild-type PAPC oligomers, with multiple additional bands observed on the gel (Fig. 3C). Notably, the unreduced 4S mutant oligomer migrates at 250 kDa, smaller than the ∼300-kDa wild type oligomer (Fig. 3C). Protein degradation is unlikely the cause of the difference in band M.W., because every PAPC mutant protein ran as a single monomeric band in the reducing SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 3A), without any lower M.W. degradation product observed (data not shown). The fact that the mutant oligomers, except for the C330S, cannot be secreted (Fig. 3A) suggests that they are different from the wild type ones. Therefore, we conclude that mutation of the conserved Cys residues in soluble PAPC-EC·His results in abnormal protein oligomerization and failure of protein secretion. Because membrane association could limit the orientation of PAPC molecules and prevent the non-physiological oligomerization observed in soluble PAPC-EC·His Cys mutants, we decided to determine the roles of Cys residues in PAPC oligomerization using the transmembrane forms of PAPC, either FL-PAPC or M-PAPC (Fig. 1). We generated single (FL.C96S), triple (M.3S) and quadruple (M.4S) Cys mutants (Fig. 1), which represent various Cys mutants that exhibited different oligomerization patterns in PAPC-EC·His (Fig. 3C"
