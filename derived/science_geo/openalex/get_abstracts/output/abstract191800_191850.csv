https://openalex.org/W2053762415,"IT is notoriously difficult to produce consistent and uniform results in the vital staining of nerve fibres with methylene blue. Using Weddell's methods1,2, both local and intravenous methylene blue in rabbits have given unsatisfactory results, with patchy and inconsistent staining."

https://openalex.org/W1980833824,"THE cytogenetic method of investigation in malaria mosquitoes, based on morphological comparative study of salivary chromosomes, has been fruitful in the analysis of the maculipennis group. The results obtained are in good agreement with those of taxonomic studies based on egg morphology and larval chetotaxis; moreover, they permit systematic diagnosis also where such morphological differential characters vary too much or are altogether lacking. For example, where mixed A. typicus and messeæ occur in a larval breeding place, no larval character is sufficient for their discrimination, whereas cytological examination shows different structures in the X-chromosome which are absolutely constant and characteristic of each species. The method of examination is both easy and rapid."

https://openalex.org/W2062803118,"WORKING with Nichols's pathogenic strain in the treponemal immobilization test, it is a common experience1 that some sera constantly yield inconclusive results and, further, that from time to time a whole series of results must be discarded, because one or another of the controls shows poor survival of the treponemes."
https://openalex.org/W2018228161,"IN adrenalectomized animals maintained on an adequate diet, the work capacity of skeletal muscle, as shown by the response to prolonged repetitive stimulation, is greatly diminished1. This effect is apparently not due to a direct failure of energy supply as could be expected from hypoglycaemia, but to an alteration in the metabolic or contractile system of the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2080850244,"AEROBIC adaptation to the utilization of galactose in Saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs in two phases: an oxidative phase in which the respiratory quotient is 1, and a fermentative phase which follows it1. Further experiments have now demonstrated that during the oxidative phase of adaptation to galactose, the yeast cells are capable of fermenting galactose if anaerobic conditions are introduced. The degree of fermentation which resulted when anaerobic conditions were instituted was found to be correlated with the degree of adaptation during the oxidative phase as measured by the ."

https://openalex.org/W1980908763,"EGYPTIAN cattle, buffaloes and high-grade shorthorns were used for studying the effect of age, lactation and fattening on heat tolerance coefficients. The method developed by Rhoad1 was used in estimating the heat tolerance, and the test was carried out twice during July 1952. The atmospheric temperature during test days ranged between 91° and 98.6° F., and relative humidity between 42 and 68 per cent. The average body temperatures of animals during March 1950 were taken as normal body temperature2."
https://openalex.org/W1992946553,"A NEW method of providing dyes for some of the commoner staining procedures has been developed and tested. A small volume of the required dye solution is prepared according to the appropriate formula. The fluid is placed in a large dish, and rounds of No. 4 Whatman filter paper are soaked in it. After a few seconds the paper is removed by means of flat forceps and hung over a glass rod to dry. The dye-paper is then cut into suitable ‘chips’—papers 1½ in. long by ¾ in. wide are found to give good results. One round of 11 cm. diameter paper will provide a useful number of dye-papers which can be stapled together in the form of a booklet, with a plain paper cover. The dye-papers do not stain dry fingers and they can be made by unskilled labour in any laboratory."

Although the fat itself may not be readily oxidizable, it may possibly be measured indirectly by means of the substances associated with it in the fat phase and which are probably present in proportion to the amount of fat. Thus it would appear reasonable to believe that an oxidimetric method could be devised for measuring the total solids of milk. Such a test could be carried out much more rapidly and simply than by the methods usually employed."
