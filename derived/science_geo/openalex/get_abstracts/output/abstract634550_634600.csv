https://openalex.org/W2952863642,"The NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by stimuli that include nigericin, uric acid crystals, amyloid-β fibrils and extracellular ATP. The mitotic kinase NEK7 licenses the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in interphase. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of inactive human NLRP3 in complex with NEK7, at a resolution of 3.8 Å. The earring-shaped NLRP3 consists of curved leucine-rich-repeat and globular NACHT domains, and the C-terminal lobe of NEK7 nestles against both NLRP3 domains. Structural recognition between NLRP3 and NEK7 is confirmed by mutagenesis both in vitro and in cells. Modelling of an active NLRP3-NEK7 conformation based on the NLRC4 inflammasome predicts an additional contact between an NLRP3-bound NEK7 and a neighbouring NLRP3. Mutations to this interface abolish the ability of NEK7 or NLRP3 to rescue NLRP3 activation in NEK7-knockout or NLRP3-knockout cells. These data suggest that NEK7 bridges adjacent NLRP3 subunits with bipartite interactions to mediate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome."

https://openalex.org/W2952081370,"The balance between photosynthetic organic carbon production and respiration controls atmospheric composition and climate1,2. The majority of organic carbon is respired back to carbon dioxide in the biosphere, but a small fraction escapes remineralization and is preserved over geological timescales3. By removing reduced carbon from Earth's surface, this sequestration process promotes atmospheric oxygen accumulation2 and carbon dioxide removal1. Two major mechanisms have been proposed to explain organic carbon preservation: selective preservation of biochemically unreactive compounds4,5 and protection resulting from interactions with a mineral matrix6,7. Although both mechanisms can operate across a range of environments and timescales, their global relative importance on 1,000-year to 100,000-year timescales remains uncertain4. Here we present a global dataset of the distributions of organic carbon activation energy and corresponding radiocarbon ages in soils, sediments and dissolved organic carbon. We find that activation energy distributions broaden over time in all mineral-containing samples. This result requires increasing bond-strength diversity, consistent with the formation of organo-mineral bonds8 but inconsistent with selective preservation. Radiocarbon ages further reveal that high-energy, mineral-bound organic carbon persists for millennia relative to low-energy, unbound organic carbon. Our results provide globally coherent evidence for the proposed7 importance of mineral protection in promoting organic carbon preservation. We suggest that similar studies of bond-strength diversity in ancient sediments may reveal how and why organic carbon preservation-and thus atmospheric composition and climate-has varied over geological time."

Here we assess the current understanding of the relationship between climate and conflict, based on the structured judgments of experts from diverse disciplines. These experts agree that climate has affected organized armed conflict within countries. However, other drivers, such as low socioeconomic development and low capabilities of the state, are judged to be substantially more influential, and the mechanisms of climate–conflict linkages remain a key uncertainty. Intensifying climate change is estimated to increase future risks of conflict. Climate has affected organized armed conflict within countries, and intensifying climate change is estimated to increase future risks of conflict, although other drivers are substantially more influential and the mechanisms of climate–conflict linkages remain uncertain."

https://openalex.org/W2908327343,"Spin orbit coupling (SOC) is the key to realizing time-reversal invariant topological phases of matter. Famously, SOC was predicted by Kane and Mele to stabilize a quantum spin Hall insulator; however, the weak intrinsic SOC in monolayer graphene has precluded experimental observation. Here, we exploit a layer-selective proximity effect---achieved via van der Waals contact to a semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide--to engineer Kane-Mele SOC in ultra-clean \textit{bilayer} graphene. Using high-resolution capacitance measurements to probe the bulk electronic compressibility, we find that SOC leads to the formation of a distinct incompressible, gapped phase at charge neutrality. The experimental data agrees quantitatively with a simple theoretical model in which the new phase results from SOC-driven band inversion. In contrast to Kane-Mele SOC in monolayer graphene, the inverted phase is not expected to be a time reversal invariant topological insulator, despite being separated from conventional band insulators by electric field tuned phase transitions where crystal symmetry mandates that the bulk gap must close. Electrical transport measurements, conspicuously, reveal that the inverted phase has a conductivity $\sim e^2/h$, which is suppressed by exceptionally small in-plane magnetic fields. The high conductivity and anomalous magnetoresistance are consistent with theoretical models that predict helical edge states within the inversted phase, that are protected from backscattering by an emergent spin symmetry that remains robust even for large Rashba SOC. Our results pave the way for proximity engineering of strong topological insulators as well as correlated quantum phases in the strong spin-orbit regime in graphene heterostructures."
https://openalex.org/W2951894749,"A widely held-but rarely tested-hypothesis for the origin of animals is that they evolved from a unicellular ancestor, with an apical cilium surrounded by a microvillar collar, that structurally resembled modern sponge choanocytes and choanoflagellates1-4. Here we test this view of animal origins by comparing the transcriptomes, fates and behaviours of the three primary sponge cell types-choanocytes, pluripotent mesenchymal archaeocytes and epithelial pinacocytes-with choanoflagellates and other unicellular holozoans. Unexpectedly, we find that the transcriptome of sponge choanocytes is the least similar to the transcriptomes of choanoflagellates and is significantly enriched in genes unique to either animals or sponges alone. By contrast, pluripotent archaeocytes upregulate genes that control cell proliferation and gene expression, as in other metazoan stem cells and in the proliferating stages of two unicellular holozoans, including a colonial choanoflagellate. Choanocytes in the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica exist in a transient metastable state and readily transdifferentiate into archaeocytes, which can differentiate into a range of other cell types. These sponge cell-type conversions are similar to the temporal cell-state changes that occur in unicellular holozoans5. Together, these analyses argue against homology of sponge choanocytes and choanoflagellates, and the view that the first multicellular animals were simple balls of cells with limited capacity to differentiate. Instead, our results are consistent with the first animal cell being able to transition between multiple states in a manner similar to modern transdifferentiating and stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2949609212,"Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is not sufficient to meet the physiological need of the body. Women of reproductive age and pregnant women are at a high risk of anemia, which in turn may contribute to maternal morbidity and mortality. We aimed to describe the prevalence of anemia and the factors associated with the risk of developing anemia in women of reproductive age in Nepal. Additionally, we examined the association of women’s decision-making autonomy regarding healthcare and experience of intimate partner violence (IPV) with anemia. Data from the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) were used in this study. The data were adjusted for sampling weight, stratification, and cluster sampling design. A battery-operated portable HemoCue was used to measure hemoglobin and detect anemia. Using complex sample logistic regression, the association between dependent and independent variables were examined; crude and adjusted odds ratio were reported. The mean (± SD) hemoglobin concentration was 12.13 g/dL (± 1.48). Overall, about 41% (95% CI 38.6–43.0%) of women aged 15–49 years were anemic. Women in households with wells as the source of drinking water (aOR 1.93; 95% CI 1.58–2.37) were significantly associated with an increased risk of developing anemia. While women who were currently using hormonal contraceptives (aOR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52–0.76) were significantly less likely to be anemic. After adjusting for background characteristics among women who were married at the time of the survey, decision-making autonomy regarding healthcare, and experience of IPV did not have a significant association with anemia. The high prevalence of anemia suggests the need for substantial improvement in the nutritional status of women. The increased disease burden compared with the past survey highlights the needs to reconsider the existing nutritional policy in Nepal."
https://openalex.org/W2951133747,"Antibodies secreted into mucosal barriers serve to protect the host from a variety of pathogens, and are the basis for successful vaccines1. In type I mucosa (such as the intestinal tract), dimeric IgA secreted by local plasma cells is transported through polymeric immunoglobulin receptors2 and mediates robust protection against viruses3,4. However, owing to the paucity of polymeric immunoglobulin receptors and plasma cells, how and whether antibodies are delivered to the type II mucosa represented by the lumen of the lower female reproductive tract remains unclear. Here, using genital herpes infection in mice, we show that primary infection does not establish plasma cells in the lamina propria of the female reproductive tract. Instead, upon secondary challenge with herpes simplex virus 2, circulating memory B cells that enter the female reproductive tract serve as the source of rapid and robust antibody secretion into the lumen of this tract. CD4 tissue-resident memory T cells secrete interferon-γ, which induces expression of chemokines, including CXCL9 and CXCL10. Circulating memory B cells are recruited to the vaginal mucosa in a CXCR3-dependent manner, and secrete virus-specific IgG2b, IgG2c and IgA into the lumen. These results reveal that circulating memory B cells act as a rapidly inducible source of mucosal antibodies in the female reproductive tract. In a mouse model of herpes simplex 2 virus infection, circulating memory B cells—rather than plasma cells—are shown to be the source of antibody secretion in the vaginal lumen following secondary infection."

https://openalex.org/W2953327854,"Ischemic retinopathies (IRs) are leading causes of visual impairment. They are characterized by an initial phase of microvascular degeneration and a second phase of aberrant pre-retinal neovascularization (NV). microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression, and a number play a role in normal and pathological NV. But, post-transcriptional modulation of miRNAs in the eye during the development of IRs has not been systematically evaluated.Using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) we profiled miRNA expression in the retina and choroid during vasodegenerative and NV phases of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR).Approximately 20% of total miRNAs exhibited altered expression (up- or down-regulation); 6% of miRNA were found highly expressed in retina and choroid of rats subjected to OIR. During OIR-induced vessel degeneration phase, miR-199a-3p, -199a-5p, -1b, -126a-3p displayed a robust decreased expression (> 85%) in the retina. While in the choroid, miR-152-3p, -142-3p, -148a-3p, -532-3p were upregulated (>200%) and miR-96-5p, -124-3p, -9a-3p, -190b-5p, -181a-1-3p, -9a-5p, -183-5p were downregulated (>70%) compared to controls. During peak pathological NV, miR-30a-5p, -30e-5p and 190b-5p were markedly reduced (>70%), and miR-30e-3p, miR-335, -30b-5p strongly augmented (by up to 300%) in the retina. Whereas in choroid, miR-let-7f-5p, miR-126a-5p and miR-101a-3p were downregulated by (>81%), and miR-125a-5p, let-7e-5p and let-7g-5p were upregulated by (>570%) during NV. Changes in miRNA observed using NGS were validated using qRT-PCR for the 24 most modulated miRNAs. In silico approach to predict miRNA target genes (using algorithms of miRSystem database) identified potential new target genes with pro-inflammatory, apoptotic and angiogenic properties.The present study is the first comprehensive description of retinal/choroidal miRNAs profiling in OIR (using NGS technology). Our results provide a valuable framework for the characterization and possible therapeutic potential of specific miRNAs involved in ocular IR-triggered inflammation, angiogenesis and degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2949275689,"The high concentration of arsenic (As) in rice grains, in a large proportion of the rice growing areas, is a critical issue. This study explores the feasibility of conventional (QTL-based) marker-assisted selection and genomic selection to improve the ability of rice to prevent As uptake and accumulation in the edible grains. A japonica diversity panel (RP) of 228 accessions phenotyped for As concentration in the flag leaf (FL-As) and in the dehulled grain (CG-As), and genotyped at 22,370 SNP loci, was used to map QTLs by association analysis (GWAS) and to train genomic prediction models. Similar phenotypic and genotypic data from 95 advanced breeding lines (VP) with japonica genetic backgrounds, was used to validate related QTLs mapped in the RP through GWAS and to evaluate the predictive ability of across populations (RP-VP) genomic estimate of breeding value (GEBV) for As exclusion. Several QTLs for FL-As and CG-As with a low-medium individual effect were detected in the RP, of which some colocalized with known QTLs and candidate genes. However, less than 10% of those QTLs could be validated in the VP without loosening colocalization parameters. Conversely, the average predictive ability of across populations GEBV was rather high, 0.43 for FL-As and 0.48 for CG-As, ensuring genetic gains per time unit close to phenotypic selection. The implications of the limited robustness of the GWAS results and the rather high predictive ability of genomic prediction are discussed for breeding rice for significantly low arsenic uptake and accumulation in the edible grains."

In this study, a new distribution referred to as Alpha-Power Pareto distribution is introduced by including an extra parameter. Several properties of the proposed distribution, including moment generating function, mode, quantiles, entropies, mean residual life function, stochastic orders and order statistics are obtained. Parameters of the proposed distribution have been estimated using maximum likelihood estimation technique. Two real datasets have been considered to examine the usefulness of the proposed distribution. It has been observed that the proposed distribution outperforms different variants of Pareto distribution on the basis of model selection criteria."
https://openalex.org/W2952167479,"Obesity is associated with increased incidence and worse prognosis of more than one dozen tumor types; however, the molecular mechanisms for this association remain under debate. We hypothesized that insulin, which is elevated in obesity-driven insulin resistance, would increase tumor glucose oxidation in obesity-associated tumors. To test this hypothesis, we applied and validated a stable isotope method to measure the ratio of pyruvate dehydrogenase flux to citrate synthase flux (VPDH/VCS, i.e. the percent of total mitochondrial oxidation fueled by glucose) in tumor cells. Using this method, we found that three tumor cell lines associated with obesity (colon cancer [MC38], breast cancer [4T1], and prostate cancer [TRAMP-C3] cells) increase VPDH/VCS in response to physiologic concentrations of insulin. In contrast, three tumor cell lines that are not associated with obesity (melanoma [YUMM1.7], B cell lymphoma [BCL1 clone 5B1b], and small cell lung cancer [NCI-H69] cells) exhibited no oxidative response to insulin. The observed increase in glucose oxidation in response to insulin correlated with a dose-dependent increase in cell division in obesity-associated tumor cell lines when grown in insulin, whereas no alteration in cell division was seen in tumor types not associated with obesity. These data reveal that a shift in substrate preference in the setting of physiologic insulin may comprise a metabolic signature of obesity-associated tumors that differs from that of those not associated with obesity."

However, quantitative kinetic data on myovirus particle opening are lacking, although they are promising tools in bacteriophage-based antimicrobial strategies directed against Gram-negative hosts. For the first time, we show time-resolved DNA ejection from a bacteriophage with a contractile tail, the multi-O-antigen–specific Salmonella myovirus Det7. DNA release from Det7 was triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen receptors and notably slower than in noncontractile-tailed siphoviruses. Det7 showed two individual kinetic steps for tail contraction and particle opening. Our in vitro studies showed that highly specialized tailspike proteins (TSPs) are necessary to attach the particle to LPS. A P22-like TSP confers specificity for the Salmonella Typhimurium O-antigen. Moreover, crystal structure analysis at 1.63 Å resolution confirmed that Det7 recognized the Salmonella Anatum O-antigen via an ε15-like TSP, DettilonTSP. DNA ejection triggered by LPS from either host showed similar velocities, so particle opening is thus a process independent of O-antigen composition and the recognizing TSP. In Det7, at permissive temperatures TSPs mediate O-antigen cleavage and couple cell surface binding with DNA ejection, but no irreversible adsorption occurred at low temperatures. This finding was in contrast to short-tailed Salmonella podoviruses, illustrating that tailed phages use common particle-opening mechanisms but have specialized into different infection niches.

Following contraction, T4 phages do not yet release their DNA but need an additional signal from the membrane to start genome transfer (25Goldberg E. Grinius L. Letellier L.

However, the nature of this putative less specific membrane trigger has so far not been described. EM analyses of T4 bound to E. coli cells captured later steps where the tail tube is inserted into the membrane, building a protein channel for translocation of the genome into the cytoplasm (7Hu B.

The DNA ejection time courses obtained in these experiments suggest that particle-opening kinetics in vitro depend on tail morphology. DNA ejection kinetics of long-tailed Siphoviridae λ, SPP1, and T5 occurred within seconds, faster than genome translocation in vivo, and are driven by the osmotic pressure inside the capsid (29Grayson P.

Given the structural conservation of bacteriophage tail components, this points to conserved conformational rearrangement steps within a given tail architecture. In this work, we describe interactions of Salmonella myovirus Det7 with its purified LPS receptors in vitro. Det7 is a contractile-tailed Viunalikevirus with a 157-kbp dsDNA genome forming small clear plaques on Salmonella Typhimurium (31Walter M. Fiedler C. Grassl R. Biebl M. Rachel R. Hermo-Parrado X.L.

We have analyzed genome release from Det7 upon receptor contact in vitro. For the first time in a bacteriophage with a contractile tail machine, we show the kinetics of this process that has so far neither been quantified for T4 nor for any other myovirus. In contrast to the typical, single-step DNA ejection mechanism found in noncontractile-tailed phages, we describe an additional kinetic step for genome release in the myovirus Det7, associated with its contractile tail machine. In O-antigen–specific phages, TSPs enzymatically modify the LPS O-antigen part as an essential step to start genome release (33Steinbacher S. Baxa U. Miller S. Weintraub A. Seckler R. Huber R.

However, the function of the other three TSPs (gp206, -208, and -209) encoded by Det7 has not been described. The first 150 residues of gp207 were proposed to serve as adaptor domains, binding the TSP to the phage tail apparatus (31Walter M. Fiedler C. Grassl R. Biebl M. Rachel R. Hermo-Parrado X.L.

All four TSPs in Det7 share these 150 homologous residues at their N termini (Fig. S1). In gp206 and gp208, these parts are preceded by two additional N-terminal, nonhomologous extensions of 250 and 80 amino acids, respectively. Det7's TSPs hence have three different putative N-terminal tail adaptor domains. The larger C-terminal TSP parts following the N-terminal tail adaptor domains are responsible for host recognition (33Steinbacher S. Baxa U. Miller S. Weintraub A. Seckler R. Huber R.

We found that gp208 is homologous to the TSP of podovirus ε15, infecting Salmonella Anatum (serogroup E1) (ε15TSP, 33% identity over 798 residues; Fig. S1) and thus designated it as “DettilonTSP” (38Kropinski A.M.

We therefore tested Det7's host specificity and found that it formed plaques on S. Anatum (Table 1). Additionally, it could infect S. Typhimurium or Salmonella Enteritidis. This is in contrast to ε15, P22, and 9NA, which only contain a single TSP type and accordingly showed a more restricted host range (Table 1) (27Andres D. Roske Y. Doering C. Heinemann U. Seckler R.

Open table in a new tab To further analyze how Det7 broadens its host range by employing different TSPs, we cloned and purified a C-terminal fragment of DettilonTSP (DettilonTSPΔN, residues 252–798). DettilonTSP was enzymatically active on purified S. Anatum LPS preparations, where it reduced the number of long O-antigen chains on LPS while shorter chains accumulated (Fig. 2A). DettilonTSP enzymatically produced oligosaccharides from S. Anatum O-polysaccharide. Oligosaccharides contained different numbers of O-antigen repeat units and were separated by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2B). We obtained partially O-acetylated tri-, hexa-, and nonasaccharides, as shown by MALDI MS (Table S1). Their masses corresponded to the reported S.

https://openalex.org/W2949836315,"Paralogues pairs are more frequently observed in eels (Anguilla sp.) than in other teleosts. The paralogues often show low phylogenetic distances; however, they have been assigned to the third round of whole genome duplication (WGD), shared by all teleosts (3R), due to their conserved synteny. The apparent contradiction of low phylogenetic difference and 3R conserved synteny led us to study the duplicated gene complement of the freshwater eels. With this aim, we assembled de novo transcriptomes of two highly relevant freshwater eel species: The European (Anguilla anguilla) and the Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica). The duplicated gene complement was analysed in these transcriptomes, and in the genomes and transcriptomes of other Actinopterygii species. The study included an assessment of neutral genetic divergence (4dTv), synteny, and the phylogenetic origins and relationships of the duplicated gene complements. The analyses indicated a high accumulation of duplications (1217 paralogue pairs) among freshwater eel genes, which may have originated in a WGD event after the Elopomorpha lineage diverged from the remaining teleosts, and thus not at the 3R. However, very similar results were observed in the basal Osteoglossomorpha and Clupeocephala branches, indicating that the specific genomic regions of these paralogues may still have been under tetrasomic inheritance at the split of the teleost lineages. Therefore, two potential hypotheses may explain the results: i) The freshwater eel lineage experienced an additional WGD to 3R, and ii) Some duplicated genomic regions experienced lineage specific rediploidization after 3R in the ancestor to freshwater eels. The supporting/opposing evidence for both hypotheses is discussed."

A high Ni(II) adsorption capacity of 35.50 mg·g-1 in 100 ppm Ni(II) solution with 10 mg modified sewage sludge biochar (MSBC) was achieved. The adsorption kinetic and isotherm were fitted well by the pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir model, respectively. The optimal pH was found around a neutral pH of 7. The adsorption mechanisms of Ni(II) onto MSBC were described as the synergistic effects of electrostatic attraction, ion exchange, inner-sphere complexation and co-precipitation. The initial rapid adsorption phenomenon could be attributed to electrostatic attraction and ion exchange, and then inner-sphere complexation and co-precipitation acted as a crucial role in the following step. The remarkable performance of MSBC provides an effective waste utilization approach to simultaneous sewage sludge recycle and Ni removal from aqueous solution."
https://openalex.org/W2951961782,"The evaluation of large amounts of digital image data is of growing importance for biology, including for the exploration and monitoring of marine habitats. However, only a tiny percentage of the image data collected is evaluated by marine biologists who manually interpret and annotate the image contents, which can be slow and laborious. In order to overcome the bottleneck in image annotation, two strategies are increasingly proposed: “citizen science” and “machine learning”. In this study, we investigated how the combination of citizen science, to detect objects, and machine learning, to classify megafauna, could be used to automate annotation of underwater images. For this purpose, multiple large data sets of citizen science annotations with different degrees of common errors and inaccuracies observed in citizen science data were simulated by modifying “gold standard” annotations done by an experienced marine biologist. The parameters of the simulation were determined on the basis of two citizen science experiments. It allowed us to analyze the relationship between the outcome of a citizen science study and the quality of the classifications of a deep learning megafauna classifier. The results show great potential for combining citizen science with machine learning, provided that the participants are informed precisely about the annotation protocol. Inaccuracies in the position of the annotation had the most substantial influence on the classification accuracy, whereas the size of the marking and false positive detections had a smaller influence."
https://openalex.org/W2950776233,"Wildlife diseases have posed a significant challenge to the conservation of many species in recent years. Diseases have been implicated in population declines over large geographic areas, with severe disease outbreaks leading to either local or complete extinctions of wild populations. Ophidiomycosis, commonly known as snake fungal disease, is caused by the fungus Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, which has been documented in snake populations across the eastern and southern United States. We collected swab samples from the federally threatened Eastern Indigo Snake (Drymarchon couperi) in populations across the species’ Georgia range. We used quantitative PCR to determine the presence of O. ophiodiicola DNA and also recorded skin abnormalities characteristic of ophidiomycosis. From 1 September 2016 to 4 August 2018, Eastern Indigo Snakes tested positive for O. ophiodiicola DNA on 47 of 107 occasions (43.9%) and tested negative for fungal DNA but had skin lesions consistent with ophidiomycosis on 42 occasions (39.3%). Symptomatic and qPCR positive individuals were more likely to be encountered during January and February when compared to November and December. We found no effect of sex (p = 0.517), age-class (p = 0.106), or body size (snout-vent length: p = 0.083; mass: p = 0.206; body condition: p = 0.063) on ophidiomycosis status. Over the two-year study, we encountered individuals in which infection was clearly negatively impacting overall health and also documented individuals in which infection apparently cleared from one year to the next. These results demonstrate that O. ophiodiicola and lesions characteristic of ophidiomycosis are widespread in Georgia’s Eastern Indigo Snake populations. However, there are many unanswered questions regarding this disease, including the effects of disease on populations and individuals, the presence of infection vectors, and the change in prevalence over time. More research is needed to address ophidiomycosis and understand its impacts on ongoing conservation efforts."

Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (Phlpp1) regulates protein kinase C (PKC) and other proteins in the control of bone mass. Germline Phlpp1 deficiency reduces bone volume, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we found that conditional Phlpp1 deletion in murine osteoclasts increases their numbers, but also enhances bone mass. Despite elevating osteoclasts, Phlpp1 deficiency did not increase serum markers of bone resorption, but elevated serum markers of bone formation. These results suggest that Phlpp1 suppresses osteoclast formation and production of paracrine factors controlling osteoblast activity. Phlpp1 deficiency elevated osteoclast numbers and size in ex vivo osteoclastogenesis assays, accompanied by enhanced expression of proto-oncogene C-Fms (C-Fms) and hyper-responsiveness to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) in bone marrow macrophages. Although Phlpp1 deficiency increased TRAP+ cell numbers, it suppressed actin-ring formation and bone resorption in these assays. We observed that Phlpp1 deficiency increases activity of PKCζ, a PKC isoform controlling cell polarity, and that addition of a PKCζ pseudosubstrate restores osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption of Phlpp1-deficient osteoclasts. Moreover, Phlpp1 deficiency increased expression of the bone-coupling factor collagen triple helix repeat-containing 1 (Cthrc1). Conditioned growth medium derived from Phlpp1-deficient osteoclasts enhanced mineralization of ex vivo osteoblast cultures, an effect that was abrogated by Cthrc1 knockdown. In summary, Phlpp1 critically regulates osteoclast numbers, and Phlpp1 deficiency enhances bone mass despite higher osteoclast numbers because it apparently disrupts PKCζ activity, cell polarity, and bone resorption and increases secretion of bone-forming Cthrc1. Enhanced osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and diminished formation may promote bone loss. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1 (Phlpp1) regulates protein kinase C (PKC) and other proteins in the control of bone mass. Germline Phlpp1 deficiency reduces bone volume, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we found that conditional Phlpp1 deletion in murine osteoclasts increases their numbers, but also enhances bone mass. Despite elevating osteoclasts, Phlpp1 deficiency did not increase serum markers of bone resorption, but elevated serum markers of bone formation. These results suggest that Phlpp1 suppresses osteoclast formation and production of paracrine factors controlling osteoblast activity.

Previous studies have utilised semi-defined media recipes that contain complex, undefined, biologically derived nutrients which have unknown ingredients that cannot be quantified during metabolic profiling. This study used design of experiments to investigate how individual nutrients and interactions between these nutrients contribute to growth. A mathematically derived defined medium has been formulated that has been shown to robustly support growth of G. thermoglucosidans in two different environmental conditions (96-well plate and shake flask) and with a variety of lignocellulose-based carbohydrates. This enabled the catabolism of industrially relevant carbohydrates to be investigated."

Research has not yet well documented the precise location of healthy and unhealthy food resources around children’s homes and schools. The objective of this study was to examine the food environment around homes and schools for all public school children, stratified by race/ethnicity and poverty status. This cross-sectional study linked data on the exact home and school addresses of a population-based sample of public school children in New York City from 2013 to all corner stores, supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, and wait-service restaurants. Two measures were created around these addresses for all children: 1) distance to the nearest outlet, and 2) count of outlets within 0.25 miles. The total analytic sample included 789,520 K-12 graders. The average age was 11.78 years (SD ± 4.0 years). Black, Hispanic, and Asian students live and attend schools closer to nearly all food outlet types than White students, regardless of poverty status. Among not low-income students, Black, Hispanic, and Asian students were closer from home and school to corner stores and supermarkets, and had more supermarkets around school than White students. The context in which children live matters, and more nuanced data is important for development of appropriate solutions for childhood obesity. Future research should examine disparities in the food environment in other geographies and by other demographic characteristics, and then link these differences to health outcomes like body mass index. These findings can be used to better understand disparities in food access and to help design policies intended to promote healthy eating among children."
https://openalex.org/W2952211560,"Current predictive models of collective action have devoted little attention to personal values, such as morals or ideology. The present research addresses this issue by incorporating a new axiological path in a novel predictive model of collective action, named AICAM. The axiological path is formed by two constructs: ideology and moral obligation. The model has been tested for real normative participation (Study 1) and intentional non-normative participation (Study 2). The sample for Study 1 included 531 randomly selected demonstrators and non-demonstrators at the time of a protest that took place in Madrid, May 2017. Study 2 comprised 607 randomly selected participants who filled out an online questionnaire. Structural equation modelling analysis was performed in order to examine the fit and predictive power of the model. Results show that the model is a good fit in both studies. It has also been observed that the new model entails a significant addition of overall effect size when compared with alternative models, including SIMCA. The present research contributes to the literature of collective action by unearthing a new, independent path towards collective action that is nonetheless compatible with previous motives. Implications for future research are discussed, mainly stressing the need to include moral and ideological motives in the study of collective action engagement."

There is a paucity of data on exercise capacity using cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) in non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis. Our aim was to compare exercise capacity using CPET in CF and non-CF bronchiectasis patients.Cross-sectional retrospective/prospective controlled study assessing CPET using cycle ergometer. Exercise parameters and computed tomography (CT) findings were compared. Results: Hundred two patients with bronchiectasis and 88 controls were evaluated; 49 CF (age 19.7 ± 9.7 y/o, FEV1%predicted 70.9 ± 20.5%) and 53 non-CF (18.6 ± 10.6 y/o, FEV1%predicted 68.7 ± 21.5%). Peak oxygen uptake (peak [Formula: see text]) was similar and relatively preserved in both groups (CF 1915.5±702.0; non-CF 1740±568; control 2111.0±748.3 mL/min). Breathing limitation was found in the two groups vs. control; low breathing reserve (49% in CF; 43% non-CF; 5% control) and increased [Formula: see text] (CF 31.4±4.1, non-CF 31.7±4.1 and control 27.2 ± 2.8). Oxygen pulse was lower in the non-CF; whereas a linear relationship between peak [Formula: see text] vs. FEV1 and vs. FVC was found only for CF. CT score correlated with [Formula: see text] and negatively correlated with [Formula: see text] and post exercise oxygen saturation (SpO2).CPET parameters may differ between CF and non-CF bronchiectasis. However, normal exercise capacity may be found unrelated to the etiology of the bronchiectasis. Anatomical changes in CT are associated with functional finding of increased [Formula: see text] and decreased SpO2. Larger longitudinal studies including cardiac assessment are needed to better study exercise capacity in different etiologies of non-CF bronchiectasis.ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number: NCT03147651."
https://openalex.org/W2949152337,"Ficus species are keystone plants in tropical rainforests, and hemi-epiphytic figs play a notably important role in forest ecosystems. Because hemi-epiphytic figs have strict germination requirements, germination and establishment stages regulate their populations. Despite the ecological importance of hemi-epiphytic figs in the rainforests, seed dispersal systems by fig-eating animals under natural conditions remain unknown because of the difficulty in tracing the destiny of dispersed seeds in the canopy. Therefore, seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) has never been evaluated for hemi-epiphytic figs. We evaluated the SDE of hemi-epiphytic figs using qualitative and quantitative components by three relatively large-sized (> 3 kg) arboreal and volant animals in Bornean rainforests that largely depend on fig fruits in their diets: binturongs Arctictis binturong, Mueller’s gibbons Hylobates muelleri, and helmeted hornbills Rhinoplax vigil. The SDE values of binturongs was by far the highest among the three study animals. Meanwhile, successful seed dispersal of hemi-epiphytic figs by gibbons and helmeted hornbills is aleatory and rare. Given that seed deposition determines the fate of hemi-epiphytic figs, the defecatory habits of binturongs, depositing feces on specific microsites in the canopy, is the most reliable dispersal method, compared to scattering feces from the air or upper canopy. We showed that reliable directed dispersal of hemi-epiphytic figs occurs in high and uneven canopy of Bornean rainforests. This type of dispersal is limited to specific animal species, and therefore it may become one of the main factors regulating low-success hemi-epiphytic fig recruitment in Bornean rainforests."
https://openalex.org/W2953165859,"Although the administration of retinoids represents an important part of treatment for children suffering from high-risk neuroblastomas, approximately 50% of these patients do not respond to this therapy or develop resistance to retinoids during treatment. Our study focused on the comparative analysis of the expression of five genes and corresponding proteins (DDX39A, HMGA1, HMGA2, HOXC9 and PBX1) that have recently been discussed as possible predictive biomarkers of clinical response to retinoid differentiation therapy. Expression of these five candidate biomarkers was evaluated at both the mRNA and protein level in the same subset of 8 neuroblastoma cell lines after treatment with natural or synthetic retinoids. We found that the cell lines that were HMGA2-positive and/or HOXC9-negative have a reduced sensitivity to retinoids. Furthermore, the experiments revealed that the retinoid-sensitive cell lines showed a uniform pattern of change after treatment with both natural and sensitive retinoids: increased DDX39A and decreased PBX1 protein levels. Our results showed that in NBL cells, these putative protein biomarkers are associated with sensitivity or resistance to retinoids, and their endogenous or induced expression can distinguish between these two phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2949153128,"Endothelialization of small diameter synthetic vascular grafts is a potential solution to the thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia that plague current devices. Endothelial colony forming cells, which are blood-derived and similar to mature endothelial cells, are a potential cell source. Anisotropic spatial growth restriction micropatterning has been previously shown to affect the morphology and function of mature endothelial cells in a manner similar to unidirectional fluid shear stress. To date, endothelial colony forming cells have not been successfully micropatterned. This study addresses the hypothesis that micropatterning of endothelial colony forming cells will induce morphological elongation, cytoskeletal alignment, and changes in immunogenic and thrombogenic-related gene expression.Spatially growth restrictive test surfaces with 25 μm-wide lanes alternating between collagen-I and a blocking polymer were created using microfluidics. Case-matched endothelial colony forming cells and control mature carotid endothelial cells were statically cultured on either micropatterned or non-patterned surfaces. Cell elongation was quantified using shape index. Using confocal microscopy, cytoskeletal alignment was visualized and density and apoptotic rate were determined. Gene expression was measured using quantitative PCR to measure KLF-2, eNOS, VCAM-1, and vWF.Endothelial colony forming cells were successfully micropatterned for up to 50 hours. Micropatterned cells displayed elongation and actin alignment. Micropatterning increased the packing densities of both cell types, but did not affect apoptotic rate, which was lower in endothelial colony forming cells. KLF-2 gene expression was increased in micropatterned relative to non-patterned endothelial colony forming cells after 50 hours. No significant differences were seen in the other genes tested.Endothelial colony forming cells can be durably micropatterned using spatial growth restriction. Micropatterning has a significant effect on the gross and subcellular morphologies of both cell types. Further study is required to fully understand the effect of micropatterning on endothelial colony forming cell gene expression."

Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the Cervical Dysplasia Distress Questionnaire (CDDQ) among women in Serbia. Methods In 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional study involving 154 consecutive women attending cervical cancer screening who had received abnormal Pap smear results. Results Reliability assessment showed good internal consistency for all CDDQ subscales (Tension and discomfort: Cronbach’s α = 0.844; Embarrassment: α = 0.864; Sexual and reproductive consequences: α = 0.867; and Health consequences: α = 0.913). The test-retest reliability showed that the correlation coefficients (between 0.805 and 0.983) were significant at the 0.01 level for all of the Serbian CDDQ subscales. Principal Axis Factoring with Direct Oblimin rotation indicated four main components that explain 55.0% of variance. Conclusion The Serbian version of the CDDQ scale is a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of psychological distress among women with abnormal Pap smear results."

https://openalex.org/W2949277709,"α-Amino-β-carboxymuconate-ϵ-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) plays an important role in l-tryptophan degradation via the kynurenine pathway. ACMSD forms a homodimer and is functionally inactive as a monomer because its catalytic assembly requires an arginine residue from a neighboring subunit. However, how the oligomeric state and self-association of ACMSD are controlled in solution remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that ACMSD from Pseudomonas fluorescens can self-assemble into homodimer, tetramer, and higher-order structures. Using size-exclusion chromatography coupled with small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS) analysis, we investigated the ACMSD tetramer structure, and fitting the SAXS data with X-ray crystal structures of the monomeric component, we could generate a pseudo-atomic structure of the tetramer. This analysis revealed a tetramer model of ACMSD as a head-on dimer of dimers. We observed that the tetramer is catalytically more active than the dimer and is in equilibrium with the monomer and dimer. Substituting a critical residue of the dimer-dimer interface, His-110, altered the tetramer dissociation profile by increasing the higher-order oligomer portion in solution without changing the X-ray crystal structure. ACMSD self-association was affected by pH, ionic strength, and other electrostatic interactions. Alignment of ACMSD sequences revealed that His-110 is highly conserved in a few bacteria that utilize nitrobenzoic acid as a sole source of carbon and energy, suggesting a dedicated functional role of ACMSD's self-assembly into the tetrameric and higher-order structures. These results indicate that the dynamic oligomerization status potentially regulates ACMSD activity and that SEC-SAXS coupled with X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for studying protein self-association."

Group prenatal care (GPC) is an integrated approach incorporating peer support and health education that provides prenatal care in a group setting. The GPC approach was piloted in a district of Bangladesh to measure the feasibility and effectiveness of GPC compared to individual care. Understanding the experiences of women of receiving this grouped care approach is crucial to understand the perspectives, perception, and acceptability of the programme among mothers, which are lack in Bangladesh. The objective of the present study was to understand the core experiences and perspectives of mothers who participated in GPC sessions during their pregnancy period.A qualitative research approach was used to understand the experiences of women receiving GPC. A total of 21 in-depth interviews were conducted in this study targeting pregnant mothers who attended all recommended GPC sessions. Face-to-face interviews were conducted by trained and experienced interviewers using a specific interview guideline to achieve detailed responses. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyse the data.Mothers appreciated receiving pregnancy care in group setting and expressed their preferences towards GPC compared to individual care. Themes included the comprehensiveness of GPC, prescheduled appointments and reduced waiting time, social gathering, coping with common discomforts, relationship with service providers, birth preparedness, and recommendations from participating mothers. The themes conveyed overall positive experiences of the participating mothers, with suggestions for further betterment of the programme. Nevertheless, the reported experiences of women involved in the study suggests that the inclusion of a specialist in group care, post-partum care, and family planning advice will be more beneficial in the GPC model.The overall experiences of the women in the present study suggest that GPC is helpful for them, and it is useful to reduce complications during pregnancy.

https://openalex.org/W2950601764,"A better understanding of the structural basis for the preferences of RNA and DNA polymerases for nucleoside-5′-triphosphates (NTPs) could help define the catalytic mechanisms for nucleotidyl transfer during RNA and DNA synthesis and the origin of primordial nucleic acid biosynthesis. We show here that ribonucleoside-5′-diphosphates (NDPs) can be utilized as substrates by RNA polymerase (RNAP). We found that NDP incorporation is template-specific and that noncognate NDPs are not incorporated. Compared with the natural RNAP substrates, NTPs, the Km of RNAP for NDPs was increased ∼4-fold, whereas the Vmax was decreased ∼200-fold. These properties could be accounted for by molecular modeling of NTP/RNAP co-crystal structures. This finding suggested that the terminal phosphate residue in NTP (not present in NDP) is important for positioning the nucleotide for nucleolytic attack in the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. Strikingly, a mutational substitution of the active-center βR1106 side chain involved in NTP positioning also strongly inhibited NDP-directed synthesis, even though this residue does not contact NDP. Substitutions in the structurally analogous side chain in RB69 DNA polymerase (Arg-482) and HIV reverse transcriptase (Lys-65) were previously observed to inhibit dNDP incorporation. The unexpected involvement of these residues suggests that they affect a step in catalysis common for nucleic acid polymerases. The substrate activity of NDPs with RNAP along with those reported for DNA polymerases reinforces the hypothesis that NDPs may have been used for nucleic acid biosynthesis by primordial enzymes, whose evolution then led to the use of the more complex triphosphate derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2952014669,"Objective Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) based on cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) is highly accurate in the detection of common fetal autosomal trisomies. Aim of this project was to investigate short-term costs and clinical outcomes of the contingent use of cffDNA for prenatal screening of trisomies 21, 18, 13 within a national health service (NHS). Methods An economic analysis was developed from the perspective of the Italian NHS to compare two possible scenarios for managing pregnant women: women managed according to the Standard of Care screening (SoC) vs a cffDNA scenario, where Harmony Prenatal Test was introduced as a second line screening choice for women with an “at risk” result from SoC screening. Results The introduction of cffDNA as a second line screening test, conditional to a risk ≥ 1:1,000 from SoC screening, showed a 3% increase in the detection of trisomies, with a 71% decrease in the number of invasive tests performed. Total short-term costs (pregnancy management until childbirth) decreased by € 19 million (from € 84.5 to 65.5 million). Conclusion The adoption of the Harmony Prenatal Test in women resulting at risk from SoC screening, implied a greater number of trisomies detection, together with a reduction of the healthcare costs."
https://openalex.org/W2950097347,"There are controversies whether Minimal Change Disease (MCD) and Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) are distinct glomerular lesions or different manifestations within the same spectrum of diseases. The uPAR (urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor) and some slit diaphragm proteins may be altered in FSGS glomeruli and may function as biomarkers of the disease in renal biopsies. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the diagnostic potential of uPAR and glomerular proteins for differentiation between MCD and FSGS in renal pediatric biopsy. Renal biopsies from 50 children between 2 and 18 years old were selected, with diagnosis of MCD (n = 29) and FSGS (n = 21). Control group consisted of pediatric autopsies (n = 15) from patients younger than 18 years old, with no evidences of renal dysfunction. In situ expressions of WT1, nephrin, podocin and uPAR were evaluated by immunoperoxidase technique. Renal biopsy of patients with MCD and FSGS expressed fewer WT1 (p≤0.0001, F = 19.35) and nephrin (p<0.0001; H = 21.54) than patients in the control group. FSGS patients expressed fewer podocin than control (p<0.0359, H = 6.655). FSGS cases expressed more uPAR than each of control and MCD (p = 0.0019; H = 12.57) and there was a positive and significant correlation between nephrin and podocin (p = 0.0026, rS = 0.6502) in these cases. Podocin had sensitivity of 73.3% and specificity of 86.7% (p = 0.0068) and uPAR had sensitivity of 78.9% and specificity of 73.3% (p = 0.0040) for diagnosis of FSGS patients. The main limitation of the study is the limited number of cases due to the difficulty in performing biopsy in pediatric patients. Podocin and uPAR are good markers for FSGS and differentiate these cases from MCD, reinforcing the theory of distinct glomerular diseases. These findings suggest that podocin and uPAR can be used as biomarkers in the routine analysis of renal biopsies in cases of podocytopathies when the lesion (sclerosis) is not sampled."
https://openalex.org/W2950193301,"The transcription factor 12 (tcf12) is a basic Helix-Loop-Helix protein (bHLH) of the E-protein family, proven to play an important role in developmental processes like neurogenesis, mesoderm formation, and cranial vault development. In humans, mutations in TCF12 lead to craniosynostosis, a congenital birth disorder characterized by the premature fusion of one or several of the cranial sutures. Current research has been primarily focused on functional studies of TCF12, hence the cellular expression profile of this gene during embryonic development and early stages of ossification remains poorly understood. Here we present the establishment and detailed analysis of two transgenic tcf12:EGFP fluorescent zebrafish (Danio rerio) reporter lines. Using these transgenic lines, we analyzed the general spatiotemporal expression pattern of tcf12 during different developmental stages and put emphasis on skeletal development and cranial suture patterning. We identified robust tcf12 promoter-driven EGFP expression in the central nervous system (CNS), the heart, the pronephros, and the somites of zebrafish embryos. Additionally, expression was observed inside the muscles and bones of the viscerocranium in juvenile and adult fish. During cranial vault development, the transgenic fish show a high amount of tcf12 expressing cells at the growth fronts of the ossifying frontal and parietal bones and inside the emerging cranial sutures. Subsequently, we tested the transcriptional activity of three evolutionary conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) located in the tcf12 locus by transient transgenic assays and compared their in vivo activity to the expression pattern determined in the transgenic tcf12:EGFP lines. We could validate two of them as tcf12 enhancer elements driving specific gene expression in the CNS during embryogenesis. Our newly established transgenic lines enhance the understanding of tcf12 gene regulation and open up the possibilities for further functional investigation of these novel tcf12 enhancer elements in zebrafish."

Method A purposive sampling strategy was used to include delivery staff at two major hospitals in Kathmandu, Nepal for focus group discussions. Key informant interviews were conducted with the ward in-charges and skilled birth attendant trainers at the respective hospitals. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Result Eight focus group discussions altogether with 34 delivery care staff working in the labor room and birthing units, and 12 key informant interviews with skilled birth attendant trainers/supervisors and ward in-charges from both hospitals participated in the study. Participants had positive attitudes towards delayed cord clamping as it was not perceived to be a difficult task and as they perceived it to be beneficial for mother and child. The “will to do good”, and a high level of trust both in the hierarchical system as well as in scientific evidence were identified as promoters of change. Several barriers were mentioned, such as maternal or fetal medical conditions and physical settings, as constraints to perform delayed cord clamping. They also mentioned difficulties in adopting new guidelines due to habitual practice, lack of formal training and poor coherence within the work team. In order to bring change to the practice, participants highlighted that officially approved national and institutional protocols and regular training are crucial. Conclusion Due to poor coherence within the health system and lack of national or institutional protocols, delivery staff has to rely on their own initiative to develop skills and are left to informal decision making, and are therefore hesitant to apply new routines. In order to change cord clamping practices to align with evidence and policies health-care staff needs to be better supported by the governance structures of the health system, with clear and approved guidelines made available and coherent training and support."

The aims of the study were to determine the prognostic significance of tumor sidedness in colorectal cancer patients undergoing primary tumor resection and to assess associated tumor biology. Methods A total of 3281 consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection of their primary CRC from January 1998 to December 2012 were analyzed for association with tumor biologic factors and with overall survival. Metastatic patients were excluded from analysis. Results Left sided CRCs were associated with a number of additional key prognostic markers including BRAFV600E wildtype status (P<0.001), mismatch repair proficiency (p<0.001), absence of peritumoral lymphocytic response (p = 0.001), high lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (p<0.001) and low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001). In primary analysis with 3067 patients, there was no statistical difference in sidedness in the univariate analysis (p = 0.291). Three further subgroup analyses were performed. In the first subgroup, only stage III patients were analyzed. In the second, patients with mismatch repair deficiency were removed. In the third, additional clinicopathologic variables known to be independently prognostic were added into analysis. In all three subgroup analyses tumor sidedness was not an independent prognostic marker. Conclusions Tumor sidedness was not an independent prognostic marker of CRC. However, right sided CRCs were associated with several key independent prognostic markers supporting a hypothesis that tumor sidedness is a surrogate for other biomarkers."

Mandatory face-to-face counselling is necessary during HIV testing but difficult to implement within the context of HIV self-testing. We investigated adverse psychological effects and coping mechanisms following HIV-positive and HIV-discordant test results amongst self-tested individuals living in couples in urban Blantyre, Malawi.

Methods
Qualitative data from 35 in-depth interviews with self-tested individuals living in couples for more than 3 months were collected and analysed using thematic content analysis.

Results
Adverse psychological effects seemed to mostly occur among individuals learning for the first-time that they were HIV-positive or living in HIV-discordant relationship. Irrespective of test outcomes, women living in couples expressed difficulty making important decisions about the future of their relationships while men seemed to shoulder the emotional burden associated with feeling or being seen as responsible for introducing HIV into the relationship. Post-test psychosocial support and ascertained positive behaviour change of the perceived index partner allowed some couples to overcome adverse psychological effects linked to test results.

Conclusion
Self-tested individuals living in couples may lack collective coping capability to collaboratively manage post-test adverse events after new HIV-positive or HIV-discordant results. Psychosocial support seemed to enable couples to foster both an individual and a collective ability to manage adverse psychological effects within the context of a couple. More research is needed to ascertain the magnitude of the deficiency of collective coping competency in couples following an HIV test."

Adipose tissue has a high insulation effect and is one of the major explanatory factors of core hypothermia. Accordingly, determining the respective influence of visceral and subcutaneous fat on changes in core temperature during laparoscopic surgery is of considerable interest.We performed a prospective study of 104 consecutive donors who underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy. Temperature data were collected from anesthesia records. Visceral and subcutaneous fat were calculated by computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound. For ultrasound measurements, preperitoneal fat thickness was used as an index of visceral fat. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the surgical incision to identify the predictive factors of body temperature change. The potential explanatory valuables were age, sex, BMI, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat.BMI (β = 0.010, 95%CI: 0.001-0.019, p = 0.033) and waist-to-hip ratio (β = 0.424, 95%CI: 0.065-0.782, p = 0.021) were associated with increased core temperature at 30 minutes after the surgical incision. Ultrasound measured-preperitoneal fat was significantly associated with increased core temperature at 30 and 60 minutes after the surgical incision (β = 0.012, 95%CI: 0.003-0.021, p = 0.009 and β = 0.013, 95%CI: 0.002-0.024, p = 0.026). CT-measured visceral fat was also associated with increased core temperature at 30 minutes after the surgical incision (β = 0.005, 95%CI: 0.000-0.010, p = 0.046). Conversely, subcutaneous fat was not associated with intraoperative core temperature. Male sex and younger age were associated with lower intraoperative core temperature.Visceral fat protects against core temperature decrease during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy."

We describe a bacterial protein not previously reported to be involved in adherence, Slp, and its interactions with the human host protein polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). The human pIgR has previously been shown to act as an adherence receptor for some mucosal pathogens and is highly expressed in the intestine. Following observation of significant colocalization between E. coli O157:H7 bacteria and pIgR location on Caco-2 cells, a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay using a human recombinant Fc-tagged pIgR protein led to the identification of this protein. Disruption of Slp expression in E. coli O157:H7, through deletion of its encoding gene slp, produced a significant adherence deficiency to Caco-2 cells at early time points associated with initial adherence. Plasmid complementation of the slp gene fully restored the wild-type phenotype. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed evidence that this interaction is specific to the pathogenic strains of E. coli tested and not the nonpathogenic control strain E. coli K12. Additionally, deletion of slp gene resulted in the absence of the corresponding protein band in further Co-IP assays, while the plasmid-encoded slp gene complementation of the deletion mutant strain restored the wild-type pattern. These data support the proposal that Slp directly contributes to initial adherence, with the pIgR protein as its proposed receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2951808098,"Despite general acceptance that the retinotopic organisation of human V4 (hV4) takes the form of a single, uninterrupted ventral hemifield, measured retinotopic maps of this visual area are often incomplete. Here, we test hypotheses that artefact from draining veins close to hV4 cause inverted BOLD responses that may serve to obscure a portion of the lower visual quarterfield—including the lower vertical meridian—in some hemispheres. We further test whether correcting such responses can restore the ‘missing’ retinotopic coverage in hV4. Subjects (N = 10) viewed bowtie, ring, drifting bar and full field flash stimuli. Functional EPIs were acquired over approximately 1.5h and analysed to reveal retinotopic maps of early visual cortex, including hV4. Normalised mean maps (which show the average EPI signal amplitude) were constructed by voxel-wise averaging of the EPI time course and used to locate venous eclipses, which can be identified by a decrease in the EPI signal caused by deoxygenated blood. Inverted responses are shown to cluster in these regions and correcting these responses improves maps of hV4 in some hemispheres, including restoring a complete hemifield map in one. A leftwards bias was found whereby 6/10 left hemisphere hV4 maps were incomplete, while this was the case in only 1/10 right hemisphere maps. Incomplete hV4 maps did not correspond with venous artefact in every instance, with incomplete maps being present in the absence of a venous eclipse and complete maps coexisting with a proximate venous eclipse. We also show that mean maps of upper surfaces (near the boundary between cortical grey matter and CSF) provide highly detailed maps of veins on the cortical surface. Results suggest that venous eclipses and inverted voxels can explain some incomplete hV4 maps, but cannot explain the remainder nor the leftwards bias in hV4 coverage reported here."
https://openalex.org/W2952981732,"Background Personal cancer risk assessments enable stratified care, for example, offering preventive surgical measures such as risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) to women at high risk for breast cancer. In scenario-based experiments, we investigated whether different benefit–harm ratios of RRM influence women’s consideration of this, whether this consideration is influenced by women’s perception of and desire to know their personal cancer risk, or by their intention to take a novel cancer risk-predictive test, and whether consideration varies across different countries. Method In January 2017, 1,675 women 40 to 75 years of age from five European countries—Czech Republic, Germany, UK, Italy, and Sweden—took part in an online scenario-based experiment. Six different scenarios of hypothetical benefit–harm ratios of RRM were presented in accessible fact box formats: Baseline risk/risk reduction pairings were 20/16, 20/4, 10/8, 10/2, 5/4, and 5/1 out of 1,000 women dying from breast cancer. Results Varying the baseline risk of dying from breast cancer and the extent of risk reduction influenced the decision to consider RRM for 23% of women. Decisions varied by country, risk perception, and the intention to take a cancer risk-predictive test. Women who expressed a stronger intention to take such a test were more likely to consider having RRM. The desire to know one’s risk of developing any female cancer in general moderated women’s decisions, whereas the specific desire to know the risk of breast cancer did not. Conclusions In this hypothetical scenario-based study, only for a minority of women did the change in benefit–harm ratio inform their consideration of RRM. Because this consideration is influenced by risk perception and the intention to learn one’s cancer risks via a cancer risk-predictive test, careful disclosure of different potential preventive measures and their benefit–harm ratios is necessary before testing for individual risk. Furthermore, information on risk testing should acknowledge country-specific sensitivities for benefit–harm ratios."
https://openalex.org/W2953300256,"Recent investigations analysing synchronization in singing ensembles have shown that the precision of synchronization during singing duo performances is better in the presence of visual contact between the singers than without. Research has also shown that synchronisation improves with practice across rehearsals in a newly formed singing quintet. However, whether listeners’ perceptions of synchronization reflect the different patterns of synchronization that were observed during ensemble performance with and without visual contact and across rehearsals has not yet been investigated. This study aims to analyse the perception of the synchronization associated with altered visual contact and amount of rehearsal during singing duo and quintet performances respectively, for listeners with different levels of musical expertise. A set of fifty-eight singing recordings selected from duo and quintet ensemble performances, collected from previous investigations of interpersonal synchrony, was presented to 33 listeners, including non-experts (university students with little or no music training), performers in the group (singers who performed the pieces used for the study), and other musicians (advanced music students). Participants were required to listen to each trial and judge the level of “togetherness” on a sliding scale from zero to 100. Results show that listeners, irrespective of their musical training and performance experience, perceived differences in the synchronization in the duo tokens depending on the presence/absence of visual contact between singers; on the other hand, the smaller asynchrony patterns measured across rehearsals in the singing quintet recordings were not perceived. This study contributes to our understanding of perceptions of synchronization by individuals with different levels of musical expertise, and underscores the perceptual salience of synchronization, regardless of musical experience."
https://openalex.org/W2953387782,"There is a higher incidence of vitamin D deficiency in older adults. This may play a plausible mechanistic role in the occurrence of increased adverse events after non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). This study investigated whether total vitamin D levels at the time of presentation predicted adverse outcomes in older adults undergoing invasive management of NSTEACS. Of the 629 patients screened, 300 high-risk older adults with NSTEACS managed by an invasive strategy were recruited. Serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured at index presentation. The primary outcome was defined as 1-year composite of all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), unplanned repeat revascularisation, significant bleeding or stroke. Mean age was 80.5±4.8 years (61.9% male). Median vitamin D level was 29.5nmol/L [interquartile range IQR 16.0–53.0 nmol/L] and was split equally by the median for analysis forming two groups: high (median vitamin D 53.0 nmol/L [IQR 40.0–75.0]) and low (16.0 nmol/L [11.0–23.0]). The primary outcome occurred in 76 patients (25.9%); 32 (21.9%) in the low group and 44 (29.9%) in the high group, p = 0.12. Multivariable analyses showed no significant difference in the primary composite outcome at 1 year between the low and high group of baseline serum vitamin D (Hazard Ratio 1.20 [95% Confidence Interval 0.72–2.0], p = 0.48). Serum total vitamin D, measured at the time of angiography, was not associated with adverse outcomes at one year in this high-risk older cohort of patients with NSTEACS undergoing invasive management."
https://openalex.org/W2949582253,"With the emergence and widespread application of cloud computing, the use of cloud platforms to solve the problem of secure multi-party computation has emerged as a new research direction. The traditional computation of a solid geometry is performed through mutual interactions between two parties, which is not suitable in an untrusted cloud computing environment. In this paper, we first design a basic protocol for a secure Euclidean distance calculation that is suitable for cloud platforms and can serve as a building block for other protocols on cloud platforms. Using the solution of the Euclidean distance problem as such a building block, we provide a new method that converts the problems of calculating solid triangular areas and solid tetrahedral volumes into the calculation of distances and determinants in three-dimensional space. Then, we discuss solid point-line distance calculations, which extent the idea of the spatial geometry security problem. We present protocols for the above problems and prove that the proposed protocols can resist conspiracy among users and the untrusted cloud platform so that they can effectively ensure the privacy of the users. We also analyze the performances of these solutions. The analysis results show that our scheme is more versatile."
https://openalex.org/W2949859073,"Objective To investigate whether exposure to hyperemesis gravidarum (hyperemesis) is associated with subsequent maternal cardiovascular morbidity. Design Nationwide cohort study. Setting Medical Birth Registry of Norway (1967–2002) linked to the nationwide Cardiovascular Disease in Norway project 1994–2009 (CVDNOR) and the Cause of Death Registry. Population Women in Norway with singleton births from 1967 to 2002, with and without hyperemesis, were followed up with respect to cardiovascular outcomes from 1994 to 2009. Methods Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Main outcome measures The first hospitalisation due to nonfatal stroke, myocardial infarction or angina pectoris, or cardiovascular death. Results Among 989 473 women with singleton births, 13 212 (1.3%) suffered from hyperemesis. During follow-up, a total of 43 482 (4.4%) women experienced a cardiovascular event. No association was found between hyperemesis and the risk of a fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular event (adjusted HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.99–1.18). Women with hyperemesis had higher risk of hospitalisation due to angina pectoris (adjusted HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.15–1.44). The risk of cardiovascular death was lower among hyperemetic women in age-adjusted analysis (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.59–0.91), but the association was no longer significant when adjusting for possible confounders. Conclusion Women with a history of hyperemesis did not have increased risk of a cardiovascular event (nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, angina pectoris or cardiovascular death) compared to women without."
