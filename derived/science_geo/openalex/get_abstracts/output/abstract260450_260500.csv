Here, we describe an association between myocardial infarction (MI) and a common sequence variant on chromosome 9p21. This study included a total of 4587 cases and 12,767 controls. The identified variant, adjacent to the tumor suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B , was associated with the disease with high significance. Approximately 21% of individuals in the population are homozygous for this variant, and their estimated risk of suffering myocardial infarction is 1.64 times as great as that of noncarriers. The corresponding risk is 2.02 times as great for early-onset cases. The population attributable risk is 21% for MI in general and 31% for early-onset cases."

We used genome-wide association scanning to identify a 58-kilobase interval on chromosome 9p21 that was consistently associated with CHD in six independent samples (more than 23,000 participants) from four Caucasian populations. This interval, which is located near the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes, contains no annotated genes and is not associated with established CHD risk factors such as plasma lipoproteins, hypertension, or diabetes. Homozygotes for the risk allele make up 20 to 25% of Caucasians and have a ∼30 to 40% increased risk of CHD."

https://openalex.org/W1993901564,"The mammalian clock regulates major aspects of energy metabolism, including glucose and lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. The biochemical basis for coordinated control of the circadian clock and diverse metabolic pathways is not well understood. Here we show that PGC-1alpha (Ppargc1a), a transcriptional coactivator that regulates energy metabolism, is rhythmically expressed in the liver and skeletal muscle of mice. PGC-1alpha stimulates the expression of clock genes, notably Bmal1 (Arntl) and Rev-erbalpha (Nr1d1), through coactivation of the ROR family of orphan nuclear receptors. Mice lacking PGC-1alpha show abnormal diurnal rhythms of activity, body temperature and metabolic rate. The disruption of physiological rhythms in these animals is correlated with aberrant expression of clock genes and those involved in energy metabolism. Analyses of PGC-1alpha-deficient fibroblasts and mice with liver-specific knockdown of PGC-1alpha indicate that it is required for cell-autonomous clock function. We have thus identified PGC-1alpha as a key component of the circadian oscillator that integrates the mammalian clock and energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2072023677,"Synaptic vesicles loaded with neurotransmitters are exocytosed in a soluble N -ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)–dependent manner after presynaptic depolarization induces calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) influx. The Ca 2+ sensor required for fast fusion is synaptotagmin-1. The activation energy of bilayer-bilayer fusion is very high (≈40 k B T ). We found that, in response to Ca 2+ binding, synaptotagmin-1 could promote SNARE-mediated fusion by lowering this activation barrier by inducing high positive curvature in target membranes on C2-domain membrane insertion. Thus, synaptotagmin-1 triggers the fusion of docked vesicles by local Ca 2+ -dependent buckling of the plasma membrane together with the zippering of SNAREs. This mechanism may be widely used in membrane fusion."

https://openalex.org/W2015882075,"All higher organisms on Earth receive energy directly or indirectly from oxygenic photosynthesis performed by plants, green algae and cyanobacteria. Photosystem I (PSI) is a supercomplex of a reaction centre and light-harvesting complexes. It generates the most negative redox potential in nature, and thus largely determines the global amount of enthalpy in living systems. We report the structure of plant PSI at 3.4 A resolution, revealing 17 protein subunits. PsaN was identified in the luminal side of the supercomplex, and most of the amino acids in the reaction centre were traced. The crystal structure of PSI provides a picture at near atomic detail of 11 out of 12 protein subunits of the reaction centre. At this level, 168 chlorophylls (65 assigned with orientations for Q(x) and Q(y) transition dipole moments), 2 phylloquinones, 3 Fe(4)S(4) clusters and 5 carotenoids are described. This structural information extends the understanding of the most efficient nano-photochemical machine in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2011904570,"The ability of stem/progenitor cells to migrate and engraft into host tissues is key to their potential use in gene and cell therapy. Among the cells of interest are the adherent cells from bone marrow, referred to as mesenchymal stem cells or multipotent stromal cells (MSC). Since the bone marrow environment is hypoxic, with oxygen tensions ranging from 1% to 7%, we decided to test whether hypoxia can upregulate chemokine receptors and enhance the ability of human MSCs to engraft in vivo. Short-term exposure of MSCs to 1% oxygen increased expression of the chemokine receptors CX3CR1and CXCR4, both as mRNA and as protein. After 1-day exposure to low oxygen, MSCs increased in vitro migration in response to the fractalkine and SDF-1α in a dose dependent manner. Blocking antibodies for the chemokine receptors significantly decreased the migration. Xenotypic grafting into early chick embryos demonstrated cells from hypoxic cultures engrafted more efficiently than cells from normoxic cultures and generated a variety of cell types in host tissues. The results suggest that short-term culture of MSCs under hypoxic conditions may provide a general method of enhancing their engraftment in vivo into a variety of tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2087632492,"Planning for a possible influenza pandemic is an extremely high priority, as social and economic effects of an unmitigated pandemic would be devastating. Mathematical models can be used to explore different scenarios and provide insight into potential costs, benefits, and effectiveness of prevention and control strategies under consideration.A stochastic, equation-based epidemic model is used to study global transmission of pandemic flu, including the effects of travel restrictions and vaccination. Economic costs of intervention are also considered. The distribution of First Passage Times (FPT) to the United States and the numbers of infected persons in metropolitan areas worldwide are studied assuming various times and locations of the initial outbreak. International air travel restrictions alone provide a small delay in FPT to the U.S. When other containment measures are applied at the source in conjunction with travel restrictions, delays could be much longer. If in addition, control measures are instituted worldwide, there is a significant reduction in cases worldwide and specifically in the U.S. However, if travel restrictions are not combined with other measures, local epidemic severity may increase, because restriction-induced delays can push local outbreaks into high epidemic season. The per annum cost to the U.S. economy of international and major domestic air passenger travel restrictions is minimal: on the order of 0.8% of Gross National Product.International air travel restrictions may provide a small but important delay in the spread of a pandemic, especially if other disease control measures are implemented during the afforded time. However, if other measures are not instituted, delays may worsen regional epidemics by pushing the outbreak into high epidemic season. This important interaction between policy and seasonality is only evident with a global-scale model. Since the benefit of travel restrictions can be substantial while their costs are minimal, dismissal of travel restrictions as an aid in dealing with a global pandemic seems premature."

https://openalex.org/W1976370241,"Solar gravity modes have been actively sought because they directly probe the solar core (below 0.2 solar radius), but they have not been conclusively detected in the Sun because of their small surface amplitudes. Using data from the Global Oscillation at Low Frequency instrument, we detected a periodic structure in agreement with the period separation predicted by the theory for gravity dipole modes. When studied in relation to simulations including the best physics of the Sun determined through the acoustic modes, such a structure favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the rest of the radiative zone."
https://openalex.org/W2011831296,"Alterations in DNA methylation in cancer include global hypomethylation and gene-specific hypermethylation. It is not clear whether these two epigenetic errors are mechanistically linked or occur independently. This study was performed to determine the relationship between DNA hypomethylation, hypermethylation and microsatellite instability in cancer.We examined 61 cancer cell lines and 60 colorectal carcinomas and their adjacent tissues using LINE-1 bisulfite-PCR as a surrogate for global demethylation. Colorectal carcinomas with sporadic microsatellite instability (MSI), most of which are due to a CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) and associated MLH1 promoter methylation, showed in average no difference in LINE-1 methylation between normal adjacent and cancer tissues. Interestingly, some tumor samples in this group showed increase in LINE-1 methylation. In contrast, MSI-showed a significant decrease in LINE-1 methylation between normal adjacent and cancer tissues (P<0.001). Microarray analysis of repetitive element methylation confirmed this observation and showed a high degree of variability in hypomethylation between samples. Additionally, unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified a group of highly hypomethylated tumors, composed mostly of tumors without microsatellite instability. We extended LINE-1 analysis to cancer cell lines from different tissues and found that 50/61 were hypomethylated compared to peripheral blood lymphocytes and normal colon mucosa. Interestingly, these cancer cell lines also exhibited a large variation in demethylation, which was tissue-specific and thus unlikely to be resultant from a stochastic process.Global hypomethylation is partially reversed in cancers with microsatellite instability and also shows high variability in cancer, which may reflect alternative progression pathways in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2059536794,"Background The lone star tick Amblyomma americanum is a common pest and vector of infectious diseases for humans and other mammals in the southern and eastern United States. A Coxiella sp. bacterial endosymbiont was highly prevalent in both laboratory-reared and field-collected A. americanum. The Coxiella sp. was demonstrated in all stages of tick and in greatest densities in nymphs and adult females, while a Rickettsia sp. was less prevalent and in lower densities when present. Methodology/Principal Findings We manipulated the numbers of both bacterial species in laboratory-reared A. americanum by injecting engorged nymphs or engorged, mated females with single doses of an antibiotic (rifampin or tetracycline) or buffer alone. Burdens of the bacteria after molting or after oviposition were estimated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction with primers and probes specific for each bacterial species or, as an internal standard, the host tick. Post-molt adult ticks that had been treated with rifampin or tetracycline had lower numbers of the Coxiella sp. and Rickettsia sp. and generally weighed less than ticks that received buffer alone. Similarly, after oviposition, females treated previously with either antibiotic had lower burdens of both bacterial species in comparison to controls. Treatment of engorged females with either antibiotic was associated with prolonged time to oviposition, lower proportions of ticks that hatched, lower proportions of viable larvae among total larvae, and lower numbers of viable larvae per tick. These fitness estimators were associated with reduced numbers of the Coxiella sp. but not the Rickettsia sp. Conclusion/Significance The findings indicate that the Coxiella sp. is a primary endosymbiont, perhaps provisioning the obligately hematophagous parasites with essential nutrients. The results also suggest that antibiotics could be incorporated into an integrated pest management plan for control of these and other tick vectors of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2023714309,"Most birds have simple genitalia; males lack external genitalia and females have simple vaginas. However, male waterfowl have a phallus whose length (1.5–>40 cm) and morphological elaborations vary among species and are positively correlated with the frequency of forced extra-pair copulations among waterfowl species. Here we report morphological complexity in female genital morphology in waterfowl and describe variation vaginal morphology that is unprecedented in birds. This variation comprises two anatomical novelties: (i) dead end sacs, and (ii) clockwise coils. These vaginal structures appear to function to exclude the intromission of the counter-clockwise spiralling male phallus without female cooperation. A phylogenetically controlled comparative analysis of 16 waterfowl species shows that the degree of vaginal elaboration is positively correlated with phallus length, demonstrating that female morphological complexity has co-evolved with male phallus length. Intersexual selection is most likely responsible for the observed coevolution, although identifying the specific mechanism is difficult. Our results suggest that females have evolved a cryptic anatomical mechanism of choice in response to forced extra-pair copulations."

G1, intra-S, and G2/M checkpoints operate to block cells at different cell cycle stages (1Lydall D. Weinert T. Science. 1995; 270: 1488-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). G1 checkpoint prevents G1 cells from entering S phase with damaged DNA (2Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 3Lukas J. Lukas C. Bartek J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), which operates in two distinct phases in response to ionizing radiation (IR): an initial rapid response, typically within 4 h after IR (4Agami R. Bernards R. Cell. 2000; 102: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and a sustained response that operates from 4 to 24 h after IR (2Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). While the sustained G1 arrest is mediated by p53-dependent transcription, the rapid G1 arrest is p53-independent and is poorly understood. While many proteins that regulate intra-S and G2/M checkpoints have been identified, the number of proteins known to participate in G1 checkpoint is very limited. Central to DDR are the two checkpoint kinases, ATM and ATR, that phosphorylate the effector kinases Chk1 and Chk2 and other downstream effectors (5Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). ATM/ATR substrates execute DDR directly or indirectly and are the keys for the understanding of this response. The identification of p53, NBS1, BRCA1, Chk1/Chk2, and SMC1 as substrates of ATM/ATR has significantly advanced our understanding of DDR (6Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K.

A thorough understanding of DDR in mammalian cells awaits the identification of new ATM/ATR substrates. Unfortunately, few techniques are available today to systematically identify in vivo substrates of protein kinase. ATM and ATR kinases preferentially phosphorylates the S/TQ motif as a consensus sequence (13Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). It has been observed that a phospho-specific antibody raised against a phosphopeptide is not strictly site or sequence specific; it also recognizes other proteins (cross-reacting proteins) with similar sequences flanking the phosphorylation site. It has been recently realized that these cross-reacting proteins could also be substrates of the same kinase (14Shi Y. Dodson G.E. Mukhopadhyay P.S. Shanware N.P. Trinh A.T. Tibbetts R.S. J. Biol.

See supplemental material I for “Experimental Procedures” (18Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Jung S.Y.

To screen for putative ATM/ATR substrates, we used phospho-antibodies raised against known ATM/ATR substrates that recognize pSQ motifs to immunoprecipitate potential new substrates. HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared from cycling cells and from those treated with IR and hydroxyurea (HU), conditions that activate ATM and ATR, respectively. Each lane of Coomassie Blue-stained gels was divided into 12 regions and proteins in each region were identified with mass spectrometry (MS). As shown as an example in Fig. 1a, structure maintenance of chromosomes 1 and 3 (SMC1/3) migrating at 170 and 150 kDa, respectively, are the most abundant proteins recognized by the ATM-pS1981 antibody (21Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). Many proteins were identified from cycling cells and IR- or HU-treated cells (supplemental Table I). Similar experiments were carried out with antibodies against phospho-BRCA1 (pS1387, pS1423, and pS1457), and the results are summarized in supplemental Table I. It is possible that some proteins identified using this approach were co-precipitated by association with phosphorylated proteins. To minimize precipitation of associated proteins, we used radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing high detergent concentration to wash the immunoprecipitates extensively to disrupt the weak interactions. Thus, proteins identified by this method represent both potential ATM/ATR substrates and core components of the complex that associate with the substrates and have survived the stringent wash. For example, SMC1 was co-precipitated by its strong interaction with SMC3, the substrate recognized by ATM-pS1981 antibody (Fig. 1, A and B). Since interaction between two protein complexes is usually transient, the identification of protein complexes from different functional categories suggests that one or more proteins in each category are recognized by the phospho-antibodies as potential ATM/ATR substrates, and other core components in each protein complex come along with the substrate. We used the following criteria to validate the identified proteins as ATM/ATR substrates. First, they must be phospho-proteins; second, they are phosphorylated in an IR/HU-inducible and ATM/ATR-dependent manner; and third, they must contain sequences similar to the SQ peptides used to raise the phospho-antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, when the lysate was treated with calf intestine phosphatase (CIP), no band was recognized by ATM-pS1981 antibody by Western blotting, demonstrating that all bands correspond to phospho-proteins. Furthermore, most of the proteins were phosphorylated in an IR- and HU-inducible manner (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine the identity of the protein band and to test whether the phospho-Western blot signal is ATM-dependent, we transfected siRNAs against ATM and the candidate protein that has a similar molecular weight to the protein band identified by immunoprecipitation/MS (supplemental Table 1). The cell lysate was analyzed by Western blotting of duplicate blots with either the phospho-antibody or a specific antibody against the candidate protein. As shown in Fig. 2A, the knockdown of either ATM or ARFBP1 reduced the p480 phospho-signal, suggesting that p480 is ARFBP1 and that this protein is phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner; this is confirmed by the reduction of the Western blotting signal of ARFBP1 on the duplicate membrane. Using this approach, we found that ARFBP1, USP34, KIAA1794, SMC3, TAOK3, and TDP1 are phosphorylated in an IR-and HU-inducible and ATM/ATR-dependent manner. Analyses of amino acid sequences of these proteins reveal that they often contain a stretch of at least 4 amino acid residues or multiple stretches of 3 amino acid resides surrounding the SQ site that are identical to the phosphopeptide antigen, suggesting that these sequences are recognized by the phospho-antibodies employed in this study. Thus, these proteins are most likely to be ATM/ATR substrates (Table 1). The protein band p250 is identified as TRAP220, but its phosphorylation is neither dependent on ATM/ATR nor IR/HU-inducible. Thus, some proteins cross-reacting to phospho-antibodies are not ATM/ATR substrates.TABLE 1Comparison of phospho-specific antibody epitopes with sequences within the identified cross-reacting proteins (S/T, D/E, and I/L are treated as the same residue in the analysis)ProteinATM, pS1981, EGSQSTBRCA1, pS1387, LSSQSDBRCA1, pS1457, LTSQKSRad18HFSQSKRNF20LQSQSS, LSSQSSLQSQSS, LSSQSSRNF40LKSQVD, LRSQALRFWD3VSSQGV, ISSQATARFBP1/ HUWEWGSQLG, CSSQSS, ESSQSELSSQEM, CSSQSS, ESSQSELSSQEM, ATSQAG, VASQKREDD1LGSQPQ, LISQAQ, SSSQSQ, SSSQSS, SSSQSD, LASQSSZBTB2LASQGA, TSSQQEBTBD12CSSQTQ, LASQTY, LSSQSSSRSQKS, LASQTY, LSSQSSUSP15ENSQSEUSP28SSSQDV, SSSQDY, STSQEPSSSQDV, SSSQDY, STSQEPUSP34DASQTT, QGSQESVCPSLSQSNIVSQLL, SLSQSNIVSQLLBAT3LSSQTS, LDSQTRLDSQTR, LSSQTSLDSQTR, LSSQTSKIAA1794LSSQEE, SSSQCS, ASSQAT, QCSQSL, DFSQST,SMC3GGSQSS,GGSQSSGGSQSSTAOK3TGSQSS,TGSQSS, LESQKK,TDP1SGSQED, QGSQKD, AGSQEPRIF1LESQESTRAP220GHSQST, LNSQSQ, SQSQSG, ESSQSG, NSSQSG, SGSQGP, GSSQSKESSQSG, NSSQSG YSSQGS, GSSQSK Open table in a new tab Some of the candidate proteins identified from the immunoprecipitation/MS analysis are not recognized by the same phospho-antibody in Western blots. To demonstrate that they are potential ATM/ATR substrates, we immunoprecipitated these proteins with the phospho-antibody and Western blotted with antibodies specific to these proteins. Using this method, we found that RFWD3 is phosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner in response to HU (Fig. 2B), and RIF1 and VCP are phosphorylated in an ATM-dependant manner in response to IR (Fig. 2C). Substrates validated by this method could be associated proteins, but since they have survived the stringent wash and all contain sequences similar to the peptide antigen, thus it is equally possible that they are kinase substrates. Using both approaches demonstrated in Fig. 2, we validated nine ATM/ATR substrates among our collection of candidates. We conclude that the above approach is capable of finding ATM/ATR substrates. The large number of potential ATM/ATR substrates identified in the proteomic screen poses a significant challenge for functional characterization. When we categorized the proteins into functional modules based on the known function or functional motifs in these proteins, we found many proteins involved in DDR, DNA repair, chromosomal cohesion, and transcriptional regulation, which are expected from ATM/ATR substrates (supplemental Table I). We also found that proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are overrepresented (Table 1). This suggests the involvement of protein ubiquitylation in DNA damage response, a notion that is well known in yeast and begins to be appreciated in mammalian cells. The UPS proteins include E3 ubiquitin ligases (Rad18, RNF20, RNF40, RFWD3, ARFBP1, EDD1), BTB domain proteins (ZBTB2 and BTBD12) that may recruit protein degradation targets to E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (22Honda Y.

Importantly, these proteins also contain stretches of amino acid sequences flanking the SQ sites that are similar to the phospho-antigens (Table 1), and the number of peptides detected in MS increases when cells are treated with IR or HU, suggesting that they are potential ATM/ATR substrates or at least tightly associated with the substrates. We thus focused our subproteome functional characterization on 10 UPS proteins for their roles in DNA damage response (Fig. 3). If these candidates are bode fide ATM/ATR substrates, they may participate in regulation of DNA damage checkpoint, DNA repair, or apoptosis. Ideally, we would like to map the precise phosphorylation sites of these candidates and test the loss-of-function mutants for their functions. Unfortunately, it is too labor intensive for a single lab to carry out such analysis on 10 proteins. We decided to examine whether the UPS proteins are required to regulate DNA damage checkpoints. We carried out intra-S and G2/M checkpoint assays in HeLa cells depleted of these genes using siRNA. In response to IR, the intra-S checkpoint is activated to mainly suppress late origin firing and is measured by a temporary decrease of nucleotide incorporation following IR. Three days after siRNA knockdown, we irradiated the cells with 10-Gy IR and measured nucleotide incorporation 1 h post-irradiation. Of the 10 genes tested, six exhibited radio-resistant DNA synthesis significantly above a control siRNA (siVim) transfected cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that these UPS proteins are required to regulate the intra-S phase checkpoint. The G2/M checkpoint is activated to prevent cells with damaged DNA from entering mitosis. We irradiated siRNA-transfected cells with 10-Gy IR and measured the mitotic index 1 h post irradiation. The population of histone H3-pS10 positive cells, which correspond to mitotic cells, was visualized using a microscope. Knocking down 2 out of the 10 genes leads to a profound G2/M checkpoint failure that cells accumulate more than 4 times as many mitotic cells as in control transfected cells (compare >30% with 7.5% relative mitotic index for control transfected cells). Interestingly, siRNA transfection of ZBTB2 causes a marked increase in mitotic index before IR and virtually no further decrease after IR, indicating that ZBTB2 may play an essential role in mitotic progression, which complicates the interpretation of its role in G2/M checkpoint control. The G1 checkpoint arrests cells with damaged DNA at the G1/S boundary. G1 checkpoint is the least understood checkpoint among the DNA damage checkpoints, at least in part due to the lack of an accurate and sensitive assay. Current G1 checkpoint assay, which measures G1 accumulation by flow cytometry, is unable to accurately measure cell cycle progression immediately after DNA damage induction. We developed an imaging-based G1 checkpoint assay by pulse-labeling cells with two bromodeoxyuridine analogs at various times before and after DNA damage induction. By distinguishing cells that have entered S phase after DNA damage induction from the replicating cells at the time of damage induction, this assay allows for accurate measurement of G1-S transition with a better time resolution. We have validated this assay by measuring the G1 arrest of known checkpoint proteins and confirmed the existence of p53-independent rapid response (within 4 h post-IR) and p53-dependent sustained arrest (after 4 h). 4Y. Wang and J. Qin, submitted for publication. We used this assay to examine in details whether the UPS genes are involved in both rapid and sustained G1 arrest in U2OS cells. We first pulse-labeled the cells with CldU to mark the starting point and then labeled them with IdU 4 h later to mark the end point. Using CldU- and IdU-specific antibodies, we scored cells that were CldU-negative and IdU-positive as having entered S phase during the 4 h period after IR. We calculated the S phase entry as the percentage of CldU-negative and IdU-positive cells among DAPI-stained cells. By comparing relative S phase entry (ratio of S phase entry after and before IR in the 4 h period) between 0–4 h, 4–8 h, and 8–12 h following 10-Gy IR, we evaluated the G1 checkpoint in U2OS cells depleted of USP genes by siRNA transfection. In control siRNA-transfected cells, relative S phase entry is decreased to 60% during the first 4 h after IR as a result of rapid G1 checkpoint activation and is further decreased to and maintained below 20% starting from 4 h after IR. Of the 10 genes tested, 7 genes are required to regulate the rapid G1 checkpoint 4 h after IR, and 6 genes are required to regulate the sustained G1 arrest (Fig. 3C). Up to now, only Cyclin D1 degradation has been shown to regulate the rapid G1 response (4Agami R. Bernards R. Cell. 2000; 102: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and Cdc25A is implicated in this process by biochemical evidence (31Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 32Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Our screen therefore has significantly increased the number of potential G1 checkpoint regulators and reinforced the notion that protein degradation is an important mechanism for the rapid G1 arrest. Moreover, the finding that UPS proteins are also required for sustained G1 arrest thus expands its regulators beyond p53-p21CIP. It is conceivable that the UPS may regulate the sustained G1 arrest through p53-dependent transcriptional program as transcription co-regulators or through other novel pathways yet to be discovered. Detailed mechanistic insights await the identification of substrates of the UPS proteins. As summarized in Fig. 3D, 9 of 10 UPS genes tested are required for at least one cell cycle checkpoint, and 1 gene, ARFBP1, regulates three checkpoints. Our checkpoint assays utilize siRNA pools that are composed of four sequences to maximize knockdown, the possibility of off-target effect cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, the high success rate for identifying checkpoint genes demonstrates that a proteomic screen for ATM/ATR substrates combined with a functional screen is highly effective in selecting protein candidates for further elucidation of the signaling pathways mediated by ATM/ATR. The use of large number of phospho-SQ antibodies to screen for ATM/ATR substrates has revealed an extensive network of proteins in DNA damage response. 5S. J. Elledge, personal communication. When combined with functional categorization and application of functional screens for checkpoint, DNA repair or apoptosis, potential substrates as listed in supplemental Table I can be similarly screened and placed into different pathways in the ATM/ATR-regulated DNA damage response network, expending the conceptual framework of DNA damage response. Our report is an example of applying this strategy to reveal the involvement of UPS among the ATM/ATR substrates in mammalian checkpoint control.

https://openalex.org/W2009577344,"Ferromagnets are everywhere, but ferromagnetism itself is a rare property. The more subtle cousins, antiferromagnets, are more common, but have been recognized for less than 100 years and have only become technologically relevant in the past 20 years. One reason for this is the unavailability of the analogues of ferromagnetic domains — the bar magnets that a larger ferromagnet divides into. Using a new technique, X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, it is now possible to examine the nanometre-scale superstructure of spin- and charge-density in the antiferromagnet chromium, and the results could lead to magnetic engineering techniques that bring antiferromagnets into wider use. The new technique shows that the antiferromagnetic domain walls are in fact never at rest, but are constantly advancing and retreating over micrometre distances. And though domain wall motion is thermally activated at temperatures above 100K, it is not so at lower temperatures, and on cooling below 40K the motion saturates at a finite value consistent with quantum fluctuations. A new X-ray-based technique, X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, is developed to directly measure magnetic noise. Its use is demonstrated for elemental chromium, an antiferromagnet that displays a nanometre-scale superstructure of spin- and charge-density. Fingerprints of a particular magnetic domain configuration are obtained, and after the temporal evolution of the patterns, magnetic domain walls advancing and retreating over micron distances are observed. Measurements of magnetic noise emanating from ferromagnets owing to domain motion were first carried out nearly 100 years ago1, and have underpinned much science and technology2,3. Antiferromagnets, which carry no net external magnetic dipole moment, yet have a periodic arrangement of the electron spins extending over macroscopic distances, should also display magnetic noise. However, this must be sampled at spatial wavelengths of the order of several interatomic spacings, rather than the macroscopic scales characteristic of ferromagnets. Here we present a direct measurement of the fluctuations in the nanometre-scale superstructure of spin- and charge-density waves associated with antiferromagnetism in elemental chromium. The technique used is X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, where coherent X-ray diffraction produces a speckle pattern that serves as a ‘fingerprint’ of a particular magnetic domain configuration. The temporal evolution of the patterns corresponds to domain walls advancing and retreating over micrometre distances. This work demonstrates a useful measurement tool for antiferromagnetic domain wall engineering, but also reveals a fundamental finding about spin dynamics in the simplest antiferromagnet: although the domain wall motion is thermally activated at temperatures above 100 K, it is not so at lower temperatures, and indeed has a rate that saturates at a finite value—consistent with quantum fluctuations—on cooling below 40 K."

CatSpers are most closely related to the six-transmembrane (TM) 2The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; CaV, voltage-gated Ca2+ channel; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HSP, heat shock protein; ICatSper, CatSper channel current; NaV, voltage-gated Na+ channel; ORF, open reading frame; WT, wild-type. voltage-gated sodium channel (NaVBP) in bacteria, with the next closest relatives being the large mammalian CaV and NaV channels (13Clapham D.E. Garbers D.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CatSpers contain positively charged amino acids interspersed within their S4 transmembrane segments, suggesting they are voltage-sensitive channel subunits. CatSper1 is relatively unique and contains a remarkable abundance of histidine residues in its amino terminus, perhaps related to the known pH sensitivity of the CatSper Ca2+ current (14Kirichok Y. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2006; 439: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). CatSpers are also present in sea urchin and the ascidian Ciona intestinalis (15Okamura Y. Nishino A. Murata Y. Nakajo K. Iwasaki H. Ohtsuka Y. Tanaka-Kunishima M. Takahashi N. Hara Y. Yoshida T. Nishida M. Okado H. Watari H. Meinertzhagen I.A. Satoh N. Takahashi K. Satou Y. Okada Y. Mori Y. Physiol.

Although mutant mouse mating behavior, sperm count, and sperm cell morphology were indistinguishable from wild type (WT) mice, mutant sperm motility was abnormal. These sperm had reduced basal velocity and lacked vigorous beating and bending in the tail region. Mutant spermatozoa failed to fertilize intact eggs but could fertilize those in which their outer layers had been enzymatically removed (9Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that CatSper null sperm cells could not be hyperactivated under physiological conditions (16Carlson A.E. Westenbroek R.E. Quill T. Ren D. Clapham D.E. Hille B. Garbers D.L.

Interestingly, depolarization evoked an increase in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in WT sperm cells, but not in CatSper1 null spermatozoa (16Carlson A.E. Westenbroek R.E. Quill T. Ren D. Clapham D.E.

The phenotype of CatSper2, 3, and 4-/- mice was indistinguishable from CatSper1-/- mice, and their sperm also lacked the hyperactivated motility needed for fertilization (12Qi H. Moran M.M.

Finally, CatSper genes appear to have similarly important roles in human fertility. Subfertile men with deficient sperm cell motility had significantly reduced expression of CatSper1 (19Nikpoor P. Mowla S.J. Movahedin M. Ziaee S.A. Tiraihi T. Hum. Reprod. 2004; 19: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). CatSper2 has been implicated by linkage analysis in human asthenoteratozoospermia (20Avidan N. Tamary H. Dgany O. Cattan D. Pariente A. Thulliez M. Borot N. Moati L. Barthelme A. Shalmon L.

Despite the essential roles of CatSper proteins in sperm Ca2+ signaling and mammalian fertilization, detailed biophysical and structure-function studies have been hindered by the lack of function in heterologous expression systems essential for these studies. None of the four mammalian CatSper channel subunits expressed in heterologous expression systems, alone (HEK293 cells, Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells) or in combination (Xenopus oocytes) (9Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), 3D. Ren and J. Xia, unpublished observations. produced detectable ICatSper. Similarly, two CatSper homologs from sea urchin testis and two from ascidian C. intestinalis did not yield current when expressed in mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes.3 In contrast, the functions of the majority of the several hundred channels (K+, Cl-, Ca2+, Na+, CNG (cyclic nucleotide-gated), and transient receptor potential (TRP)) found in somatic cells have been faithfully reproduced in heterologous systems (21Hille, B. (2001) Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes, 3rd Ed., Sunderland, MAGoogle Scholar, 22Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Sci. STKE 2004. 2004; : re15Google Scholar). One potential reason for the failure of functional heterologous expression is the lack of auxiliary subunits needed for proper channel trafficking, assembly, or gating. In this report, we describe a transgenic strategy to purify proteins associating with CatSper1. We found that a partial CatSper1 complex contained HSP70-2, a testis-specific HSP70 protein, and a novel transmembrane protein, CatSperβ. Transgenic Animal Generation—Animal protocols followed approved institutional regulations and guidelines. The CatSper1-/- mouse was previously described (9Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). A BAC clone containing the mouse CatSper1 gene (isolated from an sv129 genomic DNA library) was used to engineer a transgenic construct containing a genomic DNA fragment (∼4 kb; from an NheI site) 5′ to the CatSper1 open reading frame (ORF), and a fragment of ∼9 kb covering the whole ORF, and 0.5 kb 3′ to the ORF. A HA-eGFP fusion gene without a stop codon was synthesized by PCR using an eGFP vector (Clontech) as template. This mini-gene was inserted in-frame with the CatSper1 ORF (see Fig. 1 for detail). All fragments generated using PCR were sequenced to ensure that no unintended mutations were introduced. The insert, cloned in the pBluescript II SK vector (Stratagene), was excised, gel-purified, and used for pronuclear injection (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). Founders carrying the transgene were identified by PCR. Males from two independent lines were subsequently crossed to CatSper1-/- females in order to engineer lines carrying the transgene but lacking WT CatSper1. Mice homozygous for the insertion were generated by crossing hemizygous mice and selected by semi-quantitative genomic PCR and mating tests. Ca2+ Imaging—Ca2+ imaging was as previously described (9Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Briefly, caudal sperm were collected, loaded with Fura-2, and seeded onto coverslips coated with Cell-Tak (BD Biosciences). The ratiometric dye Fura-2 was used to minimize contributions from GFP in the transgenic sperm. Signals collected in the head region were analyzed. Imaging and analysis employed an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX-71; Olympus) with monochromator (DeltaRAM V; PTI), a cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAP HQ; Roper Scientific), data acquisition system, and control software (ImageMaster; PTI). Only cells that were evenly loaded with dye and motile were chosen for analysis (T = 20-25 °C). Sperm Whole-cell Patch Clamp Recordings—Sperm whole-cell patch clamp recordings followed previously described methods (14Kirichok Y. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2006; 439: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Corpus epididymal sperm were collected from 3-7-month-old mice. Giga seals were formed between glass pipettes (7-10 MΩ) and the cell membrane of sperm cytoplasmic droplets. Pipette solutions contained (in mm) 135 cesiummethanesulfonate, 5 CsCl, 5 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 5 Na2ATP, and 0.5 Na2GTP (pH 7.2 with CsOH). HS bath solution contained (in mm) 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgSO4, 20 HEPES, 5 glucose, 10 lactic acid, and 1 pyruvic acid (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). Divalent-free Na+ bath solution contained (in mm) 150 sodium gluconate, 20 HEPES, 5 HEDTA (pH 7.4 with NaOH). In the absence of extracellular divalent ions, CatSper channels became permeable to monovalent cations (14Kirichok Y. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2006; 439: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), leading to an apparent reversal potential of ∼0 mV in Fig. 2A. Recordings were made with an Axopatch 200B amplifier controlled by pCLAMP8.2 software through a Digidata 1322A interface (Axon). Signals were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 5 kHz. Protein Purification—All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Frozen testes were homogenized in binding buffer (1.5 ml/testis) containing 50 mm NaH2PO4 and 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, supplemented with EDTA-free proteinase inhibitor mixture (protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC); Roche Applied Science). The homogenate was spun at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 50 min to obtain the microsomal fraction. ∼100 mg of protein was solubilized for 1 h in 40 ml of buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 1× detergent and EDTA-free PIC, pH 8.0. Detergent contained 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS (radioimmune precipitation buffer) in one large scale purification, but only 1% Nonidet P-40 in several other such purifications. Following a 15-min spin, the supernatant was added to 1.5 ml of buffer-equilibrated cobalt resin and 1.6 ml of imidazole (1 m, pH 7.5), resulting in a final imidazole concentration of 37 mm. The large number of histidine residues in the amino terminus enabled CatSper1 to bind cobalt (9Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). After mixing 1 h, unbound protein was washed 2× using the same binding buffer supplemented with 40 mm imidazole, followed by wash in pH 6.5 buffer. Bound protein was eluted (22 °C) with 3 ml of elution buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 1× detergent, and EDTA-free PIC, pH 7.0. The eluate was concentrated to ∼0.7 ml (YM-100; Centricon) and the 0.7 ml of concentrate added to 100 μl of buffer-equilibrated anti-HA affinity beads (Roche Applied Science) and 3.3 ml of IP buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1× EDTA-free PIC, 0.5× detergent, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, mixed × 2 h, and washed 3× with IP buffer. Bound protein was eluted with 200 μl of HA peptide (5 mg/ml in IP buffer) for 15 min at 37 °C. The eluate was concentrated and resuspended in an lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) gel loading buffer (Invitrogen). Samples were heated for 15 min at 70 °C before being loaded onto a 4-12% Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis in SDS denaturing buffer, the gel was fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue (R-250) or silver stain for scaled down pilot purifications. Protein bands were excised and stored in 1% acetic acid before protein identification. Protein Identification—Peptides from in-gel trypsin digestion were separated on a C18 column with a nano liquid chromatography system (Eksigent) and subsequently sequenced online using a nanospray/Qstar-XL mass spectrometer (ABI). Analyst QS software was used for data analysis and Mascot for data base searches (University of Pennsylvania Proteomics Facility). Cloning of CatSperβ—The 12 peptide sequences (covering 109 amino acids) identified by mass spectrometry were used to search expressed sequence tag and genomic databases. Primers were designed according to the available sequences and used to amplify the whole ORF from mouse testis first strand cDNA by PCR. PCR products were subcloned into a modified pTracer-CMV2 vector (Invitrogen) and multiple clones sequenced. Sequences were blasted against cDNA and genome data bases to ensure that the clones selected for further analysis were free of mutations. The start of the ORF was unambiguously determined by the presence of an inframe stop codon in the 5′-untranslated region. The predicted sequences of the human and C. intestinalis CatSperβ homologs were from NCBI data bases and the C. intestinalis cDNA data base (23Inaba K. Padma P. Satouh Y. Shin I.T. Kohara Y. Satoh N. Satou Y. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 62: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Multiple Tissue Reverse Transcription PCR—PCR was performed according to standard protocols using commercial multiple panel cDNAs (Clontech) as templates. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers for CatSperβ amplification were (5′ to 3′) AGGTTCATCGTTTCAAGTTTCCAGTCAC and ACAGTTGTACTTGAGGTGAGTCCAG, respectively. Samples were denatured for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 35-cycle amplification, denature (20 s at 94 °C), annealing (20 s at 58 °C), and extension (30 s at 72 °C). Reactions were incubated at 72 °C for 10 min. Aliquots withdrawn from the reactions at 30 amplification cycles were also analyzed. Comparison between products after 30 and 35 cycles indicated no saturation. Mouse G3PDH gene was used as control for cDNA input. In Situ Hybridization—Frozen mouse testis sections (∼10-μm thick) were used for in situ staining. Single strand, digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were synthesized from the double strand DNA templates (nucleotides 1940-3323) generated using PCR with primers attached to a T7 sequence. This fragment had no significant sequence similarity to other genes. A sense probe was used as a negative control. Hybridizations were washed, and signals were visualized using alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate. Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Unless otherwise stated, pre-cast 4-12% Bis-Tris gradient gels without SDS (from Invitrogen) were used for electrophoresis. All the gels were run in electrophoresis buffer containing SDS. A fragment encoding amino acids 648-984 was cloned into the vector pET-32(a) and used for bacterial expression. The fusion protein was purified under denaturing condition and used for antibody production in rabbits. Because CatSperβ is only expressed in testis, anti-CatSperβ sera were preabsorpted against Sepharose beads conjugated with total protein from mouse brain and kidney to minimize non-specificity. Preabsorpted sera were used at 1:2000 for Western blots. Immunostaining—Sperm were placed on coverslips and fixed with cold methanol at -20 °C for 10 min, followed by acetone for 1 min. Fixed sperm were blocked with 10% normal goat sera in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and incubated with anti-CatSperβ serum (1:50) at 4 °C overnight. After being washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, coverslips were incubated with Alex 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (4 μg/ml) at 22 °C for 1 h and washed three times for 5 min each. Washed coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol with anti-fade reagent and visualized under a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope. WT and CatSper1-/-sperm were processed identically. Transgenic Approach to CatSper1 Complex Purification—Native ion channel plasma membrane proteins are of low abundance, requiring immunoprecipitation methods. Our anti-CatSper1 antibodies worked well for immunoblotting and immunostaining (9Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), but not for immunoprecipitation. To circumvent this problem we generated mice transgenic for CatSper1-HA·GFP on the CatSper1-/- background. The mouse CatSper1 ORF covers 12 exons spanning ∼9 kb; an HA epitope-tagged green fluorescence protein (HA·eGFP) encoding a mini ORF was inserted into the CatSper1 genomic DNA, immediately 5′ of the translational start site (Fig. 1, A and B). A genomic DNA fragment of ∼4kb 5′ of the first exon was used to drive the expression of the synthetic fusion gene. We established two independent lines with the transgene in the CatSper1-/- background (Fig. 1C). Both these lines were fertile, suggesting that the HA·eGFP·CatSper1 fusion protein fully rescued WT CatSper1 function. We did not observe any gross abnormality in the transgenic mice for a period of >4 years. This transgenic rescue experiment further confirmed that the male sterile phenotype in the CatSper1-/- mice was caused by the deficiency in the CatSper1 gene, but not by any potential spurious mutations introduced in the process of mutant generation. Normal alkalinization-activated, voltage-dependent ICatSper (Fig. 2) was recorded from HA·eGFP transgenic mouse epididymal sperm (n = 7), but was absent in all CatSper1-/- sperm (Ref. 14Kirichok Y. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2006; 439: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar and not shown). Fusion of the GFP protein to the amino terminus of CatSper1 did not abrogate the pH sensitivity of ICatSper, because intracellular alkalization (induced by bath application of NH4Cl) readily potentiated ICatSper current (Fig. 2A). Membrane-permeant nucleotides increase [Ca2+]i by an unknown process requiring CatSper1 expression (9Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 24Wiesner B. Weiner J. Middendorff R. Hagen V. Kaupp U.B. Weyand I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), although not via direct nucleotide activation of the CatSper channel (14Kirichok Y. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2006; 439: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In HA·eGFP·CatSper1 transgenic sperm, application of cell-permeable cGMP (8-Br-cGMP, 2 mm) elicited an increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2B). Finally, based on observations from >100 litters over 4 years, the transgenic mice were fertile. Taken together, these data suggest that the HA·eGFP·CatSper1 fusion gene functionally replaced the native CatSper1. Commercial antibodies that efficiently precipitated the CatSper1 fusion protein from mouse testis were selected for use in fusion protein purification (Fig. 3A). In addition, the numerous amino-terminal histidine residues served as native metal binding sites. Indeed, CatSper1 bound well to a cobalt column under relatively stringent conditions (pH 6.5 wash with 1% Triton X-100, 40 mm imidazole). With these two “handles” on CatSper1, a simple strategy could be designed to purify the channel protein complex (Fig. 3B). The HA·eGFP-tagged CatSper1 protein solubilized from the transgenic testes was enriched on a cobalt column, followed by purification on an anti-HA antibody column. The protein eluted with the HA peptide was separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins from CatSper1-/- (for small scale pilot purification) or WT (untagged CatSper1; for large scale purification) testes were used as negative controls. The purification procedure was highly efficient (silver stain detection with <5 mg of membrane protein starting material from 1-3 mice). Identification of the CatSper1 Protein Complex—Three specific bands were identified (Fig. 3C). The bands from a purification using ∼100 mg of protein (60 testes) were stained with Coomassie Blue, excised, trypsin-digested, and identified using mass spectrometry. Peptides from one band were identified as CatSper1 and GFP proteins. The second band was identified as testis-specific HSP70 (HSP70-2) (25Eddy E.M. J. Exp. Zool. 1998; 282: 261-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From the 12 peptides in the third band, a novel protein (CatSperβ) was identified. These three proteins (GFP-CatSper1, HSP70-2, and CatSperβ) were identified in two independent purifications. Using an HSP70-2-specific antibody for Western blot (25Eddy E.M. J. Exp. Zool. 1998; 282: 261-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we confirmed that HSP70-2 could be precipitated with anti-HA antibody from the transgenic mouse testis, presumably by the interaction between HSP70-2 and HA·eGFP·CatSper1, but not with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (negative control; not shown). CatSperβ, a Novel Transmembrane Protein in the CatSper1 Complex—CatSperβ was identified from data base searches and reverse transcription PCR. The full-length mouse CatSperβ (GenBank™ accession number EF199807) encodes an 1109-amino acid protein (126 kDa; calculated pI of 8.6; Fig. 4A). CatSperβ contains two clear transmembrane domains (6-22 of the NH2 terminus, and 1060-1076 at the end of the COOH domain; Fig. 4B). A large extracellular domain (∼1000 amino acids) precedes the carboxyl terminal transmembrane segment. The predicted mouse intracellular carboxyl terminus is only 27 amino acids in length. Eight N-glycosylation sites are predicted in the polypeptide. The overall 2-TM topology is reminiscent of that of the large conductance K+ channel (BK) β subunits and the P2X receptor (ATP-gated channel) (26Knaus H.G. Folander K. Garcia-Calvo M. Garcia M.L. Kaczorowski G.J. Smith M. Swanson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17274-17278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Vial C. Roberts J.A. Evans R.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 487-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but CatSperβ (∼126 kDa) is significantly larger (BK β subunits <30 kDa) (28Brenner R. Jegla T.J. Wickenden A. Liu Y. Aldrich R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6453-6461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Data base searches indicate that CatSperβ is not predicted to be similar to any other protein of established function, although a putative extracellular fragment (Val-166-Gly-294) is weakly similar (42% similarity, 24% identity) to the extracellular loop of a P2X receptor (P2X3b, GenBank™ accession number NP_945337). Human CatSperβ (GenBank™ accession number AK126034) is located on chromosome 14. Mouse (C57BL/6) has two copies of CatSperβ, separated by ∼37 kb on chromosome 12. For reasons not fully understood, fertilization-specific proteins seem to be less conserved between species (29Swanson W.J. Vacquier V.D. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Like CatSper1, CatSperβ is relatively poorly conserved between human and mouse (amino acid identity ∼56%; Fig. 4A). A CatSperβ homolog in the marine chordate C. intestinalis is predicted to encode a 977-amino acid protein. The sequence identity between the mouse and C. intestinalis CatSperβ homologs is 21%, with highest homology in the region close to the carboxyl terminus (not shown). Restricted Expression of CatSperβ mRNA in Testis—Among the eight adult tissues/organs and embryos of four developmental stages examined, only testis had detectable expression of CatSperβ mRNA (Fig. 5A). In situ mRNA antisense revealed robust, specific staining of CatSperβ in the seminiferous tubules; no significant signal was detected in the interstitial cells (Fig. 5B). Within the tubules, CatSperβ appears to be expressed in spermatocytes and spermatids, but not in spermatogonia (Fig. 5B), similar to CatSpers 1-4. Disruption of CatSperβ Protein in CatSper1-/- Sperm—We developed a polyclonal antibody against amino acids 648-984 of CatSperβ protein. Taking advantage of the restricted expression of CatSperβ, nonspecific activity of the antibody was reduced by preabsorption of the antibody sera by total protein from mouse brain and kidney. The purified antibody specifically recognized a protein band from CatSperβ-transfected HEK293 cells, but not from mock-transfected cells (Fig. 6A). The anti-CatSperβ antibody also recognized a band of ∼130 kDa from cobalt-purified testis proteins, presumably by association between CatSperβ and the histidine-rich CatSper1 (not shown). Anti-GFP antibody (but not anti-FLAG M2) immunoprecipitated CatSperβ from HA·eGFP·CatSper transgenic testicular protein, further confirming the association of the two proteins (Fig. 6B). In mouse sperm, the CatSperβ antibody recognized a single major band migrating at the same position as recombinant CatSperβ protein from HEK293 cells (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, CatSperβ was undetectable in the CatSper1 mutant sperm, but was present in CatSper1 mutant testes. In HA·eGFP·CatSper1 transgenic mice, CatSperβ protein was again detected in the mutant sperm (Fig. 6C). Like CatSper1, CatSperβ protein was localized to the sperm principal piece and was largely absent in the CatSper1-/- sperm (Fig. 6D). These data suggest that CatSperβ protein is colocalized with, and dependent upon, CatSper1 protein. Because CatSper2, 3, and 4 antibodies are not as specific for their targets by immunohistochemistry, CatSperβ dependence on these proteins will be examined in more detail using CatSper 2, 3, and 4-/- mice. We used a tagged CatSper1 transgenic mouse to enable unambiguous purification of CatSper1-associating proteins from testes. Previous work has suggested that CatSpers1-4 form a heterotetrameric complex surrounding the Ca2+-selective pore (12Qi H. Moran M.M. Navarro B. Chong J.A. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Kirichok Y. Ramsey I.S. Quill T.A. Clapham D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that a novel auxiliary subunit, CatSperβ, accompanies CatSper proteins. We suggest that CatSperβ is a subunit of the CatSper complex based on its in vitro co-purification, in vivo colocalization, disappearance in CatSper1-/- sperm, and reappearance in sperm from mice rescued with tagged CatSper1. Interestingly both CatSpers and CatSperβ are lacking in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila but both appear in the ascidian C. intestinalis, suggesting that the origin of this molecular complex structure can be traced back to before the divergence among deuterosomes. The CatSper channel complex is reminiscent of the maxi-K Ca2+-activated K+ channel, which consists of a pore-forming α subunit (7-TM) and a 2-TM β subunit. Many other channel complexes have transmembrane auxiliary subunits. In CaV channels, the single TM α2/δ subunit not only increases channel protein surface expression but also affects current kinetics (30Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The 1-TM β subunit of NaV channels has a short intracellular tail but large extracellular domains that also mediate cell-cell interaction (31Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar, 32Isom L.L. Ragsdale D.S. De Jongh K.S. Westenbroek R.E. Reber B.F. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The CatSperβ protein is predicted to have a large extracellular fragment (∼1000 amino acids) with several putative N-glycosylation sites, and we speculate that these extracellular domains could be “sensors” for sperm interactions with other cell types or surfaces. Not surprisingly, heat shock proteins have been implicated in channel assembly, including the HERG K+ channel (33Ficker E. Dennis A.T. Wang L. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: e87-e100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the ClC-2 Cl- channel (34Hinzpeter A. Lipecka J. Brouillard F. Baudoin-Legros M. Dadlez M. Edelman A. Fritsch J. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: C45-C56Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the CFTR Cl- channel (35Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Here, we find that the testis-specific HSP70-2 purifies with CatSper1, suggesting that sperm-specific membrane proteins such as channels require unique chaperones for their correct folding/assembly or trafficking. Unfortunately, preliminary experiments in which HSP70-2, CatSperβ, and all four CatSper subunits were expressed in Xenopus oocytes did not yield functional currents. Similarly, we did not observe changes in the subcellular localization of CatSper1 protein when co-expressed with CatSperβ in cultured HEK293 cells. Functional expression of sperm-specific proteins commonly fails in heterologous systems, as it does in proteins specific to other ciliated structures (e.g. olfactory receptors) (36Reed R.R. Cell. 2004; 116: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We can only speculate as to why this might be so; functional heterologous CatSper channel formation may require 1) additional unknown protein subunits, 2) an intact intraflagellar transport system (37Kierszenbaum A.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 63: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), 3) the unique lipid composition of sperm plasma membrane (38Wolf D.E. Maynard V.M. McKinnon C.A. Melchior D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6893-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), 4) sperm-specific cytosolic composition (39Ikawa M. Wada I. Kominami K. Watanabe D. Toshimori K. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Nature. 1997; 387: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), or 5) all the above.

https://openalex.org/W2082606687,"The evolutionary role of postcopulatory sexual selection in shaping male reproductive traits, including sperm morphology, is well documented in several taxa. However, previous studies have focused almost exclusively on the influence of sperm competition on variation among species. In this study we tested the hypothesis that intraspecific variation in sperm morphology is driven by the level of postcopulatory sexual selection in passerine birds.Using two proxy measures of sperm competition level, (i) relative testes size and (ii) extrapair paternity level, we found strong evidence that intermale variation in sperm morphology is negatively associated with the degree of postcopulatory sexual selection, independently of phylogeny.Our results show that the role of postcopulatory sexual selection in the evolution of sperm morphology extends to an intraspecific level, reducing the variation towards what might be a species-specific 'optimum' sperm phenotype. This finding suggests that while postcopulatory selection is generally directional (e.g., favouring longer sperm) across avian species, it also acts as a stabilising evolutionary force within species under intense selection, resulting in reduced variation in sperm morphology traits. We discuss some potential evolutionary mechanisms for this pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2082562729,"Background The citation rate for articles is viewed as a measure of their importance and impact; however, little is known about what features of articles are associated with higher citation rate. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted a cohort study of all original articles, regardless of study methodology, published in the Lancet, JAMA, and New England Journal of Medicine, from October 1, 1999 to March 31, 2000. We identified 328 articles. Two blinded, independent reviewers extracted, in duplicate, nine variables from each article, which were analyzed in both univariable and multivariable linear least-squares regression models for their association with the annual rate of citations received by the article since publication. A two-way interaction between industry funding and an industry-favoring result was tested and found to be significant (p = 0.02). In our adjusted analysis, the presence of industry funding and an industry-favoring result was associated with an increase in annual citation rate of 25.7 (95% confidence interval, 8.5 to 42.8) compared to the absence of both industry funding and industry-favoring results. Higher annual rates of citation were also associated with articles dealing with cardiovascular medicine (13.3 more; 95% confidence interval, 3.9 to 22.3) and oncology (12.6 more; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 24.0), articles with group authorship (11.1 more; 95% confidence interval, 2.7 to 19.5), larger sample size and journal of publication. Conclusions/Significance Large trials, with group authorship, industry-funded, with industry-favoring results, in oncology or cardiology were associated with greater subsequent citations."

Many human malignant tumors exhibit mitotic defects such as centrosome aberration, abnormal spindle formation, chromosome missegregation, and defective cytokinesis. Chromosome instability phenotypes, or aneuploidies, are the major causative factors of spontaneous abortion, perinatal defects, and malignant tumor progression. Therefore, mitosis is stringently controlled by various regulators and the checkpoint machinery (1Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

S. cerevisiae Dbf2 localizes to the spindle pole body (SPB; centrosome in yeast) in anaphase and the bud neck (contractile ring in yeast) in cytokinesis, functioning as an integral component of the mitotic exit network (MEN) that supervises inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and cytokinesis; Dbf20 is also likely a component of the MEN (24Toyn J.H.

More recently, Lats1 has been reported to interact with its activator, Mob1A, and function as a putative component of the MEN in mammalian cells (38Bothos J. Tuttle R.L. Ottey M. Luca F.C. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6568-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These activities suggest similarities to interactions reported for Lats1 in S. cerevisiae Dbf2, S. pombe Sid2 and Drosophila Lats, which interact with S. cerevisiae Mob1, S. pombe Mob1 and Drosophila Mats, respectively (38Bothos J.

Lats1-deficient mice develop pituitary hyperplasia, soft-tissue sarcomas, and ovarian stromal cell tumors (40St. John M.A. Tao W. Fei X. Fukumoto R. Carcangiu M.L. Brownstein D.G. Parlow A.F. McGrath J. Xu T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Human Lats1 is phosphorylated during mitosis and associates with Cdc2 and the actin filament assembly factor Zyxin, co-localizing to the centrosomes and mitotic spindle. Overexpression of Lats1 leads to G2/M arrest as Lats1 acts as a negative regulator of Cdc2 kinase by associating with Cdc2 (21Tao W. Zhang S. Turenchalk G.S. Stewart R.A. St. John M.A. Chen W. Xu T.

Additionally, overexpression of Lats1 results in up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase-3, or activation of Omi protease, whereas Lats1 is proteolysed by Omi (43Yang X. Li D.M.

Hao Y. Li D.M. Stewart R. Insogna K.L. Xu T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We identified the other mammalian Lats kinase, Lats2 (22Yabuta N. Fujii T. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Nishiguchi H. Endo Y. Toji S. Tanaka H. Nishimune Y. Nojima H. Genomics. 2000; 63: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which is also phosphorylated during mitosis (48Hori T. Takaori-Kondo A. Kamikubo Y. Uchiyama T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3101-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 49Toji S. Yabuta N. Hosomi T. Nishihara S. Kobayashi T. Suzuki S. Tamai K. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Human Lats2 and Lats1 share 85% sequence identity in the kinase domain at the C terminus and 52% overall sequence (22Yabuta N. Fujii T. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Nishiguchi H. Endo Y. Toji S. Tanaka H. Nishimune Y. Nojima H. Genomics. 2000; 63: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similar to Lats1 and Drosophila Lats, Lats2 also appears to coordinate cell proliferation and cell death: overexpression of Lats2/Kpm results in G2/M arrest via inhibition of Cdc2 kinase activity, inhibition of G1/S transition via down-regulation of cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity, and induction of apoptosis via down-regulation of apoptotic inhibitors such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (50Kamikubo Y.

Cell Res. 2004; 298: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, Lats2 is a centrosomal protein that is phosphorylated by the centrosomal kinase Aurora-A; this phosphorylation is important for the centrosomal localization of Lats2 (49Toji S. Yabuta N. Hosomi T. Nishihara S. Kobayashi T. Suzuki S. Tamai K. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Lats2 binds Mdm2, inhibits its E3 ligase activity and activates p53, while p53 rapidly and selectively up-regulates Lats2 expression in G2/M cells, thereby defining a positive feedback loop which constitutes a novel checkpoint pathway critical for the maintenance of proper chromosome number (53Aylon Y. Michael D. Shmuel A. Yabuta N. Nojima H. Oren M. Gene Dev. 2006; 20: 2687-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). On the other hand, two miRNAs, miRNA-372 and-373, function as potential novel oncogenes in testicular germ cell tumors by inhibition of LATS2 expression, which suggests that Lats2 is an important tumor suppressor (54Voorhoeve P.M. le Sage C. Schrier M. Gillis A.J. Stoop H. Nagel R. Liu Y.P. van Duijse J. Drost J. Griekspoor A. Zlotorynski E. Yabuta N. De Vita G. Nojima H. Looijenga L.H. Agami R. Cell. 2006; 124: 1169-1181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). However, the mitotic functions of Lats2, including its role in the centrosome, remain unclear. Recently, knock-out mice in which the LATS2 gene was partially disrupted, leaving its N-terminal amino acid sequence (amino acids 1-370) intact, showed embryonic lethality attributed to defects in cardiac growth (55McPherson J.P. Tamblyn L. Elia A. Migon E. Shehabeldin A. Matysiak-Zablocki E. Lemmers B. Salmena L. Hakem A. Fish J. Kassam F. Squire J. Bruneau B.G. Hande M.P. Hakem R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3677-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from this knock-out mouse exhibited defects in growth control and centrosome duplication. However, Lats2 kinase activity and two Lats Conserved Domains (LCD1 and LCD2; highly conserved sequences in the N-terminal region between Lats1 and Lats2), are required for Lats2 to suppress tumorigenicity and inhibit cell proliferation (51Li Y. Pei J. Xia H. Ke H. Wang H. Tao W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4398-4405Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We have reported that the N terminus of Lats2 (amino acids 1-393) interacts with Aurora-A kinase and that phosphorylation of Ser83 in LCD1 by Aurora-A plays a role in its centrosomal targeting (49Toji S. Yabuta N. Hosomi T. Nishihara S. Kobayashi T. Suzuki S. Tamai K. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, the short N-terminal peptide, expressed in the partially LATS2-deficient mice, may be performing biological functions that mask the true physiological role of Lats2. Thus, we have generated complete LATS2-deficient mice, which do not express any short peptides derived from the LATS2 locus. Here, we demonstrate that completely LATS2-deficient mice show similar but distinct phenotypes from partially LATS2-deficient mice. Lats2 Is Essential for Embryonic Development—To elucidate the biological function of Lats2, we disrupted the entire coding region of mouse LATS2 using a gene-targeting vector. We replaced the first coding exon (E1) with the neomycin selection cassette PGK-neo, flanked by 1.6 and 6.0 kb of sequence homologous to LATS2, resulting in deletion of the translational start site. The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene was used as a negative selection cassette (Fig. 1A). After electroporation of the linearized targeting vector into D3 ES cells, the resultant clones were analyzed with Southern blots using probes A and B. One of 92 ES clones was identified as having the correct targeting (Fig. 1B, clone no. 22), and was injected into blastocysts which were transferred to pseudopregnant females to generate chimeras. This process yielded 7 chimeric mice that produced offspring with germline transmission of the disrupted Lats2 gene. Germline transmission of the targeted Lats2 gene in heterozygous mice was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1C). Lats2 heterozygous (Lats2+/-) mice were born healthy and fertile. However, we found no homozygous (Lats2-/-) mice among the 453 live-born offspring from intercrossing heterozygous mice. The ratio of wild-type (Lats2+/+), Lats2+/-, and Lats2-/- genotypes was 178:275:0 (Table S1). This suggests that Lats2 deficiency results in embryonic lethality. Unexpectedly, the ratio between Lats2+/+ and Lats2+/- genotypes was ∼2:3, indicating a non-Mendelian distribution, and suggests that Lats2 heterozygosity may also cause embryonic lethality. Interestingly, the ratio between Lats2+/+ and Lats2+/- genotypes was ∼1:1.5 in males, whereas the ratio was ∼1:1.8 in females, indicating that Lats2+/- males tend to cause embryonic lethality rather than Lats2+/- females (supplemental Table S1). To examine the timing of developmental arrest in Lats2-/- offspring, the genotypes of embryos generated from Lats2+/- intercross matings were examined by PCR using the primers, KO.con5, E1-AS6, and KS.conB. The 1.9-kb band was amplified by the primers KO.con5 and E1-AS6, indicating the wild-type locus; the 1.6-kb band was amplified by the primers KO.con5 and KS.conB, indicating the Lats2-targeted allele (Fig. 1A). We obtained 53 Lats2-/- embryos (e.g. nos. 7-2, 9-10, and 10-3; Fig. 1D). Using total extracts from Lats2-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), absence of the full-length mRNA and Lats2 protein was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 6, B and A, respectively). These results confirmed that our targeting strategy produced a null allele. Notably, levels of Lats2 protein were indistinguishable between Lats2+/- and Lats2+/+ MEFs. It is possible that Lats2+/- MEFs increased Lats2 protein levels by an as-yet unidentified feedback pathway. In kidney extracts, the levels of Lats2 were also indistinguishable between Lats2+/- and Lats2+/+ mice. 3N. Yabuta and H. Nojima, unpublished results. We monitored life span and tumor formation in Lats2+/- and Lats2+/+ mice exposed to γ-irradiation (dosages of 6 or 8 Gy) over a period of 469 or 40 days, respectively. There were no differences in survival rates (supplemental Fig. S1), distinguishable phenotypes or spontaneous tumor development between Lats2+/- and Lats2+/+ mice. 3N. Yabuta and H. Nojima, unpublished results. We analyzed the morphology of embryos at various stages and found 30 and 3 viable Lats2-/- embryos at embryonic days 10.5 (E10.5) and E11.5, respectively (supplemental Table S2). However, we found no viable Lats2-/- embryos at E12.5 or beyond, and all the Lats2-/- embryos were smaller than their Lats2+/+ and Lats2+/- counterparts (supplemental Fig. S2). Moreover, abnormal dead Lats2-/- embryos were also observed at E10.5, E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, E15.5, and E16.5 and these exhibited severely retarded growth (supplemental Table S2 and Fig. S2). At E16, one Lats2-/- embryo presented an abnormal gross morphology whereby it remained enveloped in amnion or deciduas. 3N. Yabuta and H. Nojima, unpublished results. These results suggest that the lethality of Lats2-null embryos may occur before E12.5 because Lats2 is essential for embryonic development. Although Lats2 deficiency leads to embryonic lethality, the cause of death before E12.5 remains unclear. Therefore, to clarify the role of Lats2 in embryonic development and cell growth, we performed histological analyses of Lats2-/- embryos at various stages of development. At E13.5, histological examination revealed developmental retardation of multiple organs (Fig. 2, A and B). Notably, although the heart was small, the degree of developmental retardation was modest and muscular trabeculation was well-developed in the ventricle (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, the development of the nervous system was severely impaired. In the neuroepithelial layer of the fourth ventricle, a dramatic reduction in the number of nerve cells was observed, as well as infiltration by many inflammatory cells (Fig. 2, E and F). In the spinal cord, both the number of nerve cells and density of nerve fibers were greatly reduced (Fig. 2, G and H). Similar effects were observed as early as E10.5 (Fig. 2, I-N), and although these embryos appeared to be alive, developmental retardation was evident in a number of organs, including the branchial arches and skeletal muscle. Notably, development of the heart was relatively normal: the ventricle had a well-developed muscular trabeculation and the atrium had a wide cavity (Fig. 2, I-L). In contrast, the nervous system exhibited some abnormalities: the neuroepithelial layer of the fourth ventricle was thinner and contained many pyknotic nuclei (Fig. 2, M and N). These results suggest that in the nervous system, a deficiency in Lats2 results in growth arrest or cell death. To confirm whether the cell death observed in Lats2-/- embryos could be attributed to apoptosis, we performed a TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay with sections from Lats2-/- embryos at E13.5. TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were observed in the spinal cord (Fig. 2, O and P) but not the heart, although they were visible in its general proximity (supplemental Fig. S3). Taken together, these results suggest that Lats2 deficiency results in apoptosis primarily in the nervous system. These phenotypes are not necessarily similar to those of partial LATS2-knock-out mice (55McPherson J.P. Tamblyn L. Elia A. Migon E. Shehabeldin A. Matysiak-Zablocki E. Lemmers B. Salmena L. Hakem A. Fish J. Kassam F. Squire J. Bruneau B.G. Hande M.P. Hakem R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3677-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Loss of Lats2 Leads to Centrosome Fragmentation—We have reported previously that Lats2 is a centrosomal protein, phosphorylated by Aurora-A kinase (49Toji S. Yabuta N. Hosomi T. Nishihara S. Kobayashi T. Suzuki S. Tamai K. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To elucidate the function of Lats2 in centrosome regulation, we examined and quantified the status of the centrosome in early-passaged (PDL7) Lats2-/- MEFs during interphase, followed by indirect immunofluorescence analysis using anti-γ-tubulin and anti-α-tubulin antibodies for visualization of centrosomes and microtubules, respectively. Increased number of centrosome was induced in Lats2-deficient MEFs, which contained >2 centrosomes per cell (Fig. 3A, top panels). In contrast, wild-type MEFs contained a normal number of centrosomes (Fig. 3B, bottom panels). We evaluated centrosome numbers in Lats2-/- and wild-type MEFs (Fig. 3B). In primary cultures (early passage), cells with multiple numbers of centrosomes (i.e. >2 per cell) were observed frequently in Lats2-deficient MEFs (24.0%), but rarely in wild-type derived from litters (7.6%). In immortalized Lats2-/- MEFs, the multiple numbers of centrosomes also increased ∼2.9-fold compared with wild-type (Fig. 3B). Next, to examine whether the increased number of centrosome is associated with amplification of centriole, Lats2-deficient MEFs were stained with immunofluorescent antibodies against centrin, a component of centriolar structure (56Beisson J. Wright M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and γ-tubulin, then counterstained with Hoechst to visualize the DNA. As shown in Fig. 3C, the pattern of multiple centrosomes by loss of Lats2 was classified into three subtypes: type I, multiple γ-tubulin spots (>2) were not associated with all amplified centrin spots in a cell that have one nucleus (second panel from top, white arrows); type II, multiple γ-tubulin spots (>2) were associated with all amplified centrin spots in a cell that have one nucleus (third panel from top, insets); type III, multiple γ-tubulin spots (>= 2) were associated with all amplified centrin spots in a cell that have two or more nuclei (bottom panel, insets). When we counted the number of cells in each subtype of Lats2-/- cells, we found that the majority (78.3%) of type I cells was mononuclear (Fig. 3, C-I and D-I). The percentage of type I cells was ∼22.4% of total Lats2-/- cells (supplemental Table S3). Moreover, we investigated the structure of centrioles in thin sections from Lats2+/+ and Lats2-/- embryos using electron microscopy, but we could observe no structural abnormalities in centrioles of Lats2-/- embryo (data not shown). These results suggest that loss of Lats2 causes centrosome fragmentation (fragmentation of the pericentriolar material) because this multiple centrosomes are not associated with amplification of centriole. Indeed, we also observed a cluster of multiple γ-tubulin spots on a mitotic spindle pole in mitotic Lats2-/- cells (63.0%, Fig. 3E, white arrows in an inset). Furthermore, to address whether these extra γ-tubulin foci possess microtubule nucleating activity, we performed the standard in vivo microtubule regrowth assay. Lats2+/+ and Lats2-/- MEFs were treated with cold medium containing nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules, followed by replacement of fresh warm medium without nocodazole to allow regrowth of microtubules. Cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-γ-tubulin and anti-α-tubulin antibodies. Two mature centrosomes of Lats2+/+ and Lats2-/- MEFs successfully formed two significant asters (supplemental Fig. S4, C and F, yellow arrows). However, the extra γ-tubulin foci could not form any asters in Lats2-/- MEFs (Fig. S4F, white arrows). In the case of Lats2-/- MEFs with four mature centrosomes, these mature centrosomes could form four perfect asters (supplemental Fig. S4G). These results suggest that the extra γ-tubulin foci in Lats2-/- MEFs do not possess the microtubule nucleating activity. On the other hand, the majority (98.5%) of type III cells was multinucleated, namely, most of the multiple centrosomes were associated with amplificatio"
https://openalex.org/W2079622198,"During cell division, chromosome segregation must be coordinated with cell cleavage so that cytokinesis occurs after chromosomes have been safely distributed to each spindle pole. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an essential kinase that regulates spindle assembly, mitotic entry and chromosome segregation, but because of its many mitotic roles it has been difficult to specifically study its post-anaphase functions. Here we use small molecule inhibitors to block Plk1 activity at anaphase onset, and demonstrate that Plk1 controls both spindle elongation and cytokinesis. Plk1 inhibition did not affect anaphase A chromosome to pole movement, but blocked anaphase B spindle elongation. Plk1-inhibited cells failed to assemble a contractile ring and contract the cleavage furrow due to a defect in Rho and Rho-GEF localization to the division site. Our results demonstrate that Plk1 coordinates chromosome segregation with cytokinesis through its dual control of anaphase B and contractile ring assembly."

Intracellularly, Ca2+-binding trigger proteins, such as calmodulin with its conserved EF-hand Ca2+-binding sites, have Ca2+-binding affinities in the submicromolar range (9Kawasaki H. Nakayama S. Kretsinger R.H. Biometals. 1998; 11: 277-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). They respond to changes in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and regulate numerous cellular events and processes (10Ermak G. Morgan T.E. Davies K.J. J. Biol.

Extracellularly, Ca2+ also functions as a first messenger to direct numerous intracellular functions (12Breitwieser G.E. Miedlich S.U. Zhang M. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Handford P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Maki M. Kitaura Y.

The Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR) 4The abbreviations used are: CaSR, Ca2+-sensing receptor; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor; ECD, extracellular domain; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; FRET, fluorescence energy transfer; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; CaM, calmodulin. that was initially cloned from the parathyroid gland (15Brown E.M.

Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar) is a sensor of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o) that transforms the [Ca2+]o stimulus into a variety of intracellular responses to regulate multiple signaling pathways (including activation of phospholipases C, A2, and D) and inhibition of cAMP formation (16Brown E.M. MacLeod R.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 239-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar, 17Bai M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 115-125PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor, along with the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptors, and receptors for pheromones, amino acids, and sweeteners, belongs to family C of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Most members in this family have the capacity to sense [Ca2+]o (18Jingami H. Nakanishi S. Morikawa K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Zonta M. Sebelin A. Gobbo S. Fellin T. Pozzan T. Carmignoto G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 553: 407-414Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). More than 100 mutations and polymorphisms have been identified in the CaSR that either inactivate (have a reduced sensitivity to [Ca2+]o) or activate (have an enhanced sensitivity to [Ca2+]o) the receptor and that cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism (in the former) and autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism (in the latter case) (20Hu J.

(Oxf.). 2003; 59: 419-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The CaSR and other members of family C of the G protein-coupled receptor consist of a large extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain with seven transmembrane segments, and an intracellular C-tail segment (22Bai M. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Quinn S.J. Bai M. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37241-37249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Based on the functional responses at the cellular level, the ECD regions have been proposed to contain the major Ca2+-binding sites and to respond to [Ca2+]o for both the mGluRs and CaSRs. The Hill coefficient suggests that 3-5 Ca2+ ions bind cooperatively to the CaSR (22Bai M. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Zhang Z. Sun S. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5316-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition to Ca2+, the CaSR also responds to Mg2+ (25Vetter T. Lohse M.J. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2002; 11: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), polyamines, and amino acids, such as l-Phe. Similar to the capacities of the mGluRs to respond to both l-Glu and high [Ca2+]o, the Ca2+-induced activation of the CaSR is potentiated by l-amino acids, particularly aromatic amino acids (26Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Progress in understanding the mechanism mediating [Ca2+]o regulation is largely hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding the Ca2+-binding sites in the CaSR. To date, the identity of the Ca2+-binding sites in the CaSR and related G protein-coupled receptors still remains unknown. X-ray structural determination by Kunishima et al. (27Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar) reveals that the ECD of mGluR1 contains a Venus flytrap module. Key residues involved in glutamate binding were located at the interface between the two lobes (LB1 and LB2). However, no bound Ca2+ has been observed in these structures with or without the ligand glutamate (28Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2660-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Major challenges in probing Ca2+-binding sites in this class of receptors include the difficulties in crystallization, the rapid off rates because of the low affinity of the Ca2+ binding and the existence of multiple conformations that are in equilibrium with one another (29Yang W. Wilkins A.L. Li S. Ye Y. Yang J.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8267-8273Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Indeed, successful crystallization of the CaSR ECD has not been reported despite a decade or more of effort directed to this end. Furthermore, methods for direct measurement of Ca2+ binding to the CaSR have not yet been established (30Nagar B. Overduin M. Ikura M. Rini J.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 31Hu J. Spiegel A.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 14: 282-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), possibly because of its large size, multiple binding sites, and conformational flexibility. In this study, to reveal the potential Ca2+-sensing locations in the CaSR, we first created model structures of the CaSR based on its structural homology to mGluR1. We then predicted several possible Ca2+-binding sites using our established computational algorithms based on the common structural properties of Ca2+-binding sites in proteins. We have shown that removing the predicted ligand residues in the full-length CaSR results in significant changes in the intracellular responses to [Ca2+]o. Two predicted continuous Ca2+-binding sites (e.g. sites with ligand-binding sites within short continuous primary sequences (<30 residues)) were further validated by inserting the sequences individually into a non-Ca2+-binding host protein, CD2. The resulting engineered proteins (designated CD2-CaSR1 and CD2-CaSR2) possess the ability to bind Ca2+ and Ln3+, in which the predicted Ca2+-binding residues were shown to be involved in Ca2+/Ln3+ binding by high resolution NMR and site-directed mutagenesis, further validating our prediction of Ca2+-binding sites within the ECD of the CaSR. Computational Prediction of Ca2+-binding Sites from a Model Structure—A sequence alignment of the ECD region (1-540 residues) of the human CaSR and mouse mGluR was carried out using the ClustalW program (32Higgins D.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar). Structural modeling of the CaSR was performed using SWISS-MODEL (33Kopp J. Schwede T. Pharmacogenomics. 2004; 5: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar) and MODELLER software (35Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar) based on the structures of mGluR1 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) codes 1EWT (27Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar) and 1ISR (28Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2660-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar)). Thereafter, the putative Ca2+-binding sites in the CaSR were predicted using the program MetalFinder as described previously (36Yang W. Wilkins A.L. Ye Y. Liu Z.R. Li S.Y. Urbauer J.L. Hellinga H.W. Kearney A. van der Merwe P.A. Yang J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2085-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Asp was used as the anchor ligand, because it is the most frequently used amino acid residue in Ca2+-binding sites. The oxygen atoms from backbone carbonyls and the side chains of Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr, and Tyr were used as potential Ca2+ ligand residues. In the computational calculation, an increased Ca-O distance (1.0-4.0 Å) and O-Ca-O angles (±60°) were used to compensate for the uncertainties in the model structures (37Hellinga H.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 763-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 38Yang W. Jones L.M. Isley L. Ye Y. Lee H.W. Wilkins A. Liu Z.R. Hellinga H.W. Malchow R. Ghazi M. Yang J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6165-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Deng H. Chen G. Yang W. Yang J.J. Proteins. 2006; 64: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The resulting potential sites identified by the algorithm were scored and ranked based on the ligands. Those that used all native, existing residues of the CaSR sequence as the ligands received the highest scores. The predicted sites that required mutations to similar residue types received higher scores than others. Similar residue types refer to the following pairs: Asn-Asp, Gln-Glu, Asp-Glu, and Ser-Thr. In contrast, the requirement of mutating non-Ca2+-binding ligands suggests that the location does not bind Ca2+ in the native CaSR. Finally, the electrostatic potentials were calculated using the program DelPhi (40Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar, 41Nicholls A. Honig B. J. Comput. Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Crossref Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), and the model structures with the hydrogen atoms were built in by SYBYL. For the DelPhi calculations, interior and exterior dielectric constants of 2 and 80, respectively, were used. The salt concentration was 0, and the linear solution of the Poisson Boltzmann equation was imposed until convergence was reached. The geometrically predicted locations with 2-4 negatively charged ligands, strong negative surface potential, and functionally necessary residues were more likely to bind Ca2+. The model structures of CD2 variants with grafted potential Ca2+-binding sites of the CaSR were generated by SWISSMODEL (33Kopp J. Schwede T. Pharmacogenomics. 2004; 5: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). Measurement of [Ca2+]i in the Cell Population by Fluorimetry—The [Ca2+]i responses of wild type and mutant CaSRs were assessed as described by Bai et al. (42Bai M. Quinn S. Trivedi S. Kifor O. Pearce S.H. Pollak M.R. Krapcho K. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19537-19545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In brief, the HEK293 cells transfected with the CaSR or its mutant cDNAs were loaded with Fura-2/AM. The remaining extracellular Fura-2/AM was washed out before the cells were transferred to a fluorescence cuvette. The emission at 510 nm was measured with excitation at 340 and 380 nm under varying [Ca2+]o (0.5-20.5 mm). The ratio of the fluorescence intensities was used to derive [Ca2+]i. All measurements were carried out in triplicate. Data are expressed with the S.E. of the mean as the index of dispersion. Protein Engineering, Expression, and Purification—The CaSR sequences Gly222-Ile235 (GIEKFREEAEERDI) and Gly383-Ile408 (GHEESGDRFSNSSTAFRPLCTGDENI) were individually inserted between Ser52 and Gly53 of CD2 in the plasmid pGEX-2T (denoted as CD2-CaSR1 and CD2-CaSR2, respectively) by PCR using an established protocol (63Ye Y. Lee H.W. Yang W. Shealy S.J. Wilkins A.L. Liu Z.R. Torshin I. Harrison R. Wohlhueter R. Yang J.J. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two mutants, CD2-CaSR1-E228A/E229A and CD2-CaSR2-E378A/E379A, were also made by site-directed mutagenesis. Three glycines at the N terminus and two at the C terminus of the inserted sequences were thereafter inserted using a similar procedure (denoted as CD2-CaSR1-5G and CD2-CaSR2-5G). The mutants of the engineered proteins were produced using standard PCR methods. All sequences were verified by automated sequencing on an ABI PRISM-377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) at the Advanced Biotechnology Core Facilities of Georgia State University. The proteins were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein using Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells in LB medium with 100 mg/liter of ampicillin at 37 °C. For 15N isotopic labeling, 15NH4Cl was supplemented as the sole source of nitrogen in the minimal medium. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 100 μm was added when the A600 reached 0.6 to induce protein expression for another 3-4 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min. The purification procedures followed the protocols for glutathione S-transferase fusion protein purification using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). The glutathione S-transferase tag of the proteins was cleaved on the beads by thrombin. The eluted engineered CD2 variants were further purified using Superdex 75 and Hitrap SP columns (GE Healthcare). The purified proteins were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry at the Advanced Biotechnology Core Facilities of Georgia State University. The protein concentrations were determined using an ϵ280 of 11,700 m-1 cm-1 (43Driscoll P.C. Cyster J.G. Somoza C. Crawford D.A. Howe P. Harvey T.S. Kieffer B. Campbell I.D. Williams A.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS)—ESI-MS was performed using a Waters Micromass Q-TOF micromass spectrometer. The data were acquired in positive ion mode by syringe pump infusion of the protein solutions at a flow rate of 7 μl/min. The protein sample stock (∼1 mm) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, was diluted 100-fold into water. Metal ions were added in 5-fold molar excess relative to the protein concentration. Circular Dichroism—The circular dichroism spectra were recorded from 190 to 260 nm on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter at ambient temperature using a quartz cell of 1 mm path length with protein concentrations ranging from 15 to 20 μm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. All spectra were the average of 10 scans with a scan rate of 100 nm/min. The spectra were converted to mean residue molar ellipticity after subtracting the spectrum of the buffer as the blank. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—A PTI lifetime fluorimeter was used to record the fluorescence spectra at ambient temperature using a 1-cm path length cell. Intrinsic tryptophan emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm with the excitation wavelength at 282 nm. The slit widths were set at 4 and 8 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Protein samples (1.5-3.0 μm) were in 20 mm PIPES-10 mm KCl at pH 6.8. For Tyr/Trp-sensitized Tb3+ fluorescence energy transfer (Tb3+-FRET) experiments, emission spectra were collected from 500 to 600 nm with the excitation at 282 nm with slit widths for excitation and emission set at 8 and 12 nm, respectively. A glass filter with cutoff of 320 nm was used to circumvent secondary Rayleigh scattering. The Tb3+ titration was performed by gradually adding different volumes of Tb3+ stock solutions (1 mm) into the protein samples (2.5 μm) in 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, with 10-150 mm KCl. For the Ca2+ competition studies, a solution containing 30 μm Tb3+ and 1.5 μm protein was set as the starting point. The stock solution of 10-100 mm CaCl2 with the same concentration of Tb3+ and protein was gradually added in the initial mixture. The fluorescence intensity was normalized by subtracting the contribution of the base-line slope using logarithmic fitting. The Tb3+-binding affinity of protein was obtained by fitting normalized fluorescence intensity data using the equation, f=([P]T+[M]T+Kd)-([P]T+[M]T+Kd)2-4[P]T[M]T2[P]T(Eq. 1) where f is the fractional change, Kd is the dissociation constant for Tb3+, and [P]T and [M]T are the total concentrations of protein and Tb3+, respectively. The Ca2+ competition data were first analyzed to derive the apparent dissociation constant by Equation 1. By assuming that the sample is saturated with Tb3+ at the starting point of the competition, the Ca2+-binding affinity is further obtained by using the equation, Kd,Ca=Kapp×Kd,TbKd,Tb+[Tb](Eq. 2) where Kd,Ca and Kd,Tb are the dissociation constants of Ca2+ and Tb3+, respectively. Kapp is the apparent dissociation constant. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were collected on a 600-MHz NMR spectrometer. Two-dimensional total correlation spectra were collected using a water-gated total correlation spectroscopy pulse sequence with an isotropic mixing time of 75 ms at 25 °C. The spectrum width was 13.3 parts/million at both dimensions with a complex data point of 4096 at the first dimension and 400 increments at the second dimension. Two-dimensional (15N,1H)-heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectra were collected with 4096 complex data points at the 1H dimension and 128 increments at the 15N dimension. Samples contained the protein at 1 mm in 20 mm PIPES-150 mm KCl, 10% D2O at pH 6.8. All of the NMR data were processed using FELIX (Accelrys) on a Silicon Graphics computer. Prediction of Ca2+-binding Sites in the CaSR—The ECD of the CaSR contains the majority of the Ca2+-sensing determinants, and glycosylation does not play a significant role in the activation of the receptor by high [Ca2+]o. Both mGluRs and CaSR respond to high [Ca2+]o and are potentiated (activated) by l-amino acids (26Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Their ECDs share ∼30% sequence identity and a highly similar arrangement of secondary structural elements to that of mGluR. Therefore, we performed sequence alignment of the ECD region (1-540 residues) of the human CaSR and mouse mGluR, and then model structures of the ECD of the CaSR were created based on three structures of mGluR1, the ligand-free form (PDB code 1EWT), the Glu- and Mg2+-bound forms (PDB code 1EWK) (27Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), and the Glu- and Gd3+-bound form (PDB code 1ISR) (28Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2660-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the model structure of the ECD of the CaSR with the Venus flytrap structure. Two subdomains, termed as lobe 1 (N terminus) and lobe 2 (C terminus), are linked by several loops. The structure is very similar to the model structures previously reported by Bai (22Bai M. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and Silve et al. (44Silve C. Petrel C. Leroy C. Bruel H. Mallet E. Rognan D. Ruat M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37917-37923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This similarity of the models from different groups and methods strengthens the assumption that the model structures accurately represent the true structures of the CaSR. We then predicted potential Ca2+-binding pockets in the modeled CaSR structure using our developed computational algorithms (“Materials and Methods”). Fig. 1 and Table 1 show three predicted potential Ca2+-binding pockets (sites 1-3) in the modeled CaSR after the evaluation of their local geometric properties and electrostatic potentials. site 1 is located in lobe 2. It contains five glutamate residues in a nine-residue sequence (Glu224-Glu232). Three positive residues (Lys225, Arg227, and Arg233) and one aspartate residue (Asp234) are either in or follow this sequence closely. Site 2, located in lobe 1, includes all of the predicted ligand residues in a 22-residue sequence (Glu378-Glu399), which are Glu378, Glu379, Thr396, Asp398, and Glu399. Predicted sites 1 and 2 do not have extensive interactions with other parts of the protein. Site 3 is formed by residues Ser147, Ser170, Asp190, Tyr218, and Glu297, which are located in the crevice between the two lobes. All three sites are located at flexible loops or helical regions and are largely exposed on the surface of the protein. These geometrically predicted sites overlap with the negatively charged “hot spots” predicted by the electrostatic potential (Fig. 1).TABLE 1Predicted Ca2+ binding sites and their corresponding mutations in diseases.

To investigate the role of the proposed Ca2+-binding sites in the biological function of the CaSR, we created several mutations in the predicted charged ligand residues in the full-length CaSR. Specifically, we used site-directed mutagenesis to mutate the following residues: E297I in predicted site 3 located at the crevice, E224I and E228I/E229I in site CaSR1 located in lobe 2, and E378I/E379I and E398I/E399I in site CaSR2 located in lobe 1 (Tables 1 and 2). The wild type CaSR and the respective mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells using previously reported methods (45Zhang Z. Qiu W. Quinn S.J. Conigrave A.D. Brown E.M. Bai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33727-33735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The effects of the mutations on the biological function of the CaSR are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, removal of putatively charged ligand residues at all three predicted Ca2+-binding sites led to significant alterations in either maximal Ca2+ response and/or sensitivity to [Ca2+]o of the CaSR. E224I and the double mutant E228I/E229I at predicted site 1 decreased the maximal Ca2+ response by 35-38% with a slight left shift in sensitivity to [Ca2+]o (EC50 = 2.5 ± 0.3 and 2.8 ± 0.2 mm, respectively, versus 3.1 ± 0.2 mm for the wild type CaSR, n = 3, p < 0.05). The mutation E398I/E399I in the predicted site 2 also resulted in a 37% decrease in the maximal intracellular Ca2+ response. This mutant, however, exhibited a right-shifted EC50 of 4.4 ± 0.2 mm (p < 0.01). Interestingly, the E378I/E379I mutant at the same predicted site resulted in a 23% enhancement in the maximal response and a left-shifted EC50 (EC50 = 2.2 ± 0.1 mm, n = 3, p < 0.01). Mutation E297I in site 3 significantly impaired the sensitivity to the [Ca2+]o response with an EC50 of 9.6 ± 0.2 mm.TABLE 2Summary of the maximal response and EC50 values of CaSR and its mutantsPredicted siteMutationMaximal responseCa2+, EC50%mmSite 1Wild type1003.1 ± 0.2E224I65 ± 1ap < 0.012.5 ± 0.3bp < 0.05E228I/E229I62 ± 6ap < 0.012.8 ± 0.2Site 2E378I/E379I123 ± 6bp < 0.052.2 ± 0.1ap < 0.01E398I/E399I63 ± 12bp < 0.054.4 ± 0.2ap < 0.01Site"
https://openalex.org/W2057826420,"Loss of tropical forests and changes in land-use/land-cover are of growing concern worldwide. Although knowledge exists about the institutional context in which tropical forest loss is embedded, little is known about the role of social institutions in influencing regeneration of tropical forests. In the present study we used Landsat images from southern Madagascar from three different years (1984, 1993 and 2000) and covering 5500 km2, and made a time-series analysis of three distinct large-scale patterns: 1) loss of forest cover, 2) increased forest cover, and 3) stable forest cover. Institutional characteristics underlying these three patterns were analyzed, testing the hypothesis that forest cover change is a function of strength and enforcement of local social institutions. The results showed a minor decrease of 7% total forest cover in the study area during the whole period 1984–2000, but an overall net increase of 4% during the period 1993–2000. The highest loss of forest cover occurred in a low human population density area with long distances to markets, while a stable forest cover occurred in the area with highest population density and good market access. Analyses of institutions revealed that loss of forest cover occurred mainly in areas characterized by insecure property rights, while areas with well-defined property rights showed either regenerating or stable forest cover. The results thus corroborate our hypothesis. The large-scale spontaneous regeneration dominated by native endemic species appears to be a result of a combination of changes in precipitation, migration and decreased human population and livestock grazing pressure, but under conditions of maintained and well-defined property rights. Our study emphasizes the large capacity of a semi-arid system to spontaneously regenerate, triggered by decreased pressures, but where existing social institutions mitigate other drivers of deforestation and alternative land-use."

We here report that knock down of the F-actin-binding protein Abp1, which is important for endocytosis and synaptic organization, results in changes in axon development virtually identical to Arp2/3 complex inhibition, i.e., a selective increase of axon length. Our in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that Abp1 interacts directly with N-WASP, an activator of the Arp2/3 complex, and releases the autoinhibition of N-WASP in cooperation with Cdc42 and thereby promotes N-WASP-triggered Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization. In line with our mechanistical studies and the colocalization of Abp1, N-WASP and Arp2/3 at sites of actin polymerization in neurons, we reveal an essential role of Abp1 and its cooperativity with Cdc42 in N-WASP-induced rearrangements of the neuronal cytoskeleton. We furthermore show that introduction of N-WASP mutants lacking the ability to bind Abp1 or Cdc42, Arp2/3 complex inhibition, Abp1 knock down, N-WASP knock down and Arp3 knock down, all cause identical neuromorphological phenotypes. Our data thus strongly suggest that these proteins and their complex formation are important for cytoskeletal processes underlying neuronal network formation."
https://openalex.org/W2017813215,"The transcription factor Stat6 plays a critical role in interleukin-4-dependent gene activation. To mediate this function, Stat6 recruits canonical transcriptional co-activators including the histone acetyl transferases CREB-binding protein and NCoA-1 and other proteins such as a p100 co-factor. However, much remains unknown regarding the constituents of Stat6 enhancer complexes, and the exact molecular events that modulate Stat6-dependent gene activation are not fully understood. Recently, we identified a novel co-factor, CoaSt6 (collaborator of Stat6), which associates with Stat6 and enhances its transcriptional activity. Sequence homologies place CoaSt6 in a superfamily of poly(ADP-ribosyl)polymerase (PARP)-like proteins. We have demonstrated here that PARP enzymatic activity is associated with CoaSt6, and this function of CoaSt6 can append ADP-ribose to itself and p100. Further, we show that a catalytically inactive mutant of CoaSt6 was unable to enhance Stat6-mediated transcription of a test promoter. Consistent with these findings, chemical inhibition of PARP activity blocked interleukin-4-dependent transcription from target promoters in vivo.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). A major source of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity is encoded by PARP-1 (3Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), which can engage in heterotypic interactions with transcription factors (4Kraus W.L. Lis J.T.

Analyses of PARP-1-deficient cells indicate that this protein constitutes a major portion of the global PARP activity in some cell types (3Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 6Shall S. de Murcia G. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). However, it is clear that PARP-1 selectively interacts with some proteins but not others (2Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar, 3Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), that a substantial fraction of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is maintained in PARP-1 knock-out cells, and that a complete lack of PARP-1 is compatible with normal mouse development (6Shall S. de Murcia G. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Moreover, most cellular functions are maintained in PARP-1-deficient cells (6Shall S. de Murcia G. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), which grow normally in the absence of genotoxic stress (3Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that functions of other PARP enzymatic activities likely compensate for the absence of PARP-1.Analyses of genomic sequences indicate that 15 mammalian proteins contain a segment with significant homology to the PARP catalytic domain of PARP-1 (reviewed in Ref. 2Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). These proteins in a PARP-like superfamily have been divided into subgroups based on analyses of their primary structures in silico. Prior cloning work and enzymatic analyses have indicated that several other members of the PARP superfamily are enzymatically active, but relatively little is known about their function (2Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). Members of one of the least-characterized branches of the PARP superfamily are termed the macro-PARP proteins (2Schreiber V. Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). In these polypeptides, the portion exhibiting homology to the PARP catalytic region is preceded by one or several iterations of a domain homologous to a unique component of an atypical histone, macroH2a (7Pehrson J.R. Fried V.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1398-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Various functions have been ascribed to macrodomains taken from among the set of different proteins containing them, including binding of PAR polymers (8Karras G.I. Kustatscher G. Buhecha H.R. Allen M.D. Pugieux C. Sait F. Bycroft M. Ladurner A.G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1911-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) or phosphoesterase activity (8Karras G.I. Kustatscher G. Buhecha H.R.

Grayhack E.J. Phizicky E.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1153-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The macro-PARP subfamily is of particular interest, because one of its members, termed BAL (B aggressive lymphoma), was highlighted in a differential display analysis of mRNAs in comparisons of diffuse large B cell lymphomas of greater versus less clinical aggressiveness (10Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Salgia R. Fletcher J.A. Shipp M.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been noted that, despite the homology of its PARP-like domain, this enzymatic activity could not be detected in association with BAL1 (11Aguiar R.C. Takeyama K. He C. Kreinbrink K. Shipp M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33756-33765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Another member of the macro-PARP subfamily was identified recently by a search for additional proteins that could serve as co-factors for or modifiers of Stat6-mediated transcriptional regulation in cellular responses to the immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-4 (12Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A cytosolic 2-hybrid screen in yeast seeking Stat6-interacting proteins isolated a cDNA from mouse splenocytes that encodes a macro-PARP (12Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Additional studies validated the interaction between this polypeptide, which was termed CoaSt6 (collaborator of Stat6) and Stat6. Functional analyses provided evidence that CoaSt6 can amplify the function of Stat6 and thereby modulate the induction of target genes by IL-4. However, it is not known whether the PARP sequence homology within CoaSt6 would, similar to BAL, fail to encode a functional ribosyl transferase or whether it instead is a functional PARP. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the PARP domain is important for any of the transcriptional functions of CoaSt6.Using single-point substitutions as well as assay of purified bacterially produced recombinant protein, we have shown here that CoaSt6 is associated with PARP catalytic activity that can ADP-ribosyl)ate itself as well as p100, a co-activator recruited by Stat6. Many transcriptional functions of PARP-1 appear not to require its PARP enzymatic activity. For instance, PARP-1 serves as a co-factor for NF-κB transcription factors in a manner independent from its PARP catalytic activity (13Hassa P.O. Covic M. Hasan S. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45588-45597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The role of PARP-1 instead is to promote multiprotein interactions (14Hassa P.O. Buerki C. Lombardi C. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45145-45153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that a catalytically inactive point mutant of CoaSt6 failed to potentiate the Stat6-dependent activation of a reporter. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of PARP activity blocked IL-4 induction of endogenous genes as well as a Stat6 and CoaSt6 responsive reporter. We conclude that CoaSt6-associated PARP function plays a role in IL-4 induced, Stat6-mediated gene regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Recombinant DNAs—Cell lines 293T (derived from human embryonic kidney), ΦNX (derived from 293), HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), and M12 (mouse B lymphoma) and their culture in standard media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's and RPMI 1640 media) containing 10% fetal bovine serum were as described previously (12Goenka S.

Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mutated cDNAs encoding portions of CoaSt6 (N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and CoaSt6-(1216–1817) were generated by PCR with Pfu polymerase and cloned into the pCMV-Tag2 vector in-frame with the FLAG epitope tag. CoaSt6-(1216–1817) was also cloned in-frame with a His tag in the bacterial expression vector pET28. Point mutations were engineered in the PARP domain of CoaSt6 using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR primers were designed containing the point mutation and were used in PCR reactions with wild type CoaSt6 in pCMV-Tag2 as a template. The methylated template DNA containing wild type CoaSt6 sequences was fragmented using DpnI. After bacterial transformation, clones containing the desired point mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Inserts in pCMV-Tag2 were excised and subcloned into pcDNA3. FLAG epitope-tagged p100 expression constructs were generous gifts of E. Kieff (17Tong X. Drapkin R. Yalamanchili R. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4950-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation, PARP Assays, and Immunoblotting—293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids, and whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (12Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Goenka S. Marlar C. Schindler U. Boothby M. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitations (IPs) were performed using 5 μg of monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) (Sigma-Aldrich) alone or with 1 μg of anti-Stat6 (M-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Alternatively, 293-derived ΦNX cells (19Ouyang W. Ranganath S.H. Weindel K. Bhattacharya D. Murphy T.L. Sha W.C. Murphy K.M. Immunity. 1998; 9: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) were transfected with untagged CoaSt6 in pcDNA3 and epitope-tagged p100 in pSG5. Lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG. In each case, the immune complexes were collected using protein G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rinsed, and divided equally. One portion was eluted and used for Western blotting. The other fraction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in PARP assay buffer (20 μl) containing 5 μCi (0.25 μm) 32P-labeled NAD+ (1000 Ci/mmol) (GE Healthcare), 12.5 μm cold NAD+, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 4 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol (20Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Where indicated, PARP activity was inhibited with 1 mm 3-aminobenzamide (3-ABA) (Sigma-Aldrich). After completion of the reaction, the beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove excess substrate, and the bound proteins were eluted, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. PARP assays were also performed with cold NAD+ only and probed with the monoclonal anti-PAR antibody 10H (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). For detection of PAR-modified CoaSt6 in cell lysates, extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using 10H anti-PAR antibody as above. His-tagged CoaSt6-(1216–1817) was expressed in Escherichia coli, and proteins expressed in inclusion bodies were extracted under denaturing conditions and refolded by sequential dialysis against buffer containing decreasing amounts of urea. Refolded CoaSt6-(1216–1817) was purified using Talon beads (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) and used in PARP assays and Western blotting.Northern Blotting—M12 B cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of 3-ABA and a combination of IL-4 (5 ng/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (5 μg/ml). Northern blots of total RNA isolated from these cultured cells were probed with cDNAs for CD23, Gϵ, and GAPDH, subjected to autoradiography, and quantified using a phosphorimaging device (Fuji FLA-2000).Reporter Assays—Using a constant total DNA for each sample, CMV-β-galactosidase (100 ng), and the indicated expression constructs in pCMV-Tag2 or pcDNA3 (1 μg), along with a CD23b-(N3)3-Luc (21Dent A.L. Shaffer A.L. Yu X. Allman D. Staudt L.M. Science. 1997; 276: 589-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) or Gϵ-(N4)3-Luc (22Litterst C.M. Pfitzner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45713-45721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reporter construct (1 μg) were co-transfected into HepG2 cells using Transfectin reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, the cells were divided equally and either left untreated or treated with 5 ng/ml of IL-4 for an additional 24 h. For assays after inhibition of PARP activity, the cells were divided 24 h after transfection, recultured for 12 h, and then treated with IL-4 along with increasing concentrations of 3-ABA for a final 12 h. Firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed on extracts of the transfected cells as described (12Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).RESULTSPoly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of CoaSt6 in the Presence of NAD+—We recently identified a novel co-factor, CoaSt6, which interacts with Stat6 and amplifies its activity in mediating transcriptional responses to IL-4 (12Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To understand better the mechanism(s) by which CoaSt6 modulates Stat6 function, we focused on a region toward the C terminus that exhibited sequence homology with the catalytic domain of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) (Fig. 1a). Because the prototypical PARP-1 and PARP-2 each can serve as a substrate for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, we first tested whether CoaSt6 underwent a similar modification. Epitope-tagged CoaSt6 was expressed in 293T cells, immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibodies, and incubated with [32P]NAD+ as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties. IPs that contained CoaSt6 showed a radiolabeled signal migrating at the same position as CoaSt6, only in samples transfected with the CoaSt6 cDNA; these data strongly indicate that CoaSt6 underwent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (Fig. 1b). To test whether this post-translational modification of CoaSt6 was a result of a typical PARP catalytic activity, the transfer reaction was carried out in the presence of 3-ABA, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of PARP catalytic activity. Virtually all 32P modification of CoaSt6 was abrogated by 3-ABA, further indicating that a PARP catalytic activity was responsible for the post-translational modification of CoaSt6 (Fig. 1c). To extend these findings, we probed blots of proteins with antibodies against the PAR polymer. In experiments where CoaSt6 PARP reactions with exogenous NAD were carried out in the presence or absence of 3-ABA and then subjected to Western blot analysis, a band co-migrating with CoaSt6 was recognized by the anti-PAR antibody (Fig. 1d) but eliminated when the reaction was carried out with 3-ABA present. Furthermore, we analyzed extracts of cells transfected with CoaSt6 and controls. These experiments showed that a protein strongly reactive with anti-PAR antibodies and co-migrating with CoaSt6 was observed only in CoaSt6-transfected cells (Fig. 1e). To determine whether CoaSt6 endogenous to mouse lymphoid cells similarly confers a PARP function, we immunoprecipitated CoaSt6 from M12 B cells and subjected the IPs to PARP reaction conditions in the absence or presence of 3-ABA. Consistent with the preceding data, endogenously expressed CoaSt6 was able to confer PARP modification (Fig. 1f). Endogenously expressed CoaSt6 also showed evidence of PAR modification as detected by an antibody specific for this post-translational modification (Fig. 1g). These results collectively indicate that CoaSt6 is an in vivo target for ADP-ribosylation.The observed poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of CoaSt6 could arise because the protein participates in a heterotypic interaction with a PARP such as PARP-1, which is known to form various heterodimers. Alternatively, the PARP-like region of CoaSt6 could encode a bona fide poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. To test whether CoaSt6 sequences were enzymatically active independent of other protein interactions, we expressed His-tagged CoaSt6-(1216–1817) in E. coli, purified the protein, and performed PARP assays. Purified CoaSt6-(1216–1817) catalyzed the addition of NAD+ to the protein in vitro (Fig. 1h), a finding most consistent with intrinsic PARP activity residing in the PARP-like domain independent of other heterotypic interactions.Role of PARP Domain Residues in CoaSt6-associated PARP Activity—To determine whether the PARP-like domain contained in CoaSt6 was crucial for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, we tested a variety of mutated cDNAs. Several deletion mutants of CoaSt6 (Fig. 2a) were tested for their ability to self-poly(ADPribosyl)ate in immunoprecipitates incubated with radiolabeled NAD+. Each version of CoaSt6 that contained the PARP-like domain was poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated (Fig. 2b). These included the C-terminal only, a combination of the C and middle portion of CoaSt6, and CoaSt6-(1216–1817), which is the version of CoaSt6 that contains the C-terminal and one hismacro domain (Fig. 2b). In contrast, no labeling by [32P]NAD+ was observed for the CoaSt6 N-terminal portion or the triplicate hismacro domains, which lack the PARP-like region. These results suggest that the PARP-like domain of CoaSt6 is responsible for adding the ADP-ribose moieties. To extend these results, we identified several amino acid residues within the PARP-like domain of CoaSt6 that are conserved among active PARPs, several of which are essential for catalytic activity in PARP-1 (Fig. 2c). When substitution mutants were tested for their ability to undergo poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in immune precipitates (as described above), we observed a dramatic decrease in their capacity to self-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate as compared with their wild type counterpart (Fig. 2d).FIGURE 2The CoaSt6 PARP-like sequence encodes the catalytically active polymerase. a, schematic diagram of expression constructs encoding FLAG-tagged portions of CoaSt6, which were transfected into 293T cells and assayed for [32P]NAD addition to proteins as described for Fig. 1a.

Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To explore the interplay between the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ating activity of CoaSt6 and Stat6, FLAG-tagged CoaSt6 and Stat6 were co-expressed, Stat6 was induced by IL-4, and the resultant cell extracts were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation of Stat6 and CoaSt6. The resultant IPs were then assayed with radiolabeled NAD+. As above, CoaSt6 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated itself in cells with little endogenous Stat6 and untreated with IL-4 (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). Although there were abundant protein levels of Stat6 and CoaSt6 in the IPs, no positive signal for the poly(ADP-ribosyl)-ation of Stat6 by CoaSt6 was observed (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). These results suggest that, although Stat6 associates with CoaSt6, Stat6 is not an efficient substrate for the PARP catalytic activity of CoaSt6. However, the ability of CoaSt6 to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate itself was substantially increased in the presence of Stat6 after induction by IL-4 (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and 8). These observations indicate that the co-association of CoaSt6 with IL-4-activated Stat6 enhances the auto-PARylation activity of CoaSt6.FIGURE 3IL-4 enhances the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ating function of CoaSt6 in the presence of Stat6. 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression plasmids and were left untreated or treated with IL-4 for 1 h. Immunoprecipitated extracts from these cells were divided and either subjected to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reactions with 32P-labeled NAD+ and autoradiographed (upper panel, with quantitation by phosphorimaging indicated in the bar graph beneath) or immunoblotted and probed for Stat6 and FLAG as indicated (lower two panels). The two-lane side panel is a shorter exposure of the same lanes 7 and 8 from the same gel to allow better visualization of the ∼200 kDa CoaSt6 band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Allomodification of an Exogenous Protein Substrate by CoaSt6/PARP-14—We wanted to determine whether CoaSt6 is able to target heterologous proteins for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, or if, instead, it is only efficient at automodification. The preceding data indicate that Stat6, despite its physical interaction with CoaSt6, is not an efficient substrate for CoaSt6-mediated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, but CoaSt6 might modify other proteins that are involved in enhancer complexes with Stat6. When CoaSt6 endogenous to B cells was immunoprecipitated using anti-CoaSt6 and used in PARP assays, a protein migrating at the 100-kDa position was detected in addition to the ∼200-kDa CoaSt6 signal (Fig. 4a). A nuclear protein p100 is a Stat6-associated transcriptional co-factor thought to enhance interactions between Stat6 and RNA polymerase II as part of the basal transcriptional machinery (18Yang J. Aittomaki S. Pesu M. Carter K. Saarinen J. Kalkkinen N. Kieff E. Silvennoinen O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4950-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To test whether this p100 was a target for poly(ADP ribosyl)ation, we immunoprecipitated endogenously expressed p100 and probed the precipitate with an anti-PAR antibody. Consistent with the in vitro PARP reaction, we observed a signal for PAR at the 100-kDa position which co-migrated with the signal observed with anti-p100 (Fig. 4b). Therefore, we evaluated whether CoaSt6 can target p100 for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. First, we tested whether p100 and CoaSt6 associate with one another independently of Stat6. Untagged CoaSt6 and epitope-tagged p100 were co-expressed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG followed by immunoblotting with anti-CoaSt6 antibodies. A CoaSt6-specific signal was observed in anti-FLAG immune complexes only when both the proteins were expressed (Fig. 4c), indicating that CoaSt6 associated with p100. Similar results were obtained when cells were separately transfected with individual expression constructs (CoaSt6; p100) and cell-free extracts were mixed prior to IP (data not shown).FIGURE 4p100 can associate with and be poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by CoaSt6. a, extracts from M12 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either normal rabbit IgG or anti-CoaSt6. The resultant precipitate was used in PARP reactions as in Fig. 1a. b, BJAB cell extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with either a control antibody or one specific for p100. The precipitated proteins were then probed with anti-PAR or anti-p100. c, ΦNX cells were transiently transfected with combinations of expression vectors containing FLAG-tagged p100, CoaSt6, and empty vector controls. Extracts of transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies and analyzed by Western blotting with either anti-peptide antibodies specific for CoaSt6 (12Goenka S. Boothby M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4210-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or anti-FLAG. In parallel, portions of each extract prior to IP were probed with the indicated antibodies. d, FLAG-CoaSt6 (or the Coast6(E1810K) mutant) and FLAG-p100 were transfected into ΦNX cells followed by immunoprecipitation of cell extracts with anti-FLAG antibodies. Shown are the results of autoradiography of the products after PARP assays using [32P]NAD+ (upper panel), as described for Fig. 1a, and of anti-FLAG We"
https://openalex.org/W2047392065,"Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signals primarily through the Smad proteins to regulate cell growth, differentiation, and extracellular matrix production. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play an important role in the regulation of the Smad proteins. TGFβ signaling results in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 that then oligomerize with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus to initiate transcription of TGFβ target genes. The initiation of transcription is significantly enhanced by the direct interaction of the Smad complex with p300/CBP (CREB-binding protein), a co-activator with intrinsic acetyltransferase activity. However, how p300/CBP enhances transcription through this interaction is not entirely understood. In this report, we show that Smad2, but not the highly homologous Smad3, can be acetylated by p300/CBP in a ligand-dependent manner. At least three lysine residues, Lys19, Lys20, and Lys39, are required for efficient acetylation of Smad2, as mutations altering these lysines abolished Smad2 acetylation in vivo. This acetylation event is required for the ability of Smad2 to mediate activin and TGFβ signaling. Mutation of the three key lysine residues did not alter the stability of Smad2 or the ability of Smad2 to form a complex with Smad4 on promoter DNA, but it prevented nuclear accumulation of Smad2 and subsequent TGFβ and activin responses.

TGFβ signaling is initiated when ligands of the TGFβ signaling superfamily such as activin and TGFβ bind to and activate the TGFβ serine/threonine kinase receptor complex (1Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar, 2Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activated receptor complex then phosphorylates receptor-activated Smads, such as Smad2 and Smad3, on the SSXS motif in the C termini, enabling nuclear translocation and oligomerization with the common mediator Smad4 (3Abdollah S.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, this Smad heteromeric complex binds to target promoter sequences and recruits transcriptional coactivators to regulate transcription of TGFβ target genes (1Feng X.H. Derynck R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar, 5ten Dijke P.H.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Smad2 and Smad3 mediate both activin and TGFβ signaling and share 92% sequence identity. However, there are several salient differences between the two. First of all, Smad2 contains two extra peptide inserts, named the GAG and TID regions, respectively, that are not present in Smad3 (6Dennler S. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The TID domain (also known as exon3) in Smad2 prevents the direct binding of Smad2 to DNA, whereas Smad3 can bind DNA directly (7Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Secondly, mice lacking Smad2 or Smad3 display very different phenotypes. Smad2 knock-out mice are embryonic lethal at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) with vascular and cranial abnormalities and impaired left-right patterning (8Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Lia M. Boettinger E.

Cell. 1998; 92: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Smad3-null mice, however, are viable but suffer from impaired immune function and chronic inflammation (11Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Pan L. Borton A.J. Zhuang Y. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 2495-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the stability and intracellular localization of Smad3 and Smad2 are also regulated by different mechanisms (13Massague J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). Thus, many functional and regulatory differences exist between these two proteins. Both Smad2 and Smad3 bind to and recruit the coactivator p300/CBP to enhance transcriptional activity of the activated Smad complex. p300 was first identified as an E1A-associated protein and displays high levels of sequence and functional homology with the CREB-binding protein, CBP (14Janknecht R. Histol. Histopathol. 2002; 17: 657-668PubMed Google Scholar). Initially identified as a scaffolding protein to bridge two proteins together, p300 also functions to transfer the acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the lysine residues in histones allowing remodeling of chromatin to a more open relaxed conformation for transcription (15Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Acetylation of histones can be reversed by the activity of histone deacetylases (HDAC), which returns the active chromatin back to its closed, inactive form by removal of acetyl groups (18Wu J. Grunstein M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In the past decade, many non-histone proteins, such as p53, β-catenin, importin-α, E1A, and Smad7 (19Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar, 20Wolf D. Rodova M. Miska E.A. Calvet J.P. Kouzarides T. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), have been shown to be acetylated by p300 and other acetyltransferase proteins such as P/CAF and GCN. Acetylation of non-histone proteins can result in alterations of biochemical and functional activities of the substrate proteins. For example, acetylation appears to inhibit the interaction of E1A with importin-α, decreasing its nuclear import (22Madison D.L. Yaciuk P. Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38755-38763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Acetylation can alter the intracellular localization of proteins such as c-Abl and can also compete with other modifications such as ubiquitination and sumoylation in proteins like p53 and Smad7 (21Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 23Li M. Luo J. Brooks C.L. Gu W. J. Biol.

Acetylation of Smad7, an inhibitory Smad, increases its stability by modifying the lysine residues required for ubiquitin attachment, preventing ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (25Simonsson M. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Gronroos E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21797-21803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Finally, acetylation may alter the intracellular localization, DNA binding, and other post-translational modifications of proteins (26Glozak M.A. Sengupta N. Zhang X. Seto E. Gene. 2005; 363: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). The MH2 domains of Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 interact directly with the C-terminal domain of p300/CBP, resulting in increases in the transcriptional activity of the Smad complex (27Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 28Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T.

Cell. 1998; 9: 3309-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Disruption of this interaction through overexpression of adenovirus E1A significantly decreases transcription by the Smad complex (32Nishihara A. Hanai J. Imamura T. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28716-28723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Smad3 has also been shown to interact with HDAC1 directly through its MH1 domain and recruit it to the promoter DNA to inhibit transcription (33Liberati N.T. Moniwa M. Borton A.J. Davie J.R. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22595-22603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that the Smad proteins activate transcription by recruiting the p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase to the chromatin to remodel it into the active, open confirmation (34Ross S. Cheung E. Petrakis T.G. Howell M. Kraus W.L. Hill C.S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4490-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, whether this is the only mechanism by which p300/CBP enhances Smad transcription is not clear. Indeed, Inoue et al. (35Inoue Y. Itoh Y. Abe K. Okamoto T. Daitoku H. Fukamizu A. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) recently reported acetylation of Smad3 on lysine 378 by p300/CBP in cells treated with trichostatin A (TSA). While this manuscripts was being prepared, a new study by Simonsson et al. (36Simonsson M. Kanduri M. Gronroos E. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39870-39880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) also reported identification of an acetylation site in Smad2 that appears to be important for the DNA binding activity of the alternatively spliced form of Smad2 but has no effect on the signaling activity of WT Smad2. In this study, we carried out a detailed analysis of acetylation of Smad proteins by p300. We show that Smad2, but not Smad3, can be acetylated in a p300-dependent manner and that this modification requires lysines 19, 20, and 39 in Smad2. We further show that this acetylation event plays a role in promoting the nuclear accumulation of Smad2 upon TGFβ stimulation, leading to the increase in downstream TGFβ responses. Our work thus has uncovered a novel mechanism by which p300/CBP enhances TGFβ signaling through direct modification of Smad2. Cell Culture and Reagents—293T and NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FBS. Hep3B human heptoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in minimum Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Smad2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts obtained from Dr. Anita Roberts were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FBS, sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and glutamate (2 mm). Monoclonal antibodies specific for acetylated lysine were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Smad2 antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories and Smad3 (FL-425) and TGFβ receptor (TGFβRI; V22) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG, anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies and TSA were purchased from Sigma. Anti-phospho-Smad2 antisera were a generous gift from Aristidis Moustakas (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). SB-431542 was purchased from Tocris. Transfection and Stable Cell Lines—Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. To generate stable cell lines, Smad2-null mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells were co-transfected with wild type or mutant FLAG-Smad2 and pBABEpuro, which contains a puromycin resistance gene. After 48 h, transfected cells were selected by growing in medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in high salt lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 3 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF). FLAG-Smad2 was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG followed by elution with FLAG peptide as described previously (37Zhou Q. Chen D. Pierstorff E. Luo K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3681-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 38Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out as described previously (39Luo K. Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In Vitro Acetylation Assay—Purified GST-Smad fusion proteins were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in acetylation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05 μCi of 14C-acetyl coenzyme A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of GST-tagged histone acetylation domain of p300 (GST-p300-HAT). Samples were resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography using a phosphorimaging system. Mass Spectrometry—FLAG-tagged Smad2, isolated from 293T cells co-transfected with full-length p300 by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG, were eluted with FLAG peptide and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The Smad2 band was then excised from the gel, digested with chymotrypsin, and run through a Thermo Finnigan LCQ DECA XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer interfaced with a Shimadzu Binary HPLC to carry out liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Luciferase Assay—MEF cells were transiently transfected with the promoter reporter constructs and FLAG-tagged wild type or mutant Smad2. At 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved and treated with 50 pm TGFβ for 16 h. Luciferin levels were measured as described previously (38Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Luo K. Science. 1999; 286: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Growth Inhibition Assay—1 × 104 MEF cells were seeded in 6-well plates and stimulated with different concentrations of TGFβ1 for 4 days. Cells were counted and compared with the number of unstimulated cells to determine relative cell growth. Pulse-Chase Assay—293T cells were co-transfected with full-length p300 and FLAG-tagged wild type or mutant Smad2. At 24 h after transfection, cells were pulsed with 0.5 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in pulse media (cysteine/methionine-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium plus 10% dialyzed FBS) for 30 min. Cells were then washed with regular media and chased for different periods of time. 35S-Labeled Smad2 was then isolated by immunoprecipitation, resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and detected by autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—DNA fragments containing the Smad-binding element as described previously (40Zhu Q. Pearson-White S. Luo K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 10731-10744Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were end-labeled with 32P, gel-purified, and incubated with affinity-purified Smad2-Smad4 complex to test for DNA binding ability. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% nondenaturing gel. For antibody supershift assays, the Smad2-Smad4 complexes were preincubated with 4 μg of the specified antibody for 1 h at 4°C before EMSA was performed. Immunofluorescence—Cells were seeded on sterile glass slides and treated with 100 ng/ml TSA for 8 h before staining. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with blocking buffer (10% newborn calf serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline), and stained with anti-FLAG as described previously (41Krakowski A.R. Laboureau J. Mauviel A. Bissell M.J. Luo K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12437-12442Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized on an Axiophot epifluorescence microscope or a confocal LSM 510 microscope (Zeiss). To study protein shuttling, cells were treated for 30 min with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide before stimulation with 100 pm TGFβ. Cells were then treated with 10 μm SB-431542 prior to immunostaining. Cell Fractionation Assay—Cells were fractionated as described previously (42Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed using Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) to isolate the cytoplasmic fraction. The remaining lysate was then resuspended in Buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) to extract the nuclear contents. Smad2 Is Acetylated in the Presence of p300—To determine whether Smad proteins could be acetylated, a panel of FLAG-tagged Smad proteins were transiently transfected into 293T cells together with full-length p300 (Fig. 1A). Smad7 had been shown previously to be acetylated in the presence of p300 (21Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and therefore was included as a positive control. Smad proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG beads, and their acetylation status was evaluated by Western blotting with anti-acetyl lysine-specific antiserum. Under this condition, in addition to Smad7, only Smad2 was acetylated when coexpressed with p300. Interestingly, the highly homologous Smad3 was not significantly acetylated. The observed difference in acetylation between Smad2 and Smad3 is particularly interesting because of the high sequence identity between the two. To determine whether p300 could directly acetylate Smad2, an in vitro acetylation assay was performed using bacterially expressed Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 and the purified acetyltransferase domain of p300 (Fig. 1B) or CBP (data not shown). Again, strong acetylation of Smad2 was observed in the presence of p300 or CBP, suggesting that p300/CBP can directly acetylate Smad2. In the same reaction, Smad3 and Smad4 also appeared to be labeled, but these signals were much weaker if significant at all when compared with that of Smad2. Thus, we decided to focus on the acetylation of Smad2 for the rest of the study. Endogenous Smad2 Is Also Acetylated—To demonstrate that endogenous Smad2 is also acetylated and that this acetylation event is subjected to regulation by TGFβ, endogenous Smad2 was isolated from Hep3B cells treated with or without TGFβ by immunoprecipitation with anti-Smad2 and subjected to Western blotting with anti-acetyl lysine-specific antibody. In the absence of TGFβ, Smad2 is acetylated but at a very low level. Treatment with TGFβ induced increased acetylation of Smad2 (Fig. 1C). This was expected because p300 is localized only in the nucleus, and its interaction with Smad2 increases upon nuclear accumulation of Smad2 as a result of TGFβ stimulation. This acetylation of Smad2 was further enhanced by treatment with TSA, an inhibitor of HDACs, suggesting that Smad2 acetylation is reversible and can be regulated by HDACs (Fig. 1D). To further confirm that acetylation of Smad2 indeed occurs in the nucleus, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared from Hep3B cells, and acetylation of Smad2 was determined as described above. A low level of acetylated Smad2 could be detected in the nuclear fraction in the absence of TGFβ stimulation, but this acetylation was significantly enhanced in the presence of TGFβ (Fig. 1E). In contrast, no acetylated Smad2 was detected in the cytoplasmic fractions either in the presence of absence of TGFβ. Thus, acetylation of Smad2 occurs primarily in the nucleus. The GAG Region of Smad2 Is Required for Acetylation—To identify the sites of acetylation in Smad2, we co-transfected Smad2/Smad3 chimeras swapping the MH1 or MH2 domains of Smad2 together with p300 into 293T cells and evaluated the acetylation of these mutants by Western blotting (Fig. 2, A and B). The N-terminal MH1 domain appeared to be necessary and sufficient for Smad2 acetylation (Fig. 2B). Within the MH1 domain, the major difference between Smad2 and Smad3 is the presence of the GAG and TID domains in Smad2 but not in Smad3. Deletion of the GAG domain from Smad2 significantly impaired Smad2 acetylation, whereas removal of the TID domain had no effect (Fig. 2C), suggesting that acetylation of Smad2 requires the GAG region. Consistent with this, when the GAG region was inserted into Smad3, acetylation of Smad3 was observed at levels comparable with that of wild type Smad2 (Fig. 2D). Thus, the GAG domain of Smad2 is both necessary and sufficient for Smad2 acetylation. Identifying Smad2 Acetylation Sites—There are many lysine residues in the MH1 domain of Smad2, most of which are conserved in Smad3 with the exception of Lys144, which is uniquely present in Smad2. However, mutation of this lysine did not affect the acetylation of Smad2 (data not shown), indicating that Lys144 is not the site of acetylation. It is likely, therefore, that the GAG region of Smad2 confers a difference in conformation between Smad2 and Smad3 that causes the surrounding lysines in Smad2 to be more accessible to acetylation by p300. Two complementary approaches were taken to identify the sites of acetylation in Smad2. In the first approach, we employed mass spectrometry to detect lysine residues with N-linked acetylation modifications in FLAG-Smad2 isolated from 293T cells co-overexpressing p300. Mass spectrometry identified three lysine residues, lysines 19, 20, and 39, as possible acetylated residues (Fig. 3B). In the second approach, point mutations changing combinations of lysines to arginines (Fig. 3A) in the area proximal to the GAG region were generated and examined for acetylation. Mutation of lysines 19 and 20, either by themselves or in combination with other lysine residues (for example 3K13R; see Fig. 3A for diagram of Smad2 Lys-Arg point mutants), resulted in a significant loss of Smad2 acetylation, whereas mutations of all other lysine residues in this area did not affect acetylation (Fig. 3C). This suggests that Lys19 and Lys20 are required for Smad2 acetylation. However, they are not the only sites of acetylation, because the 2K19R mutant was still acetylated effectively in an in vitro acetylation assay (Fig. 3D). This is consistent with the result obtained from the mass spectrometry analysis showing that Lys39 is also an acetylation site. Although mutation of Lys39 alone did not significantly affect Smad2 acetylation and only partially inhibited its transcriptional activity (see Fig. 5), mutation of Lys19, Lys20, and Lys39 abolished acetylation and Smad2 signaling (Figs. 3C and 5). Taken together, our study suggests that Smad2 can be acetylated on three lysine residues, Lys19, Lys20, and Lys39.FIGURE 5Acetylation of Smad2 is required for activin and TGFβ signaling. WT or mutant Smad2 was co-transfected into Smad2-null MEF together with either ARE-lux (A) or p3TP-lux (B). Cells were treated with 50 pm TGFβ for16 h, and a luciferase assay was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, WT or 3K19R Smad2 was stably introduced into Smad2-null MEF. Cells were treated with increasing concentration of TGFβ for 4 days, and cell growth was evaluated by cell counting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Smad2 Phosphorylation and Acetylation Occur Independently of Each Other—Stimulation of TGFβ results in the phosphorylation of Smad2 in the C-terminal serine residues, leading to its oligomerization with Smad4 and nuclear translocation. To elucidate whether the C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad2 is necessary for acetylation, a Smad2 3S-3A mutant lacking the C-terminal phosphorylation sites was transfected into 293T cells along with full-length p300 (Fig. 4A). Although endogenous Smad2 needs to be phosphorylated to accumulate in the nucleus, immunofluorescence staining confirmed that overexpressed Smad2 3S-3A can bypass this requirement and accumulate in the nucleus even without TGFβ stimulation (Fig. 4B). When thus overexpressed, the Smad2 3S-3A mutant was acetylated to a similar level as the wild type protein, indicating that Smad2 in the nucleus does not need to be phosphorylated for acetylation to occur. Similarly, acetylation of Smad2 did not alter the phosphorylation state of the protein. Wild type and 3K19R mutant Smad2 were phosphorylated to similar levels when co-transfected with p300 into 293T cells (Fig. 4C). Thus, although phosphorylation of Smad2 is necessary to for its nuclear translocation, once in the nucleus acetylation of Smad2 can occur independently of its phosphorylation status. Acetylation of Smad2 Is Required for Activin and TGFβ Signaling—To determine the effects of Smad2 acetylation on TGFβ signaling, we first measured TGFβ- and activin-dependent transcription using luciferase reporter constructs specific for activin (ARE-lux) or TGFβ (p3TP-lux) signaling. Western blotting was performed to ensure equal levels of Smad2 and 3K19R expression in the transfected cells (data not shown). MEFs isolated from the Smad2-null mice (43Piek E. Ju W.J. Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19945-19953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) were used to avoid any potential interference by endogenous Smad2. Unlike WT MEF, which displayed strong activation of ARE-lux upon activation of activin signaling, Smad2-null MEF no longer supported transcription from ARE-lux (Fig. 5A). Transfection of wild type Smad2 restored the transcription activation to the Smad2-deficient MEF. In contrast, introduction of the 3K19R mutant did not rescue activin-induced transcriptional activation. Similarly, wild type but not the 3K19R mutant conferred TGFβ-induced transactivation to Smad2-null MEF (Fig. 5B). Thus, acetylation of Smad2 is required for activin- and TGFβ-induced transcriptional responses. Consistent with this, a mutant that mimics the acetylated state of Smad2 (3K19Q) exhibited a moderate but reproducible increase in transcription (Fig. 5, A and B) when expressed at a similar level as WT Smad2 (data not shown). To discern the contribution of each of the three acetylated lysine residues to activin- and TGFβ-induced transcription responses, mutations altering each of the individual lysine residues (K19R, K20R, K39R) or two in combination (K19R/K20R, K19R/K39R, K20R/K39R) ("

The best characterized function of TG2 is its calcium-dependent transamidating acyltransferase activity that cross-links glutamine with lysine residues in the same proteins, resulting in polymerization or with lysine residues in other proteins, resulting in protein cross-linking. It has also been reported to be a protein-disulfide isomerase (3Hasegawa G. Suwa M. Ichikawa Y. Ohtsuka T. Kumagai S. Kikuchi M. Sato Y. Saito Y. Biochem.

The Km and Vmax for TG2-induced phosphorylation of the IGFBP-3 were in the physiological range (6Mishra S. Murphy L.J. J. Biol.

Evidence now exists that TG2 can both promote apoptosis and protect against cell death depending upon cell type, apoptotic stimulus, and subcellular localization of TG2 (14Sarang Z. Molnar P.

TG2 activity catalyzing the formation of ϵ.γ glutamyllysine cross-links between polypeptide chains and the formation of apoptotic bodies seems important in the later stages in the apoptotic process (16Griffin M.

The rise in intracellular Ca2+ that accompanies many pro-apoptotic stimuli may be responsible for the activation of the cross-linking activity of TG2 (17Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E.

Tucholski J. McCoy E. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8715-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The protective effect of TG2 in this experimental paradigm appears to require Rb but does not involve polymerization of Rb (21Milakovic T. Tucholski J. McCoy E. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8715-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In other circumstance cross-linking of Rb appears to be important in the anti-apoptotic effect of TG2 (22Boehm J.E. Singh U. Coombs C. Antonyak M.A. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20127-20130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus the interaction between TG2 and Rb is complex and remains poorly understood.Rb is involved in regulating the expression of genes that favor cell cycle progression and suppressing the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, and its phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of its function. Because Rb has been shown to be a substrate for the transamidating activity of TG2, we investigated whether TG2 could also phosphorylate Rb.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and Proteins—IGFBP-3, goat polyclonal TG2 antibody, and the Rb773–928 fragment were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Full-length recombinant Rb protein was purchased from QED Bioscience Inc. (San Diego). Recombinant His-tagged human TG2, from Roboscreen Germany, was used for most experiments unless otherwise stated. Recombinant human TG2 expressed in Escherichia coli was purchased from Neomarkers Inc. (Fremont, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti E2F1, rabbit polyclonal anti-Rb, rabbit polyclonal anti-Rb (Ser780), and rabbit polyclonal PKAα antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PKA catalytic subunit was from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). The PKA inhibitor H89 was from Calbiochem. Dibutyryl-cAMP, guinea pig liver TG2, mouse monoclonal anti-phosphothreonine (clone PTR-8), anti-phosphoserine (clone PSR-45), anti-phosphotyrosine (clone PT-66) antibodies, and all other reagents unless otherwise stated were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.In-gel Kinase Assay—Human recombinant TG2 (500 ng) was separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE to which 50 μg/ml IGFBP-3 was added just prior to polymerization. After electrophoresis, SDS was removed from the gel by washing twice for 30 min in 20% 2-propanol in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at room temperature. The enzyme was denatured by incubating the gel for 20 min at room temperature in 6 m guanidine-HCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Subsequently, the protein was renatured in six changes in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.04% Tween 20, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 18 h. The gel was preincubated in assay buffer (40 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EGTA) for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated in assay buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 2 h at 30 °C. After incubation, the gel was washed five times for 5 min each at room temperature in 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1% sodium pyrophosphate. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and processed for autoradiography.In Vitro Kinase Assay—250 ng of phospholipase A2, Rb773–928 fragment, PKA, and adenylyl cyclase were incubated with 25 ng of TG2 in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 60 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP) in a final volume of 30 μl for 30 min at 30 °C. In some cases Rb773–928 was phosphorylated in the presence of Ca2+. In some cases full-length recombinant Rb protein was used. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed on 11% PAGE. Subsequently, gels were dried and processed for autoradiography. In some cases proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and processed for Western blot.Western Blotting—Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk and incubated with the respective primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. For detection of phosphospecific amino acids, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, membranes were washed three times in TBST (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 8.0)) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing membranes were analyzed with ECL.Disruption of Rb·E2F1 Complexes—MCF-7 cells, obtained from ATCC and cultured as described previously (6Mishra S. Murphy L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23863-23868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), were exposed for 12–15 h to 50 μm proteosome inhibitor, N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal. 20 μl of anti-E2F1 antibody was added to 1 ml of MCF-7 cell lysate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. 25 μl of protein A-agarose was added and further incubated on a rotating device overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the pellet was washed four times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and finally suspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP). 200 ng of Rb773–928 fragment or full-length Rb protein was added and kept on ice for 1 h. Subsequently 20 ng of recombinant TG2 was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Subsequently tubes were transferred to ice, and Rb that had dissociated from the immobilized E2F1 was washed away by centrifugation. In some cases ATP or TG2 was omitted from the reaction mixture. The fraction of Rb that remained bound to the immunoprecipitate was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-Rb antibody (1:500).Enzymatic Assay of TG2 Cross-linking and Kinase Activities—To determine the effect of PKA-induced phosphorylation on the activities of the TG2, 250 ng of human recombinant His-tagged TG2 was immobilized on 25 μl of nickel-agarose (Sigma). Free unbound TG2 was removed by centrifugation and washing, and the immobilized TG2 was suspended in 40 μl of PKA assay buffer (containing 20 ng PKA, 100 μm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Subsequently tubes were transferred to ice, and the immobilized TG2 was washed three times in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) to remove the reaction mixture and resuspended in 40 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4). 5 μl of nickel-agarose-immobilized phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated TG2 was used for the TG2-induced kinase assay (as above), and 25 μl of resuspension was used for the TG2-induced transamidation reaction. Controls included reactions where ATP or PKA was omitted from the preincubation and where H89 (100 nm), an inhibitor of PKA, was included. In some experiments immobilized phosphorylated TG2 was subsequently dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase (3 unit/reaction) prior to testing for cross-linking activity. TG2 cross-linking activity was determined by the formation of hydroxamate from sodium-benzoylcarbonyl (CBZ)-glutaminylglycine and hydroxylamine using l-glutamic acid γ-monohydroxamate as standard (23Folk J.E. Cole P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3238-3240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated immobilized TG2 were added in a 0.23-ml reaction mix containing 174 mm Tris, 31 mm benzoylcarbonyl-glutaminylglycine, 87 mm hydroxylamine, 8.7 mm glutathione reduced form, and 4 mm CaCl2 and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. At the end of the incubation absorbance was measured at 525 nm.Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) Culture and Flow Cytometry—MEF obtained from wild type TG2+/+ and TG2–/– mice were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere (24de Laurenzi V. Melino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For cell cycle analysis, cells were collected by trypsinization, pelleted at 800 × g for 10 min, and fixed in 70% ethanol. DNA content was evaluated by flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining. Twenty thousand events were evaluated by using the CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). Electronic gating (forward scatter area versus forward scatter height) was used, when appropriate, to eliminate cell aggregates and to identify the various cell populations. The same method was used to evaluate the cell cycle by using ModFit LT software (Verity Software). MEFtg2+/+ and MEFtg2–/– cells were plated at equal concentrations 24 h before pulsing for 30 min with 10 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Cells were then washed, harvested by trypsinization, and fixed for 30 min at –20 °C in ethanol. DNA was denatured for 30 min using 2 m HCl and 0.5% TX-100 at room temperature and soon after were partially renatured for 10 min in sodium borate buffer (100 mm, pH 8.5). Sample were then incubated for 60 min with anti-BrdUrd antibody (Novocastra Labs, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) diluted 1:100, washed, and incubated for 30 min with secondary antibody (Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-mouse, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and propidium iodide (100 μg/ml). Cells were measured using a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) exciting with a 488 nm argon laser. Cell cycle analysis was performed using CellQuest and MODFIT software (BD Biosciences).Activation of PKA in MEFs—MEFtg2+/+ and MEFtg2–/– cells were plated in full media. After 72 h in culture the medium was exchanged for serum-free media, and cells were serum-starved for 6 h. Subsequently cells were treated with dibutyryl-cAMP (100 μm) in the presence and absence of the PKA inhibitor H89 (100 nm). Cell lysates were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) (120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 mm NaVO5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). 20 μl of goat polyclonal anti-TG2 (Upstate Biotechnology) or rabbit polyclonal anti-Rb antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to 1 ml of MEF cell lysate and incubated on a rotating device overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose, 25 μl, was added to each tube and the incubation continued for 2 h. At the end of the incubation, the pellet was washed four times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Subsequently membranes were processed for immunoblot with anti-TG2 (1:1000), anti-phosphoserine (1:5000), anti-Rb (1:500) and anti-phospho-Ser780 (1:250). After incubation with the respective secondary antibodies-horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 1 h at room temperature, membranes were washed and analyzed with ECL.RESULTSTG2 Phosphorylates Rb at Ser780—TG2 kinase activity was originally identified as the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 in human breast cancer cell (6Mishra S. Murphy L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23863-23868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To confirm that the kinase activity was due to TG2 rather than a contaminating, or closely associated, kinase, an in-gel kinase assay was performed using recombinant human TG2 with IGFBP-3 as a substrate (supplemental Fig. 1). A single band was observed, corresponding in size to TG2 identified on the Coomassie-stained gel.TG2 has been implicated in the cross-linking or activation of a variety of other signaling proteins in apoptosis and cell proliferation.

Because protein phosphorylation is central to the activation of many of these signaling pathways, we investigated whether TG2 was able to phosphorylate some of these important signaling proteins (Fig. 1A). TG2 was unable to phosphorylate adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase A2, or PKA. The catalytic subunit of PKA undergoes autophosphorylation. Of the proteins examined only Rb773–928 fragment was phosphorylated by TG2, which contains 7 of the 16 potential (Ser/Thr) phosphoacceptor sites in Rb (30Kaelin W.G. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This kinase activity was also observed with both guinea pig liver TG2 and human recombinant TG2 expressed in E. coli (data not shown). Interestingly we observed an ∼78-kDa band corresponding to the molecular mass of TG2 in the presence of PKA and ATP in the autoradiograph (Fig. 1A). Because there are presumably only two proteins in the reaction, this result suggest that TG2 is phosphorylated by PKA, because this band is not seen in the absence of PKA (Fig. 1A).To further confirm PKA-induced phosphorylation of TG2, TG2 was incubated with PKA and ATP and then processed for immunoblotting with phosphoamino-specific antibodies. Anti-phosphoserine antibody recognizes both PKA and TG2 in the presence of ATP but fail to recognize TG2 in the absence of PKA (Fig. 2A), suggesting that PKA-induced phosphorylation of TG2 occurs at the serine residue. Anti-phosphothreonine did not recognize PKA-induced phosphorylated TG2 (data not shown).FIGURE 2PKA phosphorylates TG2. Recombinant TG2 (250 ng) was incubated with active PKA (25 ng) and ATP (100 μm) for 30 min at 30 °C. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and processed for Western immunoblot. A, anti-phosphoserine (1:5000) immunoblot is shown. TG2 was recognized by anti-phosphoserine only in the presence of ATP and PKA. Active PKA, which undergoes autophosphorylation, was also recognized by the anti-phosphoserine antibody. B, the same membrane was reprobed with anti-PKA antibody (1:250).

Heyman R.A. Chandraratna R.A. Davies P.J. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 4: 534-547Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We confirmed that Ca2+ enhanced cross-linking of Rb773–928 induced by TG2 (31Singh U.S. Kunar M.T. Kao Y.L. Baker K.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) but observed that Ca2+ inhibited TG2-induced phosphorylation of Rb773–928 fragment (Fig. 1B). High molecular weight forms of Rb773–928 were only lightly phosphorylated compared with monomeric Rb773–928. Incontrast, ATP appeared to enhance kinase activity and inhibit TG2 cross-linking activity (Fig. 1, C and D). These data are consistent with the recent report by Lee et al. (32Lee S.C. Kim J.H. Park E.S. Kim D.K. Kim Y.G. Yun H.Y. Kwon N.S. Im M.J. Baek K.J. Mol. Cells. 2003; 16: 285-290PubMed Google Scholar) that Ca2+ inhibits the GTP binding and GTPase activity of TG2.Using phosphoamino acid-specific antibodies we demonstrated that TG2-induced phosphorylation occurred predominantly at the serine residues. Phosphotyrosine (data not shown) and phosphothreonine antibodies did not recognize TG2-induced phosphorylated Rb773–928 fragment, whereas phosphoserine antibody recognized Rb773–928 fragment that had been phosphorylated by TG2 (Fig. 3A). Of the 10 potential phosphoserine acceptor sites in Rb, five are present in the C-terminal region of the molecule and are present in the Rb773–928 fragment. TG2 was able to phosphorylate Ser780 (Fig. 3B). This region of Rb is involved in binding to the E2F family of transcription factors, which are important in cell cycle progression (31Singh U.S. Kunar M.T. Kao Y.L. Baker K.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3TG2 phosphorylates Ser780 in Rb and modulates its interaction with E2F1. A, Rb773–928 (250 ng) fragment was incubated with TG2 (25 ng) and ATP (100 μm) at 30 °C for 30 min. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. Phosphothreonine antibody failed to recognize phosphorylated Rb773–928 fragment, whereas anti-phosphoserine recognized Rb773–928 fragment. Phosphoserine-bovine serum albumin (ps-BSA) and phosphothreonine-bovine serum albumin (pt-BSA) were included as positive controls (upper panels). This experiment was repeated three times. B, Rb773–928 was phosphorylated with TG2 and probed with phospho-specific antibody that recognized Rb phosphorylated at Ser780. The dilutions of the antibodies used were 1:5000, 1:5000, and 1:250 for anti-phosphoserine, anti-phosphothreonine, and Ser780-specific anti-phospho-Rb, respectively. An anti-Rb (1:500) immunoblot is shown as a control. C, E2F1 was immunoprecipitated from MCF-7 cell lysates with protein A-agarose and incubated with 200 ng of Rb fragment or with full-length recombinant protein in the presence or absence of TG2 (20 ng) and ATP (100μm). The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and subsequently was transferred to ice. After washing, the beads were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and the attached proteins resolved by electrophoresis. The residual Rb fragment or full-length Rb protein was quantified by immunoblotting and densitometry. A representative blot is shown (upper panel), and the data from four independent experiments are depicted in the lower panel. D, 200 ng of Rb fragment or full-length Rb protein was incubated with 20 ng of His-TG2 in the presence or absence of ATP (100 μm) for 30 min at 30 °C. Subsequently TG2 was pulled down using nickel-agarose (20 μl). After washing, pulled down proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) using anti-TG2 (1:1000) and anti-Rb (1:500) antibodies. The experiment was repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphorylation of Rb by TG2 Disrupts the Rb-E2F1 Interaction—In this experiment, in addition to full-length recombinant Rb protein we have also used Rb773–928 fragment because it has been shown that phosphorylation of Rb at the C terminus modulates binding to E2F1. Here we have shown that the C-terminal fragment of Rb is subject to phosphorylation at a critical residue by TG2 kinase activity.We immunoprecipitated E2F1 from MCF-7 breast cancer cells using anti-E2F1 antibody and protein A-agarose to determine whether TG2-induced phosphorylation of Rb affected the interaction with E2F. The precipitates were incubated with either the Rb773–928 fragment or with full-length Rb. Aliquots of the immobilized Rb·E2F1 complex were then incubated with kinase buffer alone, TG2 in kinase buffer, or in TG2 plus ATP. After washing, the amount of residual Rb was quantified by immunoblotting (Fig. 3C). TG2 in the presence of ATP significantly reduced the amount of Rb in the pellet by ∼33–40%. This reduction in bound Rb was not observed in the absence of ATP. Furthermore, this effect was not due to co-precipitation of another contaminating kinase, because ATP alone had no effect on the amount of Rb in the pellet.To further confirm that dissociation of Rb from Rb·E2F1 complex was due to TG2-induced phosphorylation of Rb and not to binding to TG2 in the presence of ATP and subsequent loss during washing, His-TG2 was incubated with the Rb fragment and full-length Rb in the presence and absence of ATP. Subsequently TG2 was pulled down using nickel-agarose. Pulled down proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-TG2 and anti-Rb antibodies. No significant difference in Rb levels was found in the presence or absence of ATP (Fig, 3D), suggesting that loss of Rb from Rb·E2F1 complex was due to TG2-induced phosphorylation of Rb and not to increased binding to TG2 in the presence of ATP.Cell Cycle Progression in MEFtg2+/+ and MEFtg2–/– Cells— Because TG2 appeared to modulate Rb-E2F interactions, we evaluate the progression of MEFtg2+/+ and MEFtg2–/– cells through the cell cycle phases. A reduced progression through the S phase in MEFtg2–/– cells was demonstrated using flow cytometry and staining with propidium iodide (Fig. 4, top). This finding was confirmed by BrdUrd staining (Fig. 4, middle).FIGURE 4A reduced progression through the S phase in MEFtg2–/– cells.

To assess the mechanisms of skin color variation, human skin substitutes (HSS) were constructed by grafting mixtures of cultured keratinocytes and melanocytes from a combination of donor skin types, together with light skin derived fibroblasts, into chambers inserted onto the back skin of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. The resulting complexion coloration of the HSS was relatively darker and lighter when dark and light skin derived keratinocytes, respectively, were combined with melanocytes derived from either light or dark skin. The melanin content in the epidermis and the maturation stage of melanosomes in basal keratinocytes were significantly increased in the HSS composed of dark compared to light skin derived keratinocytes. In addition, the ratio of individual/clustered melanosomes in recipient keratinocytes was increased in the former as opposed to the latter HSS. The genetic expression of endothelin-1, proopiomelanocortin, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, tyrosinase, GP100, and MART1 were increased in HSS composed of dark vs. light skin derived keratinocytes. These data suggest that our HSS is a promising melanogenic model that demonstrates the role of the keratinocyte in regulating in part both melanogenesis and distribution of transferred melanosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2147075761,"Sustained positive BOLD (blood oxygen level-dependent) activity is employed extensively in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies as evidence for task or stimulus-specific neural responses. However, the presence of sustained negative BOLD activity (i.e., sustained responses that are lower than the fixation baseline) has remained more difficult to interpret. Some studies suggest that it results from local “blood stealing” wherein blood is diverted to neurally active regions without a concomitant change of neural activity in the negative BOLD regions. However, other evidence suggests that negative BOLD is a result of local neural suppression. In both cases, regions of negative BOLD response are usually interpreted as carrying relatively little, if any, stimulus-specific information (hence the predominant reliance on positive BOLD activity in fMRI). Here we show that the negative BOLD response resulting from visual stimulation can carry high information content that is stimulus-specific. Using a general linear model (GLM), we contrasted standard flickering stimuli to a fixation baseline and found regions of the visual cortex that displayed a sustained negative BOLD response, consistent with several previous studies. Within these negative BOLD regions, we compared patterns of fMRI activity generated by flickering Gabors that were systematically shifted in position. As the Gabors were shifted further from each other, the correlation in the spatial pattern of activity across a population of voxels (such as the population of V1 voxels that displayed a negative BOLD response) decreased significantly. Despite the fact that the BOLD signal was significantly negative (lower than fixation baseline), these regions were able to discriminate objects separated by less than 0.5 deg (at ∼10 deg eccentricity). The results suggest that meaningful, stimulus-specific processing occurs even in regions that display a strong negative BOLD response."
https://openalex.org/W2120310232,"Embryonic stem cells combine the features of robust proliferation with precise differentiation capacity. p27 is a cell cycle inhibitor that is involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation in many developing tissues. Recent studies in murine embryonic stem cells have suggested that p27 is involved in the progression of normal differentiation programs in these cells. However, the expression and regulation of p27 and its role in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESc) has not been previously explored. Herein we show that p27 expression was low in undifferentiated hESc, but increased markedly in differentiated cells. The expression of Skp2, the ubiquitin ligase that targets p27 for degradation, was inversely related to p27 expression. Moreover, embryoid bodies (EBs) with low p27 expression and high Skp2/p27 ratio showed poorer differentiation than those with high p27 expression. Modulation of Skp2 expression is mainly regulated by its rate of degradation. In contrast to somatic cells, which have high levels of Skp2 mainly in S and G2/M, in undifferentiated hESc Skp2 levels were also high in G1. These results point to a potentially important role for p27 regulation in hESc."
https://openalex.org/W1985550099,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the major environmental factor associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), a common lymphoma in young adults. Natural killer (NK) cells are key actors of the innate immune response against viruses. The regulation of NK cell function involves activating and inhibitory Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), which are expressed in variable numbers on NK cells. Various viral and virus-related malignant disorders have been associated with the presence/absence of certain KIR genes in case/control studies. We investigated the role of the KIR cluster in HL in a family-based association study.We included 90 families with 90 HL index cases (age 16-35 years) and 255 first-degree relatives (parents and siblings). We developed a procedure for reconstructing full genotypic information (number of gene copies) at each KIR locus from the standard KIR gene content. Out of the 90 collected families, 84 were informative and suitable for further analysis. An association study was then carried out with specific family-based analysis methods on these 84 families.Five KIR genes in strong linkage disequilibrium were found significantly associated with HL. Refined haplotype analysis showed that the association was supported by a dominant protective effect of KIR3DS1 and/or KIR2DS1, both of which are activating receptors. The odds ratios for developing HL in subjects with at least one copy of KIR3DS1 or KIR2DS1 with respect to subjects with neither of these genes were 0.44[95% confidence interval 0.23-0.85] and 0.42[0.21-0.85], respectively. No significant association was found in a tentative replication case/control study of 68 HL cases (age 18-71 years). In the familial study, the protective effect of KIR3DS1/KIR2DS1 tended to be stronger in HL patients with detectable EBV in blood or tumour cells.This work defines a template for family-based association studies based on full genotypic information for the KIR cluster, and provides the first evidence that activating KIRs can have a protective role in HL."
https://openalex.org/W2023270000,"Background Many people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) suffer from stigma and discrimination. There is an ongoing debate, however, about whether stigma, fear and discrimination actually fuel the persisting spread of HIV, or slow it down by reducing contacts between the whole population and high-risk minorities. To contribute to this debate, we analysed the relationship between perceived discrimination and unsafe sex in a large sample of French PLWHAs. Methodology/Principal Findings In 2003, we conducted a national cross-sectional survey among a random sample of HIV-infected patients. The analysis was restricted to sexually active respondents (N = 2,136). Unsafe sex was defined as sexual intercourse without a condom with a seronegative/unknown serostatus partner during the prior 12 months. Separate analyses were performed for each transmission group (injecting drug use (IDU), homosexual contact, heterosexual contact). Overall, 24% of respondents reported experiences of discrimination in their close social environment (relatives, friends and colleagues) and 18% reported unsafe sex during the previous 12 months. Both prevalences were higher in the IDU group (32% for perceived discrimination, 23% for unsafe sex). In multivariate analyses, experience of discrimination in the close social environment was associated with an increase in unsafe sex for both PLWHAs infected through IDU and heterosexual contact (OR = 1.65 and 1.80 respectively). Conclusions Our study clearly confirms a relationship between discrimination and unsafe sex among PLWHAs infected through either IDU or heterosexual contact. This relationship was especially strong in the heterosexual group that has become the main vector of HIV transmission in France, and who is the more likely of sexual mixing with the general population. These results seriously question the hypothesis that HIV-stigma has no effect or could even reduce the infection spread of HIV."
https://openalex.org/W1997637119,"Circadian rhythms in living organisms have long been attributed solely to a transcription-translation loop comprising a negative or positive feedback. The rhythms in cyanobacteria are known to be modulated by kaiC, kaiA and kaiB genes. It was recently shown, however, that their product proteins KaiC, KaiA and KaiB are sufficient to reconstitute the circadian rhythm in the phosphorylation level of KaiC in vitro. It has since been unclear why such an oscillatory behavior can occur in the absence of the apparent transcription-translation feedback. In the meantime, it has been reported that the monomer exchange between KaiC hexamers occurs in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, which suggests that the monomer shuffling is also involved in the circadian rhythm (H. Kageyama et al., Mol. Cell, 23, 161 (2006)). To further clarify the role of the monomer shuffling, we have performed a computational modeling of interactions among Kai proteins assuming the allosteric transition of KaiC hexamer as well as the monomer shuffling. The results show that the existence of both monomer shuffling and allosteric transition can synchronize the phosphorylation level of the KaiC hexamers, and stabilizes its oscillation."

Astrocytes produce large amounts of brain cholesterol and produce and release lipoproteins containing apoE that can extract cholesterol from CNS cells for elimination. We hypothesized that some of the deleterious effects of ethanol in the developing brain may be due to the disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in astrocytes. This study investigates the effect of ethanol on cholesterol efflux mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) cholesterol transporters. In fetal rat astrocytes in culture, ethanol caused a concentration-dependent increase in cholesterol efflux and increased the levels of ABCA1 starting at 25 mm. Similar effects of ethanol on cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 were also observed in fetal human astrocytes. In addition, ABCA1 levels were increased in the brains of 7-day-old pups treated for 3 days with 2, 4, or 6 g/kg ethanol. Ethanol also increased apoE release from fetal rat astrocytes, and conditioned medium prepared from ethanol-treated astrocytes extracted more cholesterol than conditioned medium from untreated cells. In addition, ethanol increased the levels of another cholesterol transporter, ABCG1.

Major producers of cholesterol in the brain are glial cells, namely oligodendrocytes, which immobilize it into the myelin, microglia, and astrocytes. Astrocytes also produce and release apolipoprotein E (apoE)-containing high density lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles that can extract cholesterol from CNS cells (28LaDu M.J. Gilligan S.M. Lukens J.R.

The first step in lipoprotein formation consists in cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from cells to apolipoproteins; this is mediated by members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, namely ABCA1, ABCG1, and ABCG4. During HDL formation in the plasma, ABCA1 is required for transferring phospholipids and/or cholesterol to lipid-free or lipid-poor apoAI or apoE (29Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Physiol.

In astrocytes, ABCA1 and ABCG1 have been implicated in cholesterol efflux to lipid-poor apolipoproteins and HDL and in lipoprotein formation (32Abildayeva K. Jansen P.J. Hirsch-Reinshagen V.

ABCA1 has been involved in regulating apoE release; indeed, in astrocytes derived from ABCA1 null mice, cholesterol accumulates intracellularly as its efflux is inhibited, apoE secretion is reduced, and lipoprotein particles contain less cholesterol and apoE and are smaller than those present in wild type astrocytes (33Hirsch-Reinshagen V.

Neurons also express ABCA1 and ABCG1 cholesterol transporters that induce cholesterol efflux to lipid-poor apolipoproteins and apoE discs (36Kim W.S. Suryo Rahmanto A. Kamili A. Rye K.A.

Based on the observed similarities between FAS and SLOS, we hypothesized that ethanol may affect cholesterol homeostasis in the developing brain and that such an effect may contribute to FAS (38Guizzetti M. Costa L.G. Med. Hypotheses. 2005; 64: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We found that ethanol increased the levels of the cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 and cholesterol efflux in fetal rat and human astrocytes, thus decreasing cholesterol levels. Rat Astrocyte Cultures—Primary cultures of cortical astrocytes, prepared from fetuses at gestational day 21 as previously described (39Guizzetti M. Costa P. Peters J. Costa L.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 297: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), low glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Nine days after preparation, astrocytes were harvested and plated for experiments. For cholesterol efflux and cholesterol synthesis experiments, cells were seeded in 24-well plates; for all other experiments, cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes. 48 or 24 h before all experiments (except for cholesterol efflux experiments) cells were shifted to the same medium without serum, supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA); all treatments were carried out in serum-free DMEM/BSA medium. Human Astrocyte Cultures—For preparation of fetal human astrocytes, tissue was provided by the Birth Defects Research Laboratories of the University of Washington, and the experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the institution. Mixed cultures were prepared from brains of legally aborted human fetuses (12–15 weeks of gestation) as previously described (40Yagle K. Lu H. Guizzetti M. Moller T. Costa L.G. Glia. 2001; 35: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cholesterol Efflux—Cholesterol efflux was measured as previously described (41Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Briefly, astrocytes were labeled for 24 h with 1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in growth medium. Cells were then incubated for 24 h in serum-free DMEM/BSA with ethanol (25–100 mm), 0.3 mm 8-Br-cAMP, or 10 μm 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22(R)-HC) plus 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), and then chased for 5–6 h in fresh DMEM/BSA in the presence or in the absence of the cholesterol acceptors apoA1, apoE, and HDL (purchased from Calbiochem) or astrocyte-conditioned medium (prepared by incubating separate astrocyte cultures in serum-free DMEM, 0.1% BSA for 48 h). The medium was collected and centrifuged to remove detached cells, and [3H]cholesterol content in the medium and in the cellular lipids, extracted in hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v), was measured using a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6000SC). Cholesterol efflux was expressed as a percentage of total cholesterol. Western Blot Analyses—At the end of each incubation, cells were scraped in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm sodium orthovanadate) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), as previously described (42Guizzetti M. Costa L.G. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 1639-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Samples were sonicated, rocked for 40 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. Intracellular proteins were quantified by the Bradford method, and 25 or 50 μg of proteins were loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE to detect ABCA1, ABCG1, and ABCG4. To detect secreted apoE levels, 30 μl of medium were loaded on a 4–10% gel. After separation, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA); labeled with polyclonal antibodies against ABCA1 (Chemicon, Tamecula, CA), ABCG1, ABCG4 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or ApoE (Biodesign International, Saco, Maine) followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG; and detected by chemiluminescence. Membranes from cytosolic extracts were reprobed for β-actin, whereas membranes from medium-derived proteins were reprobed for biglycan, a proteoglycan secreted by astrocytes whose release is not affected by ethanol, 3N. H. Moore, M. Guizzetti, and C. G. Costa, unpublished observation. to ensure equal loading. Animal Treatments and Tissue Preparation—Time-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Hollister, CA) were housed in individual cages with free access to food (Harlan 8604, Madison, WI) and water and were on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. The day of birth was considered postnatal day (PND) 0 for the pups. Each litter was adjusted within 3 days to eight pups, and rats were housed with their dams until weaning (PND 21). For measurement of developmental changes, 4–6 pups were sacrificed on PNDs 1, 4, 7, 10, 15, 21, and 60. For ethanol treatments, pups were matched by weight between treatment groups and controls. Ethanol was diluted to 20% (w/v) in water and was administered by intragastric intubation at the dose of 2, 4, or 6 g/kg of body weight, as described previously (43Tsuji R. Guizzetti M. Costa L.G. Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 1395-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Each dose was divided into two equal doses given 3 h apart. A control group received a 11.4% sucrose solution. During treatments, pups were separated from their dams for 3 h and kept under a heating lamp. Animals were treated with ethanol or sucrose from postnatal day 4 to day 7 and were sacrificed 45 min after the second dose of PND 7. Cerebral cortices were removed, placed in lysis buffer supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture, sonicated, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Proteins were quantified and analyzed by Western blot. Biotinylation of Surface Proteins and Immunoprecipitation—For selective labeling of plasma membrane proteins, astrocytes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with PBS containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) as previously described (41Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Cells were then solubilized in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors and proteins were quantified. In one set of experiments, cell lysates were incubated with a polyclonal antibody to ABCA1 for 1 h at 4 °C under constant mixing by inversion. 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) were then added to the mixture at 4 °C overnight. After several washes, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The total ABCA1 and the biotinylated ABCA1 were detected using an ABCA1 polyclonal antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, respectively. In another set of experiments, cell lysates were incubated with 200 μl of streptavidin beads (Pierce) and mixed by inversion at 4 °C for 1 h. The precipitated proteins were washed several times, pelleted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Biotinylated ABCA1 was detected with the polyclonal ABCA1 antibody. RNA Extraction and Real Time PCR Analysis—RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the directions of the manufacturer. Total RNA and its purity were quantified by spectrophotometry. Electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels was used to ensure good mRNA integrity. Levels of mRNA were determined by real time PCR by the DNA Sequencing and Gene Analysis Center (Department of Pharmaceutics, University of Washington) using TaqMan® reverse transcription kits and an ABI 7900 HS Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). β-Actin was used as reference gene in all of the experiments, since preliminary observations demonstrated that β-actin expression is not affected by ethanol treatments. Cholesterol Synthesis—Cholesterol synthesis was measured as previously described (44Lusa S. Heino S. Ikonen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19844-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with some modifications. After 24 h in serum-free medium, astroctytes were labeled with 25 μCi/ml [3H]acetate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h, followed by a 24-h incubation in the presence or in the absence of 75 mm ethanol. Lipids were then extracted in hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v); after evaporation, the organic phase was dissolved again in 55 μl of chloroform. 5 μl of each sample were counted on a scintillation counter to determine the total 3H radioactivity incorporated into cell lipids, whereas 50 μl were spotted on activated silica gel TLC plates (Macherey-Nagel Inc., Easton, PA) and developed in hexane/diethyl ether/methanol/acetic acid (120:30:10:1.5). The plates were allowed to dry and stained with iodine vapor. The cholesterol and cholesterol ester bands, determined by the co-migration of cholesterol and cholesterol oleate standards, were excised from the plates, and the associated radioactivity was quantified. The cholesterol synthesized and released in the medium during the 24-h incubation was also quantified: the medium was collected and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to remove any cells, and lipids were extracted in hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v) and analyzed by TLC as described above. The relative rate of cholesterol synthesis was expressed as the sum of the counts/min associated with intracellular and medium cholesterol divided by the 3H radioactivity associated with the total lipid mixture. Measurement of Cholesterol Mass—At the end of astrocyte incubation, total cholesterol was extracted with hexane/propanol (3:2, v/v). The solvent was subsequently evaporated, and the lipids were resuspended in 1.5% Triton X-100. Cholesterol was measured by an enzymatic method using the cholesterol kit Amplex Red cholesterol assay (Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) according to the direction of the manufacturer, and read with a fluorescence microplate reader (563-nm absorbance and 587-nm emission). Incubations with Ethanol—In order to reduce ethanol evaporation, cultures were treated as previously described (40Yagle K. Lu H. Guizzetti M. Moller T. Costa L.G. Glia. 2001; 35: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 45Guizzetti M. Catlin M. Costa L.G. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: e93-e98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some ethanol experiments, cultures were placed in sealed chambers (Billups-Rothenberg Inc.) together with a reservoir tray containing an ethanol solution at the same concentration as the ethanol in the culture medium. Control cultures were placed in identical chambers in which the reservoir tray contained only water. Ethanol concentrations were determined at the beginning and at the end of some experiments in vitro and in the blood of ethanol-fed pups by an enzymatic method using a Roche Applied Science/R-Biopharm kit. Ethanol losses were usually maintained below 15% after 24-h incubations and 20% after 48-h incubations. Statistical Analysis—All statistical tests were carried out using a Kaleidagraph 4.0 software on a Macintosh personal computer. One-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significance difference (LDS) test were used to determine significant (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, or p < 0.001, as indicated) differences from controls. To determine the effect of ethanol on cholesterol efflux from fetal rat astrocytes, [3H]cholesterol-labeled cells were incubated with 25–100 mm ethanol for 24 h. Cholesterol efflux was measured during the subsequent 6-h incubations in the absence (Fig. 1A) and in the presence of HDL, apoA1, or astrocyte-conditioned medium as cholesterol acceptors (Fig. 1B). The rationale for using conditioned medium as a cholesterol acceptor lies in the fact that astrocytes release HDL-like particles containing apoE (28LaDu M.J. Gilligan S.M. Lukens J.R. Cabana V.G. Reardon C.A. Van Eldik L.J. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2070-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 46Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Foss D. Mahley R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 917: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar); indeed, we found that, under the described conditions, medium conditioned for 48 h by separate astrocyte cultures induced cholesterol release (Fig. 1B). Ethanol, starting at 25 mm, induced a dose-dependent increase in cholesterol release from astrocytes in the absence of acceptors (Fig. 1A) and enhanced the efflux mediated by apoA1, HDL, and conditioned medium (Fig. 1B). This effect was not due to increased permeability to cholesterol of the plasma membrane by residual ethanol, since the presence of 100 mm ethanol during cholesterol efflux measurement did not affect cholesterol release (Fig. 1C). The cholesterol transporter ABCA1 plays a pivotal role in cholesterol efflux in many cell types, including astrocytes. Ethanol increased the levels of ABCA1 protein, measured in whole cell lysate, in a concentration-dependent manner starting at 25 mm (Fig. 2A). To verify that levels of active ABCA1 were increased, we measured the levels of ABCA1 in the plasma membrane, where it can directly interact with apolipoproteins for cholesterol removal (29Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1343-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). After biotinylation of membrane proteins, ABCA1 was immunoprecipitated and detected by streptavidin chemiluminescence. As shown in Fig. 2B, ethanol increased levels of biotinylated ABCA1. Similar results were obtained by immunoprecipitating all biotinylated proteins and measuring ABCA1 with a polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2C). It should be noted that we and others (37Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Ikonomovic M.D. Skoko J. Lefterov P.I. Isanski B.A. DeKosky S.T. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13244-13256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) detected multiple bands by immunoblot, suggesting the presence of post-translational modifications or different isoforms of ABCA1 in these cells. We also assessed whether ethanol increased ABCA1 transcription by real time PCR quantification of ABCA1 mRNA. In time course experiments, we observed a significant increase in ABCA1 mRNA after 18-, 24-, and 32-h incubation with 100 mm ethanol (Fig. 3A); concentration-response experiments showed a small ABCA1 mRNA induction by ethanol at lower ethanol concentrations (Fig. 3B). By comparison, treatment of astrocytes with the nuclear liver X receptor agonist 22(R)-HC plus the retinoid X receptor agonist 9-cis-RA, known to induce ABCA1 expression in these cells (37Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Ikonomovic M.D. Skoko J. Lefterov P.I. Isanski B.A. DeKosky S.T. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13244-13256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), induced a robust and rapid increase in ABCA1 mRNA (Fig. 3C). These finding suggest that, although ethanol may affect ABCA1 transcription, additional mechanisms should also be involved in ethanol-induced increase of ABCA1.FIGURE 3Effect of ethanol and 22(R)-HC/9-cis-RA on ABCA1 mRNA levels. Astrocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 mm ethanol for different times (A) for 24 h in the presence or absence of different concentrations of ethanol (B) or for different times in the presence of 10 μm 22(R)-HC and 10 μm 9-cis-RA (C).

Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35896-35903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and that ethanol, starting at 25 mm, inhibits PLD signaling in astrocytes (48Guizzetti M. Thompson B.D. Kim Y. VanDeMark K. Costa L.G. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that PLD2 is indeed the main isoform present in cortical primary astrocytes, whereas PLD1 is hardly detected. We investigated the involvement of PLD in the up-regulation of ABCA1 by incubating astrocytes with a short chain primary alcohol (1-butanol), which, like ethanol, is an inhibitor of PLD signaling, and its analogue tertiary alcohol (tert-butanol). Short chain alcohols, including ethanol and 1-butanol, are competitive substrates for a PLD-catalyzed transphosphatidylation reaction, leading to the formation of phosphatidylethanol or phosphatidylbutanol instead of phosphatidic acid, thereby inhibiting PLD signaling. Short chain secondary and tertiary alcohols (such as tert-butanol) have been used as “inactive analogues,” since they are not PLD substrates. We found that 1-butanol, but not tert-butanol, increased ABCA1 protein levels (Fig. 4B); the relative optical density of ABCA1 bands in 1-butanol- and tert-butanol-treated astrocytes were (-fold increase versus control) 1.97 ± 0.2 and 0.98 ± 0.09, respectively, indicating that, indeed, inhibition of PLD signaling induces ABCA1 up-regulation in astrocytes. To substantiate our results with ethanol on ABCA1 levels and on cholesterol efflux, we tested whether up-regulation of ABCA1 by 8-Br-cAMP, a cAMP analogue that induces ABCA1 and cholesterol efflux in other cell types (29Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1343-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), or by 22(R)-HC/9-cis-RA, would also increase cholesterol efflux. Both treatments increased apoAI- and HDL-mediated c"

The phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems (PTS) 2The abbreviations used are: PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system; EI, enzyme I; EII, enzyme II; Km, kanamycin; TEMED, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine. are among the most widespread protein phosphorylation setups in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The PTS systems generally participate in the uptake of sugars into the cells by means of a cascade of high energy phosphate transfer (1Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Deutscher J. Francke C. Postma P.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 939-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). As shown schematically in Fig. 1A, the archetypal PTS system consists of enzyme I (EI), HPr, and enzyme II (EII). Due to their ability to interact with other proteins in the cytoplasm, the set of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated PTS proteins (more often HPr and EIIA) fulfills regulatory functions as diverse as catabolite repression, chemotaxis, the regulation of cyclic AMP synthesis, or nitrogen assimilation (2Deutscher J.

Rev. 2005; 69: 608-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Apart from these PTS components involved in sugar transport, many prokaryotes also have PTS branches that are not involved in carbohydrate traffic. This is because their EII component fails to have the permease partners (the so-called EIIB and EIIC domains) needed for sugar intake. However, such proteins still participate in regulation of some processes in a fashion dependent on their phosphorylation state. The PtsN protein of Pseudomonas putida (Fig. 1B) is one example of this case (5Kohler T. Alvarez J.F. Harayama S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 115: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 6Cases I. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol.

This product is hypothesized to play a role in N-metabolism because of the clustering of the ptsN gene with rpoN, which encodes the alternative, nitrogen-related sigma factor σ54 (3Powell B.S.

Sequence comparison with other IIANtr proteins revealed that PtsN can most likely be phosphorylated on the His68 residue (6Cases I. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol.

The principal m-xylene-responsive σ54-dependent promotor of this system (called Pu) is regulated not only by the presence of pathway substrates but also subject to different physiological inputs that cause its down-regulation in vivo (6Cases I.

Specifically, glucose and other carbohydrates of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway repress transcription from Pu (14Velazquez F. di Bartolo I. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8267-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) through a mechanism that involves the phosphorylation of the His68 residue of PtsN. The course of the phosphotransfer in the process or the origin and fate of the high energy phosphate that passes through PtsN in vivo is, however, difficult to assess. This is because phospho-histidines are labile in any of the procedures that allow detection of other phospho-amino acids (15Lasker M. Bui C.D. Besant P.G. Sugawara K. Thai P. Medzihradszky G. Turck C.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Klumpp S. Krieglstein J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1067-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To overcome this difficulty, we have resorted to the release of much of the intact proteome of live P. putida cells directly into a native polyacrylamide gel 3K. Pflüger, I. di Bartolo, F. Velázquez, and V. de Lorenzo, submitted for publication. by means of the in situ electrophoresis of whole bacteria. With this experimental setup in hand, we were able to examine the phosphorylation state of PtsN of P. putida through various growth stages and distinct nutrient conditions. These included media with fructose (a PTS sugar in P. putida (18Velazquez F. Pflüger K. Cases I. De Eugenio L.I. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)) or glucose (a non-PTS sugar (18Velazquez F. Pflüger K. Cases I. De Eugenio L.I. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar)), along with casamino acids, ammonia, or nitrate as N-sources. The data presented below revealed that the phosphorylated form of PtsN systematically accumulates along growth regardless of the composition of the culture medium. Furthermore, our results suggest that the P-free form of PtsN is the one with a superior regulatory capacity. Strains, Plasmid, and Growth Conditions—All Pseudomonas strains used in this work were derived from strain P. putida MAD2, a derivative of the reference strain P. putida KT2440 (19Fernandez S. de Lorenzo V. Perez-Martin J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The P. putida MAD2 variants bearing directed chromosomal insertions of gene ptsN, with either a kanamycin (Km) resistance gene or the xylE marker, have been described before (6Cases I. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15562-15568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Cases I. Velazquez F. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5128-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Plasmid pVLTptsN tag, encoding a variant of the ptsN gene with a short E-tag epitope added in its C terminus, was constructed as follows. First, the ptsN sequence was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides F154SD (5′-CGGAATTCAGGAGATAGAATGATCCGACTTGAAACCATC-3′) and RptsNtag-5′ (5′-GCTCTAGAT CACGCGGCACGCGGTTCCAGCGGATCCGGATACGGCACCGGCGCACCTCCGTGCTCGTTCTGTACGTCCAGG-3′). The product of such amplification bore an EcoRI restriction site (underlined) and a ribosome binding site (bold) at the 5′-end of the ptsN gene sequence, as well as a downstream sequence encoding the E-tag (bold) followed by an extra XbaI restriction site (underlined). The resulting DNA was subsequently ligated to the polylinker of pVLT31 (20de Lorenzo V. Eltis L. Kessler B. Timmis K.N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) as an EcoRI-XbaI fragment, and the ligation rescued in E. coli DH5α cells to yield the plasmid of interest, pVLTptsN tag. Plasmid pVLTptsNHA_E, encoding an E-tagged ptsN variant bearing an H68A change in its primary amino acid sequence, was constructed in an analogous manner using plasmid pJMT/154-H68A (6Cases I. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15562-15568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as the PCR template. These plasmids were transferred by conjugation to the P. putida strains indicated, in each case using E. coli HB101 (RK600) as the helper of a triparental mating procedure (21de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The P. putida strain bearing a chromosomally encoded E-tagged version of PtsN that otherwise keeps its native promoter and stoichiometry was constructed as follows. The 362-bp XmaI/XbaI fragment of pVLTptsN tag, encoding the C-terminal part of the protein fused to the E-tag, was recloned in the λpir-dependent replication vector pJP5603, which has a Km resistance cassette and an oriT origin of transfer for RP4-mediated mobilization (22Penfold R.J. Pemberton J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid pJPptsNΔN was subsequently passed from E. coli CC118 λpir into P. putida by conjugation to promote formation of co-integrates by homologous recombination between the chromosomal ptsN gene and the plasmid bearing the truncated ′ptsN E-tag segment (see “Results”). Km-resistant P. putida exconjugants were examined by PCR for integration of pJPptsNΔN into the chromosome by a single DNA crossover event between the homologous sequences. One clone fulfilling all criteria was then kept for further analysis. Unless indicated otherwise, cells were grown at 30 °C in either rich LB medium or synthetic mineral M9 medium (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, 1989Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids and 5 μg/ml tetracycline or 50 μg/ml kanamycin, in the presence or absence of 0.2% glucose or fructose. To analyze the influence of the N-source, cells were grown in nitrogen-free M9 medium supplemented with either 10 mm NH4Cl or 2 mm NaNO3. For induction of ptsN expression born by plasmids pVLTptsN tag and pVLTptsNHA_E, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the cultures to a final concentration of 1 mm. Sample Preparation and Processing—To obtain samples for analysis in the native PAGE system,3 cells were grown in the media indicated, amended where required with suitable antibiotics and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation (2 min, 14,000 rpm, 4 °C) at the time points indicated, and the pellets were resuspended in a non-denaturing loading buffer (10% glycerol, 40 mm glycine, 5 mm Tris, pH 8.9, and 0.005% w/v bromphenol blue) such that a cell mass equivalent of 1 ml of culture at an A600 = 1.0 was adjusted to disperse in 200 μl of the loading buffer. 10 μl of such intact cell suspensions were directly loaded into the wells of the non-denaturing gel system described below. Where required, protein specimens were stored at –20 °C until use (never longer than 1 week). Native and Denaturing PAGE and Western Blotting—The non-denaturing gel electrophoresis system employed throughout this work is explained elsewhere.3 In brief, the gels consisted of a 10% polyacrylamide (10% (v/v) acrylamide/bis-acrylamide solution (29:1) polymerized with 0.05% (v/v)TEMED and 0.05% ammonium persulfate in 1× running buffer (200 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.9) and were assembled in a mini-Protean gel box (Bio-Rad). 10 μl of the protein samples prepared as described above and adjusted to contain equivalent cell numbers were loaded in each well, and electrophoresis was carried out with a fixed current of 12.5 mA/gel (8.5 × 6.5 cm, width × height) at 4 °C for 35 min. The proteins were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) as described (24Jurado P. Ritz D. Beckwith J. de Lorenzo V. Fernandez L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The anti-E-tag monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) was applied for luminescent detection of the PtsN-E-tag fusion proteins with the procedure described (24Jurado P. Ritz D. Beckwith J. de Lorenzo V. Fernandez L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce Biotechnology) system was employed for detection of chromosomally encoded E-tagged ptsN, according to the supplier's manual. The intensity of the PtsN bands was quantified in a molecular imager Versadoc 4000 (Bio-Rad) with the Quantity One software. PtsN Occurs in Vivo as Two Protein Species Differing by Phosphorylation of His68—The first step for examining the effect of various physiological conditions on the phosphorylation state of PtsN was to authenticate the protein forms that are released from P. putida cells upon in situ electrophoresis.3 To this end, we employed an epitope-containing variant of the PtsN protein fused to an E-tag sequence so that we could accurately follow its presence in various types of samples. As shown in Fig. 2, the PtsN protein freed from live P. putida ptsN::Km (pVLTptsN tag) cells grown in LB separated into two bands (lane 3) in the native gel system, possibly reflecting the phosphorylated and the non-phosphorylated forms. Unfortunately, neither are P ∼ His bonds good substrates for commercially available phosphatases that act well on P ∼ Ser and P ∼ Tyr, nor do reliable procedures exist yet for analyzing P ∼ His peptides by mass spectrometry. We thus chose a genetic procedure for recognizing phosphorylation of PtsN and for tracing it to a distinct position within the amino acid sequence of the protein. This consisted of examining the gel migration properties of a PtsN variant in which the conserved His68 residue, that is, the substrate of phosphorylation by cognate kinases, has been exchanged by an Ala and is thus locked in a non-phosphorylated form. P. putida cells bearing pVLTptsNHA_E were subject to the same treatment as before and examined in the non-denaturing system. The data of Fig. 2 show that such an H68A variant produces one band that migrates to the same position as the slower-migrating protein of the wild-type PtsN but lacks the faster-migrating form (the extra E-tagged PtsN H68A band observed in lane 2 might be a complex of PtsN with another cytoplasmic protein). This unambiguously verified that PtsN of P. putida exists in vivo in two forms, which differ in the phosphorylation state of residue His68. Visualizing PtsN ∼ P Evolution along Growth—Once we had in hand a reliable procedure for detecting the two forms of PtsN derived from live cells, we set out to examine the ratio between them under various growth conditions. As a first approach, we opted for monitoring the evolution of PtsN species in cells growing in rich LB medium, bearing an E-tagged version of the protein expressed from its native promoter in monocopy gene dosage. This was based on the use of one P. putida strain in which the E-tag had been added to the genomic sequence of ptsN by a single-crossover homologous recombination with plasmid pJPptsNΔN (Fig. 3A). This strain was grown in LB, samples were taken at the transition between exponential and stationary phase (Fig. 3B), and cells were analyzed in the native PAGE system explained above. Production of the two PtsN forms could be clearly visualized (Fig. 3C, upper panel), thereby revealing two valuable details. First, it revealed that the onset of the stationary phase was accompanied by the prevalence of the phosphorylated form of PtsN. Second, it revealed that the total level of the PtsN product appeared to decline, in any case, as growth proceeded into the late stationary phase. Due to the intrinsic production of PtsN at relatively low levels in vivo, the signals from the chromosomally encoded, E-tagged product in the Western blot were quite weak, almost at the detection limit of the procedure. A super-sensitive detection system and longer exposure times had to be used for identification of the bands (see “Materials and Methods”). To overcome this limitation, we resorted to expressing the same protein from plasmid pVLTptsN tag for both raising the level of intracellular protein and uncoupling expression from its native promoter. To ensure that this change still reflected the physiological scenario, we followed the evolution of PtsN in P. putida ptsN::Km (pVLTptsN tag) cells grown in LB under the same conditions of the chromosomally ptsN-tagged P. putida strain. The result (Fig. 3C, lower panel) reproduced dependably the behavior of the chromosomal ptsN-tagged strain (including the sharp decrease of PtsN signals at late stationary phase). Moreover, quantification of the products was facilitated by a higher expression of the proteins, and deviations between experiments decreased. All this endorsed P. putida ptsN::Km (pVLTptsN tag) as a strain of choice for examining the relative ratio of PtsN species in connection to the presence of diverse C-sources or N-sources in the medium. PtsN ∼ P Accumulates with Growth Regardless of the Culture Medium—As the phosphorylation state of PtsN is an indicator of the passage of high energy phosphate between the components of the abridged PTS system sketched in Fig. 1B, the procedure and the strain P. putida ptsN::Km (pVLTptsN tag) presented above were instrumental to follow the evolution of the relative PtsN/PtsN ∼ P ratio along growth in the following media: (i) control, LB, excess of C-source and N-source; (ii) mineral medium with casamino acids (excess N-source) with either glucose (a non-PTS sugar in P. putida) or fructose (a PTS sugar); and (iii) mineral medium with glucose as C-source and either ammonium (an easily metabolizable N-source) or nitrate (a suboptimal N-source). It should be emphasized that the information pursued with such experiments was the relative ratio between PtsN and PtsN ∼ P, not the absolute amount of the PtsN protein, which decreases in any case during late stationary phase. As the proportion between the two PtsN forms depends exclusively of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation machinery, we assume that such a ratio grossly reflects the functioning of the corresponding PTS branch (see below). Figs. 4, 5, 6 show the accumulation of the two forms of PtsN under different growth settings. The first noticeable feature of all conditions is the systematic occurrence of a considerable level of the faster-migrating phosphorylated protein species, in contrast with the more variable non-phosphorylated form. Furthermore, in all cases, the predominant form of PtsN in the stationary phase is the phospho-containing species. On the contrary, the presence of the non-phosphorylated form varies significantly depending on the growth medium and the growth stage. For instance, Fig. 4 shows that there is a considerable amount of the non-phosphorylated PtsN in glucose-grown cells at a growth phase in which the same form has virtually disappeared from cells grown in the presence of fructose. In Fig. 5, the various ratios of PtsN/PtsN ∼ P species are shown as a function of growth phase. Although all of them shared the predominance of the phosphorylated form at late growth stages, the disappearance of the non-phosphorylated species seems to occur earlier in the fructose-grown cells. A different case is posed by varying the N-source from ammonia (NH+4) to nitrate (NO–3) in the culture (Fig. 6). This anion cannot be used as a terminal electron acceptor by P. putida as this bacterium lacks the key enzymes respiratory nitrate and nitrite reductase that would be required for such a function (25Weinel C. Nelson K.E. Tummler B. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Nelson K.E. Weinel C. Paulsen I.T. Dodson R.J. Hilbert H. Martins dos Santos V.A. Fouts D.E.

Microbiol. 2002; 4: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). However, NO–3 can be employed as a nitrogen source, through the action of assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductases, which convert nitrate into nitrite and then into metabolizable NH+4. The physiological change caused by NO–3 is, therefore, the replacement of an easy N-source by a less direct counterpart. The result shown in Fig. 6 suggests that the phosphorylated form of PtsN is virtually the only product observed with NO–3, whereas both forms can be detected in NH+4-grown bacteria. That the PtsN/PtsN ∼ P ratios can be changed by growth phase, C-source, and N-source suggests that the phosphorylation state of this protein is more a reflection of the metabolic status of the cells than a component of any specific sugar-traffic system.FIGURE 5Evolution of the share of non-phosphorylated PtsN in P. putida ptsN::Km (pVLTptsN tag). Cells were grown in the media indicated, and samples were collected at the times indicated by arrows. The relative contents of the two PtsN forms were then determined in live cells as before. The bar diagrams represent the average of at least three separate experiments. Note the important presence of non-phosphorylated PtsN in cells grown in casamino acids (CAA) and glucose as compared with bacteria grown in fructose. In either case, the non-phosphorylated PtsN forms virtually disappear during the late stationary phase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6Effect of nitrogen sources in the phosphorylation state of PtsN in P. putida ptsN::Km (pVLTptsN tag). Cells were grown at 30 °C in N-free M9 minimal medium and glucose, supplemented with either 10 mm ammonia (NH+4) or 2 mm nitrate (NO–3). Culture samples were collected at the late exponential (late exp, lanes 1 and 2, A600 of 0.8 for NH+4 or 0.3 for NO–3) and early stationary (early stat, lanes 3 and 4, A600 of 1.5 for NH+4 or 0.7 for NO–3) phase, and cells were subject to the standard analysis of the PtsN forms. Note that PtsN ∼ P is the only species that appears in cells growing in NO–3 as N-source.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The PTS system (components of which are encoded in almost every bacterial genome known (2Deutscher J. Francke C. Postma P.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 939-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar)) has evolved to provide a mechanism by which the activities of distinct sets of proteins are regulated epigenetically. This occurs by means of their interactions with the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of each of the canonical EI, HPr, and EII components and their variants (4Barabote R.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 608-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Similarly, the intensity of the flow of high energy phosphate between phosphoenolpyruvate and the terminal phosphate acceptor (sugar or otherwise) is translated in a given ratio of phosphorylated versus non-phosphorylated PTS proteins. In turn, such ratios between each protein form coordinately enhance or inhibit groups of otherwise unrelated functions. The intriguing side of what appears to be a separate branch of the PTS system (Fig. 1B) is that the protein encoded by ptsN (EIIANtr) lacks the membrane-associated permease moieties EIIB and EIIC that typically tie PTS proteins to sugar transport (4Barabote R.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 608-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). An early hint about the functions of such proteins was derived from the genetic association of ptsN (and the adjacent ptsO gene) to rpoN in several bacteria (3Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4822-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). rpoN encodes a major sigma factor (σ54) involved among many other functions (27Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 28Valls M. Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Ramos J.L. The Pseudomonads. II.

Microbiol. 2003; 5: 1281-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in nitrogen metabolism. The proposition thus was that these PTS genes could be related to sensing the N versus C balance (i.e. the excess of one nutrient source versus the other), through a thus far unknown mechanism. One useful clue in this direction is the recent observation that the P. putida EINtr, NPr, and EIINtr proteins act in concert to control the intracellular accumulation of polyhydroxylalkanoates, typical products of carbon overflow in respect to other essential nutrients, e.g. nitrogen (18Velazquez F. Pflüger K. Cases I. De Eugenio L.I. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The whole set of EINtr, NPr, and EIIANtr proteins of E. coli have been purified and shown in vitro to sustain a typical flow of high energy phosphate: phosphoenolpyruvate → EINtr → NPr → EIIANtr (3Powell B.S. Court D.L. Inada T. Nakamura Y. Michotey V. Cui X. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. J. Biol.

Stammers D.K. Saunders N.J. Owens R.J. BMC Struct. Biol. 2005; 5: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and its interactions in solution with NPr have been studied (33Wang G. Peterkofsky A. Keifer P.A. Li X. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1082-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). ptsN mutants of E. coli have been generated and subjected to a variety of phenotypic analyses. For instance, ptsN mutants are extremely sensitive to leucine-containing peptides (LCPs (34Lee C.R. Koo B.M. Cho S.H. Kim Y.J. Yoon M.J. Peterkofsky A. Seok Y.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)), a phenomenon that can be traced to the interaction of EIIANtr with the K+ transporter TrkA (35Lee C.R. Cho S.H. Yoon M.J. Peterkofsky A. Seok Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4124-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, growth of the ptsN mutant of E. coli is inhibited by several sugars and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates in a medium containing an amino acid or nucleoside base as a combined source of nitrogen and carbon (3Powell B.S.

Such an inhibition can be reverted by supplying ammonium salts, an indication that ptsN is indeed related to N-metabolism. ptsN mutants of P. putida change the sensitivity of the m-xylene-responsive σ54 promoter Pu to the presence of glucose in the medium (6Cases I.

Albar J.P. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). ptsN is also involved in the response of Pasteurella multocida to iron starvation (39Paustian M.L. May B.J. Cao D. Boley D. Kapur V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6714-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Finally, inactivation of ptsN in Rhizobium etli reduces growth on medium containing succinate, lessens production of melanin, and inhibits expression of the N-fixation gene nifH (40Michiels J. Van Soom T. D'Hooghe I. Dombrecht B. Benhassine T. de Wilde P. Vanderleyden J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these multiple observations, the phosphorylation state of PtsN in vivo or the physiological circumstances that alter such a state have not been examined before. Perusal of the results shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6 clearly indicated that, regardless of the culture conditions: (i) the phosphorylated form of PtsN is present in all growth stages; (ii) PtsN ∼ P accumulates in the later stationary phase; and (iii) the non-phosphorylated PtsN protein appears associated to rapid growth. Although the expression of the ptsN gene from a heterologous promoter of a plasmid does unbalance the native stoichiometry of the system, we have shown that our experimental setup reasonably reflects the physiological scenario, probably because equilibrium is reached in the phosphorylation of all the proteins of the PTS system. Although we detect phosphorylated PtsN in virtually all growth conditions, the non-phosphorylated form seems to be subject to growth-dependent variations. If so, the protein form with more regulatory significance should be the non-phosphorylated PtsN species, the one that clearly varies with the carbon source at the onset of stationary phase. This notion is consistent with the appearance of a slower-migrating band in non-denaturing gel analysis of an extract expressing the H68A variant of PtsN (Fig. 2, lane 2), which may consist of complexes between PtsN and other proteins. Moreover, our results show that the disappearance of the non-phosphorylated PtsN does not occur simultaneously in all cases. Instead, the decline of the P-less species seems to happen earlier in the presence of fructose than with glucose (Fig. 5) and earlier in the presence of nitrate (NO–3) than with ammonia (NH+4, Fig. 6). The regulatory significance of these differences is still unclear and deserves further studies. However, they do suggest that it is the physiological conditions of the bacteria and not so much the traffic of specific sugars (as it happens with the canonical PTS) that dictates the relative phosphorylation states of the PtsN protein and possibly of the other enzymes of the N-related PTS of P. putida.

https://openalex.org/W1964929330,"20S RNA narnavirus is a positive strand RNA virus found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The viral genome (2514 nucleotides) only encodes a single protein (p91), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and does not have capsid proteins to form intracellular virions. The genomic RNA has no 3′ poly(A) tail and perhaps no cap structure at the 5′-end; thus resembling an intermediate of mRNA degradation. The virus, however, escapes the host surveillance and replicates in the yeast cytoplasm persistently. The viral genome is not naked but exists in the form of a ribonucleoprotein complex with p91 in a 1:1 stoichiometry. Here we investigated interactions between p91 and the viral genome. Our results indicate that p91 directly or indirectly interacts with the RNA at the 5′- and 3′-end regions and to a lesser extent at a central part. The 3′-end site is identical to or overlaps with the 3′ cis signal for replication identified previously. The 5′-site is at the second stem loop structure from the 5′-end (nucleotides 72–104), and this structure also contains a cis signal for replication. Analysis of mutants in the structure revealed a tight correlation between replication and formation of complexes. These results highlight the importance of ribonucleoprotein complexes for the viral life cycle. We will discuss implications of these findings especially on how the virus escapes from mRNA degradation pathways and resides in the cytoplasm persistently despite the lack of a protective capsid. 20S RNA narnavirus is a positive strand RNA virus found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

A wide variety of viruses (DNA, RNA, and retroviruses) can establish persistent infections in the host (1Ahmed R. Chen I.S.Y. Persistent Viral Infections. John Wiley and Sons, New York1999Google Scholar). For long term infections, the virus must not only be invisible to immune surveillance but also replicate stably inside of the host cells. DNA viruses and retroviruses can integrate their DNA genomes into host chromosomes or keep their genomes in an episomal state and utilize the host machinery to replicate them in a cell cycle-dependent manner. RNA viruses, including hepatitis C virus, also can establish persistent infections. Although clinical aspects of their infection such as the host immune responses have extensively been studied, intracellular events leading to the maintenance and stable replication of the viral genome remain to be elucidated. 20S RNA narnavirus is a persistent positive strand RNA virus found in most laboratory strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Wickner R.B.

The small and simple genome (2514 nucleotides (nt) 2The abbreviation used is: nt, nucleotides. ) that encodes a single 91-kDa protein (p91), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (4Matsumoto Y.

Especially the absence of intracellular virions makes it easier to analyze the viral RNA inside of the cell. Replication proceeds from genomic to antigenomic to genomic strands. The amount of antigenomic strands counts less than a few percent compared with that of the genomic strands. W double-stranded RNA (7Wesolowski M. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1984; 4: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a double-stranded form of the 20S RNA genome, is present in virus-harboring cells and is a byproduct of replication (8Fujimura T. Solórzano A. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7398-7406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells with vegetative growth contain a low amount of 20S RNA virus. Transferring them to nitrogen-starvation conditions, a common procedure to induce sporulation in diploid cells, increases the copy number of viral RNA to almost equivalent to those of rRNAs (9Kadowaki K. Halvorson H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 826-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wejksnora P.J. Haber J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 246-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increase in viral load may contribute to the efficient distribution of the virus to meiotic segregants. The reading frame for p91 spans almost the entire length of the genome, with only 12 nt at both ends as non-coding regions. 20S RNA has 5-nt inverted repeats at both termini (5′-GGGGC...GCCCC-OH) (6Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It lacks a poly(A) tail at the 3′-end and has perhaps no cap structure at the 5′-end, thus resembling an intermediate of the mRNA degradation pathway. 20S RNA is not encapsidated into proteinous or membranous structures and it migrates in sucrose gradients almost as naked RNA (11Widner W.R. Matsumoto Y. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20084-20089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It thus appears that the viral genome would be vulnerable to the exonucleases involved in mRNA degradation. 20S RNA virus, however, resides and replicates stably in the cytoplasm (13Solórzano A. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26428-26435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When antibodies against the RNA polymerase became available, it was found that p91 is associated with the viral genome (12García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20084-20089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that most (if not all) of the genomic strands exist in the form of ribonucleoprotein complexes with p91 in a 1:1 stoichiometry (13Solórzano A. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26428-26435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that formation of these complexes is a key factor for the stabilization of the viral genome inside of the cell. In this work we investigate the interactions of p91 with the viral RNA in ribonucleoprotein complexes. Our results indicate that p91 interacts with the genomic strand at the 5′- and 3′-end regions and also weakly at the central part. Mutations at the 5′- and 3′-sites that impaired formation of complexes in vivo also abolished replication, indicating the importance of formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes in the viral life cycle. We will discuss possible roles of these complexes, especially on the stability of the viral genome during 20S RNA persistent infection. Immunoprecipitation of RNase-treated 20S RNA/p91 Complexes—Ribonucleoprotein complexes of 20S RNA virus were isolated from strain 37-4C (a kar1-1 leu1 20S RNA, 23S RNA, L-A-o, L-BC-o) (7Wesolowski M.

The reaction mixture was kept at 4 °C for 30 min. 50 μl (wet volume) of protein A-conjugated Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the mixture, and it was incubated at 4 °C for another 30 min. The Sepharose was washed four times with 1 ml of TBST and suspended in 200 μl of 5 mm EDTA and 0.5% SDS. The RNA bound to Sepharose was extracted with phenol, phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of 50% dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 m glyoxal, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and incubated at 50 °C for 1 h. The solution was diluted with 1 ml of 10× SSC and divided into aliquots. Each aliquot was blotted onto a Nytran N membrane (Schleicher and Schüell) using a Bio-Dot SF apparatus (Bio-Rad). RNA on the membranes was detected by hybridization using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase run-off transcripts as described in Ref. 15Fujimura T. Esteban R. Esteban L.M. Wickner R.B.

Cells (3 × 108) were broken with glass beads by vortex mixing. After removing the cell debris and unbroken cells, lysates were incubated with anti-p91 antiserum or its preimmune serum and immunocomplexes were isolated with protein A-conjugated Sepharose CL-4B. The RNA pulled-down was extracted and slot-blotted onto a Nytran N membrane, and 20S RNA transcripts on the membrane were detected by hybridization. Quantification of band intensities was done with a phosphorimager. Throughout this work we used T3 run-off transcripts from SmaI-digested pALI-18 (18Esteban R. Vega L. Fujimura T. J. Biol.

The probe contains the entire 20S RNA antigenomic strand sequence. RNA was also extracted directly from the lysates (Total RNA), slot-blotted, and hybridized with either the 20S RNA-specific probe or the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide RE368 (5′-CCTCATAAAACTGATACGAGCTTCTGCTATCC-3′) complementary to nt 963–994 in 25S rRNA. The latter was used to detect 25S rRNA as a loading control. In Vitro Mutagenesis—Site-directed in vitro mutagenesis was done as described (20Esteban R. Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All mutations introduced were confirmed by DNA sequencing. p91 Interacts with the 20S RNA Viral Genome at Three Sites—20S RNA forms ribonucleoprotein complexes with p91. These complexes, partially purified through a sucrose gradient, can be specifically immunoprecipitated with anti-p91 antiserum and intact 20S RNA molecules can be recovered in the precipitates (Fig. 1A). We wished to determine the p91 binding site(s) on the RNA. For this, complexes were first treated with various amounts of RNase A and then immunoprecipitated with anti-p91 antiserum. RNA fragments pulled down by the antibodies were analyzed by Northern blots using different RNA probes. We made nine sets of blots, and each membrane was hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe that recognized a different part of the 20S RNA molecule (Fig. 1C). After treatment with the highest concentration of RNase A, the 5′- and 3′-most fragments (detected by probes 1 and 9, respectively) were found in the precipitates at a level (70–80%) similar to the undigested control (Fig. 1B). Probes 3, 4, and 6–8, however, detected almost no RNA fragments. Probe 5 that recognized the central portion (nt 1253–1513) of 20S RNA also gave a lesser but significant signal (35% of the control). A secondary structure analysis with the MFOLD program (21Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Algorithms and Thermodynamics for RNA Secondary Structure Prediction: A Practical Guide in RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1999Google Scholar) predicts that the 20S RNA genome has long distance interactions that connect the 5′-end, central, and 3′-end regions detected by probes 1, 5, and 9, respectively (Fig. 4A). Therefore, these data suggest that p91 interacts only with one or two of these sites and that the other sites are pulled down indirectly through RNA-RNA interactions. Alternatively, p91 may interact with all of three sites.FIGURE 4p91 does not interact with the first stem loop structure at the 5′-end of 20S RNA. A, computer-predicted secondary structure of 20S RNA and the deoxyoligonucleotides used for hybridization. For clarity most of the internal regions are omitted. The last two stem loop structures at the 3′-end have been detected in purified 20S RNA by S1 and V1 mapping (6Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol.

B, interaction of p91 with 20S RNA at the 5′-end region. 20S RNA/p91 complexes were treated with RNase A alone or with RNase V1 at the concentrations indicated.

GCCCC-OH) and the 3′-terminal four C nt are attached to a stem loop structure (Fig. 2B). Previously we established an in vivo launching system of 20S RNA virus from a yeast expression vector (18Esteban R. Vega L. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33725-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The vector contained the complete cDNA of the 20S RNA genome with a ribozyme sequence directly fused to its 3′-end. Using this system we found that the third and fourth C nt from the 3′-end are essential for virus generation. While the terminal and penultimate C nt were dispensable for in vivo generation, the launched virus recovered these terminal nucleotides. Furthermore, the fifth nucleotide from the 3′-end, which is a G, is dispensable but the nucleotide at this position needs to be hydrogen-bonded at the bottom of the stem for virus generation (18Esteban R. Vega L. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33725-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The inactivation of the ribozyme by changing GGG 3′ to the cleavage site to AAA results in the failure of virus generation. The vector (the expression plasmid; Fig. 2A) still can transcribe the 20S RNA genome from the promoter and p91 can be translated from the transcript. This p91 forms complexes with the 20S RNA transcripts in vivo even though they have non-viral extensions at their 3′-ends (not shown). Thus these complexes can be pulled down with anti-p91 antiserum and the 20S RNA transcripts in the precipitates can be detected by hybridization. Using this in vivo system we analyzed the effect of mutations at the 3′-end on complex formation. As shown in Fig. 2C, we found that, while changing the 3′-terminal or penultimate C to other nucleotides did not affect formation of complexes (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2), a modification at the third or fourth C impaired the activity by about 90% (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). The replication-negative mutants still retain a basal level of complex forming activity (10%). As will be shown later, the cis site at the central part appears to be responsible for this basal activity. A mutation at the fifth nucleotide (G5A) that abolished replication also affected the formation of complexes (Fig. 2, lane 5). Because this mutation also shortened the stem by one base pair, the result indicates that formation of complexes requires either a G at this position or the nucleotide in this place to be hydrogen-bonded for full activity. To examine these possibilities we carried out the experiments shown in Fig. 3. Consistent with the result with the G5A mutation, a G5C change also gave a basal level of complex forming activity (Fig. 3, lane 1). To restore base pairing at the bottom of the stem in the latter mutant, we introduced a compensatory mutation (C35G, numbered from the 3′-end) to the other side of the stem (Fig. 3, lane 3). Because this mutation also changed the amino acid sequence of p91 from Thr to Ser at codon 823 we made another control to examine the effects of this amino acid modification. p91 was changed from Thr to Ser at the same codon by A36U (numbered from the 3′-end) without modifying the sequence and structure at the 3′-stem loop in the transcripts (Fig. 3, lane 4). Both transcripts formed complexes with the modified p91 at a wild-type level. The results thus indicate that p91 tolerates the change from Thr to Ser at codon 823 to form complexes and that the fifth nucleotide G from the 3′-end is dispensable for complex formation. The results further suggest that this fifth nucleotide from the 3′-end needs to be hydrogen-bonded for full activity. This was confirmed by the failure of transcripts having the C35G mutation alone in forming complexes even though they contained a wild-type G at the fifth position (Fig. 3, lane 2). There is a clear correlation between replication and formation of complexes among the mutants analyzed in Figs. 2 and 3. All the mutants that formed complexes at a wild type level generated 20S RNA virus when expressed from a launching plasmid, whereas the mutants that formed complexes at a basal level failed to generate the virus from the launching vector. These results demonstrate that the 3′ cis site for formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes is identical to or overlaps with the 3′ cis signal for replication identified previously.FIGURE 3The fifth nucleotide G from the 3′-end in the 20S RNA genome is dispensable for formation of complexes. A, cells were transformed with the standard expression plasmid (lane C, control) or with expression plasmids modified as described for B (lanes 1–4). 20S RNA transcripts pulled-down from cell lysates with anti-p91 antiserum (Anti-p91) or with the preimmune serum (Preimmune) or 20S RNA transcripts and 25S rRNA in cell lysates (Total RNA) were detected as described in the legend to Fig. 2C. RNA from untransformed cells was also analyzed (lane–). The effects of these mutations on virus generation from launching plasmids observed previously (18Esteban R. Vega L. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33725-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) are shown on the right of the panel (Launching). The relative amounts of 20S RNA transcripts pulled-down with anti-p91 antiserum are also shown (Recovery). B, mutations (filled circles) were introduced at positions 5, 35, and 36 (numbered from the 3′-end of the 20S RNA genome) in the standard expression plasmid. The expected secondary structure and nucleotide sequence at the viral 3′-end for each construct are shown. Codon 823 of p91 is boxed, and the corresponding amino acid is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 5′-Binding Site Is Located in the Second Stem Loop Structure from the 5′-End—To locate the 5′-binding site more precisely, we took two different approaches. First, in an experiment analogous to the one shown in Fig. 1B, we used five small deoxyoligo probes that covered the region recognized by RNA probe 1 (nt 1–326), to finely map the 5′-end site (Fig. 4B). After treatment with RNase A, the 5′-most stem loop structure (Stem-loop 1, nt 1–71) was not found in the precipitate, while the second stem loop structure (Stem-loop 2, nt 72–104) or internal regions were recovered efficiently. These results suggest that the 5′-binding site is located at the Stem-loop 2 or a more internal region. The probes failed to detect RNA fragments when complexes were exhaustively digested with a mixture of RNases A and V1. In the second approach, we treated native complexes with hydroxyl radicals and determined the regions protected from cleavages by reverse transcription (Fig. 5A). Non-cleaved RNA control produced a pattern of premature reverse transcription termination (Fig. 5A, lane 3), consistent with features of the two stem loop structures shown in Fig. 5B. When native complexes were treated with hydroxyl radicals, we found two wide areas (denoted as I and II) protected from cleavages (Fig. 5A, lane 2) compared with the pattern generated from phenol-extracted 20S RNA (Fig. 5A, lane 1). The protected nucleotides are located at both sides of the stem structure in Stem-loop 2, consistent with data from the pulled-down assay with deoxyoligo probes (Fig. 4). This result suggests that p91 physically interacts with the RNA at the 5′-site and eliminates the possibility that RNA fragments containing this site were pulled down indirectly by anti-p91 antibodies through RNA-RNA interactions. Stem-loop 2 at the 5′-End Contains cis Sites for Replication and for Formation of Complexes—To confirm the above results, we introduced mutations into Stem-loop 2 and examined their effects on formation of complexes and also on virus generation. The long stem of this structure is divided into two parts by an asymmetric internal loop; a 9-bp upper stem (St-2a) and a 3-bp lower stem (St-2b) (Fig. 6A). To avoid changing the amino acid sequence of p91 we first introduced single mutations at the wobble positions in the structure. Although most of them did not affect virus generation and formation of complexes, C84G, C96G (Fig. 6), and G102C (not shown) reduced both virus generation and formation of complexes moderately. C84G and G102C also shorten St-2a and St-2b by one base pair, respectively. Then, to modify the Stem-loop 2 structure more extensively we changed the two Arg codons present in Stemloop 2. When three bases of the Arg codon 97AGG99 were changed to another Arg codon CGC, thus opening St-2a at the lower edge by three base pairs, this mutant failed to generate 20S RNA virus from the launching plasmid and also formed complexes only at a basal level (10%) when transcribed from the expression plasmid (Fig. 6C, lane 1). Neither activity requires specific nucleotides at the Arg codon because single mutations at positions 97 and 99 (A97C and G99A, respectively) showed wild-type phenotypes for both activities (Fig. 6C, lanes 2 and 3). Furthermore, when a second mutation (U78G) was introduced into the 97CGC99 mutant, thus recovering two base pairs of hydrogen bonding, this compensatory mutation not only restored the ability to generate the virus but also brought complex formation back to a wild-type level (Fig. 6C, lane 4). When the other Arg codon 82CGC84 was changed to AGA, thus shortening the St-2a at the upper edge by three base pairs, this mutation resulted in the complete loss of virus generation and also reduced formation of complexes to a basal level (Fig. 6B, lane 3). Even the single mutation C84G, that shortens the stem by one base pair, reduced virus generation and formation of complexes moderately (Fig. 6B, lane 2). On the other hand, a double mutation in the loop (Fig. 6B, lane 1) or a mismatched pair at the upper part of St-2a (Fig. 6B, lane 4) affected none of the activities. When St-2a was disturbed in its middle part by the creation of a symmetric internal loop of four or six nucleotides by combining two single mutations (U78A and C96G, or U81A and C96G), the modified RNA failed to generate the virus and also formed complexes only at a basal level (Fig. 6D, lanes 4 and 5). U78A or U81A alone did not affect either activity (Fig. 6D, lanes 2 and 3) and, as afore mentioned, C96G reduced virus generation and formation of complexes moderately (Fig. 6D, lane 1). These results indicate that Stem-loop 2 contains cis signals for replication and also for formation of complexes and that the secondary structure is important for both activities. The mutations in Stem-loop 2 described above can be divided into three groups based on the effects on replication and formation of complexes. 1) Those that did not affect virus generation from a launching vector produced complexes in amounts comparable to the wild type control. 2) Those that failed to generate the virus formed complexes at a basal level (about 10% or less compared with the wild-type control) and 3) Those (C84G, C96G, and G102C) that generated virus at a reduced level formed complexes at an intermediate level. After curing the launching plasmids, the viruses generated from the last group of mutants were induced poorly under nitrogen starvation conditions (not shown), most likely because of the instability of ribonucleoprotein complexes. These data suggest that formation of stable complexes is a prerequisite for efficient replication. Furthermore, we observed that the amounts of 20S RNA transcripts in lysates (see Total RNA columns in Figs. 2, 3, 6, and 7) decreased by 30–60% compared with the wild-type control when mutants failed to form complexes at full activity. Because these amounts represent steady-state levels, the data suggest that turnover of 20S RN"

We have previously shown that eicosapentanoic acid (EPA, C20:5, n-3) activates epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in a cAMP-dependent manner involving stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). In the present study, we explored further the mechanism of EPA stimulation of ENaC in A6 cells. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments confirmed activation of PKA by EPA. Consistent with our previous studies, EPA had no further stimulatory effect on amiloride-sensitive transepithelial current (INa) in the presence of CPT-cAMP. Thus, we investigated the effect of EPA on cellular pathways which produce cAMP. EPA did not stimulate adenylate cyclase activity or total cellular cAMP accumulation. However, membrane-bound phosphodiesterase activity was inhibited by EPA from 2.46 pmol/mg of protein/min to 1.3 pmol/mg of protein/min. To investigate the potential role of an A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP), we used HT31, an inhibitor of the binding between PKA and AKAPs as well as cerulenin, an inhibitor of myristoylation and palmitoylation. Both agents prevented the stimulatory effect of EPA and CPT-cAMP on INa and drastically decreased the amount of PKA in the apical membrane. Colocalization experiments in A6 cells cotransfected with fluorescently labeled ENaC β subunit and PKA regulatory subunit confirmed the close proximity of the two proteins and the membrane anchorage of PKA. Last, in A6 cells transfected with a dead mutant of Sgk, an enzyme which up-regulates ENaCs, EPA did not stimulate Na+ current. Our results suggest that stimulation of ENaCs by EPA occurs via SGK in membrane-bound compartments containing an AKAP, activated PKA, and a phosphodiesterase.

The mechanisms by which PUFAs modulate ion channels vary among the different cell types and channels. PUFAs may bind directly to and modulate the activity of some channels, whereas in other cases, they regulate channel activities indirectly through metabolites and protein kinases (13Rychkov G.Y. Litjens T. Roberts M.L. Barritt G.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we investigated the effects of a PUFA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5, n-3) on epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). The regulation of this channel is essential for maintenance of renal sodium balance and, hence, of arterial blood pressure (14Snyder P.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 258-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In vivo, a number of hormones and others endogenous and exogenous factors including PUFAs regulate ENaCs. In the A6 distal nephron cell line, which expresses highly selective sodium channels, we have shown that EPA activates these channels via stimulation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (15Mies F. Shlyonsky V. Goolaerts A. Sariban-Sohraby S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F850-F855Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Numerous cellular processes are initiated, modulated, or terminated by cAMP-dependent pathways, mainly the PKA pathway. Although PKA broadly affects multiple intracellular pathways, its specificity and efficiency may be enhanced by its close proximity to specific molecular targets. In this regard, a family of anchoring proteins (A-kinase-anchoring proteins, AKAPs), which compartmentalize PKA to a specific subcellular domain has been shown to modulate cAMP-mediated signaling (16Henn V.

Compartmentalization of signaling molecules through association with anchoring proteins ensures specificity in signal transduction by placing enzymes close to their appropriate effectors and substrates. AKAPs bind to the regulatory subunit of PKA which directs the kinase to discrete intracellular locations. Functional studies aimed at disrupting AKAP-PKA complexes have demonstrated a role for anchored PKA in various cellular processes, including gene transcription, hormone-mediated insulin secretion, and ion-channel modulation (11Bringmann A. Schopf S. Faude F. Reichenbach A. Graefe's Arch. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol. 2001; 239: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The A-kinase-anchoring proteins consists of two binding sites, a targeting motif to direct AKAPs to its subcellular localization and a conserved anchoring motif that binds the NH2 termini of the dimer of the RII subunit of PKA. Numerous AKAPs have been identified and are found in association with a variety of cellular compartments including centrosomes, dendrites, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, nuclear membrane, cell membrane, and vesicles. Several studies have shown that AKAPs are required for the stimulatory effect of PKA on AQP-2 water channels (9Gao T.Y. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M.

Although AKAPs have been defined on the basis of their interaction with PKA, an additional feature of many of these molecules is their ability to bind to other signaling enzymes. Of particular interest is the simultaneous binding of AKAPs to enzymes with opposing actions such as kinases and phosphatases or phosphodiesterases (24Barnes A.P. Livera G. Huang P. Sun C.

AKAP-mediated localization of phosphodiesterase (PDE) near PKA is thought to control access of cAMP to the regulatory subunit of the kinase (24Barnes A.P. Livera G. Huang P. Sun C. O'Neal W.K.

The data presented in this study suggest a model in which EPA inhibits membrane-bound phosphodiesterase activity. Local cAMP accumulation, in turn, activates AKAP-anchored PKA in the apical membrane in proximity to the Na+ channels. 4The present results were presented in part at the 2006 Experimental Biology Meeting (Mies, F., Spriet, C., Héliot, L., Shlyonsky, V., Goolaerts, A., Roch, A., and Sariban-Sohraby, S. (2006) FASEB J. 20, A347). Reagents—Rolipram, dipyridamole, IBMX, and cerulenin were obtained from Calbiochem. st-HT31 was obtained from Promega. EPA, aldosterone, CPT-cAMP, and forskolin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture—A6 cells (American Type Culture Collection derived originally from Xenopus laevis, passages 74-82) were maintained in culture on plastic flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 growth medium (Invitrogen), adapted for amphibian tissue culture osmolarity by a 20% dilution with distilled water, and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 25 units/ml penicillin and 25 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown at 28 °C in 1% CO2. For electrical measurements, cells were grown on permeable supports for 10 days (12-mm diameter inserts, Transwell, Costar). Maximum and stable values of transepithelial Na+ transport and electrical parameters are observed at this time indicating that apical Na+ channels are functional. All experiments were performed after 10 days of culture. Serum was omitted in the last 24 h. Open-circuit transepithelial voltage and resistance were measured using an EVOM volt-ohmmeter (World Precision Instruments). The corresponding amiloride-inhibitable sodium current, INa, was calculated from these values. The INa is used as an estimate of the net transepithelial sodium current under the conditions of this study. All measurements were performed in parallel on control and experimental tissues. Adenylate Cyclase Activity—Membrane were prepared from scraped cells which were pelleted and then lysed in 1 mm NaHCO3 and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the lysate was first centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 400 × g, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mm NaHCO3 and used immediately as crude membrane fraction. Adenylate cyclase activity was determined as described previously by Salomon et al. (25Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar, 26Solano R.M. Langer I. Perret J. Vertongen P. Juarranz M.G. Robbrecht P. Waelbroeck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1084-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Membrane protein (3-15 μg) was incubated in a total volume of 60 μl containing 0.5 mm ATP, 106 cpm of [α-32P]ATP/assay, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm cAMP, 1 mm theophylline, 10 mm phospho(enol)pyruvate, 30 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, with or without 20 μm GTP. The reaction was initiated by membrane addition and was terminated after a 15-min incubation at 28 °C by adding 0.5 ml of a 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution containing 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm cAMP, and 20,000 cpm of [3H]cAMP. cAMP was separated from ATP by two successive chromatographies on Dowex 50W-X8 and neutral alumina. cAMP Accumulation Assay—The tests were run according to the manufacturer's notice (cAMP Biotrak Enzymeimmunoassay system, Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, cellular cAMP content was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in the presence of inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 and revealed colorimetrically. Phosphodiesterase Assay—PDE activity was measured as described by Wells and Hardman (27Wells J.N. Hardman J.G. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1977; 8: 119-143PubMed Google Scholar). A6 cells were grown on permeable supports for 10 days before experiments were performed. Cells were suspended in homogenization buffer (30 mm mannitol, 10 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science) and disrupted using a potter. Nuclei and cytosolic proteins were removed by centrifugation at 2164 × g for 10 min, and cell membranes were separated by centrifugation of the supernatant at 41,000 × g for 25 min. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer and immediately used. Five μl of total protein were incubated in 100 μl of assay buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, cAMP between 10-7 and 10-4 m, and 15,000 cpm of [3H]cAMP) for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 1 min and 0.1 unit of 5′-nucleotidase (from Crotalus atrox venom, Sigma) was added for 25 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 800 μl of stop buffer (20 mm ammonium formate, 15 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm adenosine). [3H]Adenosine was separated by filtration on QAE-Sephadex A-25, and the filtrate was counted. Membrane Protein Biotinylation—Biotinylation and recovery of apical membrane proteins were performed using the cell surface protein isolation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's notice. Briefly, A6 monolayers grown on permeable support were exposed to st-HT31 (20 μm) for 5 min or to cerulenin (30 μg/ml) for 3 h, prior to adding sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin to the apical compartment. The basolateral compartment received culture media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum to prevent biotinylation of basolateral membranes. Biotinylated proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Actin was used as a control for the specificity of surface biotinylation. Protein was measured with BCA kit (Pierce). Western Blotting—Biotinylated apical proteins were analyzed by Western blot using an anti PKARIIα antibody (BD Biosciences). Detection was performed by addition of an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, Pierce). Colocalization PKA-ENaC—A6 cells were transfected with the regulatory and/or the catalytic subunit of PKA (fused with CFP or YFP, respectively) in pcDNA3 plasmids (kindly provided by Anna Terrin, University of Padua, Padua, Italy) and the β or γ subunit of ENaC tagged with CFP or YFP using Exgen 500 (Euromedex). Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% 48 h after transfection. Expression vectors for EYFP-βhENaC and ECFP-γhENaCγ were generated by cloning PCR products into XhoI/BamHI sites of pEYFP-C1 and into HindIII/BamHI sites of pECFP-C1. Acquisitions were performed using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope with a 100×, NA 1.4, oil immersion objective. To ensure minimal cross-talk, we used a sequential acquisition procedure with wavelengths of 458 nm (excitation) and 465-495 nm (observation) for the CFP channel, and 514 nm (excitation) and 535-560 nm (observation) for the YFP channel. Three-dimensional acquisitions were reconstructed using the Imaris software (Bitplane Inc.) allowing selection of the plane with maximum membrane contribution. The ImarisColoc module (Bitplane Inc.) was used to generate a 2D histogram from this plane by plotting pixels according to intensity in each channel and to generate Pearson correlation coefficient. The Mander's correlation coefficient was calculated for each channel using the Intensity Correlation Analysis plug-in for ImageJ (Rasband, W. S., ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/)). Coefficient values of 100% represent a perfect correlation while 0% corresponds to a noncorrelated signal and a value of -100% to an inverse correlation. Correlation's means were calculated from 30 cells. Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy and Analysis—Experiments were performed on fixed A6 cells 48 h after transfection (Exgen 500, Euromedex) with the regulatory and/or the catalytic subunit of PKA fused with CFP or YFP, respectively. We used a two-photon pulsed excitation at a wavelength of 830 nm for CFP excitation. Photon detection was performed using the Hamamatsu MCP R3809U-52 PMT. The omega XF3075 band pass filter allowed specific detection of CFP (465-500 nm). Images were acquired using a 100×, NA 1.4, oil immersion objective. The Becker & Hickl TCSPC 730 card determined the time between fluorophores excitation and photon emission. This card was driven by the Single Photon Counting software. Fluorescence decay curve fits, allowing lifetime determination, were obtained using the SPCImage software (28Camuzeaux B. Spriet C. Héliot L. Coll J. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The selection between a mono-exponential and a bi-exponential decay was performed according to the reduced χ2 parameter (29Waharte F. Spriet C. Héliot L. Cytometry A. 2006; 69: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Creation of Stably Transfected Clones—A6 cells were transfected with pCI-neo expression vectors containing the D222A sgk1 mutant with a myc tag on the NH2 terminus (kindly provided by N. Perrotti, Università Magna Graecia, Cantazaro, Italy). The cDNA was introduced to subconfluent cells growing in 24 wells plates using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) in serum-free medium. Cells were maintained in a toxic concentration (2 mg/ml) of Geneticin (Sigma) for 10 days after which clones were subcultured in 96-well plates and maintained under the selective pressure of 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin. The various clones were tested for their response to aldosterone and to EPA. Effect of EPA Suggests Local Changes in cAMP—Consistent with our previous study (15Mies F. Shlyonsky V. Goolaerts A. Sariban-Sohraby S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F850-F855Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), EPA (C20:5, n-3) transiently activated amiloride-sensitive open-circuit current (INa) from a basal value of 4.15 ± 0.24 μA/cm2 to 7.45 ± 0.48 μA/cm2 within 30 min of exposure (n = 15, p < 0.001). Since cAMP is necessary for the effect of EPA (15Mies F. Shlyonsky V. Goolaerts A. Sariban-Sohraby S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F850-F855Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we sought to measure the activity of the enzymes involved in the production/degradation balance of cAMP, namely adenylyl cyclase and cyclic nucleotide PDE. EPA did not activate adenylyl cyclase in membrane preparations (Fig. 1A) but inhibited cAMP-PDE activity by 30% (Fig. 1B). However, this inhibition was not accompanied by an increase in total cellular cAMP (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that EPA may generate a local increase in cAMP level, i.e. undetectable in total cellular cAMP, possibly by simply inhibiting a membrane-bound PDE. To get more insight in the type of PDE involved, we tested inhibitors of cAMP and cGMP PDEs. Rolipram, a selective inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase, increased INa by 62.86 ± 6.77% (Fig. 2A, first column) as expected but did not prevent the effect of EPA (second column). The arithmetic sum of the effect of rolipram alone and of EPA alone was not statistically different from the combined effect of rolipram and EPA (second column). Similar results were obtained with IBMX, a nonselective inhibitor of cAMP PDE (data not shown). These data suggest that EPA does not act on a rolipram- or IBMX-sensitive PDE. Furthermore, pretreatment of A6 cells with a high concentration of dipyridamole (300 μm), a selective inhibitor of cGMP phosphodiesterase, which at high dose inhibits cAMP-PDE8, which is insensitive to all other inhibitors, prevented the effect of EPA (Fig. 2B). The combined results obtained with rolipram, IBMX, and dipyridamole strongly suggest the involvement of PDE8.FIGURE 2Effect of PDE inhibitors on transepithelial sodium current in A6 monolayers. Data are expressed as percent increase over the time 0 value set at 100%. A, rolipram does not prevent the effect of EPA. Cells were incubated with 3 μm of rolipram for 10 min prior the addition of 33 μm EPA. Effect of EPA alone (33 μm) is shown at 40 min and rolipram alone (3 μm) at 50 min. **, p < 0.001 versus rolipram, unpaired t test, n = 3. B, high dose of dipyridamole prevents the effect of EPA. Cells were incubated with 300 μm dipyridamole for 10 min prior the addition of 33 μm EPA. Effect of EPA alone (33 μm) is shown at 40 min and dipyridamole alone (300 μm) at 50 min. p > 0.05 versus dipyridamole, unpaired t test, n = 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In A6 cells pretreated with 100 μm CPT-cAMP, a permeant analog of cAMP, INa increased as expected and no additive effect of EPA was observed indicating a common pathway (Fig. 3A, closed circles). Alone, lower concentrations of CPT-cAMP, ranging between 5 and 50 μm, had no effect on INa (Fig. 3B, open circles). Similarly, a low concentration of EPA (20 μm) had no effect on INa. However, in combination, 20 μm EPA with CPT-cAMP concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 μm yielded significant increases of INa averaging between 30 and 50% (Fig. 3B, closed circles). These results indicate that in the presence of EPA, small increases in cAMP become sufficient to activate PKA. Since no increase in total cell cAMP was detected in cells exposed to EPA, we hypothesized that local increases in cAMP near sodium channels may be attributed to PDE inhibition specifically at the apical membrane. Local Changes in cAMP Activate Membrane-associated PKA—To test for membrane localization of PKA, A6 cells were transiently cotransfected with the regulatory subunit of PKA (RII) fused to CFP and with the β subunit of ENaC fused toYFP. Fig. 4A shows the colocalization of the two proteins in whole cells (white). Expression level of βENaC-YFP was heterogeneous but seemed colocalized with RII-CFP, preferentially at the membrane level (Fig. 4B) where CFP versus YFP fluorescence emission was highly correlated (Fig. 4C) as indicated by a Pearson's correlation of 93.1 ± 1.7% and by Mander's correlation coefficients of 98.7 ± 0.5% and 94.2 ± 1.6% for CFP and YFP channels, respectively. Since PKA and ENaC are colocalized, it was of interest to examine the influence of EPA on a membrane-specific activity of PKA. An important step in PKA activation is the dissociation of the catalytic from the regulatory subunit of the enzyme. This was examined using fluorescence lifetime imaging where the fluorescent energy transfer between catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA was determined in response to EPA. As a reference for no interaction between subunits, we used A6 cells expressing the recombinant PKA RII alone tagged with cyan fluorescent protein (RII-CFP; mean lifetime of 1956 ± 46 ps, Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows A6 cells coexpressing RII-CFP simultaneously with the PKA catalytic subunit tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (C-YFP). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was detected as indicated by a decrease in the measured lifetime (1724 ± 49 ps). Treatment with EPA resulted in a loss of FRET as evidenced by the mean lifetime increasing back toward control levels (1866 ± 53 ps, Fig. 5C) consistent with dissociation of the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PKA. These data are summarized in Fig. 5D. In the absence of EPA, a detectable energy transfer between associated RII-CFP and C-YFP subunits was observed that disappeared in EPA stimulated cells. These data indicate activation of membrane associated PKA by EPA. Effect of EPA Involves an AKAP—As PKA and many of its substrates are present throughout the cell, one means of having a localized action would result from compartmentalization of PKA. AKAP 18, a low molecular weight anchoring protein, targets PKA to the cell membrane (23Fraser I.D.C. Tavelin S.J. Lester L.B. Langeberg L.K. Westphal A.M. Dean R.A. Marrion N.V. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2261-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), which, if near Na+ channels, could facilitate activation by cAMP-dependant phosphorylation. To test the role of an AKAP in our model, we used st-HT31, a peptide that disrupts the binding between AKAP and PKA. Fig. 6A shows that pretreatment of cells with st-HT31 (20 μm) for 5 min prevented the EPA stimulation of sodium current. Similarly, pretreatment of cells with st-HT31 also prevented stimulation of INa by 100 μm CPT-cAMP. Inactive st-HT31 control peptide did not prevent EPA's effect (Fig. 6B). Because lipid modification through myristoylation and palmitoylation is necessary to promote the specific association of AKAP 18 with the cell membrane (23Fraser I.D.C. Tavelin S.J. Lester L.B.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2261-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of cerulenin, an acylation reaction and fatty acid biosynthesis inhibitor, on the action of EPA. As shown in Fig. 6C, pretreatment of A6 cells with 30 μg/ml cerulenin for 30 min prevented the stimulatory effect of EPA on INa. st-HT-31 peptide and cerulenin also caused a significant decrease of PKA levels in apical membranes of A6 cells as shown in Fig. 7. Densitometry scanning revealed a 84.5 ± 3.9% decrease i"
https://openalex.org/W1990250054,"We have tested the idea that calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase that is critical for activating cytokine gene expression in helper T cells, plays a role in lytic granule exocytosis in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). We used TALL-104 human leukemic CTLs as a model. Our results confirm an earlier report (Dutz, J. P., Fruman, D. A., Burakoff, S. J., and Bierer, B. E. (1993) J. Immunol. 150, 2591–2598) that immunosuppressive drugs inhibit exocytosis in CTLs stimulated either via the T cell receptor (TCR) or via TCR-independent soluble agents. Of the two recently reported alternate targets of immunosuppressive drugs (Matsuda, S., Shibasaki, F., Takehana, K., Mori, H., Nishida, E., and Koyasu, S. (2000) EMBO Rep. 1, 428–434 and Matsuda, S., and Koyasu, S. (2000) Immunopharmacology 47, 119–125), JNK is not required for lytic granule exocytosis, but we were not able to exclude a role for P38. Exocytosis could be inhibited by expressing GFP fused to a C-terminal fragment of CAIN (cabin 1), but not by expressing VIVIT-GFP. Finally, expressing either full-length or truncated constitutively active mutant calcineurin A enhanced lytic granule exocytosis. However, the mutant calcineurin was unable to support exocytosis when cells were stimulated in the absence of Ca2+ influx. Taken together, our results support the idea that activation of calcineurin is required for lytic granule exocytosis but suggest that it is not the sole Ca2+-dependent step."
https://openalex.org/W2001915094,"Coordination between cell proliferation and differentiation is important in normal development and oncogenesis. These processes usually have an antagonistic relationship, in that differentiation is blocked in proliferative cells, and terminally differentiated cells do not divide. In some instances, cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their inhibitors (CKIs) play important roles in this antagonistic regulation. However, it is unknown whether CKIs and cyclin/CDKs regulate the uncommitted state in quiescent cells where CDK activities are likely to be low. Here, we show in C. elegans that cye-1/cyclin E and cdk-2/CDK2 repress terminal differentiation in quiescent cells. In cye-1 mutants and cdk-2(RNAi) animals, after asymmetric division, certain quiescent cells adopted their sister cells' phenotype and differentiated at some frequency. In contrast, in cki-1(RNAi) animals, these cells underwent extra divisions, while, in cki-1(RNAi); cdk-2(RNAi) or cki-1(RNAi); cye-1 animals, they remained quiescent or differentiated. Therefore, in wild-type animals, CKI-1/CKI in these cells maintained quiescence by inhibiting CYE-1/CDK-2, while sufficient CYE-1/CDK-2 remained to repress the terminal differentiation. The difference between sister cells is regulated by the Wnt/MAP kinase pathway, which causes asymmetric expression of CYE-1 and CKI-1. Our results suggest that the balance between the levels of CKI and cyclin E determines three distinct cell states: terminally differentiated, quiescent and uncommitted, and proliferating."

Herein, 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) specific to the glucose 6-phosphate transporter-1 (G6PT1) enabled reduction of hepatic d-Glu-6-phosphatase activity in diabetic ob/ob mice. Treatment with G6PT1 ASOs decreased G6PT1 expression, reduced G6PT1 activity, blunted glucagon-stimulated glucose production, and lowered plasma glucose concentration in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast to G6PT1 knock-out mice and patients with glycogen storage disease, excess hepatic and renal glycogen accumulation, hyperlipidemia, neutropenia, and elevations in plasma lactate and uric acid did not occur. In addition, hypoglycemia was not observed in animals during extended periods of fasting, and the ability of G6PT1 ASO-treated mice to recover from an exogenous insulin challenge was not impaired.

Together, these results demonstrate that effective glucose lowering by G6PT1 inhibitors can be achieved without adversely affecting carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Hepatic control of glucose homeostasis is achieved by coordinating signaling pathways that regulate glycogen synthesis, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis (1Barthel A. Schmoll D. Am. J.

During nutrient intake, d-glucose is taken up from the circulation into hepatocytes by the GLUT2 transporter. Glucokinase/hexokinase-4 phosphorylates d-glucose at C-6, yielding d-glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), 2The abbreviations used are: G6P, d-glucose 6-phosphate; G6Pase, d-glucose-6-phosphatase; G6PC, d-glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit; G6PT, glucose 6-phosphate transporter; GSD, glycogen storage disease; ASOs, antisense oligonucleotides; RT, reverse transcription. which is converted into d-glucose 1-phosphate for glycogen synthesis and into fructose 6-phosphate for lipid and amino acid synthesis and energy metabolism. In the postabsorptive state, glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the release of glucose from chains of glycogen, and as this supply is depleted, de novo glucose is synthesized from lactate, amino acids, and glycerol via the process of gluconeogenesis. The end product of both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis is G6P, which must be hydrolyzed by d-glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) to yield d-glucose that can be released into the bloodstream. Together, the combined net flux through glucokinase and G6Pase determines the contribution of the liver to whole body glucose homeostasis. G6Pase is a multicomponent enzyme anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum that is composed of membrane-spanning catalytic (G6PC-α and/or G6PC-β) (4Lei K.J. Shelly L.L. Pan C-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y.

Inability to suppress hepatic glucose production because of insulin deficiency or resistance is a key defect in diabetes, and thus, attempts to develop molecules that inhibit glycogenolytic or gluconeogenic enzymes have been widely pursued as new treatments (17Kurukulasuriya R.

In addition to the liver, the kidneys and intestine are capable of endogenous glucose production, although hepatic glucose production is quantitatively more important, and regulatory control of the liver by hormones such as insulin and glucagon is better understood. As with hepatic glucose production, G6Pase is also required for glucose release by kidney and intestine. Because G6Pase is the obligate terminal control point for release of glucose generated by either glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis, it is an attractive target for inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Unfortunately, the complete loss of a functioning G6Pase system leads to severe metabolic abnormalities. Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type 1a is caused by a deficiency of G6PC-α(4Lei K.J. Shelly L.L. Pan C-J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and GSD-1b results from mutations in G6PT1 (9Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y.

Westphal H. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and inactivating mutations in either gene lead to multiple physiologic disturbances, including hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, nephromegaly, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, and lactic acidosis (reviewed in Refs. 21Chou J.Y.

J. 2002; 362: 513-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, recent compelling evidence indicates that limited replenishment of G6Pase activity in rodent models of GSD via adenovirus-mediated gene therapy can normalize plasma glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations and dramatically reduce liver and kidney enlargement and glycogen deposition in these organs (23Chou J.Y.

Thus, because of its key regulatory role in hepatic glucose production and because only limited G6Pase activity is needed to avoid complications of GSD, we chose to test the hypothesis that reducing the activity of the G6Pase system would improve hyperglycemia in diabetes using 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) specific to G6PT1. The use of this chemical platform is advantageous because active molecules can be quickly identified, synthesized, and tested directly in primary hepatocytes and rodent models of type 2 diabetes (26Butler M.

In addition, the pharmacokinetic properties of ASOs allow studies evaluating the long-term inhibition of targeted genes (29Zhang H. Cook J. Nickel J. Yu R. Stecker K. Myers K. Dean N.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 862-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The studies presented here demonstrate that chronically decreasing hepatic G6Pase activity in diabetic mice effectively lowers their blood glucose concentrations. Notably, this occurs without excessive hepatic glycogen accumulation, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, lactic acidosis, or hypoglycemia. Design and Identification of the G6PT1 ASO Inhibitor—A total of 175 ASOs targeting mouse G6PT1 sequences were designed as 20-base full phosphorothioate chimeric 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl-modified ASOs. These molecules represent a class of 20-base chimeric ASOs in which an RNase H-sensitive stretch of 10 2′-deoxy residues is flanked on both sides with a stretch of five 2′-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl modifications. This modification increases mRNA binding affinity and confers nuclease resistance, whereas the chimeric design supports an RNase H-terminating mechanism (30McKay R.A. Miraglia L.J. Cummins L.L.

Lead ASOs were screened in primary mouse hepatocytes as described previously (28Sloop K.W. Cao J.X. Siesky A.M. Zhang H.Y. Bodenmiller D.M. Cox A.L. Jacobs S.J. Moyers J.S. Owens R.A. Showalter A.D.

Following in vitro characterization of lead molecules from the initial screens, G6PT1 ASO ISIS 149008 (hybridizes to bases 1860-1879 of mouse G6PT1 sequence NM_008063.1) was identified as the most potent G6PT1 ASO. The control ASO (ISIS 141923) used in these studies is of the same chemistry, design, and length as the active G6PT1 ASO. It is a generic chemistry control that does not have perfect complementarity to any gene in public data bases (sequence 5′-CCTTCCCTGAAGGTTCCTCC-3′). Animal Care and Treatments—C57Bl/6OlaHsd-Lepob (ob/ob) male mice and lean (C57Bl/6 or db+/?) male mice were purchased from Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Animals were acclimated for 1 week prior to study initiation. Mice were housed five per cage in polycarbonate cages with filter tops and maintained on a 12/12-h light-dark cycle (lights on at 6:00 a.m.) at 21 °C. All animals received deionized water ad libitum. Lean mice received Purina Diet 5008, whereas ob/ob mice received Purina Diet 5015 ad libitum. G6PT1 and control ASOs were prepared in normal saline, and the solutions were sterilized through a 0.2-μm filter. Animals were dosed with ASO solutions twice per week (separated by 3.5 days) via subcutaneous injection. Before the initiation of each study and periodically during the study, blood was collected by tail clip without anesthesia into EDTA plasma tubes. Food intake and body weights were measured weekly. Metabolite and Hematology Measurements—Plasma concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, uric acid, lactate, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were determined using a Hitachi 912 clinical chemistry analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). For determination of liver triglycerides, 20% liver homogenates were prepared in deionized water using lysing matrix D tubes (Qbiogene, Inc.). Triglycerides in liver homogenates were assayed enzymatically using the Hitachi 912 triglyceride assay. In addition, plasma levels of insulin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were determined by Luminex immunoassay (Linco Diagnostic Services, St. Charles, MO). For measurement of hematologic parameters, whole blood samples in EDTA anticoagulant were analyzed with an ADVIA 120 system (Bayer HealthCare, Tarrytown, NY). Blood cell morphology was assessed by light microscopy using blood smears stained using an ADVIA S60 system (Bayer HealthCare). Histology and Electron Microscopy—For light microscopic assessment, liver and sternal bone marrow were collected in 10% buffered neutral formalin at necropsy, processed routinely, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin and/or periodic acid-Schiff staining with or without diastase digestion. For electron microscopic examination, small tissue fragments of liver were collected in modified Karnovsky's fixative at necropsy, post-fixed in osmium tetroxide and potassium ferrocyanide, processed routinely, embedded in epoxy resin blocks, and sectioned. Images were obtained from sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and/or from unstained sections with a Gatan MultiScan camera. Liver Slice and Glycogen Assay Methods—Glucose output from liver slices was measured and liver glycogen assays were performed as described previously (28Sloop K.W. Cao J.X. Siesky A.M. Zhang H.Y. Bodenmiller D.M. Cox A.L. Jacobs S.J. Moyers J.S. Owens R.A. Showalter A.D. Brenner M.B. Raap A. Gromada J. Berridge B.R. Monteith D.K. Porksen N. McKay R.A. Monia B.P. Bhanot S. Watts L.M.

For kidney glycogen determination, one kidney from each animal was homogenized in 1 ml of 3 m perchloric acid on ice. Samples were vortexed briefly, and 50 μl of extract was added to 500 μl of amyloglucosidase solution (50 mm sodium acetate, 0.02% bovine serum albumin (pH 5.5), and 50 μg/ml amyloglucosidase) to enzymatically cleave glycogen to glucose in an overnight incubation at room temperature. Glucose was measured in the supernatant by analyzing NADPH fluorescence after hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction using standard methods, and glycogen content is reported as μmol of glucose/ng of kidney tissue. Preparation of Hepatic and Renal Microsomes—Microsomes from non-fasted mouse liver and kidney were isolated similarly to the method of Williams et al. (31Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) using differential centrifugation. Tissues were homogenized at 1:1 (w/v) in buffered sucrose (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose (pH 7.4)) containing Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Diagnostics) using a Teflon/glass motorized Potter-Elvehjem tissue grinder. The homogenate was brought to 20% (v/v) with additional homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant retained the microsomal fraction and was placed in thick-wall polycarbonate tubes for ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the microsomal pellet was rinsed with storage buffer (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) with Complete protease inhibitor tablets) to clear excess lipids. The microsomal pellet was resuspended with four strokes of a manual Potter-Elvehjem mortar and pestle. Protein concentrations were determined using the modified Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay). Microsomes were either stored at -80 °C or directly tested in enzyme assays. Measurement of G6PC and G6PT1 Activity in Microsomal Preparations—G6Pase activity was assessed by the detection of Pi resulting from the hydrolysis of d-mannose 6-phosphate or G6P (32Burchell A. Hume R. Burchell B. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 173: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 33Arion W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 174: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The latency of microsomal preparations was determined by assaying d-mannose 6-phosphate hydrolysis in intact versus detergent-disrupted microsomes. The G6Pase activity of intact microsomes was corrected for the portion of activity resulting from the disrupted vesicles within untreated preparations (13Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls H.E. Ballas L.M.

Disodium G6P and disodium d-mannose 6-phosphate salts were purchased from Sigma. Microsomal preparations were disrupted by 0.2% sodium deoxycholate treatment for 20 min. Sixty mg of protein for intact microsomes and 6 mg of disrupted microsomes were assayed for G6Pase activity in 100-μl reactions at 30 °C in 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 2 mm EDTA, and 5 mm substrate. After 15 min, reactions were terminated, and Pi was quantified by adding 900 μl of detection reagent containing 6 parts 0.42% ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate in 1 n H2SO4, 2 parts 2% SDS, and 1 part 1% ascorbic acid (33Arion W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 174: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The color was developed for 25 min at 45 °C, and absorbance was measured at 820 nm. External standards were generated by serial dilution of potassium phosphate monobasic, and unknowns were interpolated from the standard curve. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RNA isolation and reverse transcription was performed as described previously (28Sloop K.W. Cao J.X. Siesky A.M. Zhang H.Y. Bodenmiller D.M. Cox A.L. Jacobs S.J. Moyers J.S. Owens R.A. Showalter A.D. Brenner M.B. Raap A. Gromada J. Berridge B.R. Monteith D.K. Porksen N. McKay R.A. Monia B.P. Bhanot S. Watts L.M. Michael M.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1571-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the 5′-fluorogenic nuclease assay and the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to determine the relative abundance of assayed mRNAs. Samples were normalized using RiboGreen (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or the abundance of 36B4 mRNA. The 5′ terminus of fluorogenic probes was labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein or VIC. The 3′ terminus contained the quenching dye 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. Primers and probes were synthesized by Biosearch Technologies, Inc. (Novato, CA) or Applied Biosystems. Primer and probe sequences were as follows: mouse G6PT1 primers, 5′-GAAGGCAGGGCTGTCTCTGTAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCATCCCAGCCATCATGAG-3′ (reverse); mouse G6PT1 TaqMan probe, 5′-AACCCTCGCCACGGCCTATTGC-3′; mouse 36B4 primers, 5′-GGCCCGAGAAGACCTCCTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCAATGGTGCCTCTGGAGATT-3′ (reverse); and mouse 36B4 TaqMan probe, 5′-CCAGGCTTTGGGCATCACCACG-3′. Primers and probes were also obtained as Applied Biosystems TaqMan gene expression assays: G6PC-α (Assay ID Mm00839363_m1), G6PC-β (Assay ID Mm00616234_m1), G6PT1 (Assay ID Mm00484574_m1), SREBP1 (Assay ID Mm00550338_m1), SREBP2 (Assay ID Mm01306294_m1), ACC1 (Assay ID Mm01304257_m1), fatty acid synthase (Assay ID Mm00662319_m1), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Assay ID Mm00440636_m1). PCRs were run in triplicate 20-μl reactions that contained Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 4 pmol of each forward and reverse primer, 3 pmol of probe, and cDNA. Two-step PCR cycling was carried out as follows: 50 °C for 2 min for one cycle, 95 °C for 10 min for one cycle, and 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. Statistics—Data are represented as the means ± S.E. and were compared using Student's t test. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess the statistical significance between time courses. Tukey's method was used to adjust p values for multiple comparisons. The null hypothesis was rejected at p < 0.05. In vitro screens identified the G6PT1 ASO (ISIS 149008), which decreased the levels of G6PT1 mRNA in primary mouse hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To test the hypothesis that lowering G6PT1 levels would decrease hepatic G6Pase activity and decrease plasma glucose concentration in diabetes, 7-8-week-old ob/ob mice were dosed via subcutaneous injection twice per week with either the G6PT1 or control (ISIS 141923) ASO for 4 weeks. Hyperglycemia continued to worsen over time in control ASO-treated animals; however, the concentration of plasma glucose decreased in G6PT1 ASO-treated ob/ob mice almost into the normal range (Fig. 1B). A similar effect on glucose lowering was observed in diabetic male db/db mice (data not shown). In hyperinsulinemic ob/ob mice, improved glycemic control upon G6PT1 ASO treatment resulted in reduced plasma insulin levels (11.7 ± 2.1 ng/ml in control ASO-treated ob/ob mice versus 6.3 ± 1.3 ng/ml in G6PT1 ASO-treated ob/ob mice, p < 0.05). At the end of the 4-week treatment period, liver G6PT1 mRNA was reduced by 80-90% (Fig. 1B). No difference in food consumption was observed between control and G6PT1 ASO-treated animals (data not shown). In dose ranging studies, plasma glucose concentration, the abundance of hepatic G6PT1 mRNA, and G6P hydrolysis in intact liver microsomes were all reduced in a dose-dependent manner by G6PT1 ASO therapy (Fig. 1C). The reduction of G6P uptake in liver microsomes from G6PT1 ASO-treated mice was similar to that obtained in experiments evaluating G6P transport in microsomes treated with small molecular weight G6PT1 inhibitors (35Hemmerle H.

However, our results differed from those obtained with liver microsomes from patients with GSD-1b (39Lange A.J. Arion W.J. Beaudet A.L. J. Biol.

Westphal H. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2547-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), in which G6P transport was abolished. Notably, however, the G6PT1 ASO hepatic microsome results mirror G6P uptake data from G6PT1 knock-out mice infused with adenoviral vector-containing G6PT1, where partial G6PT1 replenishment enabled some G6P transport (25Yiu W.H. Pan C-J. Allamarvdasht M. Kim S.Y. Chou J.Y. Gene Ther. 2007; 14: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, although reducing G6PT1 levels lowered blood glucose levels in diabetic rodents, maintaining some capacity to hydrolyze G6P is likely important because severe hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis occur in animals and humans with GSD caused by the complete loss of a functioning G6Pase system (reviewed in Refs. 21Chou J.Y. Mansfield B.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 104-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and 22Van Schaftingen E. Gerin I. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 513-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The decrease in G6P transport in liver microsomes from G6PT1 ASO-treated mice (Fig. 1C) was consistent with a decrease in the rates of both basal and glucagon-stimulated glucose production from liver slices (Fig. 2A). A similar correlation has previously been observed in studies with G6PT1 inhibitors assessing glucose output from primary hepatocytes (36Parker J.C. VanVolkenburg M.A. Levy C.B. Martin W.H. Burk S.H. Kwon Y. Giragossian C. Gant T.G. Carpino P.A. McPherson R.K. Vestergaard P. Treadway J.L.

Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Attempts to perform liver slice experiments in the diabetic models were unsuccessful because of technical difficulties isolating consistent cores from severely steatotic livers. Although glucose output was significantly blunted, G6PT1 ASO treatment did not result in excessive accumulation of liver glycogen (Table 1). Consistent with the proposed mechanism of action, the decrease in hepatic glycogen content during a 16-h fast was blunted in animals receiving G6PT1 ASO treatment (Table 1). To further assess hepatic glycogen metabolism, non-diabetic animals were treated for 6 weeks and then challenged with extended periods of fasting. Again, depletion of liver glycogen was blunted in G6PT1 ASO-treated mice compared with controls at 6 h of fasting. However, hepatic glycogen content was indistinguishable between the groups at the 12- and 24-h time points (Fig. 2B).TABLE 1Metabolic parameters in normal and diabetic mice treated with G6PT1 ASOsMetabolic parameterob/ob miceLean miceFedFastedFedFastedControl ASOG6PT1 ASOControl ASOG6PT1 ASOControl ASOG6PT1 ASOControl ASOG6PT1 ASOBody weight (g)55.0 ± 2.153.5 ± 0.553.8 ± 0.952.8 ± 1.229.8 ± 0.929.6 ± 0.629.0 ± 0.228.9 ± 0.8Glucose (mg/dl)437 ± 65197 ± 11ap < 0.05 compared with the control ASO at the same feeding status.214 ± 34131 ± 16ap < 0.05 compared with the control ASO at the same feeding status.208 ± 6213 ± 1182 ± 288 ± 5Insulin (ng/ml)11.7 ± 2.16.3 ± 1.3ap < 0.05 compared with the control ASO at the same feeding status.2.4 ± 0.62.4 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.1Glucagon (pg/ml)568 ± 125669 ± 226404 ± 70553 ± 59136 ± 17139 ± 10174 ± 14216 ± 14Triglycerides (mg/dl)132 ± 9113 ± 10168 ± 7205 ± 20Cholesterol (ng/ml)250 ± 10251 ± 12129 ± 5133 ± 4Liver triglycerides (mg/g)49 ± 863 ± 459 ± 2181 ± 145 ± 06 ± 190 ± 495 ± 3Liver glycogen (μmol/g)197 ± 19238 ± 1153 ± 9186 ± 19ap < 0.05 compared with the control ASO at the same feeding status.107 ± 3387 ± 16<21 ± 1Kidney glycogen (μmol/g)7.2 ± 0.277.2 ± 0.265.2 ± 0.316.3 ± 0.473.3 ± 0.464.5 ± 0.592.4 ± 0.092.9 ± 0.21a p < 0.05 compared with"
https://openalex.org/W2081867303,"Recent advances in large-scale ensemble recordings allow monitoring of activity patterns of several hundreds of neurons in freely behaving animals. The emergence of such high-dimensional datasets poses challenges for the identification and analysis of dynamical network patterns. While several types of multivariate statistical methods have been used for integrating responses from multiple neurons, their effectiveness in pattern classification and predictive power has not been compared in a direct and systematic manner. Here we systematically employed a series of projection methods, such as Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA), Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and compared them with non-projection multivariate statistical methods such as Multivariate Gaussian Distributions (MGD). Our analyses of hippocampal data recorded during episodic memory events and cortical data simulated during face perception or arm movements illustrate how low-dimensional encoding subspaces can reveal the existence of network-level ensemble representations. We show how the use of regularization methods can prevent these statistical methods from over-fitting of training data sets when the trial numbers are much smaller than the number of recorded units. Moreover, we investigated the extent to which the computations implemented by the projection methods reflect the underlying hierarchical properties of the neural populations. Based on their ability to extract the essential features for pattern classification, we conclude that the typical performance ranking of these methods on under-sampled neural data of large dimension is MDA>PCA>ANN>MGD."
https://openalex.org/W2014142296,"A novel expression system based on engineered variants of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) dsRNA virus L-A was developed allowing the in vivo assembly of chimeric virus-like particles (VLPs) as a unique platform for a wide range of applications. We show that polypeptides fused to the viral capsid protein Gag self-assemble into isometric VLP chimeras carrying their cargo inside the capsid, thereby not only effectively preventing proteolytic degradation in the host cell cytosol, but also allowing the expression of a per se cytotoxic protein. Carboxyterminal extension of Gag by T cell epitopes from human cytomegalovirus pp65 resulted in the formation of hybrid VLPs that strongly activated antigen-specific CD8(+) memory T cells ex vivo. Besides being a carrier for polypeptides inducing antigen-specific immune responses in vivo, VLP chimeras were also shown to be effective in the expression and purification of (i) a heterologous model protein (GFP), (ii) a per se toxic protein (K28 alpha-subunit), and (iii) a particle-associated and fully recyclable biotechnologically relevant enzyme (esterase A). Thus, yeast viral Gag represents a unique platform for the in vivo assembly of chimeric VLPs, equally attractive and useful in vaccine development and recombinant protein production."
https://openalex.org/W1999797135,"The EAST protein of Drosophila is a component of an expandable extrachromosomal domain of the nucleus. To better understand its function, we studied the dynamics and localization of GFP-tagged EAST. In live larval salivary glands, EAST-GFP is highly mobile and localizes to the extrachromosomal nucleoplasm. When these cells are permeabilized, EAST-GFP rapidly associated with polytene chromosomes. The affinity to chromatin increases and mobility decreases with decreasing salt concentration. Deleting the C-terminal residues 1535 to 2301 of EAST strongly reduces the affinity to polytene chromosomes. The bulk of EAST-GFP co-localizes with heterochromatin and is absent from transcriptionally active chromosomal regions. The predominantly chromosomal localization of EAST-GFP can be detected in non-detergent treated salivary glands of pupae as they undergo apoptosis, however not in earlier stages of development. Consistent with this chromosomal pattern of localization, genetic evidence indicates a role for EAST in the repression of gene expression, since a lethal east mutation is allelic to the viable mutation suppressor of white-spotted. We propose that EAST acts as an ion sensor that modulates gene expression in response to changing intracellular ion concentrations."
