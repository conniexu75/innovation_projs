https://openalex.org/W2101019889,"Sprouty was genetically identified as an antagonist of fibroblast growth factor signaling during tracheal branching in Drosophila. In this study, we provide a functional characterization of mammalian Sprouty1 and Sprouty2. Sprouty1 and Sprouty2 inhibited events downstream of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and regulated both cell proliferation and differentiation. Using NIH3T3 cell lines conditionally expressing Sprouty1 or Sprouty2, we found that these proteins specifically inhibit the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway by preventing Ras activation. In contrast, activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway was not affected by Sprouty1 or Sprouty2. We further showed that Sprouty1 and Sprouty2 do no prevent the formation of a SNT·Grb2·Sos complex upon fibroblast growth factor stimulation, yet block Ras activation. Taken together, these results establish mammalian Sprouty proteins as important negative regulators of growth factor signaling and suggest that Sprouty proteins act downstream of the Grb2·Sos complex to selectively uncouple growth factor signals from Ras activation and the MAP Kinase pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2076614498,"Here we show that HDAC7, a member of the class II histone deacetylases, specifically targets several members of myocyte enhancer factors, MEF2A, -2C, and -2D, and inhibits their transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DNA-bound MEF2C is capable of recruiting HDAC7, demonstrating that the HDAC7-dependent repression of transcription is not due to the inhibition of the MEF2 DNA binding activity. The data also suggest that the promoter bound MEF2 is potentially capable of remodeling adjacent nucleosomes via the recruitment of HDAC7. We have also observed a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC7 and dissected the mechanism involved. In NIH3T3 cells, HDAC7 was primarily localized in the cytoplasm, essentially due to an active CRM1-dependent export of the protein from the nucleus. Interestingly, in HeLa cells, HDAC7 was predominantly nuclear. In these cells we could restore the cytoplasmic localization of HDAC7 by expressing CaMK I. This CaMK I-induced nuclear export of HDAC7 was abolished when three critical serines, Ser-178, Ser-344, and Ser-479, of HDAC7 were mutated. We show that these serines are involved in the direct interaction of HDAC7 with 14-3-3. Mutations of these serine residues weakened the association with 14-3-3 and dramatically enhanced the repression activity of HDAC7 in NIH3T3 cells, but not in HeLa cells. Data presented in this work clearly show that the signal dependent subcellular localization of HDAC7 is essential in controlling its activities. The data also show that the cellular concentration of factors such as 14-3-3, CaMK I, and other yet unknown molecules may determine the subcellular localization of an individual HDAC member in a cell type and HDAC-specific manner.

Recent studies strongly suggest that the amino-terminal tail of histones play a critical role in the chromatin structure and hence, the regulation of gene expression (1Cheung P. Allis C.D.

The amino-terminal tails of histones are targets for several modifications including methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. While histone acetylation at specific lysines is associated with transcriptional activation, deacetylated histones are found in transcriptionally silent regions. The acetylation status of the histone tails is determined by the interplay between histoneacetyltransferases and histonedeacetylases (HDACs).1 It has been recently suggested that promoter-specific transcription factors recruit either coactivators or co-repressors to achieve their positive or negative regulation. Notably, co-activators such as CBP/p300, PCAF, and p160 family proteins possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and therefore, normally activate transcription (6Bannister A.J.

In several cases, physical association between promoter-specific transcription factors and HDACs have been reported (16Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Mammalian class II HDACs include HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, and HDAC9, sizes ranging from 938 to 1215 amino acids (17Khochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C. Seigneurin-Berny D. Curr. Opin. Genet.

HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 constitute a subclass that besides a catalytic domain localized in their carboxyl-terminal region, contain an NH2-terminal non-catalytic region showing certain extent of sequence homology with each other. Among these three HDACs, HDAC7 contains the most divergent sequence in its amino terminus. This region of HDAC7 possesses, however, three short regions containing sequences highly conserved in other members (20Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have recently identified HDAC5 and HDAC7 as SMRT (silencing mediator forretinoid and thyroid hormone receptors) and N-CoR (nuclear receptorco-repressor) interacting factors (20Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar, 24Huang E.Y. Zhang J. Miska E.A. Guenther M.G. Kouzarides T. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar). All three members of the subclass harbor at least two repression domains including the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain that is responsible for the interaction with SMRT and N-CoR. The MEF2 proteins constitute a family of transcription factors involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes including muscle differentiation, T cell apoptosis, and the survival of neurons (25Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 26Lilly B. Zhao B. Ranganayakulu G. Paterson B.M. Schulz R.A. Olson E.N.

Development. 1994; 120: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four MEF2 proteins (MEF2A-D) have been identified and they bind to their cognate DNA sequence as homodimers or heterodimers. Both positive and negative regulators have been shown to influence the transcriptional activity of MEF2 (30Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The coactivator, p300 protein, appears to regulate MEF2 activity through direct association with NFAT (31Youn H.D. Chatila T.A.

In contrast, class II histone deacetylases, HDAC4 and HDAC5, repress MEF2 activity through direct physical interaction (18Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T.

A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In addition, a number of other transcription factors including MyoD have been shown to play a role in regulating MEF2 activity through direct association (37Wong M.W. Pisegna M. Lu M.F. Leibham D. Perry M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Leibham D. Wong M.W. Cheng T.C. Schroeder S. Weil P.A. Olson E.N. Perry M. Mol. Cell.

During muscle differentiation, MEF2 proteins activate the expression of many muscle-specific genes. Recent reports suggest that nuclear export of HDAC4 and HDAC5 may be involved in this process (18Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T.

The subcellular localization of both HDAC4 and HDAC5 are regulated through a carboxyl-terminal nuclear export sequence and a direct association with 14-3-3 which mediates their Crm1-dependent export (44Grozinger C.M.

In this study, we demonstrate that HDAC7 is capable of interacting with MEF2 proteins through a conserved domain in the HDAC7 NH2-terminal region and the MADS-box and MEF2 domain in MEF2 proteins. The fact that DNA-bound MEF2 is capable of recruiting HDAC7 indicates the potential ability of this deacetylase in remodeling chromatin associated with MEF2 responsive genes. We then show that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC7 is intimately linked to the control of its activity and moreover, our data indicate that the presence and the abundance of molecules such as 14-3-3 and CaMK I can account for the different subcellular localization of HDAC7 in various cell lines. The plasmids pCMX, pCMX-GAL4 DBD, pCMX-mHDAC7-HA, pCMX-YFP-mHDAC5, pCMX-YFP-mHDAC7, and pMH100-TK-luc have been described (20Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). Standard polymerase chain reaction amplifications and subcloning techniques were employed to generate pCMX NH2-terminal FLAG and HA epitope-tagged and GAL4 fusion MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D constructs. GST-HDAC7 and CMX-VP16-HDAC7 fusion constructs were generated by inserting HDAC7 polymerase chain reaction fragments into vector pGEX4T-1 and CMX-VP16, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuickChange kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). GST-MEF2A constructs have been previously described (33Lemercier C. Verdel A. Galloo B. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15594-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by stranded sequencing to confirm identity and reading frame. Monkey CV-1 cells, HeLa, NIH3T3, and MCF-7 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in 7% CO2. CV-1 cells (60–70% confluence, 48-well plate) were co-transfected with 16.6 to 66.6 ng of pCMXGAL4 and pCMXGAL4-HDAC constructs, 100 ng of pMH100-TK-Luc, and 100 ng of pCMX-LacZ in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum by theN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP)-mediated procedure (20Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by the addition of pCMX. After 24 h, the medium was replaced and the cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity 36–48 h after transfection. The luciferase activity was normalized by the level of β-galactosidase activity. Each transfection was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Mammalian two-hybrid assays were carried out as described (50Kao H.Y. Ordentlich P. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Tang Z. Downes M. Kintner C.R. Evans R.M. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2269-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well dishes (105 cells/well) and transfected 2 days later with Exgen 500 (Euromedex) according to the supplier's protocol. In each transfection, the DNA amount was kept constant with the pcDNA3 empty vector. Cell extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using the “Luciferase Assay System” (Promega) and the “luminescent β-gal detection kit (CLONTECH), respectively. One microgram of a plasmid containing a luciferase reporter gene cloned downstream of the myosin heavy chain minimal promoter flanked by two MEF2-binding sites was used to transfect HeLa cells (33Lemercier C. Verdel A. Galloo B. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15594-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Co-transfections were carried out with 200 ng of a MEF2A expression vector alone or together with the indicated amounts of HDAC7 expression vectors. 100 ng of a β-galactosidase expression vector were also used in each transfection. 24 h post-transfection, the luciferase activity was measured and normalized with respect to that of β-galactosidase. Forin situ immunofluorescence analysis, transfected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and permeabilized by the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated in a PBS/milk solution (5%) for 30 min. Incubation with primary antibodies was carried out overnight at 4 °C in the PBS/milk solution. The cells were washed three times in PBS at room temperature for 5 min incubated with the PBS/milk solution for 15 min before the addition of the secondary antibodies. The incubation was carried out for 45 min at 37 °C and the cells were washed and counterstained with Hoechst 33258. Slides were then mounted using an anti-fading solution. The preparations were observed under an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot) equipped with a 100 W mercury. Numeric image acquisitions were realized using a cooled CCD camera (C4880 Hamamatsu) mounted on the epifluorescence microscope. Three micrograms of CaMK I and 1 μg of YFP-HDAC7 were co-transfected into HeLa cells to detect the effect of CaMK I on the subcellular localization of HDAC7. For statistical analysis, a total of 100 cells were examined. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein was expressed inEscherichia coli DH5α strain and affinity purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. In vitro pull-down assays were carried out by incubating GST fusion proteins with35S-labeled MEF2s and HDACs generated in vitro.35S-Labeled proteins were generated using in vitro TNT (Promega). After extensive washes, protein sample buffer was added to retained fractions, boiled, and then separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. GST-MEF2 fusion proteins were produced in BL21 E. coli transformed with the pGEX-5X-3 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), encoding GST alone, or GST fused to various domains of MEF2A protein. 35S-Labeled HDAC7 and HDAC4 proteins were produced in rabbit reticulocyte lysate from pcDNA plasmids using the TNT transcription/translation kit and [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pull-down assays were performed as described by Lemercier et al. (33Lemercier C. Verdel A. Galloo B. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15594-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). MEF2C synthesizedin vitro was incubated with a 32P-labeled probe containing a MEF2C-binding site derived from the MCK promoter containing the sense strain sequence 5′-CGCTCTAAAAATAACCCT-3′. DNA-protein binding was conducted in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. After 30 min of incubation at 25 °C, the purified GST fusion proteins were added followed by an additional 30 min of incubation. The final reaction mixtures were loaded into a 6% polyacrylamide (29.2:0.8) nondenaturing gel followed by gel electrophoresis in 1 × TBE buffer. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. For co-immunoprecipitations, 293 cells on 15 × 15-cm plates were transfected with 15 μg of the appropriate plasmids using Targefect F1 (Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA). The cells were harvested after 48 h, washed with 1 × PBS, and resuspended in 2 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors. The cells were then sonicated and centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatants were kept as whole cell extract. After preclearing by incubation with A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz), immunoprecipitations were carried out using M2-agarose beads (Sigma) and proceeded for 2 h at 4 oC. After washing 3–4 times with resuspension buffer, the samples were boiled in SDS loading buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Two class II HDACs, HDAC4 and HDAC5, have been previously shown to interact with members of MEF2 transcription factors. Since HDAC7 shows certain degrees of sequence homology with these two deacetylases, we wondered whether it is also capable of interacting with MEF2 members. To test this hypothesis, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Expression vectors containing HA tagged-HDAC7 (HA-HDAC7) and FLAG-tagged-MEF2A, -C, and -D (FLAG-MEF2A, -C, and -D) were used to express these proteins either alone or together in 293 cells. Whole cell extracts were prepared and incubated with M2-agarose beads. After extensive washes, retained immunocomplexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analyses using anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the expression level of HA-HDAC7 was comparable in each transfected sample (lanes 2and 6–8). HA-HDAC7 can be co-precipitated only in the presence of MEF2A, -2C, and -2D (lanes 14–16). As a control, M2-agarose beads were unable to co-precipitate HA-HDAC7 in cell extracts containing only HA-HDAC7 (lane 2). To confirm these results, we carried out in situ co-localization experiments. Yellow fluorescenceprotein (YFP)-tagged HDAC7 and MEF2A were co-transfected into HeLa cells. After 24 h, the localization of both proteins was monitored. Consistent with previous reports, YFP-HDAC7 localized in specific nuclear cores referred to as matrixassociated deacetylase (MAD) bodies in HeLa cells. MEF2A was shown to completely co-localize with HDAC7 (Fig. 1 B). To map the MEF2 interaction domain of HDAC7, we used mammalian two-hybrid assays in CV-1 cells. The cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding Gal4-MEF2s and a series of VP16-HDAC7 fusion proteins and a luciferase reporter construct containing multiple copies of yeast Gal4-binding site cloned upstream from the TK promoter. An internal control plasmid constitutively expressing the β-galactosidase gene was also used. In contrast to SMRT, which binds to the deacetylase catalytic domain of class II HDACs, MEF2s associated with HDAC7 through the amino-terminal of HDAC7 (Fig. 1 C,lanes 10, 18, and 26). The MEF2s-interacting domain was further mapped to amino acid 72–172 of HDAC7 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 13, 21, and 29). Interestingly, this region is conserved among class II HDACs, HDAC4, -5, and -7. Other HDAC7 fragments could not interact with MEF2. Taken together, we conclude that amino acids 72–172 of HDAC7 were sufficient to interact with MEF2 in vivo. GST pull-down experiments were carried out to test whether HDAC7 could interact directly with MEF2s. GST-HDAC7 fusion peptides containing overlapping fragments were produced in bacteria and purified.35S-Labeled MEF2A, -C, and -D were synthesized in vitro and incubated with GST-HDAC7-coupled glutathione beads. Bound fractions were extensively washed and resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with the mammalian two-hybrid data, amino acids 72–172 of HDAC7 were found sufficient to interact with MEF2 (lanes 6, 13, and 20). To test whether HDAC7 could bind DNA-bound MEF2, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were conducted. In vitro translated MEF2C was incubated with a 32P-labeled probe containing the MEF2-binding site derived from MCK (muscle creatin kinase) promoter and the formation of the MEF2C-DNA complex was monitored. Consistent with previous reports, MEF2C bound to this sequence, resulting in the formation of a stable protein-DNA complex (Fig. 2 B,lane 2). As a control, incubation with a mock translation lysate did not lead to the formation of such a complex (lane 1). Furthermore, the addition of the GST protein alone did not have an effect on the DNA binding activity of MEF2C nor the mobility of the MEF2C-DNA complex (lane 3). Consistent with our pull-down and mammalian two-hybrid assays, addition of a GST-HDAC7 fusion protein spanning amino acids 72–172 resulted in the formation of a larger complex (lane 4), indicating the interaction of this region of HDAC7 with the MEF2C-DNA complex. Furthermore, GST fusion proteins containing other regions of HDAC7 did not modify the DNA binding activity of MEF2C nor the mobility of the MEF2C-DNA complex (lanes 5 and 6). Based on these results, we conclude that MEF2C can bind DNA and HDAC7 simultaneously and that binding of HDAC7 does not interfere with the MEF2C DNA binding activity. To determine the minimal HDAC7 interaction domain within MEF2s, we carried out an additional set of GST pull-down assays.35S-Labeled HDAC4 was also included as a control (Fig. 2 C, lane 7). We found that the affinity of HDAC7 for MEF2A was comparable to that of HDAC4 for this protein (lanes 1 and 7). We further mapped the HDAC7 interacting domain to the first 86 amino acids of MEF2A (lane 2). Taken together, we conclude that amino acids 72–172 of HDAC7 interacts directly with amino acids 1–86 of MEF2s. Based on the interaction data, we reasoned that the recruitment of HDAC7 by MEF2 could be a way to counteract the transactivator function of MEF2 members. To confirm this hypothesis, we fused MEF2C to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4. A reporter plasmid containing four copies of the Gal4-binding sites cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter and directing the expression of luciferase was used to monitor the transactivator capacity of MEF2C in this assay. While the expression of HDACs modestly activated the basal transcription of the reporter from 3–5-fold (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–7), the expression of HDAC7 significantly repressed MEF2C activity (lane 14). Furthermore, class I HDACs including HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 did not significantly affect MEF2C activity (lanes 9–11). In this assay, HDAC4 and HDAC5 repressed the MEF2C activity to the same extent as HDAC7 (lanes 12 and13). We have previously shown that the amino-terminal non-catalytic domain of HDAC7 possessed a strong repressor activity (20Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar) since HDAC7 containing point mutations D692A, D694A, and D692A/D694A that abrogated its HDAC activity could repress transcription efficiently (51Downes M. Ordentlich P. Kao H.Y. Alvarez J.G. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10330-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we reasoned that these mutants would also be able to repress MEF2 activity through the amino-terminal repressor domain. As shown in Fig. 3 B, these mutants efficiently repressed MEF2C activity albeit with slightly lower efficiency than the wild-type HDAC7. The difference is presumably due to the loss of their catalytic activity. These results further suggested that MEF2C binding does not interfere with the amino-terminal repression activity of HDAC7. In these assays the repression of MEF2 activity was independe"

In this study, the COX-2 constitutive expression vector was transfected into a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line CL1.0 and several clones were obtained which stably expressed COX-2. These COX-2-overexpressed clones demonstrated remarkable resistance to apoptosis induced by Ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation, vinblastine B (VBL) cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), or other anti-cancer drugs. To understand how COX-2 prevents apoptosis, the investigators examined the expression level of Bcl-2 family members. Mcl-1, but not other Bcl-2 members, was significantly up-regulated by COX-2 transfection or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) treatment. Treatment of COX-2-overexpressed cells (cox-2/cl.4) with two specific COX-2 inhibitors, NS-398 and celecoxib, caused an effective reduction of the increased level of Mcl-1. These data suggest that the expression level of Mcl-1 is tightly regulated by COX-2. Moreover, transfection of cox-2/cl.4 cells with antisense Mcl-1 enhanced apoptosis induced by UVB irradiation, revealing that Mcl-1 plays a crucial role in cell survival activity mediated by COX-2. Furthermore, COX-2 transfection or PGE2 treatment evidently activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway by LY294002 or wortmannin effectively attenuated the increased level of Mcl-1 induced by COX-2 or PGE2. Blocking the PI3K activity with a dominant-negative vector, DN-p85, also greatly diminished the level of Mcl-1 and enhanced UVB-elicited cell death in cells transfected by COX-2. In a similar way, LY294002 inhibited cell survival and Mcl-1 level in PGE2-treated CL1.0 cells. These findings suggest that COX-2 promotes cell survival by up-regulating the level of Mcl-1 by activating the PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway.

Two COX isoforms have been identified, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed constitutively, whereas COX-2 is induced by growth factors, tumor promoters, and cytokines (1Taketo M.M. J. Natl.

The increased expression of COX-2 has been reported to correlate with the malignant changes observed in a variety of human cancers, including colorectal, gastric, esophageal, brain, and lung tumors (5Sano H.

In lung tumorigenesis, administrating a specific COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, clearly prevented carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK)-induced lung tumors in A/J mice (9Rioux N.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4997-5001PubMed Google Scholar) detected a markedly higher COX-2 expression in human lung adenocarcinomas but a lower expression in squamous cell carcinomas or small cell lung cancers. These results indicate that incremental COX-2 expression is critical for pathogenic alteration during the development of human lung cancer. Inappropriate induction of apoptosis has been associated with organ injury, whereas a failure to undergo apoptosis may cause abnormal cell growth and lead to certain malignant phenotypes, e.g. tumor invasion and metastasis (11Nicolson G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 175-224PubMed Google Scholar, 12Noel A. Gilles C. Bajou K. Devy L. Kebers F. Lewalle J.M. Maquoi E. Munaut C. Remacle A. Foidart J.M. Invasion Metastasis. 1997; 17: 221-239PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing tumorigenic potential by COX-2 overexpression has been suggested to be associated with resistance to apoptosis (13Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). Exposing HCA-7 colon cancer cells to a COX-2 inhibitor, SC-58125, inhibited growth and increased apoptotic cells, which PGE2 stimulation reversed (14Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibiting COX-2 activity by SC-58236 or down-regulation of the COX-2 protein by antisense expression in medullary interstitial cells apparently causes an apoptosis (15Hao C.M. Komhoff M. Guan Y. Redha R. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F352-F359PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the above data suggest that COX-2 may function as a survival factor by protecting cells from apoptosis. However, no researchers have discovered the detailed mechanisms underlying how COX-2 induces certain downstream effector genes to prevent apoptosis. Because COX-2 is selectively expressed in human lung adenocarcinomas, this study investigated whether COX-2 would alter the cellular sensitivity to apoptosis and the possible action mechanism in a human lung adenocarcinoma CL1.0 cell line. To address this issue, the COX-2 expression vector was transfected into CL1.0 cells, and several stable clones overexpressing COX-2 were obtained. These stable clones displayed a substantial level of Mcl-1 protein and exhibited a remarkable resistance to apoptosis. Interestingly, exposure of CL1.0 cells with PGE2 also caused an up-regulation of the Mcl-1 protein as well as an increase in anti-apoptotic activity. Transient transfection of antisense Mcl-1 into COX-2 overexpressed cells caused them to be more susceptible to cytotoxicity induced by UV irradiation. Further experiments examined the role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in COX-2- or PGE2-mediated Mcl-1 up-regulation and anti-apoptotic activity. Human lung adenocarcinoma cell line CL1.0 was cultured as previously described (16Chu Y.W. Yang P.C. Yang S.C. Shyu Y.C. Hendrix M.J. Wu R. Wu C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). CL1.0 cells accurately expressing the COX-2 were established by transfection with a COX-2 constitutive expression vector, pSG5-Cox-2, employing the TransFastTM transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). After 48 h of transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum and 300 μg/ml hygromycin B. Hygromycin B-resistant clones were selected and expanded. The level of COX-2 and COX-1 was determined by Western blotting. 5 × 104 cells/well of different stable COX-2-overexpressed clones (cox-2/cl.2, cox-2/cl.4, and cox-2/cl.17) were plated in 6-well dishes and grown to a 60–70% confluence in growth medium by 24 h. Then the culture medium was collected with an enzyme immunoassay to verify amounts of PGE2 secreted by these stable clones. The production of PGE2 was standardized to protein concentrations. COX-2-overexpressing CL1.0 cells (cox-2/cl.4) were plated 24 h before transfection at a density of 5 × 104cells onto a clover glass. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of antisense Mcl-1 plasmid (pcDNA3-mcl-1-AS) or control plasmid (pcDNA3) utilizing TransFastTM transfection reagent. Transfections were performed in triplicate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, transfected cells were changed to a serum-free medium for a further 12 h and were then treated with UVB irradiation (100 mJ/cm2) or none. After treatment, the extent of apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assays with the In Situ Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptotic cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The DNA fragmentation on agarose gel electrophoresis was detected as described previously (17Kuo M.L. Chuang S.E. Lin M.T. Yang S.Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cellular lysates were prepared as described previously (18Jee S.H. Shen S.C. Chiu H.C. Tsai W.L. Kuo M.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A 50–100-μg sample of each lysate was subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The samples were then electroblotted on nitrocellulose paper. After blocking, blots were incubated with anti-Mcl-1, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-COX-1, anti-COX-2 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-Akt, and anti-phospho-Akt (New England BioLabs) antibodies in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline within 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h followed by two washes (15 min each) in PBST. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were employed to depict the protein bands on membranes. PI3-kinase activities were assayed as described previously (19Chen R.H. Chang M.C. Su Y.H. Tsai Y.T. Kuo M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23013-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 cells received different treatments and were washed twice with ice cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 mm lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 2 mm orthovanadate). Cell extracts were incubated with 1 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was precipitated with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with LiCl buffer (0.5 m LiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6), and twice with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA). The immunocomplex was preincubated with 10 μl of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), containing 2 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) on ice for 10 min. Kinase reaction was performed by adding 40 μl of reaction buffer (10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20 μm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2) at room temperature for 15 min. Adding 100 μl of 1 m HCl extracted with 200 μl of a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and methanol stopped the reaction. The radiolabeled lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography and visualized by phosphorimaging. CL1.0 cells were plated 24 h before transfection at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Cells were co-transfected with pCMV-β-gal plasmid (1 μg), which expressed β-galactosidase, and plasmids (4 μg) containing the COX-2 (pSG5-Cox-2), DN-p85, or pcDNA3 control vector utilizing the TransFastTM transfection reagent. Transfections were performed in triplicate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cell medium was replaced with a fresh serum-free medium for 12 h and then exposed to 100 mJ/cm2 UVB or none. Cells were washed after treatment and fixed in PBS containing 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. These cells were washed twice more with PBS, resuspended in staining solution containing PBS (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm K4Fe (CN)6, 10 mm K3He(CN)6, and 1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; added just before use) for 4–24 h, and washed twice with PBS. The β-galactosidase-positive cells (blue living cells) in each well were counted. The human COX-2 constitutive expression plasmid, pSG5-Cox-2, and the control vector were transfected into human adenocarcinoma CL1.0 cells, which have a relatively low level of COX-2 protein. This action was aimed at determining whether alteration of the COX-2 level would change the cellular sensitivity to apoptosis. After transfection, cells were cultured in a medium containing 300 μg/ml hygromycin B. Each colony that grew after hygromycin selection was picked and expended. Western blot analysis revealed that three stable colonies (cox-2/cl.2, cox-2/cl.4, and cox-2/cl.17) were randomly selected and expressed a 4–6-fold increase of COX-2 protein compared with the vector control cells (Fig.1A). The level of COX-1 protein in these transfectants and control cells remained unaltered (Fig. 1A). Elevated levels of PGE2 production, assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1B), paralleled the increased expression of COX-2 protein in the human lung cancer CL1.0 cells. This implies that the exogenously overexpressed COX-2 displayed enzymatic activities in CL1.0 cells. To investigate a possible role of COX-2 in cell survival, these COX-2-overexpressed cells were treated with different apoptosis-inducing agents. Fig.2A reveals that all the COX-2-overexpressed cells (cox-2/cl.2, cox-2/cl.4, and cox-2/cl.17) displayed a remarkable resistance to vinblastine (VBL)-induced apoptosis, as agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA laddering demonstrated. In contrast, vector control cells were highly susceptible to VBL treatment. The apoptosis-resistant characteristic of these COX-2-overexpressed cells was also noted after treatment with other anti-cancer drugs such as paclitaxel or topotecan (not displayed). Apoptotic cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 fluorescent dye (i.e. chromatin condensation and nuclear segmentation) as an additional apoptosis assessment. Fig. 2B demonstrates that the cox-2/cl.4 cells had fewer apoptotic cells than the vector control cells when exposed to UVB irradiation (100 mJ/cm2). Few if any apoptotic cells could be detected in cox-2/cl.4 or control cells without UVB exposure (data not displayed). Exposure of parental CL1.0 cells to 1–4 μg/ml PGE2 consistently resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in apoptotic cells induced by UVB irradiation compared with cells in the absence of PGE2, as determined by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 2C). These findings indicate that overexpression of COX-2 or its elevated product, PGE2, renders cells more resistant to apoptosis stresses. The expression level of the Bcl-2 family proteins was first examined to identify the possible downstream gene(s) regulated by COX-2 or PGE2. Fig.3A reveals that the level of Mcl-1 protein was significantly increased by ∼3–4-fold in cox-2/cl.2 and cl.4 stable clones compared with the vector control cells. In contrast, the levels of other Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 were only slightly affected either in COX-2 stable clones or control cells. We further examined whether the level of Mcl-1 protein in cox-2/cl.4 cells would be altered by treatment with COX-2 inhibitors. Fig. 3B shows, under the noncytotoxic dose, that both celecoxib (10 μm) and NS-398 (25 μm) strongly diminished the endogenous level of Mcl-1 in the COX-2 stable clone. Under the same circumstance, both inhibitors could inhibit the level of PGE2, an indicator for COX-2 activity, in COX-2-overexpressed cells by 70–80% (data not shown). To exclude the possibility that an artificial drug selection enhanced anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein in these COX-2 stable clones, investigators transfected CL1.0 cells with COX-2 expression vector or treated them with various concentrations of PGE2 and then examined the expression of Mcl-1 protein. Western blot analysis revealed that CL1.0 cells displayed an apparent dose-dependent increase in Mcl-1 protein (∼4–8-fold) when transfection occurred with the 2 or 4 μg of pSG5-Cox-2 vector but not with the control vector, pSG5 (Fig. 3C). A commonly used liposomal transfection method achieved a high transfection efficiency of >40% in the human adenocarcinoma CL1.0 cells (not displayed). CL1.0 cells were treated next with 4 μg/ml PGE2 for various periods of time, and then the change of Mcl-1 protein level was detected by Western blotting. Fig.3D clearly demonstrates that the level of Mcl-1 protein rapidly increased 1 h after PGE2 treatment, peaked at 3–6 h, and then maintained a high level of Mcl-1 over 12 h. In contrast, the level of Bcl-2 protein was little affected during the PGE2 treatment. These results suggest that COX-2 overexpression or PGE2 elevated the Mcl-1level in CL1.0 cells but not other Bcl-2 family members. The COX-2-overexpressed cells (cox-2/cl.4) were transfected with a constitutive antisense Mcl-1 expression vector to further investigate the role of Mcl-1 in COX-2-mediated anti-apoptotic activity. However, following several rounds of stable clone selection, none of the clones that survived could express antisense Mcl-1. This probably occurred because of the severely cytotoxic effect of the constitutive antisense Mcl-1 expression. A transient transfection death assay was therefore conducted to investigate this phenomenon. Cox-2/cl.4 cells were initially transfected with empty vectors or antisense Mcl-1 vectors. Twenty-four hours after transfection, transfected cells were changed to a serum-free medium for a further 12 h and were then treated with UVB irradiation (100 mJ/cm2) or none. After treatment, the extent of apoptosis was defined as the number of cells positively stained with TUNEL and identified under a fluorescence microscope. Fig.4A reveals that cox-2/cl.4 cells displayed a resistant phenotype to UVB-induced apoptosis when transfected with a control vector or none. Transfection of cox-2/cl.4 cells with antisense Mcl-1enhanced apoptotic cell death induced by UVB irradiation. Under the same circumstances, the antisense Mcl-1 vector effectively attenuated the endogenous level of Mcl-1 in cox-2/cl.4 cells by transfection (Fig. 4B). The above results strongly suggest that the mcl-1 gene is critically involved in the COX-2-mediated anti-apoptotic effect in human adenocarcinoma CL1.0 cells. Because the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a central role in integrating a diverse survival signal triggered by numerous growth factors (20Kelley T.J. Cotton C.U. Drumm M.L. Am. J.

To evaluate this, the endogenous Akt activity in cox-2/cl.2 and cox-2/cl.4 cells was examined by determining the serine-phosphorylated status of Akt, employing an anti-phospho-Akt antibody. The Akt activity correlates well with the phosphorylation of Akt molecules on serine 473 (23Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these COX-2-overexpressed cells displayed a significantly increased Akt phosphorylation over the vector control cells (Fig.5A). Furthermore, treatment with a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (10 μm), greatly reduced the phosphorylation of Akt in these COX-2 expressed cells (Fig.5A). This indicates that PI3K functions upstream of Akt in response to the COX-2-elicited survival signal. The authentic PI3K activity of CL1.0 cells after treatment with PGE2 was subsequently determined. Immunoprecipitates with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody revealed a substantial increase in PI3K activity 15–60 min after exposure to 4 μg/ml PGE2, and 10 μm LY294002 could completely inhibit this increase (Fig. 5B). The above results suggest that the PI3K/Akt pathway is indeed activated by COX-2 or its product, PGE2. The next aim of the investigation was to ascertain whether PI3K activity inhibition might affect the anti-apoptotic activity and Mcl-1 up-regulation induced by COX-2 or PGE2. To address this issue, a COX-2 vector and a dominant-negative form of the regulatory subunit of PI3K, DN-p85, were concomitantly transfected into CL1.0 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that DN-p85 completely attenuated COX-2-mediated Mcl-1 up-regulation (Fig.6A). Utilizing an anti-hemagglutinin antibody (data not shown) or detecting the serine phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 6B) confirmed the successful expression of the DN-p85 in transfected cells. To determine the effect of DN-p85 on COX-2-mediated cell survival, a transient transfection death assay was conducted employing the β-galactosidase expression plasmid (pCMV-β-gal) as a survival marker. The transfection results revealed that the DN-p85 transfection, but not the control pcDNA3, abolished the COX-2-induced cell survival activity when exposed to UVB irradiation, as determined by the decrease of blue surviving cells expressing β-galactosidase activity (Fig.6C). A similar observation was made in CL1.0 cells treated with PGE2. Fig. 7Areveals that PGE2-induced Mcl-1 up-regulation was almost completely attenuated in the presence of LY294002 or wortmannin. Also, LY294002 treatment greatly sensitized PGE2-treated cells to UVB irradiation-elicited apoptosis as determined by a TUNEL assay (Fig.7B). The above data clearly reveal that COX-2-mediated cell survival activity requires activation of the PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway and its subsequent downstream gene, mcl-1. Accumulating evidence has suggested that cancer cells expressing higher levels of COX-2 may obtain a survival advantage that eventually facilitates the tumor development and progression. Although these studies have established a direct relationship between COX-2 expression and cell survival in different cell systems, the precise mechanism by which COX-2 prevents cell death has seldom been investigated and remains elusive. This study demonstrated that COX-2 overexpression or PGE2 treatment induced an increase in a novel anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 through the PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway in human adenocarcinoma cells. An antisense Mcl-1 transfection assay ensured a crucial role for Mcl-1 in the COX-2-mediated anti-apoptotic effect in lung adenocarcinoma CL1.0 cells. Other researchers distinctly observed that either forced expression of COX-2 in intestinal cells (13Tsujii M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar) or PGE2 exposure (14Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar) to colon cancer cells caused up-regulation of the Bcl-2 protein. The level of Bcl-2 protein, however, was unchanged in our cell system, suggesting induction of certain members of the Bcl-2 family by COX-2, depending upon the cell context. The mcl-1 gene, one of the Bcl-2 family members, was originally identified as an early gene induced during differentiation of ML-1 myeloid leukemia cells (24Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Mcl-1 delays apoptosis induced by a broad array of agents such as c-Myc overexpression, growth factor withdrawal and other cytotoxic agents (17Kuo M.L. Chuang S.E. Lin M.T. Yang S.Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Chao J.R. Wang J.M. Lee S.F. Peng H.W. Lin Y.H. Chou C.H. Li J.C. Huang H.M. Chou C.K. Kuo M.L. Yen J.J.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6348-6352PubMed Google Scholar). These findings correspond to our current data, suggesting that certain types of cancer cells require Mcl-1 to survive. Many cytokines and growth factors have already been reported as able to induce Mcl-1 expression (27Moulding D.A. Quayle J.A. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 2495-2502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this is first time it has been demonstrated that the COX-2-derived prostanoids can do so. COX-2 has been reported to inhibit nerve growth factor withdrawal apoptosis in differentiated PC12 cells (28McGinty A. Chang Y.W. Sorokin A. Bokemeyer D. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12095-12101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A different study found that an apoptosis-related gene, dynein light chain (DLC), was up-regulated in PC12 cells by COX-2 expression or PGE2treatment (29Chang Y.W. Jakobi R. McGinty A. Foschi M. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). DLC expression prevented apoptosis of PC12 cells by reducing neuron nitric-oxide synthase activity. Themcl-1 and DLC genes are the only two downstream effectors responsible for COX-2-mediated anti-apoptotic signal identified thus far. This investigation also revealed that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway could be activated and involved in Mcl-1 up-regulation by COX-2 expression or PGE2. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway promotes growth-mediated cell survival and restricts apoptosis by modifying the anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic activities of members of the bcl-2gene family (20Kelley T.J. Cotton C.U. Drumm M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L990-L996PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kim B.C. Lee M.N. Kim J.Y. Lee S.S. Chang J.D. Kim S.S. Lee S.Y. Kim J.H. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). Interestingly, celecoxib, a specific COX-2 inhibitor, has been found to promote apoptosis in human prostatic cancer cells by attenuating the Akt activity but not the level of Bcl-2 protein (30Hsu A.L. Ching T.T. Wang D.S. Song X. Rangnekar V.M. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11397-11403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). This implies that the Akt-related pathway is important for COX-2-induced anti-apoptotic activity but that it might be dissociated from the expression of Bcl-2 protein. Our previous studies (17Kuo M.L. Chuang S.E. Lin M.T. Yang S.Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 31Wang J.M. Chao J.R. Chen W. Kuo M.L. Yen J.J. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6195-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have pointed out that the anti-apoptotic mcl-1gene, but not bcl-2, is a direct downstream target of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway induced by interleukin-6 or -3. The cells overexpressing an activated Akt, Myr-Akt, also augmented the expression of Mcl-1 but not Bcl-2 (17Kuo M.L. Chuang S.E. Lin M.T. Yang S.Y. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A recent study has also demonstrated that PGE2 treatment activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is required to increase growth and motility in colon carcinoma cells (32Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). How do COX-2-derived prostanoids, e.g. PGE2, activate the PI3K? Two classes of prostaglandin receptors transduce signals upon binding of the ligand, the G-coupled cytoplasmic receptor class (i.e. EP1–4 for PGE2) and the nuclear PPAR receptor class (i.e. PPARα, PPARδ, PPARγ), which acts directly as a transcription factor upon ligand binding (33Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Many studies have demonstrated that the receptor-coupled G protein can transduce the signal to the PI3K (34Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Logically, the cytoplasmic EP receptors are the preferred mediator for the prostanoid-induced PI3K/Akt-dependent cell survival effect. Further investigation will be needed to determine whether the EP receptor or PPAR receptor is involved in the anti-apoptotic activity by COX-2-derived prostanoids. Although COX-2 expression is thought to be crucial for the development of certain human cancers, the downstream signal that mediates the neoplastic effects is poorly understood. The current investigation has revealed that either overexpression of COX-2 or exposure to PGE2 can increase the apoptosis threshold in human lung adenocarcinoma cells by up-regulating the mcl-1 gene. It also found the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to be involved in regulating Mcl-1 expression. This work verifies a new downstream agent of COX-2. That verification will help researchers to understand better the precise mechanism of the COX-2-mediated carcinogenic process. We thank Dr. H.-F. Yang-Yen for helpful instructions on the PI3K assay and Dr. R.-H. Chen for providing dominant-negative Akt and p85. We also acknowledge Ted Knoy for his critical editing of the manuscript."

Recently, we identified a negative regulator of the NEDD8 conjugation system, NUB1, which interacts with NEDD8 and down-regulates NEDD8 expression post-transcriptionally (Kito, K., Yeh, E. T. H., and Kamitani, T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 20603–20609). Here, we show that NUB1 possesses a ubiquitin-like domain at the N-terminal region and binds to S5a of the 19 S proteasome activator (PA700). A GST pull-down assay revealed that the overexpression of NUB1 leads to a greater precipitation of NEDD8 conjugates with GST-S5a, suggesting that NUB1 might have an adaptor function between S5a and NEDD8. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitors completely block NUB1-mediated down-regulation of NEDD8 expression. These results suggest that NUB1 recruits NEDD8 and its conjugates to the proteasome for degradation, providing a direct functional link between the NEDD8 conjugation system and the proteasomal degradation pathway.

NEDD8 has been shown to conjugate to a large number of nuclear proteins (1Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). NEDD8 conjugation is thought to be catalyzed by three enzymes, termed E1 (NEDD8-activating), E2 (NEDD8-conjugating), and E3 (NEDD8-ligating), in a manner analogous to ubiquitination and sentrinization (also known as SUMO conjugation) (2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 3Gong L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). All of the known NEDD8 targets in mammalian cells are cullin family members, including Cul-1, -2, -3, -4A, -4B, and -5 (5Kipreos E.T. Lander L.E. Wing J.P. He W.W. Hedgecock E.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 6Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Human Cul-1 is a major component of ubiquitin ligase known as a SCF complex that catalyzes the ubiquitination of IκBα, β-catenin, and p27 (Kip1) (7Pagano M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 8Lisztwan J. Marti A. Sutterluety H. Gstaiger M. Wirbelauer C. Krek W.

Interestingly, NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-1 is required for the ubiquitin ligase activity of the SCF complex (10Read M.A. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Hottelet M. Parent L.A. Coggins M.B. Pierce J.W.

Pierce J.W. Lightcap E.S. Chau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4579-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This finding implies that NEDD8 modifies the molecular function of other cullin family members as well as Cul-1. Thus, NEDD8 conjugation could be involved in many important biological functions, and its conjugation and deconjugation systems have to be strictly regulated. Recently, we tried to define the unknown regulators of NEDD8 conjugation using a yeast two-hybrid system with NEDD8 as a bait. From the library screening, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding a novel NEDD8-interacting protein, NUB1. We demonstrated that NUB1 overexpression leads to severe inhibition of NEDD8 expression by a post-transcriptional mechanism (12Kito K. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20603-20609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, NUB1 acts as a strong down-regulator of NEDD8 conjugation. In this report, we describe the mechanism of action by which NUB1 down-regulates NEDD8 expression. Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells and cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

To remove the reactivity to GST and the cross-reactivity to ubiquitin, the purified antibody was absorbed with GST-ubiquitin immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After the immunoabsorption, the anti-NEDD8 antibody was used for Western blotting. To express proteins tagged with epitope at the N terminus in mammalian cells, pcDNA3/HA-N (13Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P.

The cDNA of EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pEGFP-1 (CLONTECH) using appropriate primers. These cDNAs were inserted into the aforementioned plasmid vectors. The sequence of each cDNA was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into COS-M6 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transfected cells were harvested for Western blotting 20 h after transfection. N-Acetyl-l-leucinal-l-leucinal-l-norleucinal was purchased from Sigma. MG132 and lactacystin were purchased from Calbiochem. 1 × 106 COS-M6 cells were transfected by FuGENE 6. After overnight culture, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing proteasome inhibitor such asN-acetyl-l-leucinal-l-leucinal-l-norleucinal (LLnL) (50 μm), MG132 (40 μm), or lactacystin (20 μm). The transfectants were cultured at 37 °C with these proteasome inhibitors for 6 h. Then the cells were harvested, and the total cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis. Protein samples were treated at 45 °C for 1 h in 150 μl of 2% SDS treating solution containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. After SDS-PAGE, Western blotting was performed using the protocol provided with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against mouse IgG or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used. The ubiquitin-like domain was determined by the ProfileScan program via the World Wide Web. The cDNAs of ubiquitin, NEDD8, sentrin-1 (SUMO-1), sentrin-2 (SUMO-3/SMT3B), and sentrin-3 (SUMO-2/SMT3A) were inserted to a prokaryotic expression plasmid pTrcHisA (Invitrogen).Escherichia coli BL21 cells were transformed with these plasmids. Transformed cells were grown logarithmically (A 600 = 0.8) in 2 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Then the expression of His6-tagged ubiquitin-like proteins was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature for 2.5 h. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 150 μl of TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl), followed by sonication for 15 s. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with 150 μl of TBS buffer and incubated with 15 μl of TALON bead suspension (CLONTECH) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with TBS buffer and used for in vitro binding assay to examine the interaction between His6-tagged ubiquitin-like proteins and NUB1. The recombinant NUB1 protein was prepared by protease digestion of GST-NUB1 fusion protein. The NUB1 cDNA was inserted into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-NUB1 was expressed in BL21 cells and purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (16Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22307-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The fusion protein bound to beads was then digested for 5 h at room temperature in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) containing factor Xa (Novagen, Madison, WI). After enzymatic digestion, the bead suspension was centrifuged to remove the beads. The protein concentration of NUB1 was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) and diluted to 50 ng/ml using TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Finally, His6-tagged ubiquitin-like proteins immobilized on TALON beads were incubated in this protein solution containing 50 ng/ml of NUB1 for 5 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed with TBS buffer five times and treated with sample treating buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The protein samples were analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit anti-NUB1 antibody. The cDNA of S5a was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using appropriate primers from human testis cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) and inserted into pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs) to make pMAL/S5a.E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with plasmids pMAL-c2 and pMAL/S5a. Recombinant proteins MBP and MBP-S5a were purified from the lysate of the BL21 cells by amylose resin beads and eluted using the protocol provided by New England Biolabs. MBP and MBP-S5a were used for the GST pull-down assay as described previously (17Wada H. Kito K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

These proteasome fractions were derived from rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Approximately 0.7 μg of protein of each fraction was solubilized in 2% SDS treating solution and loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel, followed by Western blotting analysis. To show the co-fractionation of NUB1 or NEDD8 conjugates in proteasome fraction, rabbit anti-NUB1 antibody (12Kito K. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol.

In addition to proteasome fractions, total cell lysates of HeLa cells (NUB1-expressing cell line) and U2OS cells (cell line with undetectable NUB1 expression) (12Kito K. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20603-20609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were examined as controls. COS-M6 cells were transfected with empty vector or plasmid DNA encoding FLAG-tagged ubiquitin, NEDD8, or sentrin-2. After overnight culture, transfectants were treated with 20 μmof MG132 for 4 h, followed by the preparation of total cell lysate in TBS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 20 μm MG132, 0.2% Nonidet P-40). The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant was incubated with GST or GST-S5a immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the beads were washed five times with TBS buffer. Precipitated proteins were solubilized in 2% SDS treating solution at 45 °C for 1 h and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody. The GST-S5a fusion protein was generated by pGEX-2TK/S5a. The S5a cDNA was inserted into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-S5a was expressed in BL21 cells and purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (16Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22307-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To investigate how NUB1 affects NEDD8 expression, we first used the COS cell coexpression assay. HA-tagged NEDD8 was coexpressed in COS cells with empty vector (control), RH-tagged NUB1, or EGFP (control). Further controls were created by coexpression of HA-tagged ubiquitin or sentrin-2 (SUMO-3/SMT3B) with empty vector, RH-tagged NUB1, or EGFP. As shown in the upper panel of Fig.1 A, when HA-NEDD8 was coexpressed with empty vector (lane 2) or RH-EGFP (lane 4), a 7-kDa band of unconjugated HA-NEDD8 and high molecular mass bands of HA-NEDD8-conjugated proteins were strongly detected. This NEDD8 expression pattern was identical to the pattern we found in our previous study (1Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). When HA-NEDD8 was coexpressed with RH-NUB1 (lane 3), the same bands were detected, but they were much weaker than those of lanes 2 and 4. This result indicated that NUB1 inhibits the expression of NEDD8 monomer and its conjugates. In contrast, when HA-ubiquitin (lane 6) or HA-sentrin-2 (lane 9) was coexpressed with RH-NUB1, overexpression of NUB1 did not lead to reduction of ubiquitination or sentrinization. Thus, the down-regulation by NUB1 was specific to the NEDD8 conjugation system. Next, we confirmed that NUB1 affects the expression of NEDD8 monomer by using a NEDD8 mutant, NEDD8-G, which has a C-terminal deletion from Gly-76 to Gln-81 and is unable to form conjugates with target proteins (1Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As a control, we used a sentrin-2 mutant, sentrin-2-G, which has a similar C-terminal deletion from Gly-93 to Tyr-95 and is unable to form conjugates with target proteins (14Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11349-11353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As shown in the upper panel of Fig.1 B, overexpression of RH-NUB1 strongly reduced the protein expression of HA-NEDD8-G (lane 2 versus lane 3) but not HA-sentrin-2-G (lane 4 versus lane 5). This finding confirmed that NUB1 also specifically reduced the protein expression of the unconjugated form of NEDD8. NUB1 was originally isolated by yeast two-hybrid system using NEDD8 as a bait, indicating that NUB1 interacts with NEDD8 directly or indirectlyin vivo. In Fig. 1, we showed that the effect of NUB1 overexpression was specific to NEDD8, suggesting a specific interaction of NUB1 with NEDD8. To examine whether NUB1 interacts with NEDD8 directly or indirectly and whether the interaction is specific to NEDD8 or not, an in vitro interaction assay was performed. We expressed poly-His-tagged ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, including NEDD8, sentrin-1 (SUMO-1), sentrin-2 (SUMO-3/SMT3B), and sentrin-3 (SUMO-2/SMT3A), in bacteria and purified the proteins using TALON beads (Fig. 2 A,upper panel). Then the bead-immobilized proteins were used for a pull-down assay of NUB1. As shown in thelower panel of Fig. 2 A, NUB1 was precipitated with poly-His-tagged NEDD8 but not with ubiquitin, sentrin-1, sentrin-2, or sentrin-3. Thus, NUB1 showed the direct interaction specific to NEDD8 in vitro. NUB1 is composed of 601 residues and has a calculated molecular mass of 69.1 kDa. It possesses several domains, including two coiled coils, two ubiquitin-associated domains, a bipartite nuclear localization signal, and a PEST sequence (12Kito K. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20603-20609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, we found an additional domain in NUB1, called the ubiquitin-like domain, that represents a new class of proteasome-interacting motif (18Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The domain was located at the N-terminal region of NUB1 from Ile-85 to Val-147 between two coiled coil regions. So far, the ubiquitin-like domain has been characterized well in Rad23 and BAG-1. Rad23 interacts with S5a, a subunit of the 19 S proteasome activator (19DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22123-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), through an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain. The C terminus of Rad23 binds to the Rad4 DNA repair protein and creates a link between the DNA repair and proteasome pathways (18Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar,20Hiyama H. Yokoi M. Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Maekawa T. Tanaka K. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28019-28025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). BAG-1 also possesses a ubiquitin-like domain at its N-terminal region that provides a physical link between the molecular chaperones Hsc70/Hsp70 and the proteasome (21Lüders J. Demand J. Höhfeld J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Since NUB1 also possessed a ubiquitin-like domain at its N-terminal region, we hypothesized that NUB1 interacts with the S5a subunit of 19 S proteasome activator through its ubiquitin-like domain. To confirm this hypothesis, we performed a GST pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 2 B(lanes 1 and 2), GST and GST-fused NUB1 were expressed in bacteria and purified with glutathione beads. Using these protein-coated beads, we precipitated recombinant MBP (maltose-binding protein) or MBP-fused S5a. As shown in Fig.2 B (lanes 3 and 4), GST beads could not precipitate MBP-S5a or MBP. GST-NUB1 precipitated MBP-S5a but not MBP. This result indicated that NUB1 directly interacts with S5a, a subunit of the 19 S proteasome activator. On the basis of the interaction between NUB1 and S5a, we predicted that NUB1 is associated with 19 S proteasome activator through S5a. To examine this, we performed Western blotting to detect NUB1 in 26 S proteasome (19 S + 20 S) and 20 S proteasome purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate. As positive and negative controls, we used total cell lysates of human HeLa cells and U2OS cells, respectively. As shown in the upper panel of Fig.3 A, NUB1 could be detected in the fraction of 26 S proteasome (lane 3) but not in the fraction of 20 S proteasome (lane 4). Since 26 S proteasome is composed of 19 S proteasome activator and 20 S proteasome, this result suggested that NUB1 is associated with 19 S proteasome activator, perhaps through its affinity for S5a. Interestingly, NUB1 in the 26 S proteasome fraction was 80–90 kDa in size (lane 3), which was 15–20 kDa bigger than the expected size of NUB1 (lane 1). The NUB1 in 26 S proteasome fraction might be modified, which explains the size difference. Since NUB1, which interacts with NEDD8, is co-fractionated with the 19 S proteasome activator, we predicted that NEDD8 and its conjugates are also associated with the 19 S proteasome activator through NUB1. To examine the association, we generated an NEDD8-specific antibody (Fig.3 B) and performed Western blotting to detect NEDD8 and its conjugates in the proteasome fraction. As shown in Fig. 3 C, we detected NEDD8 conjugates but not NEDD8 monomer in the 26 S proteasome fraction. Neither the monomer nor the conjugated form of NEDD8 could be detected in 20 S proteasome. These results suggested that NEDD8 conjugates are associated with the 19 S proteasome activator. In this experiment, the NEDD8 monomer could not be detected in the fraction of the 26 S proteasome. The NEDD8 monomer might be rapidly degraded by proteasome (see below). In Fig. 3, we demonstrated that NEDD8 conjugates are co-fractionated with the 19 S proteasome activator. To explain this co-fractionation, there are three possibilities. The first possibility is that NEDD8 directly binds to S5a of the 19 S proteasome activator. The second possibility is that NUB1 is an adaptor between S5a of the 19 S proteasome activator and NEDD8 conjugates. The third possibility is that S5a interacts with the NUB1-NEDD8 complex by mutual binding. To examine these possibilities, we overexpressed FLAG-tagged NEDD8 in COS cells (Fig. 4 A). As shown in lane 3, FLAG-NEDD8-expressing cell lysate revealed 6.5-kDa NEDD8 monomer and higher molecular mass NEDD8 conjugates. These proteins were examined by GST pull-down assay using GST or GST-S5a immobilized on glutathione beads. GST did not precipitate any proteins (lane 7), whereas GST-S5a precipitated a trace amount of NEDD8 conjugates but not NEDD8 monomer (lane 11). As positive and negative controls, FLAG-ubiquitin and FLAG-sentrin-2 were expressed in COS cells (lanes 2 and 4) and pulled down with GST-S5a (lanes 10 and 12), respectively. GST-S5a precipitated ubiquitinated proteins (lane 10) but not sentrinized proteins (lane 12). These results support the second or third possibility described above. Next, we examined the effect of NUB1 overexpression on the association of NEDD8 conjugates with S5a (Fig. 4 B). FLAG-NEDD8 was coexpressed in COS cells with empty vector (lane 3) or RH-tagged NUB1 (lane 4), followed by precipitation with GST-S5a-coated beads. As controls, empty vector (lanes 1 and 2), FLAG-tagged sentrin-2 (lanes 5 and 6), and ubiquitin (lanes 7 and 8) were expressed and analyzed by the same method. As shown in lanes 3 and 4, NEDD8 conjugates could be more effectively precipitated by GST-S5a when NUB1 was coexpressed. In comparison, sentrin and sentrinized proteins could not be precipitated even when NUB1 was coexpressed (lane 6). Although ubiquitinated proteins could be precipitated, no effect of NUB1 overexpression was observed (lane 7 versus lane 8). These results support the first possibility that NUB1 is an adaptor between S5a and NEDD8 conjugates. In Fig. 3 C, NEDD8 conjugates, which were less than 220 kDa in size, could be detected in the fraction of the 26 S proteasome. In Fig. 4, A and B, however, GST-S5a only precipitated NEDD8 conjugates with higher molecular weight (>220,000 kDa). NEDD8 conjugates, which were less than 220 kDa in size, might bind to endogenous S5a and could not be precipitated by GST-S5a. To examine the involvement of proteasome in NUB1 function, RH-NUB1 was coexpressed with HA-NEDD8 in COS cells in the presence of various proteasome inhibitors, includingN-acetyl-l-leucinal-l-leucinal-l-norleucinal (LLnL), MG132, and lactacystin (22Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). As a control, RH-USP21, an isopeptidase that cleaves NEDD8 conjugation, was coexpressed with HA-NEDD8. As shown in the upper panel of Fig.5 A, the overexpression of NUB1 led to a dramatic reduction of NEDD8 monomer and NEDD8-conjugated proteins (lane 2 versus lane 3). Surprisingly, all of the proteasome inhibitors prevented the reduction caused by NUB1 overexpression (lanes 4–6). In contrast, the proteasome inhibitors did not block the reduction caused by USP21 expression (Fig.5 B, upper panel). Finally, the effect of proteasome inhibitors was tested using NEDD8-G, a C-terminal deletion mutant of NEDD8 (see Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig.5 C, overexpression of NUB1 led to severe reduction of the expression of NEDD8-G monomer (lane 2 versus lane 3). This reduction was prevented by all of the proteasome inhibitors (lanes 4–6). Thus, we confirmed that NUB1 reduces the protein expression of unconjugated NEDD8 through a proteasome pathway. Taken together, our findings indicate that NUB1 interacts with S5a in 19 S proteasome activator to recruit both unconjugated and conjugated NEDD8 for proteasomal degradation. Through conjugation to cullins, NEDD8 appears to regulate many biological events. For example, NEDD8 conjugation to Cul-1 plays critical roles in cell cycle transition by promoting ubiquitination of p21 (CIP1/WAF1), cyclin D, and p27 (Kip1) (11Podust V.N. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.V. Lou R.S. Wang C. Coggins M.B. Pierce J.W. Lightcap E.S. Chau V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4579-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 23Yu Z.K. Gervais J.L. Zhang H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11324-11329Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it controls the NF-κB signaling pathway by promoting ubiquitination of IκBα (10Read M.A. Brownell J.E. Gladysheva T.B. Hottelet M. Parent L.A. Coggins M.B. Pierce J.W. Podust V.N. Luo R.S. Chau V. Palombella V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2326-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Thus, various biological events seem to be regulated by NEDD8 conjugation to cullins and also other target proteins. Recently, we reported two down-regulators of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway. One is USP21, a novel isopeptidase with dual specificity for ubiquitin- and NEDD8-conjugated proteins (15Gong L. Kamitani T. Millas S. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14212-14216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The other is an artificial mutant of UBC12 that sequesters NEDD8 and inhibits NEDD8 conjugation (24Wada H. Yeh E.T.H. Kamitani T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17008-17015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Most recently, COP9/signalosome has been shown to promote the cleavage of NEDD8 conjugation (25Lyapina S. Cope G. Shevchenko A. Serino G. Tsuge T. Zhou C. Wolf D.A. Wei N. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1382-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In the studies described here, we demonstrated the down-regulation of NEDD8 expression by NUB1. Interestingly, the mechanism of action was totally different from that of other down-regulators, such as USP21, UBC12 mutant, and COP9/signalosome. Our results, thus, provide a direct link between the NEDD8 conjugation system and the proteasomal degradation pathway. We thank Hung Phi Nguyen for technical and editorial assistance."

https://openalex.org/W2020811161,"Abstract Ubiquinone (UQ) is a lipid found in most biological membranes and is a co-factor in many redox processes including the mitochondrial respiratory chain. UQ has been implicated in protection from oxidative stress and in the aging process. Consequently, it is used as a dietary supplement and to treat mitochondrial diseases. Mutants of the clk-1 gene of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are fertile and have an increased life span, although they do not produce UQ but instead accumulate a biosynthetic intermediate, demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ). DMQ appears capable to partially replace UQ for respiration in vivo and in vitro. We have produced a vertebrate model of cells and tissues devoid of UQ by generating a knockout mutation of the murine orthologue of clk-1(mclk1). We find that mclk1−/− embryonic stem cells and embryos accumulate DMQ instead of UQ. As in the nematode mutant, the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain of −/− embryonic stem cells is only mildly affected (65% of wild-type oxygen consumption). However, mclk1−/− embryos arrest development at midgestation, although earlier developmental stages appear normal. These findings indicate that UQ is necessary for vertebrate embryonic development but suggest that mitochondrial respiration is not the function for which UQ is essential when DMQ is present."

Cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β, are produced in response to infection or LPS administration. Production of these cytokines has been shown to be important for the cascade leading to endotoxin shock (2Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L.

Other classes of cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 play key roles in decreasing susceptibility to endotoxin shock, principally by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (5Berg D.J.

Heparan sulfate chains of syndecans bind to growth/differentiation factors, anticoagulant factors, and cell adhesion molecules, and have been suggested to participate in various biological phenomena (9Bernfield M.

Here, we described an unexpected finding that syndecan-4 is involved in a mechanism avoiding endotoxin shock.DISCUSSIONTo evaluate the roles of syndecan-4 in the events after LPS injection, Synd4(−/−) and Synd4(+/+) mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS. Syndecan-4 deficiency resulted in increased mortality after LPS injection. This finding suggests that syndecan-4 promotes survival of LPS-injected mice. Systolic blood pressure and left ventricular fractional shortening were lower inSynd4(−/−) mice than in Synd4(+/+) controls 9 h after LPS administration, although histological examinations revealed no apparent difference between Synd4(+/+) andSynd4(−/−) mice 3 or 9 h after LPS injection. These observations indicate that syndecan-4 deficiency could increase susceptibility to endotoxin shock.LPS elicits the production of host mediators, causing hyperthermia, shock, and intravascular coagulation (21Karima R. Matsumoto S. Higashi H. Matsushima K. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 123-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 22Marsh C.B. Wewers M.D. Clin. Chest Med. 1996; 17: 183-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Among these mediators, TNF-α and IL-1β are critical in the pathogenesis of endotoxin shock and organ failure, and they act synergistically in local or systemic inflammation (23Dinarello C.A. Chest. 1997; 112: 321S-329SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that mice deficient in IL-1β-converting enzyme (2Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L. Salfeld J. Cell. 1995; 80: 401-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) or caspase-11 (3Wang S.

Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), which are required for the processing of IL-1β, and mice injected intravenously with anti-IL-1 neutralizing antibodies or antagonists of IL-1β (24Dinarello C.A. Gelfand J.A. Wolff S.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1993; 269: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) become resistant to high-dose LPS-induced shock. Analyses of cytokines in plasma revealed that concentration of IL-1β was higher inSynd4(−/−) mice than in Synd4(+/+) mice 9 h after LPS injection, while the level of TNF-α was not different between Synd4(−/−) and Synd4(+/+) mice. These observations suggest that excessive elevation of the IL-1β level could be one of the causes of high susceptibility ofSynd4(−/−) mice to endotoxin shock.We then investigated the mechanism leading to the excessive elevation of IL-1β. As the first step, we investigated whether syndecan-4 expression was altered by LPS administration. Previous studies have shown that syndecan-4 expression in the microvasculature is limited in the fetal vessels of the placental labyrinth and the capillaries between renal tubules (11Ishiguro K. Kadomatsu K. Kojima T. Muramatsu H. Nakamura E. Ito M. Nagasaka T. Kobayashi H. Kusugami K. Saito H. Muramatsu T. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Ishiguro K.

The present study demonstrated that syndecan-4 expression in the microvasculature became evident in the lung, intestine, kidney, and liver 3 and 9 h after LPS injection. Strong expression of syndecan-4 in Mac-1-positive cells was observed at the same time by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry, while Gr-1-positive cells expressed little syndecan-4. Mac-1 is expressed not only in macrophages, including monocytes and Kupffer cells, but also in neutrophils. Gr-1 is expressed in neutrophils, but not in macrophages. Thus, Mac-1-positive cells expressing syndecan-4 strongly were considered to be monocytes and Kupffer cells in the sinusoids of the liver. Zhang et al. (25Zhang Y. Pasparakis M. Kollias G. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14786-14790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have found that TNF-α induces syndecan-4 expression in endothelial cells by both increasing syndecan-4 gene expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner and by extending the half-life of syndecan-4 mRNA. TNF-α concentration in plasma was elevated 1 h after LPS injection, which was prior to syndecan-4 induction. Thus, TNF-α could be one of the molecules involved in induction of syndecan-4 expression after LPS injection.It is noteworthy that syndecan-4 expression was increased after LPS administration in monocytes/Kupffer cells and endothelial cells, which produce proinflammatory cytokines mediating endotoxin shock (26Miossec P. Cavender D. Ziff M. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2486-2491PubMed Google Scholar, 27Krishnaswamy G. Kelley J. Yerra L. Smith J.K. Chi D.S. J.

However, peritoneal macrophages of both genotypes produced IL-1β at the same levels on stimulation with LPS at 1, 100, and 10,000 ng/ml. This finding suggests that syndecan-4 deficiency does not alter the functions of cell-surface receptors involved in production of IL-1β, including LPS receptor, Toll-like receptor-4 (29Kaisho T. Akira S. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 20: 393-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recently identified triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (30Bouchon A. Facchetti F. Weigand M.A. Colonna M. Nature. 2001; 410: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the hypothesis that increased syndecan-4 expression served to down-regulate the synthesis of IL-1β. Indeed, LPS-induced production of IL-1β was inhibited to a lesser extent by TGF-β1 or TGF-β1 and IL-10 in combination inSynd4(−/−) macrophages than in Synd4(+/+) controls. Previous studies have demonstrated that TGF-β1 binds to heparin/heparan sulfate (31Lyon M. Rushton G. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 32McCaffrey T.A. Falcone D.J. Du B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Our experiments showed that syndecan-4 deficiency reduced the amount of 125I-labeled TGF-β1 bound to macrophages and that syndecan-4 in the proteoglycan fraction from livers obtained 3 h after LPS injection bound to TGF-β1 via its heparan sulfate chains. Heparan sulfate is known to modulate the function of growth factors by promoting their accumulation to specific sites and also serving as their co-receptors (10Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 33Tanaka Y. Kimata K. Adams D.H. Eto S. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1998; 110: 118-125PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wight T.N.

Cell. 1991; 64: 867-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between TGF-β1 and syndecan-4 on macrophages, and probably on endothelial cells, may play a role in regulation of cytokine synthesis to avoid endotoxin shock.Syndecan-4 is a member of the syndecan family, which consists of 4 closely related molecules (10Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane also contains the glypican family, which are heparan sulfate proteoglycans linked to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (10Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was remarkable that deficiency of only one heparan sulfate proteoglycan significantly alters susceptibility to endotoxin shock. This finding will be important in investigating genetic factors affecting susceptibility to septic shock in patients. Septic shock is defined as sepsis with hypotension or multiple systemic organ failure and is a common cause of death in patients in the intensive care unit. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 is one of the toxic principles of Gram-negative bacteria (1Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Annu. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 417-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is a classic example of an initiator of septic shock. Shock triggered by LPS administration is often called endotoxin shock. Cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β, are produced in response to infection or LPS administration. Production of these cytokines has been shown to be important for the cascade leading to endotoxin shock (2Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L. Salfeld J. Cell. 1995; 80: 401-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 3Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J.

Med. 1997; 3: 864-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other classes of cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 play key roles in decreasing susceptibility to endotoxin shock, principally by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (5Berg D.J.

Immun. 2000; 68: 2418-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, much remains to be clarified concerning the regulatory mechanisms for avoiding endotoxin shock. Syndecan-4 (also called ryudocan) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (7Kojima T. Shworak N.W. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4870-4877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kojima T. Leone C.W. Marchildon G.A. Marcum J.A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4859-4869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) belonging to the syndecan family, which consists of 4 members (9Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate chains of syndecans bind to growth/differentiation factors, anticoagulant factors, and cell adhesion molecules, and have been suggested to participate in various biological phenomena (9Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 10Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in syndecan genes provide powerful means to analyze the functions of syndecan molecules in vivo (11Ishiguro K.

Becker K.A. Cumberledge S. Bernfield M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and enhancement of microbial virulence (15Park P.W. Pier G.B. Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M. Nature. 2001; 411: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), while syndecan-4 in anticoagulation in fetal vessels of placental labyrinth (11Ishiguro K. Kadomatsu K. Kojima T.

Saito H. Muramatsu T. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here, we described an unexpected finding that syndecan-4 is involved in a mechanism avoiding endotoxin shock. DISCUSSIONTo evaluate the roles of syndecan-4 in the events after LPS injection, Synd4(−/−) and Synd4(+/+) mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS. Syndecan-4 deficiency resulted in increased mortality after LPS injection. This finding suggests that syndecan-4 promotes survival of LPS-injected mice. Systolic blood pressure and left ventricular fractional shortening were lower inSynd4(−/−) mice than in Synd4(+/+) controls 9 h after LPS administration, although histological examinations revealed no apparent difference between Synd4(+/+) andSynd4(−/−) mice 3 or 9 h after LPS injection. These observations indicate that syndecan-4 deficiency could increase susceptibility to endotoxin shock.LPS elicits the production of host mediators, causing hyperthermia, shock, and intravascular coagulation (21Karima R. Matsumoto S. Higashi H. Matsushima K. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 123-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 22Marsh C.B. Wewers M.D. Clin. Chest Med. 1996; 17: 183-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Among these mediators, TNF-α and IL-1β are critical in the pathogenesis of endotoxin shock and organ failure, and they act synergistically in local or systemic inflammation (23Dinarello C.A. Chest. 1997; 112: 321S-329SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that mice deficient in IL-1β-converting enzyme (2Li P. Allen H. Banerjee S. Franklin S. Herzog L. Johnston C. McDowell J. Paskind M. Rodman L. Salfeld J. Cell. 1995; 80: 401-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar) or caspase-11 (3Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), which are required for the processing of IL-1β, and mice injected intravenously with anti-IL-1 neutralizing antibodies or antagonists of IL-1β (24Dinarello C.A. Gelfand J.A. Wolff S.M. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1993; 269: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) become resistant to high-dose LPS-induced shock. Analyses of cytokines in plasma revealed that concentration of IL-1β was higher inSynd4(−/−) mice than in Synd4(+/+) mice 9 h after LPS injection, while the level of TNF-α was not different between Synd4(−/−) and Synd4(+/+) mice. These observations suggest that excessive elevation of the IL-1β level could be one of the causes of high susceptibility ofSynd4(−/−) mice to endotoxin shock.We then investigated the mechanism leading to the excessive elevation of IL-1β. As the first step, we investigated whether syndecan-4 expression was altered by LPS administration. Previous studies have shown that syndecan-4 expression in the microvasculature is limited in the fetal vessels of the placental labyrinth and the capillaries between renal tubules (11Ishiguro K.

https://openalex.org/W2084148944,"This study investigated interactions between SRY, the Y chromosome encoded male sex determining factor, and the androgen receptor (AR). Coexpression of AR and SRY caused marked repression of AR transcriptional activity on a series of androgen-responsive reporter genes. Mammalian one- and two-hybrid experiments demonstrated an AR-SRY interaction mediated by the AR DNA binding domain. Precipitations with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins indicated that AR-SRY interactions were direct and mediated by the AR DNA binding domain and the SRY high mobility group box DNA binding domain. Transient expression of SRY in LNCaP prostate cancer cells repressed expression of an androgen-dependent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reporter gene and stable SRY expression repressed the endogenous PSA gene. SRY protein expression was increased by proteosome inhibitors and by the androgen-liganded AR in transient and stable transfectants. AR transcriptional activity was also repressed by DAX1, and the effects of SRY and DAX1 on the AR were additive. These findings indicate that interactions between the AR, SRY, and DAX1 contribute to normal male development and function and suggest a general role for protein-protein interactions between high mobility group box proteins and steroid hormone receptors in regulating tissue-specific gene expression. This study investigated interactions between SRY, the Y chromosome encoded male sex determining factor, and the androgen receptor (AR). Coexpression of AR and SRY caused marked repression of AR transcriptional activity on a series of androgen-responsive reporter genes. Mammalian one- and two-hybrid experiments demonstrated an AR-SRY interaction mediated by the AR DNA binding domain. Precipitations with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins indicated that AR-SRY interactions were direct and mediated by the AR DNA binding domain and the SRY high mobility group box DNA binding domain. Transient expression of SRY in LNCaP prostate cancer cells repressed expression of an androgen-dependent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reporter gene and stable SRY expression repressed the endogenous PSA gene. SRY protein expression was increased by proteosome inhibitors and by the androgen-liganded AR in transient and stable transfectants. AR transcriptional activity was also repressed by DAX1, and the effects of SRY and DAX1 on the AR were additive. These findings indicate that interactions between the AR, SRY, and DAX1 contribute to normal male development and function and suggest a general role for protein-protein interactions between high mobility group box proteins and steroid hormone receptors in regulating tissue-specific gene expression. androgen receptor androgen responsive element DNA binding domain ligand binding domain high mobility group mullerian-inhibiting substance steroidogenic factor 1 dihydrotestosterone fetal calf serum charcoal-dextran stripped FCS glutathione S-transferase kilobase prostate-specific antigen Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium cytomegalovirus mouse mammary tumor virus The androgen receptor (AR)1 is a steroid hormone receptor member of the larger nuclear receptor superfamily and is required for normal male development, with multiple AR mutations identified in patients with androgen insensitivity (1Quigley C.A.

The AR also plays a critical role in the development and progression of prostate cancer, with most prostate cancers dependent upon androgens for their growth and responding to therapies that decrease androgen levels (3Catalona W.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 996-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The AR binds to specific DNA sequences (androgen-responsive elements (AREs)) as a homodimer through a central DNA binding domain (DBD) composed of two zinc fingers that are highly conserved among steroid hormone receptors. Ligand binding mediated by the conserved steroid hormone receptor C terminus ligand binding domain (LBD) induces conformational changes that result in dissociation from a heat shock protein 90 complex, dimerization, and movement of helix 12, which creates a binding site for Leu-X-X-Leu-Leu (LXXLL) motifs present in the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC-1, -2, and -3) family of transcriptional coactivator proteins (4Onate S.A.

The N-terminal domain is least conserved among steroid hormone receptors, and in the case of the AR, it comprises about half of the protein and contains a strong autonomous transactivation function (15Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. van Vroonhoven C. van der Kwast T.H.

In addition to the SRC proteins, AR function may be further modulated by a growing list of other proteins shown to interact with the N terminus, DBD, or LBD of the AR or other nuclear receptors (23McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates an interaction between the AR and human SRY, the testis-expressed protein encoded by the sex-determining region on the Y chromosome that mediates male sex determination (24Sinclair A.H.

Nature. 1991; 351: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). Human SRY is a 204-amino acid nuclear protein containing a central sequence specific high mobility group (HMG) box DNA binding domain (29Harley V.R. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1500-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 30Poulat F. Girard F. Chevron M.P. Goze C. Rebillard X. Calas B. Lamb N. Berta P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Similar to other HMG box-containing proteins, SRY generates a sharp bend in DNA with distortion of local DNA structure (31Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Significantly, human SRY lacks a C terminus transcriptional activation domain that is present in murine SRY and which is necessary for murine male sex determination (32Dubin R.A. Ostrer H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1182-1192PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bowles J. Cooper L. Berkman J. Koopman P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that human SRY may function through interaction with additional transcriptional coactivator(s). Initial studies suggested that SRY functioned in male sex determination by directly stimulating the expression of mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) (34Haqq C.M. King C.Y. Donahoe P.K. Weiss M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 35Haqq C.M. King C.Y. Ukiyama E. Falsafi S. Haqq T.N. Donahoe P.K. Weiss M.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1494-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), but subsequent studies have indicated that SRY does not directly activate the Mis gene and may instead induce the expression of other transcription factors that regulateMis (36Hacker A. Capel B. Goodfellow P. Lovell-Badge R. Development. 1995; 121: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Shen W.H. Moore C.C. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A.

SRY function in male sex determination can also be antagonized by DAX1, a testis-expressed orphan nuclear receptor shown to function as a transcriptional corepressor (41Swain A. Narvaez V. Burgoyne P. Camerino G. Lovell-Badge R. Nature. 1998; 391: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The major target of DAX1 on the Mis gene appears to be steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), an orphan nuclear receptor that positively regulates theMis gene (37Shen W.H. Moore C.C. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L.

Murine SRY appears to be expressed only briefly in the gonadal ridge at the time of testis determination (27Koopman P. Munsterberg A. Capel B. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Nature. 1990; 348: 450-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 36Hacker A. Capel B. Goodfellow P. Lovell-Badge R. Development. 1995; 121: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas human SRY is expressed in adult as well as fetal Sertoli cells and in adult germ cells (44Salas-Cortes L. Jaubert F. Barbaux S. Nessmann C. Bono M.R. Fellous M. McElreavey K. Rosemblatt M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 135-140PubMed Google Scholar), although its functions in the adult testis are not known. SRY expression has also been reported in human tissues outside of the testis, including prostate and prostate cancer (44Salas-Cortes L. Jaubert F. Barbaux S. Nessmann C. Bono M.R. Fellous M.

Sasaki M. Angan A. Kumar V. Carroll P. Dahiya R. J. Urol. 2000; 163: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings suggest possible roles for human SRY in maintaining as well as in establishing the male phenotype. It was previously shown that human SRY can interact through its unique C terminus with a novel PDZ domain-containing nuclear protein of uncertain function, SIP-1 (49Poulat F. Barbara P.S. Desclozeaux M. Soullier S. Moniot B. Bonneaud N. Boizet B. Berta P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7167-7172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). SRY was also reported to interact with calmodulin through its HMG domain (50Harley V.R. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Hextall P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The interaction between the AR and SRY described in this report was mediated by the respective highly conserved zinc finger and HMG box DBDs and resulted in repression of AR transcriptional activity. An inhibitory interaction was also demonstrated between the AR and DAX1. These results indicate that AR, SRY, and DAX1 interactions may contribute to male sexual development and function. Significantly, previous studies have shown that the ubiquitously expressed HMG-1 and -2 proteins, which contain non-sequence-specific HMG box DBDs, augment DNA binding and transcriptional activity of steroid hormone receptors including the AR (51Onate S.A.

In conjunction with these findings, the present study suggests a more general role for interactions between HMG box proteins and steroid hormone receptors in controlling the expression of tissue-specific and developmentally regulated genes. A human AR expression vector, pSVARo, was from A. Brinkmann (57Brinkmann A.O. Faber P.W. van Rooij H.C. Kuiper G.G. Ris C. Klaassen P. van der Korput J.A. Voorhorst M.M. van Laar J.H. Mulder E. J.

GST-AR fusion protein expression vectors and the MMTVpA3-Luc reporter regulated by the MMTV-LTR (from R. Pestell) were described previously (58Sun Z. Pan J. Balk S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). VP16 activation domain-AR expression vectors were generated in pACT containing the full-length AR (pACT-hAR), the N-terminal (amino acids 1–500, pACT-ARN), the DBD (amino acids 501–660, pACT-ARDBD), and the LBD (amino acids 661–919, pACT-ARLBD) (59Lu M.L.

An expression vector encoding full-length human SRY with a C terminus Myc epitope tag, pcDNA-hSRY, was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the single exon SRY-coding region from human genomic DNA using the primers SRY5′EcoRI (5′-ggagaattcaattttgtcgcactctccttg-3′) and SRY3′-BamHI (5′-ttggatccagctttgtccagtggctgtag-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites in the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−) expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The GST-SRY fusion protein expression vectors were generated in pGEX-2T by inserting polymerase chain reaction amplification products for full-length SRY or the N terminus, HMG domain, or C terminus. Primers for the N-terminal vector, GST-SRY-(1–57), were 5′N-SRY (5′-aacggatcccaatcatatgcttctgct-3′) and 3′N-SRY (5′-gttgaattcactactggacgttgcctttact-3′). Primers for the HMG domain vector, GST-SRY-(58–137), were 5′HMG-SRY (5′-aacggatccgatagagtgaagcgaccc-3′) and 3′HMG-SRY (5′-gttgaattcactacatcttcgccttccgacg-3′). Primers for the C terminus vector, GST-SRY-(138–204), were 5′C-SRY (5′-aacggatccctgccgaagaattgcagt-3′) and 3′C-SRY (5′-gttgaattcctacagctttgtccagtg-3′). The VP16-SRY expression vector was generated by inserting full-length human SRY into the EcoRI site of the VP16 activation domain vector AASVVP16 (61Vasavada H.A. Ganguly S. Germino F.J. Wang Z.X. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gal4-hSRY fusion protein expression vector was from H. Ostrer (32Dubin R.A. Ostrer H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1182-1192PubMed Google Scholar), and the mouse DAX1 expression vector was from Y. Sadovsky (62Crawford P.A. Dorn C. Sadovsky Y. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2949-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). CV1 cells were cultured in 24-well plates in DMEM with 5% FCS (Hyclone, Logan, UT) to ∼80% confluence. Cells were transfected by mixing the indicated amounts of plasmid DNA with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 100 μl of Opti-MEM for 45 min at room temperature. Each transfection mix was then mixed with 0.5 ml of DMEM with 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum (CS-FCS) (Hyclone) and added to the cell culture well. After 24 h the culture medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of DMEM, 10% CS-FCS with or without 10–50 nm dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as indicated. After another 24 h, the cells were rinsed once with PBS and subsequently lysed with 100 μl of passive lysis buffer and measured for luciferase activity using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The fire fly luciferase results were divided by the controlRenilla luciferase to give relative light units, and the results reflect the mean + S.D. from triplicate or quadruplicate samples. LNCaP cells were transfected similarly, except the cells were initially in RPMI 1640 and grown in 5% CO2 instead of 10%, as was used for the CV1 cells. GST-AR and GST-SRY fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (58Sun Z. Pan J. Balk S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled AR and SRY were generated by in vitro transcription/translation (TNT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system, Promega). The pcDNA-AR or pcDNA-SRY vectors (2 μg) in 50 μl of reticulocyte lysate with 20 μCi of [35S]methionine were incubated for 1.5 h at 30 °C. GST fusion proteins on glutathione-agarose beads (5 μg/sample) were mixed with 10 μl of the programmed lysates in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. After binding for 4 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed in the same buffer except with 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer and run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. pcDNA-SRY or pcDNA control vectors were transfected into LNCaP cells in conjunction with a pBABY-puro vector using LipofectAMINE 2000. Stable cell lines were selected with puromycin (3 μg/ml). AR protein was detected by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal Abs directed against an N-terminal or C terminus peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), using 1:2,000 of the primaries and 1:5,000 of a secondary HRP conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Promega). SRY protein was detected with an anti-c-Myc antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1,000 and a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody at 1:2,000. PSA levels were measured using a clinical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Proteosome inhibitors LLNL and MG132 were dissolved in Me2SO. A strong androgen-regulated transcriptional enhancer for the PSA gene that contains a consensus ARE and multiple weak non-consensus AREs has been mapped to a 441-bp fragment 4.3 kb upstream from the PSA transcriptional initiation site (63Schuur E.R.

A search for additional consensus cis-elements in this enhancer revealed multiple potential DNA binding sites for SRY (not shown). In addition to being expressed in the embryonic urogenital sinus, human SRY is expressed in adult tissues including adult testis and prostate as well as prostate cancer cell lines (44Salas-Cortes L.

Therefore, potential interactions between the AR and SRY in the regulation of the PSA gene were initially assessed. Cotransfection experiments with AR and SRY expression vectors and a luciferase reporter gene regulated by the PSA promoter/enhancer (PSA7kb-Luc) were used to assess a possible role for SRY in regulating this gene. The PSA reporter was strongly stimulated by the AR in the presence of DHT, and this activation was markedly repressed by cotransfection with SRY (Fig.1 A). The repression did not appear to be due to nonspecific or toxic effects, as SRY did not affect the basal activity of this reporter gene in the absence of DHT (Fig.1 B), and similar repression was not observed with control CMV- or SV40-regulated Renilla reporter genes (data not shown). To determine whether the repression might be because of decreased AR expression, lysates from transfected cells were immunoblotted for AR. AR protein expression was greater in the presence of DHT, but cotransfection with SRY did not substantially alter the level of AR expression in the presence or absence of DHT (Fig.1 C). To determine whether the SRY repression was dependent upon DNA binding to an SRY cis-element in the 7-kb PSA promoter/enhancer, additional AR-regulated reporter genes were assessed. The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat contains two androgen-responsive elements and was strongly stimulated by the AR in the presence of DHT (Fig. 2 A). Similar to the result with the PSA7kb-Luc reporter, SRY markedly repressed DHT-stimulated transcription from the MMTV long terminal repeat. A third AR-regulated reporter containing a multimerized synthetic androgen-responsive element, ARE4-Luc, was also examined. SRY-mediated repression of ligand-dependent AR transactivation was also observed with this ARE4-Luc reporter (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these findings indicated that SRY repressed AR transactivation and that this repression did not require SRY binding to consensus cis-elements. To determine whether the repression reflected a direct interaction between SRY and AR, mammalian one-hybrid experiments were carried out using full-length SRY fused to the VP16 transactivation domain. It should be noted that murine SRY has a strong C terminus transactivation domain that is not present in human SRY (32Dubin R.A. Ostrer H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1182-1192PubMed Google Scholar). The VP16-SRY fusion protein alone in the absence of AR had no substantial effect on an ARE4-luciferase reporter gene, supporting the conclusion that SRY does not directly bind to this reporter (Fig.3 A). However, in contrast to the result with the native SRY, ligand-dependent AR transcriptional activity was augmented ∼2-fold by the VP16-SRY fusion protein. As a further control, the VP16 transactivation domain alone did not stimulate AR transcriptional activity. These results indicated that there was a direct AR-SRY protein interaction. The converse mammalian two-hybrid experiment was also carried out using SRY fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain and AR fused to VP16 transaction domain. As shown previously, the SRY-Gal4 fusion protein did not show any transcriptional activity when transfected with a Gal4-luciferase reporter (pG5-Luc) (Fig. 3 B and data not shown) (32Dubin R.A. Ostrer H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1182-1192PubMed Google Scholar). However, transcription was stimulated by cotransfection of a VP16-AR fusion protein (pACT-hAR), and this activity was further stimulated by DHT, supporting a direct AR-SRY interaction. To determine whether the interaction was mediated by a discrete region of the AR, Gal4-SRY-mediated transcriptional activation was assessed with cotransfection of VP16 fusions to the AR N-terminal (pACT-N), the central DNA binding domain (pACT-DBD), or the C terminus ligand binding domain (pACT-LBD). Transcription was stimulated only by the pACT-DBD, indicating that the AR-SRY interaction was mediated by the AR DBD (Fig.3 B). This activity was DHT-independent, consistent with the absence of the LBD that sequesters unliganded AR. The greater enhancement by the full-length AR construct, pACT-hAR, may reflect dimerization or the additional intrinsic transcriptional activity of the AR N terminus. GST fusion protein pull-down experiments were next carried out to determine whether there was a direct AR-SRY"

While transactivation pathways of c-Myc either from the N-proximal or the C-proximal region that is linked to the chromatin remodeling complex have been identified, a transrepression pathway had been identified only from the C-proximal region via Max and Mad that recruit the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex. We have reported that a novel c-Myc-binding protein, MM-1, repressed the E-box-dependent transcription activity of c-Myc (Mori, K., Maeda, Y., Kitaura, H., Taira, T., Iguchi-Ariga, S. M. M., and Ariga, H. (1998)J. Biol. Chem. 273, 29794–29800). To clarify the molecular mechanisms of MM-1 toward c-Myc, cDNAs encoding MM-1-binding proteins were screened by the two-hybrid method with MM-1 as a bait using a human HeLa cDNA library, and a cDNA encoding TIF1β/KAP1, a transcriptional corepressor, was obtained. MM-1 was found to bind to the central portion of TIF1β in vitroand in vivo, and these proteins were found to be colocalized in the nucleus. MM-1 and TIF1β complex in human HeLa cells was found to also contain c-Myc, mSin3, and HDAC1. Introduction of the C-terminal half of TIF1β as a dominant negative form abrogated the inhibitory activity of MM-1 toward c-Myc and greatly stimulated the transcription activity of c-Myc. Moreover, the inhibitory activity of MM-1 toward c-Myc was canceled by trichostatin A, an inhibitor of HDAC1. These results indicate that MM-1 is a connecting factor that forms a novel transcription repression pathway of c-Myc.

Although many candidate genes for c-Myc/Max have been reported, the physiological target genes for c-Myc-Max remain poorly understood. The results of experiments using c-myc-negative (null) Rat-1 cells showed that of the candidate genes for c-Myc-Max, expressions of only a few of the genes were changed in c-Myc-null cells (6Obaya A.J.

It is generally thought that a chromatin remodeling complex binds to a coactivator or corepressor to bridge between sequence-specific transcription factors and basal transcription factors (for a recent review, see Ref. 10Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In the case of c-Myc, Max binds to Mad and antagonizes the activation function of c-Myc (11Ayer D.E Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1993; 72: 211-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), and Mad further binds to mSin3, a corepressor, to be recruited to the basal corepressor complex possessing histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 activity (12Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which c-Myc transactivates the genes in cells is not well understood, SNF5/INI1, a component of SNF2/SWI1 of a chromatin remodeling complex, was recently reported to bind to the C-proximal region of c-Myc to recruit it to the basal transcription factors (13Cheng S.-W.G. Davis K.P. Yung E. Beltran R.J., Yu, J. Kalpana G.V. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). We have reported that ORC1, a component of an origin recognition complex (ORC) of DNA replication, competitively binds to the C-terminal region of c-Myc with SFN5, thereby abrogating the transactivation activity of c-Myc (14Takayama M. Taira T. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 418-490Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TRRAP, a protein related to the ATM/PI3-kinase family, binds to the N-terminal transactivation region of c-Myc and recruits an hGCN5 that possesses histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (15McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A. Dugan K.A. Copeland T.D. Cole M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 16McMahon S.B. Wood M.A. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 556-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TIP49 and TIP48, which possess ATPase/helicase activity, bind to the transactivation region of c-Myc (17Wood M.A. McMahon S.B. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). All of these proteins are thought to remodel the chromatin to activate or repress the gene expression linked to c-Myc. In addition to a transactivation domain located in the Myc box II in the N-proximal region of c-Myc, a transrepression domain overlapped with the transactivation domain has been identified in this region and several genes repressed by c-Myc have been reported (18Li L.H. Nerlov C. Prendergast G. MacGregor D. Ziff E.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4070-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We identified a novel protein, MM-1, which binds to this repression domain and represses E-box-dependent transcription activity of c-Myc (19Mori K. Maeda Y. Kitaura H. Taira T. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29794-29800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which MM-1 represses c-Myc activity, however, has not been elucidated. In this study, we found that MM-1 directly binds to TIF1β, a transcriptional corepressor, and recruits a HDAC complex to c-Myc. Furthermore, a dominant negative form of TIF1β relieves the c-Myc transcription activity repressed by MM-1. This indicates the existence of a novel transrepression pathway from the N-proximal region of c-Myc. Human HeLa, 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Wild-type and various deletion mutants of TIF1β, including 1–371, 1–403, 381–835, 145–661, and (Δ304–380) (Fig. 1 A), were provided from O. Georgiev and W. Schaffner. pGLex-MM-1-(83–167): MM-1 cDNA spanning amino acid numbers 83–167 was inserted in-frame into theEcoRI-XhoI site of pGlex, a modified version of the LexA-derived bait vector for yeast two-hybrid screening (20Ono T.

An anti-TIF1β antibody against the amino acid numbers 383–564 of TIF1β was provided from S. C. Lee. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against mSin3 and HDAC1, AK-11 and H-51, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 cells were transformed first with pGLex-MM-1-(83–167), which did not activatelacZ transcription by itself. The transformant cells were subsequently transformed with K562 MATCHMAKER cDNA (CLONTECH). Of ∼3.65 × 106colonies screened for lacZ expression, the plasmid DNAs in the lacZ-positive cells were extracted by the procedure described in the protocols from CLONTECH. The nucleotide sequence of plasmid derived from a positive colony was determined, and its encoding protein was characterized. GST-MM-1 and GST were purified from a 1,000-ml culture of Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) transformed with pGEX-MM-1 and pGEX-6P-1, respectively, as described previously (21Negishi Y. Nishita Y. Saëgusa Y. Kakizaki I. Galli I. Kihara F. Tamai K. Miyajima N. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1133-1143PubMed Google Scholar). Four μg of the purified GST-MM-1 or GST was first applied to GST-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3, and 1 mm EDTA. The35S-labeled TIF1β synthesized in vitro using pcDNA3-F-TIF1β as a template in the coupled transcription-translation system (Promega) was then applied to the column. After extensive washing of the column with the buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, the proteins bound to the resin were recovered, separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, and visualized by fluorography. Ten μg of pcDNA3-F-MM-1 together with 10 μg of pEF-TIF1β-HA was transfected to human 293T cells 60% confluent in a 10-cm dish by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (22Graham F.J. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the whole cell extract was prepared by the procedure described previously (23Taira T. Sawai M. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Ariga H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24270-24279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Approximately 500 μg of the 293T cell proteins were first immunoprecipitated with a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) or with nonspecific mouse IgG under the same conditions as those of the invitro binding assay described above. After washing with the same buffer except for 0.05% Nonidet P-40 instead of 0.25%, the precipitates were separated in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS, blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter, and reacted with a mouse anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or with the mouse anti-FLAG antibody. The same filters were reprobed with an anti-HDAC1, -mSin3A, or -c-Myc (9E10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The human HeLa cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3-T7-MM-1 and pEGFP-c-myc by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (22Graham F.J. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, the cells were fixed with a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 and reacted with a mouse anti-T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen) or anti-TIF1β polyclonal antibody. The cells were then reacted with Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and observed under a confocal laser fluorescent microscopy. HeLa cells subconfluent in a 6-cm dish were transfected with various amounts of effector plasmids expressing the wild-type or mutants of TIF1β, c-Myc, and MM-1 in addition to 1 μg of pCMV-β-gal and 1 μg of p4xE-SVP-Luc by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell extracts were prepared by adding a solution containing 25 mm Tris phosphate (pH 7.8), 2 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (Promega). After standardization of the transfection efficiencies by β-galactosidase assays, the luciferase activity was examined in the luciferase assay mixture supplied by Promega. To screen cDNAs encoding MM-1-associating proteins, MM-1 spanning amino acid numbers 83–167 was fused to the LexA-DNA-binding domain and introduced intoS. cerevisiae L40 cells. Reason for using this truncated MM-1 as a bait is that yeast harboring full size MM-1 fused to the LexA-DNA-binding domain turned blue without prey vectors. A human K562 cDNA library cloned in pACT2 was then introduced into the transformant yeast cells, and the colonies resistant to aHis marker followed by β-galactosidase expression were selected. Among a total of 3.65 × 106 transformant cells, 325 colonies were His- and β-galactosidase-positive, and 5 of the 68 positive colonies were identified as TIF1β/KAP1 after determination of their nucleotide sequences. TIF1β/KAP1 has been reported to be a transcription corepressor (24Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J.

A. 1996; 93: 15299-15304Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Since the longest clone contained amino acids 381–835 of TIF1β (see Fig.1 A), the full-size and some deletion mutants of TIF1β cDNA were kindly provided by W. Schaffner. TIF1β comprised several domains, a ring finger, B1 and B2, coiled-coil, HP1-binding, plant homeo box (PH), and bromo domains that are thought to be necessary to bind to other protein factors (Fig.1 A). To determine the MM-1-binding region of TIF1β, various deletion constructs fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GALAD) were used for a two-hybrid assay with MM-1-(68–167) as a bait (Fig.1 A). Neither the N-terminal half fragment spanning amino acids 1–403 nor the C-terminal fragment spanning amino acids 694–835 of TIF1β bound to MM-1. All other fragments, including the original clones isolated (394–835, 447–835, 463–835, and 468–835) and fragments spanning amino acid numbers 381–835 and 470–627, bound to MM-1 more strongly than the full-size TIF1β did. These results indicate that MM-1 binds to the central region of TIF1β spanning amino acids 470–627 that includes the HP1-binding domain. The binding activity of c-Myc to TIF1β was then examined using the two-hybrid method. c-Myc fused to the LexA-DNA-binding domain was not able to bind to TIF1β fused to GALAD (Fig. 1 B). To examine the interaction between MM-1 and TIF1β, GST-MM-1 or GST was expressed in E. coli and applied to a glutachione-Sepharose column. The 35S-labeled TIF1β synthesized in vitro in the coupled transcription-translation system was then applied to the column, and the labeled protein bound to the GST-MM-1 or GST on the column was separated in a gel and visualized (Fig.1 C). The results showed that the labeled35S-TIF1β bound to GST-MM-1 but not to GST, suggesting direct binding between MM-1 and TIF1β. To observe the complex formation of TIF1β with MM-1 in vivo, expression vectors for FLAG-tagged MM-1 and HA-tagged TIF1β together were transfected to human 293T cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cell extract was prepared and the proteins in the extract were first immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody or nonspecific IgG. The precipitates were immunoblotted against the anti-HA antibody (Fig.2 A). The anti-FLAG antibody precipitated FLAG-MM-1 (data not shown). TIF1β-HA, on the other hand, was detected in the immunoprecipitate with the anti-HA antibody but not with IgG (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 2, respectively), indicating that TIF1β was associated with MM-1 in ectopic expressed 293T cells. Since TIF1β is a corepressor and has been reported to be associated with the HDAC complex in cells, the same blot as that shown in Fig. 2 A was reprobed with anti-HDAC1, -mSin3A, and -c-Myc antibodies (Fig. 2 B). Endogenous HDAC1, mSin3A, and c-Myc were detected in the immunoprecipitates with the anti-FLAG antibody but not with IgG, indicating that c-Myc and MM-1 are complexed with a corepressor complex including TIF1β, HDAC1 and mSin3A. To determine the cellular localization of TIF1β, MM-1, and c-Myc, expression vectors for T7-tagged MM-1 and EGFP-tagged c-Myc were transfected into human HeLa cells. Two days after transfection, the cells were stained with anti-T7 and anti-TIF1β antibodies (28Chang C.J. Chen Y.L. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5880-5887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the proteins were detected by Cy5- and rhodamine-conjugated second antibodies, respectively, and then visualized under a confocal laser microscopy. EGFP-c-Myc was detected by its EGFP fluorescence (Fig.3 A). EGFP-c-Myc (green), T7-MM-1 (blue), and endogenous TIF1β (red) were colocalized in nuclei as shown by the change in color to white blue-yellow color (Fig.3 A, merge). Cell nuclei were identified by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (data not shown). To observe the effect of MM-1 on the localization of the proteins in the HDAC complex, the expression vector for T7-tagged MM-1 was transfected into human HeLa cells. Two days after transfection, the cells were stained with anti-T7, anti-TIF1β, anti-mSin3A, and anti-HDAC1 antibodies, and the proteins were detected by Cy5- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibodies and then visualized under a confocal laser microscopy (Fig. 3 B). As shown in Fig.3 A, T7-MM-1 and endogenous TIF1β were colocalized in the nucleus with dot-like spots (Fig. 3 B, a–c). T7-MM-1 and endogenous mSin3A were also colocalized in the nucleus (Fig. 3 B, d–f). Endogenous HDAC1, on the other hand, was diffusely located in the nucleus, and the intensity of HDAC1 in cells transfected with T7-MM-1 appeared to increase (Fig.3 B, g–i, expanded figures of nuclei indicated byarrows in h were shown in j andk). These results suggest that MM-1 is in a corepressor complex in which HDAC1 is localized. TIF1β has been identified as a protein that interacts via its N-terminal region with multimeric KRAB domains of the repressors (25Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W.

It has also been reported that TIF1β works as a corepressor in a GAL4 system, and the N-terminal region of TIF1β is essential to this corepressor activity (24Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E.

We therefore investigated the effect of TIF1β on E-box-dependent transcription activity of c-Myc (Fig.4). To this end, we constructed the truncated form of TIF1β that lacks repressor activity, TIF1βΔN, possessing the region spanning amino acid numbers 470–835 (24Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E.

First, effector plasmids for MM-1, full-sized TIF1β, or TIF1βΔN were transfected into HeLa cells together with the reporter plasmid, 4× E-box-Sp40 promoter linked to luciferase gene (p4xE SVp-luc). None of the effector plasmids or the vector alone stimulated luciferase activity, and no stimulation of luciferase activity on E-box reporter was observed by the introduction of MM-1 (Fig. 4,A and B, respectively), suggesting that MM-1 and TIF1β do not react with the E-box sequence. Then HeLa cells were transfected with an expression vector for c-Myc along with an expression vector for MM-1, TIF1β, or TIF1βΔN. As reported previously (1Henriksson M. Lüscher B. Adv.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3797-3802Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), c-Myc stimulated the luciferase activity about 4-fold compared with that E-box reporter plasmid alone, and MM-1 inhibited its activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 C). TIF1β and TIF1βΔN, however, did not affect luciferase activity of c-Myc (Fig. 4 C). Finally, HeLa cells were cotransfected with c-Myc and MM-1 with the dose necessary for repression of c-Myc activity to 50% of that without MM-1, together with various doses of TIF1β or TIF1βΔN, and a dramatic change in transcription activity of c-Myc was observed. While wild-type TIF1β and the vector alone had no effect, TIF1βΔN possessing an MM-1-binding region stimulated the transcription activity of c-Myc by almost 10-fold of that of the E-box reporter alone (Fig.4 D). Since transcription activity of c-Myc is known to be relatively weak, at most 2–4-fold of that without c-Myc, this is the first demonstration of c-Myc having a potentially strong E-box-dependent transcription activity under the conditions used in this experiment. These results suggest that transcription activity of c-Myc is usually suppressed by an MM-1-conjugated transrepression pathway recruiting the HDAC complex, and that once this pathway is abrogated, a strong transcription activity of c-Myc is demonstrated. To confirm the existence of the HDAC complex in this pathway, trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of HDAC1, was added to the cells transfected with c-Myc and MM-1, and the luciferase activity was measured (Fig. 5). The results showed that TSA abrogated the MM-1-repressed transcription activity of c-Myc in a dose-dependent manner and further increased the transcription activity of c-Myc to the level comparable with that obtained after introduction of TIF1βΔN, suggesting that repression of c-Myc transcription activity by MM-1 is carried out by the HDAC complex.Figure 5Effect of TSA on the repression activity of MM-1 toward c-Myc. HeLa cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-gal, 1 μg of pcDNA3-F-MM-1, and 0.5 μg of pEF-c-myc, together with 2 μg of p4xE-SVP-Luc as a reporter plasmid. Various amounts of TSA were added to the culture 40 h after transfection. After 48 h, cell lysates were prepared, and the luciferase activities in the lysates were measured. Relative luciferase activities to that obtained with p4xE-SVP-Luc without effectors are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate the possibility that MM-1 brings TIF1β to c-Myc that leads to a recruitment of HDAC complex, FLAG-tagged MM-1 and HA-tagged TIF1βΔN together were transfected to human 293T cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cell extract was prepared, and the proteins in the extract were first immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody or nonspecific IgG. The precipitates were immunoblotted against the anti-HA, anti-HDAC1, anti-mSin3A, and anti-c-Myc antibodies as described in the legend to Fig. 2 (Fig.6 A). TIF1βΔN-HA was detected in the immunoprecipitate with the anti-HA antibody but not with IgG (Fig. 6 A, lanes 3 and 2, respectively), indicating that TIF1βΔN was associated with MM-1 in ectopic expressed 293T cells. Endogenous c-Myc were detected in the immunoprecipitates with the anti-FLAG antibody but not with IgG, indicating that c-Myc and MM-1 are still complexed with TIF1βΔN. Endogenous HDAC1 and mSin3A were, however, not detected in the immunoprecipitates with both antibodies. Furthermore, when TSA was added to the cells transfected with c-Myc, MM-1, and TIF1βΔN, the luciferase activity no longer increased over the level in TIF1βΔN-transfected cells without addition of TSA (Fig.6 B). Localization of HDAC before and after introduction of TIF1βΔN was, however, little changed (Fig. 6 C). These results clearly indicate that a dominant negative form of TIF1β, TIF1βΔN, prevents the c-Myc-MM-1 complex from recruiting HDAC complex. c-Myc activates or represses genes that are thought to play roles in cell cycle progression, apoptosis induction, or metabolism, and misregulation of genes by c-Myc leads to cell transformation or tumorigenesis (1Henriksson M. Lüscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ryan K.M. Birnie G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 3Hoffman B.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Of the transcriptional regulations by c-Myc, repression is thought to be more correlated with transformation (5Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2913-3016Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Identification of the putative target genes for c-Myc and of the binding proteins to c-Myc have clarified, but still in part, the mechanisms of c-Myc function. c-Myc comprises two functional domains, one located at the N-terminal region and one located at the C-terminal region, and the transcription activation pathways from both regions have recently been identified, as described in the Introduction. As for the transrepression pathway, only the pathway from the C-terminal region, to which Max-Mad complex recruits the HDAC complex, has been identified (29Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1995; 80: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified for the first time the repression pathway from the N-terminal transrepression domain of c-Myc. MM-1 bridges between c-Myc and TIF1β/KAP1/KRIP-1 that recruits the HDAC complex including HDAC1 and mSin3A. These proteins, including c-Myc and MM-1, were found to be colocalized in the nucleus. These results suggest that an active form of c-Myc changes into an inactive form by translocation to an inactive structure within chromatin. Repression activity of MM-1 toward c-Myc was sensitive to TSA, a specific inhibitor of HDAC, indicating that HDAC is involved in the N-terminal transrepression pathway of c-Myc. Abrogation of this pathway by the introduction of half of TIF1β containing an MM-1-binding region relieved the repressed c-Myc transcription activity and further greatly stimulated its activity. In this case, the half of TIF1β used may play a role as a dominant negative form of TIF1β. MM-1 mRNA was found to be expressed from late G1 to S phases and in the M phase of the cell cycle (data not shown), suggesting that MM-1 suppresses the transcription activity of c-Myc throughout the cell cycle except for early-late G1, during which time c-Myc plays a role as a strong transcription factor. TIF1β has been identified as a protein that interacts via its N-terminal region with multimeric KRAB domains of the repressors (25Moosmann P. Georgiev O. Le Douarin B. Bourquin J.P. Schaffner W.

Furthermore, it has been reported that KRAB/KAP1-mediated gene silencing is sequestering of target gene loci to the inert region, where HP1 proteins and HDAC complex are concentrated (38Matsuda E. Agatam Y Sugai M. Katakaim T. Gondam H. Shimizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14222-14229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since MM-1 was found to bind to a region near the HP1-binding region of TIF1β, it is possible that the HDAC complex, including c-Myc, MM-1, TIF1β, also contains HP1 that binds to TIF1β together with MM-1. Alternatively, it is possible that MM-1 and HP1 competitively bind to TIF1β, thereby leading to an HP1-independent transcriptional repression in the MM-1-c-Myc system. We are now testing these possibilities. We are grateful to O. Georgiev, W. Schaffner, and S. C. Lee for sending us the TIF1β cDNAs and an anti-TIF1β antibody.

There is a wealth of reports on situations where a single gene gives rise to a number of translation products that differ in the targeting information they bear, e.g. a signal sequence or lack of such a signal. This has been shown to be attained by multiple transcription initiation sites (1Natsoulis G. Hilger F. Fink G.R.

On the other hand there are only a limited number of examples in which a single translation product has been shown to be distributed between two subcellular locations (7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S.

Dual targeting of cytochrome P4502B1 by two targeting signals to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria is controlled by phosphorylation of the protein, which activates its mitochondrial targeting signal and functionally inhibits its endoplasmic reticulum targeting signal. The NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase (Mcr1p) is sorted to the outer mitochondrial membrane or the mitochondrial intermembrane space in yeast due to what appears to be an incomplete translocation through the outer membrane. Cytosolic and mitochondrial fumarase isoenzymes are encoded by the same gene (FUM1) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (12Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12275-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that these proteins follow a unique mechanism of subcellular localization and distribution. There is only one translation product of FUM1, which is targeted to mitochondria by an amino-terminal presequence and which is then removed by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP)1 (7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This notion is based on previous work (7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar): (i) the appearance of single precursor or mature fumarase bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and (ii) mutagenesis of potential translation initiation codons. Our working model proposes that a subset of the processed fumarase molecules are fully imported into the matrix, whereas the majority (∼70%) are partially translocated so that their amino termini become accessible to MPP. These latter molecules are released back into the cytosol as soluble active enzyme by retrograde movement through the translocation pore (13Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Another unique feature of fumarase is that in vivo its translocation into the mitochondrial matrix occurs only while it is being translated and in vitro it requires the presence of mitochondria during translation (7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol.

Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12275-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu M. Wong S.-M. Tan H.-M. Ting R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 578-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) detected in S. cerevisiae a number of RNA transcripts of the FUM1 gene. They suggested that these transcripts encode two fumarase products, one harboring a mitochondrial signal peptide and the other lacking this sequence, thereby encoding a cytosolic protein. In rat liver Tuboi and colleagues (15Suzuki T. Yoshida T. Tuboi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) proposed that the transcript of the single fumarase gene can be translated from two in-frame AUGs thereby giving rise to two products, one harboring and one lacking a mitochondrial signal peptide. Importantly both of the above alternative models of distribution predict the existence of two fumarase primary translation products. Since the amino termini of fumarase isoenzymes, according to our model and the alternative models above, are predicted to differ, we have made an effort to characterize the fumarase amino terminus and determine its role in fumarase processing and subcellular distribution. In this report we have determined the MPP cleavage site of fumarase and fumarase mutants in vivo. We conclude that for wild type fumarase this cleavage site determines the single amino terminus for all fumarase molecules in mitochondria and the cytosol, thus providing evidence for our single translation product model. In addition, we found that although a mitochondrial targeting sequence is required for interaction of the protein with mitochondria the specific fumarase targeting signal and the immediate sequence downstream are not crucial for the dual distribution phenomenon. The S. cerevisiae strain used was DMM1-15A (leu2 ura3 ade2 his5) (7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Strains harboring the appropriate plasmids were grown overnight at 30 °C in SD (synthetic depleted) medium containing 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco Laboratories) and 2% glucose or galactose (w/v) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids (50 μg/ml).

Fumarase derivatives with six carboxyl-terminal consecutive histidine residues were constructed by standard polymerase chain reaction using naturally occurring 5′-sites of the fumarase gene in pFT2 and the following primer for the 3′-end of the FUM1 open reading frame: 5′-CACGGGCCCTTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTTTAGGA- CCTAGCATGTG-3′. Induced cultures (in galactose) were harvested and labeled with 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and further incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. When required, 20 μm CCCP was added at the start of labeling. The labeled cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, broken with glass beads for 2 min, and centrifuged to obtain the supernatant fraction. Supernatant and pellet fractions were denatured by boiling in 1% SDS, immunoprecipitated with anti-fumarase rabbit antiserum and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fumarase was assayed by the method of Kanarek and Hill (19Kanarek L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 5: 465-474Google Scholar) at 250 nm with l-malic acid as substrate. Citrate synthase was assayed by following the reduction of acetyl-CoA in the presence of 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) at 412 nm (20Weitzman P.D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 22-24Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was assayed by following the formation of NADH in the presence of glucose 6-phosphate at 340 nm (21Worthington C.C. Worthington Manual. Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ1988Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged fumarase derivatives were expressed in yeast under the GAL10promoter, cell-free extracts were prepared, and the proteins were affinity-purified using Co2+(CLONTECH) or Ni2+ (Qiagen) columns. amino-terminal sequence analysis was performed by automated Edman degradation using standard chemistry on an Applied Biosystems Procise sequencer (Model 492). Fumarase derivatives were cleaved by adding 20 μl of the purified protein sample to 80 μl of BNPS-skatole (1.3 mg/ml of acetic acid), and the solution was incubated at 47 °C for 1 h (23Rahali V. Gueguen J. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Vestling M.M. Kelly M.A. Fenselau C. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 8: 786-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitate was washed three times with acetone and dried. For matrix-assisted laser-desorption time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), peptides were deposited on a metal target as co-crystals with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich). The mass spectrometry analysis was done using MALDI-TOF (2E, Micromass UK) in the positive ion mode. For electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (MS) the peptides were resolved by reverse-phase chromatography on a 1- × 150-mm Vydac C-18 column. The peptides were separated by a linear gradient of 4–65% acetonitrile in 0.025% trifluoroacetate A at 1%/min and a flow rate of 40 μl/min. The liquid from the column was electrosprayed into an ion-trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Mass spectrometry was performed in the positive ion mode using repetitively full MS scan followed by collision-induced dissociation of the most dominant ion selected from the first MS scan. The mass spectrometry data was compared with simulated proteolysis and collision-induced dissociation of the proteins in the “genpept” using the Sequest software (J. Eng and J. Yates, both from University of Washington and Finnigan, San Jose, CA). The fumarase amino terminus contains the mitochondrial targeting signal, and the deletion of the signal peptide results, as expected, in exclusive cytosolic localization (7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12275-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Peleg Y. Rokem J.S. Goldberg I. Pines O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 2777-2783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that a mutant fumarase in which Met-24 was exchanged for valine is distributed between the cytosol and mitochondria even though less fumarase is targeted to mitochondria (7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, Wu et al. (14Wu M. Wong S.-M. Tan H.-M. Ting R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 578-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) have reported that a mutant fumarase in which Met-24 is exchanged for isoleucine is targeted exclusively to mitochondria. In the current study we have constructed a fumarase mutant gene with this Met-24 to isoleucine substitution (Table I). Additional fumarase mutants were constructed in which Met-24 was exchanged for serine, and a double mutant was constructed that has, in addition to the Met-24 to serine substitution, an Asn-25 to phenylalanine substitution (the rationale for this is provided below).Table IActivity of mutant fumarases in yeast cell extractsaa, amino acids.1-a μmol/min/mg of protein. Open table in a new tab aa, amino acids. 1-a μmol/min/mg of protein. Table I summarizes the specific activity of fumarase and its derivatives in extracts of yeast cells. As previously described these proteins were expressed from the galactose-inducible GAL10promoter, which in the case of wild type fumarase controls high expression yet with full processing and a similar distribution in the cell as that obtained with expression from the chromosomal gene (7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Wild type fumarase (Fum1) and fumarase lacking a mitochondrial signal peptide (FumΔSP) exhibit similar high fumarase specific activity. In contrast, for mutants in which the second methionine was substituted for valine (Fum24V) or isoleucine (Fum24I), the specific activity was only about 10–15% of wild type fumarase. The reason for this low activity of Fum24I and Fum24V became apparent when the processing of these derivatives was examined. Cultures of yeast expressing the appropriate proteins were induced in galactose medium and labeled with [35S]methionine in the absence or presence of CCCP (a proton ionophore). Existence of the mitochondrial membrane potential is required for fumarase mitochondrial import, and accordingly this ionophore blocks processing by MPP (26Nelson N. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4365-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the absence and presence of CCCP fumarase appears as a lower and a higher molecular weight band corresponding to mature (m) and unprocessed precursor (p) fumarases, respectively (Fig.1 B, compare WT− and + CCCP). The size of FumΔSP does not change upon treatment with CCCP, and the same is true for Fum24V and Fum24I (Fig.1 B, compare − and + CCCP of ΔSP, 24V, and 24I, respectively). The interpretation of the results is that these proteins are not processed due to the lack of a signal peptide (FumΔSP, lower molecular weight band, bottom arrow) or the lack of a MPP cleavage site (Fum24V and Fum24I, higher molecular weight bands,top arrow). To be able to draw firm conclusions as to the role of the second potential initiation codon in fumarase distribution it was important to eliminate the Met-24 codon without destroying the MPP cleavage site (as occurs in the case of Fum24I and Fum24V). In examining known MPP cleavage sites of mitochondrial proteins, that of rat malate dehydrogenase I (MdhIp) turned out to be the most useful for planning fumarase mutations (27Ogishima T. Niidome T. Shimokata K. Kitada S. Ito A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30322-30326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By substituting fumarase Met-24 and Asn-25 with serine and phenylalanine, respectively, we essentially constructed the MdhI-MPP site within the fumarase precursor sequence (see illustration in Fig. 1 A). This fumarase mutant and a mutant with only the Met-24 to serine substitution exhibited more than 85% of the wild type enzyme activity in cell extracts (Table I). More important was the finding that both mutants were processed efficiently as shown by labeling experiments with and without CCCP (Fig.1 B, compare lanes − and + CCCPof Fum24S25F and Fum24S). Fum24V and Fum24I remain unprocessed and exhibit low specific activities, whereas wild type and mutant enzymes Fum24S25F and Fum24S, which are processed efficiently, exhibit high specific activities (Table I). This indicates that the amino-terminal signal peptide is inhibitory to fumarase activity as has been shown for many other precursor proteins. To examine the distribution of mutant fumarases, induced cells expressing these proteins were subjected to subcellular fractionation. The distribution of enzymatic activity is shown in Fig.2 A, and the distribution of fumarase proteins as detected by Western blot analysis is shown in Fig.2 B. As previously reported (7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12275-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) about 70% of the fumarase activity (Fig. 2 A) and protein (Fig. 2 B) is localized in mitochondria, whereas fumarase lacking the signal peptide is found exclusively in the cytosol. For the enzymatic activity, mitochondrial citrate synthase and cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were routinely used to determine cross-contamination of fractions, and mitochondrial Hsp60 served as our control for Western analysis (Fig. 2 B). For fumarase mutants defective for processing (Fum24I and Fum24V), the majority of the activity and protein was detected in the cytosolic fraction even though a reproducible small amount (about 8–10%) is fully imported into mitochondria. Fumarase mutants that are processed even though Met-24 is eliminated (Fum24S25F and Fum24S) are distributed in the cell with about 50–60% in mitochondria. These results indicate that although substitution of Met-24 can cause a significant change in the distribution of fumarase in the cell it does not eliminate the dual targeting phenomenon itself. To characterize fumarase products we constructed genes encoding histidinyl-tagged fumarase derivatives. Fum-6h was essentially identical to the nontagged form in its specific activity, processing by MPP, tetramerization, and distribution in the cell (30Blachinsky E. Processing of the Single Translation Product of the FUM1 Gene (Fumarase) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. M.Sc. thesis. Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2001Google Scholar). Fum-6h and tagged versions of fumarase derivatives, FumΔSP-6h, FumS24F25-6h, FumI24-6h, were purified from yeast cell extracts by affinity chromatography. As shown in Fig. 3 A as with the nontagged versions FumΔSP-6h migrated faster and FumI24-6h migrated slower than Fum-6h on SDS-PAGE. The purified proteins were subjected to sequential Edman degradation, and the results are summarized in Fig.3 B. Mature fumarase whose sequence starts with asparagine is cleaved between amino acids Met-24 and Asn-25. If Met-24 and Asn-25 are exchanged for Ser-24 and Phe-25 the derivative protein is cleaved efficiently by MPP at the corresponding site between Ser-24 and Phe-25. For FumI24-6h and FumΔSP-6h, which are not processed by MPP, the methionine from which translation was initiated is expected to remain at the amino terminus of the protein. These two proteins even at high concentrations were resistant to Edman degradation and did not provide any sequence information. The interpretation of these results is that these proteins have a modified amino-terminal amino acid. The modification of these polypeptides is not surprising, and in fact the fumarase precursor has been predicted to be N-acetylated by the N-acetyltransferase Mak3 on the basis of its amino-terminal sequence (MLRF, Refs. 28Tercero J.C. Dinman J.D. Wickner R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3192-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and 29Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The FumΔSP amino terminus (MNSS) is most probably N-acetylated by theN-acetyltransferase Nat3, which has been shown toN-acetylate among other sequences MNNS and MNFL of CYC-872 and CYC-849, respectively (29Polevoda B. Norbeck J. Takakura H. Blomberg A. Sherman F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6155-6168Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This blocking raises the theoretical possibility that strains expressing Fum-6h may express, in addition to processed Fum-6h, a product whose translation started from Met-24, which would be blocked and undetected by Edman degradation. To rule out this possibility of a blocked fumarase species and to fully identify the products, we subjected Fum-6h products to mass spectrometry analysis. The strategy for identification of fumarase products in the yeast cell was to use MALDI-TOF MS as a tool for examining short peptides from the termini of fumarase. Unmutated Fum and FumΔSP both tagged with six histidines were analyzed. The reagent BNPS-skatole was chosen for this analysis since it cleaves fumarase only twice after the two tryptophans (Trp-46 and Trp-477) in this protein, thereby producing a predicted 16-amino acid carboxyl-terminal peptide and a predicted 22- or 23-amino acid amino-terminal fragment depending on whether the protein was processed by MPP (after Met-24) or whether translation initiated at Met-24 (Fig.4 A). As shown in panels a and c of Fig. 4 B and as predicted for Fum and FumΔSP, a single fragment corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids of these proteins is identical with a molecular mass of 1945 Da (includes a 16-Da addition due to oxidation of the single methionine). In contrast the amino-terminal fragments of Fum and FumΔSP differ showing molecular masses corresponding to 22 amino acids (2584 Da) and 23 amino acids (2775 Da), respectively (panels b and d of Fig. 4 B, respectively). The Fum 22-amino acid fragment includes a 14-Da addition due to formation of an oxolactone by oxidative halogenation on the terminal tryptophan of the cleaved peptide, which is a known modification caused by the BNPS-skatole treatment (23Rahali V. Gueguen J. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Vestling M.M. Kelly M.A. Fenselau C. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 8: 786-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The FumΔSP 23-amino acid fragment includes this same 14-Da modification, a 16-Da addition due to oxidation of the methionine, and a 42-Da addition due to acetylation of the amino-terminal methionine. The difference in mass between Fum and FumΔSP after taking the modifications into consideration corresponds to that of the amino acid methionine (131 Da), while the lower mass from FumΔSP (2714 Da) is most probably the result of different undetermined modifications. To fully characterize the amino-terminal peptide of Fum-6h (2586 Da) this product was identified and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and fragmentation of this peptide was undertaken by collision-induced dissociation. Shown in Fig.5 A are double and triple ions of this peptide, and shown in Fig. 5 B are characteristic internal fragment ions confirming the identity of the peptide. These analyses indicate that the wild type yeast produces fumarase molecules with a single amino-terminal sequence and distributes them within the cell. This amino terminus of Fum is determined by the MPP cleavage of the fumarase precursor between amino acids Met-24 and Asn-25 (Figs.3 B and 4 A). Our working model for fumarase distribution proposes that the fumarase amino terminus of cytosol-destined precursors are only partially translocated and then cleaved by MPP (see the Introduction and Refs. 7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar and 13Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition fumarase translocation into the mitochondrial matrix appears to be cotranslational in vivo and in vitro (7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although Met-24 is not required for fumarase distribution certain substitutions of the 24th amino acid residue appear to have significant effects on distribution; thus, it seemed reasonable that secondary targeting information may be found within the amino terminus of fumarase. The first element we examined was the fumarase mitochondrial targeting sequence. We fused the cytochrome b 2 (Cyb2p) mitochondrial targeting signal to mature fumarase. For this a DNA sequence encoding 39 amino acids (which includes the Cyb2 signal peptide and its MPP cleavage site) was fused to a DNA sequence encoding Fum1 starting from amino acid Asn-25 (Fig. 6 A). This hybrid Cyb2-Fum exhibited more than 90% of the wild type Fum specific activity and was processed efficiently as detected by labeling experiments in the presence and absence of CCCP (Fig. 6 B, compare − and + CCCP). As shown in Fig. 6, subcellular fractionation experiments reveal that about 60% of the Cyb2-Fum enzymatic activity (Fig. 6 C) and protein (Fig.6 D) are fully localized to mitochondria, and the rest are cytosolic, a pattern that is reminiscent of Fum24S25F and Fum24S. These results indicate that although a signal peptide is crucial for mitochondrial targeting, the specific fumarase-targeting signal is not crucial for maintaining the fumarase dual targeting phenomenon. Many secondary targeting signals appear in the protein sequence immediately following the amino-terminal primary signal of mitochondrial proteins. For example, the c 1 andb 2 cytochromes in yeast contain a mitochondrial intermembrane space hydrophobic-sorting sequence immediately following the amino-terminal matrix targeting sequence. The fumarase signal sequence is followed by a highly charged and conserved sequence (R T E T D AFG E I H VPA DK). In fact we had speculated that this sequence may weaken the interaction of the translocating protein with mtHsp70 and thereby delay completion of the import process. We have examined this by specific substitutions and deletions of various portions of this charged sequence. We have constructed three deletions within the fumarase open reading frame which remove 9, 11, and 13 codons from the sequence following the MPP cleavage site (Δ25–37, Δ27–37, and Δ29–37). As shown in Fig.7 A these deletions include the first four charged amino acids following the cleavage site. In another construct, the acidic amino acids Glu-31 and Asp-33 were substituted by glycines. All of these mutant proteins were detected in yeast extracts of induced cells by Western blot analysis but were devoid of fumarase enzymatic activity. FumΔ29–37 (Δ9) is processed efficiently as detected by labeling experiments in the presence and absence of CCCP (Fig. 7 B, compare − and + CCCP of Δ9). The same is true for Fum31G33G (not shown). In contrast, FumΔ25–37 (Δ13) shows a significant defect in processing (Fig. 7 B, compare − and + CCCP of Δ13), which is not very surprising since in this mutant Asn-25 is replaced by isoleucine at the MPP cleavage site. FumΔ27–37 displays a very minor defect in processing, which is not always detected (not shown). As shown in Fig. 7 C, subcellular fractionation experiments reveal that more of the FumΔ29–37 (Δ9) than the wild type molecules are fully imported into mitochondria (60% compared with 30%, respectively). In contrast for FumΔ25–37 (Δ13) only a small portion of the molecules is fully imported (Fig.7 C), which is similar to the situation with other mutant fumarases, which show a defect in processing. Taken together these results strongly suggest that the 11-amino acid sequence immediately following the MPP cleavage site is not crucial for fulfillment of the fumarase dual targeting phenomenon. Our working model is that the FUM1 gene directs the expression of a single translation product. In the present study full identification of fumarase products with respect to their amino-terminal sequences was achieved. Wild type fumarase is cleaved by MPP between Met-24 and Asn-25, whereas a mutant fumarase lacking the Met-1 codon and a signal peptide initiates translation at the Met-24 codon and retains methionine at its amino terminus. Edman degradation followed by mass spectrometry shows that all the fumarase molecules in the yeast cell have an identical amino terminus starting with Asn-25 without traces of the Met-24 variant. Since this fumarase distributes normally between the cytosol and mitochondria in yeast, these results provide evidence for the single translation product hypothesis. A second type of experiment to show the existence of a single fumarase translation product has used mutants in which the Met-24 codon was eliminated by mutagenesis. Stein et al. (7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and Wu et al. (14Wu M. Wong S.-M. Tan H.-M. Ting R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 578-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) have previously substituted Met-24 with valine and isoleucine, respectively. Wu et al. (14Wu M. Wong S.-M. Tan H.-M. Ting R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 578-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) claimed on the basis of enzyme activity alone that a Met-24 to isoleucine mutant is targeted exclusively to mitochondria, yet we find that most of the protein is located in the cytosol. As shown in this study both these mutant fumarases are not processed by MPP in vivo. Thus conclusions based on these mutants should be carefully reexamined. For example we have previously shown that unprocessed fumarase has a tendency to precipitate out of solution and in the case of Fum24I may have come out of solution with mitochondria upon centrifugation. Nevertheless, in this study we have successfully constructed and expressed other Met-24 mutants, Fum24S25F and Fum24S, which are processed in vivo by MPP. These mutant fumarases when expressed in yeast are distributed between the cytosol and mitochondria ruling out alternative distribution mechanisms that require the second Met-24 codon for translation initiation of a second fumarase product (see the Introduction) and support the single translation product model. A third type of experiment supporting a single fumarase translation product was based on blocking processing by MPP. This was achieved either by directly inhibiting the MPP or by blocking fumarase import into mitochondria thereby making the precursor unavailable for cleavage by the protease (7Stein I. Peleg Y. Even-Ram S. Pines O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4770-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our conclusions were based on detection of a single band on SDS-PAGE corresponding to mature fumarase in yeast cells and when fumarase processing is blocked detection of a single band corresponding to the precursor. These results held true for fumarase expressed from the chromosome as well as from a plasmid. The same results are obtained with mutants described in this study and in particular with Fum24S25F and Fum24S, which are processed efficiently and distributed between the cytosol and mitochondria. In this regard, we have previously shown that expression of fumarase from theGAL10 promoter, which initiates transcription upstream to the first potential translation initiation codon, allows distribution of the enzyme in the cell similarly to the chromosomally expressed gene. This finding and the fact that a ΔSP-fumarase like protein cannot be detected in wild type yeast cells indicates that the minority of the shorter mRNA molecules detected by Wu and colleagues (12Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12275-12282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wu M. Wong S.-M. Tan H.-M. Ting R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 578-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) do not appear to direct the translation of fumarase (starting from Met-24). This appears to be true under the conditions of our experiments, yet such RNAs may be expressed in other circumstances. As pointed out above the scenario suggested by Tuboi (15Suzuki T. Yoshida T. Tuboi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) for rat fumarase in which translation can initiate from either of the two 5′ proximal methionine codons does not apply to yeast fumarase (Met-1 and Met-24) since a product starting from Met-24 cannot be detected. Essential information required for fumarase distribution in the cell does not appear to reside within the first 37 amino acids of the precursor since (i) exchange of the fumarase mitochondrial targeting peptide for that of cytochrome b 2 and (ii) deletion of amino acids immediately following the MPP cleavage site (through Glu-37) do not eliminate the fumarase dual targeting phenomenon. Thus, essential information required for fumarase distribution is expected to be found further downstream inside the mature protein sequence. This notion fits our working model that suggests that targeting and distribution involves rapid fumarase folding (outside mitochondria) into a conformation incompatible with further import, which in turn leads to retrograde movement of the processed protein back through the translocation pore. The hypothesis of retrograde movement of the fumarase single translation product is supported by previously published data in vivo and in vitro (13Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The notion that folding outside mitochondria is an important factor in its final subcellular location is supported by the apparent rapid folding of fumarase in vitro (13Knox C. Sass E. Neupert W. Pines O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and other preliminary data. In this regard, experiments currently in progress show that a number of differently located deletions within the core of the fumarase subunit causes nearly full import of fumarase into mitochondria. 2E.

In addition, overexpression of SSA1, a yeast cytosolic Hsp70 homolog, causes the localization of 2-fold more fumarase in mitochondria.2It is interesting to note that the strongest effects of modifications of the amino terminus on fumarase distribution were mutations of the MPP cleavage site. While mutations in which the fumarase precursor is still efficiently processed (Fum24S25F and Fum24S) exhibit only a minor change in distribution, mutants defective in processing (Fum24I, Fum24V, and FumΔ25–37) are primarily targeted to the cytosol. These results can most easily be explained by assuming that noncleavage of the precursor may slow down import providing additional time for more of the polypeptide to fold outside mitochondria into an import-incompetent conformation. Future studies will have to determine whether posttranslational modifications occur in the downstream polypeptide sequence. Such posttranslational modifications and/or molecular chaperones may in fact affect the fumarase conformation and determine its distribution in the cell.

Here we show that p50, in addition to its previously described ability to melt mRNA secondary structure, is capable of promoting rapid annealing of complementary nucleic acid strands. p50 accelerates annealing of RNA and DNA duplexes up to 1500-fold within a wide range of salt concentrations and temperatures. Phosphorylation of p50 selectively inhibits DNA annealing. Moreover, p50 catalyzes strand exchange between double-stranded and single-stranded RNAs yielding a product bearing a more extended double-stranded structure. Strikingly, p50 displays both RNA-melting and -annealing activities in a dose-dependent manner; a relatively low amount of p50 promotes formation of RNA duplexes, whereas an excess of p50 causes unwinding of double-stranded forms. Our results suggest that the alteration of nucleic acid conformation is a basic mechanism of the p50-dependent regulation of gene expression. p50, a member of the Y-box binding transcription factor family, is tightly associated with eukaryotic mRNAs and is responsible for general translational regulation.

Several lines of evidence indicate that p50 is a major general translation regulator through mRNA structural arrangements and packaging (6Spirin A.S. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N.

First, it is found in association with a wide range of mRNAs and displays little or no sequence-specificity. Second, it possesses the strongest affinity for mRNA as compared with other mRNA-binding proteins. Third, it is capable of self-oligomerization, suggesting possible mRNA packaging when p50 is present in mRNPs in high copies. Finally, p50 was demonstrated to efficiently melt mRNA secondary structure (11Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.-L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Here, we report that p50 is able to promote the rapid annealing of complementary RNA and DNA strands and to catalyze the strand exchange between ds- and ssRNAs yielding a product with a more extended ds structure. Interestingly, the DNA annealing activity can be regulated specifically by phosphorylation of p50 by casein kinase II. Based on these results, we propose that members of the Y-box family regulate gene expression at the transcription and translational level because of their ability to modulate RNA and DNA secondary structure.DISCUSSIONIn this paper we demonstrate that p50, a general component of mRNPs in mammalian cells, promotes annealing of the complementary RNA strands and accelerates strand exchange between the partially complementary RNAs, resulting in the formation of more extended duplexes. The effect of p50 is sequence-nonspecific. p50 accelerates RNA annealing up to 1000-fold; this finding suggests that p50 could probably mediate the formation of specific mRNA structures in response to intracellular stimuli. The striking finding that p50 displays both RNA annealing and melting activities in a dose-dependent manner can be of physiological significance. As it was shown earlier, p50 causes opposite effects on mRNA translatability depending on the p50/mRNA ratio (see the Introduction). According to our new findings, this effect could be explained by different conformational states of mRNA within mRNP determined by the amount of p50 bound.p50 is a major and universal component of cytoplasmic mRNPs; therefore, it may play a key role in the mRNA spatial organization and general regulation of translation through structural adjustments of mRNAs. In this connection, it would be of interest to analyze in more detail whether the amount of mRNA-associated p50 correlates with translational regulation during stresses and during the cell cycle. It is currently known that the amount of Y-box proteins increases significantly in cancer cells (35Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar, 36Shibao K. Takano H. Nakayama Y. Okazaki K. Nagata N. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Itoh H. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the amount of their mRNAs increases manyfold during liver regeneration and cell growth stimulation with serum or interleukins (37Sabath D.E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2036-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The stresses (drugs, UV) result in a redistribution of Y-box proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm with an increase of their amount in the nucleus and a decrease in the cytoplasm (40Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 41Ohga T. Uchiumi T. Makino Y. Koike K. Wada M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5997-6000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).p50 shares functional properties with the major proteins of heterogeneous nuclear RNPs (hnRNPs), hnRNP A1, C1, and U, all of which exhibit RNA annealing activity (26Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although there is no apparent sequence homology between these proteins and p50, they possess similar modular organizations comprising related RNA-binding domains with RNP 1/RNP 2 recognition motifs and auxiliary arginine/glycine-rich C-terminal domains (15Sommerville J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 42Graumann P. Marahiel A. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 43Manival X. Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Bouvet P. Erard M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2223-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). hnRNP proteins as well as p50 are able to form large protein particles and arrange RNA on their surfaces (44Samarina O.P. Lukanidin E.M. Molnar J. Georgiev G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). For hnRNP A1 it was shown that the RNA-binding domains display RNA melting activity (45Herrick G. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2133-2141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Karpel R.L Burchard A.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4674-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Most probably, the cold shock domain of p50 is responsible for the RNA melting activity, because the major cold shock protein of E. coli (Csp A), which exhibits 43% identity to p50 cold shock domain, displays the same activity (12Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Also, Y-box proteins were found within hnRNPs (7Sommerville J. Ladomery M. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and their involvement in processing of pre-mRNA was demonstrated (47Chansky H.A. Hu M. Hickstein D.D. Yang L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3586-3590PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, all of these functionally related proteins accompany mRNA at all stages of its biogenesis and seem to contribute to the appropriate packaging of mRNA in the nucleus and the cytoplasm.The ability of p50 to accelerate the renaturation of DNA complementary strands (Fig. 3) is of a considerable interest. Because Y-box proteins exhibit broad specificity in binding to single-stranded DNA sequences (38Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4186-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 48Hasegawa S.L. Doetsch P.W. Hamilton K.K. Martin A.M. Okenquist S.A. Lenz J. Boss J.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we used a plasmid polylinker DNA for our study. Strikingly, p50 shortens the half-time of DNA-renaturation from 120 h to 5 min. Assuming that p50 operates also as a transcription regulator, it is likely that its interaction with different promoter elements induces significant rearrangements of DNA structure, thereby determining the transcription efficiency (50MacDonald G.H. Itoh-Lindstrom Y. Ting J.P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3527-3533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, the DNA annealing activity may be important for DNA repair and/or recombination (51Bryant F.R. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 52Norris D. Kolodner R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7903-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 53Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S.

A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Indeed, increasing evidence indicates that p50 (YB-1) is involved in DNA repair as well as in cell adaptation to therapeutic agents and UV irradiation (35Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar, 40Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4915-4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Of interest is our finding that the DNA annealing activity of p50 can be specifically regulated by casein kinase II phosphorylation (Fig. 6).Although the detailed mechanism of annealing remains to be elucidated, it is obvious that p50 and functionally similar proteins accelerate RNA/DNA folding and formation of more stable duplexes (extended and containing less mismatches). The relatively high p50/RNA ratios required for annealing suggest that p50 works in a stoichiometric rather than a catalytic manner. A similar conclusion has been drawn for other proteins displaying annealing activity (55Rein A. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 297-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 56Hitti E. Neunteufl A. Jantsch M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4382-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It was proposed that these proteins induce melting of the interfering secondary structure, thereby enhancing correct thermodynamically driven intermolecular base-pairing (29Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 57Herschlag D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20871-20874Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In addition, because of protein-protein interactions, the complementary strands of nucleic acids can be brought in close proximity, thereby accelerating the initial rate-limiting step of the annealing reaction (29Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Actually, many proteins displaying annealing activity exhibit a melting activity as well (45Herrick G. Alberts B. J.

In addition, they contain clusters of positively charged amino acid residues in their auxiliary domains, which seem to be important for annealing. The replacement or removal of only a few arginine residues from these clusters caused a drastic decrease in the annealing activities as reported for the splicing factor U2AF65 (60Valcarcel J.

These positively charged clusters are believed to be important for shielding negative charges of sugar-phosphate backbones of nucleic acid strands during annealing. The domains responsible for the annealing and melting activities of p50 are still to be determined. Over the past decade, an increasing number of multifunctional proteins have been described that are involved in regulation of gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (1Wool I.G.

Consistent with these data, low levels of p50 (∼10 molecules/globin mRNA) stimulate translation initiation in vitro, whereas doubling of p50 amounts (∼20 molecules/globin mRNA) results in complete inhibition of protein synthesis (18Minich W.B.

Several lines of evidence indicate that p50 is a major general translation regulator through mRNA structural arrangements and packaging (6Spirin A.S. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N.

First, it is found in association with a wide range of mRNAs and displays little or no sequence-specificity. Second, it possesses the strongest affinity for mRNA as compared with other mRNA-binding proteins. Third, it is capable of self-oligomerization, suggesting possible mRNA packaging when p50 is present in mRNPs in high copies. Finally, p50 was demonstrated to efficiently melt mRNA secondary structure (11Evdokimova V.M. Wei C.-L. Sitikov A.S. Simonenko P.N. Lazarev O.A. Vasilenko K.S. Ustinov V.A. Hershey J.W.B. Ovchinnikov L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3186-3192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Here, we report that p50 is able to promote the rapid annealing of complementary RNA and DNA strands and to catalyze the strand exchange between ds- and ssRNAs yielding a product with a more extended ds structure. Interestingly, the DNA annealing activity can be regulated specifically by phosphorylation of p50 by casein kinase II. Based on these results, we propose that members of the Y-box family regulate gene expression at the transcription and translational level because of their ability to modulate RNA and DNA secondary structure. DISCUSSIONIn this paper we demonstrate that p50, a general component of mRNPs in mammalian cells, promotes annealing of the complementary RNA strands and accelerates strand exchange between the partially complementary RNAs, resulting in the formation of more extended duplexes. The effect of p50 is sequence-nonspecific. p50 accelerates RNA annealing up to 1000-fold; this finding suggests that p50 could probably mediate the formation of specific mRNA structures in response to intracellular stimuli. The striking finding that p50 displays both RNA annealing and melting activities in a dose-dependent manner can be of physiological significance. As it was shown earlier, p50 causes opposite effects on mRNA translatability depending on the p50/mRNA ratio (see the Introduction). According to our new findings, this effect could be explained by different conformational states of mRNA within mRNP determined by the amount of p50 bound.p50 is a major and universal component of cytoplasmic mRNPs; therefore, it may play a key role in the mRNA spatial organization and general regulation of translation through structural adjustments of mRNAs. In this connection, it would be of interest to analyze in more detail whether the amount of mRNA-associated p50 correlates with translational regulation during stresses and during the cell cycle. It is currently known that the amount of Y-box proteins increases significantly in cancer cells (35Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2036-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The stresses (drugs, UV) result in a redistribution of Y-box proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm with an increase of their amount in the nucleus and a decrease in the cytoplasm (40Koike K.

Although there is no apparent sequence homology between these proteins and p50, they possess similar modular organizations comprising related RNA-binding domains with RNP 1/RNP 2 recognition motifs and auxiliary arginine/glycine-rich C-terminal domains (15Sommerville J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 42Graumann P. Marahiel A. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 43Manival X. Ghisolfi-Nieto L. Joseph G. Bouvet P. Erard M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2223-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). hnRNP proteins as well as p50 are able to form large protein particles and arrange RNA on their surfaces (44Samarina O.P. Lukanidin E.M. Molnar J. Georgiev G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 251-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). For hnRNP A1 it was shown that the RNA-binding domains display RNA melting activity (45Herrick G. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2133-2141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Karpel R.L Burchard A.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4674-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Most probably, the cold shock domain of p50 is responsible for the RNA melting activity, because the major cold shock protein of E. coli (Csp A), which exhibits 43% identity to p50 cold shock domain, displays the same activity (12Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Also, Y-box proteins were found within hnRNPs (7Sommerville J. Ladomery M. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and their involvement in processing of pre-mRNA was demonstrated (47Chansky H.A. Hu M. Hickstein D.D. Yang L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3586-3590PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, all of these functionally related proteins accompany mRNA at all stages of its biogenesis and seem to contribute to the appropriate packaging of mRNA in the nucleus and the cytoplasm.The ability of p50 to accelerate the renaturation of DNA complementary strands (Fig. 3) is of a considerable interest. Because Y-box proteins exhibit broad specificity in binding to single-stranded DNA sequences (38Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4186-4196Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 48Hasegawa S.L. Doetsch P.W. Hamilton K.K. Martin A.M. Okenquist S.A. Lenz J. Boss J.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we used a plasmid polylinker DNA for our study. Strikingly, p50 shortens the half-time of DNA-renaturation from 120 h to 5 min. Assuming that p50 operates also as a transcription regulator, it is likely that its interaction with different promoter elements induces significant rearrangements of DNA structure, thereby determining the transcription efficiency (50MacDonald G.H. Itoh-Lindstrom Y. Ting J.P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3527-3533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, the DNA annealing activity may be important for DNA repair and/or recombination (51Bryant F.R. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 52Norris D. Kolodner R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7903-7911Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 53Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S.

Indeed, increasing evidence indicates that p50 (YB-1) is involved in DNA repair as well as in cell adaptation to therapeutic agents and UV irradiation (35Ohga T. Koike K. Ono M. Makino Y. Itagaki Y. Tanimoto M. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4224-4228PubMed Google Scholar, 40Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M.

Of interest is our finding that the DNA annealing activity of p50 can be specifically regulated by casein kinase II phosphorylation (Fig. 6).Although the detailed mechanism of annealing remains to be elucidated, it is obvious that p50 and functionally similar proteins accelerate RNA/DNA folding and formation of more stable duplexes (extended and containing less mismatches). The relatively high p50/RNA ratios required for annealing suggest that p50 works in a stoichiometric rather than a catalytic manner. A similar conclusion has been drawn for other proteins displaying annealing activity (55Rein A. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 297-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 56Hitti E. Neunteufl A. Jantsch M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4382-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It was proposed that these proteins induce melting of the interfering secondary structure, thereby enhancing correct thermodynamically driven intermolecular base-pairing (29Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G.

In addition, because of protein-protein interactions, the complementary strands of nucleic acids can be brought in close proximity, thereby accelerating the initial rate-limiting step of the annealing reaction (29Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Actually, many proteins displaying annealing activity exhibit a melting activity as well (45Herrick G. Alberts B. J.

In addition, they contain clusters of positively charged amino acid residues in their auxiliary domains, which seem to be important for annealing. The replacement or removal of only a few arginine residues from these clusters caused a drastic decrease in the annealing activities as reported for the splicing factor U2AF65 (60Valcarcel J.

These positively charged clusters are believed to be important for shielding negative charges of sugar-phosphate backbones of nucleic acid strands during annealing. The domains responsible for the annealing and melting activities of p50 are still to be determined.

Their primary role is to recruit the replicative helicase onto single-stranded DNA. The “replication restart” primosome, defined in Escherichia coli, is involved in the reactivation of arrested replication forks. Binding of the PriA protein to forked DNA triggers its assembly. PriA is conserved in bacteria, but its primosomal partners are not. InBacillus subtilis, genetic analysis has revealed three primosomal proteins, DnaB, DnaD, and DnaI, that have no obvious homologues in E. coli. Interestingly, they are involved in primosome function both at arrested replication forks and at the chromosomal origin. Our biochemical analysis of the DnaB and DnaD proteins unravels their role in primosome assembly. They are both multimeric and bind individually to DNA. Furthermore, DnaD stimulates DnaB binding activities. DnaD alone and the DnaD/DnaB pair interact specifically with PriA of B. subtilis on several DNA substrates. This suggests that the nucleoprotein assembly is sequential in the PriA, DnaD, DnaB order. The preferred DNA substrate mimics an arrested DNA replication fork with unreplicated lagging strand, structurally identical to a product of recombinational repair of a stalled replication fork.

Extensive genetic and biochemical studies in the Gram-negative bacteriumEscherichia coli have unraveled two mechanisms for activating and reactivating DNA replication. The first occurs at the unique origin (oriC) of the circular chromosome and ensures the accurate timing of replication within the cell cycle (for reviews see Refs. 1Marians K.J. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 749-763Google Scholar and 2Messer W. Weigel C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1579-1601Google Scholar). The triggering factor of this highly regulated initiation process is the DnaA protein, which specifically recognizesoriC. The second reactivation process has been described more recently (3Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 212-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 4Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cox M.M.

Its initiator is the PriA protein, which promotes replication restart by binding to particular DNA structures (8Marians K.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 39-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The replication routes opened by DnaA and PriA in E. colihave been reproduced in vitro with model DNA substrates and purified protein components (for review see Ref. 9Masai H. Arai K.I. Front. Biosci. 1996; 1: 48-58Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In both cases, these specialized proteins promote the recruitment of the replicative DnaB helicase on ssDNA.1 This enzyme can be viewed as the keystone of the replication machinery, because it melts the DNA double helix, is tightly associated with the τ subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and interacts distributively with the DnaG primase that primes DNA synthesis (1Marians K.J. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 749-763Google Scholar). The proteins required for the recruitment of the DnaB-DnaG pair are known as primosomal proteins, and the nucleoprotein complex resulting from their assembly is designated the primosome. The DnaA-dependent primosome forms at oriC and includes DnaA, DnaB, and DnaG. DnaB loading onto ssDNA is assisted by the DnaC primosomal protein (10Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PriA-dependent primosome assembles on two distinct DNA substrates recognized by PriA. The first is a sequence designated pas (forprimosome assembly site), discovered in the genome of the bacteriophage φX174 and required for the conversion of circular ssDNA to dsDNA (8Marians K.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 39-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second is a “D-loop” structure, which mimics the proposed product of recombinational repair of a stalled replication fork (4Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 311-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J. Sandler S.J. Marians K.J.

Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), contains the proteins PriA, PriB, PriC, and DnaT, which assemble sequentially in the order given to recruit the helicase DnaB, also with the help of DnaC, and the primase DnaG. PriA is a helicase moving on ssDNA with the 3′ → 5′ direction (8Marians K.J. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 63: 39-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its DNA melting activity is dispensable for in vitroprimosome assembly on the pas sequence and on an artificial D-loop structure (13Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Zavitz K.H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4337-4346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is essential on a nearly fully double-stranded forked DNA (15Jones J.M. Nakai H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this particular case, it has been proposed that the PriA helicase activity generates the ssDNA substrate required for the installation of the DnaB helicase. Nevertheless, the helicase activity of PriA appears dispensable for its pivotal role in the “coordinated processing of damaged replication forks” (5Cox M.M. Goodman M.F. Kreuzer K.N. Sherratt D.J.

DnaA, PriA, the replicative helicase, and the primase are conserved in bacteria, arguing for generalization of the E. coli DNA replication initiation schemes to these microorganisms. Genetic and biochemical analyses conducted on DnaA and PriA of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis have confirmed their primosomal function (17Moriya S. Imai Y. Hassan A.K. Ogasawara N. Plasmid. 1999; 41: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 2P. Polard, S. Marsin, S. McGovern, M. Velten, D. Wigley, S. D. Ehrlich, and C. Bruand, submitted for publication.2P. Polard, S. Marsin, S. McGovern, M. Velten, D. Wigley, S. D. Ehrlich, and C. Bruand, submitted for publication. However, there is ample evidence for a striking difference in the composition of B. subtilis primosomes relative to their E. colicounterparts. First, no obvious homologues of PriB, PriC, and DnaT are encoded by the B. subtilis genome (19Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. Borriss R. Boursier L. Brans A. Braun M. Brignell S.C. Bron S. Brouillet S. Bruschi C.V. Caldwell B. Capuano V. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar). Second, threeB. subtilis essential genes,dnaB, 3Note that the B. subtilis DnaB protein is distinct from the E. coli DnaB helicase. TheB. subtilis helicase is named DnaC.3Note that the B. subtilis DnaB protein is distinct from the E. coli DnaB helicase. TheB. subtilis helicase is named DnaC. dnaD, and dnaI, are required for the PriA-dependent primosome activity (20Bruand C. Ehrlich S.D. Jannière L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2642-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Two of these,dnaB and dnaD, encode proteins that have no homologues in E. coli. The product of the third, DnaI, has a marginal sequence similarity with the E. coli DnaC (21Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Bruand C. Ehrlich S.D. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1199-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), interacts with the B. subtilis DnaC3 helicase and could be the counterpart of the E. coli helicase loader (23Imai Y. Ogasawara N. Ishigo-oka D. Kadoya R. Daito T. Moriya S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, suppressors of PriA deficiency in E. coli map in the C-terminal moiety of DnaC (24Sandler S.J. Samra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in B. subtilis they map in the C-terminal part of DnaB and not in DnaI (25Bruand C. Farache M. McGovern S. Ehrlich S.D. Polard P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These observations point to the intriguing differences between the E. coli and B. subtilis systems, further underlined by the fact that none of the PriA-dependent primosome components is required for initiation of DNA replication inE. coli, whereas all of the components but PriA are essential for this process in B. subtilis(25Bruand C. Farache M. McGovern S. Ehrlich S.D. Polard P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).2 We report an in vitro study of the assembly of the B. subtilis replication restart primosome. We have purified the DnaB and DnaD proteins and studied their individual and concerted activities in the presence of various DNA substrates related to arrested DNA forks. We present evidence that DnaB and DnaD are multimeric and display affinity for DNA. Furthermore, DnaD stimulates the binding of DnaB to ssDNA and to DNA molecules carrying a 5′ ssDNA tail. In the presence of PriA, which is a better ssDNA and forked DNA-binding protein, DnaD alone and the DnaD/DnaB pair assemble specifically and preferentially on the fork structures with 5′ ssDNA tails. These molecules include the correct ssDNA strand for the proper loading of the replicative helicase. Therefore, we suggest that the assembly of PriA, DnaD, and DnaB promote loading of the replicative helicase DnaC, possibly assisted by DnaI, at the arrested replication forks. Finally, we speculate that DnaD and DnaB play similar roles in the DnaA-dependent primosome that promotes initiation of chromosomal replication. E. colistrain MiT898 (26Polard P. Ton-Hoang B. Haren L. Bétermier M. Walczak R. Chandler M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 68-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was used for all plasmid constructions except that of the PriA Ec expressing plasmid, for which the E. coli strain JC19008 priA2::kanharboring the suppressive mutation dnaC809 (24Sandler S.J. Samra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Strains were grown in Luria broth supplemented with 25 mg·ml−1 of thymine (27Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1992Google Scholar) and ampicillin (100 μg·ml−1). PriA BS and DnaB overexpression was carried out in MiT898, PriA Ec in JC19006 (24Sandler S.J. Samra H.S. Clark A.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 5-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and DnaD inE. coli strain B834(DE3) (28Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4772) Google Scholar). All standard DNA manipulations were carried out as described in Sambrook et al. (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Radiolabeled nucleotide [γ-32P]ATP was from ICN (specific activity of 4500 Ci mmol−1). Oligonucleotides were from Genset (France). All enzymes used for DNA cloning and modification were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or New England Biolabs and used as recommended. Chitin resin was from New England Biolabs. For constructing pSMG24,priA Ec was PCR-amplified from plasmid pAPJ422 with Osmg1-Osmg49 as primers, cleaved byNdeI, and inserted between the NdeI andSapI sites of pCYB1 (New England Biolabs). TheSapI site was filled in with Klenow polymerase prior to ligation. Most of the cloned priA Ec gene was exchanged by that of plasmid pAPJ422 byNdeI/RsrII restriction. The remaining sequence ofpriA Ec carried by pSMG24 originating from the PCR fragment has been verified as follows: Osmg1, 5′ GAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG 3′; Osmg49, 5′ ACCCTCAATCGGATCAACATCCA3 ′. For constructing pSMG6, dnaB was PCR-amplified from chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis strain 168 with Osmg9-Osmg10 as primers, cleaved by the NdeI and SapI, and inserted in pCYB1 cleaved by the two enzymes. dnaB sequence cloned in pSMG6 has been verified as follows: Osmg9, 5′ GAATTCCATATGGCTGACTATTGGAAAGAT 3′; Osmg10, 5′ GAATTCGCTCTTCCGCAATAGGCAGAGTATTTTTTCAGTT 3′. Construction of pSMG22 was in two steps. First, dnaDwas PCR-amplified from chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis strain 168 with Osmg13 and Osmg14 primers, digested with NdeI andSapI, and inserted in pCYB1 cleaved by the two enzymes. This generated plasmid pSMG8. The sequence of dnaD cloned in pSMG8 has been verified. DnaD expression from this plasmid in MiT898 strain gave mainly the expected protein accompanied, however, by two proteins originating from internal initiation of translation withindnaD (not shown). To reduce synthesis of these two products, DnaD translation was placed under the control of the stronger translational signals of the φ10 gene carried by the pTYB1 vector (New England Biolabs). The exchange (usingNdeI-SapI restriction), which gave pSMG22, placed the expression of DnaD under the transcriptional control of the T7 RNA polymerase. As expected, the synthesis of the shorter DnaD derivatives was highly diminished. Osmg13, 5′ GAATTCCATATGAAAAAACAGCAATTTATTG 3′; Osmg14, 5′ GAATTCGCTCTTCCGCATTGTTCAAGCCAATTGTAAAAAG 3′. All protein manipulations were at 4 °C. The purification columns used were all Hitrap from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, as was the desalting PD10 column. The four proteins were purified from fusion proteins with the in vitro excisable Intein-Chitin-Binding-Domain Tag (New England Biolabs). PriA Bs purification will be described elsewhere.2 The same procedure was used for PriA Ec, except that expression was in strain JC19008 carrying plasmid pSMG24. DnaD overexpression was in E. coli strain B834 (DE3), cultivated at 30 °C in 1 liter of LB untilA 600 reached ∼1, and then transferred to 24 °C for 4 h in the presence of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce protein expression. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 12 ml of ice-cold HEN500-T buffer (20 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6), and broken by sonication (Vibracell 72408 sonicator from Bioblock was used). The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × gfor 1 h, and supernatant was loaded onto 2 ml of chitin beads and washed with HEN500; the protein was separated from intein by addition of 30 mm dithiothreitol. After overnight incubation, the eluted proteins were further purified by conventional chromatography. DnaD was diluted three times with buffer Q50 (buffer Q: 50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8, supplemented with 50 mm NaCl) and applied to a Q column equilibrated with the same buffer. The flow-through containing DnaD was bound to a heparin column equilibrated with buffer Q50. DnaD was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient in buffer Q and collected at 250 mm NaCl. To produce DnaB, E. coli strain MiT898 harboring pSMG6 was grown at 30 °C for 15 h without isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. The first steps of DnaB purification were as for DnaD, except that the sonication was carried out in L buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8). DnaB was eluted from chitin beads, precipitated with 45% saturation ammonium sulfate, resuspended in buffer Q50, and desalted on PD10 column equilibrated in the same buffer. DnaB was bound to a Q column and washed with Q buffer supplemented with 120 mmNaCl, and DnaB was eluted in Q buffer with 250 mm NaCl. DnaB-containing fractions were diluted twice with Q50 and loaded on a heparin column. DnaB was eluted in Q buffer supplemented with 400 mm NaCl, desalted on PD10 in Q50, and finally bound on a SP column. DnaB was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient in Q buffer and collected at 400 mm NaCl. A polypeptide of about 110 kDa, co-purified with DnaB, represented less than 2% of the total protein preparation. This unknown protein could not be separated from DnaB either by gel filtration or by sucrose gradient centrifugation at high ionic strength (data not shown), suggesting a stable interaction of DnaB with an unknown E. coli protein. Purified PriA Bs, PriA Ec, DnaB, and DnaD proteins were stored at −20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol. They kept their characteristic “protein-DNA” and “protein-protein” interacting activities for at least 6 months. Protein concentrations were estimated by Bradford analysis using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Electrophoretic analysis of protein samples was carried out by the SDS-PAGE method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Coomassie staining of the gels was performed as described before (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Experiments to determine Stokes radius (Å) and the sedimentation coefficient (s) were carried out in TM buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.1 mmEDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 8). The Stokes radius of the different proteins was determined using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was standardized with proteins of known Stokes radius: thyroglobulin (669 kDa, 85 Å), ferritin (444 kDa, 61 Å), catalase (232 kDa, 52 Å), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 35 Å), and ovalbumin (43 kDa, 30 Å). Sedimentation coefficients were estimated using a 12-ml linear 5–24% sucrose gradient centrifuged for 16 h at 38,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor. Internal standards included for calculating sedimentation coefficients were catalase (11.3 s), aldolase (7.4s), bovine serum albumin (4.2 s), and ovalbumin (3.5 s). Sedimentation coefficients, Stokes radius, and molecular weights were estimated as previously described (31Kolb S.J. Hudmon A. Ginsberg T.R. Waxham M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31555-31564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), using the equation from Siegel and Monty (32Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Nine DNA substrates were used for the gel shift assays as follows: a ssDNA fragment of 90 nucleotides designated Ost4; five forked DNA molecules FI, FII, FIII, FIV, and FV; three dsDNA substrates harboring a ssDNA tail O-5′, O-3′, and O-3′40; a dsDNA of 98-base ds98. The forked and tailed molecules were prepared by annealing of the following purified oligonucleotides: Ost4, 5′ GCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTGACTG 3′; Ost6, 5′ CAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGCCAGCCACAGTCGTGGCCATTGCCATATGGCCCG 3′; Ost7, 5′ GGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTGGC 3′; Ost9, 5′ CAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGCCAGCCACAGTCGTGGCCATTGCCATATGGCCCGGTCTAC 3′; Ost24, 5′ CGGGCCATATGGCAATGGCCACGACTGTGGCTGGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTGGC 3′; Ost25, 5′ CGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACGTCGTGACTG 3′; Ost26, 5′ CAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCG 3′; and Oflo7, 5′ CGGGCCATATGGCAATGGCCACGACTGTGGCTGG 3′. FI results from the annealing of Ost4 and Ost6; FII from Ost4, Ost6, and Oflo7; FIII from Ost4, Ost6, and Ost7; FIV from Ost4, Ost6, Ost7, and Oflo7; and FV from Ost4, Ost6, and Ost24. O-5′ results from the annealing of Ost4 and Ost26; O-3′ from that of Ost6 and Ost25; and O-3′40 from that of Ost9 and Ost25. Prior to annealing, one oligonucleotide was labeled at the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs as recommended by the supplier). Ost4 was labeled prior to construction of FI, FII, FIII, FIV, and O-5′; Ost24 prior to construction of FV; Ost6 prior to construction of O-3′; and Ost9 prior to construction of O-3′40. Unlabeled oligonucleotides were added in a 5-fold excess in the annealing buffer A (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8). The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min and cooled slowly (∼3 h) to room temperature. The annealed products were loaded on an 8% PAGE (30:1) and electrophoresed in 1× TBE buffer. The properly assembled products were eluted in buffer E (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8) overnight at 37 °C and recovered by ethanol precipitation. They were resuspended and stored in buffer A. The correct oligonucleotide assembly was ascertained by radiolabeling of the final substrates and separation on a sequencing gel in denaturing conditions. ds98 was made by PCR amplification of pUC19 plasmid with 1201 and 1211 primers (New England Biolabs) using Taq polymerase (Promega), and the obtained fragment was blunted with Klenow fragment and T4DNAPol (Promega). DNA was loaded on an 8% polyacrylamide (30:1) gel, migrated in 1× TBE buffer, and purified by passive elution (33Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5387) Google Scholar). ds98 was then labeled as Ost4. The concentrations of DNA substrates were estimated by monitoring the specific activity of radiolabeled Ost4 and the final ratio activity of purified substrates. Different proteins were incubated at concentration indicated in the figures with labeled DNA substrates (0.1 nm) in 20 μl of R buffer (50 mm Hepes, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl, 12.5% glycerol, pH 7.4) at 30 °C for 10 min. At the end of incubation, 5 μl of loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.4% cyanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) were added, and the samples were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide (30:1) gel containing 5% glycerol and 0.25× TBE and migrated in 0.25× TBE. After electrophoresis, gels were dried under vacuum, revealed with a Storm Apparatus (Molecular Dynamics), and the results were quantified with the ImageQuant Software and the apparent K D value was determined according to Riggs et al. (34Riggs A.D. Suzuki H. Bourgeoss S. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). PriA Bs (92 kDa) has been previously overproduced in E. coli and purified.2 By using a similar procedure, DnaB (55 kDa), DnaD (28 kDa), and PriA Ec (82 kDa) were purified to a level exceeding 95% (Fig.1; see “Experimental Procedures”). The native molecular weights of PriA Ec, PriA Bs, DnaB, and DnaD have been estimated by the combination of the Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient values, determined by gel filtration chromatography and sucrose gradient centrifugation, respectively. These experiments have shown that the four purified polypeptide preparations were composed of a single homogeneous protein form. PriA Bs and PriA Ec were monomeric, as it was already known for PriA Ec (Table I; see Ref. 35Shlomai J.M. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 799-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, DnaB and DnaD were multimeric, apparently self-associating as a tetramer and between a dimer and a trimer, respectively (Table I). These results are consistent with the recent report about DnaD multimerization state as a dimer (36Ishigo-oka D. Ogasawara N. Moriya S. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2148-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the multimerization of DnaB was predictable from reported double-hybrid interaction (23Imai Y. Ogasawara N. Ishigo-oka D. Kadoya R. Daito T. Moriya S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that seemingly incoherent results were obtained for DnaB, which appeared to be trimer by sedimentation coefficient and close to a heptamer by the Stokes radius. The Siegel and Monty equation (32Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), which includes both the Stokes radius value and the sedimentation coefficient values, indicates that DnaB is a tetramer. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking of DnaB generated a homogeneous form composed of at least four monomers, which had a sedimentation coefficient identical to that of untreated DnaB (data not shown). We conclude that DnaB is a tetramer, of the shape greatly different from globular.Table IPhysical characteristics of PriA Bs, PriA Ec, DnaB, and DnaDProteinStokes radiusSedimentation coefficientEstimated native massNo. of subunitsCalculated mass of a monomerCalculated massÅS 10 −13 skDakDaPriA Bs354.671191.391.3PriA Ec325.881181.881.8DnaB658.0227454.9220DnaD394.3732–327.655.2–82.8The Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient values of each protein were determined from gel filtration and sucrose gradient analyses.

Open table in a new tab The Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient values of each protein were determined from gel filtration and sucrose gradient analyses. Native molecular masses were calculated from the estimated values (see “Experimental Procedures”). To determine whether the three B. subtilis proteins interact with each other, the appropriate mixtures were made with pairs of proteins and analyzed by gel filtration, sucrose gradient sedimentation, and cross-link experiments. No protein-protein interaction was detected, even at low ionic strength (data not shown). We then tested whether the three proteins interact in the presence of different synthetic forked DNA. These substrates supposedly mimic the chromosomal sites targeted by PriA to promote DNA replication restart. Before carrying out the mixing experiments, proteins were individually assayed with various DNA substrates. The substrates used were the 90-nucleotide single-stranded oligonucleotide Ost4 and the five Y-shaped DNA structures presented in Fig. 2. FI, FII, FIII, and FIV mimic particular forks that may be encountered during chromosomal DNA replication. FI represents a half of an open duplex, which could form at oriC by the action of DnaA. FII, FIII, and FIV have a sequence identical to FI but with the leading, the lagging, or both strands replicated, respectively. FII mimics the forked structure on which PriA Ec promotes replication in vitro (13Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25033-25041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A double-stranded DNA of 98 base pairs (ds98) and the FV fork, which is identical to FIV but with no strand interruption, were also used as controls and known to interact poorly with PriA Ec (12McGlynn P. Al-Deib A.A. Liu J. Marians K.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We have observed previously a stable and specific binding of PriA Bs to an artificial D-loop structure.2 Here we observed PriA Bs binding to all substrates with almost the same apparentK D, except to ds98 and to FV (TableII and Fig. 2 C).

More recent reports concern the sequence homology of CCF with LPS and β-1,3-glucan recognition proteins from arthropods (11Lee S.Y. Wang R. Söderhäll K. J. Biol.

Folia Microbiol. 2000; 45: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All these invertebrate homologs have been suggested to play a role in invertebrate innate immunity acting as pattern recognition receptors. Accordingly, CCF binds with cell wall components of Gram-negative bacteria or yeast (the O-antigen of LPS, β-1,3-glucans, N,N′-diacetylchitobiose), triggering the activation of the prophenoloxidase (pro-PO) cascade (3Beschin A. Bilej M. Hanssens P. Raymakers J. Van Dijck E. Revets H. Brys L. Gomez J. De Baetselier P. Timmermans M. J. Biol.

This pathway results in the formation of cytotoxic and antimicrobial compounds and thus represents an important defense mechanism in a variety of invertebrates (for review see Refs.16Smith V.J. Adv.

Cerenius L. Cur. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Pro-PO cascade is activated within 6 h in E. foetidacoelomic fluid by Gram-negative but not Gram-positive bacteria (3Beschin A. Bilej M. Hanssens P. Raymakers J. Van Dijck E. Revets H. Brys L. Gomez J. De Baetselier P. Timmermans M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24948-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, E. foetida coelomic fluid incubated for 6 h with Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria exhibits a similar antibacterial effect (19Valembois P. Roch P. Lassègues M. Brehèlin M. Immunity in Invertebrates. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York1986: 74-93Crossref Google Scholar). Whether the failure of Gram-positive bacteria to induce the pro-PO cascade resulted from insufficient activation time is not clear. The cell wall of virtually all bacteria consists of a rigid peptidoglycan layer that is either overlaid by an outer LPS layer in Gram-negative bacteria or remains exposed on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria. Peptidoglycan is a polymer of alternatingN-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid units connected by short pentapeptides. The β-1,4-glycosidic bond of the N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid peptidoglycan backbone can be hydrolyzed by lysozyme (muramidase; mucopeptide N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase; EC 3.2.1.17), a ubiquitous enzyme involved in innate immune reaction of numerous animal species, including annelids (20Çotuk A. Dales R.P. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1984; 78A: 469-474Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Ito Y. Yoshikawa A. Hotani T. Fukuda S. Sugimura K. Imoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the present work, we examined whether Gram-positive bacteria trigger the pro-PO cascade in the earthworm coelomic fluid. We report that digestion of the Gram-positive bacteria or peptidoglycan by lysozyme-like activity makes it possible to induce the pro-PO cascade through the recognition of muramic acid by CCF. We also show that the broad specificity of CCF results from the presence of two distinct lectin-like domains within the molecule, a domain located in the central part of CCF implicated in interactions with LPS and β-1,3-glucans, and a C-terminal tryptophan-rich domain interacting with N,N′-diacetylchitobiose and muramic acid. Finally we observed that the CCF homolog in the E. foetida-related species Lumbricus terrestris displays distinct saccharide specificities and does not recognizeN,N′-diacetylchitobiose and muramic acid.E. foetida CCF is, to our knowledge, the first invertebrate defense molecule acting as pattern recognition molecule for cell wall components of yeast and Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Cell-free coelomic fluid was collected from adult specimens of E. foetida foetida (common brandling worm) and L. terrestris (common earthworm) in the absence of serine protease inhibitor as described previously (2Bilej M.

Synthetic analogs of peptidoglycan fragments (muramic acid, muramyl dipeptide (MurNAc-l-Ala-d-isoglutamine, MDP), disaccharide dipeptide (GlcNAc-β-1,4-MDP), and peptidoglycan pentapeptide (l-Ala-d-isoglutaminyl-l-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala)), LPS (E. coli 055:B5 S strain), β-1,3-glucans curdlan (insoluble) and laminarin (soluble),N,N′-diacetylchitobiose (soluble and insolubilized on 4% agarose beads), N-acetylglucosamine, hen egg lysozyme, and trypsin were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Bacteria and other reagents were suspended in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl (TN buffer) at 1 mg/ml and sonicated until clarification. Insoluble curdlan was suspended in water (10 mg/ml) and sonicated. Further dilutions were performed in TN buffer. LPS contamination of buffers or samples other than LPS was below the detection limit or <35 pg/mg, respectively, as assessed by QCL LAL test (Bio-Whittaker, Europe). Body pieces of adult E. foetida or L. terrestris earthworms kept for 2 days on filter paper soaked with isotonic phosphate-buffered saline in the presence of penicillin/streptomycin (100 units, 100 μg/ml) were excised and placed in liquid nitrogen, and total RNAs were prepared using TRIzol (Sigma). All molecular biology procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. An E. foetida CCF (ECCF) homolog was detected in L. terrestris by Northern blot using total ECCF cDNA as a probe; a 1.6-kb mRNA was observed. 2M. Bilej, P. De Baetselier, E. Van Dijck, B.

After digestion, PCR products were ligated in QIAexpress PQE-30 vector containing a N-terminal 6× His-affinity tag (Qiagen). The TOP10F′ E. coli strain was transformed, grown in the presence of ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and induced for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (2 mm). CCF peptides were purified and resuspended in TN buffer as described previously (3Beschin A. Bilej M. Hanssens P. Raymakers J. Van Dijck E. Revets H. Brys L. Gomez J. De Baetselier P. Timmermans M.

Briefly, 50 μl of the coelomic fluid (without or with 1 mmPefabloc (serine proteinase inhibitor, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), 25 μl of 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, containing 50 mmCa2+ and 10 μl of l-DOPA (3-(3,4-dihydroxylphenyl)-l-alanine, Fluka, final concentration 1.5 mm) was incubated at room temperature for 6 h in the absence or presence of tested compounds (1 μg/ml). The oxidation of l-DOPA was measured at 492 nm and expressed as the difference between the values without and with Pefabloc. In some experiments, M. lysodeikticus and E. colisuspensions or M. lysodeikticus peptidoglycan were preincubated with hen egg lysozyme or trypsin (1 μg/mg bacteria or 1 μg/mg peptidoglycan, up to 5 h), or with coelomic fluid proteins (1 mg/mg bacteria or 1 mg/mg peptidoglycan, up to 12 h) before testing the activation of the pro-PO cascade. CCF-depleted coelomic fluid was obtained by incubating the coelomic fluid with an anti-CCF immunoaffinity column for 1 h at 4 °C (2Bilej M. Brys L. Beschin A. Lucas R. Vercauteren E. Hanusova R.

After centrifugation, CCF-depleted coelomic fluid was used in l-DOPA oxidation test as described above. To reconstitute the pro-PO-activating cascade, equivalent concentrations of recombinant CCF or CCF peptides (25 pmol/ml) were added to CCF-depleted coelomic fluid before testing l-DOPA oxidation. CCF and CCF peptides in TN buffer (25 nmol in 500 μl) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with curdlan particles (10 mg/ml; 100 μl) or with agarose-insolubilizedN,N′-diacetylchitobiose (50 μl). After washings in phosphate-buffered saline (1 ml, 13 000 × g, 10× for 2 min) the bound material was eluted in 50 μl of 0.0625m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled (6 min) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%). To investigate the specificity of the interaction with curdlan orN,N′-diacetylchitobiose, CCF peptides were preincubated with soluble laminarin orN,N′-diacetylchitobiose (100 μg/100 μl; 30 min at 4 °C) before testing the ability to bind curdlan or agarose-insolubilized N,N′-diacetylchitobiose as described above. Coomassie Blue-stained proteins were quantified densitometrically using Analytical Imaging Station software (Imaging Research Inc., St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada). Data (mean of triplicate ± S.D.) are representative of three independent experiments performed. The validity of the results was assessed by Student's t test. The coelomic fluid of E. foetida earthworms displays phenoloxidase (PO) activity within 6 h upon recognition of yeast or Gram-negative bacteria (3Beschin A. Bilej M. Hanssens P. Raymakers J.

With a similar experimental procedure, Gram-positive bacteria did not trigger the coelomic fluid PO activity. However, the coelomic fluid of E. foetidawas described to display lysozyme-like activity, with 50 μg of coelomic fluid proteins exhibiting an activity comparable with 1 μg of hen egg lysozyme in M. lysodeikticus bacteriolytic assay (20Çotuk A.

Biochem. 1999; 259: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether PO activity could be triggered in E. foetida coelomic fluid by M. lysodeikticuspretreated with coelomic fluid or hen egg lysozyme. As shown in Fig.1 A, whereas intact M. lysodeikticus did not trigger detectable PO activity within 6 h of incubation in coelomic fluid, bacteria pretreated for 12 h did so with considerable efficiency. In addition, bacteria pretreated for 5 h with lysozyme, but not with trypsin (up to 12 h), activated the pro-PO cascade in E. foetida coelomic fluid. Similar results were observed with B. subtilis.2In contrast, Gram-negative E. coli suspension triggered similar levels of pro-PO activity whether or not predigested with lysozyme or coelomic fluid proteins (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, peptidoglycan purified from the M. lysodeikticus cell wall did not induce PO activity unless preincubated with hen egg lysozyme for 5 h or with coelomic fluid for 12 h (Fig.1 B). Because lysozyme hydrolyzes the β-1,4-glycosidic bond between N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid of peptidoglycan, we tested the ability of synthetic peptidoglycan analogs (muramyl dipeptide, disaccharide dipeptide, muramic acid, pentapeptide, and N-acetylglucosamine) to trigger the pro-PO activation in E. foetida coelomic fluid. Muramyl residue-containing analogs and muramic acid efficiently activated the pro-PO cascade, whereas pentapeptide and N-acetylglucosamine did not (Fig. 2). The PO-inducing activity of Gram-positive bacteria, or peptidoglycan digested with lysozyme or coelomic fluid proteins,2 and of muramyl dipeptide, disaccharide dipeptide, and muramic acid (Fig. 2) was abolished in CCF-depleted coelomic fluid and reconstituted by adding recombinant CCF.Figure 2Activation of the pro-PO cascade in E. foetida coelomic fluid by synthetic peptidoglycan analogs. The ability of synthetic peptidoglycan analogs (see text) to trigger E. foetida pro-PO activity was evaluated in coelomic fluid, CCF-depleted coelomic fluid, or in CCF-depleted coelomic fluid reconstituted with E. foetida CCF. PO activity elicited in the absence of peptidoglycan analogs is also indicated. *, p < 0.05 as compared with background values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Together, these data indicate that E. foetida CCF displays a broad pattern recognition specificity for yeast as well as Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The coelomic fluid of another oligochaete species, L. terrestris, contains a 42-kDa protein cross-reacting with monoclonal antibody elicited against E. foetida CCF, indicating the existence of a CCF-like molecule.2 PO activity was induced by LPS and laminarin (β-1,3-glucan) in L. terrestris coelomic fluid (Fig. 3). However, in contrast to E. foetida, neitherN,N′-diacetylchitobiose (GlcNAc-β-1,4-GlcNAc), nor peptidoglycan hydrolyzed with lysozyme or coelomic fluid proteins, nor synthetic peptidoglycan analogs (muramic acid, muramyl dipeptide, disaccharide dipeptide, pentapeptide, orN-acetylglucosamine) activated the PO cascade in L. terrestris coelomic fluid. These results suggest that L. terrestris CCF has a narrower pattern recognition specificity thanE. foetida CCF. L. terrestris CCF-like molecule was cloned, and the amino acid sequence was compared with the sequence ofE. foetida CCF (Fig. 4). The two molecules displayed 91% of homology, with identity in the putative polysaccharide-binding motif of bacterial glucanase (7Lee W.J. Lee J.D. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7888-7893Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 22Yahata N. Watanabe T. Nakamura Y. Yamamoto Y. Kamimiya S. Tanaka H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14530-14535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both E. foetida and L. terrestris CCF molecules contained three conserved cysteine residues and a remarkably high number of tryptophan residues (7%), the majority of which are located in the C-terminal part of the molecule. Peptide constructs covering the two putative functional regions of CCF, as well as the tryptophan-rich domain, were expressed in bacteria to identify the carbohydrate recognition domain(s) (Fig.5). Peptide 1 consisted of the N-terminal part of the molecule, including the polysaccharide-binding and glucanase motifs. Peptide 2 starting from the polysaccharide-binding and glucanase motifs comprised the tryptophan-rich C-terminal part as well. Peptide 3 represented the N-terminal part of CCF but did not include any of the putative functional regions. Peptide 4 corresponded to the 78 amino acids encompassing the polysaccharide-binding and glucanase motifs. Peptide 5 represented the tryptophan-rich C-terminal part of CCF. The entire molecule and all the above-mentioned peptide constructs were derived from E. foetida CCF (ECCF, E1, E2, E3, E4, E5). In L. terrestris, the entire protein and peptides 2 and 4 (LCCF, L2, L4) were used in further experiments. CCF and derived peptides from bothE. foetida and L. terrestris were subjected to curdlan (β-1,3-glucan) orN,N′-diacetylchitobiose binding assay. To exclude nonspecific interactions, protein samples were preincubated either with soluble laminarin or N,N′-diacetylchitobiose prior to the saccharide binding assay. As shown in TableII, all tested proteins, except for peptides E3 and E5, bound specifically to β-1,3-glucans, showing the importance of polysaccharide-binding and/or glucanase motifs for interaction of CCF with β-1,3-glucans. On the other hand, only ECCF, E2, and E5, i.e. peptides comprising the C-terminal region of CCF, recognized N,N′-diacetylchitobiose. None of the L. terrestris CCF constructs interacted withN,N′-diacetylchitobiose.Table IIBinding of CCF peptides to insoluble β-1,3-glucans or insolubilized N,N′-diacetychitobioseBinding to curdlanInhibition with laminarinBinding toN,N′-diacetychitobioseInhibition with N,N′-diacetychitobioseE. foetidaL. terrestrisE. foetidaL. terrestrisE. foetidaL. terrestrisE. foetidaL. terrestris% 2-aMean inhibition of triplicates, representative of three independent experiments; S.D. were <10% of the mean inhibition.% 2-aMean inhibition of triplicates, representative of three independent experiments; S.D. were <10% of the mean inhibition.CCF++8093+−85Peptide 1+ND2-bND, not done.75−NDPeptide 2++9098+−95Peptide 3−ND−NDPeptide 4++9195−−82Peptide 5−ND+NDE. foetida or L. terrestris CCF and CCF peptides, used as such or preincubated with soluble laminarin orN,N′-diacetylchitobiose, were incubated with curdlan (insoluble β-1,3-glucan) or with agarose-insolubilizedN,N′-diacetylchitobiose.

The binding experiments indicated that distinct domains of CCF recognized different saccharide moieties. This assumption was tested in the pro-PO activation test. E. foetida coelomic fluid, but not CCF-depleted coelomic fluid, exhibited PO activity upon activation with LPS, laminarin,N,N′-diacetylchitobiose, and muramic acid (TableIII). In CCF-depleted coelomic fluid, the PO activity was completely reconstituted in the presence of the four triggering agents by adding ECCF or E2. Peptides E1 and E4 containing polysaccharide-binding and glucanase motifs reconstituted the pro-PO cascade only in the presence of LPS and laminarin, whereas E5 covering the C-terminal part of ECCF restored the PO activity triggered byN,N′-diacetylchitobiose and muramic acid. The CCF N-terminal part E3 did not restore the PO activity assessed by any of the triggering agents in CCF-depleted coelomic fluid.Table IIIReconstitution of pro-PO cascade in E. foetida CCF-depleted coelomic fluid by E. foetida CCF peptidesE. foetidaCFDepleted CFDepleted CF + ECCFDepleted CF + E1Depleted CF + E2Depleted CF + E3Depleted CF + E4Depleted CF + E5LPS0.618 ± 0.0860.058 ± 0.0163-aLower than the CF values (p < 0.01).0.426 ± 0.0630.406 ± 0.0480.406 ± 0.0510.044 ± 0.0153-aLower than the CF values (p < 0.01).0.372 ± 0.0730.074 ± 0.0233-aLower than the CF values (p < 0.01).Laminarin0.564 ± 0.0610.048 ± 0.0113-aLower than the CF values (p < 0.01).0.395 ± 0.0710.392 ± 0.0550.448 ± 0.0730.059 ± 0.0193-aLower than the CF values (p < 0.01).0.381 ± 0.0590.085 ± 0.0313-aLower than the CF values (p < 0.01).N,N′-Diacetylchitobiose0.486 ± 0.0540.044 ± 0.0223-aLower than the CF values (p < 0.01).0.420 ± 0.0540.046 ± 0.0173-aLower than the CF values (p < 0.01).0.405 ± 0.0630"

Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) is expressed predominantly in lymphoid tissues and has been studied extensively in the context of viral infection and the induction of interferon and cytokine gene expression. In this paper, the involvement of IRF-7 in monocyte differentiation was examined in U937, HL60, and human primary macrophages. We report the induction of IRF-7 expression by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in U937 and HL60 cells and demonstrate that this induction is essential for the monocyte differentiation to macrophages. We show that the monocyte differentiation is inhibited in cells expressing a dominant negative IRF-7 mutant, as evidenced by decreased expression of two macrophage-differentiation markers, CD11b and CD11c, and impaired phagocytic activity. In addition, we demonstrate that overexpression of IRF-7 is sufficient to trigger monocyte differentiation and to induce cell cycle arrest. The identification of IRF-7 as a key regulator in monocyte differentiation suggests a novel function of IRF-7 in innate immunity.

Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The biological activities of IRFs are manifested through the binding, via their highly homologous N-terminal DNA binding domains, to a specific DNA sequence termed interferon response element (IRF-E; consensus sequence AANNGAAA) located in the promoter region of their target genes. IRFs have been implicated in a variety of cellular events, including cell-growth regulation and host defense against viral infection (2Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 3Lohoff M. Duncan G.S. Ferrick D. Mittrucker H.W. Bischof S. Prechtl S. Rollinghoff M. Schmitt E. Pahl A. Mak T.W. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Studies with knockout mice point out an important role of IRFs in development and function of the immune system. The numbers of CD8+ T cells and NK cells are dramatically decreased in IRF-1−/− mice, indicating an essential role of IRF-1 in their development (2Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Both IRF-4 and IRF-8 are predominantly expressed in lymphoid or myeloid cells. The IRF-4−/− mice showed a profound reduction in serum immunoglobulin level and a lack of responses to both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antigen stimulation (4Mittrucker H.W. Matsuyama T.

In contrast, IRF-8−/− mice showed a marked deficiency in myeloid cell development, featuring a dramatic expansion of granulocytes and a lack of mature macrophages (5Holtschke T. Lohler J. Kanno Y.

IRF-7 was originally cloned from Epstein-Barr virus immortalized B cells as a repressor of the Qp promoter of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 gene (6Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell.

It has since been demonstrated that IRF-7 plays an important role in innate immunity where, together with IRF-3, it controls the expression of interferon α/β (IFN-α/-β), as well as chemokines such as RANTES (regulated onactivation normal T cellexpressed and secreted)in virus-infected cells (7Wathelet M.G.

Both of these factors are components of a transcriptional enhancersome on the promoter region of IFN-β gene (7Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Even though early studies suggested that IRF-7 needs to be modified by a virus-mediated phosphorylation to translocate into nucleus, several recent observations indicate that IRF-7 is also constitutively active in the uninfected cells. First, IRF-7 was found in the nucleus of uninfected cells (8Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29210-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16Marie I. Smith E. Prakash A. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and third, several potential target genes of IRF-7 such as transporter associated with antigen presentation 2 and histone H4 were identified in the absence of active virus infection (18Zhang L. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Xie R. van Wijnen A.J. van Der Meijden C. Luong M.X. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. J. Biol.

Like IRF-4 and IRF-8, IRF-7 is predominantly expressed in cells of lymphoid origin; however, its level of expression could be up-regulated by virus infection, interferon treatment, and LPS (6Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 8Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Although IRF-7 has been studied extensively in the context of induction of interferon genes its possible roles in the development of the immune system have not been addressed. U937 and HL60 cells are promonocytic cell lines that, upon TPA treatment, can differentiate into macrophages; hence they have been used extensively as a model system to examine the factors involved in monocyte differentiation. In this paper, we report the induction of IRF-7 expression by TPA in U937 and HL60 cells and provide evidence indicating that the IRF-7 induction is essential for the monocyte differentiation to macrophages. Finally, we show that overexpression of IRF-7 alone is sufficient to trigger monocyte differentiation. Thus, we have identified a novel function of IRF-7 in innate immunity. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy donors by a density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Monocytes were further purified by attachment assay. The purity of isolated monocytes was determined by FACS (at least 90% positive for CD14). Macrophages were obtained by culturing adherent monocytes in tissue culture flask containing 1 ng/ml M-CSF (PEPROTECH) for 5 days in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 10% human serum (Gemini). U937 and 293T cells were purchased from ATCC. HL60 cells were generously provided by Dr. Saul Sharkis at The Johns Hopkins University. The retroviral construct, pBabe-ER, was a gift from Dr. Alan Friedman. It contains a modified murine estrogen receptor ligand binding domain (amino acids 281–599) that responds to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT) but not estradiol (20Wang X. Scott E. Sawyers C.L. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1999; 94: 560-571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human IRF-7 cDNA amplified by PCR was inserted into the polylinker region of the pBabe-ER vector to create a fusion protein of IRF-7 and estrogen receptor (pBabeIRF-7). As a control, an IRF-7 deletion mutant (IRF-7M) lacking the DNA binding domain was inserted into pBabe-ER (pBabeIRF-7M). The ψ-amphotropic helper DNA was a gift from Dr. O. Witte at UCLA. To generate IRF-7-containing retrovirus, 10 μg each of pBabeIRF-7 and ψ-amphotropic helper DNA were transiently transfected into 293T cells. Supernatant collected 48 h post-transfection was used to infect U937 cells. Transduced cells were selected in the presence of puromycin (1.5 μg/ml) added 48 h after transfection. 4 days after transfection, cells were stimulated with 4-HT (1 μm) for 3 days and then collected for analysis. The transfection efficiency of U937 cells was between 25 and 35%. Virus titers were at least 1 × 106 in NIH3T3 cells. Total cell RNA isolation by the Trizol method (Life Technologies, Inc.) and Northern blot analysis were described before (21Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The RT-PCR analysis (5 μg of total RNA) and the conditions of PCR amplification and the sequences of the primer sets for the amplification of β-actin, IFN-α/-β, and IRF-7 have been described elsewhere (22Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Pitha P.M. Virology. 2001; 280: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The primer sequences used for the amplification of IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-4, and IRF-8 cDNAs were as follows: IRF1, sense, 5′GCCAGTCGACGAGGATGAGGAAGGGAA3′; antisense, 5′CCAGCGGCCGCCTGCTACGGTGCACAGGGGAAA3′; IRF2, sense, 5′CCAGTCGACACCATGCCGG3′; antisense, 5′CCAGCGGCCGCGGCTTAACAGCTCTTGAC-3′; IRF4, sense, 5′CCAGTCGACGCAAGCTCTTTGACACAC3′; antisense, 5′CCAGCGGCCGCCTTTTCATTCTTGAATAG3′; IRF8, sense, 5′GCCGAATTCTCCGAGAGCTGCAGCA-3′; antisense, 5′-CGGCTCGAGGCTTAGACGG- TGATC-3′. Nuclear extracts of the cells were prepared as described before (21Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). 15 μg of total nuclear extract was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, and the levels of IRF-7 protein were identified by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). IRF-7DN expression plasmid, containing the N-terminal region of IRF-7 (amino acids 1–237), was generated as described before (22Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Pitha P.M. Virology. 2001; 280: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and transfected into U937 cells via electroporation. The transfected cells were selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418. A total of 20 clones were screened, and the positive clones (five in total) were pooled together for further analysis. Cells were resuspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. phosphatidylethanolamine-labeled CD11b and CD11c antibodies were added into cell suspension according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 30 min of incubation, the cells were analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson) using Cell Quest software. CD11b, CD11c, and 7-AAD (for dead cell exclusion) were purchased from Pharmingen. For the cell cycle analysis, the cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 3.7% formaldehyde, and 11 μg/ml of Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). The cell cycle profiles were obtained by FACScan (Becton Dickinson). The phagocytosis assay was performed as described before (23Chang D.H. Angelin-Duclos C. Calame K. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 2: 169-176Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC S. aureus 502A) was labeled by 0.01% fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I (Sigma) and sonicated and opsonized with an equal volume of human serum at 37 °C for 30 min. Bacteria at a final concentration of ∼1 × 108 cells/ml were incubated with 10 ml of medium at 37 °C for 2 h. Bacterial phagocytosis by cells was analyzed by FACScan. U937 and HL60 are the promonocytic cell lines that can differentiate into macrophages in the presence of TPA. The involvement of IRF family transcription factors in the macrophage differentiation is well documented. Using an antisense approach, IRF-1 has been reported to play an important role in the TPA-induced U937 cell differentiation (24Manzella L. Conte E. Cocchiaro G. Guarniera E. Sciacca B. Bonaiuto C. Stagno F. Messina A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3009-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). IRF-8−/− mice exhibit a profound defect in macrophage differentiation that was corrected by re-introduction of IRF-8 (4Mittrucker H.W. Matsuyama T. Grossman A. Kundig T.M. Potter J. Shahinian A.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 155-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Ets family transcription factor PU.1, which dimerizes with IRF-4, has also been implicated in the macrophage differentiation (26DeKoter R.P. Walsh J.C. Singh H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4456-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We examined the expression profile of the IRFs during the differentiation of U937 cells to gain further insights into their roles in U937 cell differentiation. The RT-PCR analysis (Fig.1 A) shows that there were no significant changes of IRF-1 and IRF-2 mRNA expression after TPA treatment. Although IRF-4 mRNA could be detected neither before nor after TPA treatment, the levels of IRF-8 expression decreased after TPA treatment. In contrast, the relative levels of IRF-7 mRNA increased significantly after TPA treatment, suggesting a unique role of IRF-7 in the differentiation of U937 cells. Next, the induction of IRF-7 expression by TPA was analyzed in detail in U937 cells. TPA treatment increased IRF-7 mRNA levels in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 1 B). The induction of IRF-7 mRNA became detectable 12 h after TPA treatment, peaked after 1 day and went down slightly at day 2 and day 3, and increased again at day 5 and day 6. TPA also induced the levels of IRF-7 protein in the nucleus in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 1 B). The relative levels of IRF-7 mRNA and protein were also induced by TPA treatment in HL60 cells (Fig. 1 C). Finally, IRF-7 mRNA and protein could also be detected in human primary macrophages (Fig.1 D). The constitutive expression of IRF-7 was shown to rapidly increased upon stimulation by viral infection, LPS, latent membrane protein-1, and IFN-α/-β (6Zhang L. Pagano J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5748-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 8Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Here we report for the first time that TPA treatment induces IRF-7 expression. There is a slight increase in expression of IFN-α/-β genes in TPA-treated U937 cells at day 6 (Fig. 1 A); however, because the increase in relative levels of IRF-7 mRNA preceded the induction of IFN genes, these data indicate that the induction of IRF-7 by TPA is not mediated by interferon. In summary, our results clearly show that the expression of IRF-7 is stimulated during TPA-induced monocyte differentiation. To determine whether IRF-7 plays a role in the monocyte differentiation, we stably transfected into U937 cells the N-terminal portion of IRF-7 (amino acids 1–237) containing the DNA binding domain but lacking the C-terminal protein association domain. This truncated IRF-7 has been shown to behave like a dominant negative mutant capable of inhibiting virus-mediated induction of the endogenous IFN-α/-β genes. (22Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Pitha P.M. Virology. 2001; 280: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The clones expressing IRF-7DN were pooled, and the pooled transfectants were analyzed. The expression of IRF-7DN in the pool of transfectant was about 3-fold higher than that of IRF-7 in TPA-treated U937 cells (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether the expression of IRF-7DN affects TPA-induced differentiation of U937 cells, IRF-7DN-expressing cells were treated with TPA for 3 days, and the expression of monocyte differentiation makers, CD11b and CD11c, was analyzed by FACS analysis. Expression of these two markers was also analyzed in U937 cells and in cells transfected with empty vector. Morphologically, 1 day after TPA treatment 80% of control U937 cells became adherent, and at day 3 all the cells adhered. In contrast, about 40–50% of IRF-7DN-expressing cells still remained in suspension at day 3, indicating an impact of IRF-7DN expression on U937 cell differentiation. Consistent with the morphological changes, the FACS analysis showed further a dramatic decrease in CD11b and CD11c expression in the IRF-7DN-expressing cells. Compared with the TPA-treated control U937 cells, the percentage of cells stained positive for CD11b decreased from 83.1% in U937 cells to 52.5% in U937 expressing IRF-7DN, and the percentage of cells stained positive for CD11c decreased from 90.3% in controls to 45.8% in IRF-7DN cells (Fig. 2 A) These data indicate an impaired monocyte differentiation in the presence of IRF-7DN and the requirement for IRF-7 for the differentiation of U937 cells. Next, we have examined whether the expression of IRF-7DN affected the full macrophage differentiation program or only on a selective set of differentiation marker genes. One hallmark of macrophage differentiation and function is the ability to phagocytose foreign antigens. Therefore, we compared the phagocytic abilities of control U937- and IRF-7DN-expressing cells after TPA treatment. The expression of IRF-7DN significantly impaired the phagocytic ability of the TPA-treated U937 cells (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate the critical role of IRF-7 in the U937 cell differentiation into functional macrophages. However the IRF-7DN mutant shares a DNA binding site with other IRFs, such as IRF-1 and IRF-8, that have been also implicated in monocyte differentiation. We cannot exclude the possibility that the observed impairment of monocytes differentiation by IRF-7DN is not entirely specific for IRF-7 and could also be a result of the interference with the functions of other IRFs. To determine whether IRF-7 overexpression is sufficient to drive the differentiation of U937 cells, we transduced retrovirus harboring IRF-7 into U937 cells. The retrovirus used was based on vector in which IRF-7 was inserted, upstream of and in frame with, an estrogen receptor ligand binding domain, which, when expressed, generates an IRF-7ER fusion protein that requires 4-HT for activation. After infection the transduced U937 cells were selected in the presence of puromycin and were cultivated in the presence of 4-HT for 3 days. The differentiation to macrophages was monitored by the expression of monocyte differentiation markers CD11b and CD11c by FACS analysis. Whereas in U937 cells 4HT treatment did not modulate expression of these antigens, 4-HT treatment of IRF-7-transduced U937 cells significantly increased the percentage of cells stained positive for CD11b (from 24.6 to 75.4%) and CD11c (from 15.6 to 70.8%) (Fig. 3 A) indicating that overexpression of IRF-7 triggers the differentiation of U937 cells. To further confirm that the effect is specific for IRF-7, U937 cells were transduced with pBabeIRF-7M, a mutant construct in which the DNA binding domain of IRF-7 was deleted. As shown in Fig.3 A, there were no significant changes in the expression of CD11b and CD11c in U937 cells transduced with IRF-7M after 4-HT treatment. These results suggest that IRF-7 overexpression triggered the monocyte differentiation and that the DNA binding domain of IRF-7 is required for this activity. This experiments also rules out the possible involvement of ER protein in the differentiation process. The relative levels of IRF-7ER in transduced cells were comparable with the levels of IRF-7 in TPA-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). To address the molecular mechanism of the IRF-7-mediated differentiation, we have examined the level of expression of IRFs and IFN-α/-β genes in the IRF-7-overexpressing and IRF-7DN-expressing U937 cells (after 3 days of 4-HT or TPA treatment, respectively). The results of RT-PCR analysis shown in Fig. 3 C indicate that the expression profiles of IRF-1, IRF-2, and IRF-8 are similar to those detected in TPA-stimulated U937 cells (see Fig. 1 A), suggesting that overexpression of IRF-7 or IRF-7DN mutant did not affect levels of expression of IRF-1, -2, and -8. However, the levels of IFN-α/-β transcripts were decreased in the TPA-treated IRF-7DN-expressing cells, and the expressions of IFN-α/-β genes were significantly increased after 4-HT treatment in the IRF-7-overexpressing cells (compare with the Fig. 1 A). However, exogenous IFN-α (500 units/ml) did not stimulate differentiation of U937 cells (data not shown). Further studies will be required to determine whether induction of type I IFN by IRF-7 plays a significant role in the differentiation of U937 cells. Differentiation-inducing agents are known to have a negative effect on cell growth. Here we sought to determine whether the differentiation-promoting effect of IRF-7 is associated with the inhibition of cell proliferation. For this purpose, we examined the cell cycle distribution of TPA-treated control cells and cells expressing IRF-7DN. In addition, the cell cycle profiles of IRF-7-expressing U937 cells were also analyzed in the presence or absence of 4-HT. As seen in Fig. 3 D, in U937 cells treatment with TPA for 3 days decreased the percentage of cells in S phase from 43.3 (control cells) to 6.4%, whereas the cells in G1phase increased from 38.7 (control cells) to 78.3%, indicating that TPA treatment induced a cell cycle arrest. However, in U937 cells expressing IRF-7DN TPA treatment did not results in significant changes. As many as 34.2% of IRF-7DN cells were still in S phase, and only 56.8% of IRF-7DN cells stayed in G1 phase after TPA treatment, indicating that unlike the U937 cells, the IRF-7DN-expressing U937 cells were still able to proliferate in the presence of TPA. Consistent with the findings is cell cycle analysis of IRF-7-overexpressing U937 cells. In these cells only 13.4% of 4-HT-treated cells (3 days treatment) were in S phase compared with 39.0% of untreated cells. Also 67.1% of 4-HT-treated cells and only 47.3% of untreated cells were in G1 phase. These results indicates that overexpression of IRF-7 is sufficient to induce a cell cycle arrest. It should be also pointed out that we did not detect prominent apoptosis in IRF-7-overexpressing cells in this analysis (data not shown). However the IRF-7-overexpressing U937 cells showed some distinct morphological differences from the TPA-treated cells. For example, even though most of the IRF-7-expressing cells showed different degrees of membrane and cytoplasmic ruffling like TPA-treated cells, only a small amount of IRF-7-transduced cells (about 15%) became adherent after 4-HT treatment. This suggests TPA treatment induces additional factors, which, together with IRF-7, may constitute an optimal environment for monocytes to differentiate. Nevertheless, our data clearly demonstrate the essential role of IRF-7 in monocyte differentiation as evidenced by the requirement for IRF-7 in U937 cell differentiation and by the fact that overexpression of IRF-7 alone was sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest and macrophage differentiation. It has been known that circulating monocytes can be recruited by inflammatory and immune stimuli to the site of infection and give rise to activated macrophages. Activated macrophages elicit many functions that are essential for the host defense against infection. The molecular mechanisms that result in the differentiation of newly recruited monocytes once they have left the circulation are still not clearly understood. It is generally believed that the local environment, especially the cytokines milieu, plays a key role in this differentiation (28Fantuzzi L. Conti L. Gauzzi M.C. Eid P. Del Corno M. Varano B. Canini I. Belardelli F. Gessani S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 391-399PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of IRF-7 in the innate immunity has been illustrated by its involvement in the induction of interferon and cytokine gene expression. The finding that IRF-7 is also required for monocyte differentiation has been unexpected. Even more surprising has been the demonstration that overexpression of IRF-7 could alone stimulate monocyte differentiation. Previous studies have shown that transcription factors Blimp-1 (24Manzella L. Conte E. Cocchiaro G. Guarniera E. Sciacca B. Bonaiuto C. Stagno F. Messina A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3009-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), HOXA10 (29Bromleigh V.C. Freedman L.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2581-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and WT1 (Wilms ×tumor suppressor) (30Ellisen L.W. Carlesso N. Cheng T. Scadden D.T Haber D.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1897-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), when overexpressed in U937 cells, can induce their differentiation. IRF-7 is generally expressed in cells at very low levels but can be rapidly induced by interferon and inflammatory stimuli such as virus infection, LPS, and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. 2Unpublished data. This ability to respond to inflammatory stimuli distinguishes IRF-7 from the other transcription factors mentioned above and indicates a possible unique role of IRF-7 in monocyte differentiation. Another IRF, IRF-8, was shown to be required for differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells into macrophages (25Tamura T. Nagamura-Inoue T. Shmeltzer Z. Kuwata T. Ozato K. Immunity. 2000; 13: 155-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and has been implicated in myeloid cell malignancies. We have observed that IRF-7 expression was silenced by promoter hypermethylation in some cancer cells (21Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Given the role of IRF-7 in monocyte differentiation and the well documented connection between the perturbed myeloid cell differentiation and leukemia (31Tenen D.G. Hromas R. Licht J.D. Zhang D.E. Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is tempting to ask whether disregulation of IRF-7 expression such as by promoter hypermethylation could play a role in leukemogenesis. Future efforts will be devoted to examine this possibility and to identify IRF-7 target genes. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that IRF-7 is not only necessary but also sufficient to induce differentiation in U937 monocytes to macrophages. We thank Drs. Wei-chun Au, Alan Friedman, Saul Sharkis, and O. Witte for providing the reagents used in this study, Dr. Timothy Alce for critical reading of the manuscript, and Merrill Kellum for excellent technical assistance.

The wild type and mutated receptors were expressed in COS-7 cells and characterized for their ligand binding properties and ability to increase inositol phosphate accumulation. The experimental results have been interpreted in the context of both an ab initio model of the α1b-AR and of a new homology model built on the recently solved crystal structure of rhodopsin. Among the twenty-three basic amino acids mutated only mutations of three, Arg254 and Lys258 in the third intracellular loop and Lys291 at the cytosolic extension of helix 6, markedly impaired the receptor-mediated inositol phosphate production. Additionally, mutations of two conserved hydrophobic residues, Val147 and Leu151 in the second intracellular loop had significant effects on receptor function. The functional analysis of the receptor mutants in conjunction with the predictions of molecular modeling supports the hypothesis that Arg254, Lys258, as well as Leu151 are directly involved in receptor-G protein interaction and/or receptor-mediated activation of the G protein.

Stimulation of the α1b-AR by catecholamines activates proteins of the Gq family, resulting in the production of inositol phosphates (IP) via the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) (1Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GPCRs are structurally characterized by seven transmembrane α-helices connected by alternating extracellular (e) and intracellular (i) loops. While the extracellular portion of these receptors is primarily involved in ligand binding, the cytosolic loops mediate the interaction of the receptors with a number of signaling and regulatory proteins, including G proteins, arrestins, and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (reviewed in Ref. 2Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that a conformational adjustment within the helical bundle of the receptor underlies the process of agonist-induced activation of GPCRs (reviewed in Ref. 3Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The current hypothesis is that the transition from the inactive (R) to active (R*) state of a GPCR results in receptor interaction with, and activation of, a G protein. Thus a GPCR-mediated biological response involves a series of events (i.e. receptor activation, receptor-G protein interaction, and receptor-induced G protein activation) for which a detailed mechanism still remains elusive at the molecular level. Although residues located in the helical bundle and at the boundary between the membrane and the cytosol may play a role in the “conformational switch” underlying receptor activation, amino acids in the intracellular loops are believed to be more directly involved in receptor-G protein interaction and/or receptor-induced G protein activation. The combination of these two latter events, which cannot be unequivocally separated experimentally, is generally indicated with the term of receptor-G protein coupling. We have previously provided evidence that the negatively and positively charged amino acids of the conserved DRY motif at the cytosolic end of helix 3 play a key role in the activation process of the α1b-AR (4Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 5Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. Proc. Natl.

Following a combination of experimental and computer-simulated mutagenesis of the α1b-AR, we have hypothesized that protonation of the aspartate (Asp142) and a shift of the arginine (Arg143) out of a conserved “polar pocket” are crucial steps in the transition of the receptor from the inactive (R) to active (R*) state (4Scheer A.

Several studies have tried to identify the amino acids of different GPCRs involved in G protein coupling at both experimental (as reviewed in Ref. 2Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and theoretical levels (7Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Cohen F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The majority of these studies indicate that sequences in the i2 loop as well as in the N and C termini of the i3 loop play an important role in the efficiency of receptor-G protein coupling and/or in the selectivity of receptor-G protein recognition. BBXXB or BBXB motifs located in different cytosolic loops (where B is any basic amino acid and X is any residue) have been implicated in the coupling of a number of GPCRs to G proteins (11Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hogger P. Shockley M.S. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 140-148PubMed Google Scholar). However, this motif has not been found to be universally important for all GPCRs. Other studies have identified hydrophobic amino acids as contributing to the receptor-G protein interface (14Moro O. Lameh J. Hogger P. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22273-22276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Arora K.K. Sakai A. Catt K.J. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 351-358PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, what has become abundantly clear is that there is no simple sequence determinant that can be attributed to receptor-G protein coupling. In a recent modeling study (8Fanelli F. Menziani C. Scheer A. Cotecchia S. De Benedetti P.G. Proteins. 1999; 37: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), docking simulations between active forms of the α1b-AR and a Gq heterotrimer led us to suggest that the positive surface of the cytosolic portion of GPCRs could complement a negative surface found on different G protein α subunits and thereby play a role in receptor-G protein coupling. However, the docking simulations also suggested that, despite the large number of cationic amino acids, only some might interact with anionic residues in the Gq α-subunit. To investigate the role of cationic residues in receptor-G protein coupling, we have mutated all the basic amino acids located in the i1, i2, and i3 loops of the α1b-AR and investigated the effect of these mutations on receptor-mediated production of IP. In addition, we have also characterized the effects resulting from mutations of conserved hydrophobic residues in the cytosolic portion of the receptor. Our findings demonstrate that mutations of the basic residues in the cytosolic portion of the receptor have wide ranging phenotypes. Only mutations of three (Arg254, Lys258, and Lys291) out of the twenty-three basic amino acids studied impaired the receptor-mediated signaling response. We also demonstrate an important role for two highly conserved hydrophobic residues in receptor function. The effect of these mutations has been evaluated in the context of both the ab initio model previously described (17Fanelli F. Menziani C. Scheer A. Cotecchia S. De Benedetti P.G. Methods. 1998; 14: 302-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and a new model of the α1b-AR built on the recently solved 2.8-Å crystal structure of rhodopsin (18Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD); DMEM, gentamicin, fetal bovine serum, and restriction enzymes from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY);Pwo polymerase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals(Mannheim, Germany); [125I]HEAT and [3H]inositol from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA); epinephrine was from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), and prazosin from Research Biochemical International. The cDNA of the hamster α1b-AR (19Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1633-1639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was mutated using PCR-mediated mutagenesis and Pwo DNA polymerase. The constructs were subcloned in the pRK5 expression vector, and mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Microsynth GmbH, Switzerland). COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (100 μg/ml) and transfected using the DEAE-dextran method. For inositol phosphate determination, COS-7 cells (0.15 × 106) were seeded in 12-well plates. The quantity of transfected receptor encoding DNA was 0.3–3 μg/106 cells. Membrane preparations derived from cells expressing the α1b-AR or its mutants and ligand binding assays using [125I]HEAT were performed as previously described (19Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1633-1639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prazosin (10−6m) was used to determine nonspecific binding. [125I]HEAT at a concentration of 250 pm was used for measuring receptor expression at a single concentration and 80 pm for competition binding analysis. Saturation analysis and competition curves were analyzed using Prism 3.02 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Transfected cells were labeled for 12 h with myo-[3H]inositol at 4 μCi/ml in inositol-free DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were preincubated for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm LiCl and then stimulated for 45 min with different concentrations of epinephrine from 10−10 to 10−4m. Total inositol phosphates were extracted and separated as described previously (19Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Kjelsberg M.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1633-1639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ab initio modeling of the α1b-AR receptor was achieved following the iterative procedure previously described (17Fanelli F. Menziani C. Scheer A. Cotecchia S. De Benedetti P.G. Methods. 1998; 14: 302-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The wild type α1b-AR input structure was selected from among over 200 tested input arrangements according to both internal and external consistency criteria and was used to produce the input structures for the receptor mutants. These structures were obtained by substituting the mutated residue in the wild type input structure by means of the molecular graphics package QUANTA (release 98; Molecular Simulations Inc., Waltham, MA). Minimization and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the receptor models were performed using the program CHARMm (Molecular Simulations Inc), following the computational protocol previously described (17Fanelli F. Menziani C. Scheer A. Cotecchia S. De Benedetti P.G. Methods. 1998; 14: 302-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In a previous study MD runs of 1050 ps were performed to compare the dynamic features of the wild type receptor with those of the constitutively active mutants (8Fanelli F. Menziani C. Scheer A. Cotecchia S. De Benedetti P.G. Proteins. 1999; 37: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because the first 100 ps of the equilibrated trajectory were sufficiently representative of the whole trajectory and given the high number of mutants considered in this study, MD runs of 150 ps were generally performed following the same heating and equilibration set-up as that employed for the longer MD simulations. The results reported were collected every 0.5 ps during the last 100 ps of the equilibrated MD trajectory. Finally, for each mutant the structure averaged over the 200 structures stored during the production phase were used for the comparative analysis. The average minimized structure of the wild type α1b-AR showed a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 3.94 Å from the rhodopsin structure, the deviation being larger (r.m.s.d. = 4.85 Å) before calculations. r.m.s.d. levels were computed by superimposing the main chain atoms of segments 37–62, 74–100, 111–133, 152–171, 202–225, 253–276, and 286–306, representing the seven transmembrane helices of rhodopsin, with those in the homologous segments 45–70, 82–107, 119–141, 161–180, 202–225, 295–318, and 328–348 of the average minimized structure of the wild type α1b-AR. Another model of the α1b-AR was built by comparative modeling (20Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10609) Google Scholar) using the recently determined 2.8-Å x-ray structure of rhodopsin (18Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H.

Eight different chimeric α1b-AR/rhodopsin templates (shown in the supplementary material) were constructed in which the e2, the i3, and in some cases only the i2 loop were extracted from the input structure of theab initio model of the α1b-AR. Furthermore, in the chimeras helix 5 has been elongated by 10 amino acids using the α1b-AR sequence after deleting the 226–235 rhodopsin segment. Finally, an α-helical segment of 6 amino acids using the α1b-AR sequence has been added to the N terminus of the helix 6 of rhodopsin after deleting the 240–248 rhodopsin segment. For each of the eight different templates, MODELLER generated 25 models. Among the 200 models finally obtained, 20 models were selected showing low restraint violations and low numbers of main-chain and side-chain bad conformations or close contacts. These models were completed by the addition of the polar hydrogen's and subjected to automatic and manual rotation of the side-chain torsion angles when in bad conformations, as well as to energy minimization and MD simulations according to the computational protocol employed for simulating the ab initioα1b-AR model. Different combinations of intra-helix distance constraints were also probed. About 450 MD trial runs were done to select the proper input structure for the wild type α1b-AR. The final input structure selected that was obtained using the alignment (see the supplementary material) was then used for generating the input structures for the receptor mutants. The structures of the wild type receptor and its mutants averaged over the last 100 ps of the 150 ps MD trajectory were finally minimized and considered for the comparative analysis. The input structure of the wild type α1b-AR showed an r.m.s.d. of 0.17 Å from the rhodopsin structure (r.m.s.d. was computed by employing the matching criteria described above for the ab initio model). This deviation increases to 2.07 Å upon energy minimization and MD simulations, becoming quite close to the value that would be expected given a sequence identity of 22.4% between the transmembrane segments of the α1b-AR and rhodopsin (21Chothia C. Lesk A.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). The wild type and mutated α1b-ARs were expressed in COS-7 cells and tested for their ability to bind the radioligand [125I]HEAT and epinephrine. Saturation binding experiments indicated that theK D of [125I]HEAT was ∼80 pm for all the receptors studied (results not shown), whereas the IC50 values for epinephrine varied as indicated in Table I. The affinity of prazosin for the different receptor mutants was similar to that for the wild type α1b-AR (results not shown). Receptor coupling to the Gq/PLC pathway was assessed as the ability of the receptor mutants to mediate epinephrine-stimulated IP accumulation (Table I). Transfections using 3 μg of DNA per 1 × 106 cells resulted in the expression of all receptor mutants at levels ranging from 60 to over 250 fmol/well. In each experiment, the wild type α1b-AR was expressed using varying quantities of DNA (0.3, 1.3, and 3 μg of DNA/1 × 106 cells) resulting in low (between 60 and 100 fmol/well), medium (between 100 and 200 fmol/well), and high (between 200 and 300 fmol/well) levels of expression. This allowed us to always be able to directly compare the properties of the mutated receptors with those of the wild type α1b-AR expressed at comparable levels within the same experiment.Table IFunctional properties of the α 1b -AR and its mutantsReceptorExpressionBasal IPEpi-stimulated IPIC50 EpiEC50 Epifmol/well%%μmnmWT (high expression)264 ± 3636 ± 16365 ± 125.9 ± 0.3638 ± 6WT (ave. expression)158 ± 1033 ± 16303 ± 50WT (low expression)63 ± 821 ± 6148 ± 30D142A110 ± 27269 ± 891-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.634 ± 1360.22 ± 0.061-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.ND1-bND, not determined.A293E121 ± 73352 ± 431-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.852 ± 1041-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.0.1 ± 0.021-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.NDR74E182 ± 2210 ± 6296 ± 237.3 ± 0.238 ± 3H75E180 ± 3716 ± 7267 ± 215.9 ± 0.956 ± 2R77E87 ± 1529 ± 2248 ± 335.7 ± 0.3110 ± 25R74E/R77E28 ± 411 ± 884 ± 125.7 ± 0.514 ± 6R74E/H75E93 ± 1024 ± 7217 ± 834.9 ± 0.810 ± 6R148E198 ± 16219 ± 421-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.537 ± 721-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.2.6 ± 0.848 ± 15R159E232 ± 3938 ± 7635 ± 2101-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.2.7 ± 0.828 ± 10R160E285 ± 3682 ± 40528 ± 761-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.7.4 ± 0.728 ± 5R148E/R159E/R160E77 ± 21180 ± 961-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.636 ± 1701-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.7.4 ± 0.519 ± 2K161E79 ± 1661 ± 311037 ± 4751-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.3.1 ± 0.0633 ± 7K231E182 ± 41117 ± 241-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.678 ± 561-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.4.1 ± 0.316 ± 3R232E153 ± 3553 ± 3632 ± 701-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.2.4 ± 0.674 ± 20K235E121 ± 2720 ± 4360 ± 275 ± 0.223 ± 3K243E145 ± 5214 ± 9284 ± 836.4 ± 0.2100 ± 15K249E147 ± 4331 ± 9881 ± 551-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.3.9 ± 1.132 ± 10R254E187 ± 358 ± 5109 ± 161-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.2.9 ± 0.8NDR254A118 ± 388 ± 4125 ± 151-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.3.5 ± 0.121 ± 7K258E179 ± 3914 ± 5165 ± 797.3 ± 0.6NDK258A103 ± 3127 ± 20356 ± 835 ± 0.0348 ± 12R254E/K258E162 ± 4215 ± 530 ± 121-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.10 ± 0.3NDR254A/K258A125 ± 3711 ± 781 ± 201-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.4.4 ± 0.5NDR254E/K258E/D142A79 ± 314 ± 325 ± 51-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.0.22 ± 0.061-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.NDR254E/K258E/A293E177 ± 2716 ± 445 ± 121-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.0.12 ± 0.011-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.NDK269E127 ± 3932 ± 20387 ± 1326.4 ± 0.670 ± 8K271E70 ± 3013 ± 18344 ± 681-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.6.1 ± 0.522 ± 5R276E82 ± 2810 ± 7327 ± 521-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.7.2 ± 0.0388 ± 9K282E182 ± 3411 ± 8314 ± 1186.2 ± 0.0625 ± 7K285E116 ± 3219 ± 4493 ± 1411-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.3.3 ± 0.325 ± 5R288A130 ± 2847 ± 12280 ± 1843.8 ± 0.423 ± 6R288E134 ± 3055 ± 6266 ± 544.4 ± 0.0657 ± 4K290E113 ± 3453 ± 12565 ± 901-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.1.3 ± 0.234 ± 5K291A142 ± 2914 ± 4107 ± 171-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.8 ± 1.5NDK291E177 ± 444 ± 277 ± 241-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.6.3 ± 0.7NDR288A/K291A112 ± 3126 ± 9117 ± 71-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.3.1 ± 0.2NDR288E/K291E161 ± 314 ± 181 ± 191-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.1.7 ± 0.2NDR288E/K291E/D142A102 ± 4120 ± 676 ± 221-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.0.22 ± 0.031-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.NDR288E/K291E/A293E137 ± 2948 ± 10299 ± 760.45 ± 0.11-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.NDK294E118 ± 389 ± 5372 ± 845.3 ± 0.0357 ± 15Y144A62 ± 579 ± 201-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.767 ± 1491-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.3.5 ± 0.422 ± 8V147A94 ± 13440 ± 1601-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.744 ± 1731-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.0.03 ± 0.011-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.86 ± 15V147E66 ± 77 ± 38 ± 61-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.0.02 ± 0.011-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.NDV147E/A293E84 ± 188 ± 346 ± 81-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.0.06 ± 0.011-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.NDL151A169 ± 3328 ± 4114 ± 71-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.5.3 ± 0.1NDL151D208 ± 3416 ± 650 ± 171-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.6.9 ± 0.8NDL151D/A293E161 ± 1048 ± 12134 ± 121-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.0.04 ± 0.011-ap < 0.05 paired Student's t test.NDThe wild type α1b-AR (WT) and its mutants were expressed in COS-7 cells.

Fig. 1 shows the localization of the amino acids mentioned in this study within a simplified topographical scheme of the α1b-AR based on its sequence alignment with bovine rhodopsin. The mutated amino acids are colored according to the functional effects induced upon their mutation. The first intracellular loop of the α1b-AR as with most GPCRs is short, being predicted to consist of just six amino acids (Fig. 1). Within this region there are three basic residues (Arg74, His75, and Arg77) forming a BBXXB/BBXB motif that has been described as important in the coupling of some receptors to G proteins. The individual mutations of Arg74, His75, and Arg77 into Glu did not result in any significant change in the ligand binding properties of the receptors or in their ability to mediate epinephrine-induced IP accumulation (TableI). To investigate whether the loss of more than a single basic residue had a greater effect than the single mutations, we generated the double mutants R74E/H75E and R74E/R77E. Both mutants displayed decreased levels of expression. However, their ability to mediate an agonist-induced IP response did not significantly differ from that of the wild type α1b-AR expressed at similar levels (TableI). It may therefore be concluded that the basic residues forming the BBXB motif in the i1 loop of the α1b-AR do not play a significant role in receptor-G protein coupling. These findings are in agreement with those from other studies on various GPCRs indicating that amino acids in the i1 loop are not important (22Shi W. Osawa S. Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2112-2119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Jin H. Nip S. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Biochim. Biophys.

The 13 amino acids that constitute the i2 loop of the α1b-AR and the cytosolic extension of helix 4 contain four cationic amino acids, Arg148, Arg159, Arg160, and Lys161. Within this region is found the DRYXX(V/I)XXXL motif identified as a common feature in the rhodopsin family of GPCRs and an essential part of the receptor activation mechanism (5Scheer A. Fanelli F.

Mutations of the four positively charged residues, Arg148, Arg159, Arg160, and Lys161, did not result in any change in the ligand binding properties of the receptor mutants (TableI). Only the triple mutant R148E/R159E/R160E displayed a 9-fold increase in affinity for epinephrine (Table I). Significantly, all the mutations resulted in an increased maximal epinephrine-stimulated activity of the receptor. However, the EC50 values of epinephrine for all the receptor mutants were similar to that of the wild type α1b-AR (Table I). The R148E mutant also displayed a significant 6-fold increase in its constitutive activity (Table I). Interestingly, when the sequence of the α1b-AR is aligned with those of the muscarinic M1, M3, and M5 receptors a homologous arginine is similarly located. Mutation of this arginine in the M5 muscarinic receptor to either Asp or Glu also produced constitutive activity (26Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol.

IFNα exerts antitumor action by inducing direct cytotoxicity against tumor cells. This toxicity is at least partly due to induction of apoptosis. Although the molecular basis of the inhibition of cell growth by IFNα is only partially understood, there is a direct correlation between the sensitivity of cells to the antiproliferative action of IFNα and the down-regulation of their mitochondrial mRNAs. Here, we studied the role of the 2–5A/RNase L system and its inhibitor RLI in this regulation of the mitochondrial mRNAs by IFNα. We found that a fraction of cellular RNase L and RLI is localized in the mitochondria. Thus, we down-regulated RNase L activity in human H9 cells by stably transfecting (i) RNase L antisense cDNA or (ii) RLI sense cDNA constructions. In contrast to control cells, no post-transcriptional down-regulation of mitochondrial mRNAs and no cell growth inhibition were observed after IFNα treatment in these transfectants. These results demonstrate that IFNα exerts its antiproliferative effect on H9 cells at least in part via the degradation of mitochondrial mRNAs by RNase L.

Although originally discovered due to their participation in cellular defense against viral infection (1Isaacs A. Lindenmann J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1957; 147: 258-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IFNs are also known to modulate immune responses as well as control various cellular functions by altering the transcription of a large family of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (2Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar). IFNs are negative regulators of cell proliferation through induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which has also been suggested to be of central importance in IFN antitumor action. IFNα (type I family) has emerged as a tumor suppressor protein. A number of clinical trials were thus carried out in cancer therapy with IFNα alone or in combination with other negative regulators of cell proliferation (4Pelicano L. Chelbi A.M. Bull. Cancer (Paris). 1998; 85: 313-318PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lindner D.J. Hofmann E.R. Karra S. Kalvakolanu D.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has been shown to be effective against hematological malignancies including hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (6Gutterman J.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). IFNα has been used successfully in cancer therapy, but development of resistance to IFNα therapy has often been observed in patients. Although the molecular basis of the inhibition of cell growth by IFNα is partially understood, there is a correlation between the sensitivity of cells to the antiproliferative action of IFNα and the down-regulation of their mitochondrial mRNAs and the impairment of mitochondrial function upon IFNα treatment (7Lou J. Anderson S.L. Xing L. Rubin B.Y. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Lewis J.A. Huq A. Najarro P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13184-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this work, we have studied the role of one of the enzymatic pathways induced by IFNα, the 2–5A/RNase L pathway, in the regulation of mitochondrial mRNAs. The 2–5A/RNase L pathway is an RNA degradation pathway (9Silverman R.H. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structure and Functions. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 515-551Crossref Google Scholar). IFNα induces the expression of 2–5A synthetase(s) which, upon activation by double-stranded RNA, convert ATP into an unusual series of oligomers known as 2–5A (10Kerr I.M. Brown R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 11Rebouillat D. Hovanessian A.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). 2–5A activates RNase L, a latent endoribonuclease, which inhibits protein synthesis by cleaving mRNAs 3′ of UpNp (uracyl nucleotide, the nucleotide sequence of mRNA recognized by RNase L) sequences (12Floyd S.G. Slattery E. Lengyel P. Science. 1981; 212: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar,13Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). RNase L activity is also regulated by RNase L inhibitor (RLI), which inhibits 2–5A binding to RNase L, thereby switching off the 2–5A/RNase L system (14Bisbal C. Martinand C. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Salehzada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13308-13317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We postulated that RNase L may participate in the antiproliferative effect of IFNα by playing an important role in the IFNα-induced down-regulation of mitochondrial mRNAs, which leads to a decrease in cellular ATP levels and suppression of mitochondrial function (7Lou J. Anderson S.L. Xing L. Rubin B.Y. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Lewis J.A. Huq A. Najarro P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13184-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate the presence of RNase L and RLI in mitochondria. Furthermore we show that in IFNα-treated H9 cells, the level of mitochondrial mRNAs is a function of RNase L activity in the mitochondria. Inhibition of RNase L can prolong the stability of mitochondrial mRNAs. Human H9 cells (lymphoma, cutaneous T lymphocyte; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC): HTB-176), human HeLa cells (adenocarcinoma, cervix; ATCC: CCL-2), and human Daudi cells (Burkitt’s lymphoma, B lymphoblast; ATCC: CCL-213) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Cell growth was determined by counting viable cells as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Human IFNα (IFNα2) was used at 500 units/ml. The CCCP was added to culture media at 20 μm for the same period of time as IFNα treatment. The experiments were done in triplicate, and the S.D. is indicated on the plots. H9 cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4), pelleted, resuspended in 2 volumes of hypotonic buffer (0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), 20 mm Hepes pH 7.5, 10 mm potassium acetate, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 150 μg/ml leupeptin), incubated 10 min on ice, disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged 10 min at 10,000 × g. The obtained supernatant was designated post-nuclear extract. For mitochondria isolation, H9 cells (2.0 × 108 cells) were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in 5 ml of a 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 10 mm KCl, 0.15 mm MgCl2 solution. After incubation for 10 min on ice, cells were disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer and, after the addition of sucrose (0.25 mfinal concentration), centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min to remove the nuclei. The supernatant was complemented with K-EDTA (1 mm final concentration) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in cold buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0). The supernatant was named the cytoplasmic extract (without mitochondria). The mitochondria were purified on a 30% (v/v) Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) cushion in buffer A supplemented with 1 mm K-EDTA. The mitochondria were collected from the cushion and centrifuged to eliminate Percoll. Mitochondria were lysed by sonication, and the total mitochondrial extract was used for further experiments. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford reaction (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). The coding sequences of human RLI cDNA (14Bisbal C. Martinand C. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Salehzada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13308-13317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and human RNase L cDNA (13Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) were subcloned in pcDNA3neo (Invitrogen) by standard procedures (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 3-87Google Scholar). RLI sense/pcDNA3neo (7 μg), RNase L antisense/pcDNA3neo (7 μg), and the empty vector (7 μg) were transfected in H9 cells by electroporation as previously described (17Martinand C. Montavon C. Salehzada T. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 290-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected H9 cell clones were isolated by dilution of 1 cell/slot in 96-slot plates in the presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two clones were selected for each construction and named RLI S1 and RLI S2 for clones expressing sense RLI cDNA and RNase L AS1 and RNase L AS2 for clones expressing RNase L cDNA in the antisense orientation. An empty pcDNA3 vector-transfected clone was used as a control. Mitochondrial DNA was isolated from human Daudi cells by lysis in a 2% (w/v) SDS solution, two phenol dichloromethane extractions, and ethanol precipitation. Polymerase chain reaction was performed directly on mitochondrial DNA to amplify cytochromeb, ATPase 6, and cytochrome oxidase subunit II cDNA. Primer 1 (5′-GGGAATTCACAAGAACACCAATGACCCCAA-3′) and primer 2 (5′-GGGAATTCACAAGGACAGGCCCATTTGAGT-3′) were used to amplify cytochromeb cDNA. Primer 3 (5′-GGGAATTCCCAAAAATGAACGAAAATCTGTTC-3′) and primer 4 (5′-GGGAATTCTGGGTCATTATGTGTTGTCGTGC-3′) were used to amplify ATPase6 cDNA. Primer 5 (5′-GGGAATTCATCTTAATGGCACATGCAGCGC-3′) and primer 6 (5′-GGGAATTCTTTACAGTGGGCTCTAGAGGG-3′) were used to amplify cytochrome oxidase subunit II cDNA. RLIS1, RLIS2, RNase L AS1, RNase L AS2, and control cells were plated at 2.0 × 105 cells/ml, treated for 24 or 48 h by IFNα (500 units/ml), and collected for RNA extraction using the guanidine thiocyanate-lithium chloride procedure (18Cathala G. Savouret J.F. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA (N. Y.). 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg) were analyzed by Northern blot (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 3-87Google Scholar). After transfer onto nylon membranes (Appligen), rRNA were revealed with 0.5 m (sodium acetate) pH 5, 0.04% (w/v) methylene blue. The nylon membranes were then incubated with the appropriate [32P]cDNA probes (as indicated in the figure legends) synthesized using the Multiprime radiolabeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). After autoradiography on a PhosphorImager 445-SI (Molecular Dynamics), the mRNA were quantified by image analysis with the Image Quant program (Molecular Dynamics). The experiments were done in triplicate, and the S.D. is indicated on the plots. Proteins (100 μg of post-nuclear extract, 100 μg of cytoplasmic extract, 100 or 200 μg of mitochondrial extract) were fractionated by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) according to Towbin et al. (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44843) Google Scholar). For detection with antibody, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in PBS supplemented with 10% (w/v) skim milk powder for 30 min and then soaked overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer with the appropriate antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphodehydrogenase (anti-GAPDH) at 1:3000 dilution, rabbit polyclonal anti-RLI at 1:500 dilution (20Martinand C. Salehzada T. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal anti-RNase L at 1:1000 dilution (20Martinand C. Salehzada T. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal anti-MRLP12 at 1:5000 dilution. The membranes were washed with PBS supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody or with sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at 1:2000 dilution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chemiluminescence was generated by reaction with the PerkinElmer Life Sciences enhanced chemiluminescence kit. The autoradiographies were scanned, and proteins bands were quantified by image analysis with the Intelligent Quantifier program (BioImage Systems Corp.). The experiments were done in triplicate, and the S.D. is indicated on the plots. The radiolabeled 2–5A4-3′-[32P]pCp probe was oxidized at its 3′ end (21Bayard B. Bisbal C. Silhol M. Cnockaert J. Huez G. Lebleu B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This modified probe can be covalently linked to amine groups on RNase L and allows analysis by denaturing gel electrophoresis as initially described by Wreschner et al. (22Wreschner D.H. Silverman R.H. James T.C. Gilbert C.S. Kerr I.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with our modifications (23Bisbal C. Salehzada T. Lebleu B. Bayard B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Post-nuclear extracts (100 μg), cytoplasmic extracts (100 μg), or mitochondrial extracts (100 or 200 μg) were incubated with the oxidized 2–5A4-3′-[32P]pCp probe for 30 min in ice and for a further 20 min at room temperature with sodium cyanoborohydride (20 mm final concentration). Proteins were analyzed by 10% (v/v) SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were visualized after autoradiography, and proteins bands were quantified by image analysis with the Intelligent Quantifier program (BioImage Systems Corp.). The experiments were done in triplicate, and the S.D. is indicated on the plots. Human HeLa cells were cultivated at a concentration of 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum for 24 h. The cell culture medium was then changed to RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 100 nm MitoTracker dye (red CM-H2XRos, Molecular Probes), incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, washed at 37 °C with PBS, and incubated for 5 min at room temperature in PBS, 3.7% (v/v) formalin. After several washes with PBS, cells were incubated in PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 20 min, then in PBS, 10% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Cells were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a rabbit anti-RNase L polyclonal antibody at 1:200 dilution, washed with PBS, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:50 dilution, washed with PBS, fixed with MOWIOL (2.4 g of MOWIOL 4–88 in 6 g of glycerol, 6 ml of water, 12 ml of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5), and analyzed by confocal microscopy on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024. The experiments were done in triplicate. Immediately after purification, aliquots of the mitochondrial fraction (1 mg of mitochondrial protein) were resuspended in 0.5 ml of an incubation buffer containing 25 mm sucrose, 75 mm sorbitol, 100 mmKCl, 10 mm K2HPO4, 0.05 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ADP, 10 mm glutamate, 2.5 mmmalate, 10 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 μCi of [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) (25Enriquez J.A. Perez M.A. Lopez P.M. Montoya J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 50-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 60 min, and the mitochondrial samples were pelleted at 13,000 × g for 1 min to remove non-incorporated [32P]UTP. The mitochondria were resuspended in the incubation buffer described above in the presence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled UTP and incubated for increasing periods of time as indicated in the figure legends. Mitochondrial RNAs were extracted twice with an equal volume of a phenol/dichloromethane/isoamyl alcohol mixture (25:25:1; v/v) at room temperature. After ethanol precipitation of the aqueous phase and centrifugation, the nucleic acids pellet was dissolved in sterile water. The labeled transcripts from the different mitochondrial fractions were hybridized at 42 °C with mitochondrial cDNA spotted (5 μg) on a nitrocellulose membrane already prehybridized for 48 h in 50% (v/v) formamide, 50 mmNa2HPO4 pH 6.5, 0.8 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5× Denhardt’s, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 500 μg/ml baker yeast tRNA. After 48 h of hybridization, the membranes were washed for 10 min at 20 °C with 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 30 min at 65 °C with 0.2× SSC, 15 min at 37 °C with 2× SSC, RNase A (10 μg/ml), and 2 times for 30 min at 37 °C with 2× SSC (26Bonnieu A. Rech J. Jeanteur P. Fort P. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 881-888PubMed Google Scholar). After autoradiography on a PhosphorImager 445-SI (Molecular Dynamics), the mRNAs were quantified by image analysis with the Image Quant program (Molecular Dynamics). The experiments were done in triplicate, and the S.D. is indicated on the plots. Transcription of mitochondrial RNA was done on isolated mitochondria in the presence of 20 μCi of [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) as described in the previous paragraph (25Enriquez J.A. Perez M.A. Lopez P.M. Montoya J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 50-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondria were then resuspended in the incubation buffer described above in the presence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled UTP and incubated for increasing periods of time as indicated in the figure legends in the presence or absence of 2–5A4 (100 μm). Mitochondrial RNA was extracted, spotted, and analyzed as described above. As mentioned in the introduction, our working hypothesis is that down-regulation of mitochondrial mRNAs in IFNα-treated cells could be due to RNase L activation. For RNase L and RLI to act as regulators of mitochondrial mRNA stability they must, first, be present in mitochondria and, second, RNase L must be able to degrade mitochondrial mRNAs. In keeping with this hypothesis we provide the first evidence for the presence of RNase L and RLI in isolated mitochondria (Fig.1, panels A and B). RNase L was detected by radiocovalent affinity labeling, because the level of RNase L present in the mitochondria is lower than the detection threshold level on Western blot, using our polyclonal antibody against RNase L. Twenty-four hours of IFNα treatment increased mitochondrial quantities of RNase L but did not affect RLI level (panels A and B). The absence of GAPDH in the mitochondrial extract (panels A and C) indicated that there was no cytoplasmic contamination during mitochondrial fractionation. As a positive control of mitochondria isolation and purity, we probed the Western blot for MRLP12 protein, which is the mitochondrial mammalian homologue to chloroplastic and bacterial L12 ribosomal proteins (27Marty L. Fort P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11468-11476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To prove that RNase L and RLI are imported into mitochondria from the cytoplasm and that their detection in mitochondria is not due to nonspecific adsorption of these proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane, CCCP was used to abolish the membrane potential required for polypeptide import through the inner mitochondrial membrane (28Nelson N. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4365-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Reid G.A. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13056-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CCCP treatment of H9 cells decreased MRLP12 protein levels 4-fold, RNase L protein levels 8-fold, and RLI protein levels 2-fold in mitochondria, indicating that these proteins are imported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria (Fig. 1, panels C and D). No changes were observed in the cytoplasmic amounts of RNase L, RLI, or GAPDH after CCCP treatment. The presence of RNase L in mitochondria was also established by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. A fraction of the cellular RNase L population clearly co-localized with MitoTracker, a mitochondria-specific marker (30Gonzalez G.M. Perez B.R. Ding L. Duan L. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Nunez G. Development. 1994; 120: 3033-3042PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 32Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The yellow coloration (Fig.2, panel C) resulting from the combined fluorescence of MitoTracker (red fluorescence, Fig.2, panel A) and fluorescein linked to a secondary antibody against the rabbit anti-RNase L polyclonal antibody (green fluorescence, Fig. 2, panel B) clearly showed this co-localization. Because RNase L was present in the mitochondria, we proceeded with pulse-chase experiments on intact mitochondria isolated from H9 cells to confirm that mitochondrial mRNAs could be destabilized by mitochondrial RNase L. We followed the stability of radiolabeled mitochondrial mRNAs in the presence or not of 2–5A, the specific activator of RNase L (10Kerr I.M. Brown R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 13Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). As illustrated by the data in Fig.3, the addition of 2–5A to isolated intact mitochondria destabilizes mitochondrial mRNAs including cytochrome b, ATPase 6, and cytochrome oxidase subunit II. This result clearly shows that mitochondrial RNase L, once activated directly by 2–5A, can destabilize mitochondrial mRNAs. To study the potential role of RNase L and RLI in the down-regulation of mitochondrial mRNAs by IFNα, we reduced endogenous RNase L activity in human H9 T lymphocytes, chosen for their sensitivity to the antiproliferative effect of IFNα, by stably transfecting an RNase L cDNA antisense construct or an RLI sense cDNA construct. Two clones from each stable transfection were selected based on their decreased 2–5A binding capacity, as an indicator of diminished cellular RNase L activity and their RLI and RNase L protein content (Fig. 4). The two RLI sense cDNA transfectant clones (RLI S1 and RLI S2) expressed the same level of RNase L compared with the control cells but exhibited a 2-fold decrease in 2–5A binding activity due to RLI overexpression (Fig. 4, panels A and B). In these two clones, there was a strong correlation between RLI overexpression and down-regulation of RNase L 2–5A binding activity. In the two RNase L antisense cDNA transfectant clones (RNase L AS1 and RNase L AS2), decreased 2–5A binding activity correlated with lower expression levels of RNase L and no change in RLI expression levels. The level of GAPDH protein was constant in control and in transfected cells. These clones were treated with IFNα (500 units/ml) for 24 and 48 h, and their mitochondrial mRNAs levels were analyzed by Northern blot (Fig. 5). In the control H9 cells, IFNα treatment down-regulated several mitochondrial mRNAs such as cytochrome b, ATPase 6, and cytochrome oxidase subunit II, as previously observed in other cell types (7Lou J. Anderson S.L. Xing L. Rubin B.Y. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Lewis J.A. Huq A. Najarro P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13184-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Shan B. Vazquez E. Lewis J.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4307-4314Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the RLI S and RNase L AS transfectants, no decrease in these mitochondrial mRNAs was observed after IFNα treatment. The 6–16 mRNA, a known IFNα-induced gene, was correctly induced by IFNα treatment in all transfectants as in control cells and as previously described (34Kelly J.M. Porter A.C. Chernajovsky Y. Gilbert C.S. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), indicating that these cells responded to IFNα treatment. The level of 18 S rRNA was constant in control and in transfected cells. These experiments thus support a role of RNase L in the accelerated degradation of mitochondrial mRNAs in IFNα-treated cells. IFNα exerts an antiproliferative effect on various cell lines, and the down-regulation of mitochondrial mRNAs is only observed in cells sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of IFNα. There is a correlation between the antiproliferative response and the mitochondrial response (7Lou J. Anderson S.L. Xing L. Rubin B.Y. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Lewis J.A. Huq A. Najarro P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13184-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33Shan B. Vazquez E. Lewis J.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4307-4314Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This correlation and the fact that a decrease in mitochondrial mRNAs leads to a decrease in mitochondrial proteins and to a decrease in cellular ATP levels (7Lou J. Anderson S.L. Xing L. Rubin B.Y. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 8Lewis J.A. Huq A. Najarro P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13184-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) suggests that the down-regulation of mitochondrial mRNAs could participate in the growth inhibition induced by IFNα. Therefore, we charted the growth rate of H9 cells and H9 transfectants for 5 days after IFNα (500 units/ml) treatment. IFNα inhibited cell proliferation in the control H9 cells, transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 6, panel A). On the contrary, the H9 transfectants with no IFNα-induced down-regulation of mitochondrial mRNAs (Fig. 5) were resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of IFNα (Fig. 6, panels B–E). To determine whether there is a correlation between the down-regulation of mitochondrial mRNAs and RNase L activity in the mitochondria, we performed a radiocovalent affinity labeling assay on purified mitochondrial extracts from the H9 transfectants. Less 2–5A binding activity of RNase L was detected in the mitochondria of the H9 transfectants than in the control H9 cells (Fig.7, panels A and B). In the RLI S1 and RLI S2 clones, the decreased RNase L 2–5A binding activity correlated with an increased level of RLI in the mitochondria. In the RNase L AS1 and RNase L AS2 clones, the quantity of RLI found in mitochondria was the same as that in the control cells, indicating that the decrease of RNase L 2–5A binding activity is probably because of low levels of RNase L, as shown for total cell extract (Fig. 4). The absence of GAPDH confirms that there was no cytoplasmic contamination in the mitochondrial extract, and MRLP12 levels indicate that an equal amount of mitochondrial proteins was loaded for each transfectant. Because our data demonstrated that the 2–5A/RNase L/RLI pathway is involved in the down-regulation of mitochondrial mRNAs by IFNα (Fig. 5), that RNase L was present in the mitochondria, and that mitochondrial mRNAs can be destabilized by mitochondrial RNase L after its activation by 2–5A (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3), we postulated that mitochondrial RNase L may regulate mitochondrial mRNA stability in response to IFNα treatment. To verify this hypothesis, we compared the stability of radiolabeled mitochondrial mRNAs by pulse-chase analysis of intact mitochondria isolated from control H9 cells and from"

However, most bacteria generate one of the two amide aminoacyl-tRNAs, Asn-tRNA or Gln-tRNA, by transamidation of mischarged Asp-tRNAAsn or Glu-tRNAGlncatalyzed by a heterotrimeric amidotransferase (encoded by thegatA, gatB, and gatC genes). TheChlamydia trachomatis genome sequence reveals genes for 18 synthetases, whereas those for asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase are absent. Yet the genome harbors threegat genes in an operon-like arrangement (gatCAB). We reasoned that Chlamydia uses thegatCAB-encoded amidotransferase to generate both Asn-tRNA and Gln-tRNA. C. trachomatis aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and glutamyl-tRNA synthetase were shown to be non-discriminating synthetases that form the misacylated tRNAAsn and tRNAGln species. A preparation of pure heterotrimeric recombinant C. trachomatis amidotransferase converted Asp-tRNAAsn and Glu-tRNAGln into Asn-tRNA and Gln-tRNA, respectively. The enzyme used glutamine, asparagine, or ammonia as amide donors in the presence of either ATP or GTP. These results suggest that C. trachomatis employs the dual specificity gatCAB-encoded amidotransferase and 18 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to create the complete set of 20 aminoacyl-tRNAs.

Because there are 20 canonical amino acids in proteins, a corresponding set of 20 AA-tRNAs is required. Because many organisms contain 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, each capable of acylating the cognate tRNA with the correct amino acid (1Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), it was believed that this is the only path to AA-tRNA formation, as first proposed in the adaptor hypothesis (2Crick F.H.C. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1958; 12: 138-163PubMed Google Scholar). However, the idea that there are 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in all organisms has been challenged for many years beginning with the discovery of an alternative pathway to generate Gln-tRNA (3Wilcox M. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Initially this was thought to be an interesting abnormality. Recent biochemical and functional genomic studies have made it clear that the “20-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase rule” is preserved only in the eukaryotic cytoplasm, whereas most organisms have less than 20 synthetases (4Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The absence of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) is by far the most common exception to the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase rule. Most bacteria and all archaea known to date lack this enzyme. In addition, asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnRS) is absent in many archaea and also in some bacteria. Organisms lacking either AsnRS or GlnRS use a tRNA-dependent amino acid transformation pathway to generate Asn-tRNA or Gln-tRNA (Fig.1). This alternate pathway is based on two extraordinary enzyme activities. First, it requires the presence of two non-discriminating aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, a glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) and an aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS). Such a non-discriminating enzyme differs from the canonical synthetase by having relaxed tRNA specificity that enables it to acylate the cognate and a non-cognate tRNA with the cognate amino acid. For instance,Bacillus subtilis GluRS produces Glu-tRNAGln in addition to Glu-tRNAGlu (5Lapointe J. Duplain L. Proulx M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 88-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Non-discriminating AspRS enzymes have been shown in a number of archaea and bacteria (e.g. 6–8). Second, a tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT) must amidate the mischarged aspartate or glutamate to form the correctly acylated tRNAs (6Curnow A.W. Ibba M. Söll D.

Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 12Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Their corresponding subunits are encoded by the gatC,gatA, and gatB genes, which are arranged in an operon-like manner in the chromosomes of some bacteria. Biochemical characterization of these enzymes is still sketchy. However, the data suggest that GatA is the AdT catalytic subunit, that GatB is involved in recognition of the mischarged AA-tRNA, and that GatC is essential for proper expression and/or folding of a fully active GatA protein (10Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). All gatCAB-encoded bacterial AdTs studied to date are responsible only for in vivo synthesis of one of the two possible amide AA-tRNAs (employing Asp-AdT or Glu-AdT activity), whereas the other amide AA-tRNA is formed by direct aminoacylation by AsnRS or GlnRS. Looking at the available genomic sequences, 8 of 13 archaea lack both AsnRS and GlnRS but encode two different AdT enzymes for formation of Asn-tRNA and Gln-tRNA. The discovery of an archaeal heterodimeric GatDE amidotransferase specific for Gln-tRNA formation suggests that the two amide AA-tRNA species in archaea are very likely synthesized by two different AdTs (4Tumbula D.L. Becker H.D. Chang W.Z. Söll D. Nature. 2000; 407: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Bacterial genomes do not encode this latter enzyme. Nevertheless, complete genomes lacking identifiable GlnRS and AsnRS genes are known, such as Campylobacter jejuni, all known Chlamydia strains, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, andRickettsia prowazekii (14Raczniak G. Ibba M. Söll D. Toxicology. 2001; 160: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been shown in vitro that when provided with suitable heterologous substrates, the B. subtilis, Deinococcus radiodurans andThermus thermophilus GatCAB amidotransferases can synthesize both Asn-tRNA and Gln-tRNA even though they are only required to synthesize one of these AA-tRNAs in vivo (12Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 13Becker H.D. Min B. Jacobi C. Raczniak G. Pelaschier J. Roy H. Klein S. Kern D. Söll D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Using a heterologous substrate, the Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidansamidotransferase has been described as dual-specific. However, its genome sequence is not yet complete; thus this organism might still contain the canonical AsnRS or GlnRS activities, although they were not seen in cell extracts (15Salazar J.C. Zúñiga R. Raczniak G. Becker H. Söll D. Orellana O. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 129-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These data suggested that in organisms lacking both GlnRS and AsnRS, the gatCAB-encoded amidotransferase is an Asp/Glu-AdT that might provide both Asn-tRNA and Gln-tRNA for protein synthesis. Therefore, we decided to test this idea using Chlamydia trachomatis as a model. Here we report that pure C. trachomatis amidotransferase can amidateChlamydia Asp-tRNAAsn and Glu-tRNAGln generated by the homologous AspRS and GluRS enzymes. This suggests that this single amidotransferase is responsible for both Asn-tRNA and Gln-tRNA formation in this human pathogenic parasite. C. trachomatis genomic DNA was a gift of L. Olinger (16Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Science. 1998; 282: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by the Keck Foundation Research Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. The pBAD expression vector was from Invitrogen. The ceramic hydroxyapatite type I (5 ml) column was from Bio-Rad. HiTrap heparin (5 ml) and HiTrap Q (5 ml) columns were fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cellulose thin layer chromatography plates were from Macherey-Nagel. Epicurian Coli®BL21-CodonPlus™ competent cells were purchased from Stratagene. Preparations of Clostridium acetobutylicum AsnRS and AspRS2 and D. radiodurans AspRS2 were kindly given by Benfang Ruan and Joanne Pelaschier (Yale University) and D. radiodurans GluRS and Escherichia coli GlnRS were obtained from Dylan Chan, Hiroyuki Kobayashi, and Debra Tumbula-Hansen (Yale University). Nucleoside triphosphates were of sequencing grade, and HPLC analysis showed no cross-contamination. The tRNA genes (tRNAAsp, tRNAAsn, tRNAGlu, tRNAGln) were constructed in the pKK223–3 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by cassette cloning of oligonucleotides synthesized according to the tRNA sequence and their complement and subsequent ligation into theHindIII-BamHI-digested vector generating pKtRNAAsn and pKtRNAGln. Positive clones were sequenced and used for tRNA overexpression in E. coli. A 30-ml culture of E. coli JM105 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) harboring one of the pKtRNA clones in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 75 μg/ml ampicillin was incubated at 37 °C overnight and then used as inoculum for a 750-ml culture. OnceA 600 of 0.5 was reached, tRNA expression was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the culture was supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. After an 8-h incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C and suspended in buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) to a final volume of 12.5 ml. Total nucleic acids were recovered by extraction with 12.5 ml of buffer-pH 4.6-saturated phenol. After a 20-min agitation at 23 °C and 10 min centrifugation at 4,000 × g, the aqueous phase was removed and saved. The phenol phase was re-extracted with 12.5 ml of buffer A. The pooled aqueous phases were extracted with an equal volume of phenol, and the aqueous layer was recovered. DNA was partially removed by precipitation with 20% (v/v) of 2-propanol. After centrifugation for 15 min at 4,500 × g, the supernatant was adjusted to 60% (v/v) of 2-propanol. The tRNA precipitate was harvested by centrifugation for 25 min at 4,500 ×g. After 1 wash the pellet was suspended in 5 ml of 200 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.5, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to deacylate the tRNA. The RNA was then chromatographed over DEAE-cellulose (0.01 ml DE52/A 260). The sample was loaded onto the column and washed with several volumes of 0.01m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.01m MgCl2. The tRNA was eluted with 1m NaCl, recovered by ethanol precipitation (10Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and then resuspended in 1.7 ml of water. The heterologous expression of theChlamydia tRNA genes was very good. For instance, expression of the tRNAAsn gene gave a “total E. colitRNA” sample that could be aspartylated to 145 pmols/A 260 compared with 25 pmols/A 260 of the E. coli tRNA before expression. Given that there are 15 pmols/A260 of E. coli tRNAAsn in the normal tRNA preparation, the tRNAAsn in the total E. coli tRNA sample is composed mainly of the Chlamydia species (∼90%). The fourChlamydia tRNA species relevant for this study (tRNAAsp, tRNAAsn, tRNAGlu, tRNAGln) were purified from the tRNA preparation after aminoacylation and biotinylation as previously described (17Pütz J. Wientges J. Sissler M. Giegé R. Florentz C. Schwienhorst A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1862-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation showed the individual tRNA preparations to be ∼95% pure. DNA sequences encoding the AspRS, GluRS, and GatCAB amidotransferase as identified in the genome analysis (16Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Science. 1998; 282: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar) were used to design primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the open reading frames (starting with ATG). After cloning the DNA fragments into pBAD expression vectors (with or without His6 sequence) and confirmation of their sequences, the plasmids were transformed into the E. coli BL21CodonPlus™ strain. The E. coli strain harboring a plasmid containing the gatCAB operon (with a N-terminal thioredoxin fusion for enhanced expression) was grown in a 5-liter culture. At a cell density of A 600 = 0.5, AdT expression was induced with 0.02% (v/v) l-arabinose. After growth for 12 h, the culture was centrifuged (5 min, 4,000 ×g, 4 °C) to harvest the cells (30 g), which were then suspended in 15 ml of buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm Na-EDTA, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 10% (v/v) glycerol). After cell disruption by sonication (15 × 20 s, 60 V) and removal of cell debris by low speed centrifugation, an S-100 fraction was prepared (centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C; all buffers contained 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm Na-EDTA, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The S-100 extract (30 ml) was applied to a ceramic hydroxyapatite type I column (5 ml) equilibrated and washed with 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.8. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (500 ml, 2.0 ml/min) of 10–50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8. Active fractions (253 ml) were pooled, dialyzed against a solution of 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, and applied to a ceramic hydroxyapatite type I column (5 ml) equilibrated with the same buffer solution. Basic and neutral proteins were removed by extensive washing (150 ml, 2 ml/min) with 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2. Additional proteins were eliminated by washing with a linear gradient (100 ml, 2 ml/min) of 0.001–1 m MgCl2 in 10 mm NaCl. The column was then equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (200 ml, 2 ml/min) from 10–250 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.8. Active fractions (110 ml) were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and loaded onto a HiTrap heparin (2 × 5 ml, in series) column equilibrated with the same buffer, and the protein was eluted with an isocratic flow (50 ml, 2 ml/min) of 100 mm KCl. Active fractions (15 ml) were dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, and applied to a HiTrap Q column (5 ml). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (100 ml, 2 ml/min) of 10–500 mm NaCl. Pure AdT fractions (20 ml) were dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, containing 50% (v/v) glycerol and stored at −20 °C. The purity of the enzyme was determined by SDS-PAGE and native-PAGE. AspRS and GluRS were partially purified. These enzymes were overexpressed in pBAD vector with or without an N-terminal His6 tag. The His-tagged enzymes were purified on a nickel nitrilotriacetate resin (Qiagen), whereas native enzymes were chromatographed on Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For amidotransferase assays, a total of 5 nmol of unfractionated tRNA from an E. coli stain that expresses the C. trachomatis tRNAGln or tRNAGlu was charged with [14C]glutamate (50 μm, 260 mCi/mmol) by 4 μg of partially purified native or His6-tagged GluRS. Charging curves were generated as described (10Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 12Curnow A.W. Tumbula D.L. Pelaschier J.T. Min B. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12838-12843Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) to check the activity with purified C. trachomatis tRNAGlu and tRNAGln expressed in E. coli. GluRS from D. radiodurans, B. subtilis (10Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and E. coli were also used. C. trachomatis tRNAAsn or tRNAAsp (4 nmol of unfractionated tRNA from an E. coli strain expressing the tRNA or the purified tRNAAsp and tRNAAsnspecies) was charged with [14C]aspartate (50 μm, 213 mCi/mmol) by 4 μg of partially purified native or His6-tagged C. trachomatis AspRS. AspRS fromE. coli, D. radiodurans (AspRS2), and C. acetobutylicum (AspRS2) was also used. The charging reaction was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in a 200-μl standard reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 10 mm ATP, 25 mm KCl, 15 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol. For kinetic analyses, time points were taken in the initial velocity range in triplicate, testing seven different concentrations of tRNA.K M for the two tRNA substrates was calculated by non-linear regression fitting of data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The AA-tRNA to be used as substrate to examine the amidotransferase reaction was extracted with acid-buffered phenol followed by a chloroform extraction and an ethanol precipitation. The [14C]AA-tRNA was dried completely and stored at −80 °C until needed. The activity assay was adapted from previous work (10Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 18Jahn D. Kim Y.C. Ishino Y. Chen M.W. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8059-8064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aminoacyl-tRNA was suspended in 20 μl (2×) amidation buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The AdT was characterized in the absence or presence of the following: 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NTP, 2 mm amide group donor, 0.2 mm sulfhydryl reducing reagent. An equal volume of AdT sample (0.1 nmol) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10–30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 0.6 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and followed by extraction with an equal volume of buffer-pH 5.2-saturated phenol followed by extraction with an equal volume of chloroform. The aqueous phase was removed, and AA-tRNA was ethanol-precipitated and pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 4 °C, 30 min). The dried pellet was suspended in 50 μl of 25 mm KOH and incubated at 65 °C for 15 min to deacylate the AA-tRNA. The mixture was neutralized by the addition of 1.3 μl of 100 mm HCl and then vacuum-dried. Samples were suspended in 6 μl of double-distilled water, and a 1-μl aliquot was spotted on a cellulose TLC plate. After chromatography in ammonia:water:chloroform:methanol (2:1:6:6), the plate was dried at 65 °C and then exposed to an activated phosphorimaging plate for 8–12 h. [14C]Amino acids were detected by scanning the image plate using a Fuji or Storm 860 Bioimager and analyzed with Fuji Image Gauge V3.3 software or Molecular Dynamics ImageQuaNT V4.0. Localization of [14C]amino acids was confirmed by ninhydrin assay using 50 nmol of unlabeled standards. A prerequisite of the transamidation route of Asn-tRNA and Gln-tRNA formation is the presence of non-discriminating AspRS and GluRS enzymes able to synthesize the mischarged tRNA substrates for the AdT. Therefore, we cloned (based on the genome sequence), expressed, and partially purified these enzymes, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both chlamydial synthetases have comparable activity when expressed as native protein or with the His6 tag (data not shown). Because of ease of purification, the His6-tagged proteins were used. TheC. trachomatis genome also contains a single tRNAAsn and a tRNAGln gene (19Lowe T.M. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (8185) Google Scholar). These genes were cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. The charging efficiency of the chlamydial synthetases using the C. trachomatis tRNAAsn and tRNAGlnpreparations were comparable with those obtained with the well characterized non-discriminating B. subtilis GluRS (5Lapointe J. Duplain L. Proulx M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 88-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) andD. radiodurans AspRS2 (8Pelaschier J. Two aspartyl-tRNA synthetases in Deinococcus radioduransPh.D. thesis. Yale University, 2000Google Scholar) enzymes. The purifiedChlamydia tRNA species (tRNAAsp, tRNAAsn, tRNAGlu, tRNAGln) could be charged well with Chlamydia, E. coli,Deinococcus, and Clostridium synthetases (see Figs. 2, A and B, and 3, A and B). In addition, formation of Chlamydia Asp-tRNAAsn was efficient when D. radiodurans AspRS2, C. acetobutylicum AspRS2, or Chlamydia AspRS were used (Fig. 2 C). Similarly, formation of Glu-tRNAGlnwas accomplished by B. subtilis and ChlamydiaGluRS (Fig. 3 C). Because Chlamydia AspRS does not resemble the archaeal non-discriminating AspRS proteins (see “Discussion”), we determined the K M for tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn (0.95 ± 0.4 μm and 2.76 ± 0.6 μm, respectively). These results show that the chlamydial GluRS and AspRS are non-discriminating aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and efficiently produce Glu-tRNAGln and Asp-tRNAAsn.Figure 3Aminoacylation of C. trachomatistRNAGlu and tRNAGln. The tRNAs and enzymes (amino acids) used are tRNAGln with E. coli GlnRS (Gln) (○) and C. trachomatis GluRS (Glu) (⋄) (A), tRNAGlu with D. radiodurans GluRS (Glu) (○) and C. trachomatis GluRS (Glu) (▵) (B), and tRNAGln with B. subtilis GluRS (Glu) (⋄) and C. trachomatis GluRS (Glu) (▵) (C). The background is the reaction without tRNA (■).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Orthologs of the three AdT-encoding genes (gatA, gatB, and gatC) were found in the C. trachomatis genome (16Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Science. 1998; 282: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these genes are adjacent and situated in an operon-like manner with the same arrangement as inB. subtilis (10Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The whole operon was cloned into anE. coli expression vector as a thioredoxin fusion of the gatC subunit and overexpressed, and the protein product was purified to homogeneity. The presence of heterologous ribosomal binding sites upstream of gatC, gatA, and gatB genes does not seem to restrict the overexpression of GatCAB, suggesting that a chlamydial promoter region can be recognized by E. coli. Our purification procedure consisted of three chromatographic media (hydroxyapatite, heparin-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose) and allowed purification of 8.4 mg of GatCAB from 30 g of cells with a yield of ∼10% (Table I). SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme corroborated the predicted molecular mass of the three open reading frames, GatC 25.3 kDa (11.1 kDa GatC plus a 14.2-kDa thioredoxin fusion protein), GatA, 55.0 kDa, and GatB 53.6 kDa (Fig.4 A). Native PAGE revealed only one band, confirming an intact heterotrimeric enzyme (Fig.4 B). The intensity of the stain suggested an approximately equal ratio of the three subunits (Fig. 4 A).Table IPurification of C. trachomatis Asp/Glu amidotransferasePurification stepTotal proteinTotal activity1-aOne unit is defined as 1 pmol of asparagine or glutamine produced per min at 37 °C using the assay conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.”Specific activityYieldRelative purificationAspAdTGluAdTAspAdGluAdTAspAdTGluAdTAspAdTGluAdTmgunits × 10 2units/mg%-foldS-1001-bDue to contamination of background amino acids and nucleic acids in the whole cell extract, we estimated the total activity and assumed a 1-fold purification.250027581.12.310010011Hydroxyapatite-1110020431.73.874741.51.7Hydroxyapatite-23809.1172.44.534292.22.0HiTrap heparin302.43.58.112967.45.2HiTrap Q8.42.94.0354811732211-a One unit is defined as 1 pmol of asparagine or glutamine produced per min at 37 °C using the assay conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-b Due to contamination of background amino acids and nucleic acids in the whole cell extract, we estimated the total activity and assumed a 1-fold purification. Open table in a new tab The purified recombinant AdT was assayed using ChlamydiaAsp-tRNAAsn and Glu-tRNAGln species (prepared with Chlamydia AspRS and GluRS) in the presence of ATP and the amide donor glutamine. Under our assay conditions about half of the two different substrates was converted into the desired products with equal efficiency (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 4), whereas an E. coli S-100 extract was incapable of carrying out the conversion of the mischarged AA-tRNAs (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 3). Additionally, removal (with enterokinase) of the thioredoxin part of the GatC fusion protein did not affect the Glu-AdT or Asp-AdT activities of the enzyme (data not shown). All these results demonstrated that Chlamydiapossesses a dual specificity Asp/Glu-AdT. Together with the fact that the organism also contains non-discriminating AspRS and GluRS enzymes, it is likely that the dual specificity amidotransferase serves in Asn-tRNA and Gln-tRNA formation in vivo. With the availability of pure Asp/Glu-AdT, we wanted to characterize the other substrates of the enzyme (Table II). Mg2+ is essential for the reaction. Amidotransferases use various amide donors (20Zalkin H. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 66: 203-309PubMed Google Scholar), predominantly glutamine, asparagine, and ammonium chloride. As can be seen in Table II, they are all active in Asn-tRNA and Gln-tRNA formation, with ammonium chloride being less effective. The usage is somewhat different from that of B. subtilis Glu-AdT (10Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar); however, this will be clarified when both enzymes are compared by detailed enzyme kinetics. On the other hand, the utilization of nucleoside triphosphates is significantly different by the two enzymes. Although the B. subtilis Glu-AdT can only use ATP (10Curnow A.W. Hong K. Yuan R. Kim S. Martins O. Winkler W. Henkin T.M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), the C. trachomatis Asp/Glu-AdT accepts GTP quite efficiently compared with ATP (Table II). In addition there appears to be an effect of the tRNA substrate on nucleoside triphosphate use; the Chlamydia enzyme Asp-AdT activity can also utilize CTP (Table II).Table IIRequirements of the amidation reactionEnzyme/Substrate combination2-aAll reactions include AdT and were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; DTNB, 5′5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid); PMB, p-hydroxymeriuribenzoate.[14C]Gln recoveredEnzyme/Substrate combination2-aAll reactions include AdT and were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” NEM,N-ethylmaleimide; DTNB, 5′5′-dithiobis-("
https://openalex.org/W2113276361,"We report here that a broad spectrum of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) antagonists produce a concentration-dependent, differential block in the endocytic recycling pathway of transferrin (Tf) and Tf receptors (TfRs) but have no acute affect on Tf uptake from the cell surface. At low concentrations of antagonists (∼1 μm), Tf and TfR accumulated in centrally located recycling endosomes, whereas at higher concentrations (∼10 μm), Tf-TfR accumulated in peripheral sorting endosomes. Several independent lines of evidence suggest that this inhibition of recycling may result from the inhibition of tubule formation. First, BFA-stimulated endosome tubule formation was similarly inhibited by PLA2 antagonists. Second, endocytosed tracers were found in larger spherical endosomes in the presence of PLA2 antagonists. And third, endosome tubule formation in a cell-free, cytosol-dependent reconstitution system was equally sensitive PLA2antagonists. These results are consistent with the conclusion that endosome membrane tubules are formed by the action of a cytoplasmic PLA2 and that PLA2-dependent tubules are involved in intracellular recycling of Tf and TfR. When taken together with previous studies on the Golgi complex, these results also indicate that an intracellular PLA2 activity provides a novel molecular mechanism for inducing tubule formation from multiple organelles. We report here that a broad spectrum of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) antagonists produce a concentration-dependent, differential block in the endocytic recycling pathway of transferrin (Tf) and Tf receptors (TfRs) but have no acute affect on Tf uptake from the cell surface. At low concentrations of antagonists (∼1 μm), Tf and TfR accumulated in centrally located recycling endosomes, whereas at higher concentrations (∼10 μm), Tf-TfR accumulated in peripheral sorting endosomes. Several independent lines of evidence suggest that this inhibition of recycling may result from the inhibition of tubule formation. First, BFA-stimulated endosome tubule formation was similarly inhibited by PLA2 antagonists. Second, endocytosed tracers were found in larger spherical endosomes in the presence of PLA2 antagonists. And third, endosome tubule formation in a cell-free, cytosol-dependent reconstitution system was equally sensitive PLA2antagonists. These results are consistent with the conclusion that endosome membrane tubules are formed by the action of a cytoplasmic PLA2 and that PLA2-dependent tubules are involved in intracellular recycling of Tf and TfR. When taken together with previous studies on the Golgi complex, these results also indicate that an intracellular PLA2 activity provides a novel molecular mechanism for inducing tubule formation from multiple organelles. transferrin transferrin receptor bovine brain cytosol bovine serum albumin 12-nm colloidal gold particles conjugated with BSA bromoenol lactone (or (E)-6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one) 2-(p-amylcinnamoyl)amino-4-cholorbenzoic acid phospholipase A2 fluorescein-labeled transferrin rhodamine-labeled transferrin trans-Golgi network brefeldin A modified Eagle's medium horseradish peroxidase adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate Endocytic compartments serve important sorting functions for the segregation and delivery of membrane-bound receptors, their cognate ligands, and soluble cargo to specific intracellular destinations (1Mellman I.

Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Early light and electron microscopic studies revealed that some membrane receptors become concentrated into endosomal tubules, 50–70 nm in diameter and extending from the main vesicular/vacuolar body of endosomes, before recycling back to the plasma membrane (3–16). These results suggested that tubules may serve to segregate membrane and receptors away from the bulk fluid volume of the vacuolar part of the endosome. From other studies, Maxfield and colleagues (2Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 17Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R.

These studies supported the idea that tubule formation provides a mechanism for the separation of membrane from soluble luminal contents based simply on differences in membrane surface-to-volume ratios (19Rome L.

Moreover, members of the ADP-ribosylation factor family of GTP-binding proteins appear to regulate endocytic trafficking, perhaps by mediating coat protein binding (29Zhang C.J. Rosenwald A.G.

Thus, in a manner analogous to trafficking in the secretory pathway, various types of ADP-ribosylation factor-regulated coated vesicles may also package receptors and membrane for recycling in the endocytic pathway. As with COPI and clathrin-coated vesicles of the Golgi complex andtrans-Golgi network (TGN), respectively, binding of coat proteins to endosomal membranes is sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA) (15Futter C.E.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). As a result of BFA's action, some endosomes are stimulated to form extensive membrane tubules, as do Golgi and TGN membranes (36Hunziker W. Whitney J.A. Mellman I.

Brown W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, unlike its effects on the secretory pathway, BFA does not significantly inhibit endocytic uptake or trafficking through endocytic compartments (37Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 41Wood S.A. Brown W.J. J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24829-24833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our understanding of the exact roles that tubules and vesicles play in endocytic recycling is incomplete because, as yet, no trafficking intermediates have been definitively characterized. One possibility is that endosome tubules provide a mechanism for bulk segregation of membrane (including receptors) from fluid content, whereas coated vesicles provide additional specificity for receptor packaging and membrane fission (1Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar, 2Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Tubules and vesicles could work in concert with coated vesicles budding from the tips of tubules, or they could work independently (3Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Strous G.J.A.M. Lodish H. Schwartz A.L. Cell. 1983; 32: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 15Futter C.E. Gibson A. Allchin E.H. Maxwell S. Ruddock L.J. Odorizzi G. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J.

Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).The mechanisms of endosome tubule formation are not known; however, they are probably different from that of coated vesicle formation because tubulation is enhanced in the presence of BFA, i.e.when coat proteins are prevented from binding. By way of comparison, recent studies on Golgi membranes have strongly suggested that tubulation, both in vivo and in a cell-free reconstitution system, requires the action of a cytosolic Ca2+-independent PLA2 activity (43de Figueiredo P. Drecktrah D. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Strang M. Brown W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8642-8647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 44de Figueiredo P. Polizotto R.S. Drecktrah D.

Biochem. 1999; 74: 670-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that constitutive and BFA-stimulated retrograde trafficking from the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum was strongly inhibited by a variety of compounds that antagonize cytoplasmic Ca2+-independent PLA2 enzymes (43de Figueiredo P. Drecktrah D. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Strang M. Brown W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8642-8647Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 46de Figueiredo P. Drecktrah D. Polizotto R.S. Cole N.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Brown W.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In vitro studies suggest that the PLA2 acts directly on the membranes to induce tubule formation (44de Figueiredo P. Polizotto R.S. Drecktrah D. Brown W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1763-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 45Polizotto R.S. de Figueiredo P. Brown W.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 670-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that endosomes and Golgi membranes utilize the same mechanisms to induce tubules, which are involved in different membrane trafficking events. Here we provide evidence that tubulation of endosome membranes, both in vivo and in anin vitro cell-free reconstitution system, was potently inhibited by a variety of PLA2 antagonists, which also significantly inhibited recycling of Tf-TfR complexes from various endosomal compartments in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and CellsStock solutions of the following reagents were prepared and stored at −20 °C: BFA (10 mg/ml in ethanol),N-ethylmaleimide (0.1 m), nocodazole (6 mg/ml in Me2SO), and AMP-PNP (0.1 m) were obtained from Sigma; GTPγS (50 mm) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Nu-Serum was from Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA), and Calf Serum-Supplemented was from Life Technologies, Inc.125I-Tf was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phospholipase and other inhibitors were obtained from the following sources:N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid, 2-(p-amylcinnamoyl)amino-4-cholorbenzoic acid (ONO-RS-082), and (E)-6-(bromomethylene) tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (or bromoenol lactone (BEL)) were from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA); quinacrine, p-bromophenacyl bromide, and all other common reagents were from Sigma. The following antibodies were generously supplied: monoclonal anti-TfR antibodies (HTR-H68) by Dr. Ian Trowbridge (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) and polyclonal antibodies against β1,4 galactosyltransferase by Dr. Eric Berger (University of Zurich, Switzerland). Fluorescein-Tf (FITC-Tf) and rhodamine-Tf (Rhod-Tf) were prepared exactly as described (47de Figueiredo P. Brown W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 871-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Rat clone 9 hepatocytes and HeLa cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) with 10% Nu-Serum or Calf Serum-Supplemented and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2.Binding, Endocytosis, and Trafficking of 125I-Tf, Fluorescent Tf, and Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)HeLa cells were grown for 2 days to ∼70–80% confluence in 12-well plates for 125I-Tf binding, uptake, and recycling experiments or on glass coverslips for fluorescent Tf uptake and recycling experiments. For all binding, uptake, and recycling experiments, cells were first rinsed three times in MEM (without serum) and incubated in the same for 30 min at 37 °C. Also, unless otherwise indicated, MEM did not contain serum, which inhibits the effects of PLA2 inhibitors. The subsequent procedures for assaying binding, uptake, and recycling described below were modified from previous studies (48McGraw T.E. Subtil A. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 15.13.11-15.13.23Google Scholar).Biochemical Determination of 125Tf TraffickingTo measure the effects of PLA2 inhibitors on the relative amounts of TfRs found on the cell surface, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μm BEL in MEM for 45 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Plates were then transferred to a cold room and placed on ice, and cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold MEM containing a 1:10 dilution of the normal sodium bicarbonate (MEM1/10). All subsequent surface binding procedures were done at 4 °C. Cells were briefly rinsed with an acid wash (500 mm NaCl, 0.2 n acetic acid, pH 2) to remove any surface-bound Tf and then rinsed three times with MEM1/10, which restored the pH to 7.4. Medium was removed and then replaced with 0.5 ml of MEM1/10 containing a saturating amount of 125I-Tf (467 ng of Tf/well = 0.208 μCi/well). Cells were incubated for 2 h with gentle shaking. The medium was removed, and cells were washed six times with MEM1/10 (by which time the last wash had only background levels of 125I). Cells were extracted by the addition of 1 n NaOH and gentle shaking for 30 min. The extract was collected and counted in a γ counter.To measure the effects of PLA2 inhibitors on the endocytic uptake of Tf from the cell surface, 12-well plates were placed on ice, rinsed with ice-cold acid wash and then washed three times with ice-cold MEM. The medium was removed, and cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μm BEL in ice-cold MEM for 10 min on ice. The medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of MEM plus 10 μm BEL (37 °C), as appropriate, which also contained125I-Tf (amounts described above for surface binding). Cells were allowed to internalize the bound 125I-Tf for 10 min at 37 °C. Following removal of the medium, cells were rinsed with ice-cold acid wash, washed six times with ice-cold MEM, and then extracted with 1 n NaOH as above.To measure the effect of PLA2 inhibitors on the recycling of Tf from internal compartments back to the cell surface, cells were incubated with MEM containing 125I-Tf (0.17 μCi/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The medium was removed, and cells were washed six times in ice-cold MEM (while on ice) and then incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μmBEL in MEM for 5 min at 4 °C. The medium was removed; 0.5 ml of 37 °C efflux medium (MEM containing 0.1 mmdesferrioxamine, 3 μg/ml Tf) with or without 10 μm BEL as appropriate was added; and cells were further incubated for various periods of time at 37 °C. At the end of each time period, medium was collected, and intracellular 125I-Tf was harvested by extracting cells in 1 n NaOH. The amounts of125I-Tf in both the medium and intracellular samples were determined.Morphological Analysis of Fluorescent Tf TraffickingTo visualize the endocytosis and trafficking of fluorescent Tf, cells were treated essentially as above for biochemical labeling experiments. In some cases, various specific pulse-chase protocols were conducted, which will be described below. Cells were incubated in FITC-Tf (20 μg/ml) and/or Rhod-Tf (30 μg/ml) to label various endocytic compartments. In many cases after labeling with fluorescent Tf, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence to localize TfR as described (47de Figueiredo P. Brown W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 871-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or the trans-Golgi/TGN membrane protein, galactosyltransferase (using polyclonal antibodies at a 1:600 dilution). In most cases, fluorescently labeled cells were viewed with standard epifluorescence optics; however, in a few specific instances, where noted, cells were viewed by scanning confocal microscopy with a Bio-Rad 600 confocal microscope.Endocytosis of soluble HRP and its visualization by diaminobenzidine cytochemistry for electron microscopy were performed as previously described (47de Figueiredo P. Brown W.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 871-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Preparation of EndosomesA suspension of 12-nm colloidal gold particles (Au12) was prepared as described (49Handley D.A. Hayat M.A. Colloidal Gold: Principles, Methods, and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1989: 13-32Crossref Google Scholar), stabilized with bovine serum albumin (BSA), resuspended in MEM (for clone 9 cells) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (for RAW 264.7 cells), and stored at 4 °C until used. Monolayers of clone 9 hepatocytes or RAW 264.7 macrophages were grown to confluence in 4–7 220-mm2plastic tissue culture plates. To label endosomes with Au12-BSA, cells were briefly rinsed once with MEM at 37 °C and incubated with prewarmed Au12-BSA suspension (in MEM; 75 ml/dish) for 15 min (clone 9) or 10 min (RAW 264.7) at 37 °C. Labeling was terminated by rapidly pouring off the Au12-BSA suspension and washing cells three times with ice-cold MEM; plates were kept on ice as the cells were harvested with a rubber policeman. All subsequent steps in the preparation procedure were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were harvested in a table top centrifuge (IEC) for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet of packed cells was thoroughly resuspended in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and centrifuged as above. This step was repeated once, and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer to yield a 20% (v/v) cell suspension and homogenized by passage (2–4 times) through a Balch/Rothman ball bearing homogenizer (50Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The homogenate (∼8 ml) was centrifuged as above to yield a postnuclear supernatant. This centrifugation step was repeated if the postnuclear supernatant contained any nuclei as detected by phase-contrast microscopy. The postnuclear supernatant (4 ml) was layered on top of a sucrose step gradient in Beckman SW28.1 centrifuge tubes containing the following concentrations of sucrose at each step (3.4 ml/step): 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2 m sucrose. Each sucrose solution was buffered with 1 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Additionally, the 0.5 m sucrose step contained 500 mm KCl, which served to wash endosomes as they moved through the gradient and lowered the background level of in vitro tubulation. The gradients were centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 2 h in a Beckman SW28.1 rotor. Material at the 1.0/1.5 m sucrose interface contained the highest concentration of Au12-BSA-loaded endosomes, was collected with a Pasteur pipette, and was either used immediately or slowly frozen and stored at −80 °C. Tubulation-competent endosomes had a useful shelf life of ∼2 days at −80 °C.Preparation of Bovine Brain CytosolBovine brain cytosol used in these in vitro studies was prepared as previously described (51Banta M. Polizotto R.S. Wood S.A. de Figueiredo P. Brown W.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13359-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two fractions of brain cytosol from this preparation were used in these studies. The first, called “crude cytosol” was the supernatant obtained immediately after centrifuging the brain homogenate at 95,500 × gfor 2 h. The second fraction, called “bovine brain cytosol” or BBC, was prepared from the above supernatant by precipitation with 60% ammonium sulfate, reconstitution in buffer, and dialysis as described (51Banta M. Polizotto R.S. Wood S.A. de Figueiredo P. Brown W.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13359-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments used this BBC preparation. Typically, 1.5 kg of brains yielded over 600 ml of cytosol with a protein concentration of ∼25 mg/ml.In Vitro Tubulation AssayThe tubulation of isolated endosomes was visualized by a whole mount EM-negative stain assay as used to document the tubulation of Golgi membranes (52Cluett E.B. Wood S.A. Banta M. Brown W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In a typical assay, 12.5 μl of bovine brain cytosol was mixed with 87.5 μl of tubulation buffer (final concentrations in the complete assay mixture: 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing various combinations of other reagents such as ATP and/or GTP. This buffer mixture and either fresh or thawed endosome-enriched fractions were equilibrated to 37 °C for 15 min. Tubulation was initiated by slowly adding an equal volume (20 μl) of the cytosol/buffer mixture to the endosome-enriched fractions, followed by incubation at 37 °C for various periods of time. Drops of the endosome suspension were placed on Formvar- and carbon-coated EM grids for 15 min at room temperature, and grids were negatively stained with 2.0% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.2, and viewed by electron microscopy (52Cluett E.B. Wood S.A. Banta M. Brown W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In an alternate method, drops of the endosome suspension were placed on Formvar- and carbon-coated EM grids for 5 min at room temperature, and glutaraldehyde (from 25% stock solution) was added directly to the drops (to a final concentration of 0.1%) and allowed to fix the organelles for 5 min. The fixed organelles were then stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid as described above.Endosome tubulation was quantified by determining the percentage of gold-loaded organelles that displayed at least one membranous tubule or that were completely tubular. For each experimental condition, at least 150 endosomes were counted from triplicate samples. A tubule was defined as a membranous extension, 50–70 nm in diameter and at least twice as long, that was continuous with the lipid bilayer of the endosome. For practical reasons, however, this assay can only provide a semiquantitative estimation of the tubulation activity. Ideally, we would like to determine the number of tubules/endosome. Unfortunately, determining this number slowed analyses of the experiments to unacceptable levels. Therefore, an endosome with one tubule was equal to an endosome with multiple tubules. From our qualitative observations, however, we noticed a clear positive correlation between the number of endosomes with tubules and the number of tubules/endosome.DISCUSSIONThis paper provides evidence for the role of a cytoplasmic Ca2+-independent PLA2 in the recycling of Tf-TfR from endosomal compartments to the cell surface and the formation of endosome tubules both in vivo and in vitro. These results are similar to those of recent studies that demonstrated a nearly identical sensitivity of Golgi membrane tubulation and retrograde trafficking to PLA2 antagonists (43de Figueiredo P.

The fact that a broad spectrum of PLA2antagonists were found to inhibit trafficking events, suspected or known to involve membrane tubules, from both endosomes and the Golgi complex, suggests that a cytoplasmic PLA2 activity plays a general role in tubule formation from organellar membranes.We found that higher concentrations of PLA2 antagonists (∼10 μm) inhibited trafficking from peripheral sorting endosomes to central recycling endosomes, and lower concentrations (1 μm) inhibited trafficking from central recycling endosomes to the cell surface. At either concentration, it appeared that transport out of an endocytic compartment rather than fusion with a target was the inhibited step. Although not shown directly, several lines of evidence support this idea. First, uptake and trafficking of endocytic tracers in the presence of low or high concentrations of BEL did not appear to result in the accumulation of small transport vesicles or tubules. Second, at the concentrations of inhibitors used here or in previous studies on trafficking through the Golgi complex, no acute effect on any known coated vesicle-mediated transport step was found, including endocytosis from the cell surface and anterograde trafficking through the secretory pathway (43de Figueiredo P.

Third, BFA-stimulated tubulation of Tf-TfR-enriched endosomes was also potently inhibited within the same concentration range for all PLA2antagonists examined. And, fourth, cytosol-dependent endosome tubulation in the cell-free system was also potently inhibited by the same PLA2 antagonists.The conclusion that PLA2 antagonists inhibit the tubule-mediated exit of Tf-TfRs from both early sorting and late recycling endosomes is also consistent with our current understanding of the Tf-TfR recycling pathway (1Mellman I.

This motif was randomized with three different sets of mostly hydrophobic residues in the context of POSSYCCAT, a modified ToxR transcription activator system. The resulting combinatorial libraries were subjected to different levels of selective pressure to obtain groups of transmembrane segments that are distinguished by their ability to self-interact in bacterial membranes. Upon relating self-interaction to amino acid composition, the following conclusions were made. First, randomization with only Leu, Ile, Val, Met, and Phe resulted in unexpected robust self-interaction with little sequence specificity. Second, with more complex amino acid mixtures that represent natural transmembrane segments more closely, self-interaction critically depended on amino acid composition of the interface. Whereas the contents of Ile and Leu residues increased with the ability to self-interact, the contents of Pro and Arg residues decreased. Third, heptad repeat motifs composed of Leu, Ile, Val, Met, and Phe were ∼40-fold over-represented in transmembrane segments of single-span membrane proteins as compared with motifs composed of the more complex amino acid mixtures. This suggests that heptad motifs composed of the smaller subset of amino acids were enriched in the course of natural single-span membrane protein evolution.

In addition, hydrogen bonding between membrane-embedded polar residues has been shown to drive interaction of model transmembrane segments (5Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M.

Depending on the geometry of amino acid packing, pairs of transmembrane segment helices favor either positive or negative crossing angles (8Langosch D. Heringa J. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Previously, we demonstrated that the interfaces of those pairs of transmembrane segments adopting positive crossing angles within bacteriorhodopsin, the photosynthetic reaction center, and cytochrome-coxidase are described by a repeated heptad (a..de.g) pattern of amino acids that is characteristic of soluble leucine zipper interaction domains (8Langosch D.

Apart from these multispan proteins, membrane-spanning leucine zipper domains were also found to drive assembly of certain single-span membrane proteins (10Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. MacKenzie K.R.

Furthermore, a ga..de.ga..de.ga heptad repeat motif of Leu residues drives self-assembly of artificial transmembrane segments in natural membranes and in detergent solution (13Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Interestingly, variants of this Leu-rich heptad motif were found within the transmembrane segments of a diverse set of single-span natural membrane proteins where they appear to be important for oligomeric assembly and function (13Gurezka R.

To this end, we randomized the ga..de.ga..de.ga motif with three different sets of mostly hydrophobic residues and expressed the resulting sequences in the context of POSSYCCAT1(Positive Selection System based onChromosomally integrated CAT), which is a modified version of the ToxR system previously used to study interactions between transmembrane segments (16Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 17Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). ToxR chimeric proteins harboring the random transmembrane segment were then isolated with or without selective pressure. Subsequently, the relationship between self-assembly and amino acid composition of the interfacial positions was established. The ToxR/MalE coding region from vector pToxRΔTM (13Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was amplified using a sense primer with an XbaI site, the ribosome binding site from pASK111 (18Skerra A. Gene. 1994; 151: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and an antisense primer, including a sequence encoding the myc antibody tag and anXhoI site. The resulting PCR fragment was inserted into pASK111 cut with XbaI/XhoI. Upon digesting this vector with XbaI/AseI, the fragment harboring the ToxR/MalE coding region, the F1 origin, and the chloramphenicol resistance gene was isolated. This fragment was ligated to a PCR fragment of vector pBAD (Invitrogen) harboring the araBADpromoter, the araC gene, and the ColE1 origin as well as terminal XbaI and AseI sites. In the resulting vector the BamHI site of the araBAD promoter was eliminated by point mutagenesis. Upon digesting this vector withPstI/AseI, the fragment harboring thearaBAD promoter, the ToxR/MalE coding region, and thearaC gene was isolated. This fragment was ligated to a PCR fragment harboring the kanamycin resistance gene and the F1 origin, which was amplified from vector pET24d (Novagen) using a sense primer with the T2 transcription terminator from the cat2 gene fromStaphylococcus aureus plus an NdeI site and an antisense primer with a PstI site. This resulted in vector pToxRIVΔTM. Derivatives of pToxRIV encoding AZ2, L1/6/8/13/15A, or L2/5/9/12/16A transmembrane segments were made by ligating synthetic oligonucleotide cassettes encoding the desired sequences into pToxRIV previously cut with NheI and BamHI. The ctx promoter region of plasmid pLDR10-ctxΔsiglacZ (kindly supplied by H.-J. Fritz, Göttingen) was amplified using a sense primer with anXbaI site and an antisense primer where 34 nucleotides at the 3′-end were homologous to the 5′-end of the cat gene. The cat gene of plasmid pLDR10-ctxΔsiglacZ was amplified using the foregoing PCR fragment as the sense primer and an antisense primer, including the T2 terminator and a BamHI site. The resulting PCR fragment was ligated to a restriction fragment, which resulted from digesting pLDR10 (19Diederich L. Rasmussen L.J. Messer W. Plasmid. 1992; 28: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) withXbaI/BamHI and harbors the attP phage lambda attachment site, a ColE1-like origin, and catand bla genes. The resulting vector is termed pLDR10ctx::cat. The ctx::cat hybrid gene contained in vector pLDR10ctx::cat was integrated into the attB phage lambda attachment site ofEscherichia coli DH5α as described previously (19Diederich L. Rasmussen L.J. Messer W. Plasmid. 1992; 28: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The resulting strain is termed Chr3. Combinatorial libraries were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Bio-Rad MutaGene II kit) using a single-stranded template derived from vector pToxRIVΔTM and the following antisense primers: 5′-ATT GGC TTG GGT TGA TCA GAA TCC CSA NSA NTG CSA NSA NAG CTG CSA NSA NTG CSA NSA NAG CTG CSA NSA NGC TAG CTC GAT TCC CCA AGT (library III), 5′-ATT GGC TTG GGT TGA TCA GAA TCC CAV BAV BTG CAV BAV BAG CTG CAV BAV BTG CAV BAV BAG CTG CAV BAV BGC TAG CTC GAT TCC CCA AGT (library IV), and 5′-ATT GGC TTG GGT TGA TCA GAA TCC CRV HRV HTG CRV HRV HAG CTG CRV HRV HTG CRV HRV HAG CTG CRV HRV HGC TAG CTC GAT TCC CCA AGT (library V). B, H, N, R, S, and V refer to equimolar mixtures of G/T/C, A/C/T, G/A/T/C, A/G, G/C, and G/C/A, respectively. Crude libraries were obtained by transforming the mutagenesis reactions into XL1-blue cells (Stratagene). PD28 libraries were obtained by digesting plasmid preparations (2 μg) isolated from the crude libraries with 24 units of BamHI for 2 h and subsequently with 400 units of exonuclease III for 3 h at 37 °C. This procedure removed un-mutagenized parental pToxRIVΔTM plasmids. To select for ToxR chimeric proteins integrated into the inner membrane, the plasmids were transformed into PD28 cells and grown for 16 h at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium containing 0.4% maltose and 33 μg/ml kanamycin as described previously (17Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Plasmid preparations isolated from crude or from PD28 libraries were transformed into Chr3 cells and grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin plus 33 μg/ml kanamycin. The overnight culture was inoculated at a dilution of 1:100 into LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 33 μg/ml kanamycin, 2% (w/v) glucose, and 1% (w/v) l-arabinose. AtA 600 = 0.6 the cultures were diluted 50- to 500-fold and plated onto LB agar plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 33 μg/ml kanamycin, 2% (w/v) glucose, 1% (w/v)l-arabinose plus 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, or 180 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Upon incubation for 16–24 h at 37 °C, colonies were picked and plasmids were isolated and sequenced. Based on the sequences obtained from crude libraries without chloramphenicol selection, we found that their amino acid compositions closely matched the theoretical compositions defined by codon usage and given in Fig.3 A (data not shown). Plasmid-transformed FHK12 cells were grown for 24 h at 37 °C under shaking in the presence of 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 33 μg/ml kanamycin, and 0.2% (w/v) l-arabinose unless indicated otherwise. β-Galactosidase activity of cell-free extracts was determined as described previously (16Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and is given in Miller units (MU). Western blotting was done as described with an antiserum recognizing the MalE moiety of the constructs (16Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The predicted transmembrane segments of single-span or multispan membrane proteins contained in Swiss-Prot version 39+ (total of 94,151 entries) were searched with theXX..XX.XX..XX.XXheptad repeat motif where X corresponds to any amino acid used for transmembrane segment randomization of libraries III, IV, or V; dots correspond to any amino acid except the charged residues lysine, arginine, glutamate, and aspartate. For single-span membrane proteins, a subset of 4348 proteins that contain single predicted transmembrane segments was searched. For multispan membrane proteins, a subset of 58,849 transmembrane segments contained within 8425 proteins was searched. Because prediction of the exact transmembrane segment termini is uncertain and dependent on the prediction method, we included 5 residues at either terminus in the searches. Very similar results were obtained, however, when the searches were restricted to the predicted membrane-spanning sequences. All searches were conducted using the Findpatterns option of the HUSAR sequence analysis package made available by the German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg. Chimeric ToxR proteins consist of the cytoplasmic ToxR domain, a transmembrane segment of choice, and a periplasmic maltose binding protein (MalE) domain (20Kolmar H. Hennecke F. Götze K. Janzer B. Vogt B. Mayer F. Fritz H.-J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3895-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Anchored within the inner membrane of expressing E. coli cells, these ToxR chimera are thought to exist in monomer/dimer equilibria depending on the mutual affinity of the respective transmembrane segments (16Langosch D.L. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.-J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 17Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The ToxR domain of the self-assembled form activates the cholera toxin (ctx) promoter thus driving expression of a downstream lacZreporter gene in FHK12 reporter cells. β-Galactosidase activity is therefore diagnostic of ToxR assembly in the membrane. Because self-assembly of transmembrane segments is expected to exhibit concentration dependence like any reversible protein-protein interaction, we constructed the pToxRIV vector allowing for regulated expression. To this end, we replaced the endogenous ToxR promoter (21Kolmar H. Fritsch C. Kleeman G. Götze K. Stevens F.J. Fritz H.J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) by the araBAD promoter, which is induced by arabinose and repressed by glucose (22Niland P. Hühne R. Müller-Hill B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In an initial experiment, we compared β-galactosidase activities elicited by different constructs, which differ in their abilities to self-interact. Accordingly, we compared the AZ2 motif, which is a previously established self-interacting heptad repeat motif of Leu residues (13Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), two mutants where Leu ata and d or at e and gpositions was replaced by Ala (L1/6/8/13/15A, L2/5/9/12/16A), and a ToxR protein lacking the transmembrane segment (ΔTM) (Fig.1). As expected, increasing arabinose concentrations strongly increased total β-galactosidase activities while the relative differences in signal strength elicited by the different constructs decreased. That is, experimental discrimination between transmembrane segments of different mutual affinity is optimized by precisely tuning the levels of ToxR protein expression. In vitro selection of rare self-interacting transmembrane segments requires exposure of combinatorial libraries to selective pressure where only cells expressing transcriptionally active ToxR proteins survive. To construct a system allowing for positive selection, we placed the gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) under transcriptional control of the ctx promoter. A single copy of thectx::cat hybrid sequence was stably integrated into the lambda attB site of the E. coli chromosome thus yielding the Chr3 reporter strain (Fig.2). Because self-assembling ToxR proteins confer chloramphenicol resistance to Chr3 cells, this system is termed POSSYCCAT. Transmembrane segments of different mutual affinity can be readily distinguished from each other using POSSYCCAT. By monitoring colony size as an indicator of growth inhibition by 90 or 120 μg/ml chloramphenicol, we found that the presence of 1% (w/v) arabinose plus 2% (w/v) glucose clearly differentiated between AZ2 and the mutants described above. Upon plating at 180 μg/ml CM, only AZ2-expressing cells survived. Thus, these conditions are suited to select for self-interacting transmembrane segments. Pursuing a somewhat different strategy, Russ and Engelman (23Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) have previously constructed the TOXCAT system where the ctx::cat sequence is on a multicopy plasmid. By monitoring colony size, we found that cells harboring a plasmid-borne ctx::catsequence could not reproducibly distinguish between the degree of chloramphenicol resistance conferred by the AZ2 motif, its mutants, and ToxRΔTM. Thus, the presence of only one copy of the catreporter gene, as in POSSYCCAT, significantly increased the power of the selection system to discriminate between interactions of different affinity. Thea, d, e, and g positions of the ga..de.ga..de.ga motif constituting the interface of pairs of transmembrane segments with positive crossing angles (8Langosch D. Heringa J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 31: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) were randomized. Three different sets of almost exclusively hydrophobic amino acids encoded by degenerate codons were chosen (Fig.3 A). These residues correspond to five (library III) or seven (libraries IV and V) of the nine most abundant amino acids in transmembrane segments (24Arkin I.T. Brünger A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1429: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Ala was chosen for the non-interfacial b, c, and fpositions, because an oligo-Ala sequence does not self-interact (13Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The corresponding nucleotide sequences were inserted into the pToxRIVΔTM vector by insertion mutagenesis. To assess the average capability of the random transmembrane segment sequences in these libraries to self-interact, we determined β-galactosidase activities of FHK12 cell populations expressing the whole libraries. Library III elicited the highest average β-galactosidase activity followed by libraries V and IV. With libraries III and V, β-galactosidase activity increased substantially upon prior selective digestion (see “Experimental Procedures”) of parental pToxRIVΔTM plasmids remaining in these “crude” libraries (Fig. 3 B). Upon elimination of ΔTM plasmids, each library contained ∼104 unique clones. This effect of pre-digestion was compared with the consequences of eliminating ToxR proteins being incapable of membrane integration. The rationale behind this experiment was to obtain a rough measure of the content of non-integrating transmembrane segments in our libraries. To this end, the crude libraries were transformed into and re-isolated from PD28 cells. PD28 is an MalE deletion strain that can survive on minimal media with maltose as the only carbon source only upon expression of membrane-integrated ToxR proteins that present their MalE moiety toward the periplasm (17Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 26Bedouelle H. Duplay P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To test the validity of this approach, PD28 cells transformed with membrane-integrating AZ2 or cytoplasmic ΔTM plasmids (13Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) were grown on rich media and mixed at a ratio of 1:9. Subsequently, this mixture of cells was cultured on maltose-containing minimal medium and plasmids were re-isolated. Restriction digestion showed that 9 out of 10 clones surviving passage through PD28 cells corresponded to AZ2. This indicated that about 99% of non-integrating ΔTM proteins were eliminated by this procedure. Prior passage of library III through PD28 cells increased average β-galactosidase activity similar to pre-digestion of pToxRIVΔTM plasmids. With library V, passage through PD28 cells had a somewhat stronger effect than pre-digestion (Fig. 3 B). With library IV, neither treatment had a strong effect. Accordingly, it appears that the vast majority of our random transmembrane segment sequences, especially those encoded by libraries III and IV, are capable of membrane insertion; only the crude version of library V contained a significant fraction of non-integrating ToxR proteins. In the next step, we tested the ability of the different libraries to confer chloramphenicol resistance to Chr3 cells. Pre-digested libraries were passed through PD28 cells, transformed into Chr3 cells, and plated onto agar plates containing from 0 to 180 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Upon overnight growth, the numbers of surviving colonies were counted. In line with the different average β-galactosidase activities, the libraries displayed different abilities to survive increasing selective pressure. With library III, the number of surviving clones decreased only moderately with increasing chloramphenicol concentration. A similarly modest decrease was observed for cells transformed with pToxRIVAZ2 and is therefore not reflecting successive elimination of non-interacting sequences. In contrast to that, the colony numbers of libraries IV and V decreased much more strongly and as a continuous function of increasing chloramphenicol concentration (Fig.3 C). At 180 μg/ml chloramphenicol, the number of surviving colonies of libraries III, V, and IV was reduced to about 42, 17, and 0.11%, respectively, of the numbers that were originally plated. This suggests a broader distribution of affinities in libraries IV and V than in library III. Taken together, randomizing with only Leu, Ile, Val, Met, and Phe appeared to produce mainly well interacting sequences. However, increasing the complexity of the amino acid complement used for randomization strongly decreased the fractions of self-interacting transmembrane segments. This is reflected by decreased average β-galactosidase activities as well as by decreased fractions of colonies surviving chloramphenicol selection. To obtain transmembrane segments with different mutual affinities, we isolated ToxR proteins from Chr3 cells cultured with or without selective pressure. In the first step, we isolated ToxR plasmids without selective pressure, yet passed through PD28 cells to exclusively obtain proteins capable of membrane insertion. Individual plasmids were then re-transformed into FHK12 cells to determine the β-galactosidase activities elicited by the encoded ToxR proteins.

Surprisingly, ToxR proteins derived from library III under these unselective conditions almost exclusively elicited β-galactosidase activities similar to (800–1500 MU) or above (1500–2000 MU) that of the AZ2 construct, which corresponds to 1128 ± 242 MU (see Fig.1).

Grüber G. Matthews B.W. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13697-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) shows that it is consistent with the 2.1-Å resolution crystal structure of the isolated γε complex (9Rodgers A.J.W. Wilce M.C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the structure of the latter complex satisfactorily accounts for the observed electron density. Rod-like electron density features seen in the map were previously interpreted as α-helical regions in the γ-subunit. Some of these are confirmed, but others are not. In particular, the extension of the long coiled-coil α-helices that constitute the “axle” of the F1 particle is seen in the structure of isolated γ′ε as is the helix that includes residues 88–103. On the other hand, other density features putatively identified as α-helices are now seen to correspond to regions of β-sheet.Do the Structures of E. coli and Bovine F1 Represent Distinct Functional States?As shown in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 and in Table I, when the α3β3 hexamers of E. coli and DCCD-inhibited bovine F1 are superimposed, the “stalk” subunits (γ and ε in E. coli) differ substantially. Relative to the bovine enzyme, the two long, coiled-coil α-helices of γ that form the axle of the F1 particle unwind and rotate substantially (Fig. 5) rotating the β-sandwich domain of the ε-subunit around the central axis by 81° compared with its counterpart in the bovine enzyme (Fig. 6 C). There is also a radial displacement and significant reorientation of the ε-subunit.The nucleotide content of the DCCD-treated enzyme has been reported (8Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Mg-ADP is bound in two β-subunits, whereas the catalytic site in the third is empty. Unfortunately, the level of resolution obtained so far for the crystals of E. coli F1do not allow identification of nucleotide occupancy. The enzyme was crystallized in the presence of Mg-AMP-PNP and MgATP, along with azide and it is likely that some catalytic sites contain AMP-PNP or other ligands resulting from the expected hydrolysis of AMP-PNP and ATP during crystallization. Likewise, the nucleotide content of catalytic sites in the yeast F1F0 structure remains undefined, although crystallization conditions were more similar to those of the ECF1 than the DCCD-MF1 structure. Without the detailed understanding of catalytic site occupancy in the three crystal forms, it is not possible to relate the movements of γ and ε with individual steps in catalysis. However, we believe that the different states are physiologically relevant structures because such movements of the γ- and ε-subunits have been seen before within the E. coli F1 and shown to be nucleotide-dependent. For example, Wilkens and Capaldi (23Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1994; 375: 43-51Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) used cryoelectron microscopy to examine the position of the ε-subunit within the α3β3 hexagon. The ε-subunit was specifically labeled with a small (14 Å) gold particle at residue 38. A corresponding electron-dense feature was found close to a β-subunit with uncleaved ATP trapped in the enzyme (by rapid freezing) but moved along with the γ-subunit counterclockwise to the adjacent α-subunit when ATP was allowed to turn over before freezing (Fig. 6, A and B). This represents a movement of the ε-subunit of ∼20 Å. As shown in Fig. 6, the 81° rotation of ε suggested by the respective crystal structures is somewhat greater than that suggested in the electron micrographs. The overall 20-Å movement of ε shown by the electron microscopy is, however, remarkably close to the 23-Å difference in the positioning of ε in the two crystal structures, emphasizing the essential concordance of the two very different structural approaches.Also, a nucleotide-dependent shift in the position of Glu108 in the ε-subunit has been observed in cross-linking experiments (24Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26645-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, a cysteine at this site can be cross-linked to an α-subunit, whereas in ADP + Mg2+ + Pi, the cysteine can be covalently linked to residue 381 at the bottom of a β-subunit. Finally, Yasuda and co-workers (26Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar, 27Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) have recently followed the rotation of the γ-subunit in the α3β3 subcomplex ofBacillus PS3 F1. They were able to dissect the 120° rotation that occurs with each ATP hydrolyzed into two steps, one of ∼90° and the second of ∼30°. They show that the +90° rotation is dependent on ATP binding, whereas the 30° step is independent of ATP binding, and they propose that this is due to product release. By reference to the structures described here, the rotation step of ∼90° could correspond to the partial unwinding and rotation of the α-helical coiled-coil that is a distinctive feature of the γ-subunit.Different Arrangements of the C-terminal Domain of the ε-SubunitThe position of the C-terminal α-helical domain of ε is radically different between E. coli F1and both the DCCD-inhibited MF1 and the yeast F1F0 structures (Table I). In the E. coli F1 structure, these two α-helices are separated and stretch upwards to contact the α3β3hexamer. In the other two structures the two α-helices are in a hairpin structure compactly folded against the β-sandwich and located toward the F0 in the intact ATP synthase. It has recently been shown that both positions of the C-terminal domain can exist inE. coli F1F0 (28Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It proved possible to cross-link a cysteine placed at position 118 of ε to a cysteine at position 99 of γ, as predicted by the model of the isolated γ and ε subunits reported by Rodgers and Wilce (9Rodgers A.J.W. Wilce M.C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This initial evidence that the purified complex of γ and ε is organized as in the intact enzyme is now strongly confirmed here. What remains to be established is the precise location of the very C-terminal helix 110–138, which is not well represented by density in the 4.4-Å resolution map of E. coli (Fig. 3 A).As the E. coli ATP synthase is fully functional and therefore must work as a rotary motor in mutants missing the C-terminal domain of ε (28Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the movements of this domain described here are not tied compulsorily to the unwinding and rotation of the γ- and ε-subunits. As discussed already, the β-sandwich and C-terminal domains of ε appear to have separate functions. The up arrangement of the α-helices of ε causes inhibition of ATPase activity (but not ATP synthesis) when ADP is trapped in the enzyme (28Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). There remains a debate about whether this inhibitory ADP is in a catalytic or noncatalytic site(s). The F1F0 ATP synthase is an enzyme ubiquitous to bacteria, plants, and animals. It utilizes a proton gradient across a membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar).

In particular, the extension of the long coiled-coil α-helices that constitute the “axle” of the F1 particle is seen in the structure of isolated γ′ε as is the helix that includes residues 88–103. On the other hand, other density features putatively identified as α-helices are now seen to correspond to regions of β-sheet.Do the Structures of E. coli and Bovine F1 Represent Distinct Functional States?As shown in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 and in Table I, when the α3β3 hexamers of E. coli and DCCD-inhibited bovine F1 are superimposed, the “stalk” subunits (γ and ε in E. coli) differ substantially. Relative to the bovine enzyme, the two long, coiled-coil α-helices of γ that form the axle of the F1 particle unwind and rotate substantially (Fig. 5) rotating the β-sandwich domain of the ε-subunit around the central axis by 81° compared with its counterpart in the bovine enzyme (Fig. 6 C). There is also a radial displacement and significant reorientation of the ε-subunit.The nucleotide content of the DCCD-treated enzyme has been reported (8Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Mg-ADP is bound in two β-subunits, whereas the catalytic site in the third is empty. Unfortunately, the level of resolution obtained so far for the crystals of E. coli F1do not allow identification of nucleotide occupancy. The enzyme was crystallized in the presence of Mg-AMP-PNP and MgATP, along with azide and it is likely that some catalytic sites contain AMP-PNP or other ligands resulting from the expected hydrolysis of AMP-PNP and ATP during crystallization. Likewise, the nucleotide content of catalytic sites in the yeast F1F0 structure remains undefined, although crystallization conditions were more similar to those of the ECF1 than the DCCD-MF1 structure. Without the detailed understanding of catalytic site occupancy in the three crystal forms, it is not possible to relate the movements of γ and ε with individual steps in catalysis. However, we believe that the different states are physiologically relevant structures because such movements of the γ- and ε-subunits have been seen before within the E. coli F1 and shown to be nucleotide-dependent. For example, Wilkens and Capaldi (23Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1994; 375: 43-51Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) used cryoelectron microscopy to examine the position of the ε-subunit within the α3β3 hexagon. The ε-subunit was specifically labeled with a small (14 Å) gold particle at residue 38. A corresponding electron-dense feature was found close to a β-subunit with uncleaved ATP trapped in the enzyme (by rapid freezing) but moved along with the γ-subunit counterclockwise to the adjacent α-subunit when ATP was allowed to turn over before freezing (Fig. 6, A and B). This represents a movement of the ε-subunit of ∼20 Å. As shown in Fig. 6, the 81° rotation of ε suggested by the respective crystal structures is somewhat greater than that suggested in the electron micrographs. The overall 20-Å movement of ε shown by the electron microscopy is, however, remarkably close to the 23-Å difference in the positioning of ε in the two crystal structures, emphasizing the essential concordance of the two very different structural approaches.Also, a nucleotide-dependent shift in the position of Glu108 in the ε-subunit has been observed in cross-linking experiments (24Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26645-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, a cysteine at this site can be cross-linked to an α-subunit, whereas in ADP + Mg2+ + Pi, the cysteine can be covalently linked to residue 381 at the bottom of a β-subunit. Finally, Yasuda and co-workers (26Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar, 27Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) have recently followed the rotation of the γ-subunit in the α3β3 subcomplex ofBacillus PS3 F1. They were able to dissect the 120° rotation that occurs with each ATP hydrolyzed into two steps, one of ∼90° and the second of ∼30°. They show that the +90° rotation is dependent on ATP binding, whereas the 30° step is independent of ATP binding, and they propose that this is due to product release. By reference to the structures described here, the rotation step of ∼90° could correspond to the partial unwinding and rotation of the α-helical coiled-coil that is a distinctive feature of the γ-subunit.Different Arrangements of the C-terminal Domain of the ε-SubunitThe position of the C-terminal α-helical domain of ε is radically different between E. coli F1and both the DCCD-inhibited MF1 and the yeast F1F0 structures (Table I). In the E. coli F1 structure, these two α-helices are separated and stretch upwards to contact the α3β3hexamer. In the other two structures the two α-helices are in a hairpin structure compactly folded against the β-sandwich and located toward the F0 in the intact ATP synthase. It has recently been shown that both positions of the C-terminal domain can exist inE. coli F1F0 (28Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It proved possible to cross-link a cysteine placed at position 118 of ε to a cysteine at position 99 of γ, as predicted by the model of the isolated γ and ε subunits reported by Rodgers and Wilce (9Rodgers A.J.W. Wilce M.C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This initial evidence that the purified complex of γ and ε is organized as in the intact enzyme is now strongly confirmed here. What remains to be established is the precise location of the very C-terminal helix 110–138, which is not well represented by density in the 4.4-Å resolution map of E. coli (Fig. 3 A).As the E. coli ATP synthase is fully functional and therefore must work as a rotary motor in mutants missing the C-terminal domain of ε (28Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the movements of this domain described here are not tied compulsorily to the unwinding and rotation of the γ- and ε-subunits. As discussed already, the β-sandwich and C-terminal domains of ε appear to have separate functions. The up arrangement of the α-helices of ε causes inhibition of ATPase activity (but not ATP synthesis) when ADP is trapped in the enzyme (28Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). There remains a debate about whether this inhibitory ADP is in a catalytic or noncatalytic site(s). Re-evaluation of the 4.4-Å resolution electron density map ofE. coli F1 (7Hausrath A.C. Grüber G. Matthews B.W. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13697-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) shows that it is consistent with the 2.1-Å resolution crystal structure of the isolated γε complex (9Rodgers A.J.W. Wilce M.C.J.

https://openalex.org/W2067031836,"Rac1 has been shown to activate a NADPH oxidase complex producing superoxide anions in a variety of mammalian cell types. We evaluated the impact of Rac1-induced reactive oxygen species production on the turnover of Rac1 itself in human aortic endothelial cells. The concentration of a constitutively active mutant of Rac1 (Rac1V12) was increased by treatment of the cells with diphenylene iodinium (DPI), an inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase. Such an effect was not observed for the dominant negative form of Rac1 (Rac1N17). We showed a decrease in proteolytic degradation of Rac1V12 in the presence of DPI, and showed that short term treatment with H2O2 reverses the effect of DPI. We found that proteasome inhibitors (lactacystin and MG132) increased Rac1V12 protein level. In support of this finding, we have identified in the primary sequence of Rac1 a potential destruction box domain, which is known to be a signal for protein degradation mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. We show that Rac1V12 is ubiquitinated before degradation. By contrast Rac1N17 induces an accumulation of the ubiquitinated form of Rac1. These results suggest that Rac1 activation of NADPH oxidase is necessary for the proteolytic degradation of Rac1 itself.

Hall A. Exp. Cell. Res. 1995; 253: 166-179Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Rac1, which belongs to this family, is known to induce membrane ruffling and is also involved in serum-stimulated DNA synthesis and transcription activity through activation of serum response factor and NFκB1 (2Moore K.A. Sethi R. Doanes A.M. Johnson T.M. Pracyk J.B. Kirby M. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of multiple targets for Rac1, which include p65 PAK, phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, myosin light chain kinase, NADPH oxidase, and POSH (Plenty OfSH3s), the biochemical steps connecting Rac1 to its effects are not yet clearly established (3Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Among the downstream effectors of Rac1, the NADPH oxidase responsible for converting molecular O2 into O2−, is a molecular complex that includes gp91 phox and the associated subunit, p22 phox, which together form the flavocytochrome b558. p67 phox, p47 phox, and p40 phox are cytosolic subunits of this multimolecular oxidase. This complex initially identified in phagocytic cells needs GTP-Rac1 for its activation, which occurs through the interaction of Rac1 with p67 phox (4Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, the oxidase system is silent and dissociated, with components residing in both cytosolic and plasma membrane compartments. Upon stimulation, there is a translocation of the soluble components to the membrane where the active oxidase is assembled and produces superoxide anion (5Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1339-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It now has been shown in several reports that a NADPH oxidase-like complex is present in non-phagocytic cells and that Rac1 induces superoxide production by this enzyme (4Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J.

Recently, the cDNA for five new human homologues of gp91 phox have been cloned (8Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D.

The Duox group represents a large homologue of gp91 phox with an additional peroxide domain compared with the Nox group (for review, see Ref. 12Lambeth J.D. Cheng G. Arnold R.S. Edens W.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 459-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Using this new terminology, Nox2 represents gp91 phox . The others Nox isoforms are not present in inflammatory cells and are low output enzymes compared with the phagocytic complex (high output) involved in the oxidative burst (7Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). In addition to the well known toxic effect of high doses of reactive oxygen species (ROS), redox reactions have gained attention as important chemical processes that regulate signal transduction, now referred to as redox signaling (13Burdon R.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 775-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Redox signaling has been shown to involve phosphatase inhibition, activation of transcription factors like AP1 and NFκB, and calcium signal modulation (14Suzuki Y.J. Forman H.J. Sevanian A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 15Herrlich P. Bohmer F.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Rac1-induced ROS production has been shown to induce Rho activation through phospholipase A2 activation (16Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.G. de Vries-Smits A.M. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus Rac1-induced ROS production may play a role in mitogen-induced cell signaling. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that a Rac1 effector site critical for the activation of NADPH oxidase is also required for the mitogenic effect of Rac1 in rat embryonic fibroblasts (17Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17991-17994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shown that Rac1-induced NADPH oxidase activation leads to transcriptional activation of the cyclin D1 promoter (18Page K. Li J. Hodge J.A. Liu P.T. Vanden Hoek T.L. Becker L.B. Pestell R.G. Rosner M.R. Hershenson M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22065-22071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, oxidants are known to inhibit proteases, mainly cysteine proteases with a reactive thiol in their active site like calpain (19Guttmann R.P. Elce J.S. Bell P.D. Isbell J.C. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2005-2012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas they might activate other proteases like the proteasome, which is involved in degradation of oxidized proteins (20Sitte N. Merker K. Grune T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this report we evaluated the effect of the redox status of cells on Rac1 protein turnover and degradation mediated by proteases in a model where Rac1 is overexpressed, using a replication-incompetent adenovirus coding for either the mutant of human Rac1 (constitutively activated Rac1V12 or dominant negative Rac1N17) in human aortic endothelial cells. We show that inhibition of Rac1-induced NADPH oxidase activation by DPI leads to a stabilization of overexpressed Rac1 by reducing Rac1 degradation. We show that Rac1 degradation takes place at the proteasomal level after ubiquitination of the protein. We also provide evidence that Rac1 activates the proteasome through a superoxide-dependent mechanism. Our data indicate that Rac1-induced superoxide production is connected to a feedback loop where Rac1 protein turnover is accelerated via the increased degradation of Rac1 by the proteasome. Such a feedback loop may represent a switch off mechanism for Rac1-GTP-induced activation of the NADPH oxidase, as an additional means to control ROS production in the cell. The recombinant replication incompetent adenovirus Ad.N17 Rac1 and Ad.V12 Rac1, containing respectively the c-Myc-tagged dominant-negative and the c-Myc-tagged constitutively activated form of Rac1, were constructed by homologous recombination in 293 cells using the adenovirus-based plasmid JM17, as previously described (21Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protease inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA); the c-Myc and Rac1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), respectively; the anti-ubiquitin antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Cells were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Easytag™l-[35S]methionine was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) were cultured in EGM2 medium provided by the manufacturer (Clonetics, San Diego, CA). Experiments were performed between passages 4 and 10, and the serum-deprived conditions were obtained by overnight incubation in EBM2 medium containing 1% of fetal bovine serum. The cells were seeded 24 h before infection at a density of 120 cells/mm2 in a T75 culture flask. Adenoviral transduction was performed by diluting the viral vector in 4 ml of serum-deprived medium at the desired multiplicity of infection overnight, after which the virus-containing medium was removed and replaced by fresh EGM2 medium. The control adenovirus dl312, which lacks the cDNA insert, was used as a control for adenovirus infection. In addition, an adenovirus containing a cDNA insert coding for β-galactosidase was also used as control in the superoxide ion production experiments (21Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after exposure to adenoviruses, the cells were serum-depleted overnight and then lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 145 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (i.e. leupeptin, chymostatin, antipain, pepstatin, and AEBSF)). The cells were harvested on ice, sonicated twice for 15 s each time, and the debris pelleted in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed, for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was estimated using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). A total of 5–10 μg of protein from the cell lysates were separated on a 5–20% SDS-PAGE, for 1 h, at 150 V. Gels were transferred 1.5 h at 200 V to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Overexpressed Rac1 was detected using a monoclonal mouse anti-c-Myc epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) secondary antibody. The chemiluminescent signal was detected on radiographic film and/or a phosphorimager using Super-Signal reagent (Pierce) as instructed by the manufacturer. In some cases, simultaneous measurement of tubulin or actin levels was used to confirm equal protein loading. HAEC transduced with the Rac1V12 or Rac1N17 adenovirus (multiplicity of infection = 300) were serum-deprived overnight and placed in EBM2 medium without methionine (EBM2−) for 30 min. A pulse period of 30 min in EBM2− with [35S]methionine (0.05 mCi/ml) followed by a chase period varying between 0 and 360 min were performed before lysis of the cells. Cell lysates were normalized for protein content, immunoprecipitated with an anti-c-Myc antibody, analyzed by Western blot, and visualized on autoradiographic films. These experiments were performed with or without DPI (10 μm) added to the cell medium at the beginning of the serum deprivation period and present for all subsequent steps. Forty-eight hours after the beginning of the infection, cells were serum deprived overnight and then total RNA were extracted using a RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The amount of RNA isolated was estimated spectrophotometrically and adjust for each samples to 2 μg/μl in DEPC water. Reverse transcription was performed on 2 μg of total RNA with the superscript preamplification system for first strand cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies, Inc.). Quantification of Rac1 mRNA was performed using real time RT-PCR (Taqman PCR, ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system, PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems). We used 5′-CCCTATCCTATCCGCAAACA-3′ and 5′-CGCACCTCAGGATACCACTT-3′ as primers and 6FAM-TCCCTTGTGAGTCCTGCATCA-TAMRA as fluorescent probe to amplify a 100-base pair fragment of Rac1. The 18 S mitochondrial mRNA was used with the following primers: 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3′ and 5′-GCTGGAATTACCGCGGCT-3′, and the fluorescent probe VIC-TGCTGGCACCAGACTTGCCCTC-TAMRA for internal calibration. The assay was optimized for efficiency relative to the target primers and the internal calibration primers using 50 nm Rac1 primers, 25 nm 18 S primers, and 100 nm amounts of each fluorescent probe. Thermal conditions used were 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C with a total of 40 cycles. Real time RT-PCR was also performed on some total RNA extracts to control for possible contamination by genomic or exogenous DNA. All results were normalized to the content of Rac cDNA in the control adenovirus. HAECs were transduced with Ad.N17 Rac1, Ad.V12 Rac1, Ad.βgal, or control adenovirus dl312 at a multiplicity of infection of 400. After 48 h, cells were harvested and resuspended in Krebs-Hepes buffer. NADPH (1 mm) was added at time 0 and the cells incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. A total of 105 cells were then added to 25 μm lucigenin in KH buffer, and chemiluminescence was measured for 60 s using a Lumat LB 9507 Berthold luminometer. Results were expressed as relative light units/105cells. Rac1 has been shown to activate a NADPH oxidase-like enzyme, which produces superoxide ion in human aortic endothelial cells and other non-phagocytic cells (4Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). To confirm the activation of the NADPH oxidase by Rac1 in HAEC, we measured superoxide production using a lucigenin assay. HAEC induced to overexpress a constitutively activated Rac1 mutant displayed heightened superoxide production relative to cells transduced with control adenovirus; which could be inhibited by exposure of the cells to DPI (Fig. 1). Because a concentration higher than 25 μm lucigenin has been reported to generate superoxide on its own, we also measured the production of superoxide or H2O2 using water-soluble tetrazolium salt or 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein, respectively. In each case Rac1V12 endothelial cells exhibit a heightened ROS production compared with control or Rac1N17 (data not shown). We also examined whether the redox status of the cells, and particularly the inhibition of the NADPH oxidase by DPI, modulates the expression of Rac1. In HAEC transduced to overexpress the constitutively activated mutant of Rac1 (Rac1V12), inhibition of NADPH oxidase by DPI led to a strong increase in the protein level of Rac1V12. Such increase in Rac1V12 expression could be abrogated by exposure of HAEC during 0.5 h to H2O2 (0.5–1 mm). This effect of H2O2 on Rac1V12 expression was dose-dependent and indicates that ROS derived from superoxide modulate the level of Rac1 protein. In addition, neither DPI nor H2O2affect the level of expression of Rac1N17. These results suggest that superoxide production induced by activated Rac1 contributes to a feedback loop that controls Rac1 expression (Fig.2). Based on the above, it does not appear that the mild changes in mRNA could account for the marked alteration in Rac1 protein seen after DPI treatments and other alterations of the redox status of the cells. Using reverse transcription and real time RT-PCR (23Fink L. Seeger W. Ermert L. Hanze J. Stahl U. Grimminger F. Kummer W. Bohle R.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1329-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), we found a slight but nonsignificant increase in Rac1 mRNA levels by overnight treatment with DPI (10 μm) in Rac1V12-transfected cells. In addition, DPI had no effect on Rac1N17 mRNA levels in HAEC-transfected cells. Hence, it did not appear that the mild changes in mRNA could account for the marked increase in Rac1 protein seen after DPI and other alteration of the redox status of the cells. Because short term treatment with H2O2 induced a dose-dependent decrease of Rac1 protein concentration, we performed pulse-chase experiments to confirm that inhibition of NADPH oxidase regulated the stability of Rac1. Pulse-chase experiments (Fig.3) on HAEC induced to overexpress Rac1V12 confirmed a longer half-life of RacV12in the presence of DPI, compared with conditions without DPI. By contrast, DPI did not affect Rac1N17 half-life. These results suggested that activated Rac1 degradation was increased in the presence of superoxide and/or derived ROS. DPI is an inhibitor of flavoproteins and could have induced the observed effects via a mechanism independent of NADPH oxidase. Another key flavoprotein present in HAEC is endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). As a control, we have shown that l-NAME, an inhibitor of eNOS, was without effects on the level of Rac1V12 protein (Fig.2). We have showed that the half-life of Rac1V12 is sensitive to the presence of antioxidants. To further characterize this point, we studied the effect of various protease inhibitors on the level of Rac1V12 in HAEC (Fig.4). Lactacystin and MG132 (proteasome inhibitors) increased Rac1V12 concentration in HAEC. In contrast, leupeptin (a trypsin-like and cysteine protease inhibitor) and AEBSF (a serine protease inhibitor) had no effect on Rac1V12 concentration. Consistent with this, Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor; has been shown to increase the virus yield after an adenoviral transduction (24Chiou S.K. White E. Virology. 1998; 244: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), an effect that may explain the slight increase in Rac1V12 concentration we observed in the presence of these inhibitors. By analogy with another pathway, NF-κB/IκB, where the stabilization of IκB is dependent on the redox status of the cell, we studied the effect of ubiquitination on the stability of Rac1V12 as a function of NADPH oxidase inhibition. The effect of lactacystin, an inhibitor of the proteasome, increased the concentration of Rac1V12 protein (Fig. 4). Taken together, these experiments suggest that regulation of Rac1V12 level involves the ubiquitin/proteasome system. To study the degradation of Rac1 by the proteasome, we measured the ubiquitination of Rac1V12 protein. We found that Rac1V12 is ubiquitinated and that the level of ubiquitination is increased by the lactacystin (proteasome inhibitor) (Fig. 5), which is consistent with a degradation process mediated by the proteasome and requiring ubiquitination. In addition, the level of ubiquitinated Rac1V12 is clearly increased in presence of DPI. It was also observed that Rac1N17 is markedly ubiquitinated, but DPI did not affect the level of ubiquitination of Rac1N17. Hence, our data suggest that Rac1 is ubiquitinated; however, the degradation by the proteasome of ubiquitinated Rac1 is strongly dependent on the redox status of the cell. Thus, ROS promote the degradation of ubiquitinated Rac1, whereas anti-oxidants such as DPI or the NADPH-oxidase inhibitory effect of Rac1N17 block the degradation of ubiquitinated Rac1 by the proteasome. An NADPH oxidase activity regulated by Rac is present in most cells, from plants to mammals. Production of superoxide in plant cells and phagocytes is a part of the host defense mechanism and aims at killing microorganisms and other parasites. In non-phagocytic cells, Rac-induced superoxide production has been involved in signal transduction and gene regulation, including activation of Rho GTPase in fibroblasts (16Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.G. de Vries-Smits A.M. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L.

Cell. Res. 1995; 253: 166-179Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In addition to these effects, oxidants are also known to regulate directly the activity of several proteases, either by modifying a thiol group within the active site or indirectly via phosphatase inhibition or calcium level modulation. A putative effect of Rac, and consequent superoxide production, on protease activity had not been documented. Such an effect on proteases like calpain or proteasome might contribute to Rac-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and/or gene regulation. Previously, Rho exchange factors or GTPase-activating proteins have been considered as the switch for these signaling pathways, mediated by the exchange of GDP or the hydrolysis of GTP, in a way that modulates the interaction of Rho proteins with their downstream effectors. An alternative regulatory mechanism could involve the turnover of these important proteins and their mode of synthesis and degradation. To study this putative regulatory mechanism, we expressed Myc-tagged mutated isoforms of human Rac1, namely the constitutively activated Rac1V12 and the dominant negative Rac1N17, using recombinant replication-incompetent adenoviruses as vectors. Rac1V12 induced superoxide production, as detected by lucigenin assay, through an NADPH oxidase-like enzyme, when compared with a control null adenovirus (21Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activation could be inhibited by DPI and is absent in experiments performed with Rac1N17. Next, we evaluated the effect of inhibition of NADPH oxidase on Rac1V12 protein level in subconfluent cultures of endothelial cells infected with our three adenoviruses. The results showed that inhibition of NADPH oxidase by DPI increased Rac1 protein level. This result is not because of an effect of DPI on eNOS (another flavoprotein), because l-NAME, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme, did not affect Rac1 protein level. Such DPI-induced increase in Rac1V12 might be because of increased transcription, stabilization of Rac1 mRNA, or to decreased Rac1V12protein degradation. We showed that DPI did not induce a significant increase of Rac1 mRNA levels in our experimental conditions. Pulse-chase experiments clearly evidenced that DPI decreased ROS-dependent Rac1V12 protein degradation. Furthermore, short term treatment of cultures with H2O2 induced a strong decrease in Rac1V12 protein level, data consistent with an effect of ROS on Rac1 protein stability. Indeed, pulse-chase experiment showed a relatively short half-life for the constitutively activated form of Rac1, and this half-life was greatly increased in presence of DPI, probably as a result of protease inhibition induce by DPI. To test this hypothesis, we studied various protease inhibitors to characterize the degradation pathway for Rac1. Non-cell permeant inhibitors like leupeptin and AEBSF did not protect Rac1V12from degradation, whereas Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, induced a slight increase in Rac1 protein, which could be accounted for by an effect of this inhibitor on viral protein translation, as evidenced previously (24Chiou S.K. White E. Virology. 1998; 244: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition to DPI, lactacystin and MG132, both inhibitors of the proteasome, were by far the most effective in inducing Rac1V12 stabilization. The proteasome is a multisubunit complex, the 26 S proteasome. The proteolytic core of this complex consists of the 20 S proteasome and also a regulatory complex composed of multiple ATPases. This multisubunit complex is located either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm (26Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic proteins with short life are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Important elements of signal transduction pathway like IκB are degraded by this complex, indicating a central role for this protease system in cell signaling and fate. We showed that lactacystin increased the level of Rac1V12protein, whereas the level of mRNA was decreased by 50%, in support to the degradation of Rac1V12 by the proteasome. To elucidate the mechanism of degradation of Rac1 by the proteasome, we sought a sequence known to lead to proteasome-mediated protein degradation within Rac1. There are two known sequences that mark proteins for proteasome degradation: (i) a PEST sequence and (ii) a destruction box (26Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). A PEST sequence is a polypeptide sequences enriched in proline (P), glutamate (E), serine (S), and threonine (T). We did not find such sequence with Rac1. The destruction box was originally found in mitotic cyclins and other cell-cycle regulators like anaphase inhibitors and spindle-associated proteins (27Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). The destruction box is a conserved motif made of a 9-amino acid sequence: R1-(A/T)2-(A)3-L4-(G)5-X 6-(I/V)7-(G/T)8-(N)9, located near (40–50 amino acids from) the N-terminal domain of the protein. The parentheses indicate the preferred amino acid for each site, but only R1 and L4 are required for degradation; however, the mechanistic role of the destruction box is not known (27Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). We identified a possible destruction box at the amino acid 174 of Rac1 (19 amino acids before the C terminus) consisting ofRAVLCPPPV, which contains the essential R1 and L4 residues. Such a sequence present in Rac1 is consistent with our data on Rac1 degradation. However, ubiquitination of the target protein is required prior to degradation by the proteasome. The ubiquitin-conjugating machinery consists in three sets of enzymes called E1, E2, and E3. E1 generates a high energy thiol ester intermediate of ubiquitin, which involves an internal cysteine residue. The “activated” ubiquitin is transferred from E1 to a cysteine residue belonging to the E2 enzyme, thereby generating yet another thiol ester intermediate. The E3 enzyme binds directly or indirectly to target substrates and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from the thiol ester intermediate of E2 to an amide linkage with the substrate, leading to recognition for proteolysis (27Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Several isoforms of E1–E3 enzymes have been identified and some isoforms of the E2 enzyme are found at the membrane (26Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Because of the implication of responsive cysteines and the membrane localization of theses enzymes, it is tempting to speculate that Rac-induced superoxide production might alter some of the thiols necessary to the process of ubiquitination. We showed that Rac1 is indeed ubiquitinated prior to degradation. Treatment with lactacystin led to an increase in ubiquitinated Rac1, consistent with a role of the proteasome in turnover of Rac1. As levels of expression of Rac1V12 in the presence and absence of DPI appear different, we expressed Rac1 ubiquitination as a ratio of total recombinant protein present in each conditions. Rac1V12displayed the lowest level of ubiquitination, whereas Rac1N17 had the highest. Intermediate levels of ubiquitination were found with Rac1V12-expressing cells treated with DPI and lactacystin. These results indicate that the putative destruction box found in the Rac1 sequence is fully functional. In addition to the degradation of Rac1 by the proteasome, these results strongly suggest that Rac1 may modulate the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway itself. Indeed, the high level of ubiquitination of the Rac1 protein in a context deprived of ROS production (i.e. with Rac1N17) is consistent with an involvement of Rac1, and consequent ROS production, in the activation of this proteolytic pathway. In such experimental conditions (i.e. with Rac1N17), although ubiquitination proceeded, the proteolytic reaction appeared to be limiting. However, the fact that DPI treatment did not result in a ubiquitination level as great as that obtained with Rac1N17 may reflect the fact that a downstream pathway, independent of ROS, might also be at play. This observation is reminiscent of NFκB translocation induced by both redox-dependent and redox-independent Rac downstream pathways (21Sulciner D.J. Irani K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the inhibitory effect of lactacystin on Rac mRNA levels might be explained by a decreased NFκB activity that is required for adenoviral replication. The differential effect of DPI and lactacystin might best be explained by subcellular distribution. Indeed, Rac-induced superoxide is produced at the membrane and is nearly instantly processed locally by dismutation, and further processing by additional reducing agents, such that the effect of superoxide is entirely proximal. In contrast, lactacystin is a cell-permeant molecule that can inhibit the proteasome no matter its location. Rac3V12, but not wild type Rac3, has been shown to bind cullin-1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) in yeast (28Senadheera D. Haataja L. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 8: 127-133PubMed Google Scholar). Binding to cullin-1 does not seem to affect Rac3V12 protein levels. These authors reported that binding to cullin-1 occurred also with Rac1, Rac2, and RhoA within mammalian cell lysates. It is interesting to note that these three isoforms of Rac possess the putative destruction box in their sequence. However, Rac3, when compared with Rac1 and Rac2, displays the least conserved C terminus sequence in proximity to the destruction box. Such difference might modify accessibility to the destruction box, explaining the differential effect of the proteasome on Rac isoforms stability. Thus, the proteasome is composed of many proteins that provide a complex regulation of Rac stability in the cell. It was instructive to note, with a series of microarray experiments on Rac1V12expressed in yeast, that Rac1 both induced and repressed various ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin proteases through ROS-dependent and ROS-independent pathways. 2K. Vata and P. Goldschmidt-Clermont, unpublished results. With this report, we demonstrate that the turnover of Rac is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway in a redox sensitive fashion. Rac1-induced ROS activate the degradation of Rac1V12 in endothelial cells. As proteasome activity has been implicated in cellular activities such as motility (29Oikawa T. Sasaki T. Nakamura M. Shimamura M. Tanahashi N. Omura S. Tanaka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), this regulatory mechanism might result in local degradation of activated Rac1. Hence, in addition to the well known regulation of small G-proteins through nucleotide cycling, this alternative mechanism of regulation for small G-proteins might be particularly relevant in conditions of altered redox homeostasis, as seen upon activation of many cells, and in particular, endothelial cells."

In the following report, the activity and substrate specificity of the human HAT-B complex and of recombinant yeast Hat1p have been examined, using synthetic H4 NH2-terminal peptides as substrates. As expected, the unacetylated H4 peptide was a good substrate for acetylation by yeast Hat1p and human HAT-B, while the K5/K12-diacetylated peptide was not significantly acetylated. Notably, an H4 peptide previously diacetylated on lysines 8 and 16 was a very poor substrate for acetylation by either yeast Hat1p or human HAT-B. Treating the K8/K16-diacetylated peptide with histone deacetylase prior to the HAT-B reaction raised acetylation at K5/K12 to 70–80% of control levels.

Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Hat1p has a curved shape; acetyl-CoA binds within a depression on the concave surface of the protein, with the acetyl group designating the active site. A model has been proposed for the enzyme-H4 interaction, based on the assumptions that the H4 tail has an extended conformation, that Lys12 (the lysine more readily acetylated by yeast Hat1p) lies adjacent to the carbonyl group of acetyl-CoA, and that Hat1p itself undergoes no major conformational changes after binding the substrate. By applying these guidelines, it has been proposed that the region of the H4 tail between Lys8 and Lys16 binds along a channel that is long enough to accommodate 6–7 amino acids (27Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). When Lys12 is positioned adjacent to the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA, Lys8 and Lys16 are found to lie opposite two acidic patches at the ends of the channel, theoretically engaging in electrostatic interactions that hold the tail in place. Aligning Lys5 near the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA also yields a reasonable, though somewhat less favorable, fit. However, modeling Lys8 adjacent to acetyl-CoA produces a steric clash with the channel (27Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. 1998; 63: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As noted above, the present model for the binding of the H4 tail to Hat1 predicts that the lysine residues at positions 8 and 16 of H4 play a significant role in stabilizing the Hat1-histone tail interaction. It therefore may be postulated that abrogating the positive charge of Lys8 and/or Lys16 by acetylation should decrease the ability of the H4 tail to bind Hat1 and thus interfere with enzyme activity. In the following report we have tested this prediction directly, by performing HAT assays in vitro using several acetylated H4 NH2-terminal peptides. We find that the acetylation of Lys8 and/or Lys16 of H4 dramatically reduces the activity of recombinant yeast Hat1p and native human HAT-B in vitro.

Cytosolic extracts (S100 extract) from HeLa cells were prepared as described previously (19Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,29Perry C.A. Dadd C.A. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13605-13614Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The HeLa S100 cytosolic extract contains HAT-B as the sole HAT activity, which exclusively acetylates the H4 NH2 terminus on lysines 5 and 12 (19). Human HAT-B activity was measured using HeLa cytosolic extracts and an in vitropeptide assay (30Horiuchi K. Fujimoto D. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 69: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), as described previously (19Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Synthetic 20-mer peptides (typically 0.1 μg/μl final concentration) corresponding to the first 18 amino-terminal residues (plus a C-terminal Gly-Cys coupling linker) of either unacetylated or variously acetylated NH2 termini of human histone H4 (19Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were incubated in a reaction volume of 80 μl in HB buffer (20 mm Hepes, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, adjusted to pH 7.5 with KOH) containing 40 μl of HeLa S100, an additional 60 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 5 mm sodium butyrate, and 4–8 μCi/ml [3H]acetyl-CoA (1–3 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), for the times indicated in the figure legends; in some cases the reaction volume was doubled. All peptides used in this study were quantitated by mass spectroscopy, and all experiments included parallel reactions using the unacetylated peptide as a positive control. Reactions were stopped by spotting in duplicate onto Whatman P-81 filters, washing with 50 mm NaHCO3(pH 9.2), and then with 100% ethanol. Filters were allowed to air dry and then were analyzed by scintillation counting. Control experiments performed in the absence of added peptides, or using a Lys5/Lys12-diacetylated peptide, confirmed that incorporation was minimal in the absence of proper peptide substrates. In vitro peptide assays using recombinant Hat1p from S. cerevisiae were performed following a modified procedure of Kleff et al. (26Kleff S. Andrulis E.D. Anderson C.W. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24674-24677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar): 40 ng of Hat1p was incubated with synthetic peptides (0.1 μg/μl) in HB buffer containing 75 mm Tris-HCl (diluted from a 1 m stock solution (pH 8.8)), 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium butyrate, and 4 μCi/ml [3H]acetyl-CoA (final reaction volume of 80 μl) for the times indicated. Reactions were stopped and spotted onto Whatman P-81 filters as described above. Recombinant Hat1p was prepared as described previously (27Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). HeLa histone deacetylase extract was prepared as described by Yoshida et al. (31Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells (250 ml) were washed twice with HDAC buffer (15 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 5% glycerol, and 0.2 mm EDTA). Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min and were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation (14,00 × g; 10 min; 4 °C) and resuspended (60 A260/ml;A260 measured in SDS) in HDAC buffer plus 1m (NH4)2SO4. After a second homogenization, samples were sonicated for 10 s and pelleted as described above. The supernatant, containing histone deacetylase activity, was brought to a final concentration of 3.5m (NH4)2SO4, kept on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of HDAC buffer and dialyzed overnight to 1 liter of HDAC buffer. Samples were then stored at −70 °C. HDAC activity was monitored using [3H]acetate-labeled acetylated histones as substrates. Following the procedure of Inoue and Fujimoto (32Inoue A. Fujimoto D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 220: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), 8 μg of peptide were added to 37 μl of HDAC extract and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were boiled for 5 min and cooled. HDAC extracts treated in this manner contained no contaminating HAT activity, as determined by HAT assay. HDAC-treated peptides were then used in subsequent HAT-B reactions, containing 45 μl of deacetylated peptide/HDAC extract, 40 μl of HeLa S100 cytosolic extract, 60 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 20 mm sodium butyrate, and 0.32 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA, adjusted to a final reaction volume of 100 μl with HB buffer. Histone H4 NH2-terminal peptides were synthesized in various isoforms, representing the following acetylation states: unacetylated; monoacetylated at either Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, or Lys16 (termed Mono-5, Mono-8, Mono-12, and Mono-16, respectively); and diacetylated at either Lys5/Lys12, or Lys8/Lys16 (Di-5/12 and Di-8/16). The peptides were then used to examine the activity of recombinant yeast Hat1p, as measured by the transfer of radiolabeled acetate from [3H]acetyl-CoA. All acetylation reactions were performed in the presence of sodium butyrate, to inhibit possible deacetylation during incubation. The results are presented in Fig.1. As predicted, an H4 peptide already acetylated on lysines 5 and 12 (the sites acetylated by Hat1 enzymes) was an extremely poor substrate (Fig.1). The depressed acetylation of the Di-5/12 peptide also verifies that no significant deacetylation is occurring under our experimental conditions. In contrast, both the unacetylated peptide and the peptide previously acetylated on Lys5 were readily acetylated by Hat1p. Labeling of the Mono-5 peptide was reduced relative to the unacetylated substrate (Figs. 1 and 2). This is as expected, since only one substrate lysine is available for radiolabeling; however, other factors may also be involved (see “Discussion”). Notably, the Mono-12 peptide was acetylated poorly (Figs. 1 and 2), consistent with the great preference of native and recombinant yeast Hat1p for Lys12 over Lys5(24Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 26Kleff S. Andrulis E.D. Anderson C.W. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24674-24677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The effect of prior acetylation Lys8 and Lys16(which are not substrate lysines for Hat1p) on Hat1p activity was then examined (Fig. 1). As predicted from the proposed interaction of the H4 tail with Hat1p (27Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), acetylation at either Lys8 or Lys16 significantly reduced the ability of Hat1p to acetylate its substrate lysines, with acetylation at Lys16having a somewhat greater effect. Strikingly, the Lys8/Lys16-diacetylated peptide was almost refractory to acetylation by Hat1p, yielding results close to those obtained with the 5/12-diacetylated peptide, in which the substrate lysines are already acetylated. A summary of the results from several independent experiments are presented in Fig. 2, in which incorporation of radiolabeled acetate into each of the substrates is presented relative to that of the unacetylated peptide, which was always tested as a positive control. The combined data demonstrate that lysines 8 and 16 of H4 are critical to Hat1p activity (at least in vitro). The experiments were then repeated using the human Hat1 enzyme, which in vivo resides in the HAT-B complex (19Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 96-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (286) Google Scholar). One of the hallmark features of HAT-B enzymes is their fractionation into the cytosol following cell disruption. We have previously shown that HAT-B is the sole HAT activity present in a cytosolic extract prepared from HeLa cells (“S100” extract) and that human HAT-B acetylates H4 exclusively in the Lys5/Lys12 deposition pattern (19Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Moreover, HAT-B in the S100 comprises a native complex of ∼100 kDA (19Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which contains Hat1 and p46 (20Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 96-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (286) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible to study HAT-B activity using the S100 extract as a native enzyme source (19Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Unacetylated, as well as Mono-8, Mono-16, Di-5/12, and Di-8/16 acetylated peptides, were tested for their ability to be acetylated by human HAT-B; also tested was an H4 NH2-terminal peptide with a deletion of Lys16 (Fig.3). Control experiments verified by immunoprecipitation of the acetylated peptides with site-specific anti-acetylated H4 antibodies (19Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) that HAT-B was acetylating lysines 5 and 12 of the H4 tail (data not presented), consistent with our previous description of human HAT-B activity (19Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Deleting or acetylating Lys16 reduced the ability of HAT-B to acetylate the H4 peptide by ∼50%, and acetylating Lys8 had a slightly greater effect (Fig. 3). The more pronounced effect of Lys16 acetylation on the activity of recombinant Hat1p (Figs. 1 and 2), relative to human HAT-B (Fig. 3), may be due to the presence of the p46 subunit in the human enzyme; it has been demonstrated that the interaction of the H4 tail with yeast Hat1p is stabilized by Hat2p (24Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Notably, as seen earlier with yeast Hat1p, the simultaneous acetylation of Lys8 and Lys16 severely reduced the acetylation of the H4 tail by the human enzyme (Fig. 3). Competition experiments further established that the Lys8/Lys16-diacetylated peptide did not inhibit HAT-B activity, even when present in 10-fold excess over the unacetylated peptide (data not presented). Thus the Lys8/Lys16 peptide is itself a poor Hat1p/HAT-B substrate. Additional experiments were then performed to ensure that acetylation per se was regulating HAT-B activity. For these experiments, a preparation of HDAC was obtained from isolated HeLa cell nuclei (see “Experimental Procedures”). Unacetylated and Lys8/Lys16-diacetylated H4 peptides were then pretreated with HDAC prior to using the peptides in HAT-B assays. Control experiments verified that no contaminating HAT activities from the HDAC extract were present during the subsequent HAT-B reactions. Pretreating the Lys8/Lys16-diacetylated peptide with HDAC enabled HAT-B to acetylate the peptide at lysines 5 and 12, to 75–80% of control levels; buffer alone or BSA had no effect (Fig.4, A and B). Moreover, HDAC activity was essential during pretreatment; adding sodium butyrate to the HDAC reaction to inhibit deacetylases prevented the restoration of full HAT-B activity in the subsequent HAT-B reaction (Fig. 4 B). Thus, acetylation at Lys8/Lys16 is responsible for the reduction in HAT-B activity. The acetylation of specific, nonsubstrate lysine residues (i.e. Lys8 and Lys16) of the histone H4 NH2 terminus reduces the acetylation of lysines 5 and 12 by both yeast and human Hat1 enzymes in vitro. Our results provide strong support for the model of H4-Hat1p interaction proposed by Dutnall et al. (27Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 1998; 94: 427-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Dutnall R.N. Tafrov S.T. Sternglanz R. Ramakrishnan V. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. 1998; 63: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), in which Lys8 and Lys16 are postulated to interact electrostatically with acidic domains within the Hat1p active site. In addition, this is the first demonstration that the activity of any histone acetyltransferase can potentially be regulated by the prior acetylation of nonsubstrate lysine residues within an individual histone tail. Yeast Hat1p exhibits a strong preference for acetylating Lys12 of H4 over Lys5 (24Parthun M.R. Widom J. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 26Kleff S. Andrulis E.D. Anderson C.W. Sternglanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24674-24677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In light of this, it might be expected that acetylation of the Mono-5 peptide (with Lys12 available for modification) would more closely approach that of the unacetylated peptide (Fig. 2). The presence of acetylation on Lys5 may therefore lower the ability of the H4 tail to interact with HAT-B. Notably, it has been shown by Loidl and colleagues (21Kolle D. Sarg B. Lindner H. Loidl P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that maize HAT-B is incapable of using a native mixture of monoacetylated H4 isoforms as a substrate, although in this case the specific lysines inhibiting acetylation were not identified. Thus in that study a significant percentage of input H4 was very likely acetylated on Lys5 or Lys12. It is now becoming clear that histone acetyltransferases may be controlled (either positively or negatively) by posttranslational modifications on residues that neighbor HAT-specific target lysines. For example, it has recently been shown that the Gcn5 histone acetyltransferase strongly prefers phosphorylated over unphosphorylated H3 as a substrate and that prior phosphorylation at serine 10 of H3 can potentiate subsequent acetylation of lysine 14 (33, 34). Moreover, the methylation of H3 at lysine 9 inhibits the phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 (35), and it has been proposed that histone methylation can help to regulate acetylation (and vice versa), at least in some instances (36Rice J.C. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). While our experiments have focused on the activity of Hat1 in vitro, peptide assays have previously been shown to be excellent predictors of the interactions between histone modifications in vivo, as seen with the enhancement of H3 acetylation by phosphorylation (33Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 34Lo W.S. Trievel R.C. Rojas J.R. Duggan L. Hsu J.Y. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 917-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and the inhibition of H3 phosphorylation by prior methylation (35Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll N. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). The positive or negative interaction of histone modifications thus appears to be a general regulatory mechanism of histone metabolism, as detailed in the “histone code” hypothesis proposed by Strahl and Allis (37Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6532) Google Scholar), in which histone modifications act in concert to regulate gene activity. Hat1 is most likely involved in the acetylation of newly synthesized H4, which is not expected to be pre-acetylated at lysines 8 and/or 16. Nevertheless, our results have relevance beyond supporting the proposed model of H4-Hat1 interaction. For example, in human cells a nuclear CAC complex (comprising the chromatin assembly factor CAF-1 and histones H3 and H4) has been described, in which a fraction of H4 is acetylated at Lys8, as well as at Lys5 and Lys12 (38Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Cell. 1996; 87: 95-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The CAC complex thus appears to represent a chromatin-bound intermediate in the deposition of new H4 onto chromatin, isolated prior to the deacetylation of nascent H4. Our results now suggest that the acetylation of new H4 at Lys8should follow the acetylation of Lys5 and Lys12by HAT-B, since prior acetylation of Lys8 could inhibit the activity of human HAT-B. Although Hat1 is typically recovered from cytosolic extracts, there is evidence that the great majority of the human Hat1 is nuclear in vivo (20Verreault A. Kaufman P.D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 96-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Nuclear as well as cytoplasmic HAT-B type enzymes have also been described in Tetrahymena cells (23Richman R. Chicoine L.G. Collini C.M.P. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and maize embryos (39Lusser A. Eberharter A. Loidl A. Goralik-Schramel M. Horngacher M. Haas H. Loidl P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4427-4435Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Hat1 in Xenopus oocytes has been demonstrated to shuttle between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (22Imhof A. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13085-13093Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and in yeast, Hat1p is found in two separate complexes, at least one of which is nuclear (25Ruiz-Garcia A.B. Sendra R. Galiana M. Pamblanco M. Perezortin J.E. Tordera V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12599-12605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the activity of HAT enzymes can be modulated by their association with other proteins within HAT-containing complexes (reviewed in Ref.40Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar), and it remains to be seen whether the Hat1 catalytic subunit can in some circumstances associate with proteins that expand its specificity to include nucleosomal histones in vivo. If so, pre-existing acetylation patterns could also help to regulate nuclear Hat1 complexes that engage chromatin-bound substrates."

When CopZ was overexpressed from a plasmid, the cells exhibited increased sensitivity to copper and oxidative stress, suggesting that high CopZ expression could become toxic to cells. In wild-type cells, the level of mRNA transcripts from the cop operon remained high in up to 5 mm copper, suggesting that CopZ was proteolyzed. Cell extracts were found to contain a copper-activated proteolytic activity that degraded CopZ in vitro. In this assay, Cu-CopZ was more susceptible to degradation than apo-CopZ.

Hazegh Azam M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63: S797-S811PubMed Google Scholar). The two oxidation states of copper, copper(I) and copper(II), not only allow its participation in essential redox reactions but can also form reactive oxygen species that cause cellular damage. Hence, the maintenance of copper homeostasis by controlling uptake, accumulation, detoxification, and removal of copper is critical to living organisms. Many proteins involved in copper homeostasis have thus far been identified in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (for review see Refs.2Camakaris J. Voskoboinik I. Mercer J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 3Pena M.M. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 4Horn N. Tümer Z. J.

In the Gram-positive bacteria, Enterococcus hirae, copper homeostasis has been extensively studied and is known in some detail. The regulation of intracellular copper levels under the stress conditions of copper depletion as well as copper overload is achieved by the cop operon. The operon encodes four proteins: 2 copper ATPases (CopA and CopB), 1 repressor (CopY), and 1 metallochaperone (CopZ) (6Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

CopA and CopB are transmembranous ATPases, which appear to be responsible for transporting copper ions into and out of the cell, respectively (8Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol.

Expression of the cop operon is induced by copper (7Odermatt A. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This regulation is accomplished by the CopY repressor, which also regulates its own expression. Under normal growth conditions in complex media, expression of the cop operon is repressed by the binding of CopY to the promoter (16Strausak D. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8932-8936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Wunderli-Ye H. Solioz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If copper levels are increased, the Zn2+ cofactor of CopY is replaced by two Cu+ ions, thereby releasing CopY from the promoter and allowing transcription to proceed (18Cobine P. Wickramasinghe W.A. Harrison M.D. Weber T. Solioz M. Dameron C.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The Cu+ ions are delivered to CopY by the CopZ copper chaperone, a member of a family of metallochaperones that are conserved from bacteria to man. These proteins are ∼70 amino acids in length and feature a copper(I) binding site involving an exposed CXX C motif (19Wimmer R. Herrmann T. Solioz M. Wüthrich K. J. Biol.

It was observed that CopZ of E. hirae is more labile under high copper stress. 1Lu and Solioz, unpublished observations. In a number of systems, proteolysis provides cells with an additional means to modulate protein levels in response to changes in cellular physiology and external stress. However, these processes have not been studied as extensively as transcriptional and translational regulation, particularly in regard to copper (for review see Refs. 23Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 592-621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 24Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 465-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Copper-induced degradation of the copper transporter Ctr1p ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae has been described previously (25Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The yeast transcription factor Mac1, which is involved in high affinity copper uptake, is also degraded under high copper concentrations (26Zhu Z. Labbe S. Pena M.M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1277-1280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Conversely, in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, apo-plastocyanin, a copper-binding protein that catalyzes electron transfer during photosynthesis, is rapidly degraded under copper-deficient conditions. This presumably serves to ensure that copper is available to indispensable cuproenzymes (27Li H.H. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23504-23510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the proteases involved in these processes have not been identified or characterized in biochemical terms. In this study, we examined the expression and stability of the CopZ protein and assessed mRNA levels under varying copper conditions. At high copper concentrations, increased proteolysis of CopZ was observed, whereas mRNA levels were maintained. If proteolysis of CopZ was saturated by overexpression, toxic effects ensued. Our results show that copper-activated proteolysis is an additional mechanism ofE. hirae to fine-tune the response to copper. Wild-type E. hirae (ATCC9790) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The copZ null mutant of this strain and its complementation with a CopZ-overexpressing plasmid, pCC6, were described previously (7Odermatt A. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Logarithmically growing cells, frozen in 17% glycerol at −70 °C, were used to inoculate cultures in all growth experiments. The growth response of cells to different agents was monitored in N-media (1% Na2HPO4.2H2O, 1% trypticase peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% glucose) in 1-ml cultures in capped cuvettes. The cultures were inoculated with 1/50 volume of frozen log cells and grown at 37 °C for 1 h before the addition of the additive. Growth was followed by measuring theA 546 with a Lambda 16 Spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Chemicals for growth media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cultures in 5 ml ofN-media were grown to an A 546 of 0.4–0.6 followed by induction with different CuSO4concentrations for 90 min. Cell lysates were prepared by centrifuging 2-ml aliquots and treating the cell pellets with 50 μl of 10 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, at room temperature for 10 min. After a freeze-thaw cycle, the lysates were treated with 10 μl of DNase I in 100 mmMgCl2 for 5 min at room temperature. Proteins were finally denatured in SDS sample buffer at 37 °C for 10 min. Amounts of extracts corresponding to the same number of cells were resolved by tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (28Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Western blots were prepared as described previously (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against CopZ and a horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Pierce). Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and following the instructions of the manufacturer. Chemiluminescent signals were captured and quantified with the Fuji LAS-1000 imaging system (Fuji Photo Film Tokyo, Japan). The overexpression of CopZ was accomplished in a ΔcopZ strain-harboring plasmid pCC6 as described previously (7Odermatt A. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Frozen log cells were grown to mid-log phase (A 546 = 0.7) followed by induction for 75 min with the CuSO4concentrations specified in the experiment. A 1-ml aliquot of each culture was then harvested and dried for 1 h at 120 °C to determine the dry weight. Another 1-ml aliquot was washed three times with 50 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, resuspended in 1 ml 10% perchloric acid, 10% nitric acid, and hydrolyzed at 98 °C for 30 min, and the copper content was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy on a Perkin-Elmer 2380 instrument. Wild-type E. hirae cells were grown to an A 546 of 0.4–0.6 inN-media followed by induction with the respective CuSO4 concentration for 90 min. From 6 × 108 of these cells, mRNA was isolated with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Hilden, Germany). Contaminating DNA was removed by incubating the RNA samples (50 μl) with DNaseI reaction buffer (10 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 units of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 unit of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped with 25 μl of DNase I stop mix (50 mm EDTA, 1.5 m sodium acetate, 1% SDS). RNA samples were then cleaned a second time with the RNeasy kit. Concentration and integrity of RNA samples were checked on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels. To look at variations in mRNA levels at high copper concentrations over time, wild-type E. hirae was grown to an A 546 of 0.4–0.6 inN-media containing 0.25 mm CuSO4(preinduction), followed by growth in 5 mm copper for the indicated times. Reverse transcription of 250 ng of RNA was conducted with the SuperScript Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the random hexamers supplied with this kit, according to the protocol of the manufacturer. A control without reverse transcriptase was run for each sample. To verify the absence of DNA contamination, reverse transcription products (2 μl) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)2 using the primers 5′-GTGTGGCTCGGATTGAAGAAG and 5′-GGTCCATGACTTCCAAGCATC, designed to amplify a 521-base pair region encompassing the 3′ end ofcopZ and the beginning of copA. Thermal cycling was performed as follows: 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 59 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 60 s. The PCR mixtures consisted of 2 μl of 50-fold diluted reverse transciption product prepared as described above and 18 μl of reaction mixture (1 μmeach of the primers described above, 4 mmMgCl2, 2 μl of master mix (FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Primers for the internal control (5′-AGGGTCATTGGAAACTGGGAG and 5′-CTGGTAAGGTTCTTCGCGTTG) were designed based on the 16 S rRNA of E. hirae (ATCC8043) (GenBankTM accession number AF061011) and amplified a 359-base pair region. Reactions were run in a LightCycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) under the following conditions: hot start denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min; 52 cycles of amplification with 95 °C for 15 s, 59 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. Melting curve analysis was conducted by heating to 95 °C followed by 65 °C for 15 s. Fluorescence was then continuously measured from 65–95 °C followed by final cooling to 40 °C for 30 s. Levels of the cop operon RNA transcription were corrected for variations of the internal control. CopZ was purified as described previously (19Wimmer R. Herrmann T. Solioz M. Wüthrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22597-22603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Degradation was measured at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 80 ng of CopZ and 20 μg of crude cell lysate of a ΔcopZ mutant. Other additions were as detailed under “Results.” Degradation was assessed by Western blotting and quantitative chemiluminescent measurements as detailed above. Lysates were prepared as described under “CopZ expression and Western Blotting” but without the addition of SDS sample buffer. Where required, cells were induced with 3 mmCuSO4, the copper chelators bicinchoninic acid (0.1 mm), or o- phenanthroline (0.25 mm) for 1 h. Zymography was conducted essentially as described previously (30Leber T.M. Balkwill F.R. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). 7.5% SDS gels were copolymerized with 130 μg/ml purified CopZ or bovine serum albumin. Crude lysates (50 μg) from uninduced wild-type E. hirae and from cells induced with 3 mm copper were resolved electrophoretically. Gels were then soaked in 2.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h followed by the proteolytic reaction overnight at 37 °C in 50 mmK-HEPES, pH 7.0, 2% acetonitrile. Gels were rinsed with distilled H20 and proteolytic clearing zones visualized by staining in 0.01% Coomassie Blue, 7.5% acetic acid, 10% ethanol at room temperature for 105 min. It has previously been shown that the growth of wild-type E. hirae is not significantly affected by up to 5 mmcopper in the growth media (31Odermatt A. Krapf R. Solioz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This copper resistance is accomplished by the induction of the CopB copper exporting ATPase encoded by thecop operon. The expression of CopB (and also CopA) increases with rising copper concentrations up to a maximum at 2 mm copper (31Odermatt A. Krapf R. Solioz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here we observed that the expression of the CopZ copper chaperone encoded by the same polycistronic message as CopA and CopB only increased up to 0.5 mm copper and declined again at higher copper concentrations to become nearly undetectable at 3 mm copper (Fig.1 A). The disappearance of CopZ under high copper conditions raised two questions: 1) is CopZ damaging to cells under high copper conditions, and 2) does down-regulation proceed via control of transcription, translation, or degradation? The question of possible toxic effects of high levels of CopZ under high copper conditions was addressed with a strain strongly overexpressing CopZ from plasmid pCC6 in a ΔcopZ background. Even when not induced by copper, these cells showed strong CopZ expression, and expression was further induced by copper (Fig.1 B). At all copper concentrations employed, expression levels were 10–20 times higher in the CopZ-overexpressing strain compared with wild-type E. hirae as assessed by quantitative evaluation of chemiluminescence on Western blots. Overexpression of CopZ led to copper sensitivity. Growth of the CopZ-overexpressing strain was inhibited by ambient copper in excess of 0.1 mm and virtually ceased to grow in 1.5 mmcopper (doubling time = 10 h, Fig.2 A). In contrast, the doubling time of the wild-type and the ΔcopZ parent strains were not affected by these copper concentrations. All three strains were normal in terms of the expression of the other three Cop proteins, CopA, CopB, and CopY. Thus, it appeared that CopZ overexpression was toxic to cells. Total cellular copper increased with rising ambient copper (Fig. 2 B). Although a significant portion of this copper was bound to the cell wall, at least a part of the increase can be ascribed to an increase in cytoplasmic copper. This is supported by the observation that cells devoid of the CopB ATPase, the chief copper export route, accumulate considerable larger amounts of copper than cells expressing CopB (31Odermatt A. Krapf R. Solioz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CopZ overexpression also made the cells more sensitive to H2O2 and paraquat (Fig.3), although these effects were not as marked as the sensitivity to copper. Taken together, these findings suggest that the combination of increased cytoplasmic copper and high CopZ levels induced artificially here are detrimental to the cell. This would provide a rationale for the efficient down-regulation of CopZ in wild-type under high copper conditions.Figure 3Effect of CopZ overexpression on sensitivity to oxidative stress. Cells were grown in 1-ml cuvettes containingN-media with increasing concentrations of either H2O2 (A) or paraquat (B), and growth was monitored by following the A 546. Growth rates were determined as 1/doubling time. ●, E. hirae wild-type; ○, ΔcopZ mutant; ▾,ΔcopZ mutant complemented with a pCC6 plasmid bearing thecopZ gene.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the biphasic expression patterns of CopZ was accompanied by corresponding changes in mRNA levels, cop mRNA was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR. Steady-state levels of cop mRNA were found to rise with increasing copper concentrations, reaching a plateau at 0.25 mm ambient copper (Fig. 4). This level was maintained in up to 5 mm copper. At higher copper concentrations, cop mRNA levels dropped, probably because of the significant growth inhibition under these conditions. When cop mRNA levels were analyzed as a function of time, only a marginal change could be seen over 3 h (Fig. 4,inset). Clearly, the reduced CopZ expression observed under high copper conditions was not the result of decreased steady-state mRNA levels. We thus investigated proteolysis as a mechanism for the disappearance of CopZ at high copper concentration. To this end, the degradative activity of crude cytosolic extracts on purified CopZ was investigatedin vitro. These experiments were carried out under anaerobic conditions to mimic the reducing conditions prevailing inside the cell. A ΔcopZ mutant was used for the preparation of cytosolic extracts to prevent interference from endogenous CopZ. When purified Cu-CopZ was mixed with extract prepared from cells grown in 3 mm copper, it was rapidly degraded (Fig.5 A). apo-CopZ was significantly more resistant to degradation than Cu-CopZ. The half-times of degradation for apo-CopZ and Cu-CopZ were 7 and 22 min, respectively (Fig. 5 B). The 3-fold higher resistance to proteolysis of apo-CopZ compared with Cu-CopZ was unexpected, because copper interacts strongly with two cysteines on CopZ, which would be expected to stabilize the protein structure. This finding points to a mechanism of degradation that specifically favors Cu-CopZ over apo-CopZ. To test whether the observed proteolytic activity was inducible, cytosolic extracts were prepared from cells grown under a variety of conditions: in unsupplemented N-media or inN-media supplemented with 3 mmCuSO4, 0.1 mm copper(I) chelator bicinchoninic acid or 0.25 mm copper(II) chelatoro- phenanthroline. Proteolytic activity was tested onapo-CopZ in the presence and absence of copper. This experiment is complicated by the fact that the different extracts are “contaminated” with either copper or copper chelators. However, it is apparent that the extracts prepared from cells under all growth conditions contained a copper-stimulated proteolytic activity (Fig. 6 A). The inhibition of protein synthesis with chloramphenicol 1 h before the preparation of cell extracts also did not suppress the proteolytic activity (data not shown). For the in vitro proteolysis of CopZ, it made no difference whether copper(I)-acetonitrile or copper(II)-sulfate was added for the incubations of lysates with CopZ, presumably because copper(II) was reduced to copper(I) under the strictly anaerobic conditions of the experiment. Further support for copper(I) being the active species stems from the observation that Ag(I), a potential Cu(I) mimetic, also stimulated proteolysis (data not shown). These results suggest the presence of a constitutive copper(I)-stimulated proteolytic activity in cell extracts. To obtain a handle on the protease acting on CopZ, the susceptibility of the proteolytic activity to protease inhibitors was tested. The two serine protease inhibitors p- phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and p- aminobenzamidine were found to inhibit the degradation of CopZ, whereas TLCK and TPCK, which are also serine protease inhibitors, had no marked effect (Fig. 6 B). Similarly, the metalloproteinase inhibitor o- phenanthroline did not inhibit CopZ degradation. It can thus be concluded that the protease-degrading CopZ is a serine-type protease. Zymography has been widely used to associate enzymatic activities with protein bands on gels. We here used this method to visualize the Cop-protein-degrading activity in crude cell extracts. The zymograms revealed a protease activity of 58 kDa that exhibited the expected properties, namely the activation by copper and inhibition byp- aminobenzamidine (Fig. 7,arrow). Maximal activation of proteolysis was observed at 3 μm copper(I)-acetonitrile. Silver(I) also activated but to a lesser extent (data not shown). This protease did not degrade bovine serum albumin and thus exhibited substrate specificity. The copper-treated samples always displayed fewer protein bands by Coomassie Blue staining. We ascribe this result to aggregation and trapping in the stacking gel of a selected population of proteins by copper. This tentative zymographic identification of the protease could form the basis for its biochemical characterization and the isolation of knock-out strains. Previous studies demonstrated that the cop operon, encoding the four genes CopY, CopZ, CopA, and CopB, is regulated at the transcriptional level by copper (7Odermatt A. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Odermatt A. Krapf R. Solioz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The copper-responsive repressor, CopY, is released from the promoter by increased copper levels, thereby allowing transcription to proceed (17Wunderli-Ye H. Solioz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this work, we report a second mechanism that controls the intracellular concentration of CopZ at the post-translational level, the proteolytic degradation of CopZ under high copper conditions. CopZ was maximally induced at 0.5 mm extracellular copper and was reduced at higher copper concentrations to eventually become undetectable above 3 mm media copper. The involvement of proteolysis under these conditions is supported by several lines of evidence. At a copper concentration of 0.5 mm, CopZ expression and the level of cop mRNA both reached a maximum. Thereafter, cop mRNA transcription remained high, whereas CopZ levels decreased and eventually became undetectable. Because the primers used to measure mRNA levels by real-time quantitative PCR covered the 3′ end of thecopZ gene, it appears improbable that the specific partial degradation of the cop message is the cause for decreased CopZ expression. Rather, CopZ levels are apparently copper-regulated by two distinct mechanisms, regulation at the level of transcription and posttranslational control by proteolysis. The degradation of CopZ could also be demonstrated in vitro using purified CopZ and cell extracts. Zymographic studies revealed a protease with the anticipated properties. The proteolytic degradation of CopZ in wild-type cells grown in high copper not only implies that the chaperone is dispensable under these conditions but suggests that it becomes toxic to the cell. The chief cause or at least a contributing factor to this could be a rise in cytoplasmic copper in cells grown at elevated ambient copper. Increased intracellular copper could result in excessive and thus detrimental Cu-CopZ concentrations. The toxic effects of CopZ overexpression from a plasmid strongly support this notion. Elevated Cu-CopZ levels could compromise the specificity of the intracellular copper delivery process, which would lead to the transfer of copper to unqualified sites. Alternatively, the exposed copper in Cu-CopZ (19Wimmer R. Herrmann T. Solioz M. Wüthrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22597-22603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) could participate in radical formation. In support for the latter mechanism, we observed that the overexpression of CopZ led to increased sensitivity of cells to copper, hydrogen peroxide, and paraquat, a generator of superoxide anions. In light of this, the 3× faster degradation of Cu-CopZ versus apo-CopZ that we observed in our in vitro assay would be biologically meaningful. With priority, the toxic Cu-CopZ has to be removed. The down-regulation of CopZ under high copper conditions would preclude an essential role of this chaperone in the secretion of excess copper, which proceeds by the CopB copper ATPase in E. hirae. Conceivably, copper complexed to glutathione or other biomolecules is the substrate for secretion by CopB. On the other hand, interaction studies using surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that CopZ interacts with the putative copper import ATPase, CopA (32Multhaup G. Strausak D. Bissig K.-D. Solioz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These observations would suggest that CopZ picks up copper from"

Telomeric DNA sequences consist of simple sequences repeated with one strand rich in guanine. For example, the telomeres of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain ∼300 base pairs of double-stranded (TG1–3/C1–3A) sequences. In most of the eukaryotic telomeres, the G-rich strand protrudes as a 3′ overhang. Single-stranded telomeric DNA is capable of forming multimeric structures. It could form G-quartet structures within a single DNA molecule or involving two or four DNA molecules (3Sen D. Gilbert W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 435-438Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Formation of G-quartet structures in vitro requires high DNA concentrations and long incubation time. A G-quartet consists of four guanines arranged in a square-planar array, and each guanine serves as both hydrogen bond acceptor and donor in a Hoogsteen base pair. Successive layers of G-quartets stack on each other to form folded structures (4Aboul-era F. Murchie A.I.H. Lilley D.M.J.

Nevertheless, evidence has been presented to indicate that G-quartet indeed may existin vivo. For instance, both the β-subunit of theOxytricha telomere-binding protein and the Rap1p of S. cerevisiae promote the formation of G-quartet at a very low G-rich DNA concentration in vitro (9Fang G.

Thus, formation of G-quartet in vivo is likely to occur and is supposed to be involved in telomere-telomere interaction. Cdc13p is a single-stranded TG1–3-binding protein that interacts with telomeres in S. cerevisiae (20Lin J.-J. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5600-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It has multiple functions in cells. For example, Cdc13p is involved in cell cycle control since a temperature-sensitive allele of CDC13,cdc13–1, causes cell cycles to arrest in the G2/M phase at nonpermissive temperatures (23Garvik B.

Binding of Cdc13p to telomeres may cause yeast cells to differentiate whether the ends of linear DNA are telomeres or broken ends (24Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Science. 1988; 241: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). In addition, Cdc13p appears to be a key factor in telomere replication (25Evans S.K. Lundblad V. Science. 1999; 286: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 26Qi H. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1777-1788PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pennock E. Buckley K. Lundblad V.

It might also prevent end-to-end fusion of chromosomes and thus protect chromosomes from degradation by nucleases. CDC13 is an essential gene that encodes a 924-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 104,895 Da (23Garvik B. Carson M. Hartwell L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6128-6138Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The Cdc13p fragment ranging from amino acids 451 to 693, Cdc13-(451–693)p, contains the telomere binding region of Cdc13p. This fragment is sufficient to bind single-stranded telomeric DNA in vitro, and it interacts with telomeres in vivo (28Wang M.-J. Lin Y.-C. Pang T.-L. Lee J.-M. Chou C.-C. Lin J.-J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4733-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Lin Y.-C. Hsu C.-L. Shih J.-W. Lin J.-J. J. Biol.

This observation implies that Cdc13p may have a role in vivo in regulating the association of yeast telomeres and the accessibility of telomerase to telomeres. Insect cell line sf21 was used as the host for baculovirus propagation, expression, and purification of Cdc13p. Plasmid pBac6His-CDC13 was constructed by inserting a 3.0-kilobase pair NcoI-SalI fragment ofCDC13 into NcoI- and SalI-digested pBac6His (constructed by J.-J. Lin, modified from pBlueBac4, Invitrogen). This plasmid enabled the expression of Cdc13p with a 6xHis tag at the N terminus. Recombinant virus that express 6xHis-tagged Cdc13p was generated by co-infection of plasmid pBac6His-CDC13 and Bac-N-Blue DNA to sf21 cells (Invitrogen). To purify 6xHis-tagged Cdc13p, ∼5 × 107 sf21 cells were infected with recombinant virus for 4 days. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by adding Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspensions were incubated in ice for 40 min and sonicated. Total cell extracts were then collected by centrifugation. Ni-NTA1-agarose (Qiagen) was used to purify the 6xHis-tagged Cdc13p. The batch purification protocol was used according to the suggestions of the manufacturer. The bound 6xHis-tagged Cdc13p was eluted by buffer containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 250 mm imidazole, and 20% glycerol. Purified protein was aliquoted and frozen by dry ice-ethanol bath. The yield of Cdc13p was ∼0.5 mg/107cells. Escherichia coli DH5α was used as the host for plasmid construction and propagation, and BL21(DE3)pLysS was used as the host for Cdc13-(451–693)p purification. Plasmid pET6H-CDC13(451–693), which was used to purify the Cdc13-(451–693)p, was constructed by inserting the NcoI-NruI fragment of pTHA-NLS-CDC13(451–693) into NcoI-SmaI-digested pET6H (a gift from C.-H. Hu, National Marine University, Taiwan). The resulting plasmid was used to express 6xHis-tagged Cdc13-(451–693)p under the control of the T7 promoter (28Wang M.-J. Lin Y.-C. Pang T.-L. Lee J.-M.

To purify 6xHis-tagged Cdc13-(451–693)p, a 1-liter culture of E. coli harboring pET6H-CDC13(451–693) was grown at 25 °C toA 600 of 0.5 and induced with the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were grown at 25 °C for another 4 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1× protease inhibitors (Calbiochem)) and sonicated to release the cell contents. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain total cell-free extracts. 0.5 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) was added to the total cell-free extracts and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin was washed and eluted with 2 ml of buffer containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 250 mm imidazole, and 20% glycerol. Purified protein was aliquoted and frozen by dry ice-ethanol bath. The yield of Cdc13-(451–693)p was ∼4.2 mg from 1 liter of E. coli culture. Oligonucleotide Sacc1 (5′-ACTGTCGTACTTGATATGTGGGTGTGTGTGGG-3′ (31Venczel E.A. Sen D.

The labeled single-stranded Sacc1 DNA was mixed with an equal volume of 2 m NaCl to give a final concentration of 4 μg/μl Sacc1 DNA in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1m NaCl. Samples were then sealed in a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube using Parafilm and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. The G4 DNA was then purified from a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel after electrophoresis. To perform the assays (29Lin Y.-C. Hsu C.-L. Shih J.-W. Lin J.-J. J. Biol.

The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Then the mixtures were loaded directly on an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was prerun at 125 V for 10 min. Electrophoresis was carried out in TBE (89 mmTris borate, 2 mm EDTA) at 125 V for 105 min. The gels were dried and autoradiographed, and the amounts of oligonucleotides bound to the proteins were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The apparent binding constant of Cdc13p and Cdc13-(451–693)p to DNA substrate was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and quantified by a PhosphorImager.

Labeled single-stranded or G4 Sacc1 DNA was mixed with Cdc13p or Cdc13-(451–693)p in 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Dimethyl sulfate (DMS) was added to a final concentration of 0.05% and incubated at 22 °C for another 15 min.

The gels were dried and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The proteins used in this study, Cdc13p and Cdc13-(451–693)p, were expressed in insect sf21 cells and E. coli, respectively. They contain a six-histidine tag at the N terminus and were purified to homogeneity using a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Fig. 1 A). These two proteins were capable of binding to single-stranded TG1–3 DNA (29Lin Y.-C. Hsu C.-L. Shih J.-W. Lin J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24588-24593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The DNA probe used in this study, Sacc1, has 16 bases of TG1–3at the 3′ end, preceded by 16 bases of nontelomeric DNA. It was shown to be capable of forming intermolecular parallel G-quartet structure in the presence of Na+ (31Venczel E.A. Sen D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6220-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Indeed, a slow migration band was apparent when Sacc1 was incubated in 1 m NaCl at 37 °C for 72 h (Fig. 1 B). In agreement with the previous report (31Venczel E.A. Sen D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6220-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the slow mobility, the heat sensitivity (Fig. 1 B), and the DMS footprint (see Fig. 3) indicated that this band was an intermolecular parallel G-quartet DNA, G4 Sacc1. A model for the structure of G4 Sacc1 is illustrated in Fig. 1 C.Figure 3Partial denaturing of G4 DNA by Cdc13-(451–693)p. G4 Sacc1 was incubated with 1 μmCdc13-(451–693)p at 30 °C for 10 min and subjected to phenol extraction (lanes 4 and 5). The reaction products were then analyzed by gel electrophoresis using an 8% polyacrylamide gel. ss Sacc1, single-stranded Sacc1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether Cdc13p and Cdc13-(451–693)p could bind to G-quartet DNA, the proteins were mixed with single-stranded DNA substrate, and the G4 Sacc1 and the complexes were analyzed. The result, as shown in Fig. 2, demonstrated that both Cdc13p and Cdc13-(451–693)p were capable of forming complexes with single-stranded (Fig. 2 A) and G-quartet DNA (Fig. 2 B). We also determined the binding affinity of Cdc13p and Cdc13-(451–693)p to these DNA substrates. The apparent binding constant was determined from a Hill plot. Compared with Cdc13p, Cdc13-(451–693)p appears to bind this single-stranded telomeric DNA with lower affinity. Both proteins bind to G-quartet DNA with their affinity similar to that of single-stranded DNA (Table I). To investigate whether the binding of Cdc13p and Cdc13-(451–693)p might affect the structure of G-quartet DNA, the protein-G4-DNA complex was deproteinized using phenol extraction, and the resulting DNA products were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, the level of single-stranded Sacc1 was increased upon incubation with Cdc13-(451–693)p. Quantification of the gel indicated that the proportion of the single-stranded Sacc1 within the DNA sample was increased by ∼10% after being incubated with Cdc13-(451–693)p. The result suggested that the G-quartet was partially denatured into single-stranded DNA upon binding of Cdc13p. One of the assays for the presence of G-quartets was to establish whether the N-7 of guanines is utilized for Hoogsteen-type base pairing. The accessibility of the N-7 of guanines therefore was probed using DMS (33Williamson J.R. Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 871-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The methylation protection study was carried out using purified single-stranded DNA and the G4 Sacc1, and the result of the footprint analysis is shown in Fig. 4. In the single-stranded Sacc1 substrate, all guanines are methylated to the same extent indicating that the oligonucleotide is unfolded (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). In contrast, the guanines within the telomeric region of G4 Sacc1 DNA became inaccessible to methylation, although the guanines in the nontelomeric region remained accessible to methylation (Fig. 4, A, lane 3, andB). This result is in agreement with the conclusion that the Sacc1 oligonucleotide folded into a G-quartet structure. To test whether the binding of Cdc13p and Cdc13-(451–693)p would actually affect the structure of G-quartet DNA, the protein-DNA complexes were subjected to DMS footprint analysis. Autoradiograms of the footprints for Cdc13p and Cdc13-(451–693)p complexing with G-quartet DNA are shown in Fig. 4 A, and the tracing of these results is shown in Fig. 4 B. In the presence of Cdc13p or Cdc13-(451–693)p, the methylation pattern of G-quartet DNA was changed. A few telomeric guanines now become accessible to DMS, suggesting that both Cdc13p and Cdc13-(451–693)p partially denature the G-quartet. In vivo studies show that CDC13 is essential for the maintenance of S. cerevisiae telomeres (21Nugent C.I. Hughes T.R. Lue N.F. Lundblad V.

Denaturing of G-quartet structure by Cdc13p could have several biological implications. In S. cerevisiae, telomeres acquire long G-rich tails at late S phase (34Wellinger R.J. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Such a single-stranded tail could contribute to the formation of ring-like DNA structure in linear plasmids bearing a single-stranded TG1–3 tail (34Wellinger R.J. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 35Wellinger R.J. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4057-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Since G-quartet structure is not the substrate of telomerase (36Raghuraman M.K. Cech T.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 37Zahler A.M. Williamson J.R. Cech T.R. Prescott D.M. Nature. 1991; 350: 718-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar) and it is extremely stable once it is formed (6Wang Y. Patel D.J.

Nature. 1990; 344: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), the G-quartet structure therefore has to be disassembled to allow for the extension by telomerase. The participation of Cdc13p in the binding and denaturing of G-quartets may provide a possible means for regulating the accessibility of telomeres by telomerase. Moreover, since G-quartet structure was implicated in the association among telomeres, including pairing between telomeres of sister chromatids (39Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 363-366Crossref Scopus (1425) Google Scholar), Cdc13p may also play a role in the regulation of the organization of telomeres. In any case, binding of G-quartet DNA by a telomere-binding protein implies that such structure is biologically relevant in cells and that Cdc13p may be involved in the maintenance of such structure.

The APC tumor suppressor contributes to chromosome segregation and turnover of the oncogenic transcriptional activator β-catenin, and these activities are impaired by truncating cancer mutations. APC was recently identified as a shuttling protein whose subcellular distribution is regulated by two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and multiple nuclear export signals (NESs). Here, we show that mutant disease-linked truncated forms of APC, most of which lack the two central NLSs and certain NES sequences, retain nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling activity. Nuclear export of truncated APC is mediated by a dominant N-terminal NES. Nuclear import of NLS-deficient APC mutants is facilitated by the N-terminal ARM domain. Furthermore, co-expression of the ARM-binding protein, B56α, increased the nuclear localization of mutant and wild-type APC. The minimal B56α-responsive sequence mapped to APC amino acids 302–625. B56α is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A; however, its ability to shift APC to the nucleus was independent of phosphatase activity. We conclude that APC nuclear import is regulated by the ARM domain through its interaction with B56α and postulate that APC/B56α complexes target the dephosphorylation of specific proteins within the nucleus.

A. 2000; 97: 12085-12090Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), three different NESs were also detected in the central 20-amino acid repeats of APC (14Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). These latter export signals in addition to two nuclear localization signals (NLS) identified in the center of APC (16Zhang F. White R.L. Neufeld K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12577-12582Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) are deleted by most cancer and FAP mutations, prompting the suggestion that APC nuclear transport is impaired in cancer cells (14Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that this is not the case and demonstrate that cancer-mutated forms of APC retain nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling activity. Using assays to compare nuclear transport activity, we show that different truncated APC mutants are still able to exit the nucleus efficiently due to the presence of a dominant N-terminal NES. Moreover, we identified an important role for the N-terminal ARM domain in the nuclear localization of APC, in particular those forms of APC that lack a nuclear localization signal. Of two known ARM-binding proteins, B56α (17Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and ASEF (18Kawasaki Y. Senda T. Ishidate T. Koyama R. Morishita T. Iwayama Y. Higuchi O. Akiyama T. Science. 2000; 289: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), only B56α, a subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), strongly enhanced nuclear accumulation of APC in co-transfected cells. These findings reveal that APC nuclear transport can be modulated by certain APC-binding proteins and suggest a functional link between APC and targeted phosphatase activity in the nucleus. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, human HCT116, and SW480 colon carcinoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and were free of mycoplasma. Leptomycin B (LMB) (supplied by M. Yoshida, Tokyo) was added to a final concentration of 6 ng/ml. MG132 (Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 20 μm. Actinomycin D (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. DNA transfection of cells (typically 1 μg of DNA per 2 ml of medium) was performed with FuGene reagent as directed (Roche), using cells at medium density seeded onto coverslips. Some transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Several double-stranded oligonucleotide sequences were cloned between the BamHI andAge1 restriction sites of pRev(1.4)-GFP to test APC sequences for possible nuclear export activity as recently described in detail (19Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides correspond to the NES protein sequences shown in Fig. 3. The expression vectors that encode full-length APC (pCMV-APC) and the C-terminal truncated APC mutants, pCMV-APC-(1–2644), pCMV-APC-(1–1941), and pCMV-APC-(1–1309), were described previously (20Smith K.J. Levy D.B. Maupin P. Pollard T.D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3672-3675PubMed Google Scholar, 21Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3488) Google Scholar). Additional APC truncation mutants (1–932, 1–625, and 1–302) were constructed in pCMV-APC by first removing the KpnI/XhoI fragment and replacing it with PCR-amplified fragments that introduce published FAP mutations (22Miyoshi Y. Ando H. Nagase H. Nishisho I. Horii A. Miki Y. Mori T. Utsunomiya J. Baba S. Petersen G. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nakamura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4452-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and premature stop codons into the APC sequence. For PCR, a common forward primer was used (5′-TGGAATATGAAGCAA-3′), and theXhoI site-containing reverse primers were as follows: mutant (1), 5′-TCCGCTCGAGTAAGTGTTTAATGTGTATGG-3′; mutant (1), 5′-TCCGCTCGAGTGTTTGTCTGCTCCGGTAAG-3′; and mutant (1), 5′-TCCGCTCGAGTTGTCAGCCTTCAGGTGCAG-3′. The full-length APC cDNA containing site-directed mutations in NES1 or NES1+2 were described previously (12Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and the same NES1 mutation (L75A/L77A) was inserted into the APC deletion constructs APC-(1–302) and APC-(1–625) by replacing the SalI/KpnI fragment (N terminus of APC including start site and NESs). A series of FLAG-tagged APC vectors were constructed in which the N-terminal amino acids 1–334 were removed. pCMV-FLAG-APC-(334–2843) was made by first removing the N-terminalBamHI/NheI fragment from pCMV-APC and then inserting a BamHI/NheI-digested DNA fragment containing a new start site and the FLAG epitope in-frame with the adjoining APC sequence (starting at codon 334). C-terminal deletions were then introduced into the pCMV-FLAG-APC-(334–2843) vector by transposing the NheI/XhoI fragments from pCMV-APC-(1–1309), APC-(1–932), and APC-(1–625) described above. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The assay used to assess nuclear export activity was described recently in detail (19Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The assay is based on scoring the cellular distribution of GFP fusion proteins expressed following transfection into cells. The reference vector (pRev(1.4)-GFP) contains an export-deficient form of Rev-GFP, which retains a nuclear localization signal and therefore accumulates in the nucleus/nucleolus of cells. The ability to block nuclear import (with actinomycin D) or export (with leptomycin B) allows for accurate comparison of the export activity of test NESs inserted into the control vector. SW480 cells were separated into nuclear, cytoplasmic, and membrane fractions using the NE-PER kit (Pierce) as directed. Equivalent proportions of each cell fraction (60 μg of cytoplasm, 20 μg of nuclear extract) were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The filter was probed with APC monoclonal antibodies Ab1 and Ab7 (Oncogene Research), β-catenin antibody mAb C19220 (Transduction Laboratory), and a topoisomerase II antibody Ab1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) as a fractionation control. APC was detected at the expected size (∼150-kDa band) as confirmed by size markers. Filters were developed with an ECL chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) exposed to x-ray film and quantitated by densitometry. Cells were fixed and stained with various primary antibodies as described (12Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Samples were then incubated with a secondary antibody (1:120 dilution of a fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody from Sigma) prior to mounting on slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, CA), and fluorescence microscopy. Cells were photographed with an Olympus fluorescence microscope at × 400 magnification, or digital images were captured using an OptiScan confocal microscope at × 600 magnification. For quantitation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence intensities, more than 100 confocal cell images were analyzed using the NIH Image software as previously described (12Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The shuttling of APC between nucleus and cytoplasm is likely to result from the combined action of multiple nuclear import and export signals (Fig.1 A). We therefore compared the subcellular distribution of different APC truncation peptides that result from frequent germline mutations associated with FAP (22Miyoshi Y. Ando H. Nagase H. Nishisho I. Horii A. Miki Y. Mori T. Utsunomiya J. Baba S. Petersen G. Hamilton S.R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nakamura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4055-4057PubMed Google Scholar) or from somatic mutations observed in colon tumors (24Powell S.M. Zilz N. Beazer-Barclay Y. Bryan T.M. Mailton S.R. Thibodeau S.N. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Nature. 1992; 359: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar, 25Miyoshi Y. Nagase H. Ando H. Ichii S. Nakatsura S. Aoki T. Miki Y. Mori T. Nakamura Y. Hum. Mol. Gen. 1992; 1: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar) (see Fig.1 A). APC constructs were transfected into HCT116 (APCwt/wt) and SW480 (APCmut/mut) colon tumor cells, and APC localization was analyzed by immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy. All forms of APC showed some nuclear staining in 20–50% of transfected cells. Interestingly, many of the deletion mutants were more nuclear in SW480 cells than in HCT116 cells, and it is not yet clear if this may relate to differences in the endogenous form of APC expressed by these cell lines. In SW480 cells, the APC-(1–1309) mutant displayed the strongest cytoplasmic staining, at a level comparable with that seen previously (12Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). We recently reported an increase in the nuclear staining of wild-type APC, and of the mutant APC (1–1309), following treatment with the CRM1-specific export inhibitor, leptomycin B (12Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found that all C-terminal truncated forms of APC displayed a similar LMB-responsive shift toward the nucleus in transfected cells (nuclear in 70–80% of LMB-treated cells) (Fig. 1 A). This suggests that disease-associated forms of APC retain the ability to enter and exit the nucleus. In particular, the APC-(1–1941) and APC-(1–1309) mutants displayed an equivalent shift to the nucleus after 4 h of LMB treatment. Unlike the APC-(1–1941) peptide, mutant APC-(1–1309) does not contain the central 20-amino acid repeat NESs (R3, R4, and R7) reported by Rosin-Arbesfeld et al. (14Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), suggesting that deletion of this central region does not impair nuclear export activity. An LMB response was observed even for the shortest N-terminal fragment, APC-(1–302) (Fig. 1, A and B), although the strong nuclear staining of this fragment may reflect passive diffusion through the nuclear pores. In concordance with the above data, a full-length APC NES1+2 mutant (12Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) was more nuclear than wild-type APC in transfected cells, but nuclear staining of the APC NES1+2 mutant was not significantly enhanced by LMB treatment (Fig. 1, A andB). In both colon tumor cell lines tested, full-length APC shifted less well to the nucleus than did APC mutants when export was blocked (Fig. 1), and this may be due in part to cytoplasmic retention caused by C-terminal microtubule binding sequences (20Smith K.J. Levy D.B. Maupin P. Pollard T.D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3672-3675PubMed Google Scholar). We conclude that the N-terminal nuclear export sequences, common to all of the mutants tested, are primarily responsible for CRM1-dependent nuclear export of APC. To exclude the possibility that the transient expression assay data may not reflect the physiological trafficking of cellular APC, we examined the localization and shuttling of endogenous truncated APC-(1–1337) in SW480 cells. Immunofluorescence staining of cellular APC in these cells was inconclusive, largely because of the poor expression of the APC mutant protein. We therefore prepared fractionated extracts from SW480 cells and compared them by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2, APC appeared as the expected ∼150-kDa band predominantly in the cytoplasm. This result concurs with that previously described by Smith et al. (26Smith K.J. Johnson K.A. Bryan T.M. Hill D.E. Markowitz S. Willson J.K.V. Paraskeva C. Petersen G.M. Hamilton S.R. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2846-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and quantitative densitometry of the bands revealed an 18-fold higher level of APC in cytoplasm compared with nucleus. The truncated APC shifted to the nucleus after a 4-h LMB treatment, redistributing to roughly equivalent levels between nucleus and cytoplasm (cytoplasm/nucleus ratio = 1.3) (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained with antibodies Ab1 and Ab7 (Oncogene Research), and they correlated extremely well with the localization of the APC-(1–1309) mutant construct in transfected SW480 cells (Fig.1 A). These findings contradict the claim of Rosin-Arbesfeldet al. (14Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) that APC is predominantly nuclear in SW480 cells and instead demonstrate that the endogenous mutated form of APC is an active nuclear shuttling protein. The above findings question the relative contribution of the APC central repeat NESs. We therefore utilized a sensitive in vivo transport assay (19Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) to compare the individual export activities of the N-terminal NES1 and NES2 sequences (12Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 13Neufeld K.L. Nix D.A. Bogerd H. Kang Y. Beckerle M.C. Cullen B.R. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12085-12090Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and the R3, R4, and R7 NESs (14Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the two N-terminal NESs exhibited a similar level of activity (NES1, a maximal activity of 9+; NES2, a modest activity of 2+) in transfected SW480 colon cancer cells as was previously observed in other cell lines (12Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). While the three APC 20-amino acid repeat sequences (R3, R4, and R7) also displayed some export activity (Fig. 3), even the strongest of these sequences (R3 motif) was weak by comparison to NES1 (see Fig. 3; and Table I for distribution profiles of each construct). Similar results were observed in NM39 melanoma cells (data not shown). The export activities observed were negated (NES1; 91% nuclear) or reduced (R3; 66% nuclear) by a 3-h leptomycin B treatment, consistent with export by the CRM1-dependent transport pathway (27Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Values shown represent the mean ± standard error from at least two independent experiments. More than 300 transfected SW480 cells were scored for each sample. The data reveal that each APC mutant form is regulated by NES1-dependent nuclear export. Our finding of a dominant N-terminal NES explains the shared ability of different APC mutants to exit the nucleus. However, the pathway by which these proteins enter the nucleus is not clear, given that APC cancer mutants usually lack the two C-terminal NLSs reported by Zhanget al. (16Zhang F. White R.L. Neufeld K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12577-12582Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Most APC mutants contain the seven Armadillo-like repeats known as the ARM domain (3van Es J.H. Giles R.H. Clevers H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 28Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), or at least part of this region, which spans residues 453–767 (28Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The large ARM domain of β-catenin was previously implicated in nuclear import (29Funayama N. Fagotto F. McCrea P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We therefore compared the subcellular localization of various ARM-containing APC fragments that lack the first 334 amino acids, in order to test for nuclear import without interference from the N-terminal oligomerization domain (30Joslyn G. Richardson D.S. White R. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11109-11113Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31Su L-K. Johnson K.A. Smith K.J. Hill D.E. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2728-2731PubMed Google Scholar) and export signals. As shown in Fig. 4, deletion of the two central NLSs did not affect nuclear localization. Progressive deletion of the C terminus revealed that short fragments containing only the ARM domain or part of the ARM domain (334) displayed nuclear staining in 40–66% of transfected SW480 cells (Fig. 4). The largest APC subfragment (334–2843) contains the central 20-amino acid repeat export signals and was the only sequence to show an LMB response (data not shown). It is interesting that these weaker NESs are only active in subfragments of APC (Fig. 1 and data not shown). In summary, our results indicate that the ARM sequence can contribute to the nuclear transport and localization of APC. Two APC-binding proteins, ASEF (18Kawasaki Y. Senda T. Ishidate T. Koyama R. Morishita T. Iwayama Y. Higuchi O. Akiyama T. Science. 2000; 289: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and B56α (17Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), have been reported to associate with the N-terminal ARM region of APC and were therefore tested for their ability to promote APC nuclear import. ASEF, a Rac1 GTPase exchange factor (18Kawasaki Y. Senda T. Ishidate T. Koyama R. Morishita T. Iwayama Y. Higuchi O. Akiyama T. Science. 2000; 289: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), was co-expressed with wild-type APC but only modestly improved APC nuclear staining in transfected NIH 3T3 cells (see Fig.5, A and B). In contrast, the ARM-binding protein B56α, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (17Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), increased by >40% the proportion of cells with nuclear APC (Fig. 5). B56α also stimulated nuclear relocalization of the mutant APC-(1–1309) in transfected NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 5 C) and SW480 cells (data not shown), revealing that regulation by this protein is independent of the two central NLSs in APC. Furthermore, when co-expressed with different APC fragments, B56α only enhanced the nuclear localization of sequences that contain the ARM domain (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the smallest B56-responsive sequence mapped here (amino acids 334–625) comprises just the first half of the ARM repeat region, equivalent to the first four armadillo repeats (28Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). This finding significantly refines the APC sequence to which B56α can bind. Several of the B56α-regulated APC sequences that we tested contain no CRM1-dependent nuclear export signals, indicating that B56α does not function simply by blocking APC nuclear export.Figure 6Mapping the minimal B56α-responsive sequence in APC.A, different APC sequences were tested for B56α-dependent nuclear localization. APC constructs were transfected alone or with pHA-B56α into NIH 3T3 cells and scored for nuclear staining by fluorescence microscopy. As indicated, the minimal B56-responsive sequence comprised amino acids 334–625, which contained the first four ARM repeats. B, the proportion of cells showing at least partial nuclear APC staining is graphed as the means ± S.E. from two experiments. The relative increase in nuclear staining is summarized in the top right panel: +, 10–15% increase; ++, 15–30% increase; +++, 30–50% increase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The APC-B56α interaction was previously implicated in down-regulation of β-catenin (17Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), by a mechanism thought to involve the B56α-dependent dephosphorylation and activation of the kinase GSK-3β (17Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether B56α-dependent modulation of APC nuclear localization required its phosphatase activity and/or was an indirect consequence of its activation of GSK-3β. When overexpressed with APC, ectopic GSK-3β induced only a modest increase in nuclear localization (TableIII), comparable with that elicited by ASEF (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the effect of B56α on nuclear localization of APC (1–1309) was not at all perturbed (and in fact increased slightly) by an 18-h treatment with the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor, okadaic acid (Table III). The effectiveness of the drug was confirmed by its ability to induce p21 expression as previously reported (Ref. 32Yan Y. Mumby M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31917-31924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar and data not shown).

Open table in a new tab pCMV-APC-(1–1309) was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells, alone or with pHA-B56α or pHA-GSK-3β. After 48 h, cells were immunostained for APC and the HA tag of each co-factor (as in Fig. 5), and the localization pattern of APC was determined by fluorescence microscopy. Okadaic acid (Sigma) was made up fresh and added to cells 18 h prior to harvest, at a final concentration of 20 nm as previously reported (17Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R.

The APC tumor suppressor interacts with several proteins of diverse function; however, the influence of APC binding partners on its subcellular localization has not been investigated. Recently, we and others showed that APC can shuttle in and out of the nucleus, and multiple transport signals were identified that contribute to APC nuclear import (16Zhang F. White R.L. Neufeld K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12577-12582Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and export (12Henderson B.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 13Neufeld K.L. Nix D.A. Bogerd H. Kang Y. Beckerle M.C. Cullen B.R. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several of these are deleted in colon cancer, prompting earlier speculation that APC nuclear transport is impaired in cancer cells (14Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Here, we show in fact that endogenous and transiently expressed APC cancer mutants retain the ability to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. We report the first quantitative comparison of multiple nuclear export signals from the same protein, revealing that the strongest APC export signal (NES1) is located near the N terminus, thereby explaining why different APC truncation mutants can exit the nucleus. More important, we found that the N-terminal ARM repeat domain facilitates APC nuclear import and that ARM-mediated transport was stimulated by association with B56α, a subunit of PP2A. These findings provide important clarification of the functional role of different APC transport signals and identify the ARM domain as a new transport element in APC. Our findings do not support the recent proposal that APC nuclear export is abolished by C-terminal truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region (MCR) (14Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We compared the same NESs tested by Rosin-Arbesfeldet al. (14Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and found that they exhibit only a modest activity relative to the N-terminal NES1 (Fig. 3), and their deletion did not impair APC nuclear export activity. Importantly, our cell fractionation and Western blot data show that endogenous mutant APC-(1–1337) is mostly cytoplasmic in SW480 cells but shifts to the nucleus when nuclear export is blocked. The concordance between transfection data and experiments with the endogenous cellular APC demonstrate that disease-associated APC mutants retain nuclear shuttling activity, although it is important to note that the functional consequences of their shuttling remain to be determined. The ability of the human APC armadillo repeat region (known as the ARM domain and spanning amino acids 453–767) to mediate nuclear localization is consistent with the previous observation that theDrosophila e-APC ARM sequence displayed nuclear staining when fused to the green fluorescent protein (14Rosin-Arbesfeld R. Townsley F. Bienz M. Nature. 2000; 406: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). By testing for a possible “piggy-back” mechanism of import, we identified the ARM-binding protein B56α as a nuclear import chaperone of APC. Our data do not exclude the possibility, however, that the seven ARM repeats of APC can independently promote nuclear import by directly associating with the nuclear pore complex, as was previously suggested for the much larger ARM repeat domain of β-catenin (29Funayama N. Fagotto F. McCrea P. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 33Fagotto F. Gluck U. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). B56α is a regulatory subunit of PP2A (34McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and was previously claimed to target phosphatase activity to the cytoplasm (34McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that ectopic B56α localized to the nucleus in ∼85% of transfected 3T3 cells (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Unlike its effect on β-catenin stability (17Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), B56α-mediated nuclear localization of APC was unaffected by the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, and thus is unlikely to result from the dephosphorylation of APC or associated proteins. Also, while it is possible that B56α can reduce APC nuclear export, this does not account for its chaperone effect on NES-deficient APC fragments. We therefore propose that B56α functions as an APC chaperone to enhance the nuclear import or retention of APC. We mapped the B56-responsive sequence to the first four ARM repeats of APC, and showed that a sequence lacking ARM repeats was not regulated by B56α (Fig. 6). Furthermore, whereas co-transfection of APC and B56α strongly shifted the distribution of APC toward the nucleus, the B56α-staining pattern was unaffected (data not shown). These observations, when considered together, are consistent with B56α binding to the APC ARM domain and carrying APC into the nucleus. Specific nuclear functions of APC have not yet been identified. We speculate that APC/B56α complexes direct the PP2A heterotrimer to dephosphorylate certain proteins in the nucleus. PP2A regulates a diverse range of cellular processes including cell cycle progression, chromosome segregation, transcription factor activity, apoptosis, and nucleotide excision repair of DNA (35Janssens V.

APC has known involvement in some of these processes, due to its C-terminal interaction with DNA (11Deka J. Herter P. Sprenger-Haussels M. Koosh S. Franz D. Muller K-M. Kuhnen C. Hoffman I. Muller O.

This essential event in the viral life cycle is termed integration and is a multistep process (for reviews see Refs. 1Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Integration. Retroviruses.

The latter step is referred to as either strand transfer or 3′-end joining (7Bushman F.D. Fujiwara T. Craigie R. Science. 1990; 249: 1555-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8Craigie R.

The completion of the integration process consists of the single-stranded gap repair at the site of concerted insertion followed by the joining of the 5′-viral ends to the target DNA. Retroviral integration results in the formation of a provirus flanked by a short direct repeat of cellular DNA.Integration can occur into most sites of the chromosome (11Withers-Ward E.S. Kitamura Y.

However, certain sites within a genome can be used at a frequency several hundred-fold greater than chance (11Withers-Ward E.S. Kitamura Y. Barnes J.P. Coffin J.M.

This finding suggests that there are hot and cold spots for the insertion of retroviral DNA and that integration is not a random process (16Craigie R.

A great amount of effort and the use of sensitive PCR1 assays have only identified a weak consensus sequence for HIV-1 integration (17Bor Y.-C. Miller M.D. Bushman F.D. Orgel L.E.

However, various other factors are known to have a more important impact on target site selection than DNA sequence (21Bor Y.-C. Bushman F.D. Orgel L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A compilation of many studies confirms that a distortion of the target DNA provides attractive sites to the integration machinery (for review, see Ref.27Holmes-Son M.L. Appa R.S. Chow S.A. Adv. Genet. 2001; 43: 33-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Widened major or minor grooves resulting from protein binding or DNA modifications are more frequently chosen for integration over the same sites in linear or unmodified B-form DNA. Although features of target DNA are influential on target site selection, integrase itself has a significant role in determining the DNA site for integration. In vitro, integrases from different retroviruses each display a distinct and unique choice of integration sites when given an identical target DNA (14Pryciak P.M. Muller H.P. Varmus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9237-9241Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Bushman F.D. Wang B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Katzman M. Sudol M. J.

Therefore, a target site determinant exists within integrase.Mutational analysis and proteolysis studies on integrase have identified three discrete functional domains: an N terminus containing a zinc-binding domain, a central catalytic core domain, and a C terminus (31Engelman A. Bushman F.D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The core domain contains the three catalytic residues that comprise the DD(35)E motif, a highly conserved arrangement of active site amino acids among the superfamily of polynucleotidyl transferases (32Fayet O. Ramond P. Polard P. Prère M.F. Chandler M. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1771-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 33Kulkosky J. Jones K.S. Katz R.A. Mack J.P.G. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell.

Although some of their properties have been elucidated, the exact roles of the terminal domains are presently not well established. The N terminus is able to chelate zinc, which promotes the multimerization of integrase and increases its catalytic activity (36Burke C.J. Sanyal G. Bruner M.W. Ryan J.A. LaFemina R.L. Robbins H.L.

A. 1996; 93: 13659-13664Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The N terminus may also be necessary to specifically recognize and bind viral DNA (41Katzman M. Sudol M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1744-1753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42van den Ent F.M.I. Vos A. Plasterk R.H.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Chow S.A.

Because it has been difficult to obtain an x-ray crystallographic structure of full-length integrase due to its poor solubility and tendency to aggregate, the interactions between integrase and viral or target DNA have not been fully delineated.Despite the incomplete understanding of integrase, the available data on the function and structure of retroviral integrases allow us to use a chimeric integrase strategy to study its role in target site preference. Both HIV-1 and FIV integrases have similar biochemical properties and share 37% amino acid identity (see Fig. 1) but have different integration preferences when using an identical target DNA (30Shibagaki Y. Chow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8361-8369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 50Shibagaki Y. Holmes M.L. Appa R.S. Chow S.A.

Therefore, swapping corresponding domains between the two integrases will likely produce a functional protein and provide informative results. Using HIV-1/FIV chimeric integrases, the target site-specifying domain of integrase was mapped in the central core region, within amino acid residues 49–238 (30Shibagaki Y. Chow S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8361-8369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).This previously identified target site selection determinant contains a portion of the nonspecific DNA-binding domain, comprising amino acids 213–266 (44Engelman A. Hickman A.B. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5911-5917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Puras Lutzke R.A. Vink C. Plasterk R.H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4125-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Whether this particular DNA-binding region is involved in dictating integration site preference is not known. The core domain is also able to bind target DNA as observed in in vitro assays with the dumbbell disintegration substrate that mimics a single-ended integration event (52Gerton J.L. Brown P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, specific peptides within the core have been identified to be in close proximity to target DNA in UV cross-linking studies (53Heuer T.S. Brown P.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10655-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, new HIV-1/FIV chimeric integrases were prepared to determine if the nonspecific DNA-binding domain was responsible for target site selection. Another set of chimeric proteins was made to test for the involvement of certain α helices of the core domain in target site selection. Analysis of the above-mentioned chimeric integrases further narrowed the target site-specifying domain to within amino acid residues 49–187 and indicated that the α2 helix, residues 118–121, participates in target site selection.DISCUSSIONIntegration of retroviral DNA into the host chromosome is inherently a mutagenic event. Integration can have significant consequences to the well-being of the host cell, as exemplified by the ability of retroviruses to produce tumors in infected animals after natural or experimental infections (1Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Integration. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 161-203Google Scholar). Because integration is essential for productive viral infection, the sites chosen for integration may also be relevant to the virus to ensure its perpetuation. Integrases from different retroviruses have different target site preferences in vitro when using an identical target DNA substrate DNA (14Pryciak P.M. Muller H.P. Varmus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Therefore, a motif within integrase dictating this preference must exist, and integrase may play a significant role in selecting target DNA sites for integrationin vivo. We hypothesized that the target site-specifying motif is either part of a nonspecific DNA-binding region or comprises residues that are in close proximity to target DNA. HIV-1/FIV chimeric integrases were constructed for this study, and integration data from oligonucleotide- and PCR-based assays showed that target site selection resides within residues 49–187 of the integrase core and not within the nonspecific DNA-binding region, residues 213–266 (44Engelman A. Hickman A.B. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5911-5917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Puras Lutzke R.A. Vink C. Plasterk R.H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4125-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Additional chimeras were also made to test whether regions that were predicted to be in close proximity to target DNA within residues 49–187 were involved in target site selection. Integration data revealed that α helices 3 and 4 of the core domain (residues 123–166) were not responsible for choosing integration sites on target DNA. However, the α2 helix appeared to be involved in target site selection, because the chimeric integrase H(Fα2) preferred integration sites favored by both HIV-1 and FIV integrases. Although α2 helix alone is not sufficient for conferring target site specificity, we believe that the α2 helix is part of a larger or multiple motifs responsible for target site selection.The location of the target and viral DNA-binding regions of integrase has not been well established, and very little is known about the interaction between integrase and target DNA. A nonspecific DNA-binding region in the C terminus consisting of amino acid residues 213–266 was identified using deletion mutants of integrase in filter binding assays and Southwestern blotting (45Puras Lutzke R.A. Vink C. Plasterk R.H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4125-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 46Vink C. Oude Groeneger A.A.M. Plasterk R.H.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3507-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The nonspecific binding to DNA by this region is independent of divalent metal ion as observed in UV cross-linking studies (44Engelman A. Hickman A.B. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5911-5917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showed that, despite the ability to bind target DNA, the nonspecific DNA-binding domain within residues 213–266 is not involved in target site selection.Another DNA-binding region is identified in the core domain and consists of amino acid residues 50–186. The DNA binding of this region is divalent cation-dependent and substrate-specific. In the presence of Mn2+, this region is able to bind a disintegration substrate that mimics the single-ended integration event (44Engelman A. Hickman A.B. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5911-5917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Gerton J.L. Brown P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This DNA-binding region recognizes key features of viral DNA substrates and may be responsible for viral DNA specificity (19Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 41Katzman M. Sudol M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1744-1753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,52Gerton J.L. Brown P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25809-25815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition to viral DNA, UV cross-linking studies with HIV-1 integrase and a dumbbell disintegration substrate have identified residues 49–69 and 139–152 to be in close proximity to target DNA. The α2 (residues 118–121), α3 (residues 123–133), and α4 (residues 148–166) helices were chosen as candidates for involvement in target site selection based on their position in the core domain and close proximity to target DNA by molecular modeling (58Chen J.C. Krucinski J. Miercke L.J. Finer-Moore J.S. Tang A.H. Leavitt A.D. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8233-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 61Heuer T.S. Brown P.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6667-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this model, specific residues Ser-153 and Lys-160 of the α4 helix were proposed to be involved in hydrogen bonding with phosphate oxygens of nucleotides in target DNA. Also, type II restriction endonucleases and HIV-1 integrase share some structural similarities, and the α3 helix of HIV-1 integrase has been suggested to correspond to the DNA-binding long helices of endonucleases (64Venclovas C. Siksnys V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, neither the α3 nor the α4 helix is highly conserved between HIV-1 and FIV integrases, further suggesting that these helices are ideal for dictating a characteristic integration pattern. In the case of the α2 helix, not only is it positioned in close proximity to target DNA and the active site residue Asp-116, it has one divergent residue that is structurally different between the HIV-1 and FIV integrases. Amino acid 119 is a Ser in HIV-1 integrase, and the corresponding residue in FIV integrase is a Pro. Substituting the Ser at position 119 with Thr or Gly is one of the most frequently observed integrase variants in viral isolates from HIV-1-infected patients (65Skinner L.M. Lamers S.L. Sanders J.C. Eyster M.E. Goodenow M.M. Katzman M. J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1998; 19: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).The integration patterns produced by the chimeric integrases containing specific exchanges of α helices confirmed the importance of the α2 helix in target site selection and ruled out the involvement of the α3 and α4 helices. These results indicated that, although the residues Ser-153 and Lys-160 of the α4 helix may be positioned to bind target DNA, they are not involved in target site selection.The intermediate integration pattern obtained by H(Fα2) in the integration assay opens the door for further experiments to identify the minimal target site-specifying motif. The change from the inherent Ser at position 119 in HIV-1 integrase to Pro alters the side-chain moiety significantly and thereby may affect the interactions with the phosphodiester backbone of the target and the subsequent choice of integration sites. Perhaps the rest of the target site-specifying motif lies in proximity to the active site and comprises either a larger region encompassing the α2 helix or multiple regions of integrase, such as the α1 helix, β1 or β4 sheets of the core domain. Additional chimeric integrases can be constructed by exchanging regions outside of residues 123–166 together with the α2 helix. Because of its location in the core domain and its involvement in maintaining the dimer interface, it seems less likely that residues 167–187 would be involved in target site selection. Therefore, future studies on identifying the minimal target site-specifying motif should probably focus on regions between residues 49–122.The mechanisms of nonspecific and specific DNA recognition by catalytic molecules, such as transposases, ribozymes, and the restriction endonucleases vary, and our understanding of this process is limited. Nonspecific DNA binding in many cases does not require a metal ion, in contrast to specific recognition of a target site for proper catalysis (66Su L.J. Qin P.Z. Michels W.J. Pyle A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 67Brännvall M. Kirsebom L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Many class type II restriction endonucleases, such asBamHI and EcoRI, bind DNA nonspecifically and scan the substrate by either linear or facilitated diffusion to locate their cognate sites (68Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), whereas the type IIe endonucleaseEcoRII mediates specific DNA recognition allosterically (69Krüger D.H. Kupper D. Meisel A. Tierlich M. Reuter M. Schroeder C. Gene. 1995; 157: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar,70Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Perhaps in the case of integrase, the nonspecific DNA-binding site in the C terminus is responsible for scanning the target DNA by linear or facilitated diffusion and for stabilizing the recognition of the integration site by the target site-specifying motif in the core domain. It is also a possibility that a conformational change induced by the binding of divalent metal ions or viral DNA is necessary to unmask the target site-specifying motif (71Gao K. Butler S.L. Bushman F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Because DNA distortion and local DNA structures rather than primary DNA sequence are important factors in target site selection, perhaps specific local structures are more preferred by one integrase than the other. The target DNA may be complementary or made to fit the shape of the DNA-binding region, providing an energetically favorable interaction that results in DNA recognition. Shape recognition resulting in DNA binding is seen for many DNA-binding proteins and enzymes in crystal structures and molecular modeling (72Rhodes D. Schwabe J.W. Chapman L. Fairall L. Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. London. Ser. B: Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, the target site-specifying motifs of HIV-1 and FIV integrases need not be so divergent for choosing characteristic sites since a simple kink or bulky side-chain moiety may be enough to alter DNA recognition. In addition, small differences in residue composition can alter the spatial arrangement of waters, which may affect DNA interactions through hydrogen bonding.Attempts to modify restriction endonucleases to alter cleavage at a sequence similar to its cognate site have generally been unsuccessful. For instance, even though BglII and BamHI share a similar catalytic core topology, replacement of BglII's DNA recognition motif with that of BamHI does not alter the catalysis to the cognate BamHI site (73Dorner L.F. Bitinaite J. Whitaker R.D. Schildkraut I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 74Lukacs C.M. Kucera R. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The result indicates that DNA recognition is not solely dependent on the direct contacts made between the amino acids and the nucleotides but that the overall conformation of the protein also plays a critical role as seen in crystallographic studies (74Lukacs C.M. Kucera R. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This may also be a reason why we were not able to see a complete switch in integration patterns with the H(Fα2) chimeric integrase. Changing the other amino acids involved in stabilizing the active conformation or other DNA contacts may be necessary to see a complete switch for the choice of integration sites.Protein-DNA recognition is key for many cellular and viral processes, and identification of the motif involved in retroviral target site selection will provide a better understanding of the various mechanisms used by enzymes for this process. Further knowledge in this field may reveal new ways to manipulate the DNA specificity of enzymes for their use as therapeutics or molecular tools. Furthermore, pinpointing the target site-specifying motif within integrase will also help further evolve the model of the molecular interactions between integrase and target DNA, because structural data have been difficult to obtain. Currently, the chimeric protein approach has allowed us to test the role of several possible target DNA-binding regions for their involvement in target site selection and has narrowed the target site-specifying determinant within specific regions of the core domain.Note Added in ProofThe importance of residue 119 in the α2 helix of HIV-1 integrase in target site selection has also been described by Harper et al. (75Harper A.L. Skinner L.M. Sudol M. Katzman M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7756-7762Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Insertion of the viral genome into cellular DNA by the virally encoded protein, integrase, is a necessary step for the propagation of retroviruses. This essential event in the viral life cycle is termed integration and is a multistep process (for reviews see Refs. 1Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Integration. Retroviruses.

However, before their maturation in the spleen, immature B cells must be excluded from non-splenic secondary lymphoid organs where any antigen encounter would lead to the death of the cells because of the negative selection process. We have recently shown that immature B cells can actively exclude themselves from antigen-enriched sites by down-regulating their integrin-mediated adhesion in a process mediated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). In this study, we followed the pathway by which IFN-γ regulates the homing of B cells. We show here that the inhibitory signal of IFN-γ is transmitted through the IFN-γ receptor whose engagement leads to the activation of PI3K. This PI3K activation subsequently leads to the inhibition of PKCα phosphorylation and cytoskeleton rearrangement required for promoting integrin-mediated adhesion and migration of B cells.

One of the most important facilitators of leukocyte migration is chemokines, which bind a large subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. The targeted transmigration of leukocytes from peripheral blood into extravascular tissues is an important component of both immune surveillance and the inflammatory response. The adhesion of peripheral blood leukocytes to the endothelium in secondary lymphoid tissues or at peripheral sites of inflammation and their migration through the endothelium is a multiple-step process. Transient interactions with the vessel walls that enable rolling are followed by chemoattractant-mediated activation signals, which promote firm adhesion among integrin molecules on leukocytes and immunoglobulin superfamily ligands on the endothelium. In the next step lymphocytes are spread on the apical endothelial surface. Finally, cells migrate through intercellular borders and transmigrate beneath the monolayers (1Butcher E.C.

Immature B cells emerge from the bone marrow to the periphery and migrate into the spleen for their final maturation step. This migration proceeds through the terminal branches of central arterioles to blood sinusoids of the marginal zone (9Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2533-2540PubMed Google Scholar, 10Allman D.M. Ferguson S.E. Lentz V.M. Cancro M.P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4431-4444PubMed Google Scholar). Newly created B cells then penetrate the marginal zone sinus ending up in the outer zone of the periarteriolar lymphocytic sheath (11Lortan J.E. Roobottom C.A. Oldfield S. MacLennan I.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Before arriving to the spleen, immature B cells must be excluded from non-splenic secondary lymphoid organs, which are specialized tissues for collecting antigens (12Picker L.J. Butcher E.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 561-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), and from sites of infection and inflammation. In these secondary lymphoid organs in which differentiation to a mature phenotype does not occur, any antigen encounter would lead to the death of the immature B cells and thus the elimination of effective clones because of the negative selection process. Recently, we have demonstrated that immature B cells can down-regulate their own integrin-mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix and consequently suppress their migration, as well as that of mature B cells, into non-splenic sites of antigen presentation. In this way, immature B cells prevent premature encounter with antigen by autocrine down-regulation of their own migration. This inhibition is mediated by IFN-γ,1 which is transcribed and secreted by immature B cells but is dramatically down-regulated in mature B cells. Thus, IFN-γ has an inhibitory effect on the adhesion and migration of B cells (13Flaishon L. Hershkovitz R. Lantner F. Lider O. Alon R. Levo Y. Flavell R.A. Shachar I. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1381-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here, we analyzed the signaling pathway controlled by IFN-γ that is responsible for regulating the B cell homing. Interestingly, our studies revealed that low levels of IFN-γ initiate a cascade through the IFN-γ receptor involving PI3K, which interferes with the chemokine receptor-signaling pathway that involves PKCα. The down-regulation of PKCα phosphorylation results in the inhibition of adhesion and migration of B cells. The murine pre-B cell-like lymphoma line 70Z/3 (14Paige C.J. Kincade P.W. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 641-647PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in suspension culture at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 200 μmβ-mercaptoethanol. Primary B cells were obtained from control C57BL/6 and were purified by treating the splenocyte suspension with anti-Thy 1.2, CD4, and CD8 (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) followed by low Tox-M complement (Cederlane). Conditioned medium was collected from immature B cells from invariant chain-deficient mice (15Shachar I. Flavell R.A. Science. 1996; 274: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) as described previously (13Flaishon L. Hershkovitz R. Lantner F. Lider O. Alon R. Levo Y. Flavell R.A. Shachar I. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1381-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Adhesion assays were performed as described previously (13Flaishon L. Hershkovitz R. Lantner F. Lider O. Alon R. Levo Y. Flavell R.A. Shachar I. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1381-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis was assayed by using transwell chambers (diameter = 6.5 mm, pore = 5 μm) (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). Approximately 5 × 10670Z/3 cells were suspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium with 0.25% fetal calf serum. Next, 100 μl was placed in the upper compartment of the transwell apparatus and 600 μl of medium with or without 1 μg/ml SDF-1 (PeproTech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) was placed in the bottom chamber. The migration toward the chemokine SDF-1, residing in the lower part of the apparatus, was analyzed after 3 h by FACS in the presence or absence of IFN-γ or conditioned medium collected from invariant chain-deficient cells. In some experiments, cells were pre-incubated with anti-INF-γ receptor or anti-CD8 antibodies (PharMingen) for 2.5 h before the transwell assay. 70Z/3 cells were pre-incubated with or without conditioned medium collected from immature B cells or IFN-γ in the presence or absence of inhibitors for 30 min. The cells were then stimulated for 5 min with 0.2 μg/ml PMA and immediately frozen. Then the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 25 mmTris, pH 7.4, 2 mm Vanadate, 75 mmβ-glycophosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 10 mm NaPPi, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of the following protease inhibitors: 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma). Lysates or immunoprecipitates of p-tyr proteins were separated by 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and probed with anti p-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology), anti p-tyr (pTyr99), or PKCα (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories). 70Z/3 or primary B cells were pre-incubated in the presence or absence of immature B cell-conditioned medium or 0.1 unit/ml IFN-γ with or without the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin or LY29004 for 30 min. The cells were then washed and stimulated for 20 s with 500 ng/ml SDF-1 and immediately fixed by adding a 3-fold volume of 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Next, the cells were washed, and the membranes were permeabilized for 2 min on ice in a solution containing HEPES (20 mm), sucrose (300 mm), NaCl (50 mm), MgCl2 (3 mm), and Triton X-100 (0.1%). Finally, the cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin (2 μg/ml), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage increase of polymerized actin was calculated by subtracting the mean value of polymerized actin of non-activated cells from the mean value of activated cells and dividing it to the mean value of the non-activated cells multiplied by 100%. The PI3K inhibitors used were wortmannin (100 nm, Calbiochem) or LY29004 (200 mm, Calbiochem). The PKC inhibitors used were PKCα/β pseudosubstrate (10 μm, BioMol Research Laboratories), myristoylated-autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide, CaM kinase II inhibitor (10 μg/ml, BioMol Research Laboratories), the PKCδ inhibitor, rottlerin (5 μm, Calbiochem), and the PKC inhibitor, GF-109203X (bisindaylmaleimide I) (0.5 μm, Calbiochem). Low levels of IFN-γ are sufficient to inhibit the adhesion response of B cells to the extracellular matrix component, fibronectin. To analyze the mechanism by which IFN-γ regulates the adhesion and migration of B cells, we first searched for a B cell line that mimics the B cell response to IFN-γ. We wanted to identify a cell line that could increase its adhesion and migration as a consequence of chemokine stimulation, whereas low levels of IFN-γ inhibit the ability of the cells to respond. The 70Z/3 cell line is a murine pre-B lymphoma that meets these requirements. After PMA (Fig. 1 A) or SDF-1 (Fig. 1 B) stimulation, these cells increased their adhesion response, whereas conditioned medium derived from immature B cells (sup) and low levels of IFN-γ down-regulated this adhesion process. High levels of IFN-γ had no effect on the adhesion response. We further studied the effect of the inhibitory treatment of immature B cell-conditioned medium and IFN-γ on the transwell migration of 70Z/3 cells toward the chemokine SDF-1. As shown in Fig. 1 C, cells pre-incubated with these inhibitors markedly down-regulated their migration toward SDF-1. Thus, 70Z/3 cells respond to various stimuli and are sensitive to the inhibitory treatments, similarly to primary B cells. Therefore, they serve as an appropriate system to monitor the signaling pathway induced by IFN-γ. To determine whether the IFN-γ-induced inhibition of cell adhesion and migration is initiated by the IFN-γ receptor (IFNR) (16Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar, 17Bach E. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar) or by a novel receptor not previously described, we analyzed the involvement of this receptor in the inhibitory pathway. 70Z/3 cells were pre-treated for 3 h with anti-IFN-γ receptor or anti-CD8 antibodies. Cells were then washed and stimulated with PMA in the presence or absence of IFN-γ or immature B cell-conditioned medium. As shown in Fig. 2 A, whereas control antibodies (anti-CD8) did not influence the inhibitory effect of the conditioned medium and IFN-γ, the antibodies against the interferon-γ receptor dramatically abrogated the inhibitory effect of the cell supernatant or IFN-γ. To further demonstrate that IFNR binds IFN-γ and regulates migration, we monitored the transwell migration of 70Z/3. Whereas the migration of cells pre-treated with antibodies against the IFN-γ receptor in the presence of IFN-γ was similar to the migration of wild-type cells, control anti-CD8 antibodies could not reverse the inhibited migration of the cells (Fig. 2 B). Thus, blocking the binding of IFN-γ reversed the inhibition induced by this cytokine. Therefore, low levels of IFN-γ that are sufficient to inhibit the adhesion and migration of cells are recognized by the IFN-γ receptor, which transmits a signal that perturbs the cell adhesion response. To monitor downstream molecules involved in IFN-γ-induced adhesion regulation, we studied the effect of various signal transduction inhibitors in reversing the inhibitory effect of IFN-γ. Although SB-202190 (data not shown) and PD-98059 (Fig. 3 A) did not affect the inhibition of this cytokine in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, adhesion was dramatically increased (Fig. 3 A). We further studied the role of the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin or Ly-294002, in the IFN-γ-induced inhibition. PI3K inhibitors, as previously described, slightly suppressed SDF-1-stimulated 70Z/3 cell adhesion on their own (18Wang J.F. Park I.W. Groopman J.E. Blood. 2000; 95: 2505-2513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these inhibitors also reversed the immature B cell-conditioned medium and IFN-γ inhibition of the adhesion response. Cells treated with either immature B cell-conditioned medium or IFN-γ in the presence of PI3K inhibitors adhered to fibronectin similarly to cells incubated in the presence of PMA and wortmannin or Ly-294002 (Fig. 3 B). This demonstrates a potential role for PI3K in the adhesion of cells. To determine the involvement of PI3K in IFN-γ-induced inhibition, we sought to determine whether the Akt kinase, a known downstream element of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase pathway (19Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), is activated by this cytokine. As shown in Fig. 3 C, in the presence of IFN-γ there was an increased Akt phosphorylation demonstrating that Akt kinase is a downstream effector of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase in IFN-γ signaling. In the presence of higher levels of IFN-γ, a reduced phosphorylation of Akt was observed (Fig. 3 D) showing a dose dependence of the effect of this cytokine on Akt phosphorylation. To follow downstream molecules involved in IFN-γ-induced adhesion regulation, we analyzed the effect of IFN-γ on tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins following PMA stimulation of 70Z/3 cells. Cells were treated with PMA in the presence or absence of IFN-γ or immature B cell-conditioned medium. Our targets were proteins, which could respond to PMA by changing their tyrosine phosphorylation levels and whose PMA response was attenuated by IFN-γ. To identify such candidate proteins, 70Z/3 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of IFN-γ or immature B cell supernatant for 30 min. After 5 min of PMA stimulation, the cells were immediately frozen, and their proteins were analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blot analysis. An 85-kDa protein was significantly phosphorylated following PMA induction. Stimulated cells, which were incubated with IFN-γ (Fig. 4 A), or immature B cell-conditioned medium (Fig. 4 B) exhibited reduced phosphorylation, suggesting the negative regulation of the tyrosine-phosphorylation signaling pathway via a specific protein in this cascade. The 85-kDa protein appeared to be a key element in the IFN-γ-controlled adhesion pathway. To identify this protein, we followed the phosphorylation of various known proteins with a molecular weight of approximately 85. Proteins from PMA-induced or non-induced cells, which were incubated in the presence or absence of IFN-γ, were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against various known proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the appearance of PKCα matched the pattern observed in the phosphotyrosine blot showing an elevation in phosphorylation after PMA stimulation and down-regulation of this process by IFN-γ. In addition, the treatment of the cells with wortmannin restored the phosphorylation of PKCα, suggesting the involvement of PI3K in the IFN-γ-induced inhibition of adhesion (Fig. 4 D). This sensitivity to IFN-γ was specific to PKCα, because the phosphorylation of PKCδ was not affected by this cytokine (data not shown). Consistent with this notion, the PKCα/β pseudosubstrate inhibitor dramatically down-regulated the adhesion of PMA or SDF-1-stimulated cells to fibronectin (Fig. 4 E). Among the requirements for inducible integrin-mediated adhesion are an increased rate of actin polymerization and the extensive reorganization of the actin-based cytoskeleton. Chemokines promote a rapid burst of actin polymerization, which peaks at 30 s to 1 min and subsides to base-line levels within 5–10 min post-stimulation. To determine whether the adhesion inhibition induced by IFN-γ involves the inhibition of cytoskeletal rearrangement, we monitored actin polymerization in 70Z/3 cells that were pre-incubated in the presence or absence of IFN-γ and stimulated by SDF-1. The cells were immediately fixed with paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin and analyzed by flow cytometry for their cytoskeleton rearrangement. As shown in Fig. 5 A, SDF-1 stimulation induced actin polymerization, which was dramatically down-regulated by immature B cell-conditioned medium or IFNγ. Thus, low levels of IFN-γ inhibit adhesion by decreasing cytoskeleton rearrangement. In the presence of IFN-γ and the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin or LY-294002, actin polymerization was restored (Figs. 5, C andD) allowing the adhesion of the cells, which indicates that PI3K is involved in IFN-γ down-regulation of actin polymerization. Both the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X and a PKCα/β pseudosubstrate inhibitor blocked the actin polymerization induced by SDF-1, whereas the PKCδ inhibitor did not have any effect (Fig. 5 B), demonstrating that PKCα is indeed a crucial downstream component of the SDF-1-induced adhesion and migration pathway. Finally, to show that IFN-γ inhibits primary B cell adhesion using the pathway described earlier, we analyzed the role of PI3K and PKCα in the polymerization of actin in these cells. Similar to 70Z/3 cells, low levels of IFN-γ strikingly down-regulated the actin polymerization of the B splenocytes (Fig. 6 A), showing that the lack of adhesion induced by IFN-γ is because of its effect on the organization of the cytoskeleton. The PI3K inhibitor LY-294002, although its own partial inhibitory effect on actin polymerization, increased the IFN-γ-inhibited cytoskeleton rearrangement (Fig. 6 A). In addition, the PKCα/β pseudosubstrate down-regulated the SDF-1-induced actin polymerization while a control peptide, an inhibitor of CaM kinase II, had no effect on this response (Fig. 6 B). Thus, the IFN-γ inhibitory pathway in B splenocytes uses the same key molecules as determined for 70Z/3 cells. Therefore, IFN-γ down-regulates the adhesion of B cells by a pathway initiated by the IFN-γ receptor. The activation of this receptor consequently induces a PI3K-signaling cascade, which inhibits PKCα phosphorlyation. This process results in the down-regulation of actin polymerization and cell adhesion and migration. Cell migration is controlled by multi-step processes that include chemoattraction, cell–cell adhesion, and transmigration through cell layers (20Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar, 21Butcher E.C. Williams M. Youngman K. Rott L. Briskin M. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 209-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemotactic signals play important roles in leukocyte navigation by regulating the migration from the blood into tissues, as well as subsequent localization within the microenvironment of these tissues. Chemokines transmit directional signals to leukocytes by binding to seven-transmembrane receptors that are coupled to pertussis toxin-inhibitable heterotrimers (22Foxman E.F. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1349-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Several chemokines attract primary B cells and play a role in the homing and microenvironmental localization of B cell subsets at different stages of antigen-dependent and antigen-independent B cell differentiation (23Bowman E.P. Campbell J.J. Soler D. Dong Z. Manlongat N. Picarella D. Hardy R.R. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1303-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that immature B cells are able to auto-inhibit their homing to antigen-enriched compartments. This regulation is mediated by autocrine secretion of low levels of interferon-γ, which inhibits the response of cells to chemokine stimulation and their ability to adhere to the extracellular matrix component, fibronectin (13Flaishon L. Hershkovitz R. Lantner F. Lider O. Alon R. Levo Y. Flavell R.A. Shachar I. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1381-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the mechanism by which IFN-γ regulates the homing of B cells. We have demonstrated that the IFN-γ receptor is responsible for the inhibitory effect induced by IFN-γ. This receptor transmits a signal through PI3K that results in the inhibition of actin polymerization and the extensive reorganization of the actin-based cytoskeleton, which is required for inducible integrin-mediated adhesion. The involvement of IFNR in IFN-γ-induced homing inhibition suggests that this receptor binds both low and high levels of IFN-γ, however, the outcome response is different. Whereas high levels of IFN-γ augment the inflammatory response, binding low levels of this cytokine induces a down-regulation of adhesion and migration of cells and consequently the inhibition of the immune response. We have shown that the inhibitory signal transmitted by this receptor involves the PI3K. The IFN-γ receptor consists of two distinct subunits, IFNR1 and IFNR2. The major ligand-binding subunit is IFNR1, which also plays an important role in IFN-γ signaling (16Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar, 17Bach E. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). IFNR2 plays a minimal role in ligand binding, but its signaling function is critical in the generation of IFN-γ signals (16Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3388) Google Scholar, 24Hemmi S. Bohni R. Stark G. Di Marco F. Aguet M.

Cell. 1994; 76: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The signaling cascades activated by the IFN-γ receptor involve the two tyrosine kinases associated with the IFNR1 and IFNR2 receptor subunits, Jak-1 and Jak-2 (26Bach E.A. Tanner J.W. Marsters S. Ashkenazi A. Aguet M. Shaw A.S. Schreiber R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3214-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27Sakatsume M. Igarashi K. Winestock K.D. Garotta G. Larner A.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, these subunits phosphorylate IFNR1, providing docking sites for the Stat-1 transcriptional activator. Several other components are activated during the engagement of this receptor including the SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, CrkL and CrkII, respectively, and the Vav protooncogene (29Platanias L.C. Fish E.N. Exp. Hematol. 1999; 27: 1583-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In addition, IFN-γ was shown to stimulate the tyrosyl phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1. Insulin receptor substrate 1 may interact with JAK2 or an auxiliary molecule that binds to JAK2 (30Argetsinger L.S. Hsu G.W. Myers M.G. Billestrup N. White M.F. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14685-14692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the Src homology 2 domains from the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K bind to unique residues within insulin receptor substrate 1 (31Myers M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the IFN-γ receptor might activate a cascade through insulin receptor substrate 1, which binds to PI3K. The involvement of PI3K in chemotaxis has been investigated with contradictory results from various studies. For example, treatment with PI3K inhibitors, including Wortmannin and LY-294002, inhibited chemotaxis in some studies (32Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 33Harakawa N. Sasada M. Maeda A. Asagoe K. Nohgawa M. Takano K. Matsuda Y. Yamamoto K. Okuma M. J.

Commun. 1995; 217: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Studies of mice lacking PI3Kγ showed that PI3Kγ appears to play an important role necessary for neutrophil chemotaxis (36Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C. Azzolino O. Pirola L. Ilengo L. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Altruda F. Wymann M.P. Science. 2000; 287: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 37Li Z. Jiang H. Xie W. Zhang Z. Smrcka A.V. Wu D.

Kozieradzki I. Joza N. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Suzuki A. Penninger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 1040-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The importance of PI3Kγ in chemotaxis appears to be restricted to the myeloid lineage, because PI3Kγ deficiency does not alter the chemotactic activities of spleen B cells in response to SDF-1, MIP3β, or fractalkine (39Wu D. Huang C.K. Jiang H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2935-2940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, we showed that PI3K has a role in the adhesion of B cells, its inhibition slightly down-regulates their cytoskeleton rearrangement and adhesion. However, PI3K plays a crucial role in the negative regulation of the adhesion and migration of cells induced by IFN-γ. In the presence of IFN-γ, there is increased Akt phosphorylation, demonstrating that Akt kinase is a downstream effector of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase in IFN-γ signaling. Furthermore, the adhesion and cytoskeleton rearrangement of cells treated with IFN-γ in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor were dramatically up-regulated and retrieved adhesion, showing that despite its inhibitory effect on adhesion it inhibits the IFN-γ effect. Our studies show that SDF-1 and PMA induce adhesion and migration of cells by activating PKCα. Following PMA activation, PKCα is phosphorylated and translocates to the membranes (data not shown). In addition, SDF-1 activation leads to augmented cytoskeletal rearrangement, a process that is down-regulated by a specific PKCα/β inhibitor. Thus, stimulation of B cells leads to actin polymerization and adhesion by a PKCα-mediated pathway. It was previously shown that the unphosphorylated primary translation product of PKCα has little or no activity. Upon ligand binding at the membrane, PKC becomes a substrate for kinases acting on the activation loop and hydrophobic C-terminal sites on the PKC molecule. Following subsequent autophosphorylation, the kinase domain acquires a closed conformation that confers stability and phosphatase resistance (40Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). We show here that low levels of IFN-γ are sufficient to inhibit B cell adhesion and migration by down-regulating the PKCα phosphorylation, resulting in reduced actin polymerization and consequently reduced cell adhesion. Blocking the IFNR signal by the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin restored PKCα phosphorylation, a process that results in the up-regulation of adhesion. The results presented here demonstrate that the secretion of low levels of IFN-γ by immature B cells inhibit the adhesion and migration of B cells by interfering with the chemokine receptor-signaling pathway, which results in the inhibition of cytoskeleton rearrangement and adhesion.

https://openalex.org/W2028602105,"Members of the nuclear receptor superfamily play key roles in a host of physiologic and pathologic processes from embryogenesis to cancer. Some members, including the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), are activated by ligand binding but are unaffected in their subcellular distribution, which is predominantly nuclear. In contrast, several members of the steroid receptor family, including the glucocorticoid receptor, are cytoplasmic and only translocate to the nucleus after ligand binding. We have constructed chimeras between RAR and glucocorticoid receptor that selectively respond to RAR agonists but display cytoplasmic localization in the absence of ligand. These chimeric receptors manifest both nuclear translocation and gene activation functions in response to physiological concentrations of RAR ligands. The ability to achieve regulated subcellular trafficking with a heterologous ligand binding domain has implications both for current models of receptor translocation and for structural-functional conservation of ligand binding domains broadly across the receptor superfamily. When coupled to the green fluorescent protein, chimeric receptors offer a powerful new tool to 1) study mechanisms of steroid receptor translocation, 2) detect dynamic and graded distributions of ligands in complex microenvironments such as embryos, and 3) screen for novel ligands of “orphan” receptors in vivo.

The recent characterization of functional GFP fusions with the steroid/nuclear receptors allows study of real time movement for these molecules within living cells (9Hager G.L. Conn M.P. Green Fluorescent Protein. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 73-84Google Scholar). The unliganded GFP-GR is found completely in the cytoplasm, whereas the hormone-activated receptor is located almost exclusively in the nucleus shortly after hormone activation (9Hager G.L. Conn M.P. Green Fluorescent Protein. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 73-84Google Scholar, 10Htun H. Barsony J. Renyi I. Gould D.J. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Because nuclear translocation by this intrinsically fluorescent receptor is quite dramatic and easily monitored in real time in vivo, it can provide a straightforward methodology to detect physiological concentrations of receptor ligand in the cellular environment. The availability of chimeric proteins with the nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation properties of GR, and the ligand responsiveness of the nuclear receptors, would provide a powerful translocation assay for nuclear receptor ligands and potentially for novel analogues, as well. Many chimeric receptors have been described (e.g. see Ref.12Solomin L. Johansson C.B. Zetterstrom R.H. Bissonnette R.P. Heyman R.A. Olson L. Lendahl U. Frisen J. Perlmann T. Nature. 1998; 395: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), but these fusions have been characterized exclusively in terms of their gene activation potential. We describe here a GR-RAR chimeric protein 2Patent pending on the GR-RAR chimera. that resides primarily in the cytoplasm of untreated cells but manifests complete nuclear translocation when cells are induced with the normal RAR ligand, all-trans-retinoic acid. This chimera forms the basis for a new, in vivo translocation assay for nuclear receptor ligands and has important implications for mechanisms of receptor subcellular trafficking. The 1471.1 cell line was used for all studies (13Smith C.L. Archer T.K. Hamlin-Green G. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% characterized fetal calf serum (FCS; Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT),l-glutamine, and antibiotics. For transient transfections, 2 × 107 cells were resuspended in cold DMEM (without serum) with the indicated plasmids and incubated on ice for 1 min. Electroporations were done in a BTX Electro Square Porator (San Diego, CA) at 140 V, 3 pulses, and 10-ms pulse length followed by a 10-min recovery on ice. Cells were then plated and allowed to recover overnight in complete media. Sequences 3′ to the coding region for helix 1 (H1) of the LBD of GFP-tagged rat GR (pCI-nGFP-C656G; see Fig.1) were replaced by a multiple cloning site (MCS) polylinker as follows. A polymerase chain reaction fragment was generated to contain GR sequences including a unique SphI site and extending through the end of the LBD H1 with the MCS fused at the 3′ end, using the primers AAAAGAGCAGTGGAAGGA (5′) and GGTCTAGAATTCCC-TCGAGAGGCCTCGCGAAACAGAGCTATCATATCC (3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was restricted with SphI and XbaI and inserted at the corresponding SphI and XbaI sites in pCI-nGFP-C656G. A version tagged with EGFP was also made by cloning the NheI filled in BspEI fragment from EGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) between theNheI and filled in BssHII sites of the LBD-deleted C656G GR. The LBD-deleted C656G GR constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Different GR-RAR chimeras were generated by cloning portions of the LBD from a human RAR-α cDNA (gift from K. Ozato) in-frame into the MCS of LBD-deleted GR. The chimera shown in Fig. 1 was made by fusing the RAR-LBD, starting at the end of its H1 coding region (from amino acid 195) and extending through the end of the coding sequence and 300 bases of 3′ untranslated region, to the end of the GR LBD H1 region. The RAR-LBD-containing fragment fromFspI (filled in) to EcoRI was cloned between theXhoI (filled in) and the EcoRI sites of LBD-deleted C656G GR and was confirmed by sequencing. For fluorescence microscopy, cells were electroporated with 2 μg of GFP-GR-RAR, GFP-GR, or GFP-RAR. After electroporation, 1/24th of the cells were plated in each well of a 6-well dish onto a clean 1.5 glass coverslip in DMEM containing 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FCS (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). The next day, cells were treated with the indicated ligand for 1 h, and cells on coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, inverted onto microscope slides, and immediately viewed on a Leica TCS SP scanning confocal microscope. GFP was excited with a 488-nm laser line supplied from an air-cooled argon laser. GFP emission was monitored between 505 and 590 nm with a pinhole setting of 1.0. Cells were electroporated with 5 μg of pLTRLuc (containing the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter) and 0.7 μg of pCMV-β-Gal with or without 10 μg of the indicated receptor expression vector as described above. Cells were plated in duplicate in 100-mm dishes in DMEM containing 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FCS (as above) and allowed to recover overnight. The next day, cells were treated with the indicated ligand for 6 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase were assayed as described (3Lim C.S. Baumann C.T. Htun H. Xian W.J. Irie M. Smith C.L. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 366-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were harvested at 36–48 h and lysed in 300 μl of HEM (20 mmHepes, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mmsodium molybdate) + 0.5% Nonidet P-40 + 2 mmdithiothreitol per 107 cells for 5 min at 4 °C. A protease inhibitor mixture was also included. Nuclei were pelleted, and the cytoplasmic extract was precleared with blank protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C and then immunoadsorbed against protein G-Sepharose pre-loaded with anti-GFP antibody (monoclonal antibody 3E6; QBiogene) overnight at 4 °C. Sepharose pellets were then washed with 3 × 1 ml of HEM + 50 mm NaCl + 0.5% Tween 20, boiled in electrophoresis loading buffer, run on 4–12% BisTris gradient gels (NuPage; Invitrogen), and blotted. Western blots were sequentially probed first with anti-HSP90 (monoclonal antibody H90–10; gift from David Toft), then with anti-GFP (monoclonal antibody 11E5; QBiogene), and finally with anti-GR (antipeptide (amino acids 346–367) polyclonal antibody PA1–511A; Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.). Our goal was to modify the LBD of GFP-GR in such a way that the unique cytoplasmic/nuclear translocation activity of GR would be maintained, but the modified chimera would respond to a nuclear receptor ligand. The development of such a system faces several potential problems. First, insofar as they are understood, the nuclear localization signals of GR are embedded within the LBD and the C-terminal region of the DNA binding domain (14Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Thus, complete replacement of the GR LBD might disrupt the regulated translocation signals we intend to utilize. Second, GR interacts (in the cytoplasm) with a complex array of chaperon proteins, including HSP90 and HSP70, and ligand-dependent displacement of these proteins is thought to be intimately involved in the translocation process (15Pratt W.B. Sanchez E.R. Bresnick E.H. Meshinchi S. Scherrer L.C. Dalman F.C. Welsh M.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49 Suppl. 8: 2222-2229Google Scholar). Interaction domains critical for HSP90 binding are located within helix 1 of the GR LBD (16Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and steroid binding also requires contacts between an LXXLL motif in helix 1 and hydrophobic residues in the ligand binding pocket of the LBD (17Giannoukos G.

However, the nuclear receptor group (thyroid hormone receptor and RAR) does not interact with the chaperone proteins (26Dalman F.C. Koenig R.J. Perdew G.H. Massa E. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3615-3618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dalman F.C. Sturzenbecker L.J. Levin A.A. Lucas D.A. Perdew G.H. Petkovitch M. Chambon P. Grippo J.F. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5605-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), at least in the “docking” capacity implicated in cytoplasmic retention for the steroid receptors. Furthermore, some of the hydrophobic “contacts” in the steroid binding pocket that are proposed to interact with the LXXLL motif (17Giannoukos G. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36527-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are not conserved between the LBD of GR and some of the nuclear receptors such as RAR. Thus, removal or alteration of the GR LBD could disrupt both the chaperone interaction domains and the nuclear localization signals in this region of the protein. Additionally, perturbing the interactions of the LXXLL motif with the LBD might also abrogate ligand-dependent translocation, because these interactions are important for steroid binding. With this perspective, GFP-GR-RAR fusions were generated, in which the GR LBD was replaced by the corresponding domain from RAR preserving the GR helix 1 region intact, and evaluated for transactivation potential and cellular distribution of the chimeric proteins. One chimera (referred to here as GR-RAR; see Fig. 1) was retinoid-regulated in both transactivation function and subcellular trafficking (see Fig.2 and Fig. 3). Ligand-dependent transactivation was tested in transient transfection assays with a mouse mammary tumor virus-luciferase reporter. The GR* parent construct used has an LBD point mutation that increases agonist (dexamethasone) sensitivity by 20-fold (28Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) over the endogenous cellular GR (Fig. 2, compare Control with GR* for 1 nm Dex versus 100 nm Dex). GR-RAR is refractory to Dex but strongly activated by 100 nmall-trans-retinoic-acid (ATRA). Furthermore, no competition for cofactors (“squelching”) by the chimera is observed when the endogenous cellular GR is induced by 100 nm Dex (Fig. 2, GR* versus GR-RAR), because the GR-RAR chimera remains cytoplasmic in the presence of Dex (see below). Thus the chimeric protein behaves as a retinoic acid-dependent transactivator but is nonresponsive to GR agonists.Figure 3Subcellular trafficking of chimeric receptor. Mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cells (1471.1) were transfected with GFP-GR-RAR (panels A–C), GFP-GR (panels D–F), or GFP-RAR (panels G–I). Cells were treated for 1 h with medium containing only charcoal-stripped serum (panels A, D, and G), 100 nm dexamethasone (panels B, E, andH), or 100 nm ATRA (panels C,F, and I). In those examples where the subcellular distribution is nuclear (panels C, E,G, H, and I), the cell outline is indicated by a dashed white line. The cells shown inpanels D and I are binucleate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Subcellular trafficking was examined in response to ligands. Representative examples of results are shown in Fig.3; in each case, essentially all of the transfected cells in culture responded uniformly in the same manner as the examples shown. The GR receptor is completely cytoplasmic in the absence of ligand and becomes exclusively nuclear in response to Dex (Fig. 3, panels D and E) but is unaffected by ATRA (Fig. 3, panel F). Wild-type RAR is always nuclear, as expected (Fig. 3, panels G–I). GR-RAR is cytoplasmic in non-treated cells and remains cytoplasmic after Dex treatment (Fig. 3,panels A and B) but translocates to the nucleus with ATRA (Fig. 3, panel C). That is, the GR-RAR chimera retains the cytoplasmic localization of ligand-free wild-type GR but translocates in response to the normal RAR ligand rather than GR agonists. Xu et al. (16Xu M. Dittmar K.D. Giannoukos G. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13918-13924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) suggest that a seven-residue region in helix 1 of the LBD is all that is required for stable HSP90 binding by GR and attribute the requirement for other sequences seen in earlier studies (e.g. see Refs. 29Howard K.J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3482-3490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the necessity of maintaining a properly folded protein structure. Accordingly, the ability of the chimeric GR-RAR receptor to interact with HSP90 should be preserved, because the GR heptapeptide sequence is still present but in the context of a new LBD. Because the cytoplasmic interaction with HSP90 is thought to be critical for steroid binding and regulated translocation of the receptor (15Pratt W.B. Sanchez E.R. Bresnick E.H. Meshinchi S. Scherrer L.C. Dalman F.C. Welsh M.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49 Suppl. 8: 2222-2229Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether the ability of the chimeric GR-RAR receptor to interact with HSP90 is retained. Cytoplasmic extracts from cells transfected with GR, the GR-RAR chimera fused to GFP, or with native EGFP were each immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, and the precipitates were probed for the presence of bound HSP90 (Fig.4). Both cytoplasmic GR and GR-RAR chimera interacted specifically with HSP90, whereas EGFP did not, suggesting that HSP90 interactions key to ligand-regulated translocation have indeed been conserved in the chimeric protein. Availability of crystal structures for the LBD of several receptors has led to a compelling model for LBD structural rearrangements involved in ligand binding and coactivator interactions (18McGrath M.E.

In contrast, the receptor transitions responsible for intracellular trafficking are not well understood, and no general model exists to account for the subcellular distribution of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily. The GR-RAR chimera provides a new experimental paradigm to elucidate mechanisms of ligand-induced nuclear translocation. Simons and colleagues (17Giannoukos G. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36527-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) identified an LXXLL motif in helix 1 of the GR LBD as critical for steroid binding. This motif contacts residues in helix 8 and 9 of the steroid binding pocket, acting as a “clasp” for the binding pocket. These investigators proposed an intramolecular “hinged pocket” model as the LBD molecular rearrangement involved in hormone binding. The helix 1 region from the GR LBD is intact in the GR-RAR chimera (Fig. 1), although the steroid binding pocket itself has been switched. Furthermore, the amino acids in helix 8 and 9 proposed to make critical contacts with LXXLL based on considerations from the progesterone receptor LBD crystal structure (17Giannoukos G. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36527-36536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) are not well conserved between GR and RAR. Thus, a further examination of the hinged pocket model would seem to be warranted. The ability to swap LBDs and obtain novel ligand-regulated translocation has important implications for the structural requirements necessary to maintain ligand-mediated translocation and will serve as a valuable tool in elucidating how the ligand-induced structural transition is transmitted from the RAR-LBD to domains of the chimeric protein critical for translocation. It is also evident from the present results that it should be feasible to easily generate similar chimeras using other receptor LBDs to identify new ligands and to detect ligand levels in situ. Such chimeras provide a ligand detection tool fundamentally distinct from existing techniques, which test receptor responses at the gene activation, or transcriptional, level. The approach described here tests directly for the ability of an LBD to induce translocation, and hence interactions with transcriptional coactivators, chromatin remodeling factors, etc., are unlikely to play a significant role. For example, the GFP-coupled GR-RAR chimera provides the unique capability to directly see dynamic, temporospatial distributions of retinoids in real time, in live organisms. Retinoids are thought to function as “morphogens” in a number of developmental processes, but retinoic acid gradients have yet to be directly demonstrated. Localization efforts using retinoid-responsive promoters to drive reporter genes are inherently limited by the slow response and level of sensitivity to ligand (in co-cultures of reporter cells with tissue explants (31Wagner M.

In contrast, the translocation-based assay is rapid (20–30 min of exposure), is visualized directly in vivo, and is independent of the particular transcriptional milieu of the cell. Screens for novel receptor ligands using transcriptional reporters are similarly limited, whereas the translocation assay with a GFP-tagged chimera requires no biochemical manipulations and allows rapid, direct visualization in living cells. Epifluorescent cellular imaging systems driven by artificial intelligence software can now automatically scan and quantify the subcellular distribution of fluorescent molecules in large numbers of living cell pools. These imaging systems, coupled with such a translocation assay, can be employed in high throughput screens for novel receptor ligands in vivo.

With Fe2+ ions or ATP-Fe2+ complexes bound to Na+,K+-ATPase, addition of ascorbate with H2O2 generates OH⋅ radicals locally (or the reactive metal-peroxyl intermediates), and these selectively cleave the polypeptide chain (32Stadtman E.R.

Because more than one peptide bond can be cleaved from the same metal site, the technique has the important feature of providing information on proximity of cleaved segments in the native protein. In the case of cleavage by the ATP-Fe2+complex, the properties indicate that the Fe2+ ion is ligated by residues normally occupied by Mg2+ ions, and thus cleavages reveal contacts of Fe2+ or Mg2+ions (28Patchornik G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11954-11959Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cleavages catalyzed by Fe2+ ions and the ATP-Fe2+ complex have provided evidence that bothE 1 → E 2 and E 1P → E 2P conformational changes are associated with large movements in the cytoplasmic domains and also with a change in ligation of Mg2+ ions between E 1P and E 2P (26Goldshleger R.

Several cleavage points of the Na+,K+-ATPase lie within the most highly conserved sequences of P-type pumps, and the experiments indicate that they play a major role in binding phosphate or the γ-phosphate of ATP (369DKTGT and 607MVTGD in the P domain) or Mg2+ ions (708TGDGVNDS in the P domain,212TGESE in the A domain, and near 440VAGDA in the N domain), and mediating the domain interactions. This hypothesis is consistent with the recently published 2.6-Å crystal structure of Ca2+-ATPase (36Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar) and also of proteins with a homologous fold of the phosphorylation domain such haloacid dehalogenase (HAD), phosphonatase, and phosphoserine phosphatase (37Aravind L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10385-10396Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In particular, the proposed domain movements are consistent with inferred structural changes of Ca2+-ATPase (36Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 42Ogawa H. Stokes D.L. Sasabe H. Toyoshima C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 41-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Throughout this paper, the structure of Ca2+-ATPase in anE 1Ca conformation (PDB identification code 1EUL) and a theoretical model of the protein in an E 2conformation (PDB identification code 1FQU) serve to illustrate the concepts and clarify experimental design (Figs. 1 and 2). Sequences and residue numbering depicted in the figures are for Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), whereas sequences or residue numbering related to cleavage fragments refer to H+,K+-ATPase or Na+,K+-ATPase, respectively. Fig. 1 presents an overview of the two models and highlights residues at or near cleavage sites or in domains of interest. Fig. 2 presents a more detailed view of residues in the active site with a bound Fe2+, based on the E 2 model (1FQU). TheE 2 model was produced by moving the cytoplasmic N, P, and A domains and the trans-membrane segments of the known structure, in the E 1 conformation, so as to make them fit the electron density envelope of the molecule inE 2 at 8-Å resolution (42Ogawa H. Stokes D.L. Sasabe H. Toyoshima C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 41-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It can be assumed that the differences of the N, P, and A domains inE 1 and E 2 conformations are much better defined than are those of the trans-membrane segments. Domain A consists of the N terminus and the loop between M2 and M3, the P domain consists of the N-terminal region of the loop between M4 and M5 (residues 330–359) and the C-terminal region (residues 605–737), and the N domain consists of the residues between 359 and 605. One clear difference is that the N, P, and A domains are well separated inE 1, whereas in E 2 the three domains are docked closely together. The structural organization of the molecule, as well as features of cleavages catalyzed by Fe2+ ions and a complex of Cu2+ ions with bathophenanthroline (31Tal D.M. Capasso J.M. Munson K. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12505-12514Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), led us to propose the existence of two Fe2+ sites (29Goldshleger R. Patchornik G. Bar Shimon M. Tal D.M. Post R.L. Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomemb. 2001; 33: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Site 1 consists of residues within highly conserved sequences in the P domain (351DKTGT,701TGDGVNDS, 623MITGD) and A domain (181TGES), respectively (SERCA sequences). As seen in Fig.1, the highlighted residues Asp351, Thr353, Asp703, Asp707, Thr625, and Glu183 indicate the location of the conserved sequences. Site 1 exists in E 2 conformations but disappears in E 1 conformations. It is striking that Asp351, Thr353, Asp703, Asp707, Thr625 in the P domain can be virtually superimposed in E 1 and E 2conformations. The major difference is that, inE 2, the A domain docks with the N and P domains, the 212TGES sequence in the A domain approaching the active site residues in the P domain and creating a cage for Fe2+binding (see Fig. 2). Residues Glu439 and Lys515 in the N domain are also highlighted in Fig. 1 and will be discussed in relation to cleavage catalyzed by the ATP-Fe2+ complex. Cleavages of Na+,K+-ATPase indicate that site 2 for Fe2+ is located near the entrance of trans-membrane segments M3 (within the sequence 283HFIH) and M1 and is insensitive to E 1 ↔ E 2conformations. A homology model of the membrane domain, in which sequences of Ca2+-ATPase were replaced by those of Na+,K+-ATPase, shows close proximity of283HFIH (M3) and 81EWVK (M1) (31Tal D.M. Capasso J.M. Munson K. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12505-12514Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The corresponding sequences of Ca2+-ATPase 255EFGE and 49LWEL are also close together inE 1 (Fig. 1, left). InE 2 (Fig. 1, right), these sequences appear to separate but, as mentioned above, the theoretical model may not be reliable in the trans-membrane region.Figure 2Detail of the active site of Ca2+-ATPase in an E 2 conformation.

The experiments described here test this hypothesis and demonstrate a striking similarity of the structural changes, associated with E 1 ↔ E 2conformational transitions, in H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase, as well as applicability of the Fe2+-catalyzed cleavage technique. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, all reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. l-Ascorbic acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide were from Sigma. The ECL+plus Western blotting system was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Fc) (catalogue no. S3731), and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) color development substrate were from Promega. AMP-PNP was from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical grade. The H+,K+-ATPase was derived from hog gastric mucosa by previously published methods, using differential and density gradient centrifugation (43Hall K. Perez G. Anderson D. Gutierrez C. Munson K. Hersey S.J. Kaplan J.H. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The vesicles obtained have been shown to be over 90% cytoplasmic side out. The ion impermeability of the vesicles was determined by the difference in K+ stimulation of ATPase activity in the presence of KCl and in the presence of KCl and nigericin. The specific activity in the presence of nigericin was ≈135 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed mg−1 protein h−1, and in the absence of nigericin ≈10 μmol mg−1 h−1. Thus greater than 90% of the K+-stimulated ATPase activity was dependent on the addition of the ionophore, nigericin. Pi released was measured by the method of Yoda and Hokin (44Yoda A. Hokin L.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 40: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and protein concentration by the Lowry method (45Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase was prepared and assayed as described in Ref. 46Jørgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar. The specific activity was 15–20 μmol·mg−1·min−1. Hog gastric microsomal membranes enriched with the gastric H+,K+-ATPase were washed and resuspended at 1 mg/ml in 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 6.8 (E 1 conformation) or 0.1 m RbCl, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.8 (E 2conformation). Freshly prepared ascorbic acid/Tris, pH 7.2, and hydrogen peroxide, each at 10 mm, were added to suspensions of washed membranes (0.25–0.5 mg/ml) and also various concentrations of phosphate, ATP, vanadate, magnesium, AMP-PNP, and EDTA, as indicated in figure legends. The cleavage reaction was initiated by adding FeSO4 at a final concentration of 2–10 μmand incubating at 20 °C for 5–10 min. To stop the reaction, EDTA was added to a final concentration of 20 mm, followed by 5-fold concentrated gel sample buffer (0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 10% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 40% sucrose, and 0.025% bromphenol blue). For defining cleavages mediated by the ATP-Fe2+ complex, the enzyme was pre-incubated in a solution composed of 100 μm FeSO4 with ATP at concentrations between 0.1 and 2 mm and 0.1 mTris·HCl, pH 6.8. Pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase (0.3 mg/ml) was suspended in a medium containing 10 mmTris·HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.1 m RbCl. Cleavage was initiated by adding 2 μm FeSO4 and 10 mmascorbate/H2O2 and incubated for 5 min at 20 °C. The cleavage reaction was stopped by adding 20–50 mm EDTA, and then the 5-fold concentrated gel sample buffer was added at a 1:5 (v/v) dilution. Samples were applied to 1.5-mm-thick 10% (34:1 acrylamide/methylene bisacrylamide) slab gels, using the Tricine buffer method of Schägger and von Jagow (47Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). The gel and running electrophoresis buffers contained 1 mm EDTA. The gel was run for 4–6 h at 70 V constant voltage, and the gel was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes, as described previously (48Besancon M. Shin J.M. Mercier F. Munson K. Miller M. Hersey S. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2345-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Gels included a lane with prestained molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad, 200–14.4 kDa). Anti-Q1030-Y1034, referred to as anti-DQELYY, or antibody 12.18, recognizing residues 681DMDPSEL687 (49Mercier F. Bayle D. Besancon M. Joys T. Shin J.M. Lewin M. Prinz C. Reuben M. Soumarmom A. Wong H. Walsh J. Sachs G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was used for detecting fragments of the H+,K+-ATPase α-subunit, and anti-K1012-Y1016, referred to as anti-KETTY, was used to detect fragments of Na+,K+-ATPase. Immunoblots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+plus kit) using anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate and the protocol supplied with ECL+plus reagents from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or stained by the BCIP/NBT color developing method using anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphate conjugate and the protocol from Promega. Blots were scanned using UMAX, Astra 4000U, or Hewlett Packard HP ScanJet 3200C equipment. The anti-DQELYY, which recognizes the C terminus of the α subunit of H+,K+-ATPase, was raised in rabbits, after coupling the peptide CDQELYY to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Biological Services, Weizmann Institute). The antibody was purified on an affinity column of CDQELYY, prepared by coupling the peptide to a Poros activated affinity chromatography column (epoxide or amino), using a BioCad perfusion chromatography apparatus. The antibody was eluted off the column in a solution of 0.2m Tris·HCl, pH 2, neutralized immediately with Tris base, diluted 1:1 with glycerol, 0.02% sodium azide was added for preservation, and the solution stored at −18 °C until use. Immunoblots of H+,K+-ATPase were probed with anti-DQELYY used at a dilution of 1:1000. For greater ease of understanding of the experimental design and results, the reader is referred to Figs.1 and 2 and Table I. The table contains the homologous sequences of H+,K+-ATPase, Na+,K+-ATPase, or Ca2+-ATPase at or near the cleavage points, the location within the molecule, and theoretical or observed masses of the fragments. The experiments described below demonstrate that the electrophoretic mobility of fragments of H+,K+-ATPase is indistinguishable from that of fragments of Na+,K+-ATPase. The N termini of the latter have been identified, either exactly or to within 4–10 residues, and are referred to as near EWVK (site 2), ESE (site 1), near HFIH (site 2), near DKTGT (site 1), near VAGDA (ATP-Fe2+ site), near MVTGD (site 1), and VNDS (site 1 and ATP-Fe2+ site), respectively (Table I) (26Goldshleger R.

As explained in the text, two minor fragments of Na+,K+-ATPase, with N termini near EWVK (site 2) and near DKTGT (site 1), respectively, were usually not seen with H+,K+-ATPase, and are included here for completeness.

Recent evidence suggests that SR-BI plays a role in atherosclerosis and that inflammatory mediators down-regulate SR-BI in the macrophage. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to down-regulate the activity of the human SR-BI promoter in the macrophage and to delineate the mechanisms involved. Experiments with cultured cells and in vivo derived macrophages showed that LPS has a powerful suppressive effect on SR-BI expression both in vitro and in vivo. Transient transfection studies demonstrated that LPS represses SR-BI promoter activity in the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Cotransfection with either a constitutively active p21-activated protein kinase-1 (PAK1) construct (T423E) or a kinase-deficient PAK1 construct (K299R) resulted in repression of the SR-BI promoter, similar to LPS. These results demonstrate that PAK1-mediated down-regulation of the SR-BI promoter is independent of PAK1 kinase activity and suggest that PAK1 mediates the LPS-induced decrease in promoter activity. Cotransfection with constitutively active Cdc42 or Rac expression constructs also resulted in down-regulation of the promoter; whereas the dominant-negative Cdc42 and Rac constructs elevated basal promoter activity and blunted the LPS response. Cotransfection of PAK1 constructs containing mutations in both the kinase domain and the Cdc42/Rac-binding domain attenuated the PAK1-mediated down-regulation of the promoter, suggesting that Rac and Cdc42 are required for PAK1-mediated decreases in SR-BI promoter activity. 5′-Deletion analysis and gel shift data suggest that LPS inhibits binding of a novel transcription factor to a myeloid zing finger protein-1-like element (−476 to −456) in the human SR-BI promoter. These results demonstrate that the PAK1 pathway down-regulates the SR-BI promoter and suggest that activation of this pathway may play an important role in cholesterol trafficking in the vessel wall.

Although the contribution of SR-BI in the vessel wall to atherogenesis is not known, hepatic overexpression of SR-BI reduces atherosclerosis in low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice fed a high fat diet. Because this effect is associated with reduced plasma high density lipoprotein, it has been suggested that SR-BI enhances hepatic uptake of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and thereby suppresses atherogenesis (10Arai T.

Consistent with this, crossing of SR-BI knockout mice with apoE knockout mice accelerates the onset of atherosclerosis (12Trigatti B. Rayburn H. Vinals M. Braun A. Miettinen H. Penman M. Hertz M.

In addition, modified low density lipoprotein has been shown to increase SR-BI in human monocyte-derived macrophages (8Hirano K. Yamashita S. Nakagawa Y. Ohya T. Matsuura F. Tsukamoto K. Okamoto Y.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8434-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Pro-inflammatory mediators such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have also been shown to down-regulate the mRNA and protein levels of SR-BI in the monocyte and macrophage (16Buechler C. Ritter M. Quoc C.D. Agildere A. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite a number of studies demonstrating regulation of SR-BI, relatively little is known about the basic mechanisms involved. Recent promoter studies have shown that members of the Sp1 transcription factor family are essential for transcription of the rat SR-BI gene in mouse Leydig tumor cells (17Mizutani T. Yamada K. Minegishi T. Miyamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22512-22519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the sterol response element-binding protein activates transcription of the rat SR-BI promoter in variety of cell lines (18Lopez D. McLean M.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5669-5681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that steroidogenic factor-1 binds to and activates the human SR-BI promoter in mouse adrenocortical cells (6Cao G. Garcia C.K.

More recently, it was shown that the ligand-activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor increases SR-BI expression in human monocytes and macrophages (9Chinetti G. Gbaguidi F.G. Griglio S.

Circulation. 2000; 101: 2411-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar).The observation that pro-inflammatory stimuli such as LPS repress SR-BI expression has led to the hypothesis that inflammatory mediators contribute to atherogenesis by compromising cholesterol efflux from vascular macrophages. LPS is known to signal through Toll-like receptor-4 (19Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F. J. Biol.

In addition, LPS has been shown to activate p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1) in the macrophage, and PAK1 activation triggers nuclear accumulation of NF-κB (25Frost J.A. Swantek J.L. Stippec S. Yin M.J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), is activated by the Rho family GTP-binding proteins Rac1 and Cdc42 (27Manser E. Leung T.

Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Activation of these GTPases is induced by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, which catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP (29Cherfils J. Chardin P. Trends Biochem.

In addition to activation, guanine nucleotide exchange factors may regulate downstream signaling events of Rac1 and Cdc42 (30Zhou K. Wang Y. Gorski J.L. Nomura N. Collard J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

These downstream signaling events include activation of many of the same pathways induced by LPS such as the JNK and p38 kinases (31Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N.

Although Rac1 and Cdc42 have multiple effectors, the Rac1- and Cdc42-mediated increase in p38 activity is dependent on PAK1 (32Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G. Ulevitch R.J.

Thus, there is accumulating evidence in the literature that the PAK1 pathway plays an important role in LPS-mediated signal transduction.Many studies have suggested a role for PAK1 in cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility (34Adam L.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and several physiologic signals such as thrombin, insulin, and epidermal growth factor have been reported to activate PAKs (28Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 38Teo M. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol.

In this work, we studied the role of the Cdc42/Rac/PAK1 pathway in the LPS-induced regulation of the SR-BI promoter in macrophage RAW 264.7 cells.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have documented SR-BI expression in human monocytes and macrophages (2Murao K. Terpstra V. Green S.R. Kondratenko N. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17551-17557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 8Hirano K. Yamashita S.

Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that LPS down-regulates SR-BI mRNA and protein levels in monocytes and macrophages (16Buechler C. Ritter M. Quoc C.D. Agildere A. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The results in this study confirm these in vitro findings and demonstrate for the first time that LPS down-regulates SR-BI protein levels in macrophages in vivo. The finding in this study that LPS decreases SR-BI promoter activity in RAW 264.7 cells provided a system to begin elucidating the signaling pathways involved in LPS regulation of the SR-BI promoter in macrophage cells.Although LPS signaling is complex and not completely understood, it has been shown to involve activation of PAK1 and to lead to nuclear accumulation of NF-κB in RAW 264.7 cells (25Frost J.A. Swantek J.L. Stippec S. Yin M.J. Gaynor R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19693-19699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The results presented in this study show that PAK1 inhibits SR-BI promoter activity and suggest that LPS-mediated reduction in SR-BI promoter activity is mediated by the PAK1 pathway. Importantly, PAK1 inhibition of the SR-BI promoter was shown to be independent of PAK1 kinase activity since expression of either constitutively active or kinase-deficient PAK1 resulted in a similar decrease in promoter activity. Several studies have demonstrated kinase-independent effects of PAK1 on cytoskeletal regulation (36Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 37Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 43Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar); however, the kinase-independent effect of PAK1 on transcriptional regulation observed in this study is novel. Recent studies showed that PAK1 up-regulates the vascular endothelial growth factor promoter in MCF-7 cells. The vascular endothelial growth factor promoter results provide additional evidence that PAK1 can alter transcriptional regulation; however, this regulation was shown to be dependent on the kinase activity of PAK1 (44Bagheri-Yarmand R. Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39451-39457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recent studies provide evidence that the kinase-independent effects of PAK1 are due to protein-protein interactions that occur upon recruitment of PAK1 to the plasma membrane. The kinase-independent effect of PAK1 on neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells requires targeting of PAK1 to the plasma membrane and is dependent on structural features in both the N- and C-terminal domains of the molecule (43Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In addition, PAKs have been demonstrated to interact with a variety of proteins at the plasma membrane such as the Cool/Pix proteins (45Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 46Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Our results support the previous findings of kinase-independent effects of PAK1 and furthermore demonstrate that these effects can alter transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.The importance of protein-protein interactions for PAK1 activity was also documented in this study. The results show that the PAK1-mediated reduction in SR-BI promoter activity was dependent on Rac and Cdc42 since PAK1 mutants unable to bind these GTPases had significantly less activity than the PAK1 mutants with intact GTPase-binding domains. Although Cdc42 and Rac are known to trigger the kinase activity of PAK1 (27Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar), our results indicate that these GTPases have an additional role in mediating the effects of PAK1 on SR-BI transcriptional regulation perhaps through recruitment of PAK1 to the plasma membrane. Additional evidence that Rac and Cdc42 were intimately involved in the down-regulation of SR-BI promoter activity was shown by the significant decreases in promoter activity in cells transfected with the constitutively active GTPases. Furthermore, the dominant-negative Rac and Cdc42 proteins blocked the LPS-mediated reduction in SR-BI promoter activity and elevated the basal activity of the promoter. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a role for Cdc42, Rac, and PAK1 in the LPS-mediated decrease in SR-BI promoter activity. The kinase-independent effects shown in this study in conjunction with the observations noted by others suggest a model for PAK1 “activation” in which the function of PAK1 is determined by both the kinase activity of the enzyme and, perhaps more importantly, the assembly of signaling complexes.The observation that LPS inhibits SR-BI promoter activity suggests that two basic mechanisms may be involved. LPS either results in a loss of transcriptionally active DNA-protein interactions or leads to formation of repressive DNA-protein complexes. Gel shift analyses of the LPS-responsive region as defined by 5′-deletion constructs suggested that LPS inhibited binding of transcriptional activators to the SR-BI promoter rather than leading to formation of repressive DNA-protein interactions. Gel shift experiments narrowed the putative LPS-responsive region of the human SR-BI promoter to −476 to −456. Importantly, the steroidogenic factor-1 site previously demonstrated to regulate human SR-BI promoter activity in adrenocortical cells (6Cao G. Garcia C.K. Wyne K.L. Schultz R.A. Parker K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33068-33076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) is located at positions −218 to −212 and does not appear to be a major mediator of basal transcriptional activity in RAW 264.7 cells, as significant decreases in basal activity were observed in the construct containing the steroidogenic factor-1 site (−255 to −157). Together, these observations indicate that transcriptional regulation of SR-BI is cell type-dependent.Transcription factor data base analysis of the putative LPS-responsive region indicated that an MZF-1-like element was involved; and indeed, a point mutation in this element at position −464 mimicked the LPS-induced decrease in protein binding to the region. However, MZF-1 consensus probes were unable to compete for binding, suggesting that the MZF-1 protein was not a component of the DNA-protein complex inhibited by LPS. Given that this LPS-responsive region is G-rich, characteristic of Sp1-binding sites, and that Sp1 has been implicated in transcription of the rat SR-BI promoter (17Mizutani T. Yamada K. Minegishi T. Miyamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22512-22519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that the LPS-responsive region was binding the Sp1 protein. However, gel shift competition assays with an Sp1 consensus probe indicated that Sp1 was not a member of the protein complex disrupted by LPS. In addition, experiments ruled out roles for AP-1 and NF-κB in the LPS-mediated reduction in promoter activity. Together, these results suggest that a novel transcription factor binds to −476 to −456 of the human SR-BI promoter and drives basal transcription in the macrophage. In addition, these results suggest that LPS disrupts binding of this factor, thereby inhibiting SR-BI transcription. Indeed, a point mutation in the MZF-1-like element, although not abolishing the LPS response, did reduce the LPS response, suggesting that the LPS effect is due in part to the MZF-1-like element. Further experiments are needed to determine the nature of the factor binding to the MZF-1-like element and to decipher additional LPS-responsive regions in the SR-BI promoter.Although the extracellular milieu in an atherosclerotic plaque is complex, thus exposing foam cells to a multitude of stimuli, recent studies in platelets provide further evidence that PAK1 may be an important physiologic regulator of SR-BI in the atherosclerotic vessel. The coagulation protease, thrombin, has been shown to activate PAK1 in platelets (38Teo M. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26690-26697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, ligation of the thrombin protease-activated receptor (PAR-1) is known to activate Cdc42 and Rac in platelets (47Azim A.C. Barkalow K. Chou J. Hartwig J.H. Blood. 2000; 95: 959-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the thrombin receptor has been detected in macrophages (48Abraham L.A. Jenkins A.L. Stone S.R. Mackie E.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 818-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and thrombin is likely present in the atherosclerotic vessel wall. These observations raise the possibility that thrombin-induced activation of PAK1 may be an important physiologic mechanism of SR-BI regulation in the foam cell and warrant further exploration into the role of PAK1 activity in cholesterol homeostasis in the atherosclerotic vessel wall.In summary, we have documented that LPS and the PAK1 pathway down-regulate human SR-BI promoter activity in the macrophage. These results support the hypothesis that inflammatory mediators exacerbate foam cell formation via down-regulation of the SR-BI receptor in the macrophage.

https://openalex.org/W1977969194,"In this study, we have used multiple strategies to characterize the mechanisms of the type I and type II RNA cleavage activities harbored by the Flp (pronounced here as “flip”) site-specific DNA recombinase (Flp-RNase I and II, respectively). Reactions using half-sites pre-bound by step-arrest mutants of Flp agree with a “shared active site” being responsible for the type I reaction (as is the case with normal DNA recombination). In a “pre-cleaved” type I substrate containing a 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond, the Flp-RNase I activity can be elicited by either wild type Flp or by Flp(Y343F). Kinetic analyses of the type I reaction are consistent with the above observations and support the notion that the DNA recombinase and type I RNase active sites are identical. The type II RNase activity is expressed by Flp(Y343F) in a half-site substrate and is unaffected by the catalytic constitution of a Flp monomer present on a partner half-site. Reaction conditions that proscribe the assembly of a DNA bound Flp dimer have no effect on Flp-RNase II. These biochemical results, together with kinetic data, are consistent with the reaction being performed from a “non-shared active site” contained within a single Flp monomer. The Flp-related recombinase Cre, which utilizes a non-shared recombination active site, exhibits the type I RNA cleavage reaction. So far, we have failed to detect the type II RNase activity in Cre. Despite their differences in active site assembly, Cre functionally mimics Flp in being able to provide two functional active sites from a trimer of Cre bound to a three-armed (Y-shaped) substrate.

Full-Text PDF Open Access base pair N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine bis(acetoxyethoxy)-methyl ether substituent cleavage product The yeast site-specific recombinase Flp is encoded by the 2-μm circle, a highly persistent, multicopy extrachromosomal DNA element found in most strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (reviewed in Ref. 1Broach J.R.

The Flp recombination system is believed to play a critical role in safeguarding the plasmid against downward fluctuations in its copy number (2Futcher A.B. J. Theor. Biol. 1986; 119: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 3Futcher B. Reid E. Hickey D.A. Genetics. 1988; 118: 411-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Volkert F.C. Broach J.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Based on the chemistry of recombination and the active site residues involved in the reaction (5Jayaram M. Grainge I. Tribble G. Berg D. Mobile DNA II. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2001Google Scholar, 6Grainge I. Jayaram M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), Flp has been assigned to the integrase/tyrosine family of recombinases. Members of this family carry out DNA exchange with the help of four recombinase monomers acting in unison. One round of recombination is completed in two temporally distinct chemical steps, each step exchanging one pair of strands between the DNA partners. A Holliday junction is therefore an obligatory intermediate in the reaction. The recently solved structure of the Flp-Holliday junction complex (7Chen Y. Narendra U. Iype L.E. Cox M.M. Rice P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reveals close similarities to the structures of related complexes formed by the phage P1 recombinase Cre (8Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 9Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to suppose that the functional DNA-protein assemblies formed at the core recombination sites by all members of the integrase/tyrosine family have nearly identical geometry and topology. Despite the differences in their primary amino acid sequences, the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domains of Flp and Cre have roughly the same three-dimensional folds. This similarity also extends to the catalytic domain of human and vaccinia topoisomerase I proteins (10Shuman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,11Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). This is not surprising because Flp and Cre utilize the basic type IB topoisomerase mechanism for strand cutting and joining. The active site nucleophiles in Flp and Cre (Tyr-343 and Tyr-324, respectively) form 3′-phosphotyrosyl bonds during the DNA cleavage reaction. The 5′-hydroxyl groups generated by cleavage provide the active nucleophiles for the strand exchange step. They attack the phosphotyrosyl bonds across DNA partners to bring about strand joining in the recombinant mode. In addition to the invariant tyrosine nucleophile, the active sites of Flp and Cre include a conserved catalytic pentad consisting of two arginines, a lysine, a histidine, and a tryptophan (7Chen Y. Narendra U. Iype L.E. Cox M.M. Rice P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 885-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Esposito D. Scocca J.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In Flp, the pentad residues correspond to Arg-191, Lys-223, His-305, Arg-308, and Trp-330 (RKHRW). There is one important difference, however, between Flp and Cre in the manner in which the pentad cluster and the tyrosine nucleophile are utilized during active site assembly. In Cre, all active site residues are provided by a single monomer so that the catalytic tyrosine attacks the scissile phosphodiester bond immediately adjacent to the DNA-bound Cre monomer. This mode of DNA cleavage has been termed cleavage incis. In Flp, the tyrosine is delivered across the 8-bp1 strand exchange region (or spacer) to effect cleavage in trans at the distal scissile phosphodiester bond. Thus, the Flp active site assembled on the FRT (Flp RecombinationTarget) DNA is a “shared” one. The monomer bound to one side of the spacer shares its pentad moiety with the Tyr-343 residue of the monomer bound on the opposite side. The catalytically active entity of Flp is a recombinase dimer positioned on the left and right binding elements flanking the spacer DNA (14Voziyanov Y. Lee J. Whang I. Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 720-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Voziyanov Y. Pathania S. Jayaram M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 930-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Even in Cre, the reactivity of the cis-acting monomer is dependent on its allosteric activation via contacts made by the second monomer on the far side of the spacer (8Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Although Flp is a DNA recombinase, it harbors two types of cryptic RNA cleavage activities, type I and type II, that can be exposed by providing it substrates containing appropriate ribonucleotide substitutions (16Xu C.J. Ahn Y.T. Pathania S. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30591-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17Xu C.J. Grainge I. Lee J. Harshey R.M. Jayaram M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The type I activity (also called Flp-RNase I) attacks the same phosphodiester bond that normally takes part in DNA recombination and is absolutely dependent on Tyr-343. However, whether the reaction proceeds via a covalent 3′-phosphotyrosyl intermediate has not been established. A similar activity, with a minor distinction, has been observed with vaccinia topoisomerase I as well (18Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 89-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The final product of the type I cleavage reaction contains a 3′-phosphate in the case of Flp, whereas it is a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate in the case of the vaccinia enzyme. The type II reaction of Flp is peculiar in that the phosphodiester bond that it uniquely targets is the 3′ neighbor of the one involved in DNA recombination. Furthermore, the reaction does not require Tyr-343. The final product of the Flp-RNase II reaction also contains a 3′-phosphate. We have applied biochemical and kinetic strategies in conjunction with synthetic type I and type II substrates of specially designed configurations to understand further the mechanisms of the two Flp-RNase activities. We have also probed the Cre recombinase to test the generality of the existence of cryptic RNase active sites within the integrase/tyrosine family. We have revealed the type I RNase activity in Cre but have failed to detect the type II RNase activity. It is possible that this difference may be related to the contrasting modes of active site assembly, cis versus trans, employed by Cre and Flp, respectively. Despite this distinction, a trimer of Cre organized on a three-armed DNA substrate (or a Y junction) can provide two functional active sites required for its resolution. This outcome is identical to what has been previously observed with Flp in substrates of similar geometry (19Lee J. Whang I. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 532-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Qian X.H. Cox M.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2053-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that the majority of the assays employed in this study utilize non-standard substrates as follows: half-sites, bulged full-sites, and three armed “Y” substrates. Their features are schematically diagrammed in the figures and explained in the legends. Note that a half-site substrate contains only one recombinase-binding element and one scissile phosphodiester bond proximal to it. By contrast, a full-site contains two recombinase-binding elements arranged in head to head fashion on either side of the spacer. It is helpful to keep in mind that the association of two Flp-bound half-sites would permit the assembly of a shared active site. Wild type Flp, variants of Flp, Cre, and Cre(Y324F) used in this study were purified as described previously (19Lee J. Whang I. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 532-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Tribble G. Ahn Y.T. Lee J. Dandekar T. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22255-22267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated from densitometric scans of aliquots of Flp, Cre, or their variants fractionated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Known amounts of bovine serum albumin, similarly fractionated and stained, provided the standard. Synthetic hybrid oligonucleotides containing ribose substitutions at specific positions were obtained from Oligos Etc. Wilsonville, OR, or from Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO. Standard deoxynucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA. All oligonucleotide preparations were gel-purified, and the substrates were assembled by hybridization between pairs of oligonucleotides as described previously (19Lee J. Whang I. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 532-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The 5′ ends of the oligonucleotides were radioactively labeled using [γ-32P]ATP in a T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction. The 3′ ends were labeled with 3′-α-32P-cordycepin 5′-triphosphate using the terminal deoxynucleotidetransferase reaction. Excess ATP or cordycepin phosphate was removed by spin dialysis on a Sephadex G-25 column prior to hybridization. The Flp substrates used for this study were either the same as those described earlier (16Xu C.J. Ahn Y.T. Pathania S. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30591-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17Xu C.J. Grainge I. Lee J. Harshey R.M. Jayaram M. Mol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3061-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or their derivatives. Their relevant features are outlined in the figures and described in the text. The Cre substrates were modeled after their Flp counterparts. They contained the Cre binding sequence 5′ATAACTTCGTATAA3′/3′TATTGAAGCATATT5′. The complete sequences of individual substrates will be made available to any one who is interested. The hairpin substrates were obtained as pre-made oligonucleotides or by carrying out Flp recombination in the desired half-site substrates. In the latter procedure, a half-site was incubated with wild type Flp under standard recombination conditions for 30 min at 30 °C to generate the recombinant hairpin product. It was separated by electrophoresis in a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide, 50% urea), visualized by autoradiography, excised from the gel and extracted overnight in Flp reaction buffer at 4 °C. The hairpin obtained by Flp recombination or the hairpin forming synthetic oligonucleotide was heated to 90 °C and cooled to room temperature to ensure proper annealing of the complementary bases before reaction with Flp or Flp(Y343F). A “pre-cleaved” RNase I half-site substrate was generated as follows. A Flp-RNase I half-site was first assembled with its reactive 2′-hydroxyl group blocked by a bis(acetoxyethoxy)-methyl ether substituent (2′-ACE protection). Furthermore the substrate was inactivated in strand transfer by phosphorylation of the 5′-OH group of the strand that is not subject to cleavage by Flp. This substrate was cleaved by tyramine in the presence of Flp(Y343F) to generate the 3′-O-phosphotyramine intermediate (23Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17564-17570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following cleavage, the 2′-protecting group was removed by incubation in 100 mmTEMED acetate (pH 3.8) at 50 °C for 30 min. The deprotected, tyramine-linked strand was isolated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was then hybridized to its partner deoxyoligonucleotide using standard procedures. All reactions were performed as described by Chen et al. (24Chen J.-W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 647-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The DNA substrates (0.05–0.10 pmol) were incubated with ∼0.4–0.8 pmol of Flp or Flp(Y343F) for 30 min at 30 °C in standard Flp recombination buffer. The reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS (0.2% final concentration). The samples were chloroform/phenol-extracted and EtOH-precipitated prior to electrophoresis in 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide to bisacrylamide; 50% urea). The radioactive bands were identified by autoradiography or by PhosphorImaging. It should be pointed out that, during assays of Flp-RNase activities, samples were not treated with proteinase K prior to chloroform/phenol extraction. The covalent cleavage complex formed between the substrate and wild type Flp protein was thus eliminated from the aqueous phase and did not interfere with the Flp-RNase cleavage bands during subsequent analysis. In certain experiments that monitored covalent DNA cleavage by Flp, the proteinase K treatment was included (24Chen J.-W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 647-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The reactions were performed essentially as described by Chen et al. (24Chen J.-W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 647-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The unlabeled DNA half-site (0.01–0.02 pmol) and the radioactively labeled Flp-RNase half-site (0.01–0.02 pmol) were incubated separately with ∼0.05 pmol of the appropriate Flp variant for 10 min on ice. Approximately 0.5–0.1 pmol each of the respective unlabeled half-sites was added to each incubation mixture, and the two were quickly combined into a reaction tube maintained at 30 °C. After incubation at this temperature for 15 min, reactions were stopped by addition of SDS (0.2% final), and DNA was recovered by chloroform/phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Further analysis was performed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (or PhosphorImaging) as described earlier. The steady state kinetic experiments were carried out at a fixed concentration of the substrate (0.0087 μm) and varying concentrations of wild type Flp or Flp(Y343F). In the assays for obtaining the Lineweaver-Burk plots, the protein concentration was maintained higher relative to substrate concentration. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C. Product yields were linear up to 20 min under these conditions. In the temperature dependence experiments, the incubation time was 10 min at each temperature. The binding reactions were done using Cre(Y324F) under conditions that had been previously used for Flp (19Lee J. Whang I. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 532-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Lee J. Tribble G. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The DNA bound complexes were resolved by electrophoresis in an 8% native polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide to bisacrylamide, 29:1). The resolution assays with the Y junction substrates and Cre and RNA cleavage assays with half-site substrates and Cre or Cre(Y324F) were also done under conditions previously described for similar assays with Flp (17Xu C.J. Grainge I. Lee J. Harshey R.M. Jayaram M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,19Lee J. Whang I. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 532-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For clarity and uniformity, the following conventions are followed in schematically depicting the various half-site substrates used for type I or type II Flp-RNase assays. The “top strand” (arbitrarily designated as the one containing the scissile phosphodiester bond) is represented by a bold line. The complementary “bottom strand” is drawn as a thin line. The relevant nucleotide bases present in the Flp-binding element and in the spacer are shown byupper and lowercase letters, respectively. A ribonucleotide in the binding element or the spacer is denoted by abold letter with an attached OH. The 5′ and 3′ ends of each strand are indicated, and a radioactive end label (when present) is denoted by an asterisk. The unlabeled DNA half-site used in assays containing a pair of Flp variants is not a source of cleavage products relevant to this study. Representation of the hairpin substrates follows the same rules as the half-site substrates. Two phosphodiester positions in the half-site substrates are of significance to the experiments described below. The first one is located immediately 3′ to the terminal C of the Flp-binding element that abuts the spacer segment (indicated by p in Fig.1, A and B). The second one is the immediate 3′ neighbor of the first and is 3′-linked to the first spacer nucleotide (p′ in Fig.5 A).Figure 5Flp RNase II activity; action on half-site and hairpin substrates. A, the plausible reaction pathway for Flp-RNase II is outlined. This activity is directed to the scissile phosphate, p′. The reaction is believed to be initiated by a direct attack by the vicinal 2′-hydroxyl group.B, the binary half-site reactions contained an unlabeled DNA half-site (HS-D) and the labeled Type II half-site (HS-R2), each pre-bound by an indicated Flp variant. The bottom strand of HS-R 2 contained a phosphate at the 5′ end.C, the all DNA hairpin was labeled at the 3′ end; the type II hairpin was labeled at the 5′ end. The product of Flp-RNase II cleavage is CP2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For the bulge containing Flp full-sites, as they are drawn here, the top strand (shown in bold) is defined as the one containing the scissile phosphodiester bond at the left end of the spacer. The bottom strand, containing the scissile phosphodiester bond at the right end of the spacer, is drawn as a thin line. In the lox half-sites (substrates for Cre), the target phosphate for the type I Cre-RNase is indicated by p and is immediately to the 5′ side of the strand exchange segment. The neighboring base on the 5′ side is an A. The bases that form part of the strand exchange region during Cre recombination (equivalent to the Flp spacer segment) are written in lowercase letters. The target phosphate for the putative Cre-RNase II, based on the corresponding Flp activity, is indicated as p′. The currently favored mechanism for the type I Flp-RNase activity proposes a 3′-phosphotyrosyl intermediate for the reaction (Fig. 1, A and B). This covalent linkage between Flp and the nucleic acid backbone results from nucleophilic attack by the catalytic tyrosine (Tyr-343) of Flp on the scissile phosphodiester bond that is normally involved in DNA recombination (indicated as p in Fig. 1, A andB). Upon cleavage of a half-site substrate by Tyr-343, the short spacer segment of the cleaved strand will dissociate and diffuse away. The 5′-hydroxyl group of the other strand can then attack the phosphotyrosyl bond to give a hairpin recombinant (Fig. 1 A). The strand joining step of the reaction can be mediated efficiently by Flp(Y343F), even though it is inactive in cleavage. During recombination, a functional Flp cleavage pocket is assembled from a “pro-active site” containing the RKHRW catalytic pentad (Arg-191, Lys-223, His-305, Arg-308, and Trp-330) provided by one Flp monomer and Tyr-343 delivered in trans by a partner Flp monomer. As a result, a Flp point mutant in the pentad cluster can complement Flp(Y343F) in a half-site recombination reaction (24Chen J.-W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 647-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Chen J.W. Yang S.H. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14417-14425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Chen et al. (24Chen J.-W. Lee J. Jayaram M. Cell. 1992; 69: 647-658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) experiments tested Flp substituents at Arg-191, His-305, Arg-308, and Tyr-343 individually and in all possible pairwise combinations. The outcomes showed that the single mutants as well as the binary combinations among mutants of the pentad residues are inactive in half-site cleavage (and hairpin formation). However, Flp(Y343F) can be rescued in half-site recombination by pairing it with each mutant of the pentad class. According to the model in Fig.1 B, the type I RNase activity of Flp may be expressed when the half-site contains a vicinal 2′-hydroxyl group that can attack the 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond formed by the action of Tyr-343 intrans. If the type I Flp-RNase is a variation of the basic DNA recombination mechanism, two predictions follow. First, pairwise combinations of the Flp pentad mutants with Flp(Y343F) should elicit this activity. Second, the RNase cleavage should occur only on the half-site bound by Flp(Y343F), which is the recipient of Tyr-343 from the pentad mutant. Results of an assay that test these predictions are shown in Fig.1 C. One of the substrates used in these assays was an unlabeled DNA half-site (HS-D) that is not subject to Flp-RNase I cleavage. The second substrate (HS-R1) contained a ribo-C as the terminal nucleotide of the Flp-binding element abutting the spacer and is a substrate for Flp-RNase I. The radioactive label placed at the 5′ end of the cleavage strand in HS-R1 permitted the detection of Flp-RNase cleavage and Flp recombination products. Reactions inlanes 2–4 of Fig. 1 C were done by pre-binding Flp(Y343F) to HS-R1 and Flp(R191S), Flp(R308G), or Flp(H305L) to HS-D and then mixing the two complexes in recombination buffer (26Chen J.W. Yang S.H. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14417-14425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In each reaction with this binary protein combination, the half-site recombination product (R) and the Flp-RNase I cleavage product (CP1) were formed. When the protein-half-site partners were switched (Flp(Y343F) now being bound to HS-D), half-site recombination and Flp-RNase I activity were reduced to barely detectable levels (Fig.1 C, lanes 5–7). The very faint bands of R and CP1 inlanes 5–7 were likely because of some recycling of the Flp variants on the half-site substrates. The results of the complementation assay are consistent with the scheme proposed in Fig. 1 B. In the composite Flp-RNase I active site, the orientation of the scissile phosphodiester is achieved by one Flp monomer, and Tyr-343 is provided by the second Flp monomer. The phosphotyrosyl intermediate formed by strand cleavage may be attacked in the second step of the reaction either by the vicinal 2′-hydroxyl group (Flp-RNase I; Fig. 1 B) or the 5′-hydroxyl group from the opposite strand (half-site recombination; Fig. 1 A). One important criterion for the validity of the reaction scheme in Fig.1 B is the demonstration that Flp-RNase I is able to hydrolyze the predicted 3′-O-phosphoryl intermediate to the 3′-phosphate product. Although isolation of the cleaved DNA intermediate of recombination is straightforward (23Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17564-17570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Knudsen B.R. Dahlstrom K. Westergaard O. Jayaram M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), attempts to obtain the corresponding cleavage product with the Flp-RNase I substrate have not been successful. Hence a structural or non-covalent catalytic role for Tyr-343 during the Flp-RNase I reaction cannot be ruled out. Alternatively, the presumed intermediate has a very short lifetime because of the reactivity of the neighboring 2′-hydroxyl group and does not accumulate during the reaction. We have circumvented this problem by protecting the 2′-hydroxyl group during the initial tyrosine cleavage step. The protecting agent was a bis(acetoxyethoxy)-methyl ether substituent (2′-ACE protection) (28Scrainge S.A. Wincott F.E. Caruthers M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11820-11821Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In reality, we used tyramine as the cleavage nucleophile assisted by Flp(Y343F) according to the reaction protocol described by Lee and Jayaram (23Lee J. Jayaram M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17564-17570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig.2, A and B). The strand containing the covalently linked tyramine was gel-purified and, after removal of the 2′-protecting group at low pH, it was hybridized to the bottom strand to obtain the pre-cleaved half-site used for the assays shown in Fig. 2 C. Further details of the methodology are given under “Materials and Methods.” Cleavage of the DNA half-site by tyramine in the presence of Flp(Y343F) gave the tyramine-linked product (CP-Tyr; lane 2 of Fig.2 A), which provides a convenient marker band during electrophoresis of reaction products. A similar reaction with the “protected type I half-site substrate” gave two prominent cleavage bands (lane 2 of Fig. 2 B). One of these corresponded to the Flp-RNase I product CP1 (lane 2 of Fig.2 B) and indicates the level of the deprotected substrate contaminant in the reaction. The second band ([rCP-Tyr]*,lane 2 of Fig. 2 B) migrated slightly above CP-Tyr (compare lanes 2 of Fig. 2, A and B), as would be consistent with the presence of the protecting group at the 2′-position. Following removal of the 2′-ACE moiety, its mobility shifted to"
