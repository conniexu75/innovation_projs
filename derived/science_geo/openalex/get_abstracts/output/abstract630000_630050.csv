Such processing typically requires complex systems of bulk optical elements such as lenses, filters, and mirrors. Mohammadi Estakhri et al. demonstrate that specially designed nanophotonic structures can take input waveforms encoded as complex mathematical functions, manipulate them, and provide an output that is the integral of the functions. The results, demonstrated for microwaves, provide a route to develop chip-based analog optical computers and computing elements. Science , this issue p. 1333"
https://openalex.org/W2925075625,"Single-cell RNA sequencing studies of differentiating systems have raised fundamental questions regarding the discrete versus continuous nature of both differentiation and cell fate. Here we present Palantir, an algorithm that models trajectories of differentiating cells by treating cell fate as a probabilistic process and leverages entropy to measure cell plasticity along the trajectory. Palantir generates a high-resolution pseudo-time ordering of cells and, for each cell state, assigns a probability of differentiating into each terminal state. We apply our algorithm to human bone marrow single-cell RNA sequencing data and detect important landmarks of hematopoietic differentiation. Palantir's resolution enables the identification of key transcription factors that drive lineage fate choice and closely track when cells lose plasticity. We show that Palantir outperforms existing algorithms in identifying cell lineages and recapitulating gene expression trends during differentiation, is generalizable to diverse tissue types, and is well-suited to resolving less-studied differentiating systems."
https://openalex.org/W2922809418,"Excessive consumption of beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is associated with obesity and with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Whether HFCS contributes directly to tumorigenesis is unclear. We investigated the effects of daily oral administration of HFCS in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutant mice, which are predisposed to develop intestinal tumors. The HFCS-treated mice showed a substantial increase in tumor size and tumor grade in the absence of obesity and metabolic syndrome. HFCS increased the concentrations of fructose and glucose in the intestinal lumen and serum, respectively, and the tumors transported both sugars. Within the tumors, fructose was converted to fructose-1-phosphate, leading to activation of glycolysis and increased synthesis of fatty acids that support tumor growth. These mouse studies support the hypothesis that the combination of dietary glucose and fructose, even at a moderate dose, can enhance tumorigenesis."

However, this is not possible for prepubertal boys. Fayomi et al. grafted cryopreserved testicular tissue from castrated pubertal rhesus macaques, placing each animal's own testis sections under the skin of the back or scrotum (see the Perspective by Neuhaus and Schlatt). Grafts grew, produced testosterone, and were able to generate sperm that could fertilize oocytes, in one case resulting in a successful pregnancy. The results hold promise for preserving human fertility, for example, after childhood cancer treatments. Science , this issue p. 1314 ; see also p. 1283"

https://openalex.org/W2923832950,"Direct methane functionalization to value-added products remains a challenge because of the propensity for overoxidation in many reaction environments. Sulfonation has emerged as an attractive approach for achieving the necessary selectivity. Here, we report a practical process for the production of methanesulfonic acid (MSA) from only two reactants: methane and sulfur trioxide. We have achieved >99% selectivity and yield of MSA. The electrophilic initiator based on a sulfonyl peroxide derivative is protonated under superacidic conditions, producing a highly electrophilic oxygen atom capable of activating a C-H bond of methane. Mechanistic studies support the formation of CH3+ as a key intermediate. This method is readily scalable with reactors connected in series for prospective production of up to 20 metric tons per year of MSA."
https://openalex.org/W2942797094,"The Google Books Ngram Viewer (Google Ngram) is a search engine that charts word frequencies from a large corpus of books and thereby allows for the examination of cultural change as it is reflected in books. While the tool’s massive corpus of data (about 8 million books or 6% of all books ever published) has been used in various scientific studies, concerns about the accuracy of results have simultaneously emerged. This paper reviews the literature and serves as a guideline for improving Google Ngram studies by suggesting five methodological procedures suited to increase the reliability of results. In particular, we recommend the use of (I) different language corpora, (II) cross-checks on different corpora from the same language, (III) word inflections, (IV) synonyms, and (V) a standardization procedure that accounts for both the influx of data and unequal weights of word frequencies. Further, we outline how to combine these procedures and address the risk of potential biases arising from censorship and propaganda. As an example of the proposed procedures, we examine the cross-cultural expression of religion via religious terms for the years 1900 to 2000. Special emphasis is placed on the situation during World War II. In line with the strand of literature that emphasizes the decline of collectivistic values, our results suggest an overall decrease of religion’s importance. However, religion re-gains importance during times of crisis such as World War II. By comparing the results obtained through the different methods, we illustrate that applying and particularly combining our suggested procedures increase the reliability of results and prevents authors from deriving wrong assumptions."
https://openalex.org/W2924598282,"Faculty members face demands such as research, outreach programs, and management activities. Such demands may expose faculty to burnout. Burnout affects the physical, psychological and social health of faculty members, but it is still unclear how it affects their quality of life. We aimed to assess the impact of burnout on the quality of life (QoL) of faculty members from different fields of knowledge.Cross-sectional study using validated tools for measuring burnout and QoL (Oldenburg Burnout Inventory-OLBI and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Abbreviated version-WHOQOL-Bref) in a sample of 366 faculty members from a public university. Scores were analyzed using Student's t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), binary logistic regression, and structural equation modeling (SEM).More than a third of the faculty members (n = 127; 36.6%) suffered from burnout. Men had higher scores of quality of life than women in the physical health (p = 0.001; d<0.5), psychological (p = 0.001; d<0.5) and social relationships (p = 0.048; d<0.5) domains. Women were more exhausted than men (p = 0.001; d<0.5). Faculty members' perception of quality of life and burnout did not differ according to their field of knowledge (p>0.05). Participants who felt tired before arriving at work were less likely to report good quality of life (OR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.21-0.99). Faculty members who stated they needed more time to relax after work were less likely to be satisfied with their health (OR = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.10-0.40). Burnout showed a negative association with quality of life (λ = 0.87; p < 0,001; df = 8).Burnout negatively affects faculty members' quality of life, regardless of their field of knowledge. Our results suggest the implementation of programs and actions to prevent burnout to faculty members, especially to women, as their quality of life may affect the quality of the education provided."
https://openalex.org/W2937386439,"Working memory is the ability to perform mental operations on information that is stored in a flexible, limited capacity buffer. The ability to manipulate information in working memory is central to many aspects of human cognition, but also declines with healthy aging. Given the profound importance of such working memory manipulation abilities, there is a concerted effort towards developing approaches to improve them. The current study tested the capacity to enhance working memory manipulation with online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy young and older adults. Online high frequency (5Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to test the hypothesis that active repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation would lead to significant improvements in memory recall accuracy compared to sham stimulation, and that these effects would be most pronounced in working memory manipulation conditions with the highest cognitive demand in both young and older adults. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied while participants were performing a delayed response alphabetization task with three individually-titrated levels of difficulty. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was identified by combining electric field modeling to individualized functional magnetic resonance imaging activation maps and was targeted during the experiment using stereotactic neuronavigation with real-time robotic guidance, allowing optimal coil placement during the stimulation. As no accuracy differences were found between young and older adults, the results from both groups were collapsed. Subsequent analyses revealed that active stimulation significantly increased accuracy relative to sham stimulation, but only for the hardest condition. These results point towards further investigation of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for memory enhancement focusing on high difficulty conditions as those most likely to exhibit benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2923373128,"Brucellosis is a major public health problem still prevalent as a neglected endemic zoonosis requiring proactive attention in many communities worldwide. The present study involved analysis of Brucella field strains submitted for typing to the Italian National Reference Laboratory for Brucellosis from 2007 to 2015. Strains were identified at the species and biovar levels by classic and molecular techniques according to the World Organisation for Animal Health Manual. In total, 5,784 strains were typed: 3,089 Brucella abortus (53.4%), 2,497 B. melitensis (43.2%), 10 B. ovis (0.2%), 181 B. suis (3.1%), and 7 B. ceti (0.1%). The 2,981 strains from cattle were typed as B. abortus biovars 1, 3, and 6 (90.1%) and B. melitensis biovar 3 (9.9%). The 318 strains from water buffalo were typed as B. abortus biovars 1, 3 (95.9%) and B. melitensis biovar 3 (4.1%). The 2,279 strains from sheep and goats were typed as B. abortus biovars 1 and 3 (4.3%); B. melitensis biovars 1, 3, (95.3%); and B. ovis (0.4%). The 173 strains from wild boar were typed as B. suis biovar 2 (98.3%) and B. melitensis biovar 3 (1.7%). The 11 strains from pigs were typed as B. suis biovar 2. The 13 strains from humans were typed as B. melitensis biovar 3. The two strains from horses were typed as B. abortus biovar 1, while the seven strains from dolphins were typed as B. ceti. This additional knowledge on the epidemiology of brucellosis in Italy may be useful to formulate policies and strategies for the control and eradication of the disease in animal populations. The animal species affected, biovars typed, geographical origins, and spatial distributions of isolates are herein analyzed and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2924981678,"Selenium nanoparticle modified surfaces attract increasing attention in the field of tissue engineering. Selenium exhibits strong anticancer, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties and it maintains relatively low off-target cytotoxicity. In our paper, we present the fabrication, characterization and cytocompatibility of titanium oxide (TiO2) nanotube surface decorated with various surface densities of chemically synthesized selenium nanoparticles. To evaluate antibacterial and anti-cancer properties of such nanostructured surface, gram negative bacteria E. coli, cancerous osteoblast like MG-63 cells and non-cancerous fibroblast NIH/3T3 were cultured on designed surfaces. Our results suggested that selenium nanoparticles improved antibacterial properties of titanium dioxide nanotubes and confirmed the anticancer activity towards MG-63 cells, with increasing surface density of nanoparticles. Further, the selenium decorated TiO2 nanotubes suggested deteriorating effect on the cell adhesion and viability of non-cancerous NIH/3T3 cells. Thus, we demonstrated that selenium nanoparticles decorated TiO2 nanotubes synthesized using sodium selenite and glutathione can be used to control bacterial infections and prevent the growth of cancerous cells. However, the higher surface density of nanoparticles adsorbed on the surface was found to be cytotoxic for non-cancerous NIH/3T3 cells and thus it might complicate the integration of biomaterial into the host tissue. Therefore, an optimal surface density of selenium nanoparticles must be found to effectively kill bacteria and cancer cells, while remaining favorable for normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2944640149,"Probiotic products are becoming more prevalent as awareness of the role of beneficial microbes in health increases. Ingredient labels of these products often omit identifications at the strain level, making it difficult to track down applicable published research. In this study, we investigated whether products labeled with the same species name contained different strains of those species. From 21 commercially available probiotic supplements and beverages, we cultured five main species: Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. To confirm the identity of each bacterial isolate, we applied standard molecular approaches: 16S rRNA gene sequencing and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Phenotypic profiling and identification were performed with the Biolog Microbial Identification system. All of the bacterial isolates were correctly identified by at least one approach. Sequencing the 16S rRNA gene led to 82% of species identifications matching the product label, with 71% of isolates identified by MALDI-TOF MS and 60% identified correctly with the Biolog system. Analysis of the Biolog phenotypic profiles revealed different patterns of carbon source usage by each species, with sugars preferentially utilized by all except B. subtilis. To assess the strain-level differences, we compared strains of the same species and found variability in carbohydrate utilization and tolerance to environmental stressors (salt, acidity, antibiotics). By demonstrating that products listing the same species often contain strains with different 16S sequences and phenotypes, this study highlights that current labels of probiotic supplements do not sufficiently convey the strain diversity in these products."
https://openalex.org/W2925152248,"Swarming in parallel toward sociality The evolution of social behavior, and specifically of multicellularity, is poorly understood. An experimental model for multicellularity is the myxobacteria, which swarm and cooperate to form fruiting bodies in soil. Wielgoss et al. studied lineages of wild-caught myxobacteria. They found diversity, but also surprising genetic similarity, within fruiting bodies that was unlikely to be based on shared ancestry between them. Instead, reoccurrence of the same mutations seems to have occurred independently. These mutations have then been selected to confer similar phenotypes that converge on social behavior.

https://openalex.org/W2942325737,"During the past few decades, there has been a nationwide push to improve performance and persistence outcomes for STEM undergraduates. As part of this effort, recent research has emphasized the need for focus on not only improving the delivery of course content, but also addressing the social-psychological needs of students. One promising intervention type that has been proposed as a multifaceted way to address both cognitive and social-psychological aspects of the learning process is the learning community. Learning communities provide students with opportunities to build a strong support system in college and are generally associated with increased student engagement and integration with campus systems and cultures. In this study, we examine the impact of a learning community intervention for first-year biological sciences majors, the Enhanced Academic Success Experience (EASE) program. Incoming freshmen are assigned to EASE based on their SAT (or ACT equivalent) Math score, a metric demonstrated to be a key predictor of student success in the program. We find that enrollment in EASE is correlated with higher STEM course grades; an increase of 0.25 (on a 0-4 point scale) in cumulative first-year GPA; and gains in non-academic outcomes, such as measures of sense of belonging and academic integration. Further, these outcomes are more pronounced for particular subgroup populations. For example, whereas surveyed male students seemed to benefit academically from participating in a learning community, female students reported a greater sense of belonging in regard to the biological sciences major and reported higher values for behavioral indicators of academic integration. Lastly, we find that the EASE program is positively correlated with students' intention to stay in the biological sciences major. And, among the three race-oriented groups, this impact is most pronounced for under-represented students. In light of these findings, we discuss the potential of discipline-specific learning community programs to improve academic outcomes for students most at risk of leaving STEM majors, such as students underprepared for college level coursework."
https://openalex.org/W2961290387,"This paper develops the ability of the normal inverse Gaussian distribution (NIG) to fit the returns of bitcoin (BTC). As the first cryptocurrency created, the behavior of this new asset is characterized by great volatility. The lack of a proper definition or classification under existing theory exacerbates this property in such a way that explosive periods followed by a rapid decline have been observed along the series, meaning bubble episodes. By detecting the periods in which a bubble rises and collapses, it is possible to study the statistical properties of such segments. In particular, adjusting a theoretical distribution may help to determine better strategies to hedge against these episodes. The NIG is an appropriate candidate not only because of its heavy-tailed property but also because it has been proven to be closed under convolution, a characteristic that can be implemented to measure multivariate value at risk. Using data on the price of BTC with respect to seven of the main global currencies, the NIG was able to fit every time segment despite the bubble behavior. In the out-of-sample tests, the NIG was proven to have an adjustment similar to that of a generalized hyperbolic (GH) distribution. This result could serve as a starting point for future studies regarding the statistical properties of cryptocurrencies as well as their multivariate distributions."
https://openalex.org/W2991321296,"Tracking of clonal immunoglobulin V(D)J rearrangement sequences by next generation sequencing is highly sensitive for minimal residual disease in multiple myeloma. However, previous studies have found variable rates of V(D)J sequence identification at baseline, which could limit tracking. Here, we aimed to define the factors influencing the identification of clonal V(D)J sequences. Bone marrow mononuclear cells from 177 myeloma patients underwent V(D)J sequencing by the LymphoTrack assays (Invivoscribe). As a molecular control for tumor cell content, we sequenced the samples using our in-house myeloma panel myTYPE. V(D)J sequence clonality was identified in 81% of samples overall, as compared with 95% in samples where tumor-derived DNA was detectable by myTYPE. Clonality was detected more frequently in patients with lambda-restricted disease, mainly because of increased detection of kappa gene rearrangements. Finally, we describe how the tumor cell content of bone marrow aspirates decrease gradually in sequential pulls because of hemodilution: From the initial pull used for aspirate smear, to the final pull that is commonly used for research. In conclusion, baseline clonality detection rates of 95% or higher are feasible in multiple myeloma. Optimal performance depends on the use of good quality aspirates and/or subsequent tumor cell enrichment."
https://openalex.org/W2924475544,"The development of 'molecular-omic' tools and computing analysis platforms have greatly enhanced our ability to assess the impacts of agricultural practices and crop management protocols on soil microbial diversity. However, biotic factors are rarely factored into agricultural management models. Today it is possible to identify specific microbiomes and define biotic components that contribute to soil quality. We assessed the bacterial diversity of soils in 51 potato production plots. We describe a strategy for identifying a potato-crop-productivity bacterial species balance index based on amplicon sequence variants. We observed a significant impact of soil texture balances on potato yields; however, the Shannon and Chao1 richness indices and Pielou's evenness index poorly correlated with these yields. Nonetheless, we were able to estimate the portion of the total bacterial microbiome related to potato yield using an integrated species balances index derived from the elements of the bacterial microbiome that positively or negatively correlate with residual potato yields. This innovative strategy based on a microbiome selection procedure greatly enhances our ability to interpret the impact of agricultural practices and cropping system management choices on microbial diversity and potato yield. This strategy provides an additional tool that will aid growers and the broader agricultural sector in their decision-making processes concerning the soil quality and crop productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2943780118,"Sharks constitute a vital sector of marine and estuarine nekton and are of great commercial importance all over the world. International concern over the fate of shark fisheries has grown recently. However, information concerning the species diversity, geographic distribution and life histories of sharks in the Indo-Pacific region is highly limited. Comprehensive research on the species composition, distribution and seasonal occurrence of sharks in the southern South China Sea (SSCS) was conducted for four years. A total of 4742 sharks belonging to 10 families and 28 species were recorded from 6 fishing ports in SSCS. The families recorded included Squalidae, Heterodontidae, Orectolobidae, Hemiscylliidae, Alopiidae, Scyliorhinidae, Triakidae, Hemigaleidae, Carcharhinidae and Sphyrnidae. Seventeen of 28 shark species were landed at various developmental stages from in the ranges of or even less than the length at birth and from newborn juveniles to fully-mature. The results suggest that these sharks were born just before fishing and landing, and reproductive-stage sharks were also fished and landed. In total, 15 species, four species and one species in 28 shark species were categorized as Near Threatened, Vulnerable and Endangered species, respectively, on the IUCN Red List. Sharks are not targeted by fisheries practices in the SSCS, but are caught as bycatch throughout the year in various developmental stages. Thus, current fisheries practices in the SSCS area might lead to further decline to critical levels and lead to extinction of some of species in the future. These results suggest that the need for gear selectivity of the commercial fishing gears in order to reduce mortality and to conserve shark stocks."
https://openalex.org/W2944819019,"Introduction The triggering of severe dengue has been associated with an exacerbated inflammatory process characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β/IL-18, which are the product of inflammasome activation. Furthermore, alteration in the levels of high-density (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) has been observed; and HDL are known to have immunomodulatory properties, including the regulation of inflammasomes. While HDL would be expected to counteract hyperactivation of the inflammasome, the relationship between HDL and dengue severity, has not previously been explored. Methodology We conducted a cross-sectional study of 30 patients with dengue and 39 healthy controls matched by sex and age. Lipid profile and levels of C-reactive protein were quantified. Serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, and TNF-α, were assessed by ELISA. Expression of inflammasome-related genes in PBMC was quantified by qPCR. Results Dengue patients presented an alteration in the parameters of the lipid profile, with a significant decrease in HDL levels, which was more pronounced in dengue patients with warning signs. Moreover, a decrease in the expression of the inflammasome-related genes NLRP1, NLRC4, caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18 was observed, as well as an increase in serum levels of C-reactive protein and IL-10 in dengue patients versus healthy donors. Significant positive correlations between LDL levels and the relative expression of NLRP3, NLRC4, IL-1β and IL-18, were found. Conclusion The results suggest that there is a relationship between the alteration of LDL and HDL with the imbalance in the inflammatory response, which could be associated with the severity of dengue."
https://openalex.org/W2990710898,"In Kenya, access to early infant diagnosis and viral load monitoring services for HIV patients on ART is significantly hampered by sample transportation challenges and long turnaround times. Near patient care testing technologies have the potential to obviate such constraints. The Cepheid GeneXpert was launched in 2010 as a TB assay and in 2014 as a potential point of care HIV viral load assay. Whereas it is widely is used for TB in Kenya, its utility for HIV testing has not been evaluated.To investigate the performance and usability characteristics of the GeneXpert HIV-1 qualitative and quantitative assay.This was a cross sectional study among 911 HIV Exposed infants and 310 HIV positive adults. Existing machines used for routine TB diagnosis were used in this study. The diagnostic accuracy of the qualitative assay was assessed using Roche CAP/CTM while the quantitative assay was assessed using with Abbott m2000 as the reference assays respectively. Statistical analysis was done using Stata/MP Version 14 for Mac. Concordance values and misclassification were calculated at the clinical cutoff of 1000 cp/ml.The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the GeneXpert HIV-1 qualitative assay were 99.23% (95% CI 97.24-99.90%), 98.91% (95% CI 97.76-99.55%) and 99.00% respectively. For the quantitative assay, they were 92.50% (95% CI 79.61-98.43%), 100.00% and 97.00% respectively. All 30 (100%) users reported that the GeneXpert machine was easy to use, workflow was simple and TB diagnosis was not negatively affected. In our hands, the median turn-around time for an individual qualitative and quantitative test was 90 minutes. A total of 58 (4.34%) errors and 28 (2.10%) invalid outcomes were experienced; 44 (3.29%) tests did not run to completion due to power outages.GeneXpert HIV-1 qualitative and quantitative assay is an accurate test for the diagnosis of HIV in infants and for viral load monitoring. At the point of care, the GeneXpert machine's simple work flow, ease of use and short test turnaround time present the potential to improve access to HIV testing and viral load monitoring. To integrate HIV diagnosis into the existing GeneXpert platforms for TB Diagnosis, there is need to scale up the infrastructure and to change the way work is done."
https://openalex.org/W2923386324,"Background Few studies, based on a limited number of patients using non-uniform therapeutic protocols, have analyzed Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) eradication. Methods In a randomized multicenter trial conducted on patients with new-onset MRSA infection we evaluated the efficacy of an early eradication treatment (arm A) compared with an observational group (B). Arm A received oral rifampicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (21 days). Patients’ microbiological status, FEV1, BMI, pulmonary exacerbations and use of antibiotics were assessed. Results Sixty-one patients were randomized. Twenty-nine (47.5%) patients were assigned to active arm A and 32 (52.5%) patients to observational arm B. Twenty-nine (47.5%) patients, 10 patients in arm A and 19 in arm B, dropped out of the study. At 6 months MRSA was eradicated in 12 (63.2%) out of 19 patients in arm A while spontaneous clearance was observed in 5 (38.5%) out of 13 patients in arm B. A per-protocol analysis showed a 24.7% difference in the proportion of MRSA clearance between the two groups (z = 1.37, P(Z>z) = 0.08). Twenty-seven patients, 15 (78.9%) out of 19 in arm A and 12 (92.3%) out of 13 in arm B, were able to perform spirometry. The mean (±SD) FEV1 change from baseline was 7.13% (±14.92) in arm A and -1.16% (±5.25) in arm B (p = 0.08). In the same period the BMI change (mean ±SD) from baseline was 0.54 (±1.33) kg/m2 in arm A and -0.38 (±1.56) kg/m2 in arm B (p = 0.08). At 6 months no statistically significant differences regarding the number of pulmonary exacerbations, days spent in hospital and use of antibiotics were observed between the two arms. Conclusions Although the statistical power of the study is limited, we found a 24.7% higher clearance of MRSA in the active arm than in the observational arm at 6 months. Patients in the active arm A also had favorable FEV1 and BMI tendencies."

This study was performed on a stratified convenience sample of 350 nurses from 6 hospitals. Modified versions of burnout inventory, self-evaluation scale, and professional status scale were developed, validated and used in this study. Burnout, self-evaluation, and professional status are all found to be at moderate levels. Furthermore, self-evaluation and professional status are found to be important predictors of burnout. On the other hand, although type of hospital and educational level are found to be associated with the level of burnout, overall none of the studied demographic factors was found to be a significant predictor of burnout among nurses in Jordan."
https://openalex.org/W2951478585,"Cells on the surface of the mesonephros give rise to replicating Gonadal Ridge Epithelial-Like (GREL) cells, the first somatic cells of the gonadal ridge. Later germ cells associate with the GREL cells in the ovigerous cords, and the GREL cells subsequently give rise to the granulosa cells in follicles. To examine these events further, 27 bovine fetal ovaries of different gestational ages were collected and prepared for immunohistochemical localisation of collagen type I and Ki67 to identify regions of the ovary and cell proliferation, respectively. The non-stromal cortical areas (collagen-negative) containing GREL cells and germ cells and later in development, the follicles with oocytes and granulosa cells, were analysed morphometrically. Another set of ovaries (n = 17) were collected and the expression of genes associated with germ cell lineages and GREL/granulosa cells were quantitated by RT-PCR. The total volume of non-stromal areas in the cortex increased significantly and progressively with ovarian development, plateauing at the time the surface epithelium developed. However, the proportion of non-stromal areas in the cortex declined significantly and progressively throughout gestation, largely due to a cessation in growth of the non-stroma cells and the continued growth of stroma. The proliferation index in the non-stromal area was very high initially and then declined substantially at the time follicles formed. Thereafter, it remained low. The numerical density of the non-stromal cells was relatively constant throughout ovarian development. The expression levels of a number of genes across gestation either increased (AMH, FSHR, ESR1, INHBA), declined (CYP19A1, ESR2, ALDH1A1, DSG2, OCT4, LGR5) or showed no particular pattern (CCND2, CTNNB1, DAZL, FOXL2, GATA4, IGFBP3, KRT19, NR5A1, RARRES1, VASA, WNT2B). Many of the genes whose expression changed across gestation, were positively or negatively correlated with each other. The relationships between these genes may reflect their roles in the important events such as the transition of ovigerous cords to follicles, oogonia to oocytes or GREL cells to granulosa cells."
https://openalex.org/W2575533598,"Multidisciplinary rehabilitation has been recommended for multi-trauma patients, but there is only low-quality evidence to support its use with these patients. This study examined whether a Supported Fast track multi-Trauma Rehabilitation Service (Fast Track) was cost-effective compared to conventional trauma rehabilitation service (Care As Usual) in patients with multi-trauma from a societal perspective with a one-year follow-up.An economic evaluation alongside a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, controlled clinical study, was conducted in the Netherlands. The primary outcome measure was the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Generic Quality of Life and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) of the patients were derived using the Short-form 36 Health Status Questionnaire. Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) were stated in terms of costs per unit of FIM improvement and costs per QALY. To investigate the uncertainty around the ICERs, non-parametric bootstrapping was used.In total, 132 patients participated, 65 Fast Track patients and 67 Care As Usual patients. Mean total costs per person were €18,918 higher in the Fast Track group than in the Care As Usual group. Average incremental effects on the FIM were 3.7 points (in favor of the Fast Track group) and the incremental (extra) bootstrapped costs were €19,033, resulting in an ICER for cost per FIM improvement of €5,177. Care As Usual dominated Fast Track in cost per QALY as it gave both higher QALYs and lower costs. All sensitivity analyses attested to the robustness of our results.This study demonstrated that a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for multi-trauma patients according to the supported fast track principle is promising but cost-effectiveness evidence remains inconclusive. In terms of functional outcome, Fast Track was more expensive but yielded also more effects compared to the Care As Usual group. Looking at the costs per QALYs, unfavorable ICERs were found. Given the lack of a willingness-to-pay threshold for functional recovery and the relatively short time horizon, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the first.(Current Controlled Trials register: ISRCTN68246661)."

NLRs were obtained before commencement of CRT (pre-NLR) and between completion of CRT and surgery (post-NLR). Using Cox regression hazards models, the association of NLRs with survival after PSM was examined.A total of 131 patients were grouped as follows: group A, pre-NLR < 3 & post-NLR < 3 (n = 47); group B, pre-NLR < 3 & post-NLR ≥ 3 (n = 45); group C, pre-NLR ≥ 3 & post-NLR < 3 (n = 5); group D, pre-NLR ≥ 3 & post-NLR ≥ 3 (n = 34). There was no difference in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) rate according to group. When dichotomized into group A versus groups B-D, DFS was higher in group A (84.7%) than groups B-D (67.5%, p = 0.021). After PSM (n = 94), multivariable analysis identified persistent lower NLR as an independent favorable prognosticator of DFS (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.15-0.92, p = 0.033).Persistent non-inflammatory state measured by NLR may be an indicator of decreased risk of recurrence in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with preop-CRT."
https://openalex.org/W2924953673,"Reliable population estimates are fundamental to the conservation of endangered species. We evaluate here the use of photo-identification (photo-ID) and mark-recapture techniques for estimating the population size of the endangered Saimaa ringed seal (Phoca hispida saimensis). Photo-ID data based on the unique pelage patterns of individuals were collected by means of camera traps and boat-based surveys during the molting season in two of the species' main breeding areas, over a period of five years in the Pihlajavesi basin and eight years in the Haukivesi basin. An open model approach provided minimum population estimates for these two basins. The results indicated high survival rates and site fidelity among the adult seals. More accurate estimates can be obtained in the future by increasing the surveying effort both spatially and temporally. The method presented here proved effective for evaluating population size objectively, whereas the results of the current snow lair censuses are dependent on varying winter conditions, for instance. We therefore suggest that a photo-ID-based non-invasive mark-recapture method should be used for estimating Saimaa ringed seal abundances in order to ensure reliable, transparent population monitoring under changing climatic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2950122329,"Multiplexed bioassays, in which multiple analytes of interest are probed in parallel within a single small volume, have greatly accelerated the pace of biological discovery. Bead-based multiplexed bioassays have many technical advantages, including near solution-phase kinetics, small sample volume requirements, many within-assay replicates to reduce measurement error, and, for some bead materials, the ability to synthesize analytes directly on beads via solid-phase synthesis. To allow bead-based multiplexing, analytes can be synthesized on spectrally encoded beads with a 1:1 linkage between analyte identity and embedded codes. Bead-bound analyte libraries can then be pooled and incubated with a fluorescently-labeled macromolecule of interest, allowing downstream quantification of interactions between the macromolecule and all analytes simultaneously via imaging alone. Extracting quantitative binding data from these images poses several computational image processing challenges, requiring the ability to identify all beads in each image, quantify bound fluorescent material associated with each bead, and determine their embedded spectral code to reveal analyte identities. Here, we present a novel open-source Python software package (the mrbles analysis package) that provides the necessary tools to: (1) find encoded beads in a bright-field microscopy image; (2) quantify bound fluorescent material associated with bead perimeters; (3) identify embedded ratiometric spectral codes within beads; and (4) return data aggregated by embedded code and for each individual bead. We demonstrate the utility of this package by applying it towards analyzing data generated via multiplexed measurement of calcineurin protein binding to MRBLEs (Microspheres with Ratiometric Barcode Lanthanide Encoding) containing known and mutant binding peptide motifs. We anticipate that this flexible package should be applicable to a wide variety of assays, including simple bead or droplet finding analysis, quantification of binding to non-encoded beads, and analysis of multiplexed assays that use ratiometric, spectrally encoded beads."
https://openalex.org/W2965835949,"The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and the yeast Candida albicans (CA) are pathogens that cohabit the mucosa of the respiratory tracts of animals and humans. Their virulence is largely determined by chemical communication driven by quorum sensing systems (QS), and the cross perception of their quorum sensing molecules (QSM) can modulate the prevalence of one microorganism over the other. Aiming to investigate whether some of the protein components dissolved in the mucus layering the respiratory mucosa might interfere with virulence and cross-communication of these, and eventually other microorganisms, ligand binding assays were carried out to test the scavenging potential of the bovine and porcine forms of the Lipocalin odorant binding protein (OBP) for several QSMs (farnesol, and acylhomoserine lactones), and for pyocyanin, a toxin produced by PA. In addition, the direct antimicrobial activity of the OBPs was tested by time kill assay (TKA) against CA, PA and other bacteria and yeasts. The positivity of all the ligand binding assays and the antimicrobial activity determined for CA, and for some of the other microorganisms tested, let hypothesize that vertebrate OBPs might behave as humoral components of innate immunity, active against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. In addition, TKAs with mutants of bovine OBP with structural properties different from those of the native form, and with OBP forms tagged with histidines at the amino terminal, provided information about the mechanisms responsible of their antimicrobial activity and suggested possible applications of the OBPs as alternative or co-adjuvants to antibiotic therapeutic treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2922657752,"Filter feeding zooplankton are a crucial component of limnic food webs. Copepods and cladocerans are important prey organisms for first-level predators like the common and abundant larvae of phantom midges (Chaoborus sp.). The latter possess a complex catching basket built of head appendages specialized to capture small crustaceans. The predator-prey-relationship of Chaoborus (Diptera, Nematocera) and Daphnia (Crustacea, Cladocera) has been studied in particular detail owing to the daphniids' ability to react upon the threat of predation with inducible defenses. Daphnia pulex expresses so-called 'neckteeth' in the presence of Chaoborus larvae that are discussed as a defensive trait that interferes with the larval head appendages and their effectiveness has been shown in several studies. Nonetheless, mode of function of these neckteeth is not understood and the hypothesis that they interfere with the predator's head appendages still has to be confirmed. To clarify the role of neckteeth in Daphnia, an understanding of the Chaoborus capture apparatus is essential. Here, we present a detailed three-dimensional analysis of Chaoborus obscuripes' larval head morphology as well as a kinematic analysis of the attack motion, which revealed an impressive strike velocity (14 ms to prey contact). The movement of the larvae's head appendages is reconstructed in the three-dimensional space using a combination of high-speed videography, micro-computed tomography and computer animation. Furthermore, we provide predation trial data to distinguish between pre- and post-attack defensive effects in D. pulex. Our findings suggest a combination of pre- and post-attack defenses with an average effectiveness of 50% each. With this study, we quantitatively describe prey capture kinematics of C. obscuripes and take a further step to reveal the neckteeth' mode of function in D. pulex."
https://openalex.org/W2938525270,"Coral recruitment refers to the processes allowing maintenance and renewal of coral communities. Recruitment success is therefore indispensable for coral reef recovery after disturbances. Recruitment processes are governed by a variety of factors occurring at all spatial and temporal scales, from centimetres to hundreds of kilometres. In the present context of rising disturbances, it is thus of major importance to better understand the relative importance of different scales in this variation, and when possible, the factors associated with these scales. Multiscale spatio-temporal variability of scleractinian coral recruitment was investigated at two of the Mascarene Islands: Reunion and Rodrigues. Recruitment rates and taxonomic composition were examined during three consecutive six-month periods from regional to micro-local scales (i.e. from hundreds of kilometres to few centimetres) and between two protection levels (no-take zones and general protection zones). Very low recruitment rates were observed. Rodrigues displayed lower recruitment rates than Reunion. Recruit assemblage was dominated by Pocilloporidae (77.9%), followed by Acroporidae (9.9%) and Poritidae (5.2%). No protection effect was identified on coral recruitment, despite differences in recruitment rates among sites within islands. Recruits were patchily distributed within sites but no aggregative effect was detected, i.e. the preferentially colonised tiles were not spatially grouped. Recruits settled mainly on the sides of the tiles, especially at Rodrigues, which could be attributed to the high concentration of suspended matter. The variability of recruitment patterns at various spatial scales emphasises the importance of micro- to macro-local variations of the environment in the dynamics and maintenance of coral populations. High temporal variability was also detected, between seasons and years, which may be related to the early 2016 bleaching event at Rodrigues. The low recruitment rates and the absence of protection effect raise questions about the potential for recovery from disturbances of coral reefs in the Mascarene Islands."
https://openalex.org/W2941463689,"Crop damage by forest elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis) and the resulting human-elephant conflict are issues of great concern for both the conservation of the species and the protection of rural livelihoods in Central Africa. Addressing these problems requires identifying the factors that facilitate or impede crop-raiding by forest elephants. Yet to date, the environmental or anthropogenic factors that influence the occurrence and intensity of crop-raiding by forest elephants are largely unknown. We used a multivariate approach to investigate conditions under which forest elephants raid some fields and not others in the buffer zone of Monts de Cristal National Park (MCNP), Gabon. We first interviewed 121 farmers from 11 villages situated within 10 km of MCNP regarding the occurrence of elephant crop-raiding of their fields. We then collected data on 39 explanatory variables to characterize the agricultural fields. Of these, the most important predictors of elephant raid occurrence of crop damage were presence of fruit trees, elephant deterrents (scarecrows, fire, wire string fences and empty barrels), and field topography. We secondly assessed the effect of stage of crop growth, presence of fruit trees, field topography and presence of elephant deterrents on crop-raiding occurrence and intensity by counting raids and measuring areas of crop damage every week in 17 plantations over 19 weeks in the most elephant-impacted zone of the study area. We found that fruit presence and stage of crop growth led to more intense damage to crops, whereas local deterrents did not inhibit raiding events and crop damage by elephants. We report a tradeoff between non-timber forest products (NTFP) services and crop-raiding by elephants. We show for the first time that steep topography impedes elephant damage to crops with no raids recorded in fields with surrounding slopes greater than 25%. We discuss whether farming on steep fields could be used as a strategy for mitigating crop-raiding to favor human-elephant coexistence and enhance elephant conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2980651787,"Understanding the mechanisms of kidney stone formation, development patterns and associated pathological features are gaining importance due to an increase in the prevalence of the disease and diversity in the presentation of the stone composition. Based on the microstructural characteristics of kidney stones, it may be possible to explain the differences in the pathogenesis of pure and mixed types of stones. In this study, the microstructure and distribution of mineral components of kidney stones of different mineralogy (pure and mixed types) were analyzed. The intact stones removed from patients were investigated using synchrotron radiation X-ray computed microtomography (SR-μCT) and the tomography slice images were reconstructed representing the density and structure distribution at various elevation planes. Infrared (IR) spectroscopes, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to confirm the bulk mineral composition in the thin section stones. Observations revealed differences in the micro-morphology of the kidney stones with similar composition in the internal 3-D structure. Calcium oxalate monohydrate stones showed well-organised layering patterns, while uric acid stones showed lower absorption signals with homogenous inner structure. Distinct mineral phases in the mixed types were identified based on the differential absorption rates. The 3-D quantitative analysis of internal porosity and spatial variation between nine different types of stones were compared. The diversity among the microstructure of similar and different types of stones shows that the stone formation is complex and may be governed by both physiological and micro-environmental factors. These factors may predispose a few towards crystal aggregation and stone growth, while, in others the crystals may not establish stable attachment and/or growth."
https://openalex.org/W2944473368,"The Aerobic Scope (AS), which reflects the functional capacity for biological fitness, is a highly relevant proxy to determine thermal tolerance in various taxa. Despite the importance of this method, its implementation is often hindered, due to lacking techniques to accurately measure standard- (SMR) and maximal- (MMR) metabolic rates, especially in sluggish marine invertebrates with low oxygen consumption rates, such as sea cucumbers. In this study the AS concept was modified to define a Temperature-induced Aerobic Scope (TAS), based on metabolic rate changes due to temperature adjustments rather than traditionally used physical activity patterns. Consequentially, temperature dependent peak and bottom O2 consumption rates, defined as Temperature-induced Maximal- (TMMR) and Standard Metabolic Rates (TSMR), respectively, served as MMR and SMR alternatives for the sea cucumber Holothuria scabra. TMMR and TSMR were induced through acute temperature change (2°C per hour; 17-41°C) until critical warm (WTcrit) and cold (CTcrit) temperatures were reached, respectively. In addition, Hsp70 gene expression linked to respiration rates served as synergistic markers to confirm critical threshold temperatures. O2 consumption of H. scabra peaked distinctly at WTcrit of 38°C (TMMR = 33.2 ± 4.7 μgO2 g-1 h-1). A clear metabolic bottom line was reached at CTcrit of 22°C (TSMR = 2.2 ± 1.4 μgO2 g-1 h-1). Within the thermal window of 22-38°C H. scabra sustained positive aerobic capacity, with assumed optimal performance range between 29-31.5°C (13.85-18.7 μgO2 g-1 h-1). Between 39-41°C H. scabra decreased respiration progressively, while gene expression levels of Hsp70 increased significantly at 41°C, indicating prioritization of heat shock response (HSR) and homeostatic disruption. At the cold end (17-22°C) homeostatic disruption was visible through incrementally increasing energetic expenses to fuel basal maintenance costs, but no Hsp70 overexpression occurred. TMMR, TSMR and TAS proved to be reliable metrics, similar to the traditional energetic key parameters MMR, SMR and AS, to determine a specific aerobic performance window for the sluggish bottom dwelling species H. scabra. In addition, the linkage between respiration physiology and molecular defense mechanisms showed valuable analytical synergies in terms of mechanistic prioritization as response to thermal stress. Overall, this study will help to define lethal temperatures for aquaculture and to predict the effects of environmental stress, such as ocean warming, in H. scabra."

Energy drink consumption is partly associated with energy drink perception, but little is known about this in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify the relationships between energy drink consumption, energy drink perception, weight status and sociodemographic characteristics in a school-going sample of Pacific adolescents.A cross-sectional study carried out in the schools during school hours between July 2015 and April 2016.Sociodemographic characteristics, weight status, energy drink perception, and quantity of energy drinks consumed were obtained. Chi-square tests of independence, independent t tests, multivariate logistic regressions and multiple linear regressions were used.A representative sample of 678 New Caledonian adolescents (11-16 years).We found that one third of New Caledonian adolescents consume energy drinks. Boys are more likely to drink them than girls and Polynesians drink significantly more than European and Melanesian adolescents. Higher energy drink consumption in the New Caledonian adolescents is associated with good or neutral perceptions of the energy drink impact on health. Moreover, sex (being male) significantly influences the total energy drink consumption per week. Energy drink consumers have a tendency toward better perceptions of energy drinks than non-consumers.Nutritional education targeting energy drink consumers should take these results into account by providing (community-based) educational programs, especially for adolescents from low socioeconomic backgrounds, boys, or those living in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2937432577,"In the western United States, the long-term recovery of many Pacific salmon populations is inextricably linked to freshwater habitat quality. Industrial activities from the past century have left a legacy of pollutants that persist, particularly near working waterfronts. The adverse impacts of these contaminants on salmon health have been studied for decades, but the population-scale consequences of chemical exposure for salmonids are still poorly understood. We estimated acute and delayed mortality rates for seaward migrating juvenile Chinook salmon that feed and grow in a Superfund-designated area in the Lower Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. We combined previous, field-collected exposure data for juvenile Chinook salmon together with reduced growth and disease resistance data from earlier field and laboratory studies. Estimates of mortality were then incorporated into a life cycle model to explore chemical habitat-related fish loss. We found that 54% improved juvenile survival—potentially as a result of future remediation activities—could increase adult Chinook salmon population abundance by more than 20%. This study provides a framework for evaluating pollution remediation as a positive driver for species recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2997993279,"The reasonable delay time of millisecond-delay blasting using digital electronic detonators can significantly reduce the vibration effects induced by tunnel blasting. This study proposes a method for calculating the delay time for cut holes, easer holes and periphery holes, considering the rocks breaking effect as well as wave superposition theory. And then according to the actual layout diagram of the tunnel holes, the delay time calculation formulas of different holes are put forward. Then the delay times were calculated according to the formulas and applied in the field tests. The velocities, rocks breaking and wave superposition cancellation of the vibration using different delay times are analyzed with digital electronic detonators. Then the optimum delay times of different holes were obtained and applied to New Hongyan tunnel project. The velocity and frequency of the vibration with digital electronic detonators are analyzed, compared with non-electronic detonators. The effects of charge and delay time on the velocity and principal frequency of a blasting seismic wave are discussed. The results indicate that the delay time for the holes must be prioritized to achieve breaking effects in the rock with the simultaneous formation of a new free surface, next considering the wave superposition cancellation. When the delay time of cut holes was 5 ms, the rocks breaking effect and wave superposition cancellation effect both worked well. The velocity of the vibration induced by the cut holes blasting was about only 0.46–0.51 cm/s. When the delay time was 6 ms or much longer, the rocks breaking effect would fail. With regard to the easer holes and periphery holes, the optimum delay time of them were all 5ms. The vertical peak particle velocity was reduced from 2.974 cm/s to 0.901 cm/s with digital electronic detonators. Therefore, the velocity had decreased by 69.70% than non-electronic detonators, which was caused by reducing the single simultaneous explosive charge and setting optimum delay time. The proposed delay time calculation method is demonstrated to be sufficiently accurate and can thus be used as a guideline to reduce tunnel blasting vibrations."

Patients were evaluated radiographically and clinically. The questionnaires of the American Knee Society Score (KSS), the Ankle-Hindfoot Scale of the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS), Visual Analogue Scale/Score (VAS) were used to assess the patients clinically. Radiographic evaluations were measured by the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), the femoro-tibial angle (FTA), tibial inclination (TI), distal tibial articural surface (TAS), talar tilt (TT), length of fibular (FL), and hind foot alignment such as hindfoot alignment view angle (HAVA), hindfoot alignment ratio (HAR), and hindfoot moment arm (HMA). Of the 53 subjects, no significant differences were exhibited in AOFAS, VAS scores and FL in ankle joint, but a significant differences were demonstrated in KSS score, HKA, FTA, TI, TT, HAVA, HAR and HMA after PFO. Due to the structural improvements of ankle joint, PFO not only improves joint function but also the alignment of ankle joint radiographically, and is still recommended as a safe surgery in treating medial compartment osteoarthritis of knee."

The aim of this study was to document responses to noticing the changes preceding a diagnosis of brain cancer and living with them, focusing on appraisal of changes and the decision to seek (and re-seek) help, with attention to the psychological processes underpinning the appraisal and help-seeking intervals.In this qualitative study set in Eastern and NW England, in-depth interviews with adult patients recently diagnosed with primary brain cancer and their family members were analysed thematically, using the Model of Pathways to Treatment as a conceptual framework.39 adult patients were interviewed. Regarding the appraisal interval, cognitive heuristics were found to underpin explanations of changes/symptoms. The subtlety and normality of changes often suggested nothing serious was wrong. Common explanations included stress or being busy at work, or age and these did not seem to warrant a visit to a doctor. Explanations and the decision to seek help were made within the social context, with friends, family and work colleagues contributing to appraisal and help-seeking decisions. Regarding the help-seeking interval, barriers to seeking help reflected components of Social Cognitive Theory, and included having other priorities, outcome expectations (e.g. 'feeling silly', not sure much can be done about it, not wanting to waste doctors' time) and accessibility of a preferred healthcare professional.Application of psychological theory facilitated understanding of the influences on cognition and behaviour. The study highlights implications for theory, awareness campaigns and potential opportunities promoting more timely help-seeking."
https://openalex.org/W2925427702,"Background Breast milk is important to infant health, yet shorter breastfeeding duration is reported for preterm infants. Both breast and bottle feeds are given in the neonatal unit, with full oral feeding often the last milestone to be achieved prior to discharge home. Unlike standard bottle teats, a vacuum release teat requires the application of negative intra-oral pressure to release milk, and so may facilitate breastfeeding in preterm infants. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of vacuum release teat use on timing of achievement of the first full oral feed and on first completion of 24 h full oral feeds. Feeding method at discharge home, 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks corrected gestational age were also examined. Methods A randomized controlled trial was completed with mothers of preterm infants born 24–33 weeks gestation in the neonatal unit of a tertiary women’s hospital. Infants were randomized to one of two parallel groups using a vacuum release teat or standard teat for oral feeds when the mother was not available to breastfeed. Test weights were completed for all oral feeds. It was not possible to blind participants, care givers and outcome assessors to group assignment due to the nature of the study. Results The groups did not differ with regard to timing of achievement of first full oral feed or 24 h of full oral feeds. Significantly more infants in the vacuum release teat group were exclusively fed breast milk at discharge from hospital and breastfed at 3 months corrected gestational age. Conclusions Use of a vacuum release teat when the mother is not available to breastfeed may promote preterm breastfeeding skills, resulting in higher rates of exclusivity and longer breastfeeding duration. Trial registration The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12615000245594."
https://openalex.org/W2939231406,"Given the uncertain population status of low-density, widely-occurring raptors, monitoring changes in abundance and distribution is critical to conserving populations. Nest-based monitoring is a common, useful approach, but the difficulty and expense of monitoring raptor nests and importance of reliable trend data to conservation requires that limited resources are allocated efficiently. Power analyses offer a helpful tool to ensure that monitoring programs have the ability to detect trends and to optimize financial resources devoted to monitoring. We evaluated alternative monitoring designs for raptors to identify appropriate survey effort to detect population trends. We used data collected from a territory-occupancy study of ferruginous hawks throughout Wyoming to guide simulations and evaluate the ability to detect trends in occupancy rates. Results suggest that greater gains in precision of trend estimation may be achieved through the addition of more sites and not more visits; statistical power was ≥80% when monitoring lasted 20 years and population declines were 20%; and probability of detection affected statistical power less than rates of population decline. Monitoring at least 150 sites for 20 years would provide reasonable estimates of trend in occupancy given certain rates of detection and occupancy, but only for population declines of 20%. Removal sampling did not result in substantial changes of any metrics used to evaluate simulations, providing little justification for employing the standard design if territory occupancy is the variable of interest. Initial rates of territory occupancy may be biased high, a problem inherent to many studies that monitor territory occupancy. We explored the effects of lower rates of initial occupancy on the ability to detect trends. Although we present data from a study of ferruginous hawks, our simulations can be applied to other raptor species with similar life history and population dynamics to provide guidance for future trend estimation of territory occupancy."

The results revealed that plums have a wide variation in composition and that variation among locations was greater than variation among cultivars. This was also the case for different years at one location. The results supported the supposition that the transgene and insertion event had no significant effect on the composition of ‘HoneySweet’ fruit even under virus pressure, and that it fell in the normal range of composition of commercially grown plums.

https://openalex.org/W3022844577,"Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of human RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is regulated during the transcription cycle by the combined action of specific kinases and phosphatases. Pol II enters into the preinitiation complex (PIC) unphosphorylated, but is quickly phosphorylated by Cdk7 during initiation. How phosphatases alter the pattern and extent of CTD phosphorylation at this early stage of transcription is not clear. We previously demonstrated the functional association of an early-acting, magnesium-independent phosphatase with early elongation complexes. Here we show that Ssu72 is responsible for that activity. We found that the phosphatase enters the transcription cycle during the formation of PICs and that Ssu72 is physically associated with very early elongation complexes. The association of Ssu72 with elongation complexes was stable to extensive washing with up to 200 mM KCl. Interestingly, Ssu72 ceased to function on complexes that contained RNA longer than 28 nt. However, when PICs were washed before initiation, the strict cutoff at 28 nt was lost. This suggests that factor(s) are important for the specific regulation of Ssu72 function during the transition between initiation and pausing. Overall, our results demonstrate when Ssu72 can act on early transcription complexes and suggest that Ssu72 may also function in the PIC prior to initiation."

This is likely because shooter proprioception can help determine shot outcome, even before their eyes confirm it. This phenomenon, however, has not been systematically explored for collegiate and recreational shooters. This study compared how well collegiate shooters and recreational shooters could predict outcomes of their own free throws without seeing the shot result. Forty collegiate and recreational shooters shot standard free throws while wearing liquid-crystal occlusion glasses that activated to occlude vision immediately following ball release during each shot. After each shot, shooters verbally predicted shot outcome as ""in"" or ""out"", and predicted results were compared with actual outcomes. As anticipated, for made shots, collegiate shooters more accurately predicted their own shots than recreational shooters. However, unexpectedly, for missed shots, collegiate shooters were worse than recreational shooters and were even significantly worse than chance. Further analysis found that collegiate shooters exhibited a significantly higher bias toward predicting their shots as ""in"". Understanding how shooters of different skill levels perceive their own shot could inform future training strategies for improving shooter accuracy."

The lissamphibian braincase has a highly derived morphology with several secondarily lost elements; however, these losses have never been incorporated into phylogenetic analyses and thus the timing and nature of these evolutionary events remain unknown. Hindering research into this problem has been the lack of phylogenetic analyses of Dissorophoidea that includes both taxonomically dense sampling and specific characters to document changes in the braincase in the lineage leading to Lissamphibia. Here we build on a recent, broadly sampled dissorophoid phylogenetic analysis to visualize key events in the evolution of the lissamphibian braincase. Our ancestral character state reconstructions show a clear, step-wise trend towards reduction of braincase ossification leading to lissamphibians, including reduction of the sphenethmoid, loss of the basioccipital at the Amphibamiformes node, and further loss of both the basisphenoid and the hypoglossal nerve foramina at the Lissamphibia node. Our analysis confirms that the highly derived condition of the lissamphibian braincase is characterized by overall simplification in terms of the number and extent of chondrocranial ossifications."

https://openalex.org/W2944641533,"Ocular toxoplasmosis (OT), mostly retinochorioditis, is a major feature of infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The pathophysiology of this infection is still largely elusive; especially mouse models are not yet well developed. In contrast, numerous in vitro studies showed the highly Toxoplasma strain dependent nature of the host-parasite interactions. Some distinct polymorphic virulence factors were characterized, notably the rhoptry protein ROP16. Here, we studied the strain-dependent pathophysiology in our OT mouse model. Besides of two wild type strains of the canonical I (RH, virulent) and II (PRU, avirulent) types, we used genetically engineered parasites, RHΔROP16 and PRU ROP16-I, expressing the type I allele of this virulence factor. We analyzed retinal integrity, parasite proliferation and retinal expression of cytokines. PRU parasites behaved much more virulently in the presence of a type I ROP16. In contrast, knockout of ROP16 in the RH strain led to a decrease of intraocular proliferation, but no difference in retinal pathology. Cytokine quantification in aqueous humor showed strong production of Th1 and inflammatory markers following infection with the two strains containing the ROP16-I allele. In strong contrast, immunofluorescence images showed that actual expression of most cytokines in retinal cells is rapidly suppressed by type I strain infection, with or without the involvement of its homologous ROP16 allele. This demonstrates the particular immune privileged situation of the retina, which is also revealed by the fact that parasite proliferation is nearly exclusively observed outside the retina. In summary, we further developed a promising OT mouse model and demonstrated the specific pathology in retinal tissues."

Running it was part of my job as a university program manager, working on a project to boost biotech collaborations between academia and industry. When I started in the role a few years earlier, I thought that maybe, after years of career exploration, I had finally found the right job for me. But at the conference, I found myself wondering whether that was really what I wanted from my career. I'm a scientist, not an event planner—but I had been too busy organizing the conference to appreciate the research being discussed. Was it time for yet another change?

> “I spent a few years in each role only to find that it wasn't quite the right fit.” 

I had always thought that you were supposed to find the ideal job, one that ticked all the boxes. So, after my Ph.D., that's what I went looking for.

I started off as a lab scientist. But after two postdoc positions, I discovered that the highly focused nature of lab work wasn't for me. My next job was at a pharmaceutical company—conducting literature searches, compiling newsletters, and gathering information about the company's competitors. I enjoyed the work, which allowed me to stay close to research and interact with a variety of people. But I was only offered a short-term contract, so after a year I had to move on. I then became a scientific journal editor. I loved the breadth of science that I was exposed to, but the job required a lengthy commute. So, I made another dramatic change and moved back to the ivory tower for my current job.

It had become a pattern: I spent a few years in each role only to find that it wasn't quite the right fit, then moved on to try something else. In this process I built up a lot of great experience and expertise in a variety of sectors, but I felt that I'd had a series of jobs rather than a career that was moving forward in the way I wanted. I also realized that maybe I was searching for something that didn't exist.

Organizing that conference was a turning point. Although I loved the buzz I got from running a successful event, I could not deny that parts of my work were unfulfilling. But instead of moving on again, I began to think about creative ways to add the scientific stimulation I sought to my work life. I needed a way to dip into different areas of research while keeping my “regular” job. With my knowledge of the pharmaceutical and biotech industries and my experience as an editor, I realized I had the skill set to do that through freelance science writing, such as news articles for journals and blogs and reports for industry.

I put out some feelers to former colleagues from my days as a journal editor and was encouraged by their positive responses. It seemed that this might actually work—if I could find the time to balance it with my staff job. I wanted to dedicate sufficient time to writing, and I felt I could do my university job on a less than full-time schedule.

I waited until the time felt right to broach the topic of reducing my work hours with my manager. The opportunity came when an informal conversation on the train turned to the next phase of the project I managed. I used this as a hook for describing how my job responsibilities could be managed in fewer hours—I proposed 80% time—and my vision for my future. He agreed before I even completed my prepared pitch, I think largely because he respected that I was taking the initiative to manage my own career. In a happy coincidence, my first freelance assignment landed in my inbox on my first day of reduced hours.

For the last year, I have been a university program manager-slash-freelance writer, and I've never been happier. Working out what kind of freelance work to take on—and just as important, turn down—so that I can weave the two roles together has been a bit tricky at times. I recently reduced my university hours to about half time to make it work. But I finally feel I have a career that is tailored to my needs. It took me a while to get here, but I've realized that a career doesn't need to be “off the shelf.” Jobs can be mixed and matched to get to one that fits.

https://openalex.org/W2942774686,"Although a 3-arm DOTA construct, which has three carboxylic acids, h has been applied for conjugation to many peptides, we investigated if a 4-arm DOTA construct conjugated to peptides improves chemical properties for melanoma imaging of the melanocortin 1 receptor compared to 3-arm DOTA-conjugated peptides.Specific activities, radiolabeling efficiencies, and partition coefficients were evaluated using 111In-labeled 3-arm and 4-arm DOTA-α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). For assessment of MC1-R affinity and accumulation in tumor cells in vitro, B16-F1 melanoma and/or 4T1 breast cancer cells were incubated with 111In-labeled 3-arm and 4-arm DOTA-α-MSH with and without α-MSH as a substrate. The stability was evaluated using mouse liver homogenates and plasma. Biological distribution and whole-body single photon emission computed tomography imaging of 111In-labeled 3-arm and 4-arm DOTA-α-MSH were obtained using B16-F1 melanoma-bearing mice.Specific activities and radiolabeling efficiencies of both radiotracers were about 1.2 MBq/nM and 90-95%, respectively. The partition coefficients were -0.28 ± 0.03 for 111In-labeled 3-arm DOTA-α-MSH and -0.13 ± 0.04 for 111In-labeled 4-arm DOTA-α-MSH. Although accumulation was significantly inhibited by α-MSH in B16-F1 cells, the inhibition rate of 111In-labeled 4-arm DOTA-α-MSH was lower than that of 111In-labeled 3-arm DOTA-α-MSH. 111In-labeled 4-arm DOTA-α-MSH was taken up early into B16-F1 cells and showed higher accumulation than 111In-labeled 3-arm DOTA-α-MSH after 10 min of incubation. Although these stabilities were relatively high, the stability of 111In-labeled 4-arm DOTA-α-MSH was higher than that of 111In-labeled 3-arm DOTA-α-MSH. Regarding biological distribution, 111In-labeled 4-arm DOTA-α-MSH showed significantly lower average renal accumulation (1.38-fold) and significantly higher average melanoma accumulation (1.32-fold) than 111In-labeled 3-arm DOTA-α-MSH at all acquisition times. 111In-labeled 4-arm DOTA-α-MSH showed significantly higher melanoma-to-kidney, melanoma-to-blood, and melanoma-to-muscle ratios than 111In-labeled 3-arm DOTA-α-MSH.The 4-arm DOTA construct has better chemical properties for peptide radiotracers than the 3-arm DOTA construct."
https://openalex.org/W2962131833,"Human-carnivore conflict can threaten human life and livelihoods, leading to retaliation that negatively affects carnivore conservation. The endangered African wild dog Lycaon pictus is prone to human-carnivore conflict. Therefore, it is imperative to understand which landscape features are associated with African wild dog occurrence since selection or avoidance of these features could predict the levels of conflict. We investigated resource selection in the African wild dog in relation to four anthropogenic landscape features (livestock density, agriculture, roads and human land use) within the landscape that may pose a mortality risk, as well as one natural feature (nature reserves). We compared spatio-temporal space use patterns of four African wild dog packs in north-eastern South Africa. Data were collected from one collared individual per pack. These packs constituted approximately 10% of the total remaining African wild dog population in South Africa. Two packs occurred outside of the Kruger National Park and had access to multiple areas with farmland and other anthropogenic features, whereas the remaining two packs mainly occurred within the boundaries of the Kruger National Park but made occasional forays outside of park boundaries. Utilising Resource Selection Functions and GIS analyses, we found that agricultural landscape features, roads and nature reserves were important predictors of African wild dog occurrence for all four packs. In addition to potential conflict with farmers, high odds of occurrence on roads with fast-moving traffic and road mortality was highlighted as a concern for three of the packs. While farms and areas that house livestock were readily available, pack presence occurred in areas with few farms and low livestock densities, pointing to avoidance of areas where human-carnivore conflict and resulting mortality could occur. Our study highlights potential threats to the persistence of the African wild dog, which can be used to inform future conservation efforts of the species."
