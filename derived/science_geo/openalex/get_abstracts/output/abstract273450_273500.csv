In recent years, investigators have begun to challenge many common assumptions about jury behavior. An important tool in this effort has been the mock jury experiment, in which research participants are randomly assigned to alternative trial conditions and asked to reach a verdict in a simulated case. Researchers have used mock jury experiments to test hypotheses about causal influences on jury behavior and to develop theoretical models of the jury deliberation process."

The mandible is incapable of any fore-aft movement, and feeding typically involves little or no intraoral processing. Complex, multi-cusped, mammal-like teeth differentiated along the tooth row have been found in a Cretaceous crocodylian from Malawi. The morphology of the teeth and mandible indicates that food items were processed by back-to-front (proal) movement of the mandible, unlike living crocodylians but as in some mammals and Sphenodon (the tuatara)."

The heliosphere is an ideal astrophysical laboratory, wherein one can observe in situ the elementary mechanisms involved in the particle acceleration processes. Two phenomena of special interest are stochastic acceleration in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence around comets and stochastic shock acceleration at interplanetary shock waves."

Her correct affiliation is the University of Southern Colorado."

Harris stated that, ""... the reduced contrast with decreasing (terminator distance) just balances the increase in visibility due to shadow length."" This is obviously erroneous. A more careful examination of the problem shows that for favorable values of the Aerocentric EarthSun Sun angle, visibility of relief increases toward the terminator, clouds not withstanding."
