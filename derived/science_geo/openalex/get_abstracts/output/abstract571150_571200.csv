Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we generated dynamic metabolome and proteome profiles of human primary naive T cells following activation. We discovered critical changes in the arginine metabolism that led to a drop in intracellular L-arginine concentration. Elevating L-arginine levels induced global metabolic changes including a shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in activated T cells and promoted the generation of central memory-like cells endowed with higher survival capacity and, in a mouse model, anti-tumor activity. Proteome-wide probing of structural alterations, validated by the analysis of knockout T cell clones, identified three transcriptional regulators (BAZ1B, PSIP1, and TSN) that sensed L-arginine levels and promoted T cell survival. Thus, intracellular L-arginine concentrations directly impact the metabolic fitness and survival capacity of T cells that are crucial for anti-tumor responses."
https://openalex.org/W2533236332,"Poor responses of liver metastases to the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab in patients with colorectal and breast cancer correlate with tumor co-option of pre-existing blood vessels, a mechanism of tumor resistance that might be targeted by the inhibition of cancer cell motility. The efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer is limited by resistance mechanisms that are poorly understood. Notably, instead of through the induction of angiogenesis, tumor vascularization can occur through the nonangiogenic mechanism of vessel co-option. Here we show that vessel co-option is associated with a poor response to the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Moreover, we find that vessel co-option is also prevalent in human breast cancer liver metastases, a setting in which results with anti-angiogenic therapy have been disappointing. In preclinical mechanistic studies, we found that cancer cell motility mediated by the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3) is required for vessel co-option in liver metastases in vivo and that, in this setting, combined inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co-option is more effective than the inhibition of angiogenesis alone. Vessel co-option is therefore a clinically relevant mechanism of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy and combined inhibition of angiogenesis and vessel co-option might be a warranted therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2530261838,"The argument that human society can decouple economic growth—defined as growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP)—from growth in environmental impacts is appealing. If such decoupling is possible, it means that GDP growth is a sustainable societal goal. Here we show that the decoupling concept can be interpreted using an easily understood model of economic growth and environmental impact. The simple model is compared to historical data and modelled projections to demonstrate that growth in GDP ultimately cannot be decoupled from growth in material and energy use. It is therefore misleading to develop growth-oriented policy around the expectation that decoupling is possible. We also note that GDP is increasingly seen as a poor proxy for societal wellbeing. GDP growth is therefore a questionable societal goal. Society can sustainably improve wellbeing, including the wellbeing of its natural assets, but only by discarding GDP growth as the goal in favor of more comprehensive measures of societal wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W2531301510,"Heritability and genome stability are shaped by meiotic recombination, which is initiated via hundreds of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The distribution of DSBs throughout the genome is not random, but mechanisms molding this landscape remain poorly understood. Here, we exploit genome-wide maps of mouse DSBs at unprecedented nucleotide resolution to uncover previously invisible spatial features of recombination. At fine scale, we reveal a stereotyped hotspot structure-DSBs occur within narrow zones between methylated nucleosomes-and identify relationships between SPO11, chromatin, and the histone methyltransferase PRDM9. At large scale, DSB formation is suppressed on non-homologous portions of the sex chromosomes via the DSB-responsive kinase ATM, which also shapes the autosomal DSB landscape at multiple size scales. We also provide a genome-wide analysis of exonucleolytic DSB resection lengths and elucidate spatial relationships between DSBs and recombination products. Our results paint a comprehensive picture of features governing successive steps in mammalian meiotic recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2531096663,"Inhibitory interneurons are thought to play crucial roles in diverse brain functions. However, roles of different inhibitory interneuron subtypes in working memory remain unclear. We found distinct activity patterns and stimulation effects of two major interneuron subtypes, parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SOM)-expressing interneurons, in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice performing a spatial working memory task. PV interneurons showed weak target-dependent delay-period activity and were strongly inhibited by reward. By contrast, SOM interneurons showed strong target-dependent delay-period activity, and only a subtype of them was inhibited by reward. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of PV and SOM interneurons preferentially suppressed discharges of putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively. These results indicate different contributions of PV and SOM interneurons to prefrontal cortical circuit dynamics underlying working memory."

Two readers independently segmented the whole tumor volume. Fifteen radiomic features were extracted and compared among reconstruction algorithms. Intra- and inter-reader variability and inter-reconstruction algorithm variability were calculated using coefficients of variation (CVs) and then compared.Among the 15 features, 5 first-order tumor intensity features and 4 gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based features showed significant differences (p<0.05) among reconstruction algorithms. As for the variability, effective diameter, sphericity, entropy, and GLCM entropy were the most robust features (CV≤5%). Inter-reader variability was larger than intra-reader or inter-reconstruction algorithm variability in 9 features. However, for entropy, homogeneity, and 4 GLCM-based features, inter-reconstruction algorithm variability was significantly greater than inter-reader variability (p<0.013).Most of the radiomic features were significantly affected by the reconstruction algorithms. Inter-reconstruction algorithm variability was greater than inter-reader variability for entropy, homogeneity, and GLCM-based features."

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the most abundant neurotrophin in the brain, is primarily produced by neurons, and BDNF levels are rapidly and strongly regulated by neuronal activity (Edelmann et al., 2014Edelmann E.

In particular, synaptic modifications induced by defined activity patterns, such as theta-burst stimulation (TBS), are associated with an increase in BDNF synthesis at both transcriptional and translational levels and in BDNF secretion, which regulate fine spatial-temporal availability of the neurotrophin. It has been proposed that BDNF actions depend upon it being released as precursor (proBDNF) or as mature BDNF protein, as these two different neurotrophin isoforms exhibit opposite effects on synaptic strength (Hempstead, 2015Hempstead B.L.

Following secretion, cleavage of proBDNF by tissue plasminogen activator (tPa)/plasmin in the extracellular milieu (Pang et al., 2004Pang P.T. Teng H.K. Zaitsev E. Woo N.T. Sakata K. Zhen S. Teng K.K. Yung W.-H. Hempstead B.L. Lu B. Cleavage of proBDNF by tPA/plasmin is essential for long-term hippocampal plasticity.Science. 2004; 306: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar) can also occur, leading to mature BDNF release and LTP maintenance. These properties suggest that expression and secretion of the different BDNF isoforms is highly regulated and proBDNF processing at synaptic sites can control plasticity (Greenberg et al., 2009Greenberg M.E. Xu B. Lu B. Hempstead B.L. New insights in the biology of BDNF synthesis and release: implications in CNS function.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12764-12767Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have moved away from the typical target of activity-dependent BDNF secretion (neurons) and have instead investigated the role of glial cells in regulating synaptic trafficking of the neurotrophin following LTP-inducing electrical stimulation. Remarkably, we found that peri-synaptic glia uses p75NTR to clear proBDNF secreted from neurons and responds to neuronal activation by re-secreting proBDNF as mature neurotrophin. As a consequence of BDNF glial recycling, we observed sustained activation of TrkB on adjacent neurons required for LTP maintenance. A central hypothesis arising from this recycling pathway is that BDNF actively participates in gliotransmission and astrocytes can contribute to synaptic plasticity by modulating BDNF availability in tune with synaptic needs. Indeed, glial cells are integral to the chemical synapse, contribute to structural and functional synaptic plasticity, and play a role in the formation of new memories (Allen and Barres, 2005Allen N.J.

In accord with the physiological properties of glial cells, we showed that BDNF glial recycling in the perirhinal cortex plays a major role in modulating cognitive behavior as visual recognition memory. Our results uncover a previously unsuspected role of cortical glial cells in regulating BDNF availability at synaptic contacts critically affecting long-term plasticity and memory consolidation. We used tamoxifen-inducible conditional p75lox/lox-GLAST-CreERT2-R26R mutant mice (Zuccaro et al., 2014Zuccaro E. Bergami M. Vignoli B. Bony G. Pierchala B.A. Santi S. Cancedda L. Canossa M. Polarized expression of p75(NTR) specifies axons during development and adult neurogenesis.Cell Rep. 2014; 7: 138-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (for simplicity, p75-flox mice) to selectively delete glial p75NTR (Figures S1A–S1C, available online), the carrier receptor for proBDNF uptake by astrocytes (Bergami et al., 2008Bergami M. Santi S. Formaggio E. Cagnoli C. Verderio C. Blum R. Berninger B. Matteoli M. Canossa M. Uptake and recycling of pro-BDNF for transmitter-induced secretion by cortical astrocytes.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We then observed the effects of glial p75NTR deletion on LTP in cortical slices from p75-flox mice and control littermates 14 days post-tamoxifen (dptm). This timing allows for a reliable depletion of p75NTR levels following Cre recombination in glial cells (Figure S1D). LTP was induced applying TBS (100 Hz; four sets of stimulations delivered 15 s apart, each one consisting of ten bursts of five pulses at 100 Hz with inter-burst intervals of 150 ms) in layer II/III of perirhinal cortices. LTP induction and maintenance were analyzed at 60 and 180 min after stimulus, respectively. In slices from control mice, TBS induced an increase in field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) amplitude (Figure 1A) and slope (Figure S2A) that remained potentiated above baseline for the 3 hr duration of the recording. In marked contrast, TBS in slices from p75-flox mice induced only a short-lived potentiation that declined to baseline about 140 min after stimulation. Thus, glial deletion of p75NTR affected the late-phase LTP. When TBS was applied in slices from p75-flox mice not induced with tamoxifen (Figure S1E), or 3 and 7 dptm before astrocytes exhibit metabolic depletion of pre-existing p75NTR (Figure S1F), no deficit in the late-phase LTP was observed, indicating that levels of p75NTR expression in glial cells are critical to sustain synaptic potentiation. To firmly assess the requirement of glial p75NTR for LTP maintenance, we performed rescue experiments by re-expressing p75NTR specifically in cortical astrocytes of p75-flox mice. We engineered a lentiviral construct (LV-p75stop) for conditional p75NTR expression under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV) (Figures S3A and S3B). In this construct, a loxP-eGFP-STOP-loxP cassette allows for GFP expression, while preventing p75NTR expression. The eGFP-STOP cassette is removed in the presence of Cre recombinase, resulting in loss of the GFP and activation of the p75NTR transgene. We injected the lentiviral particles into perirhinal cortices of p75-flox mice at 12 dptm (Figure 1B). Treating mice with tamoxifen for 2 additional days after injection ensures the expression of p75NTR in recombined astrocytes. In parallel, slices from injected mice were used for field recordings by placing the electrodes within the area of infection. Remarkably, rescuing p75NTR expression in glial cells of p75-flox mice by lentiviral expression completely restores the late-phase LTP deficit (Figures 1C and S2B). Injection of a control virus (LV-GFPstop) into the contralateral hemisphere of the same mice did not produce a similar effect. Here, fEPSPs declined back to baseline within 140 min after TBS. Overall, our results indicate that astroglial p75NTR is essential for LTP maintenance. Next, we asked whether p75NTR requires endogenous neurotrophin action to sustain LTP. We used a p75NTR function-blocking antibody (REX) (Mischel et al., 2001Mischel P.S. Smith S.G. Vining E.R. Valletta J.S. Mobley W.C. Reichardt L.F. The extracellular domain of p75NTR is necessary to inhibit neurotrophin-3 signaling through TrkA.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11294-11301Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) known to prevent the binding of neurotrophins to p75NTR. Slices from wild-type mice were treated with REX (50 mg/mL) before and throughout the recording time (Woo et al., 2005Woo N.H. Teng H.K. Siao C.-J. Chiaruttini C. Pang P.T. Milner T.A. Hempstead B.L. Lu B. Activation of p75NTR by proBDNF facilitates hippocampal long-term depression.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1069-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Consistent with a neurotrophin-mediated effect, perfusion with the REX antibody resulted in a short-term potentiation that declined within 140 min following stimulation (Figures 1D and S2C). In contrast, vehicle-treated slices of wild-type mice show normal LTP. These results indicate a selective role of p75NTR in the neurotrophin-dependent form of LTP. Induction of LTD in the hippocampus requires p75NTR expression (Rösch et al., 2005Rösch H. Schweigreiter R. Bonhoeffer T. Barde Y.-A. Korte M. The neurotrophin receptor p75NTR modulates long-term depression and regulates the expression of AMPA receptor subunits in the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Activation of p75NTR by proBDNF facilitates hippocampal long-term depression.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1069-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), but whether glial p75NTR is implicated in this form of synaptic plasticity is not known. To address this issue, we monitored LTD by applying a prolonged train (10 min) of low-frequency stimulations (LFSs; 5 Hz, 3,000 pulses) to cortical slices from p75-flox mice and control littermates (Figures 2A, S2D, and S2E). LFS induced an initial decrease in fEPSP amplitude that persisted for the 180 min recording time in both genotypes. Conversely, slices perfused with REX antibody showed a decrease in fEPSP that rapidly recovered back to baseline. Thus, our data confirm the requirement of p75NTR in cortical LTD, but clearly indicate that glial expression of the receptor is dispensable for both LTD induction and maintenance. ProBDNF binds and activates the p75NTR receptor (Teng et al., 2005Teng H.K. Teng K.K. Lee R. Wright S. Tevar S. Almeida R.D. Kermani P. Torkin R. Chen Z.Y. Lee F.S. et al.ProBDNF induces neuronal apoptosis via activation of a receptor complex of p75NTR and sortilin.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) facilitating LTD induction (Woo et al., 2005Woo N.H. Teng H.K. Siao C.-J. Chiaruttini C. Pang P.T. Milner T.A. Hempstead B.L.

Mark W. et al.proBDNF negatively regulates neuronal remodeling, synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity in hippocampus.Cell Rep. 2014; 7: 796-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To determine if glial p75NTR mediates LTD facilitation elicited by proBDNF, the effects of a mutated form of proBDNF resistant to proteolysis (proBDNFCR) were evaluated in cortical slices using a shorter LFS (5 Hz, 1,950 pulses, 6.5 min) (Figures 2B, S2F, and S2G). This weak stimulation did not induce LTD in vehicle-treated slices; in contrast, perfusion of proBDNFCR significantly enhanced LTD in slices from p75-flox mice and control littermates. Hence, proBDNFCR is facilitating LTD by binding to p75NTR receptors other than from the glial compartment. We speculated that requirement of glial p75NTR in LTP may be linked to its ability to promote proBDNF uptake (Bergami et al., 2008Bergami M. Santi S. Formaggio E. Cagnoli C. Verderio C. Blum R. Berninger B. Matteoli M. Canossa M. Uptake and recycling of pro-BDNF for transmitter-induced secretion by cortical astrocytes.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), supplying glial cells with a releasable source of the neurotrophin and enabling LTP. This implies that proBDNF is transferred from neurons to astrocytes in response to TBS, where it remains localized in vesicular structures proximal to the synapse. We investigated this scenario at light microscopic and ultra-structural levels. To determine the intracellular localization of proBDNF in astrocytes, we performed immunostaining in cortical slices by using specific antibodies (Figure S4) selectively recognizing the precursor (α-proBDNF) or both precursor and mature forms (α-BDNF) of the neurotrophin (Figure 3A). Slices were prepared from mice previously injected with a lentivirus transducing GFP in glial cells. GFP is a cytosolic protein whose fluorescence defines the astrocyte in its entire cytoplasmic extension, a feature that is ideal for co-localization analysis. Confocal imaging and 3D reconstruction detected co-localization of proBDNF and GFP immunoreactivity (proBDNF/GFP), revealing the presence of low levels of proBDNF in single astrocytes from non-stimulated control slices (Figure 3C). Co-localization increased 10 min after TBS. This timing was chosen as it correlates with the duration of endogenous BDNF secretion that is required for LTP maintenance in this cortical area (Aicardi et al., 2004Aicardi G. Argilli E. Cappello S. Santi S. Riccio M. Thoenen H. Canossa M. Induction of long-term potentiation and depression is reflected by corresponding changes in secretion of endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 15788-15792Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In line with proBDNF being transferred from neurons to astrocytes, we found that proBDNF is high in the periphery of glial cells and concentrated at the margins of neuron-astrocyte contacts. Co-localization using an α-BDNF antibody showed a similar expression pattern (Figure S5). In contrast, astrocytes from p75-flox mice showed very low, if any, proBDNF/GFP co-localization (Figure 3C). A final quantitative analysis revealed that proBDNF/GFP co-localization levels increased in stimulated versus non-stimulated slices from control mice; however, p75-flox mice showed the same levels of co-localization in both conditions (Figure 3B). While the increase of endocytic proBDNF in glial cells appears to be modest when confronted with the whole cell volume, the same increase is considerably high taking into account that proBDNF is predominantly regionalized in the cell periphery. Subcellular localization of proBDNF in glial cells was further resolved in super-resolution using 3D structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) (Figure 3D). In the cell body, proBDNF/GFP signal shows a clear vesicular pattern reminiscent of endocytic vesicles (Bergami et al., 2008Bergami M. Santi S. Formaggio E. Cagnoli C. Verderio C. Blum R. Berninger B. Matteoli M. Canossa M. Uptake and recycling of pro-BDNF for transmitter-induced secretion by cortical astrocytes.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whereas in the cell periphery, most of the signal was punctate and distributed at astrocyte endfeet. Typically, astrocytes are highly branched cells with many small protrusions that contact the synaptic cleft (Reichenbach et al., 2010Reichenbach A. Derouiche A. Kirchhoff F. Morphology and dynamics of perisynaptic glia.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2010; 63: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Given the nanometer scale resolution of the 3D-SIM (115 nm x-y), our data suggest a synaptic localization of the neurotrophin. To explore this possibility, ultra-thin sections were examined by transmission electron microscopy in pre-embedding experiments upon immunogold labeling with α-proBDNF or α-BDNF (Dieni et al., 2012Dieni S. Matsumoto T. Dekkers M. Rauskolb S. Ionescu M.S. Deogracias R. Gundelfinger E.D. Kojima M. Nestel S. Frotscher M. Barde Y.A. BDNF and its pro-peptide are stored in presynaptic dense core vesicles in brain neurons.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In sections from non-stimulated slices, gold particles were primarily seen in vesicular structures at pre-synaptic terminals (75% ± 7% pre-synaptic, 8% ± 2% post-synaptic, and 17% ± 3% astrocytic; or 68% ± 9% pre-synaptic, 18% ± 3% post-synaptic, and 14% ± 6% astrocytic of the total gold particle detected using α-proBDNF or α-BDNF, respectively), typically displaying clouds of synaptic vesicles proximal to postsynaptic density structures (Figure 4A). Following TBS, gold particles maintained their pre-synaptic localization, but were also clearly found in postsynaptic terminals and glial cells closely interacting with these synaptic complexes (34% ± 7% pre-synaptic, 20% ± 7% post-synaptic, and 46% ± 8% astrocytic; or 35% ± 7% pre-synaptic, 29% ± 3% post-synaptic, and 36% ± 4% astrocytic of the total gold particle detected using α-proBDNF or α-BDNF, respectively). While proBDNF in postsynaptic sites might be acquired from many different sources (i.e., local synthesis, synaptic transport, or internalization), its increase in glial cells (non-stimulated versus TBS-stimulated, unpaired t test, p = 0.0374 or p = 0.0189 using α-proBDNF or α-BDNF, respectively) implies that the neurotrophin is transferred from axon terminals to the neighboring glia. Accordingly, gold particles observed in stimulated slices appear contained in vesicle-like structures in proximity of the pre-synaptic membrane and contacting glia (Figure 4B). Most immunogold particles in glial cells (38% or 48% of the total gold particles detected in astrocytes using α-proBDNF or α-BDNF, respectively) were localized at peri-synaptic sites in a membrane-delimited area of 230 nm radius surrounding synaptic contacts (Figure 4A). At 70,000- to 100,000-fold magnification, immunogold labeling with both antibodies of this area revealed a subset of distinct aggregates of gold grains and, sporadically, single gold particles in vesicular structures (Figures 4B and 4C). We conclude that a significant pool of proBDNF-containing endocytic vesicles is created at peri-synaptic glia in response to TBS. To obtain further insight into the intracellular storage and sorting of endocytic vesicles containing proBDNF/p75NTR in astrocytes, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy was used to track single vesicles in real time. Cultured cortical astrocytes were transfected with p75NTR tagged with GFP (p75-GFP) for evanescent light excitation of p75-GFP residing within or in close proximity to the plasma membrane. Cells were exposed to proBDNF immunocomplexed with quantum dots (proBDNF-QDs) (Bergami et al., 2008Bergami M. Santi S. Formaggio E. Cagnoli C. Verderio C. Blum R. Berninger B. Matteoli M. Canossa M. Uptake and recycling of pro-BDNF for transmitter-induced secretion by cortical astrocytes.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) displaying the appearance of endocitic vesicles containing p75-GFP/proBDNF-QD complexes (Figures 5A–5F). Endocytic vesicles in juxtamembrane regions of the astrocyte showed a number of dynamic events: vesicles in active motion are confined at the site of internalization (Figure 5A) in thin (Figure 5B) or large (Figure 5C) membrane protrusions; alternatively, vesicles are transported for a short distance (Figure 5D). Thus, endocytic vesicles show limited trafficking and tend to localize at cell membrane margins delimiting the astrocyte endfeet. Moreover, we observed individual endocytic vesicles fusing each other into a larger vesicle (Figure 5E), which is in line with the presence of proBDNF aggregates observed by electron microscopy. Next, we investigated whether endocytic vesicles containing p75-GFP/proBDNF-QD complex can eventually be recycled for exocytic fusion. Challenging astrocytes with glutamate (500 μM) disclosed proBDNF-QD release (Figure 5F). Only when p75-GFP fluorescence, which is normally concentrated at the site of proBDNF-QDs displaying orange fluorescence, vanishes and the proBDNF-QDs gain their original red fluorescence is it considered an exocytic event. Thus, endocytic vesicles containing p75NTR/proBDNF represent the main storage compartment for the neurotrophin before routing to the secretory pathway. Functional implication for proBDNF glial recycling is that glial cells can release the neurotrophin in response to TBS, which fulfills the function to mediate the switch from early to late-phase LTP. To address this cellular property, we injected p75-flox mice with a lentivirus-transducing proBDNF (LV-proBDNFstop) selectively in glial cells. We speculated that an ectopic source of proBDNF in p75NTR-deficient astrocytes could replenish endocytic proBDNF and compensate for the lack of recycling in these cells, thereby restoring late-phase LTP deficits (Figure 6A). Pre-requisite for this mechanism is the evidence that in cultured astrocytes, endocytic and newly synthesized proBDNF are comparably secreted (Figure S6). In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that glial expression of proBDNF led to a complete rescue of the late-phase LTP, whereas mice injected in the contralateral hemisphere with control LV-GFPstop virus showed no effect (Figures 6B and S2H). LV-proBDNFstop rescued the late-phase LTP deficit also when elicited by REX antibody in slices from control mice (Figure S7A). Thus, supplying glial cells with ectopic proBDNF compensates for the physiological requirement of neurotrophin recycling. Given that mature BDNF, and not proBDNF, is well documented to act as an LTP mediator (Pang et al., 2004Pang P.T. Teng H.K. Zaitsev E. Woo N.T. Sakata K. Zhen S. Teng K.K. Yung W.-H. Hempstead B.L.

Mark W. et al.proBDNF negatively regulates neuronal remodeling, synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity in hippocampus.Cell Rep. 2014; 7: 796-806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we predict that transduced proBDNF undergoes intracellular or extracellular conversion to mature neurotrophin in order to restore the late-phase LTP. Our hypothesis was confirmed by injecting lentivirus-transducing cleavage-resistant proBDNFCR (LV-proBDNFCRstop). In slices from p75-flox mice (Figures 6C and S2I) or control mice treated with REX (Figure S7A), proBDNFCR sourced by astrocytes could not produce a rescue of the phenotype. Our data indicate that processing of proBDNF sourced by glia is required for LTP maintenance and suggest a mechanistic link between proBDNF clearing and subsequent recycling as mature neurotrophin in response to synaptic potentiation. To demonstrate that mature BDNF is sufficient for this effect, slices from p75-flox mice were perfused with BDNF (100 ng/mL) for 10 min following TBS. Exogenous application of the neurotrophin restored the late-phase LTP deficit induced by p75NTR deletion (Figures 6D and S2L) or inhibition by REX (Figure S7B). In contrast, application of proBDNFCR (100 ng/mL) failed to restore the late-phase LTP deficits in both conditions (Figures 6D and S7B). While we cannot exclude that other factors triggered by p75NTR may exist and play a role in LTP maintenance, these are not essential to mediate the late-phase LTP, as we demonstrated for BDNF. Finally, we showed that mature BDNF applied between 20 and 60 min after TBS was ineffective (Figures 6D and S2M), indicating that BDNF is required for a limited time window to sustain LTP and that glial recycling is sufficient to satisfy this temporal requirement. Glial recycling and processing of proBDNF would result in highly localized activation of TrkB receptors on adjacent neurons. To assess this issue, we examined the phosphorylated TrkB (p-TrkB) profile at different time points after TBS in cortical slices from p75-flox mice and control littermates (Figure 7C) by using α-p-TrkB specific antibody (Figure S8A). Pre-requisite for this analysis is the evidence that in control slices, p-TrkB is virtually absent from glial cells (4.8% p-TrkB/GFP co-localization) (Figure 7A), which we"

https://openalex.org/W2530180312,"To investigate the relationship between two distinct measures of disability: self-reported functional limitations and objectively-screened clinical impairments.We undertook an all age population-based survey of disability in two areas: North-West Cameroon (August/October 2013) and Telangana State, India (Feb/April 2014). Participants were selected for inclusion via two-stage cluster randomised sampling (probability proportionate to size cluster selection and compact segment sampling within clusters). Disability was defined as the presence of self-reported functional limitations across eight domains, or presence of moderate or greater clinical impairments. Clinical impairment screening comprised of visual acuity testing for vision impairment, pure tone audiometry for hearing impairment, musculoskeletal functioning assessment for musculoskeletal impairment, reported seizure history for epilepsy and reported symptoms of clinical depression (depression adults only). Information was collected using structured questionnaires, observations and examinations.Self-reported disability prevalence was 5.9% (95% CI 4.7-7.4) and 7.5% (5.9-9.4) in Cameroon and India respectively. The prevalence of moderate or greater clinical impairments in the same populations were 8.4% (7.5-9.4) in Cameroon and 10.5% (9.4-11.7) in India. Overall disability prevalence (self-report and/or screened positive to a moderate or greater clinical impairment) was 10.5% in Cameroon and 12.2% in India, with limited overlap between the sub-populations identified using the two types of tools. 33% of participants in Cameroon identified to have a disability, and 45% in India, both reported functional limitations and screened positive to objectively-screened impairments, whilst the remainder were identified via one or other tool only. A large proportion of people with moderate or severe clinical impairments did not self-report functional difficulties despite reporting participation restrictions.Tools to assess reported functional limitation alone are insufficient to identify all persons with participation restrictions and moderate or severe clinical impairments. A self-reported functional limitation tool followed by clinical screening of all those who report any level of difficulty would identify 94% of people with disabilities in Cameroon and 95% in India, meeting the study criteria."

Our recordings from neocortical layer II/III of freely behaving rats revealed field potential events at ripple and high-gamma frequencies repeatedly occurring at troughs of spindle oscillations during sleep. Juxtacellular recordings identified subpopulations of fast-spiking, parvalbumin-containing basket cells with epochs of firing at ripple (∼200 Hz) and high-gamma (∼120 Hz) frequencies detected during spindles and centered with millisecond precision at the trough of spindle waves in phase with field potential events but phase shifted relative to pyramidal cell firing. The results suggest that basket cell subpopulations are involved in spindle-nested, high-frequency network events that hypothetically provide repeatedly occurring neocortical temporal reference states potentially involved in mnemonic processes."

We investigated the relationship between daily physical activity level and plasma metabolites using a targeted metabolomics approach in a population-based study. Methods A total of 1,193 participants (male, aged 35 to 74 years) with fasting blood samples were selected from the baseline survey of a cohort study. Information on daily total physical activity, classified into four levels by quartile of metabolic equivalent scores, and sedentary behavior, defined as hours of sitting per day, was collected through a self-administered questionnaire. Plasma metabolite concentrations were quantified by capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry method. We performed linear regression analysis models with multivariable adjustment and corrected p-values for multiple testing in the original population (n = 808). The robustness of the results was confirmed by replication analysis in a separate population (n = 385) created by random allocation. Results Higher levels of total physical activity were associated with various metabolite concentrations, including lower concentrations of amino acids and their derivatives, and higher concentrations of pipecolate (FDR p <0.05 in original population). The findings persisted after adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, and energy intake. Isoleucine, leucine, valine, 4-methyl-2-oxoisopentanoate, 2-oxoisopentanoate, alanine, and proline concentrations were lower with a shorter sitting time. Conclusions Physical activity is related to various plasma metabolites, including known biomarkers for future insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. These metabolites might potentially play a key role in the protective effects of higher physical activity and/or less sedentary behavior on non-communicable diseases."

Compared to the better known lepidopteran species which use Type-I pheromones, little is known at the molecular level about the olfactory mechanisms of host location and mate choice in H. cunea, a species using Type-II lepidopteran pheromones. In the present study, the H. cunea antennal transcriptome was constructed by Illumina Hiseq 2500TM sequencing, with the aim of discovering olfaction-related genes. We obtained 64,020,776 clean reads, and 59,243 unigenes from the analysis of the transcriptome, and the putative gene functions were annotated using gene ontology (GO) annotation. We further identified 124 putative chemosensory unigenes based on homology searches and phylogenetic analysis, including 30 odorant binding proteins (OBPs), 17 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 52 odorant receptors (ORs), 14 ionotropic receptors (IRs), nine gustatory receptors (GRs) and two sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs). We also found many conserved motif patterns of OBPs and CSPs using a MEME system. Moreover, we systematically analyzed expression patterns of OBPs and CSPs based on reverse transcription PCR and quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR) with RNA extracted from different tissues and life stages of both sexes in H. cunea. The antennae-biased expression may provide a deeper further understanding of olfactory processing in H. cunea. The first ever identification of olfactory genes in H. cunea may provide new leads for control of this major pest."

Its enzymatic synthesis is an environmentally friendly alternative to the use of harsh oxidants and extremely acidic conditions. 7D5L, a high-redox potential laccase developed in our lab, is the biocatalyst of choice for the synthesis of green polyaniline (emeraldine salt) due to its superior ability to oxidize aniline and kinetic stability at the required polymerization conditions (pH 3 and presence of anionic surfactants) as compared with other fungal laccases. Doses as low as 7.6 nM of 7D5L catalyze the polymerization of 15 mM aniline (in 24 h, room temperature, 7% yield) in the presence of different anionic surfactants used as doping templates to provide linear and water-soluble polymers. Aniline polymerization was monitored by the increase of the polaron absorption band at 800 nm (typical for emeraldine salt). Best polymerization results were obtained with 5 mM sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) as template. At fixed conditions (15 mM aniline and 5mM SDBS), polymerization rates obtained with 7D5L were 2.5-fold the rates obtained with commercial Trametes villosa laccase. Moreover, polyaniline yield was notably boosted to 75% by rising 7D5L amount to 0.15 μM, obtaining 1g of green polyaniline in 1L-reaction volume. The green polymer obtained with the selected system (7D5L/SDBS) holds excellent electrochemical and electro-conductive properties displayed in water-dispersible nanofibers, which is advantageous for the nanomaterial to be readily cast into uniform films for different applications."

Cardiovascular autonomic function tests were performed using the following heart rate variability parameters: expiration-to-inspiration ratio, response to Valsalva maneuver and standing. We estimated the recurrence of CVD events during the follow-up period. A total of 159 (77.2%) of the 206 patients enrolled completed the follow up, and 78 (49.1%) patients had recurrent episodes of CVD, with an incidence rate of 75.6 per 1,000 patient-years. The mean age and diabetes duration were 62.5 ± 8.7 and 9.2 ± 6.9 years, respectively. Patients who developed recurrent CVD also exhibited hypertension (P = 0.004), diabetic nephropathy (P = 0.012), higher mean systolic blood pressure (P = 0.006), urinary albumin excretion (P = 0.015), and mean triglyceride level (P = 0.035) than did patients without recurrent CVD. Multivariable Cox hazard regression analysis revealed that definite CAN was significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrent CVD (hazard ratio [HR] 3.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-6.60; P = 0.005).

A putative laccase-like gene, laclK, encoding a protein of 29.3 kDa and belonging to the Cu-oxidase_4 superfamily, was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant protein LaclK (LaclK) was able to oxidize typical laccase substrates such as 2,6-dimethoxyphenol and l-dopamine. The characteristic adsorption maximums of typical laccases at 330 nm and 610 nm were not detected for LaclK. Cu2+ was essential for substrate oxidation, but the ratio of copper atoms/molecule of LaclK was determined to only be 1:1. Notably, the optimal temperature of LaclK was 85°C with 2,6-dimethoxyphenol as substrates, and the half-life approximately 3 days at 80°C. Furthermore, 10% (v/v) organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, Triton x-100 or dimethyl sulfoxide) could promote enzymatic activity. LaclK exhibited wide-spectrum decolorization ability towards triphenylmethane dyes, azo dyes and aromatic dyes, decolorizing 92% and 94% of Victoria Blue B (25 μM) and Ethyl Violet (25 μM), respectively, at a concentration of 60 U/L after 1 h of incubation at 60°C. Overall, we characterized a novel thermostable and organic solvent-tolerant copper-containing polyphenol oxidase possessing dye-decolorizing ability. These unusual properties make LaclK an alternative for industrial applications, particularly processes that require high-temperature conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2531035388,"Lung M2 macrophages are regulators of airway inflammation, associated with poor lung function in allergic asthma. Previously, we demonstrated that IL-4-induced M2 gene expression correlated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) in macrophages. We hypothesized that negative regulation of IRS-2 activity after IL-4 stimulation is dependent upon serine phosphorylation of IRS-2. Herein, we describe an inverse relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation (Tyr(P)) and serine phosphorylation (Ser(P)) of IRS-2 after IL-4 stimulation. Inhibiting serine phosphatase activity increased Ser(P)-IRS-2 and decreased Tyr(P)-IRS-2 leading to reduced M2 gene expression (CD200R, CCL22, MMP12, and TGM2). We found that inhibition of p70S6K, downstream of TORC1, resulted in diminished Ser(P)-IRS-2 and prolonged Tyr(P)-IRS-2 as well. Inhibition of p70S6K increased expression of CD200R and CCL22 indicating that p70S6K negatively regulates some, but not all, human M2 genes. Knocking down GRB10, another negative regulatory protein downstream of TORC1, enhanced both Tyr(P)-IRS-2 and increased expression of all four M2 genes. Furthermore, GRB10 associated with IRS-2, NEDD4.2 (an E3-ubiquitin ligase), IL-4Rα, and γC after IL-4 stimulation. Both IL-4Rα and γC were ubiquitinated after 30 min of IL-4 treatment, suggesting that GRB10 may regulate degradation of the IL-4 receptor-signaling complex through interactions with NEDD4.2. Taken together, these data highlight two novel regulatory proteins that could be therapeutically manipulated to limit IL-4-induced IRS-2 signaling and polarization of M2 macrophages in allergic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2531471933,Puroindoline (Pina and Pinb) genes control grain texture or hardness in wheat. Wild-type/soft alleles lead to softer grain while a mutation in one or both of these genes results in a hard grain. Variation in hardness in genotypes with identical Pin alleles (wild-type or mutant) is known but the molecular basis of this is not known. We now report the identification of wheat genotypes with hard grain texture and wild-type/soft Pin alleles indicating that hardness in wheat may be controlled by factors other than mutations in the coding region of the Pin genes. RNA-Seq analysis was used to determine the variation in the transcriptome of developing grains of thirty three diverse wheat genotypes including hard (mutant Pin) and soft (wild type) and those that were hard without having Pin mutations. This defined the role of pin gene expression and identified other candidate genes associated with hardness. Pina was not expressed in hard wheat with a mutation in the Pina gene. The ratio of Pina to Pinb expression was generally lower in the hard non mutant genotypes. Hardness may be associated with differences in Pin expression and other factors and is not simply associated with mutations in the PIN protein coding sequences.
https://openalex.org/W2530270106,"In contrast to G protein-coupled receptors, for which chemical and peptidic inhibitors have been extensively explored, few compounds are available that directly modulate heterotrimeric G proteins. Active Gαq binds its two major classes of effectors, the phospholipase C (PLC)-β isozymes and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) related to Trio, in a strikingly similar fashion: a continuous helix-turn-helix of the effectors engages Gαq within its canonical binding site consisting of a groove formed between switch II and helix α3. This information was exploited to synthesize peptides that bound active Gαq in vitro with affinities similar to full-length effectors and directly competed with effectors for engagement of Gαq. A representative peptide was specific for active Gαq because it did not bind inactive Gαq or other classes of active Gα subunits and did not inhibit the activation of PLC-β3 by Gβ1γ2. In contrast, the peptide robustly prevented activation of PLC-β3 or p63RhoGEF by Gαq; it also prevented G protein-coupled receptor-promoted neuronal depolarization downstream of Gαq in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Moreover, a genetically encoded form of this peptide flanked by fluorescent proteins inhibited Gαq-dependent activation of PLC-β3 at least as effectively as a dominant-negative form of full-length PLC-β3. These attributes suggest that related, cell-penetrating peptides should effectively inhibit active Gαq in cells and that these and genetically encoded sequences may find application as molecular probes, drug leads, and biosensors to monitor the spatiotemporal activation of Gαq in cells."

In order to survive in diverse environments, they have evolved distinct feeding strategies and they can use different food sources. While some nematodes are specialists, including parasites of plants and animals, others such as Pristionchus pacificus are omnivorous feeders, which can live on a diet of bacteria, protozoans, fungi or yeast. In the wild, P. pacificus is often found in a necromenic association with beetles and is known to be able to feed on a variety of microbes as well as on nematode prey. However, in laboratory studies Escherichia coli OP50 has been used as standard food source, similar to investigations in Caenorhabditis elegans and it is unclear to what extent this biases the obtained results and how relevant findings are in real nature. To gain first insight into the variation in traits induced by a non-bacterial food source, we study Pristionchus-fungi interactions under laboratory conditions. After screening different yeast strains, we were able to maintain P. pacificus for at least 50-60 generations on Cryptococcus albidus and Cryptococcus curvatus. We describe life history traits of P. pacificus on both yeast strains, including developmental timing, survival and brood size. Despite a slight developmental delay and problems to digest yeast cells, which are both reflected at a transcriptomic level, all analyses support the potential of Cryptococcus strains as food source for P. pacificus. In summary, our work establishes two Cryptococcus strains as alternative food source for P. pacificus and shows change in various developmental, physiological and morphological traits, including the transcriptomic profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2531200293,"Disturbance regimes are changing worldwide, and the consequences for ecosystem function and resilience are largely unknown. Functional diversity (FD) provides a surrogate measure of ecosystem function by capturing the range, abundance and distribution of trait values in a community. Enhanced understanding of the responses of FD to measures of vegetation structure at landscape scales is needed to guide conservation management. To address this knowledge gap, we used a whole-of-landscape sampling approach to examine relationships between bird FD, vegetation diversity and time since fire. We surveyed birds and measured vegetation at 36 landscape sampling units in dry and wet forest in southeast Australia during 2010 and 2011. Four uncorrelated indices of bird FD (richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion) were derived from six bird traits, and we investigated responses of these indices and species richness to both vertical and horizontal vegetation diversity using linear mixed models. We also considered the extent to which the mean and diversity of time since fire were related to vegetation diversity. Results showed opposing responses of FD to vegetation diversity in dry and wet forest. In dry forest, where fire is frequent, species richness and two FD indices (richness and dispersion) were positively related to vertical vegetation diversity, consistent with theory relating to environmental variation and coexistence. However, in wet forest subject to infrequent fire, the same three response variables were negatively associated with vertical diversity. We suggest that competitive dominance by species results in lower FD as vegetation diversity increases in wet forest. The responses of functional evenness were opposite to those of species richness, functional richness and dispersion in both forest types, highlighting the value of examining multiple FD metrics at management-relevant scales. The mean and diversity of time since fire were uncorrelated with vegetation diversity in wet forest, but positively correlated with vegetation diversity in dry forest. We therefore suggest that protection of older vegetation is important, but controlled application of low-severity fire in dry forest may sustain ecosystem function by enhancing different elements of FD."
https://openalex.org/W2531520184,"Cross-neutralising monoclonal antibodies against influenza hemagglutinin (HA) are of considerable interest as both therapeutics and diagnostic tools. We have recently described five different single domain antibodies (nanobodies) which share this cross-neutralising activity and suggest their small size, high stability, and cleft binding properties may present distinct advantages over equivalent conventional antibodies. We have used yeast display in combination with deep mutational scanning to give residue level resolution of positions in the antibody-HA interface which are crucial for binding. In addition, we have mapped positions within HA predicted to have minimal effect on antibody binding when mutated. Our cross-neutralising nanobodies were shown to bind to a highly conserved pocket in the HA2 domain of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus overlapping with the fusion peptide suggesting their mechanism of action is through the inhibition of viral membrane fusion. We also note that the epitope overlaps with that of CR6261 and F10 which are human monoclonal antibodies in clinical development as immunotherapeutics. Although all five nanobodies mapped to the same highly conserved binding pocket we observed differences in the size of the epitope footprint which has implications in comparing the relative genetic barrier each nanobody presents to a rapidly evolving influenza virus. To further refine our epitope map, we have re-created naturally occurring mutations within this HA stem epitope and tested their effect on binding using yeast display. We have shown that a D46N mutation in the HA2 stem domain uniquely interferes with binding of R2b-E8. Further testing of this substitution in the context of full length purified HA from 1918 H1N1 pandemic (Spanish flu), 2009 H1N1 pandemic (swine flu) and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 demonstrated binding which correlated with D46 whereas binding to seasonal H1N1 strains carrying N46 was absent. In addition, our deep sequence analysis predicted that binding to the emerging H1N1 strain (A/Christchurch/16/2010) carrying the HA2-E47K mutation would not affect binding was confirmed experimentally. This demonstrates yeast display, in combination with deep sequencing, may be able to predict antibody reactivity to emerging influenza strains so assisting in the preparation for future influenza pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W2530137113,"The aim of this study was to produce epithelial attachment on a typical implant abutment surface of smooth titanium. A challenging complication that hinders the success of dental implants is peri-implantitis. A common cause of peri-implantitis may results from the lack of epithelial sealing at the peri-implant collar. Histologically, epithelial sealing is recognized as the attachment of the basement membrane (BM). BM-attachment is promoted by activated platelet aggregates at surgical wound sites. On the other hand, platelets did not aggregate on smooth titanium, the surface typical of the implant abutment. We then hypothesized that epithelial BM-attachment was produced when titanium surface was modified to allow platelet aggregation. Titanium surfaces were coated with a protease activated receptor 4-activating peptide (PAR4-AP). PAR4-AP coating yielded rapid aggregation of platelets on the titanium surface. Platelet aggregates released robust amount of epithelial chemoattractants (IGF-I, TGF-β) and growth factors (EGF, VEGF) on the titanium surface. Human gingival epithelial cells, when they were co-cultured on the platelet aggregates, successfully attached to the PAR4-AP coated titanium surface with spread laminin5 positive BM and consecutive staining of the epithelial tight junction component ZO1, indicating the formation of complete epithelial sheet. These in-vitro results indicate the establishment of epithelial BM-attachment to the titanium surface."
https://openalex.org/W2530419171,"Background End-of-life decision-making in Intensive care Units (ICUs) is difficult. The main problems encountered are the lack of a reliable prediction score for death and the fact that the opinion of patients is rarely taken into consideration. The Decision Curve Analysis (DCA) is a recent method developed to evaluate the prediction models and which takes into account the wishes of patients (or surrogates) to expose themselves to the risk of obtaining a false result. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical usefulness, with DCA, of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) to predict ICU mortality. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study from January 2011 to September 2015, in a medical-surgical 23-bed ICU at University Hospital. Performances of the SAPS II, a modified SAPS II (without AGE), and age to predict ICU mortality, were measured by a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and DCA. Results Among the 4.370 patients admitted, 23.3% died in the ICU. Mean (standard deviation) age was 56.8 (16.7) years, and median (first-third quartile) SAPS II was 48 (34–65). Areas under ROC curves were 0.828 (0.813–0.843) for SAPS II, 0.814 (0.798–0.829) for modified SAPS II and of 0.627 (0.608–0.646) for age. DCA showed a net benefit whatever the probability threshold, especially under 0.5. Conclusion DCA shows the benefits of the SAPS II to predict ICU mortality, especially when the probability threshold is low. Complementary studies are needed to define the exact role that the SAPS II can play in end-of-life decision-making in ICUs."
https://openalex.org/W2530223967,"Background and Purpose Patients report similar or better pain and function before revision hip arthroplasty than before primary arthroplasty but worse results are reported after revision surgery than after primary surgery. The trajectory of post-operative recovery during the first months and any differences by type of surgery have received little attention. We explored the trajectories of change in pain and function after revision hip arthroplasty to 12-months post-operatively and compare them with those observed after primary hip arthroplasty. Methods This study is a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing primary (n = 80 with 92% for an indication of osteoarthritis) and revision (n = 43) hip arthroplasties. WOMAC pain and function scores and walking speed were collected pre-operatively, at 3 and 12-months post-operatively. Multilevel regression models were used to chart and compare the trajectories of change (0–3 months and 3–12 months) between types of surgery. Results The improvements in pain and function following revision arthroplasty occurred within the first 3-months with no evidence of further change beyond this initial period. While the pattern of recovery was similar to the one observed after primary arthroplasty, improvements in the first 3-months were smaller after revision compared to primary arthroplasty. Patients listed for revision surgery reported lower pre-operative pain levels but similar post-operative levels compared to those undergoing primary surgery. At 12-months post-operation patients who underwent a revision arthroplasty had not reached the same level of function achieved by those who underwent primary arthroplasty. Conclusion The post-operative improvements in pain and function are larger following primary hip arthroplasty than following revision hip arthroplasty. Irrespectively of surgery type, most of the improvements occur in the first three post-operative months. More research is required to identify whether the recovery following revision surgery could be improved with specific post-operative interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2531546215,"Argonaute (Ago) proteins from all three domains of life are key players in processes that specifically regulate cellular nucleic acid levels. Some of these Ago proteins, among them human Argonaute2 (hAgo2) and Ago from the archaeal organism Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjAgo), are able to cleave nucleic acid target strands that are recognised via an Ago-associated complementary guide strand. Here we present an in-depth kinetic side-by-side analysis of hAgo2 and MjAgo guide and target substrate binding as well as target strand cleavage, which enabled us to disclose similarities and differences in the mechanistic pathways as a function of the chemical nature of the substrate. Testing all possible guide-target combinations (i.e. RNA/RNA, RNA/DNA, DNA/RNA and DNA/DNA) with both Ago variants we demonstrate that the molecular mechanism of substrate association is highly conserved among archaeal-eukaryotic Argonautes. Furthermore, we show that hAgo2 binds RNA and DNA guide strands in the same fashion. On the other hand, despite striking homology between the two Ago variants, MjAgo cannot orientate guide RNA substrates in a way that allows interaction with the target DNA in a cleavage-compatible orientation."
https://openalex.org/W2530005507,"After disease resolution, a small subset of influenza specific CD8+ T cells can remain in the airways of the lung as a tissue resident memory population (TRM). These cells are critical for protection from subsequent infections with heterosubtypic influenza viruses. Although it is well established that expression of the collagen IV binding integrin alpha 1 is necessary for the retention and maintenance of TRM cells, other requirements allowing them to localize to the airways and persist are less well understood. We recently demonstrated that inhibition of neutrophils or neutrophil derived chemokine CXCL12 during acute influenza virus infection reduces the effector T cell response and affects the ability of these cells to localize to the airways. We therefore sought to determine whether the defects that occur in the absence of neutrophils would persist throughout resolution of the disease and impact the development of the TRM population. Interestingly, the early alterations in the CD8+ T cell response recover by two weeks post-infection, and mice form a protective population of TRM cells. Overall, these observations show that acute neutrophil depletion results in a delay in the effector CD8+ T cell response, but does not adversely impact the development of TRM."
https://openalex.org/W2531207417,"The relation between neighbourhood environmental factors and domain-specific sedentary behaviours among adults remains unclear. This study firstly aims to examine the association of perceived and objectively measured neighbourhood safety, aesthetics, destinations and functionality with transport-related, work-related and leisure-time sedentary behaviour. Secondly, the study aims to assess whether these associations are moderated by age, gender or educational level.In 60 randomly sampled neighbourhoods from 5 urban regions in Europe (Ghent and suburbs, Paris and inner suburbs, Budapest and suburbs, the Randstad, and Greater London), a virtual audit with Google Street View was performed to assess environmental characteristics. A total of 5,205 adult inhabitants of these neighbourhoods reported socio-demographic characteristics, sedentary behaviours, and neighbourhood perceptions in an online survey. Generalized linear mixed models were conducted to examine associations between physical environmental neighbourhood factors and sedentary behaviours. Interaction terms were added to test the moderating role of individual-level socio-demographic variables.Lower levels of leisure-time sedentary behaviour (i.e. all leisure activities except television viewing and computer use) were observed among adults who perceived greater numbers of destinations such as supermarkets, recreational facilities, or restaurants in their neighbourhood, and among adults who lived in a neighbourhood with more objectively measured aesthetic features, such as trees, water areas or public parks. Lower levels of work-related sedentary behaviour were observed among adults who perceived less aesthetic features in their neighbourhood, and among adults who lived in a neighbourhood with less objectively measured destinations. Both age, gender and educational level moderated the associations between neighbourhood environmental factors and sedentary behaviours.Preliminary evidence was found for associations between neighbourhood environmental factors and domain-specific sedentary behaviours among adults. However, these associations varied according to objective or subjective environmental measures. More research is needed to confirm and clarify the associations."
https://openalex.org/W2530024462,"The banana shrimp (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis) is one of the most commercially important penaeid species in the world. Its numbers are declining in the wild, leading to a loss of broodstock for farmers of the shrimp and a need for more successful breeding programs. However, the molecular mechanism of the genes involved in this shrimp's ovarian maturation is still unclear. Consequently, we compared transcriptomic profiles of ovarian tissue from females in both the vitellogenic stage and the non-vitellogenic stage. Using RNA-Seq technology to prepare the transcriptome libraries, a total of 12,187,412 and 11,694,326 sequencing reads were acquired from the non-vitellogenic and vitellogenic stages respectively. The analysis of the differentially expressed genes identified 1,025 which were significantly differentially expressed between the two stages, of which 694 were up-regulated and 331 down-regulated. Four genes putatively involved in the ovarian maturation pathway were chosen for validation by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). The data from this study provided information about gene expression in ovarian tissue of the banana shrimp which could be useful for a better understanding of the regulation of this species' reproductive cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2531206662,"Gumiganghwal-tang is a traditional herbal prescription that is used widely for the treatment of the common cold and inflammatory diseases in Korea and other Asian countries. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of a Gumiganghwal-tang aqueous extract (GGTA) against airway inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis using a mouse model of chronic asthma. Chronic asthma was modeled in BALB/c mice via sensitization/challenge with an intraperitoneal injection of 1% ovalbumin (OVA) and inhalation of nebulized 1% OVA for 4 weeks. GGTA (100 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg) was also administered by oral gavage once a day for 4 weeks. We investigated the number of inflammatory cells, production of T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines, chemokine and the total transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF); the levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the plasma; the infiltration of inflammatory cells in lung tissue; and the expression of TGF-β1, Smad-3, and collagen in lung tissue. Our results revealed that GGTA lowered the recruitment of inflammatory cells (particularly, lymphocyte); and decreased the production of Th2 cytokines, chemokine and total TGF-β1; and attenuated the levels of total and OVA-specific IgE; and decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells. Moreover, GGTA significantly reduced the expression of TGF-β1 and Smad-3, and lowered collagen deposition. These results indicate that GGTA reduces airway inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis by regulating Th2 cytokines production and the TGF-β1/Smad-3 pathway, thus providing a potential treatment for chronic asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2530034820,"The isolated apical domain of the Escherichia coli GroEL subunit displays the ability to suppress the irreversible fibrillation of numerous amyloid-forming polypeptides. In previous experiments, we have shown that mutating Gly-192 (located at hinge II that connects the apical domain and the intermediate domain) to a tryptophan results in an inactive chaperonin whose apical domain is disoriented. In this study, we have utilized this disruptive effect of Gly-192 mutation to our advantage, by substituting this residue with amino acid residues of varying van der Waals volumes with the intent to modulate the affinity of GroEL toward fibrillogenic peptides. The affinities of GroEL toward fibrillogenic polypeptides such as Aβ(1–40) (amyloid-β(1–40)) peptide and α-synuclein increased in accordance to the larger van der Waals volume of the substituent amino acid side chain in the G192X mutants. When we compared the effects of wild-type GroEL and selected GroEL G192X mutants on α-synuclein fibril formation, we found that the effects of the chaperonin on α-synuclein fibrillation were different; the wild-type chaperonin caused changes in both the initial lag phase and the rate of fibril extension, whereas the effects of the G192X mutants were more specific toward the nucleus-forming lag phase. The chaperonins also displayed differential effects on α-synuclein fibril morphology, suggesting that through mutation of Gly-192, we may induce changes to the intermolecular affinities between GroEL and α-synuclein, leading to more efficient fibril suppression, and in specific cases, modulation of fibril morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2531779067,"Immune responses against gut microbiota should be minimized to avoid unnecessary inflammation at mucosal surface. In this study, we analyzed the expression patterns of Toll-interacting protein (Tollip), an inhibitor of TLRs and IL-1 family cytokine-related intracellular signaling, in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Comparable mRNA expression was observed in murine small and large IECs (S-IECs and L-IECs). However, Tollip protein was only detected in L-IECs, but not in S-IECs. Similar results were obtained in germ-free mice, indicating that L-IEC-specific TOLLIP expression does not depend on bacterial colonization. Next, to understand the mechanisms underlying the post-transcriptional repression of Tollip, 3´-UTR-mediated translational regulation was evaluated. The region +1876/+2398 was responsible for the repression of Tollip expression. This region included the target sequence of miR-31. The inhibition of miR-31 restored the 3´-UTR-meditaed translational repression. In addition, miR-31 expression was significantly higher in S-IECs than in L-IECs, suggesting that miR-31 represses the translation of Tollip mRNA in S-IECs. Collectively, we conclude that the translation of Tollip is inhibited in S-IECs, at least in part, by miR-31 to yield L-IEC-specific high-level expression of the Tollip protein, which may contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2530127516,"The aim was to study associations between work and home environment and prevalence and incidence of respiratory health and a history of atopy in a 3-y cohort of commercial pilots. A questionnaire was mailed in 1997 to all pilots in a Scandinavian airline company (N = 622); 577 (93%) participated. The same questionnaire was sent to the participants 3 years later, 436 participated (76%). There were questions on asthma, respiratory symptoms and infections, allergies, the cabin environment, psychosocial environment and the home environment. Associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The incidence of doctors’ diagnosed asthma and atopy were 2.4 and 16.6 per 1000 person years, respectively. Pilots changing type of flight during follow-up got more airway infections (OR = 11.27; 95% CI 2.39–53.14). Those reporting decreased work control (OR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.03–3.31 for 1 unit change) and those with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home (OR = 3.73; 95% CI 1.09–12.83) had a higher incidence of atopy during follow up. Dampness or mould at home was associated with a higher prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR = 3.55; 95% CI 1.43–8.82) and airway infections (OR = 3.12 95% CI 1.27–7.68). Window pane condensation in winter at home, reported at baseline, was associated with increased incidence of asthma symptoms (OR = 4.14; 95% CI 1.32–12.97) and pilots living in newer buildings at baseline had a higher incidence of airway infections (OR = 5.23; 95% CI 1.43–19.10). In conclusion, lack of work control and ETS at home can be a risk factors for development of allergic symptoms in pilots. Window pane condensation at home can be a risk factor for incidence of asthma symptoms. Dampness and mould at home can be a risk factor for prevalence of asthma symptoms and airway infections and living in newer buildings can be a risk factor for incidence of airway infections."
https://openalex.org/W2530524841,"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has recently started to be adopted into clinical investigations of spinal cord (SC) diseases. However, DTI applications to the lower SC are limited due to a number of technical challenges, related mainly to the even smaller size of the SC structure at this level, its position relative to the receiver coil elements and the effects of motion during data acquisition. Developing methods to overcome these problems would offer new means to gain further insights into microstructural changes of neurological conditions involving the lower SC, and in turn could help explain symptoms such as bladder and sexual dysfunction. In this work, the feasibility of obtaining grey and white matter (GM/WM) DTI indices such as axial/radial/mean diffusivity (AD/RD/MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) within the lumbosacral enlargement (LSE) was investigated using a reduced field-of-view (rFOV) single-shot echo-planar imaging (ss-EPI) acquisition in 14 healthy participants using a clinical 3T MR system. The scan-rescan reproducibility of the measurements was assessed by calculating the percentage coefficient of variation (%COV). Mean FA was higher in WM compared to GM (0.58 and 0.4 in WM and GM respectively), AD and MD were higher in WM compared to GM (1.66 μm2ms-1 and 0.94 μm2ms-1 in WM and 1.2 μm2ms-1 and 0.82 μm2ms-1 in GM for AD and MD respectively) and RD was lower in WM compared to GM (0.58 μm2ms-1 and 0.63 μm2ms-1 respectively). The scan-rescan %COV was lower than 10% in all cases with the highest values observed for FA and the lowest for MD. This pilot study demonstrates that it is possible to obtain reliable tissue-specific estimation of DTI indices within the LSE using a rFOV ss-EPI acquisition. The DTI acquisition and analysis protocol presented here is clinically feasible and may be used in future investigations of neurological conditions implicating the lower SC."

This study aims to assess HIV seroconversion rate of HIV-negative spouse and its associated risk factors among HIV sero-different couples in rural China. Methods An open cohort of HIV sero-different couples enrolled in 30 counties in China between October 1, 2010, and September 30, 2012, and followed-up to December 31, 2012, was constructed retrospectively. A nested case-control study of risk factors of HIV seroconversion among sero-different couples was conducted in April and May of 2013, based on the open cohort. Sero-different couples with the HIV-negative spouse seroconverting at least 3 months after the previous negative diagnosis during cohort observation period were labeled as “case couples”. The “control couples” were selected randomly from the same cohort that did not have the HIV-negative spouse seroconversion during the same period. The “case couples” and “control couples” were matched on gender, age, and region of residence. Sexual behaviors among HIV sero-different couples before and after the index spouses notifying their HIV infection status to their HIV-negative spouses were collected via face-to-face interview. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with HIV seroconversion among HIV sero-different couples. Results Of 4481 HIV sero-different couples, a total of 53 seroconversions were observed within 5218 person-years of follow-up. The incidence rate was 1.02 (95%CI: 0.76–1.33) per 100 person-years. Forty “case couples” confirmed HIV-negative spouse seroconversions infected via marital sexual transmission, were matched to 80 “control couples”. Of the 120 couples, 81(67.5%) were receiving ART, and 70 (58.3%) reported consistently used condoms during intercourse after the index spouse was diagnosed HIV infection. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed that the desire to conceive a child (OR = 5.18, 95% CI: 1.19–22.58) significantly increased the odds of HIV seroconversion. Protective factors of spousal HIV seroconversion were currently receiving ART (OR = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01–0.67) and consistent condom use (OR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.01–0.28). Conclusions Intention to conceive a child is the most important risk factor for HIV seroconversion among sero-different couples. Specific efforts on scientific use of ART to assist sero-different couples to achieve their wish to conceive a healthy child are needed to minimize the risk of HIV transmission."

We determined the first X-ray structures of full-length Tl-gal complexes with carbohydrates (lactose, N-acetyllactosamine, lacto-N-tetraose, sialyllactose, and glucose). Bonds were formed on concave surfaces of both carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) in Tl-gal. All binding sites were found in the HXXXR and WGXEER motifs. Charged Arg61/Arg196 and Glu80/Glu215 on the conserved motif of Tl-gal N-terminal CRD and C-terminal CRD are critical amino acids for recognizing carbohydrate binding, and the residues can affect protein folding and structure. The polar amino acids His, Asn, and Trp are also important residues for the interaction with carbohydrates through hydrogen bonding. Hemagglutination activities of Tl-gal were inhibited by interactions with carbohydrates and mutations. We found that the mutation of Tl-gal (E80A/E215A) at the carbohydrate binding region induced protein aggregation and could be caused in many diseases. The short linker region between the N-terminal and C-terminal CRDs of Tl-gal was very stable against proteolysis and maintained its biological activity. This structural information is expected to elucidate the carbohydrate recognition mechanism of Tl-gal and improve our understanding of anti-inflammatory mediators and modulators of immune response."

Its distribution ranges from eastern Panama to northern Argentina, and it is an important component of the Neotropical ichthyofauna present in the major rivers of South America. We here provide an approximation to the dispersal and historical distributions of Characidium. The biogeographic history of five species of the genus was analyzed through nuclear RAG-2 and mitochondrial 16S genes and a time-calibrated phylogenetic analysis using three outgroup species. A biogeographical reconstruction was performed to estimate ancestral geographic ranges and infer the historical events that impacted the geographic distributions of Characidium species. Our results showed Characidium as a monophyletic group. The molecular clock suggests that the most recent common ancestor of Characidium originated during the Eocene, about 50.2 Mya. In addition, different dispersion and vicariance events could be inferred, which possibly gave rise to the present geographical distribution of the genus. Our results point to the rise of the Andean mountains and sea fluctuations as being important events in the formations and delimitation of different rivers, which influenced the distribution of South American ichthyofauna."

Axial/Mean/Radial diffusivity maps (AD/MD/RD) were generated from DTI data. ADmin/MDmin/RDmin values were quantified within tumor regions-of-interest generated by two independent readers including tumor contrast-to-noise (CNR). Sensitivity/specificity and area-under-the-curve (AUC) were calculated using receiver-operating-characteristic analysis. Inter-reader agreement was assessed (Cohen's kappa).Eighteen patients demonstrated malignant transformation (MT) confirmed in 8/18 by histopathology and in 10/18 through imaging follow-up. Twelve of 18 patients (66.6%) with MT showed diffusion restriction timely coincidental with contrast-enhancement (CE). In the remaining six patients (33.3%), the diffusion restriction preceded the CE. The mean gain in detection time using DTI was (0.8±0.5 years, p = 0.028). Compared to MDmin and RDmin, ROC-analysis showed best diagnostic value for ADmin (sensitivity/specificity 94.94%/89.7%, AUC 0.96; p<0.0001) to detect MT. CNR was highest for AD (1.83±0.14), compared to MD (1.31±0.19; p<0.003) and RD (0.90±0.23; p<0.0001). Cohen's Kappa was 0.77 for ADmin, 0.71 for MDmin and 0.65 for RDmin (p<0.0001, respectively).MT is detectable at the same time point or earlier compared to T1w-CE by diffusion restriction in diffusion-tensor-derived maps. AD demonstrated highest sensitivity/specificity/tumor-contrast compared to radial or mean diffusivity (= apparent diffusion coefficient) to detect MT."
https://openalex.org/W2529982769,"Acute perturbation of the hippocampus, one of the connector hubs in the brain, is a key step in the pathophysiological cascade of transient global amnesia (TGA). We tested the hypothesis that network efficiency, meaning the efficiency of information exchange over a network, is impaired during the acute stage of TGA. Graph theoretical analysis was applied to resting-state EEG data collected from 21 patients with TGA. The EEG data were obtained twice, once during the acute stage (< 24 hours after symptom onset) and once during the resolved stage (> 2 months after symptom onset) of TGA. Characteristic path lengths and clustering coefficients of functional networks constructed using phase-locking values were computed and normalized as a function of the degree in the delta, theta, alpha, beta 1, beta 2 and gamma frequency bands of the EEG. We investigated whether the normalized characteristic path length (nCPL) and normalized clustering coefficients (nCC) differed significantly between the acute and resolved stages of TGA at each frequency band using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For networks where the nCPL or nCC differed significantly between the two stages, we also evaluated changes in the connections of the brain networks. During the acute stage of TGA, the nCPL of the theta band networks with mean degrees of 8, 8.5, 9 and 9.5 significantly increased (P < 0.05). During the acute stage, the lost edges for these networks were mostly found between the anterior (frontal and anterior temporal) and posterior (parieto-occipital and posterior temporal) brain regions, whereas newly developed edges were primarily found between the left and right frontotemporal regions. The nCC of the theta band with a mean degree of 5.5 significantly decreased during the acute stage (P < 0.05). Our results indicate that TGA deteriorates the network efficiency of the theta frequency band. This effect might be related to the desynchronization between the anterior and posterior brain areas."
https://openalex.org/W2530421366,"Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has proved to be an effective method for unsupervised clustering analysis of gene expression data. By the nonnegativity constraint, NMF provides a decomposition of the data matrix into two matrices that have been used for clustering analysis. However, the decomposition is not unique. This allows different clustering results to be obtained, resulting in different interpretations of the decomposition. To alleviate this problem, some existing methods directly enforce uniqueness to some extent by adding regularization terms in the NMF objective function. Alternatively, various normalization methods have been applied to the factor matrices; however, the effects of the choice of normalization have not been carefully investigated. Here we investigate the performance of NMF for the task of cancer class discovery, under a wide range of normalization choices. After extensive evaluations, we observe that the maximum norm showed the best performance, although the maximum norm has not previously been used for NMF.

Among all practical methods for removing phenol substances from polluted water, activated carbon absorption is the most effective way. Here, we have produced low-cost activated carbon using Polygonum orientale Linn, a wide spreading species with large biomass. The phenol adsorption ability of this activated carbon was evaluated at different physico-chemical conditions. Average equilibrium time for adsorption was 120 min. The phenol adsorption ability of the P. orientale activated carbon was increased as the pH increases and reached to the max at pH 9.00. By contrast, the ionic strength had little effect on the phenol absorption. The optimum dose for phenol adsorption by the P. orientale activated carbon was 20.00 g/L. The dominant adsorption mechanism of the P. orientale activated carbon was chemisorption as its phenol adsorption kinetics matched with the pseudo-second-order kinetics. In addition, the equilibrium data were fit to the Langmuir model, with the negative standard free energy and the positive enthalpy, suggesting that adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic."
https://openalex.org/W2529900292,"Elevated hydrostatic pressure was used to probe conformational changes of Aquifex aeolicus dihydroorotase (DHO), which catalyzes the third step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. The isolated protein, a 45-kDa monomer, lacks catalytic activity but becomes active upon formation of a dodecameric complex with aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATC). X-ray crystallographic studies of the isolated DHO and of the complex showed that association induces several major conformational changes in the DHO structure. In the isolated DHO, a flexible loop occludes the active site blocking the access of substrates. The loop is mostly disordered but is tethered to the active site region by several electrostatic and hydrogen bonds. This loop becomes ordered and is displaced from the active site upon formation of DHO-ATC complex. The application of pressure to the complex causes its time-dependent dissociation and the loss of both DHO and ATC activities. Pressure induced irreversible dissociation of the obligate ATC trimer, and as a consequence the DHO is also inactivated. However, moderate hydrostatic pressure applied to the isolated DHO subunit mimics the complex formation and reversibly activates the isolated subunit in the absence of ATC, suggesting that the loop has been displaced from the active site. This effect of pressure is explained by the negative volume change associated with the disruption of ionic interactions and exposure of ionized amino acids to the solvent (electrostriction). The interpretation that the loop is relocated by pressure was validated by site-directed mutagenesis and by inhibition by small peptides that mimic the loop residues.

Pressure induced irreversible dissociation of the obligate ATC trimer, and as a consequence the DHO is also inactivated. However, moderate hydrostatic pressure applied to the isolated DHO subunit mimics the complex formation and reversibly activates the isolated subunit in the absence of ATC, suggesting that the loop has been displaced from the active site. This effect of pressure is explained by the negative volume change associated with the disruption of ionic interactions and exposure of ionized amino acids to the solvent (electrostriction). The interpretation that the loop is relocated by pressure was validated by site-directed mutagenesis and by inhibition by small peptides that mimic the loop residues.

There are three flexible loops, designated A, B, and C that are disordered and invisible in the X-ray structure. The isolated DHO subunit crystallized in two different space groups. These independent structures have nearly identical folds, except a water molecule was bound to the zinc in one X-ray structure (Protein Data Bank code 1xrf), whereas in the other structure (Protein Data Bank code 1xrt), Cys181 in loop A was ligated to the active site zinc, and a section of the loop completely occludes the active site, blocking access of the substrates. We then determined the X-ray structure of the A. aeolicus DHO-ATC complex (17Zhang P. Martin P.D. Purcarea C. Vaishnav A. Brunzelle J.S. Fernando R. Guy-Evans H.I. Evans D.R. Edwards B.F.

The experimental use of pressure can provide valuable and specific information about structure-function relationships in biomacromolecules, particularly proteins. This information relates to the volume changes (ΔV) associated with conformational changes, association-dissociation processes, and the variations of solvation that accompanies these phenomena. This approach is particularly useful in the study of enzyme catalytic and regulatory properties (18Heremans K. High pressure effects on proteins and other biomolecules.Annu. Rev. Biophys.

In the present study, elevated hydrostatic pressure was employed to obtain information about its quaternary structural organization and interactions between the subunits in the A. aeolicus complex. However, during the course of this investigation, it was observed that moderate hydrostatic pressure could reactivate the isolated DHO in the absence of its partner, ATC. The hypothesis that elevated pressure mimics the conformational changes induced by the binding of ATC and displaces the loop occluding the DHO active site was verified by site-directed mutagenesis of residues that tether a segment of the loop in position (17Zhang P. Martin P.D. Purcarea C. Vaishnav A. Brunzelle J.S. Fernando R. Guy-Evans H.I. Evans D.R. Edwards B.F.

The negative ΔV associated with the disruption of these interactions explains the reactivation of the isolated DHO by pressure. This interpretation is currently under further investigation by high pressure crystallography. As reported previously (10Ahuja A. Purcarea C. Ebert R. Sadecki S. Guy H.I. Evans D.R.

Elevated pressure typically, but not always, results in the dissociation of oligomers (19Weber G. Drickamer H. The effect of high pressure upon proteins and other biomolecules.Q. Rev.

To test the effect of pressure on the oligomeric structure and activities of the DHO-ATC complex, it was subjected to 800 bars for 1 h at 25 °C. Samples were taken at 10-min intervals, and both enzymatic activities were measured at atmospheric pressure and 75 °C (Fig. 1A). Both activities decreased with time of exposure to elevated pressure as the DHO-ATC complex dissociated. As first observed for E. coli ATC (22Rosenbusch J.P. Weber K.

Consequently, dissociation of the trimer results in abolition of catalytic activity. Thus, the decrease in activity of ATC accompanying the dissociation of the trimer was anticipated, and because DHO is active only when associated with ATC, its activity might also be expected to decrease in parallel with the inactivation of ATC. However, the DHO activity decreases more slowly than that of ATC, suggesting that there are other factors in play. The same experiment was performed at 400 and 2000 bars (Fig. 1B). The inactivation of both enzymes was slower at 400 bars and more rapid at 2000 bars as compared with the results obtained at the intermediate pressure. Again, DHO was inactivated more slowly at 400 bars, although this difference disappeared at 2000 bars where both activities were rapidly abolished at a comparable rate. No significant decrease of the activities was observed in the control samples kept at atmospheric pressure. After incubation under pressure, no recovery of the catalytic activities was observed after 30 min at atmospheric pressure. To verify that the pressure-induced inactivation of the DHO and ATC subunits is not reversible, the DHO-ATC complex was exposed to a pressure of 1500 bars for 1 h and then returned to atmospheric pressure. As expected, the rate of ATC inactivation was faster than that observed in Fig. 1A, and the difference in the rate of inactivation of ATC and DHO was less pronounced. When returned to atmospheric pressure, the activities remained virtually constant, indicating that the pressure-induced inactivation was irreversible. The interpretation that dissociation of the ATC trimer was responsible for the loss of its catalytic activity was supported by subjecting the DHO-ATC complex to a pressure of 1500 bars in the presence of the ATC substrate, 1 mm carbamoyl phosphate, and 5 mm of the aspartate analog, succinate (Fig. 1C). Previous studies showed that these ligands protect the E. coli catalytic trimer from dissociation and inactivation by pressure. 4G. Hervé and A. Else, manuscript in preparation. Similarly, the inactivation of the A. aeolicus DHO-ATC complex is appreciably slower in the presence of the substrates (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the loss of DHO activity closely paralleled the inactivation of ATC. Again, no recovery was observed at atmospheric pressure. The isolated DHO and ATC subunits were separately subjected to elevated hydrostatic pressure (1500 bars) for 1 h and then brought back to atmospheric pressure for an additional hour. Samples were taken periodically throughout the time course and assayed at 75 °C and atmospheric pressure (Fig. 2). Because DHO activity had only been observed in the DHO-ATC complex, a stoichiometric amount of ATC, which had not been subjected to pressure, was added to the assay after the sample had been removed from the chamber. Because adjacent subunits in the ATC trimer contribute active site residues, its dissociation results in abolition of catalytic activity. Previous studies have shown that elevated hydrostatic pressure dissociates the E. coli ATC catalytic subunit with a concomitant inactivation.4 Similarly, the isolated A. aeolicus ATC subunit was rapidly inactivated at 1500 bars as the trimer dissociates (Fig. 2). There was no recovery of catalytic activity during the 1-h incubation after the sample was returned to atmospheric pressure, confirming that dissociation was irreversible, as observed previously for the E. coli catalytic subunit. In contrast, the monomeric DHO subunit appeared to be quite stable under these conditions; its activity, when subsequently assayed at 1 bar, was reduced by only 10% after 1 h at 1500 bars. This modest loss of activity was not reversed during the 1 h post-pressure incubation at 1 bar. Taken together, these results suggested that the inactivation of the two activities of the complex resulted from the pressure induced dissociation of ATC and that the integrity of the complex relies on the interactions between the ATC monomers in the catalytic trimer, a conclusion consistent with the dodecameric structural organization of the complex (17Zhang P. Martin P.D. Purcarea C. Vaishnav A. Brunzelle J.S. Fernando R. Guy-Evans H.I. Evans D.R. Edwards B.F. Dihydroorotase from the hyperthermophile Aquifex aeolicus is activated by stoichiometric association with aspartate transcarbamoylase and forms a one-pot reactor for pyrimidine biosynthesis.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 766-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In view of the slower pressure-induced decrease of DHO activity as compared with that of ATC, a direct influence of pressure on the activity of the isolated DHO subunit was suspected. In the experiments described thus far, the assays were carried out after the DHO-ATC complex had been subjected to elevated pressure and then returned to atmospheric pressure. In the following experiments, the substrate, dihydroorotate was present in the pressure chamber to assay the reaction under pressure. At atmospheric pressure, there is a very small residual DHO activity in the absence of ATC (Fig. 3) as reported previously (10Ahuja A. Purcarea C. Ebert R. Sadecki S. Guy H.I. Evans D.R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 53136-53144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, at 200 bars, the reaction proceeded at 57% of the rate observed at atmospheric pressure in the presence of the ATC subunit, indicating that there is a pressure induced activation of the DHO subunit. Control experiments verified that dihydroorotate is stable. No trace of carbamoyl aspartate could be detected during a 1-h incubation of dihydroorotate at 200 bars in the absence of the enzyme, whereas at 1 bar, little carbamoyl aspartate was produced by DHO. Dihydroorotate saturation curves of the pressure activated DHO were conducted at increasing hydrostatic pressures (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The substrate was present in the pressure cell, and the reaction at each concentration was allowed to proceed for 10 min. The kcat increases with increasing pressure to a maximum of 12.4 μmol/min/mg corresponding to a kcat of 10.1 s−1, close to the value obtained for the DHO-ATC complex. There was little pressure-dependent difference in the Km values.TABLE 1Kinetic parameter of pressure-activated DHO subunitPressureKmVmaxkcatbarmmμmol/min/mgs−1355.332.081.70704.413.833.131755.74 ± 1.298.20 ± 1.06.703506.65 ± 2.7711.7 ± 2.89.577006.71 ± 1.7212.4 ± 1.810.1 Open table in a new tab To determine whether the reactivation of DHO by pressure is a reversible process, the isolated enzyme was preincubated for 30 min at 200 bars and then returned to atmospheric pressure. Samples were taken at various times and tested for activity at 75 °C in the absence of ATC. No activity could be detected, indicating that the pressure-induced reactivation of DHO is fully reversible and that once returned to atmospheric pressure, DHO reverts to the inactive conformation. The kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by the isolated DHO was measured as a function of pressure over one h incubations to determine the pressure-dependent variation of the rate constant (k). Half-maximal reactivation was observed at about 500 bars. The variation of Ln(k) as a function of pressure (Fig. 5) is linear as expected on theoretical grounds, allowing calculation of the ΔV associated with reactivation. The slope of the plot gave a negative ΔV of −177 ± 4 ml/mol, a value consistent with the exposure to the solvent of a limited number of charged groups. This result suggested that the reactivation of the isolated DHO may result from the dissociation of loop A from the core of the enzyme similar to the displacement that occurs upon binding of the ATC subunit. This interpretation has been further investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and peptide inhibition experiments. Most of loop A is disordered. Only residues 179–187 are visible in the electron density map (Fig. 6). In addition to the interaction between Cys181 in loop A and the active site zinc ion (2.30 Å), two other residues anchor the loop in position (11Martin P.D. Purcarea C. Zhang P. Vaishnav A. Sadecki S. Guy-Evans H.I. Evans D.R. Edwards B.F. The crystal structure of a novel, latent dihydroorotase from Aquifex aeolicus at 1.7A resolution.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Asp179 forms a salt bond with Arg216 (3.15 Å), and Asp183 is hydrogen-bonded to Asn95 (2.78 Å) and forms a salt link with His63 (2.33 Å). Each of these loop A residues was substituted with valine or glycine. The effect of mutation of these residues on the DHO activity was assayed in the isolated DHO subunit as a function of the dihydroorotate concentration (Fig. 7 and Table 2). Each of these mutations significantly decreased the DHOase activity of wild type DHO-ATC. Consequently, the activation of the isolated DHO produced by the mutation was expressed relative that observed for the mutant DHO-ATC complex. The kinetic parameters for the isolated DHO mutant and in the DHO-ATC complex where the mutant DHO subunit is maximally activated are given in Table 2. Replacement of Asp183 with valine activated the isolated subunit 68% compared with the maximum activity observed in the mutant complex. The replacement of Asp179 with valine resulted in a 33% activation, whereas the C181G mutant did not significantly activate the isolated DHO subunit.TABLE 2Activation of loop A mutants by pressureMutantDHO-ATCDHODHO activationaThe activation of the isolated DHO by the mutation was calculated as follows: percentage of activation = [Vmax (isolated DHO)/Vmax (DHO-ATC)] × 100.VmaxbThe assays were conducted at 74 °C, rather than 25 °C, the temperature at which the pressure experiments were conducted, so the Vmax values are appreciably higher.kcatKmVmaxbThe assays were conducted at 74 °C, rather than 25 °C, the temperature at which the pressure experiments were conducted, so the Vmax values are appreciably higher.kcatKmμmol/min/mgs−1mmμmol/min/mgs−1mm%Wild type83.1 ± 5.462.32.38 ± 0.25cActivity too low to obtain reliable values.cActivity too low to obtain reliable values.cActivity too low to obtain reliable values.cActivity too low to obtain reliable values.E179V12.2 ± 0.79.20.24 ± 0.074.00 ± 0.463.06.2 ± 1.032.8C181A20.5 ± 3.215.53.89 ± 1.01cActivity too low to obtain reliable values.cActivity too low to obtain reliable values.cActivity too low to obtain reliable values.0E183V13.2 ± 1.09.70.47 ± 0.168.98 ± 2.046.724.0 ± 6.768.0a The activation of the isolated DHO by the mutation was calculated as follows: percentage of activation = [Vmax (isolated DHO)/Vmax (DHO-ATC)] × 100.b The assays were conducted at 74 °C, rather than 25 °C, the temperature at which the pressure experiments were conducted, so the Vmax values are appreciably higher.c Activity too low to obtain reliable values. Open table in a new tab Thus, the replacement of two of the residues known to dock loop A to the remainder of the protein results in activation of the latent DHO activity of the isolated subunit. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that pressure-induced activation results from a conformational change that moves loop A away from the active site, allowing substrate binding. The failure of the Cys181 mutant to restore catalytic activity suggests that this interaction does not significantly contribute to tethering loop A to the active site. The inhibition of the DHO activity by a series of small peptides that mimic the ordered region of loop A was assessed. If loop A is responsible for the inactivity of the isolated DHO subunit, then these peptides would also be expected to inhibit the active enzyme. The peptides 180HCE182, 179DHCEDD185, and 179DHCEDDKLA187 were incubated at a concentration of 10 μm with the fully active DHO-ATC complex for the indicated times (Fig. 8). 180HCE182, which includes the two residues flanking the cysteine bound to the zinc in the inactive enzyme, had no effect, whereas the other two larger"

For the purpose of ecosystem restoration, in 2007 the guanaco (Lama guanicoe) was reintroduced to the Quebrada del Condorito National Park, situated in the mountains of central Argentina. With the aim of developing management recommendations, the project included permanently monitoring the population to evaluate its dynamics and the ecological response of the individuals released into the area. Nine years later and after two releases of guanacos (113 individuals in 2007 without and 25 in 2011 with a pre-adaptation period), only 24 individuals, which conform three reproductive groups, and one group of solitary males were settled in the Park. Here I modeled a population viability analysis to evaluate extinction risk, using VORTEX software. Initial population structure, specified age distribution, mortality and reproductive rates, and mate monopolization recorded during field work were used in the model, whereas the remaining used demographic parameters, such as age of first offspring, maximum number of broods per year, mean foaling rate, and length of fecundity period, were taken from the literature. Each of the three different scenarios (without supplementation of individuals, and with a realistic and optimistic supplementation) and two possible catastrophic events (fires and food shortage) covering 100 years was repeated 1000 times. Even though the guanaco reintroduction project can be considered to have been partially successful since its start, the model predicts that the current reintroduced population could be extinct in the next few decades if no reinforcements occur, and that only a continuous supplementation can reach the probability that the population survives over the next 100 years. I conclude that, so far, the current population is at a high risk of extinction if further supplementation of individuals is discontinued."

The objectives of this study were to i) investigate the ruminal protection and post-ruminal release of the FA derived from the lipid-encapsulated echium oil (EEO), and ii) assess the bioavailability and metabolism of the EEO-derived FA through measuring the FA content in plasma lipid fractions, feces, and milk. The EEO was tested for rumen stability using the in situ nylon bag technique, then the apparent total-tract digestibility was assessed in vivo using six Holstein dairy cattle. Diets consisted of a control (no EEO); 1.5% of dry matter (DM) as EEO and 1.5% DM as encapsulation matrix; and 3% DM as EEO. The EEO was rumen-stable and had no effect on animal production. EEO-derived FA were incorporated into all plasma lipid fractions, with the highest proportion of n-3 FA observed in cholesterol esters. Fecal excretion of EEO-derived FA ranged from 7–14%. Biohydrogenation products increased in milk, plasma, and feces with EEO supplementation. In conclusion, lipid-encapsulation provides inadequate digestibility to achieve an optimal transfer efficiency of n-3 FA to milk."
https://openalex.org/W2531485021,"We present a model of the early stages of processing in the visual cortex, in particular V1 and MT, to investigate the potential role of end-stopped V1 neurons in solving the aperture problem. A hierarchical network is used in which the incoming motion signals provided by complex V1 neurons and end-stopped V1 neurons proceed to MT neurons at the next stage. MT neurons are categorized into two types based on their function: integration and segmentation. The role of integration neurons is to propagate unambiguous motion signals arriving from those V1 neurons that emphasize object terminators (e.g. corners). Segmentation neurons detect the discontinuities in the input stimulus to control the activity of integration neurons. Although the activity of the complex V1 neurons at the terminators of the object accurately represents the direction of the motion, their level of activity is less than the activity of the neurons along the edges. Therefore, a model incorporating end-stopped neurons is essential to suppress ambiguous motion signals along the edges of the stimulus. It is shown that the unambiguous motion signals at terminators propagate over the rest of the object to achieve an accurate representation of motion."

To solve the problem of low efficiency of inducer for ESCs differentiation into male germ cells, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), Am80(the retinoic acid receptor agonist), and estradiol (E2) was used to induce ESCs to differentiate into male germ cells in vitro. ESCs were cultured in media containing ATRA, Am80, or E2 respectively which can differentiate ESCs into a germ cell lineage. In process of ATRA and Am80 induction Group, germ cell-like cells can be observed in 10 days; but have no in E2 induction Group. The marker genes of germ cell: Dazl, Stra8, C-kit, Cvh, integrinα6, and integrinβ1 all showed a significant up-regulation in the expression level. The ATRA-induction group showed high expression of C-kit and Cvh around 4 days, and integrinα6 and integrinβ1 were activated on day 10, respectively, while the E2-,Am80- induction group showed a high expression of C-kit as early as 4 days immunocytochemistry results shown that, integrinα6 and integrinβ1 could be detected in the ATRA-, Am80-, and E2-induction group, Positive clones in the ATRA group were greater in number than those in the other two groups. we conclued that ATRA, Am80, and E2 can promote the expression of the corresponding genes of germ cells, and had different effect on the differentiation of ESCs into male germ cells. ATRA was the most effective inducer of germ cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2530350034,"Rickettsia slovaca is a tick-borne human pathogen that is associated with scalp eschars and neck lymphadenopathy known as tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA) or Dermacentor-borne necrosis erythema and lymphadenopathy (DEBONEL). Originally, R. slovaca was described in Eastern Europe, but since recognition of its pathogenicity, human cases have been reported throughout Europe. European vertebrate reservoirs of R. slovaca remain unknown, but feral swine and domestic goats have been found infected or seropositive for this pathogen. Recently, a rickettsial pathogen identical to R. slovaca was identified in, and isolated from, the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis. In previous experimental studies, this organism was found infectious to guinea pigs and transovarially transmissible in ticks. In this study, domestic goats (Capra hircus) were experimentally inoculated with the North American isolate of this R. slovaca-like agent to assess their reservoir competence–the ability to acquire the pathogens and maintain transmission between infected and uninfected ticks. Goats were susceptible to infection as demonstrated by detection of the pathogen in skin biopsies and multiple internal tissues, but the only clinical sign of illness was transient fever noted in three out of four goats, and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. On average, less than 5% of uninfected ticks acquired the pathogen while feeding upon infected goats. Although domestic goats are susceptible to the newly described North American isolate of R. slovaca, they are likely to play a minor role in the natural transmission cycle of this pathogen. Our results suggest that goats do not propagate the North American isolate of R. slovaca in peridomestic environments and clinical diagnosis of infection could be difficult due to the brevity and mildness of clinical signs. Further research is needed to elucidate the natural transmission cycle of R. slovaca both in Europe and North America, as well as to identify a more suitable laboratory model."
https://openalex.org/W2531881755,"A series of 14 mesoporous titania materials has been synthesized using the simple alcothermal template-free method and various alcohols, such as methanol, propanols and butanols, as solvents. All materials were characterized by both wide and small angle XRD, which exhibited the anatase phase with short-range ordered mesoporous structure that is still forming during post synthetic temperature treatment in most of the investigated materials. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms confirmed the mesoporous structure with surface area ranging from 241 to 383 m2g- 1 and pore volumes from 0.162 to 0.473 m3g-1, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance showed the redshift of the absorption edge and the bandgap decrease after post synthetic calcination of the materials presented. The TEM, FT-IR, DTA and TG measurements have been made to well characterize the materials synthesized. The mesoporous samples obtained were applied as anode materials for dye-sensitized solar cells and showed good activity in photon-to-current conversion process with efficiency values ranging from 0.54% to 4.6% and fill factors in the 52% to 67% range. The photovoltaic performances were not as high as those obtained for the materials synthesized by us earlier employing ethanol as a solvent. The differences in the electron lifetime, calculated from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results and varying between 4.3 to 17.5 ms, were found as a main factor determining the efficiency of the investigated photovoltaic cells."
