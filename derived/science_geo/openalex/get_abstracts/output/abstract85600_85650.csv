https://openalex.org/W1982020713,"The transforming protein of a primate sarcoma virus and a platelet-derived growth factor are derived from the same or closely related cellular genes. This conclusion is based on the demonstration of extensive sequence similarity between the transforming protein derived from the simian sarcoma virus onc gene, v-sis, and a human platelet-derived growth factor. The mechanism by which v-sis transforms cells could involve the constitutive expression of a protein with functions similar or identical to those of a factor active transiently during normal cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W2080119769,"We constructed numerous deletion mutants in the 3' region of the yeast actin gene intron. When these were introduced into yeast on autonomously replicating shuttle vectors, a sequence element between 35 and 70 nucleotides upstream from the 3' splice site was required for splicing the actin gene transcripts. In mutant genes where this intron region was maintained but new sequences introduced immediately downstream replaced the normal 3' acceptor site sequences, alternative splicing occurred. The alternative splicing signal was generally the first AG dinucleotide following the intron sequence required for splicing. The intron-contained sequence is sufficient to define new intron-exon boundaries. It contains the octanucleotide 5'-TACTAACA-3', which occurs 20 to 55 nucleotides upstream from the 3' splice site in all split protein-coding nuclear genes from S. cerevisiae sequenced to date, and we suggest that it is an essential element of the yeast splicing mechanism, involved in the selection of splicing sites."
https://openalex.org/W2090968423,"We have prepared specific probes for unique-sequence cellular DNA adjacent to each of the newly integrated proviruses in tumors induced by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). The use of such probes to screen a large number of independent mammary tumors in the BR6 strain of mouse has indicated that in at least 17 out of the 40 tumors examined so far, an MMTV provirus has integrated into a common chromosomal domain. A 10 kb Eco RI fragment of single copy DNA from this region has been isolated and partially characterized by restriction enzyme mapping. Of the proviruses located within this fragment in different tumors, all but one are complete, in the same orientation, and clustered within about 3 kb of cellular DNA. These findings are consistent with an insertional mutagenesis model for tumorigenesis by MMTV, in which the integration of a provirus in a particular region of cellular DNA may activate a neighboring oncogene. The region we describe here appears to be different from that reported for mammary tumors in the C3H strain of mouse."

https://openalex.org/W2080045298,"Avian leukosis virus (ALV), a slowly oncogenic retrovirus, induces in chickens a variety of neoplasms, including lymphoid leukosis and erythroblastosis. In lymphoid leukosis, a cellular oncogene, c-myc, is activated by the insertion of ALV LTR. We provide evidence that ALV utilizes a similar mechanism in erythroblastosis induction by activating a different cellular oncogene, c-erbB. We report the isolation, from leukemic erythroblast DNA, of a clone that represents the viral-cell junction fragment and carried the ALV LTR and part of the c-erbB locus. Restriction and sequence analyses reveal that the LTR is located upstream from the erbB coding region and is oriented in the same transcriptional direction; such a structure would be compatible with the promoter-insertion type of activation. Our findings provide a molecular explanation for the multipotency of slowly oncogenic retroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2089039928,"Gamma rays have been used to induce Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants in which the entire locus for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has been eliminated. These mutants were isolated in two steps from a methotrexate-resistant clone (Flintoff, Davidson, and Siminovitch (1976). Somat. Cell Genet. 2, 245-262). The resistant cells contain amplified copies of a mutant dhfr gene that codes for a drug-resistant form of the enzyme. In the first step, methotrexate-sensitive mutants of the amplified line were selected. These mutants exhibit a reduced level of DHFR activity and contain a reduced number of dhfr genes. The remaining DHFR activity is methotrexate-sensitive. These mutants appear to be hemizygotes that have lost all copies of the amplified altered dhfr genes and retain one wild-type allele. In a second mutagenic step, mutants completely deficient in DHFR activity were isolated. Three of four of these mutants were the result of double deletions: they lack all traces of dhfr DNA sequences. The fourth mutant contains a deletion that extends through the 5' half of the dhfr gene. The hemizygotes for dhfr should be useful for the study of mutation at an autosomal mammalian locus without the complications of diploidy."

https://openalex.org/W2030104581,"The tar and tsr genes of E. coli encode functionally analogous transducer proteins that mediate two distinct classes of chemotactic response. The tap gene lies adjacent to tar, and is thought to encode another transducer protein. We present here the complete nucleotide sequence of the tar-tap region of the E. coli genome, together with a comparative analysis of the sequences of the Tar, Tap, and Tsr proteins. The proteins appear to have a simple transmembrane structure consisting of an extracytoplasmic amino-terminal domain, a membrane-spanning domain, and an intracellular carboxy-terminal domain. The carboxy-terminal domains of three proteins possess highly homologous sequences and contain sites of methylation involved in sensory adaptation, while the amino-terminal sequences are only distantly related to one another, consistent with their serving as chemoreceptor domains that have diverged functionally."
https://openalex.org/W2002357551,"Avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) is an oncogenic retrovirus that rapidly causes myeloblastic leukemia in chickens and transforms myeloid cells in culture. AMV carries an oncogene, v-myb, that is derived from a cellular gene, c-myb, found in the genomes of vertebrate species. We constructed a plasmid vector that allows expression of a portion of the coding region for v-myb in a procaryotic host. We then used the myb-encoded protein produced in bacteria to immunize rabbits. The antisera obtained permitted identification of the proteins encoded by both v-myb and chicken c-myb. The molecular weights of the products of v-myb and c-myb (45,000 and 75,000 respectively) indicate that the v-myb protein is an appreciably truncated version of the c-myb protein."
https://openalex.org/W2063224153,"The dilute (d) coat color mutation of DBA/2J mice is closely associated with the site of integration of an ecotropic murine leukemia provirus. In five independent dilute revertants (d+) examined, reversion to wild-type coat-color correlated with the loss of most of the ecotropic proviral genome, indicating that virus integration caused the mutation. Molecular cloning and restriction enzyme analysis of the viral preintegration site as well as two independent dilute revertants, showed that exactly one long terminal repeat (LTR) remained in each revertant DNA, suggesting that virus excision occurred by homologous recombination involving the viral LTRs."

https://openalex.org/W1996010519,"We have investigated transcription termination on a segment of Drosophila DNA that complements a yeast adenine-8 mutation. Poly(A)+ RNA transcribed from this segment in yeast terminates at multiple sites clustered just beyond an AAUAAA sequence implicated in polyadenylation of higher eucaryotic messages. Deletion analysis indicates that, in yeast, this sequence is not required for polyadenylation. Rather, transcription termination is signalled by a region that is upstream of the AAUAAA sequence. At least part of the control region appears to be an 8-base pair (bp) sequence also found in the termination control region of the yeast CYC1 gene. Termination sites for the various deletions show a clear sequence preference. These sites occur in clusters at least 50 bp downstream of the control region, suggesting similarities between termination in yeast and p-dependent termination in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1980596615,"A point mutation alters the 12th amino acid of the c-Ha-ras oncogene product p21 in a human bladder cancer cell line. This is, at present, the only mutation known to result in a human transforming gene. This mutation may therefore represent a possible target for mutagenesis leading to carcinogenesis in humans. By means of restriction enzyme analysis, 29 human cancers, including 20 primary tumor tissues, derived from organs commonly exposed to environmental carcinogens, were tested for the presence of this mutation. None of ten primary bladder carcinomas exhibited the mutation; nor did nine colon carcinomas or ten carcinomas of the lung. Thus the point mutation affecting the 12th amino acid of the c-Ha-ras gene product, while a valuable model for carcinogenesis, does not appear to play a role in the development of most human epithelial cancers of the bladder, colon, or lung."
https://openalex.org/W2051035294,"Lipid peroxidation triggered by ascorbate or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in rat liver microsomes can initiate the epoxidation of 7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene. The stereochemistry of epoxidation is indicative of a peroxide-dependent free radical process. Since the epoxides formed may be the most carcinogenic derivatives of benzo[a]pyrene yet identified, lipid peroxidation can effect the metabolic activation of proximate carcinogens to ultimate carcinogens."

https://openalex.org/W2075854805,"The size of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA) in cells infected with different EBV isolates varies directly with the size of the EBV triplet repeat array, IR3. The isolate with the largest IR3 fragment has approximately 170 more codons than the isolates with the smallest IR3 fragment; it encodes an EBNA which is approximately 17,000 daltons larger than the smallest EBNA. The EBV IR3 encodes part of a 2-kilobase exon of a latently infected cell messenger RNA which must be translated into a repetitive amino acid domain of EBNA."
https://openalex.org/W1981695246,"Primary cell cultures of African Green monkey kidney (AGMK) contain polarized epithelial cells in which influenza virus matures predominantly at the apical surfaces above tight junctions. Influenza virus glycoproteins were found to be localized at the same membrane domain from which the virus budded. When polarized primary AGMK cells were infected with recombinant SV40 viruses containing DNA coding for either an influenza virus H1 or H2 subtype hemagglutinin (HA), the HA proteins were preferentially expressed at the apical surface in a manner identical to that observed in influenza virus-infected cells. Thus, cellular mechanisms for sorting membrane glycoproteins recognize some structural feature of the HA glycoprotein itself, and other viral proteins are not necessary for this process."
https://openalex.org/W1605993021,"[3H]Nitrendipine binds with high affinity to a calcium antagonist receptor in rat brain membranes. At 4 degrees C, treatment with digitonin solubilized the calcium antagonist receptor as a stable complex with [3H]nitrendipine. The nitrendipine concentration that gave a half-maximal amount of the solubilized [3H]nitrendipine-receptor complex was identical to the Kd for specific nitrendipine binding to brain membranes. Nitrendipine dissociated from digitonin-solubilized and membrane-bound receptors with a half-time of 24 to 30 min at 20 degrees C. Verapamil increased and diltiazem decreased the dissociation rate to a similar extent in both preparations indicating that the solubilized receptor contains both the dihydropyridine and diltiazem/verapamil binding sites. Sucrose gradient sedimentation experiments gave a value of S20, omega = 19.2 for the receptor-digitonin complex. The solubilized calcium antagonist receptor binds specifically to wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose columns consistent with an identification as a glycoprotein."

These genes were introduced into cultured monkey cells, and their transcripts were analyzed. Transcripts of these duplication variants were spliced only at the proximal copy of the duplicated splice sites. These data are consistent with a 5′→3′ model of splice site selection."
https://openalex.org/W2080670907,"We have previously isolated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants that do not express low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. When one mutant clone was cocultivated with other receptor-defective clones, it was induced to express receptors that could mediate normal endocytosis. These LDL receptor-defective clones defined two classes of mutations: cbc (complemented by cocultivation) and icc (inducer cells in cocultivation). The induction and short-term (18 hr) stability of LDL receptors in cbc cells did not require protein synthesis by icc cells. Receptor activity could not be induced by DMSO, 5-azacytidine, phosphatidylcholine liposomes, dibutyryl cAMP, compactin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, low temperature (30 degrees C), or conditioned medium, but could be induced by cocultivation with parental CHO cells and normal and LDL receptor-negative human fibroblasts. Complementation by cocultivation only occurred when the cbc and inducing cells were in close proximity, suggesting that an unstable diffusible factor or intimate cell-to-cell association was required for complementation."
https://openalex.org/W2121609364,"We have constructed four novel adenovirus-SV40 hybrid viruses that contain the SV40 A gene at different positions downstream from the adenoviral major late promoter, within the region that encodes the second and third segments of the late tripartite RNA leader. The SV40 insert was precisely positioned in preselected regions of the adenoviral genome by using a combination of in vitro and in vivo recombination. As expected, all four recombinants produce equally high levels of SV40-encoded RNA that initiates at the adenovirus late promoter and contains two or three leader segments at the 5' end. Yet, in spite of this efficient transcription, only one virus, Ad-SVR284, directs the synthesis of high levels of SV40 large T antigen in infected cells; the other recombinants all produce approximately 20-fold less T antigen. This differential expression is, however, not seen in vitro, where equal amounts of hybrid T mRNA direct the synthesis of equal amounts of SV40 T antigen. Thus, some form of translational regulation is present in adenovirus-infected cells that is missing from the in vitro translation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2054715194,"Transmission of Chagas' disease by transfusion of blood containing Trypanosoma cruzi has often been reported, and gentian violet, a triarylmethane dye, is widely used by blood banks in attempts to eliminate such transmission. In a study of intact trypanosomes, gentian violet was found to undergo a one-electron reduction to produce a carbon-centered free radical as demonstrated by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Either reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or the reduced dinucleotide phosphate could serve as a source of reducing equivalents for the production of this free radical by homogenates of Trypanosoma cruzi. The formation of this free radical, and the trypanocidal action of gentian violet, were enhanced by light. The enhanced free radical formation may be the basic cause of the selective toxicity of gentian violet to Trypanosoma cruzi."

https://openalex.org/W2141668713,"The DNA sequences which encode the Mr = 28,500 flagellin polypeptide of Caulobacter crescentus CB15 have been determined. The size of the protein, deduced from its DNA sequence (276 amino acids), is in agreement with its apparent molecular weight as measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The distribution of arginine residues within the protein sequence encoded by the gene correlates with their relative location as predicted by peptide alignment analysis (Gill, P.R., and Agabian, N. (1982) J. Bacteriol. 150, 925-933). DNA sequences 5' and 3' to the coding sequence were also determined. In the 5' region, DNA sequences homologous to consensus sequences associated with RNA polymerase recognition and transcription initiation sites in Escherichia coli (Pribnow box) are found. These are centered around 60, 90, and 120 base pairs upstream from the ATG codon at the beginning of the structural gene. Sequences 3' to the coding region were identified which might signal transcription termination. A typical E. coli 16 S ribosomal binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence) is located just 5' to the coding sequence, and for most of the amino acids there is a strong codon usage preference. Although this protein is exported from the cell (Gill, P.R., and Agabian, N. (1982) J. Bacteriol. 150, 925-933), the encoded NH2-terminal amino acid sequence is not different from the mature product."
https://openalex.org/W1552666003,"The production of alpha-melanotropin (alpha-N-acetyl-ACTH(1-13)NH2 (alpha MSH) in rat intermediate pituitary was investigated using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, immunoassays, and biosynthetic labeling. Extracts of rat intermediate pituitary contain primarily alpha-N,O-diacetyl-ACTH(1-13)NH2, with smaller amounts of des- and monoacetyl-ACTH(1-13)NH2. No significant amount of ACTH(1-14)OH- or ACTH(1-13)OH-related material was observed. Analysis of the newly synthesized alpha MSH-sized peptides produced by freshly prepared rat intermediate pituitary cell suspensions revealed labeled peptides co-migrating primarily with des-, mono-, and diacetyl-ACTH(1-13)NH2. In contrast, when extracts of 2-week-old intermediate pituitary cultures were analyzed, the major peak of material detected with the general NH2-terminal ACTH antiserum eluted at the position expected for alpha-N,O-diacetyl-ACTH(1-14)OH; smaller amounts of material co-migrating with des- and monoacetyl-ACTH(1-14)OH were also detected. Analysis of the newly synthesized alpha MSH-sized peptides produced by 16-day-old cultures of intermediate pituitary cells revealed labeled peptides co-migrating with des-, mono-, and diacetyl-ACTH(1-14)OH. Thus, rat intermediate pituitary cells in culture maintain the ability to perform several major proteolytic cleavages of pro-ACTH/endorphin as well as the ability to alpha-N-acetylate alpha MSH and beta-endorphin, but selectively lose the ability to alpha-amidate the carboxyl terminus of alpha MSH."

The resulting lymphoblastoid cell line has secreted immunoglobulin G1 of the kappa type continuously for 2 years. This immunoglobulin, detected both on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm, reacts with cells infected with herpes simplex virus.

https://openalex.org/W1554160439,"The binding of beta-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate to rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase and rabbit liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was studied using the column centrifugation procedure (Penefsky, H. S., (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 2891-2899). Phosphofructokinase binds 1 mol of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate/mol of protomer (Mr = 80,000). The Scatchard plots of the binding of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate to phosphofructokinase are nonlinear in the presence of three different buffer systems and appear to exhibit negative cooperativity. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and glucose 1,6-bisphosphate inhibit the binding of fructose-2,6-P2 with Ki values of 15 and 280 microM, respectively. Sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate, ATP, and high concentrations of phosphate also inhibit the binding. Other metabolites including fructose-6-P, AMP, and citrate show little effect. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase binds 1 mol of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate/mol of subunit (Mr = 35,000) with an affinity constant of 1.5 X 10(6) M-1. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, fructose-6-P, and phosphate are competitive inhibitors with Ki values of 4, 2.7, and 230 microM, respectively. Sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate (1 mM) inhibits approximately 50% of the binding of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose bisphosphatase, but AMP has no effect. Mn2+, Co2+, and a high concentration of Mg2+ inhibit the binding. Thus, we may conclude that fructose 2,6-bisphosphate binds to phosphofructokinase at the same allosteric site for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate while it binds to the catalytic site of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1989452946,"The discovery that the 72 capsomeres of the icosahedrally symmetric polyoma virus capsid are all pentamers1 shows that the expected quasi-equivalent bonding specificity2 is not conserved in the assembly of this virus coat protein. Tubular particles produced by polyoma and other papovaviruses seem to be polymorphic aggregates of capsomeres3 that may arise through variation in switching of the bonding specificity. Electron micrographs of wide and narrow classes of tubes were analysed by Kiselev and Klug4 using optical diffraction and optical filtering methods. The wide type were called ‘hexamer’ tubes because they consist of approximately hexagonally arrayed capsomeres that were assumed to be hexamers4, in accord with the quasi-equivalence theory of icosahedral virus particle construction2. The narrow type were called ‘pentamer’ tubes because the capsomeres are arrayed in a particular ‘pentagonal tessellation’ which arises from the pairing of pentamers across 2-fold axes of the surface lattice4. Our reexamination of negatively-stained polyoma virus tubes by digital image processing of low-irradiation electron micrographs shows that all tubes are assemblies of paired pentameric capsomeres. We report here that the packing arrangement of the pentamers in the hexamer tubes is simply related to the pentagonal tessellation4 representing the packing in the narrow pentamer tubes. In all the tube structures examined, at least one pairwise contact between neighbouring pentamers closely resembles the contact between the pentavalent and hexavalent capsomeres in the icosahedral capsid1."

https://openalex.org/W1588032844,High and low affinity binding sites for tetrodotoxin have been found in rat skeletal muscle cells in vitro using a radiolabeled tetrodotoxin derivative and 22Na+ flux studies. High affinity binding sites for tetrodotoxin (KD(tetrodotoxin) = 1.6 nM) cannot be detected at the myoblast stage. They appear and increase in density as myoblasts fuse into myotubes to reach a maximum binding capacity of 50 fmol/mg of proteins. Na+ channel structures with a high affinity for tetrodotoxin cannot be activated by neurotoxins specific for the Na+ channel such as veratridine and sea anemone toxinII. They are not expressed in the action potential. Na+ channels with a low affinity for tetrodotoxin (IC50(tetrodotoxin) = 1 microM) are functional since they can be activated by veratridine and sea anemone toxinII. They are already expressed in myoblasts and their density is not modified during the fusion of myoblasts into myotubes; they remain functional throughout the differentiation process. It is suggested that neuronal factors are not required for the synthesis of structures with high affinity binding sites for tetrodotoxin in the rat muscle and that they are only involved for the maturation of these structures from a nonfunctional to a functional form.
https://openalex.org/W1539674192,"The mechanism of benzene oxygenation in liver microsomes and in reconstituted enzyme systems from rabbit liver was investigated. It was found that the NADPH-dependent transformation of benzene to water-soluble metabolites and to phenol catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 LM2 in membrane vesicles was inhibited by catalase, horseradish peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and hydroxyl radical scavengers such as mannitol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and catechol, indicating the participation of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anions, and hydroxyl radicals in the process. The cytochrome P-450 LM2-dependent, hydroxyl radical-mediated destruction of deoxyribose was inhibited concomitantly to the benzene oxidation. Also the microsomal benzene metabolism, which did not exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetics, was effectively inhibited by six different hydroxyl radical scavengers. Biphenyl was formed in the reconstituted system, indicating the cytochrome P-450-dependent production of a hydroxycyclohexadienyl radical as a consequence of interactions between hydroxyl radicals and benzene. The formation of benzene metabolites covalently bound to protein was efficiently inhibited by radical scavengers but not by epoxide hydrolase. The results indicate that the microsomal cytochrome P-450-dependent oxidation of benzene is mediated by hydroxyl radicals formed in a modified Haber-Weiss reaction between hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anions and suggest that any cellular superoxide-generating system may be sufficient for the metabolic activation of benzene and structurally related compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1565948699,"The techniques of EPR and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) were used to probe structure and electronic distribution at the nitric oxide (NO)-ligated heme alpha 3 in the nitrosylferrocytochrome alpha 3 moiety of fully reduced cytochrome c oxidase. Hyperfine and quadrupole couplings to NO (in both 15NO and 14NO forms), to histidine nitrogens, and to protons near the heme site were obtained. Parallel studies were also performed on NO-ligated myoglobin and model NO-heme-imidazole systems. The major findings and interpretations on nitrosylferrocytochrome alpha 3 were: 1) compared to other NO-heme-imidazole systems, the nitrosylferrocytochrome alpha3 gave better resolution of EPR and ENDOR signals; 2) at the maximal g value (gx = 2.09), particularly well resolved NO nitrogen hyperfine and quadrupole couplings and mesoproton hyperfine couplings were seen. These hyperfine and quadrupole couplings gave information on the electronic distribution on the NO, on the orientation of the g tensor with respect to the heme, and possibly on the orientation of the FeNO plane; 3) a combination of experimental EPR-ENDOR results and EPR spectral simulations evidenced a rotation of the NO hyperfine tensor with respect to the electronic g tensor; this implied a bent Fe-NO bond; 4) ENDOR showed a unique proton not seen in the other NO heme systems studied. The magnitude of this proton's hyperfine coupling was consistent with this proton being part of a nearby protein side chain that perturbs an axial ligand like NO or O2."
https://openalex.org/W1982092674,"Cells infected or transformed by adenovirus-2 express complexes of the viral E19 protein and class I transplantation antigens. To eliminate the complication of the numerous metabolic changes in adenovirus-infected and -transformed cells, we detached the E19 gene from its viral background by constructing transient expression vectors where the E19 coding sequence is flanked by the SV40 early promoter and the 3' region of the rabbit beta-globulin gene. E19 production was assayed 2 days after transfection of monkey COS or human HeLa cells with vector DNA. Efficient E19 gene expression depends on the presence of an intron (the second beta-globin intron), and the E19 protein is properly processed and anchored in the plasma membrane of transfected cells. The vector-synthesized E19 protein is also associated with class I transplantation antigens in human cells, since a fraction of it is coprecipitated both with antiserum against HLA antigens and with monoclonal antibodies against beta 2-microglobulin."

https://openalex.org/W1587823958,"The gene for Escherichia coli guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase was placed after the high efficiency lambda phage leftward promoter in plasmid pHEGPT also containing the lambda CI857 temperature-sensitive repressor. Guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase increases 780-fold when cells containing pHEGPT are shifted from 30 to 42 degrees C. Guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase represents approximately 5% of the protein in a crude extract of induced cells. Guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase may be purified to apparent homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sephadex G-100, and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The enzyme has a subunit molecular weight of 18,600 determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and behaves as a trimer during Sephadex G-100 column chromatography. Guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase is active from pH 7.5 to 10.5 with maximum activity at pH 9.5. The enzyme is protected from heat inactivation by phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP). At 65 degrees C, the enzyme has a half-life of 2 min in the absence of PRPP and 90 min in the presence of PRPP. The enzyme displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics with apparent Michaelis constants for guanine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, and PRPP of 2.6, 39, 167, and 95 microM, respectively. The activity of the enzyme with guanine is 2-fold greater than that with xanthine and 3-fold greater than that with hypoxanthine."
https://openalex.org/W1549652159,"The structures of the altered alpha-melanotropin (alpha MSH or alpha-N-acetyl-ACTH(1-13)NH2)-related molecules produced by cultured rat intermediate pituitary cells were investigated. Peptide analyses demonstrated that the alpha MSH-related molecules produced by acutely prepared intermediate pituitary cells were primarily des-, mono-, and diacetylated ACTH(1-13)NH2; in contrast, longer term cultures produced primarily des-, mono-, and diacetylated ACTH(1-14)OH. No significant amount of labeled ACTH(1-13)OH-related material was observed under any incubation conditions. Intermediate pituitary cells in culture stopped producing alpha-amidated alpha MSH-related molecules with a half-time of approximately 15 to 18 h; instead, ACTH(1-14)OH-related molecules were synthesized. In several pulse-chase experiments, performed under conditions where cultured intermediate pituitary cells were capable of synthesizing alpha MSH-related molecules terminating in -Val13-NH2, labeled molecules ending in -Val13-Gly14-OH were not found to give rise to major amounts of labeled molecules ending in -Val13-NH2. This failure to observe conversion of glycine-extended molecules into alpha-amidated products was not due to selective secretion from the cells, since the acetylation and amidation states of labeled molecules that were secreted under basal conditions reflected those of the molecules stored in the cells, and the basal rate of secretion was very low."
https://openalex.org/W1593161277,"The 5 S DNAs and several tDNAs of Xenopus laevis reside primarily in large clusters of tandem repeating units. We have discovered that a substantial number of these genes, along with portions of their adjacent spacer sequences, are also located in genomic locations apart from the major clusters. This was accomplished by null-digesting total genomic DNA with restriction enzymes that do not cut within the X. laevis tDNA or 5 S DNA major repeats. The tDNA and 5 S DNA main clusters therefore remain intact and can be easily separated on gels from the tDNAs and 5 S DNAs present as low molecular weight restriction fragments. Probing these smaller fragments with different portions of the major repeats has revealed that many of the genes are organized differently from the corresponding tDNAs and 5 S DNAs of the primary clusters. Some of the fragments containing genes are actually present in multiple copies. In addition, many tDNA null-digestion fragments contain more than one type of tRNA coding region. One set of dispersed tDNAs actually comprises a tandemly arranged minor tDNA family which has retained the same repeat length (3.18 kb) as the major tDNA family, but has a substantially different organization. There is significant population polymorphism in the organization of the tDNAs and 5 S DNAs. Dispersed genes that appear to be derived from clusters of tandem repeats (orphons) have been described for several gene families in invertebrates. The occurrence of this phenomenon in vertebrates as well, suggests that such genes may be a general feature of all eukaryotic genomes."

Uptake and binding were enhanced by treatment of the enzyme with alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphodiesterase, greatly reduced by prior treatment with alkaline phosphatase, and restored by subsequent treatment with alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphodiesterase. Immobilized phosphomannosyl receptor was used to separate and low enzyme forms. About 25% of the total beta-glucuronidase was retained by the receptor column and eluted with mannose 6-phosphate. The rate of of retained enzyme was 2.5-3.0-fold greater than that of the enzyme applied to the receptor column. The fraction retained by the column was reduced to 5-10% by prior treatment of the enzyme with alkaline phosphatase. This phosphatase-resistant, receptor-retained fraction was taken up at only 24% the rate of non-phosphatase-treated, receptor-retained enzyme. However, its was increased 7-fold by treatment with alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphodiesterase. The enhanced rate of pinocytosis conferred by treatment of the enzyme with alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphodiesterase was destroyed by a subsequent treatment with alkaline phosphatase. These studies demonstrate that although most of the high uptake enzyme in beta-glucuronidase from human spleen binds to receptors through phosphomonoesters of mannose, a significant fraction can interact with immobilized phosphomannosyl receptor and be taken up by fibroblasts through interactions involving mannose 6-phosphate in diester linkage with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine."
https://openalex.org/W1503521064,"Previous in vivo studies have demonstrated that gonadotropic desensitization of luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) receptors and steroid responses is preceded by an early phase of receptor up-regulation. Hormonal desensitization has been recently reproduced in an in vitro Leydig cell culture, which has now been applied to studies on the early up-regulation of receptors. We performed comparative studies on the binding of 125I-hCG in isolated Leydig cells in plated culture and in suspension. In plated cells the total binding was up to 200% higher than that measured in suspension. This difference was not due to differential internalization. Preincubation with hCG in plated culture for 2 to 6 h increased the number of binding sites measured in suspension. The kinetics of the binding of labeled hCG to plated cells showed a secondary increase which reached its maximum after 3 h of incubation. This increase in hCG binding was not prevented by preincubation with inhibitors of protein synthesis and steroidogenesis or of microtubule or microfilament function. The sensitivities of the testosterone and cAMP responses to hCG in the plated cells were lower than those observed in suspension. These differences were maintained in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. These results demonstrated that the cell interaction with a solid substratum is required for the acute up-regulation of the luteinizing hormone receptor and can induce changes in the Leydig cell responsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2096635468,"Mu DNA replication has been carried out in vitro on cellophane discs in the presence of dBUTP. If the DNA is sheared to 80 kb pieces, the Mu replicas band anomalously in CsCl gradients between hybrid and light DNA density positions. The intermediate density DNA comprises semiconservatively replicated Mu sequences, flanked by unreplicated light DNA. This and previous data are consistent with replication occurring within Mu boundaries. Both the synthesis of Mu sequences and the intermediate density DNA are abolished by protein synthesis inhibition in vivo just prior to lysis on cellophane discs. These observations indicate that at least some steps in bona fide Mu transposition-replication are being observed in vitro."
