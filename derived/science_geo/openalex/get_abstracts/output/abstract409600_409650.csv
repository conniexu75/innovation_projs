https://openalex.org/W2041237929,"Intra-abdominal tumors, such as ovarian cancer, have a clear predilection for metastasis to the omentum, an organ primarily composed of adipocytes. Currently, it is unclear why tumor cells preferentially home to and proliferate in the omentum, yet omental metastases typically represent the largest tumor in the abdominal cavities of women with ovarian cancer. We show here that primary human omental adipocytes promote homing, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, and that adipokines including interleukin-8 (IL-8) mediate these activities. Adipocyte-ovarian cancer cell coculture led to the direct transfer of lipids from adipocytes to ovarian cancer cells and promoted in vitro and in vivo tumor growth. Furthermore, coculture induced lipolysis in adipocytes and β-oxidation in cancer cells, suggesting adipocytes act as an energy source for the cancer cells. A protein array identified upregulation of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4, also known as aP2) in omental metastases as compared to primary ovarian tumors, and FABP4 expression was detected in ovarian cancer cells at the adipocyte-tumor cell interface. FABP4 deficiency substantially impaired metastatic tumor growth in mice, indicating that FABP4 has a key role in ovarian cancer metastasis. These data indicate adipocytes provide fatty acids for rapid tumor growth, identifying lipid metabolism and transport as new targets for the treatment of cancers where adipocytes are a major component of the microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W1990689143,"DNA methylation dynamics influence brain function and are altered in neurological disorders. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), a DNA base that is derived from 5-methylcytosine, accounts for ∼40% of modified cytosine in the brain and has been implicated in DNA methylation-related plasticity. We mapped 5-hmC genome-wide in mouse hippocampus and cerebellum at three different ages, which allowed us to assess its stability and dynamic regulation during postnatal neurodevelopment through adulthood. We found developmentally programmed acquisition of 5-hmC in neuronal cells. Epigenomic localization of 5-hmC-regulated regions revealed stable and dynamically modified loci during neurodevelopment and aging. By profiling 5-hmC in human cerebellum, we found conserved genomic features of 5-hmC. Finally, we found that 5-hmC levels were inversely correlated with methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 dosage, a protein encoded by a gene in which mutations cause Rett syndrome. These data suggest that 5-hmC-mediated epigenetic modification is critical in neurodevelopment and diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2134285290,"Exercise, obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with elevated plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that induces insulin secretion. Here we show that administration of IL-6 or elevated IL-6 concentrations in response to exercise stimulate GLP-1 secretion from intestinal L cells and pancreatic alpha cells, improving insulin secretion and glycemia. IL-6 increased GLP-1 production from alpha cells through increased proglucagon (which is encoded by GCG) and prohormone convertase 1/3 expression. In models of type 2 diabetes, the beneficial effects of IL-6 were maintained, and IL-6 neutralization resulted in further elevation of glycemia and reduced pancreatic GLP-1. Hence, IL-6 mediates crosstalk between insulin-sensitive tissues, intestinal L cells and pancreatic islets to adapt to changes in insulin demand. This previously unidentified endocrine loop implicates IL-6 in the regulation of insulin secretion and suggests that drugs modulating this loop may be useful in type 2 diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2058978266,"Damage to prefrontal cortex (PFC) impairs decision-making, but the underlying value computations that might cause such impairments remain unclear. Here we report that value computations are doubly dissociable among PFC neurons. Although many PFC neurons encoded chosen value, they used opponent encoding schemes such that averaging the neuronal population extinguished value coding. However, a special population of neurons in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but not in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), multiplexed chosen value across decision parameters using a unified encoding scheme and encoded reward prediction errors. In contrast, neurons in OFC, but not ACC, encoded chosen value relative to the recent history of choice values. Together, these results suggest complementary valuation processes across PFC areas: OFC neurons dynamically evaluate current choices relative to recent choice values, whereas ACC neurons encode choice predictions and prediction errors using a common valuation currency reflecting the integration of multiple decision parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2079712106,"Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer shows a higher incidence in women of African ancestry compared to women of European ancestry. In search of common risk alleles for ER-negative breast cancer, we combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from women of African ancestry (1,004 ER-negative cases and 2,745 controls) and European ancestry (1,718 ER-negative cases and 3,670 controls), with replication testing conducted in an additional 2,292 ER-negative cases and 16,901 controls of European ancestry. We identified a common risk variant for ER-negative breast cancer at the TERT-CLPTM1L locus on chromosome 5p15 (rs10069690: per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.18 per allele, P = 1.0 × 10(-10)). The variant was also significantly associated with triple-negative (ER-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative and human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2)-negative) breast cancer (OR = 1.25, P = 1.1 × 10(-9)), particularly in younger women (<50 years of age) (OR = 1.48, P = 1.9 × 10(-9)). Our results identify a genetic locus associated with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer subtypes in multiple populations."

https://openalex.org/W2029353665,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder affecting ∼1% of the world population, with heritability of up to 80%. To identify new common genetic risk factors, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Han Chinese population. The discovery sample set consisted of 3,750 individuals with schizophrenia and 6,468 healthy controls (1,578 cases and 1,592 controls from northern Han Chinese, 1,238 cases and 2,856 controls from central Han Chinese, and 934 cases and 2,020 controls from the southern Han Chinese). We further analyzed the strongest association signals in an additional independent cohort of 4,383 cases and 4,539 controls from the Han Chinese population. Meta-analysis identified common SNPs that associated with schizophrenia with genome-wide significance on 8p12 (rs16887244, P = 1.27 × 10(-10)) and 1q24.2 (rs10489202, P = 9.50 × 10(-9)). Our findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2161046428,"The orbitofrontal cortex has been hypothesized to carry information regarding the value of expected rewards. Such information is essential for associative learning, which relies on comparisons between expected and obtained reward for generating instructive error signals. These error signals are thought to be conveyed by dopamine neurons. To test whether orbitofrontal cortex contributes to these error signals, we recorded from dopamine neurons in orbitofrontal-lesioned rats performing a reward learning task. Lesions caused marked changes in dopaminergic error signaling. However, the effect of lesions was not consistent with a simple loss of information regarding expected value. Instead, without orbitofrontal input, dopaminergic error signals failed to reflect internal information about the impending response that distinguished externally similar states leading to differently valued future rewards. These results are consistent with current conceptualizations of orbitofrontal cortex as supporting model-based behavior and suggest an unexpected role for this information in dopaminergic error signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2097753381,"Conformation-specific antibodies and longitudinal tracking of individual neurons in situ identifies a toxic monomer species linked to Huntington's disease. Polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches exceeding a threshold length confer a toxic function to proteins that contain them and cause at least nine neurological disorders. The basis for this toxicity threshold is unclear. Although polyQ expansions render proteins prone to aggregate into inclusion bodies, this may be a neuronal coping response to more toxic forms of polyQ. The exact structure of these more toxic forms is unknown. Here we show that the monoclonal antibody 3B5H10 recognizes a species of polyQ protein in situ that strongly predicts neuronal death. The epitope selectively appears among some of the many low-molecular-weight conformational states assumed by expanded polyQ and disappears in higher-molecular-weight aggregated forms, such as inclusion bodies. These results suggest that protein monomers and possibly small oligomers containing expanded polyQ stretches can adopt a conformation that is recognized by 3B5H10 and is toxic or closely related to a toxic species."
https://openalex.org/W2148306017,"Coiled-coil assemblies have served as a rich resource for testing fundamental principles of protein structure and function. A semi-empirical design strategy now yields the first parallel hexamer, which also displays an internal channel that can be manipulated to direct assembly. The design of new proteins that expand the repertoire of natural protein structures represents a formidable challenge. Success in this area would increase understanding of protein structure and present new scaffolds that could be exploited in biotechnology and synthetic biology. Here we describe the design, characterization and X-ray crystal structure of a new coiled-coil protein. The de novo sequence forms a stand-alone, parallel, six-helix bundle with a channel running through it. Although lined exclusively by hydrophobic leucine and isoleucine side chains, the 6-Å channel is permeable to water. One layer of leucine residues within the channel is mutable, accepting polar aspartic acid and histidine side chains, which leads to subdivision and organization of solvent within the lumen. Moreover, these mutants can be combined to form a stable and unique (Asp-His)3 heterohexamer. These new structures provide a basis for engineering de novo proteins with new functions."
https://openalex.org/W2102785745,"Disgust has been described as the most primitive and central of emotions. Thus, it is not surprising that it shapes behaviors in a variety of organisms and in a variety of contexts—including homo sapien politics. People who believe they would be bothered by a range of hypothetical disgusting situations display an increased likelihood of displaying right-of-center rather than left-of-center political orientations. Given its primal nature and essential value in avoiding pathogens disgust likely has an effect even without registering in conscious beliefs. In this article, we demonstrate that individuals with marked involuntary physiological responses to disgusting images, such as of a man eating a large mouthful of writhing worms, are more likely to self-identify as conservative and, especially, to oppose gay marriage than are individuals with more muted physiological responses to the same images. This relationship holds even when controlling for the degree to which respondents believe themselves to be disgust sensitive and suggests that people's physiological predispositions help to shape their political orientations."
https://openalex.org/W2038531680,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα, -β/δ, and -γ) are a subfamily of nuclear receptors that plays key roles in glucose and lipid metabolism. PPARγ is the molecular target of the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs that has many side effects. PPARγ is also activated by long chain unsaturated or oxidized/nitrated fatty acids, but its relationship with the medium chain fatty acids remains unclear even though the medium chain triglyceride oils have been used to control weight gain and glycemic index. Here, we show that decanoic acid (DA), a 10-carbon fatty acid and a major component of medium chain triglyceride oils, is a direct ligand of PPARγ. DA binds and partially activates PPARγ without leading to adipogenesis. Crystal structure reveals that DA occupies a novel binding site and only partially stabilizes the AF-2 helix. DA also binds weakly to PPARα and PPARβ/δ. Treatments with DA and its triglyceride form improve glucose sensitivity and lipid profiles without weight gain in diabetic mice. Together, these results suggest that DA is a modulating ligand for PPARs, and the structure can aid in designing better and safer PPARγ-based drugs.

https://openalex.org/W1979560455,"Adiponectin is the most abundant adipokine secreted from adipocytes. Accumulating evidence suggests that the physiological roles of adiponectin go beyond its metabolic effects. In the present study, we demonstrate that adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) are expressed in adult hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSCs). Adiponectin treatment increases proliferation of cultured adult hNSCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas apoptosis and differentiation of adult hNSCs into neuronal or glial lineage were not affected. Adiponectin activates AMP-activated protein kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) signaling pathways in adult hNSCs. Pretreatment with the p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580, but not the AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitor Compound C, attenuates adiponectin-induced cell proliferation. Moreover, adiponectin induces phosphorylation of Ser-389, a key inhibitory site of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), and this effect can be blocked by inhibition of p38MAPK with SB203580. Levels of total and nuclear β-catenin, the primary substrate of GSK-3β, were increased by adiponectin treatment. These results indicate that adiponectin stimulates proliferation of adult hNSCs, via acting on GSK-3β to promote nuclear accumulation of β-catenin.

Further, RECQL4 localizes to telomeres and associates with shelterin proteins TRF1 and TRF2. Using recombinant proteins we showed that RECQL4 resolves telomeric D-loop structures with the help of shelterin proteins TRF1, TRF2, and POT1.

Telomeres are structures at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes that prevent DNA end-initiated recombination, exonucleolytic DNA degradation, and replication-associated terminal recession. In the absence of an active mechanism to maintain telomere length, the telomere repeat number decreases with each replicative cell cycle. Telomere attrition is associated with genome instability, cell cycle arrest, and senescence or apoptosis. Telomeric DNA is composed of double-stranded tandem repeat sequences (5′-TTAGGG-3′ in human and mouse) followed by a short ssDNA 2The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNARTSRothmund-Thomson syndromeKDknockdownSCRscrambledco-IPco-immunoprecipitationTIFtelomere dysfunction-induced fociT-SCEtelomere sister chromatid exchangeDL1telomeric D-loopDL48-oxoguanine-containing D-loopDLmxnon-telomeric D-loop. 3′-overhang (1Smogorzewska A. de Lange T.

In mammals, telomeric DNA is believed to exist as a D-loop, formed by invasion of the 3′-overhang into telomeric dsDNA (2Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A.

The DNA replication machinery is unable to replicate DNA ends, and as cells proliferate telomeric DNA can be lost. This terminal DNA loss is compensated for by telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that adds TTAGGG repeats at the 3′-ends of chromosomal DNA (6Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). The bulk of telomeric DNA is replicated by the semiconservative DNA replication machinery. The highly repetitive G-rich sequences at the ends of telomeres can adopt unusual DNA secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes (7Verdun R.E. Karlseder J.

Additionally, these secondary structures may also prevent the access of repair enzymes to damaged telomeric DNA. Thus, telomeric DNA presents a challenge to DNA replication and repair, and an appropriate coordination between specialized DNA replication/repair proteins and the shelterin proteins is essential for telomere integrity.

RTS patients who do not die from cancer have a normal life span. However, they show features of “segmental premature aging” such as growth retardation, poikiloderma, hair loss, cataracts, and bony malformations, and thus RTS is considered a premature aging syndrome (31Hoki Y.

Together, these observations suggest that RECQL4, like WRN, may play a role in telomere maintenance. We set out to look for telomeric abnormalities in RTS patient cells and RECQL4-depleted human cells and characterized interactions between RECQL4, shelterin proteins, telomeric D-loops, and WRN. The results showed that RECQL4 localizes at telomeres in replicative human cells and that the frequency of fragile telomeres is higher in RECQL4-depleted cells than in control cells, especially after DNA replication stress induced by aphidicolin exposure. Although RECQL4 can barely resolve telomeric D-loops, this activity is considerably enhanced in the presence of TRF1 or TRF2. RECQL4 also associates with WRN and stimulates WRN unwinding of telomeric D-loops in vitro. Collectively, our data support the view that RECQL4 participates in telomere maintenance by assisting in D-loop resolution. Wild-type (WT) human RECQL4 and helicase-dead RECQL4 with a C-terminal His9 tag in the pGEX6p1 vector (GE Healthcare) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli Rosetta2 (DE3) (Novagen) as described previously (19Rossi M.L.

The DNA replication and repair machinery fails to proceed through the telomeric D-loop, and WRN and RECQL4 are recruited by the shelterin complex (most probably by TRF2, as both of these RecQ helicases interact with it directly) to resolve this structure and thus maintain telomere integrity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RECQL4 (7.5, 15, and 30 nm) was incubated with either 0.5 nm non-telomeric D-loops (DLmx) or 0.5 nm telomeric D-loops (DL1) in a 10-μl reaction buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 50 mm KCl for 15 min on ice. Then 5 μl of stop dye (50% glycerol and 0.05% bromphenol blue) was added. Reactions were kept on ice until loading onto a 1% agarose/20 mm Tris, 10 mm acetic acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA (0.5 × TAE) gel and run in 0.5× TAE at 200 V for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Gel was dried in a gel dryer and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. The image was scanned and analyzed using ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare). Assays were performed at least in triplicate, and a representative gel shown. U2OS and HeLa cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Normal (GM00323 and GM01864) and RTS patient cell lines (AG05013 and AG18371) were obtained from Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). The cells were grown in Amniomax II medium (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Primary BJ cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium (ATCC, Manassas, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). RECQL4 knockdown (RECQL4 KD) and scrambled control cells (SCR) were prepared in primary BJ, U2OS, and HeLa cells according to the standard protocol using Mission shRNA lentiviral construct TRCN0000051169 from Sigma-Aldrich. Briefly, the shRNA vector was co-transfected with packing plasmid pCMV-dr8.2 DVPR (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) and envelope vector pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene) into human embryonic kidney 293T cells in DMEM with Hyclone FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using FuGENE® 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The medium was collected 48 h after transduction and filtered using a 0.45-μm PVDF membrane filter (Millipore). Lentivirus was applied to the cells, and infections were allowed to proceed for 48 h after which time puromycin was applied to select for those cells that had taken up the lentivirus. Quantitative PCR was performed to confirm that the RECQL4 was knocked down ∼90%, which was later confirmed by Western blotting prior to the cells being used in experiments. 100,000 U2OS cells were grown overnight in 6-well plates in 2 ml of antibiotic-free medium (DMEM plus 10% FBS). Then the cells were treated with 100 pmol of either control (Silencer Negative Control #1, Ambion) or RECQL4-targeted siRNA (target sequence CAAUACAGCUUACCGUACA, Dharmacon) in Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) for 6 h. Cells were then grown overnight and again treated with same siRNAs for 6 h. Cells were then grown in antibiotic (1%)-containing medium and harvested after 72 h, and the RECQL4 level was checked by Western blotting. For in vitro co-IP, purified WRN (7.5 pmol) and purified RECQL4 (15 pmol) were mixed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 100 μg/ml BSA and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. For RECQL4-TRF2 co-IP, the proteins were mixed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Then, precoated antibody-agarose beads (anti-rabbit WRN and normal rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the protein mix, and the tubes were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. After incubation the beads were washed four times in washing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer, and resolved on a 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE followed by Western analysis. The RECQL4 was detected by polyclonal anti rabbit-RECQL4 (19Rossi M.L. Ghosh A.K. Kulikowicz T. Croteau D.L. Bohr V.A. DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 796-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and rabbit TrueBlot HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (eBioscience) using an ECL kit following the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare). For in vivo co-IP of TRF2 by RECQL4, U2OS cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)), and co-IP was performed as described elsewhere using anti-TRF2 (Imgenex, mouse) and anti-RECQL4 (19Rossi M.L. Ghosh A.K. Kulikowicz T. Croteau D.L. Bohr V.A. DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 796-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (rabbit). For co-IP of WRN with FLAG-RECQL4, U2OS cells were first transduced with FLAG-RECQL4 and empty vector plasmids using Lipofectamine LTX following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer in the presence of 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide. WRN was detected with polyclonal anti-rabbit WRN antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and FLAG-RECQL4 was detected with anti-rabbit FLAG antibody (Sigma) using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). U2OS or HeLa cells (untreated, RECQL4-specific, or scrambled shRNA-treated, as indicated) were plated on Lab-Tek II chambered glass slides (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) at a density of 20,000 cells/chamber, grown overnight, and then treated with 2 gray IR where indicated. For cell cycle-dependent studies, cells were treated with 2 mm hydroxyurea (Sigma) or 2 mm nocodazole (Sigma) for 16 h as indicated. Hydroxyurea- and nocodazole-containing medium was then replaced by DMEM, and the cells were fixed immediately. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Following a final wash with PBS, cells were blocked overnight with 5% FBS in PBS. Then the cells were treated with primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C and secondary antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C after washing in PBS (five times for 3 min). Then the cells were washed again with PBS (five times for 3 min) and treated with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). The following antibodies were used as described under “Results.” Primary antibodies were: 53BP1 (Novus, 1:100, rabbit), TRF1 (Abcam TRF-78, 1:50, mouse), TRF2 (Imgenex, 1:50, mouse), RECQL4 (in-house) (19Rossi M.L. Ghosh A.K. Kulikowicz T. Croteau D.L. Bohr V.A. DNA Repair. 2010; 9: 796-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (1:100, rabbit or Santa Cruz K-16, 1:100, goat), and WRN (Santa Cruz, 1:100, rabbit). Secondary antibodies were: donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000) and donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 (1:200 for TRF-78 and 1:1000 for others) (all from Invitrogen). All of the dilutions were prepared in blocking solution (5% FBS). Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 confocal microscope (×40 magnification) with a Hamamatsu C9100-13 camera at −65 °C. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Volocity 5.5 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Images of individual representative cells were cropped from the original images and are shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 5. To further clarify the coexistence of two signals, images of partially colocalized foci were cropped and visualized as three-dimensional images as shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 5. The Pearson coefficients of these individual foci were calculated using Volocity software. For a better representation (supplemental Fig. 3), colocalization channels (positive products of the differences of the means for the two channels) were generated to highlight the colocalized foci. For quantification purpose, the foci at which two signals are intersected (colocalized foci) are marked and calculated using the same software.FIGURE 3Telomeric 53BP1 foci in RECQL4 knockdown HeLa and U2OS cells.

https://openalex.org/W2026299157,"Cytoskeleton modifications are required for neuronal stem cells to acquire neuronal polarization. Little is known, however, about mechanisms that orchestrate cytoskeleton remodeling along neuritogenesis. Here, we show that the silencing of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) impairs the initial sprouting of neurites upon induction of differentiation of the 1C11 neuroectodermal cell line, indicating that PrPC is necessary to neuritogenesis. Such PrPC function relies on its capacity to negatively regulate the clustering, activation, and signaling activity of β1 integrins at the plasma membrane. β1 Integrin aggregation caused by PrPC depletion triggers overactivation of the RhoA-Rho kinase-LIMK-cofilin pathway, which, in turn, alters the turnover of focal adhesions, increases the stability of actin microfilaments, and in fine impairs neurite formation. Inhibition of Rho kinases is sufficient to compensate for the lack of PrPC and to restore neurite sprouting. We also observe an increased secretion of fibronectin in the surrounding milieu of PrPC-depleted 1C11 cells, which likely self-sustains β1 integrin signaling overactivation and contributes to neuritogenesis defect. Our overall data reveal that PrPC contributes to the acquisition of neuronal polarization by modulating β1 integrin activity, cell interaction with fibronectin, and cytoskeleton dynamics.—Loubet, D., Dakowski, C., Pietri, M., Pradines, E., Bernard, S., Callebert, J., Ardila-Osorio, H., Mouillet-Richard, S., Launay, J.

https://openalex.org/W2169538397,"The interaction between chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1, plays an important role in stem cell mobilization and migration in ischemic tissues. MicroRNAs (miRs) are key regulators of stem cell function and are involved in regulation of stem cell survival and differentiation to adopt different cell lineages. In this study, we show that ischemia inhibits the expression of miR-150 in BM-derived mononuclear cells (MNC) and activates its target Cxcr4 gene. Our results show that miR-150/CXCR4 cascade enhances MNC mobilization and migration. By using mouse acute myocardial infarction (MI) model, we found that MNCs in peripheral blood (PB) were increased significantly at day 5 after AMI as compared to control group and the number of CXCR4 positive MNCs both in bone marrow (BM) and PB was also markedly increased after MI. Analysis by microarray-based miRNA profiling and real-time PCR revealed that the expression of miR-150 which targets Cxcr4 gene as predicted was significantly downregulated in BM-MNCs after MI. Abrogation of miR-150 markedly increased CXCR4 protein expression suggesting its target gene. To show that miR-150 regulates MNC mobilization, knockdown of miR-150 in BM-MNCs by specific antisense inhibitor resulted in their higher migration ability in vitro as compared to scramble-transfected MNCs. Furthermore, in vivo BM transplantation of MNCs lacking miR-150 expression by lentiviral vector into the irradiated wild type mice resulted in the increased number of MNCs in PB after AMI as compared to control. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ischemia mobilizes BM stem cells via miR-150/CXCR4 dependent mechanism and miR-150 may be a novel therapeutic target for stem cell migration to the ischemic tissue for neovascularization and repair."
https://openalex.org/W2037981058,"The ability of Tau to act as a potent inhibitor of kinesin's processive run length in vitro suggests that it may actively participate in the regulation of axonal transport in vivo. However, it remains unclear how kinesin-based transport could then proceed effectively in neurons, where Tau is expressed at high levels. One potential explanation is that Tau, a conformationally dynamic protein, has multiple modes of interaction with the microtubule, not all of which inhibit kinesin's processive run length. Previous studies support the hypothesis that Tau has at least two modes of interaction with microtubules, but the mechanisms by which Tau adopts these different conformations and their functional consequences have not been investigated previously. In the present study, we have used single molecule imaging techniques to demonstrate that Tau inhibits kinesin's processive run length in an isoform-dependent manner on GDP-microtubules stabilized with either paclitaxel or glycerol/DMSO but not guanosine-5'-((α,β)-methyleno)triphosphate (GMPCPP)-stabilized microtubules. Furthermore, the order of Tau addition to microtubules before or after polymerization has no effect on the ability of Tau to modulate kinesin motility regardless of the stabilizing agent used. Finally, the processive run length of kinesin is reduced on GMPCPP-microtubules relative to GDP-microtubules, and kinesin's velocity is enhanced in the presence of 4-repeat long Tau but not the 3-repeat short isoform. These results shed new light on the potential role of Tau in the regulation of axonal transport, which is more complex than previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W1981638948,"Loss of FMR1 gene function results in fragile X syndrome. Here, the authors demonstrate that the Drosophila fragile X homolog dFMR1 is involved in the RNA editing pathway via interaction with the enzyme dADAR and suggest that proper NMJ synaptic architecture requires modulation of dADAR activity by dFMR1. Loss of FMR1 gene function results in fragile X syndrome, the most common heritable form of intellectual disability. The protein encoded by this locus (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that is thought to primarily act as a translational regulator; however, recent studies have implicated FMRP in other mechanisms of gene regulation. We found that the Drosophila fragile X homolog (dFMR1) biochemically interacted with the adenosine-to-inosine RNA-editing enzyme dADAR. Adar and Fmr1 mutant larvae exhibited distinct morphological neuromuscular junction (NMJ) defects. Epistasis experiments based on these phenotypic differences revealed that Adar acts downstream of Fmr1 and that dFMR1 modulates dADAR activity. Furthermore, sequence analyses revealed that a loss or overexpression of dFMR1 affects editing efficiency on certain dADAR targets with defined roles in synaptic transmission. These results link dFMR1 with the RNA-editing pathway and suggest that proper NMJ synaptic architecture requires modulation of dADAR activity by dFMR1."
https://openalex.org/W1983852358,"Computational methods have led two groups to predict the endogenous presence of a highly conserved, amidated, 14-aa neuropeptide called either spexin or NPQ. NPQ/spexin is part of a larger prohormone that contains 3 sets of RR residues, suggesting that it could yield more than one bioactive peptide; however, no in vivo activity has been demonstrated for any peptide processed from this precursor. Here we demonstrate biological activity for two peptides present within proNPQ/spexin. NPQ/spexin (NWTPQAMLYLKGAQ-NH(2)) and NPQ 53-70 (FISDQSRRKDLSDRPLPE) have differing renal and cardiovascular effects when administered intracerebroventricularly or intravenously into rats. Intracerebroventricular injection of NPQ/spexin produced a 13 ± 2 mmHg increase in mean arterial pressure, a 38 ± 8 bpm decrease in heart rate, and a profound decrease in urine flow rate. Intracerebroventricular administration of NPQ 53-70 produced a 26 ± 9 bpm decrease in heart rate with no change in mean arterial pressure, and a marked increase in urine flow rate. Intraventricular NPQ/spexin and NPQ 53-70 also produced antinociceptive activity in the warm water tail withdrawal assay in mice (ED(50)<30 and 10 nmol for NPQ/spexin and NPQ 53-70, respectively). We conclude that newly identified peptides derived from the NPQ/spexin precursor contribute to CNS-mediated control of arterial blood pressure and salt and water balance and modulate nociceptive responses."
https://openalex.org/W2104242851,"Metformin causes an AMP/ATP ratio increase and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. Since caveolin-1 (Cav-1) plays a role in AMPK activation and energy balance, we investigated whether Cav-1 could participate in metformin's inhibitory effect on IGF1 signaling. The effect of metformin was studied in two non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, Calu-1 and Calu-6, expressing higher and lower amounts of Cav-1, respectively. In Calu-1, but not in Calu-6 cells, metformin reduced phosphorylation of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) substrates Akt and Forkhead transcription factor 3a (FOXO3a), inhibited IGF1-dependent FOXO3a nuclear exit, and decreased IGF1-dependent cell proliferation. Here, we show that sensitivity of NSCLC cells to metformin was dependent on Cav-1 expression and that metformin required Cav-1 to induce AMPK phosphorylation and AMP/ATP ratio increase. Cav-1 silencing in Calu-1 and overexpression in Calu-6 reduced and improved, respectively, the inhibitory effect of metformin on IGF1-dependent Akt phosphorylation. Prolonged metformin treatment in Calu-6 cells induced a dose-dependent expression increase of Cav-1 and OCT1, a metformin transporter. Cav-1 and OCT1 expression was associated with the antiproliferative effect of metformin in Calu-6 cells (IC50=18 mM). In summary, these data suggest that Cav-1 is required for metformin action in NSCLC cells.—Salani, B., Maffioli, S., Hamoudane, M., Parodi, A., Ravera, S., Passalacqua, M., Alama, A., Nhiri, M., Cordera, R., Maggi, D.

https://openalex.org/W1989758257,"Background Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in Botswana and elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa. We sought to examine whether HPV vaccine is acceptable among parents in Botswana, which recently licensed the vaccine to prevent cervical cancer. Methods and Findings We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2009, around the time the vaccine was first licensed, with adults recruited in general medicine and HIV clinics in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana. Although only 9% (32/376) of respondents had heard of HPV vaccine prior to the survey, 88% (329/376) said they definitely will have their adolescent daughters receive HPV vaccine. Most respondents would get the vaccine for their daughters at a public or community clinic (42%) or a gynecology or obstetrician's office (39%), and 74% would get it for a daughter if it were available at her school. Respondents were more likely to say that they definitely will get HPV vaccine for their daughters if they had less education (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.07–0.58) or lived more than 30 kilometers from the capital, Gaborone (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.06–4.93). Other correlates of acceptability were expecting to be involved in the decision to get HPV vaccine, thinking the vaccine would be hard to obtain, and perceiving greater severity of HPV-related diseases. Conclusions HPV vaccination of adolescent girls would be highly acceptable if the vaccine became widely available to the daughters of healthcare seeking parents in Gaborone, Botswana. Potential HPV vaccination campaigns should provide more information about HPV and the vaccine as well as work to minimize barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2062477194,"MRE11-RAD50 is a highly conserved multifunctional DNA repair factor. Here, we show that MRE11-RAD50 cleaves the covalent 3'-phosphotyrosyl-DNA bonds that join topoisomerase 1 (Top1) to the DNA backbone and that are the hallmark of damage caused by Top1 poisons such as camptothecin. Cleavage generates a 3'-phosphate DNA end that MRE11-RAD50 can resect in an ATP-regulated reaction, to produce a 3'-hydroxyl that can prime repair synthesis. The 3'-phosphotyrosyl cleavage activity maps to the MRE11 active site. These results define a new activity of MRE11 and distinguish MRE11-RAD50 functions in repair of Top1-DNA complexes and double-strand breaks."

We are interested in defining which elements of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (Chd1) remodeler are necessary and sufficient for sliding nucleosomes. This work focuses on the polypeptide segment that joins the ATPase motor to the C-terminal DNA-binding domain. We identify amino acid positions outside the ATPase motor that, when altered, dramatically reduce nucleosome sliding ability and yet have only ∼3-fold reduction in ATPase stimulation by nucleosomes. These residues therefore appear to play a role in functionally coupling ATP hydrolysis to nucleosome sliding, and suggest that the ATPase motor requires cooperation with external elements to slide DNA past the histone core.

In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is extensively packaged into chromatin, the basic unit of which is the nucleosome. By the nature of the DNA wrapping around the histone core, the nucleosome restricts access to genomic DNA and therefore must be reorganized for many basic cellular processes including DNA replication, recombination, repair, and gene transcription. Chromatin remodelers play a key role in altering chromatin accessibility, and are essential factors for nucleosome eviction, histone variant exchange, and nucleosome sliding (reviewed in Refs. 1Clapier C.R.

Chromatin remodelers encompass an increasingly diverse set of proteins and assemblies and have been classified into several families, the best characterized of which include SWI/SNF, ISWI, INO80, and CHD. Each family possesses a characteristic collection of auxiliary domains and/or subunits, yet all remodelers share a common SWI2/SNF2-type ATPase motor (6Gangaraju V.K. Bartholomew B. Mutat. Res. 2007; 618: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. FEBS J. 2011; 278: 3579-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The ATPase motor has been shown to engage with nucleosomal DNA approximately two helical turns from the nucleosome dyad (superhelical location 2), and ATP hydrolysis is essential for driving the nucleosome sliding reaction (8Schwanbeck R. Xiao H. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39933-39941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Biol. 2006; 13: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SWI2/SNF2-type ATPase motor is also found in proteins that do not slide nucleosomes but disrupt other protein-DNA complexes, such as bacterial RapA and eukaryotic Rad54 (11Solinger J.A. Kiianitsa K. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1175-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 12Sukhodolets M.V. Cabrera J.E. Zhi H. Jin D.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3330-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The conservation of the SWI2/SNF2-type ATPase motor outside the chromatin remodeler subfamilies suggests that remodelers possess additional elements that direct action of the ATPase motor to nucleosomes. Although non-ATPase domains are believed to target chromatin remodelers to nucleosomes (13Glatt S. Alfieri C. Müller C.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it is not known whether or how regions outside the ATPase motor might be essential for nucleosome sliding. To define the minimal elements required for nucleosome sliding, we have focused on yeast Chd1 chromatin remodeler as a model system. Chd1 was named for three conserved motifs: a pair of N-terminal chromodomains, a central helicase-like ATPase motor, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (Chd) 2The abbreviations used are: Chd1chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1SF1superfamily 1SF2superfamily 2S.D.standard deviationCDcircular dichroism. (14Delmas V. Stokes D.G. Perry R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 2414-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Like ISWI-type remodelers, Chd1 can assemble nucleosomes, generate evenly spaced nucleosomal arrays, and move mononucleosomes to the center of short DNA fragments (15Lusser A. Urwin D.L. Kadonaga J.T. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Stockdale C. Flaus A. Ferreira H. Owen-Hughes T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16279-16288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For yeast Chd1, we previously showed that although deletion of the chromodomains or DNA-binding domain reduced nucleosome sliding ability, neither the chromodomains nor DNA-binding domain were essential for nucleosome sliding (17Hauk G. McKnight J.N. Nodelman I.M. Bowman G.D. Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the course of our studies, we discovered that the protein segment between the ATPase motor and DNA-binding domain greatly influenced the efficiency of nucleosome sliding. Here we describe the biochemical characterization of a set of yeast Chd1 variant proteins that identify residues between the DNA-binding domain and ATPase motor critical for coupling nucleosome-stimulated ATP hydrolysis to nucleosome sliding. chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 superfamily 1 superfamily 2 standard deviation circular dichroism. Truncated constructs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Chd1 were topo-cloned into pDEST17 vectors following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). N-terminal cloning primers included a Prescission Protease cleavage sequence (LEVLFQ/GP) immediately prior to residue 118 (S. cerevisiae numbering) to allow removal of the His tag and pDEST17-associated sequences. Variant Chd1 constructs containing internal deletions and amino acid substitutions were generated using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). The residues altered are denoted in Fig. 2. Using the autoinduction method (18Studier F.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar), Chd1 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) containing two additional plasmids: a Trigger Factor chaperone overexpression plasmid (Li Ma and Guy Montelione, Rutgers University) and the RIL plasmid for rare tRNAs (Stratagene). Two liters of autoinduction media were inoculated with 20 ml of overnight culture, grown for 2 h at 37 °C, cooled on ice, and further cultured at 18 °C for 18 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole) containing 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, and 1 mm DTT. Cells were lysed by adding lysozyme to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and disrupted by sonication on ice, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 20 min. The clarified lysate was applied onto a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 200 ml of buffer A, and Chd1 protein was eluted with buffer A supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing Chd1 proteins were pooled and diluted 5-fold with buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol) and applied onto ion-exchange columns pre-equilibrated with buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). Chd1118–939 was applied onto a Q-FF HiTrap column, whereas all other Chd1 proteins were applied to SP-FF HiTrap columns (GE Healthcare). After washing with 200 ml of buffer C, Chd1 proteins were eluted with a linear gradient to 50% buffer D (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol). Fractions containing Chd1 proteins were pooled and incubated overnight with recombinant Precision protease at 4 °C to remove the N-terminal tag. Cleaved protein was then re-passed over a HisTrap affinity column pre-equilibrated with buffer A, collected in the flow-through, concentrated, and further purified on a Superdex S200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare). Size exclusion chromatography was carried out in buffer E (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The peak fractions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE, concentrated, and maintained at −80 °C until needed. Protein concentrations were determined by quantification of a dilution series on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and comparison against known standards. Expression and purification of histone proteins were carried out as previously described (19Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The assembly of histone octamers and nucleosomes were performed as described (Ref. 19Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar and web protocol from the Tsukiyama Laboratory). The DNA used for nucleosomes was derived from the pGEM-601 plasmid. Fluorescently labeled DNA was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using a pair of primers with the following sequences: 5′-Cy5-CA GGA TGT ATA TAT CTG ACA CGT GCC TGG and 5′-GGA AAG CAT GAT TCT TCA CAC CGA GTT C (IDT). These primers amplified a 208-bp fragment with the 601 positioning sequence (20Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) at one end. Unlabeled DNA was used for ATPase assays, and was generated by digesting a 34-mer array of 601 sequences. Nucleosome sliding was performed as described previously (17Hauk G. McKnight J.N. Nodelman I.M. Bowman G.D. Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 21Längst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 22Eberharter A. Längst G. Becker P.B. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 377: 344-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), with some variations. The buffer used for nucleosome sliding contained the following: 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% sucrose, 0.1 mg/ml of BSA, and 1 mm DTT. Protein and nucleosome reagents were diluted with the above sliding buffer and reactions were initiated by addition of 2.5 mm ATP in the same buffer. All protein and nucleosome reagents were kept on ice, and then incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to addition of ATP. Sliding reactions were quenched at the desired time points by immediately placing on ice after addition of stop DNA (up to 25 μg of plasmid pJ201 containing a 34-mer array of 601 DNA sequences) and 25 mm EDTA in 20 mm HEPES buffer pH 7.5 containing 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml of BSA, 5% sucrose, and 1 mm DTT. Reactions were then loaded onto 7% native polyacrylamide gels (60:1 acrylamide:bis) and run at 150 V for 4 h at 4 °C. Gels were visualized using a Typhoon 9410 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare) and quantified with ImageJ. Nucleosome sliding rates were obtained by fitting the fraction of nucleosomes shifted over time to linear or exponential equations. Although under multiple turnover conditions (1 nm remodeler, 100 nm nucleosome), sliding reactions using Chd1ΔNC progressed too quickly to directly obtain a linear fit to early time points, and therefore progress curves were fit in KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) to a single exponential equation, y = m1 + m2 × (1 − exp(−m3 × x)). Several variants (Chd1ΔNCΔ961−974, Chd1ΔNCΔ977–994, Chd1ΔNCΔ995–1005, Chd1ΔNCV3, and Chd1ΔNCV6) were also too fast to directly obtain initial sliding rates, and were fit to a double exponential equation, y = m1 + m2 × (1 − exp(−m3 × x)) + m4 × (1 − exp(−m5 × x)). For each of these variants, the two rates differed by ∼10-fold, and the faster rate was similar to that of Chd1ΔNC, but had an amplitude 3–5-fold lower than the slower rate. The appearance of a dominant, slower rate suggests that these amino acid changes altered a rate-limiting step in the sliding reaction, however, with the experiments described here, we cannot say what stage of the cycle is altered. Sliding rates for the other Chd1 variants, which were both slower and failed to slide nucleosomes to the same extent under these conditions, were obtained by linearly fitting the fraction of nucleosomes shifted over the first 5 min (20 min for Chd1ΔNCΔ932–940 and Chd1ΔNCV1). To report the observed initial sliding rate for all remodelers, the equations for the exponential fits were differentiated at time = 0. For the single exponential fits, this yields the product of the rate times the total amount of nucleosomes shifted. For the double exponential fits, the initial rate is the sum of each rate times a fraction of the total amount of nucleosome shifted. Sliding experiments were performed three or more times, and the fits to individual reactions gave R values of ≥0.98. All nucleosome sliding gels shown are representative of three or more experiments. Increasing concentrations of Chd1 proteins were mixed with 100 nm Cy5-labeled (0-N-63) nucleosomes in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml of BSA and 5% sucrose in a final volume of 10 μl. The binding reactions were incubated for 2 h at room temperature (22 °C) and then analyzed by native PAGE as described above for sliding reactions. Circular dichroism (CD) secondary structure measurements were collected on an Aviv Associates (Biomedical Lakewood, NJ) model 400 circular dichroism spectropolarimeter device. Prior to CD measurements, protein samples were dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl. Far-UV CD spectra were acquired in a 195–260 nm wavelength range at 20 °C for 0.5 mg/ml of protein (Chd1ΔNC or Chd1ΔNCΔ932–940) in 400 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl, using a 1-mm path-length cuvette. ATPase rates were monitored using an NADH-coupled system as previously described (23Kiianitsa K. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 321: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). All reagents were kept on ice and preincubated at room temperature for 10 min before initiation of the reactions with the addition of 2.5 mm ATP and 5.0 mm MgCl2. The concentration of Chd1 proteins was 50 nm, with the indicated amount of (0-N-63) nucleosome substrates. The DNA substrate was a 208-bp duplex equivalent to that used for nucleosome reconstitution. The reported DNA- and nucleosome-stimulated ATPase rates were obtained after subtraction of basal rates in the absence of substrates. Substrate-stimulated and basal ATPase rates are reported in Table 1.TABLE 1Rates of ATP hydrolysis and nucleosome sliding for yeast Chd1 proteins described in this studya The reported DNA- and nucleosome-stimulated activities were calculated by subtracting basal ATPase activities (without substrate) from total ATPase activities in the presence of 500 nm DNA or nucleosome substrates. Open table in a new tab a The reported DNA- and nucleosome-stimulated activities were calculated by subtracting basal ATPase activities (without substrate) from total ATPase activities in the presence of 500 nm DNA or nucleosome substrates. We previously showed that the truncated yeast Chd1 protein used for crystal structure determination (residues 142–939) could slide nucleosomes, indicating that the DNA-binding domain was not essential for nucleosome sliding (17Hauk G. McKnight J.N. Nodelman I.M. Bowman G.D. Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Nucleosome sliding activity of this truncated Chd1 remodeler, however, was extremely poor and required comparatively high (micromolar) concentrations, likely due to inefficient localization accompanying loss of the DNA-binding domain. In the course of optimizing construct borders for crystallization, we found that inclusion of residues 940–978, a region distinct from the ATPase motor, noticeably improved nucleosome sliding activity. In yeast Chd1, structural information is now available for the chromodomain-ATPase motor (17Hauk G. McKnight J.N. Nodelman I.M. Bowman G.D. Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and the DNA-binding domain (24Ryan D.P. Sundaramoorthy R. Martin D. Singh V. Owen-Hughes T. EMBO J. 2011; 30: 2596-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Approximately 87 amino acid residues separate the ATPase motor (which includes a ∼50 residue C-terminal bridge segment that folds against the ATPase core and ends around residue 922) from the DNA-binding domain (residues 1009–1274). The C-terminal residues of the crystallization construct (residues 923–939) were disordered in the crystal structure and encompass part of a highly conserved sequence motif that begins with a strictly conserved tryptophan at position 932. Following residue 955 of the 87 residue linker, sequence conservation drops off until the beginning of the DNA-binding domain. To investigate the extent that residues between the ATPase motor/C-terminal bridge and DNA-binding domain may contribute to nucleosome sliding, four truncated Chd1 proteins were studied (Fig. 1A). All protein constructs lacked the first 117 residues, which are not conserved among Chd1 orthologs and not required for nucleosome sliding or centering (17Hauk G. McKnight J.N. Nodelman I.M. Bowman G.D. Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To investigate nucleosome sliding activities, end-positioned mononucleosomes were generated using the 601 positioning sequence (20Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) flanked by 63 additional base pairs on one side (referred to as 0-N-63). The ATP-dependent mobilization of these end-positioned nucleosomes was monitored by native PAGE, where slowed migration indicates a shift of nucleosomes toward the center of a DNA fragment (21Längst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In accordance with previously reported nucleosome centering activity of Chd1 (16Stockdale C. Flaus A. Ferreira H. Owen-Hughes T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16279-16288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), a yeast Chd1 protein that possessed all three conserved domains (spanning residues 118–1274), was able to efficiently shift the majority of end-positioned nucleosomes to more centrally located positions on the DNA fragment (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–7). Chd1 produced two major up-shifted nucleosome bands. This behavior is similar to movement of 601 containing nucleosomes by ISWI-type remodelers such as NURF, which was shown with high resolution mapping to correspond to two centrally located positions (8Schwanbeck R. Xiao H. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39933-39941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To simplify the nomenclature of proteins containing internal deletions as described later, the Chd1 protein construct spanning residues 118 to 1274 will be hereafter referred to as Chd1ΔNC, which signifies that it possesses deletions at both the N and C terminus yet maintains the core chromodomains, ATPase motor, and DNA-binding domain. Consistent with previous findings (17Hauk G. McKnight J.N. Nodelman I.M. Bowman G.D. Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), a more truncated construct (Chd1118–939) that possessed just the chromodomains and central ATPase motor was also able to slide nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner, but much less efficiently than Chd1ΔNC. In a 2-h incubation, 10 μm Chd1118–939 was required to shift just ∼23% of the nucleosome pool away from the starting position (lane 31), compared with 1 nm Chd1ΔNC sufficient for shifting >80% of nucleosomes (lane 3). Longer protein constructs that possessed more native sequence C-terminal to the ATPase motor but still lacked the C-terminal DNA-binding domain (Chd1118–978 and Chd1118–1014) displayed intermediate activities. These longer chromodomain-ATPase proteins were significantly more active in sliding than Chd1118–939, requiring ∼100-fold less protein to mobilize a similar fraction of nucleosomes (compare lanes 13, 21, and 31). This marked improvement in sliding activity suggested that, independently of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain, some element in the segment linking the ATPase motor to the DNA-binding domain contributed to efficient nucleosome sliding. The four truncated yeast Chd1 proteins were also assayed for ATPase activities in the presence and absence of DNA and nucleosome substrates (Fig. 1C). ATP hydrolysis by Chd1 is regulated by the N-terminal chromodomains and required for sliding. When the chromodomain-ATPase interface is intact, maximal ATPase stimulation requires nucleosome substrates (17Hauk G. McKnight J.N. Nodelman I.M. Bowman G.D. Mol. Cell. 2010; 39: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This preference for nucleosome substrates over naked DNA was observed with Chd1ΔNC, which showed a hydrolysis rate of 308 ± 4 ATP min−1 for 250 nm (0-N-63) nucleosomes compared with 46 ± 1 ATP min−1 for an equal amount of DNA. In contrast, at the same enzyme concentration (50 nm remodeler) the other three C-terminal-truncated proteins did not show significant levels of ATPase stimulation by DNA or nucleosome substrates relative to the no substrate control (Fig. 1C). This absence of detectable ATPase activation of Chd1118–939, Chd1118–978, and Chd1118–1014 highlights the severity of deleting the DNA-binding domain. Given the complications of comparing truncated Chd1 proteins with extremely low sliding and ATPase activities due to a commonly missing DNA-binding domain, we sought to investigate the importance of the segment connecting the ATPase motor and DNA-binding domain with internal deletions and point substitutions. To determine which residues between the ATPase motor and DNA-binding domain contribute most significantly to nucleosome sliding, five deletion constructs were generated (Fig. 2A). Given the significant reduction in nucleosome sliding and ATPase activities in the absence of the DNA-binding domain, the Chd1ΔNC construct, which maintains the chromodomains, ATPase motor, and DNA-binding domain, was used as the parent into which deletions were introduced. To compare the impact of internal deletions on nucleosome sliding activities, Chd1 proteins were tested over a 1000-fold concentration range for their ability to shift end-positioned nucleosomes (Fig. 3). The parent protein, Chd1ΔNC, shifted approximately half of the nucleosomes to a single, more slowly migrating band within 5 min at the lowest remodeler concentration (1 nm). At longer time points and higher Chd1ΔNC concentrations, the majority (>80%) of end-positioned nucleosomes were shifted to one or two primary bands representing more centrally positioned nucleosomes. The five internal deletions impacted nucleosome sliding activity to different extents. The two proteins with deletions closest to the ATPase motor, Chd1ΔNCΔ932–940 and Chd1ΔNCΔ941–955, were the least effective in sliding nucleosomes. Even after a 2-h incubation, the highest (1000 nm) concentration of Chd1ΔNCΔ932–940 was unable to shift all nucleosomes away from the end of the DNA fragment at all concentrations tested (Fig. 3, lane 19). Chd1ΔNCΔ941–955, in contrast, was able to shift nucleosomes away from the end position to a similar extent as Chd1ΔNC, but more slowly and requiring higher remodeler concentrations. For instance, in a 5-min reaction, 10 nm Chd1ΔNC shifted >80% of end-positioned nucleosomes, whereas 1000 nm Chd1ΔNCΔ941–955 left a significant fraction of nucleosomes unshifted (compare lanes 4 and 28). However, after 2 h, the majority of end-positioned nucleosomes were shifted by 100 and 1000 nm Chd1ΔNCΔ941–955 (lanes 27 and 29). The other three proteins, Chd1ΔNCΔ961–974, Chd1ΔNCΔ977–994, and Chd1ΔNCΔ995–1005, were much less impacted by the internal deletions, and showed similar patterns of shifted nucleosomes to those generated by Chd1ΔNC. These sliding experiments revealed that not all portions of the 87-residue segment connecting the ATPase motor with the DNA-binding domain were equally important for nucleosome sliding. To quantify the extent that disruptions in the segment linking the ATPase motor with the DNA-binding domain altered sliding activity of Chd1, time course experiments were used to calculate the initial nucleosome sliding rates. Sliding reactions were followed by native PAGE over a 2-h period, and the fraction of end-positioned nucleosomes shifted was determined at each time point (Fig. 4). As before, sliding of these end-positioned (0-N-63) nucleosomes yielded two primary bands, which were consistent with the repositioning of the histone octamer toward more central locations on the DNA fragment (21Längst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The lower of the two shifted bands always appeared earlier in the reaction, and in general the majority of the starting material shifted to this intermediate band before appearance of the upper shifted band (supplemental Fig. S1). For the purposes of calculating initial sliding rates, the fraction of shifted nucleosomes at each point was considered to be the measured intensities of all shifted bands divided by the sum of all nucleosome bands in each lane. Progress curves were fit to single or double exponentials as shown in Fig. 4. Initial sliding rates were calculated from exponential or linear fits to the data (Table 1; see “Experimental Procedures”). Using 1 nm remodeler and 100 nm (0-N-63) nucleosomes, Chd1ΔNC displayed an initial sliding rate of 11.7 ± 1.1 nm min−1. The three deletions closest to the DNA-binding domain, Chd1ΔNCΔ961–974, Chd1ΔNCΔ977–994, and Chd1ΔNCΔ995–1005, showed initial sliding rates that were ∼50–80% that of Chd1ΔNC (Table 1). The similar rates of these three internally deleted variants suggests that specific residues within the segment spanning 961–1005 are likely not making critical interactions with the rest of the remodeler or nucleosome substrate. Instead, these similar rates may reflect the general shortening of the distance between the ATPase motor and DNA-binding domain common to these deletion variants, which removed 11–18 residues. Given the extremely low sliding activity observed for the two remodeler variants with the most deleterious internal deletions, Chd1ΔNCΔ932–940 and Chd1ΔNCΔ941–955 (Fig. 3, lanes 12–29), 10- or 100-fold higher remodeler concentrations were used to follow nucleosome sliding. At 10 nm concentration, Chd1ΔNCΔ941–955 shifted nucleosomes with an apparent initial rate of 1.4 ± 0.3 nm min−1 (Fig. 4A). Adjusting for enzyme concentration, this variant therefore shifted nucleosomes ∼100-fold more slowly than observed for Chd1ΔNC. For Chd1ΔNCΔ932–940, the initial rate was even slower, only 0.34 ± 0.03 nm min−1 for 100 nm remodeler, or ∼3500-fold worse than observed for Chd1ΔNC (Table 1). To more finely dissect the contributions of residues encompassed in the most severe deletions, we generated eight Chd1ΔNC variants in the region spanning residues 932 to 955. These variants, referred to as Chd1ΔNCV1–Chd1ΔNCV8, possessed the same number of residues as Chd1ΔNC but had 1–4 amino acid substitutions (Fig. 2B). This region is highly charged, and a distinctive feature includes alternating clusters of acidic and basic residues. Comparing amino acid sequences of Chd1 orthologs in this region shows a conservation of electrostatic character, and a few positions (notably Trp932, Ile935, Ile936, and Pro937) are strongly conserved in identity. Charge-reversal substitutions were introduced to probe the importance of alternating positive and negatively charged clusters, and alanine substitutions were introduced to test the importance of conserved hydrophobic side chains. Similar to the five variants with internal deletions, the eight variant remodelers with point substitutions also showed a broad range of remodeling activities, with the most disruptive changes located in the N-terminal portion of the 932–955 segment (Fig. 4B). By far the least active variant was Chd1ΔNCV1. This variant, a single Trp → Ala substitution at position 932, shifted nucleosomes as poorly as the worst internal deletion variant, Chd1ΔNCΔ932–940"

Using commercial E. coli cell-free systems with the detergent Brij-35, we could rapidly produce milligram quantities of 13 unique GPCRs. Immunoaffinity purification yielded receptors at >90% purity. Secondary structure analysis using circular dichroism indicated that the purified receptors were properly folded. Microscale thermophoresis, a novel label-free and surface-free detection technique that uses thermal gradients, showed that these receptors bound their ligands. The secondary structure and ligand-binding results from cell-free produced proteins were comparable to those expressed and purified from HEK293 cells. Our study demonstrates that cell-free protein production using commercially available kits and optimal detergents is a robust technology that can be used to produce sufficient GPCRs for biochemical, structural, and functional analyses. This robust and simple method may further stimulate others to study the structure and function of membrane proteins."

However, the structural determinants of the interaction between extracellular ubiquitin and CXCR4 remain unknown. Utilizing C-terminal truncated ubiquitin and ubiquitin mutants, in which surface residues that are known to interact with ubiquitin binding domains in interacting proteins are mutated (Phe-4, Leu-8, Ile-44, Asp-58, Val-70), we provide evidence that the ubiquitin-CXCR4 interaction follows a two-site binding mechanism in which the hydrophobic surfaces surrounding Phe-4 and Val-70 are important for receptor binding, whereas the flexible C terminus facilitates receptor activation. Based on these findings and the available crystal structures, we then modeled the ubiquitin-CXCR4 interface with the RosettaDock software followed by small manual adjustments, which were guided by charge complementarity and anticipation of a conformational switch of CXCR4 upon activation. This model suggests three residues of CXCR4 (Phe-29, Phe-189, Lys-271) as potential interaction sites. Binding studies with HEK293 cells overexpressing wild type and CXCR4 after site-directed mutagenesis confirm that these residues are important for ubiquitin binding but that they do not contribute to the binding of stromal cell-derived factor 1α. Our findings suggest that the structural determinants of the CXCR4 agonist activity of ubiquitin mimic the typical structure-function relationship of chemokines. Furthermore, we provide evidence for separate and specific ligand binding sites on CXCR4. As exogenous ubiquitin has been shown to possess therapeutic potential, our findings are expected to facilitate the structure-based design of new compounds with ubiquitin-mimetic actions on CXCR4.

https://openalex.org/W2088297790,"Nitrogen availability regulates the transcription of genes required to degrade non-preferentially utilized nitrogen sources by governing the localization and function of transcription activators, Gln3 and Gat1. TorC1 inhibitor, rapamycin (Rap), and glutamine synthetase inhibitor, methionine sulfoximine (Msx), elicit responses grossly similar to those of limiting nitrogen, implicating both glutamine synthesis and TorC1 in the regulation of Gln3 and Gat1. To better understand this regulation, we compared Msx- versus Rap-elicited Gln3 and Gat1 localization, their DNA binding, nitrogen catabolite repression-sensitive gene expression, and the TorC1 pathway phosphatase requirements for these responses. Using this information we queried whether Rap and Msx inhibit sequential steps in a single, linear cascade connecting glutamine availability to Gln3 and Gat1 control as currently accepted or alternatively inhibit steps in two distinct parallel pathways. We find that Rap most strongly elicits nuclear Gat1 localization and expression of genes whose transcription is most Gat1-dependent. Msx, on the other hand, elicits nuclear Gln3 but not Gat1 localization and expression of genes that are most Gln3-dependent. Importantly, Rap-elicited nuclear Gln3 localization is absolutely Sit4-dependent, but that elicited by Msx is not. PP2A, although not always required for nuclear GATA factor localization, is highly required for GATA factor binding to nitrogen-responsive promoters and subsequent transcription irrespective of the gene GATA factor specificities.

In repressive, nitrogen-rich conditions, glutamine (or a glutamine metabolite) is thought to activate the TorC1 kinase (Fig. 1, Pathway 2) (25Crespo J.L. Powers T. Fowler B. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 6784-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). TorC1, in turn, phosphorylates Tap42, which facilitates complex formation between Tap42, the Sit4 or PP2A phosphatases, and TorC1 (26Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T.

When in ternary complexes with TorC1, Tap42-Sit4 and Tap42-PP2A binary complexes are inactive (29Yan G. Shen X. Jiang Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus inhibited, these phosphatases are unable to dephosphorylate Gln3 and thereby facilitate its dissociation from the Ure2-Gln3 complex, the latter being required for its nuclear localization (8Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). As a result, the UASGATA elements of NCR-sensitive genes remain unoccupied, and NCR-sensitive transcription is repressed (31Cox K.H. Rai R. Distler M. Daugherty J.R. Coffman J.A. Cooper T.G. J. Biol.

On the other hand, during nitrogen starvation, limitation, or inhibition of glutamine production by Msx, TorC1 activation, needed for Sit4 and PP2A inactivation, does not occur. This situation can also be mimicked by rapamycin treatment, which causes release of Tap42-Sit4 or Tap42-PP2A binary complexes from TorC1, concomitantly activating Sit4 and PP2A (29Yan G. Shen X. Jiang Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Activated Sit4-Tap42 complexes dephosphorylate Gln3, permitting it to dissociate from Ure2, enter the nucleus, bind to UASGATA elements, and activate transcription. The active Tap42-Sit4 and Tap42-PP2A complexes subsequently dissociate, yielding inactive Sit4 or PP2A (29Yan G. Shen X. Jiang Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although analyzed in much less detail, Gat1 was reported to be regulated similarly to Gln3 (8Beck T. Hall M.N. Nature. 1999; 402: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Despite the elegance of the TorC1 regulation model described above (Fig. 1, Pathway 2), accumulating evidence suggests the characteristics of nitrogen-responsive GATA factor regulation are not always congruent with the expectations it predicts (26Di Como C.J.

A major unanswered question critical to our understanding of the mechanisms of nitrogen-responsive GATA factor regulation is whether glutamine and TorC1 control Gln3 and Gat1 localization and/or function via a single linear pathway (Pathway 2) or two distinct pathways acting in parallel (Pathways 1 and 2). This is tantamount to asking (i) whether Msx functions at the top of the TorC1 regulatory cascade (Pathway 2 in Fig. 1) or alternatively functions independently of TorC1 (Pathway 1 in Fig. 1) or (ii) whether there is one input signal directing Gln3 and Gat1 to relocate into the nucleus or two input signals. Two observations raised the possibility that rapamycin and Msx may not function in the same cascade; Msx elicits nuclear Gln3 but not Gat1 localization (42Kulkarni A. Buford T.D. Rai R. Cooper T.G. FEMS Yeast Res. 2006; 6: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and Msx addition leads to increased Gln3 phosphorylation, whereas rapamycin treatment decreases it (40Tate J.J. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27195-27201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Whether additional differences pertinent to this question exist between Msx- and rapamycin-elicited responses is unknown because, in contrast with rapamycin, Msx-elicited responses remain largely uncharacterized. The purpose of this work has been to investigate the requirements of Msx-elicited GATA factor regulation at the levels of localization, DNA binding, and transcription using Gln3- versus Gat1-specific genes and to compare them with those elicited by rapamycin treatment. Because one versus two pathway GATA factor regulation predicts distinct experimental outcomes, the data we obtained specifically address this question.

Images (subsequently designated, primary images) were collected at room temperature using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a 100×/1.40 (Myc13 fluorescence) or 63×/1.40 (live cell GFP assay) Plan-Aprochromat oil objective, a Zeiss Axio camera, and Zeiss Axiovision 4.1 software. Only primary, unaltered .zvi file images were used for scoring intracellular Gln-Myc13, Gat1-Myc13, Gln3-GFP, and Gat1-GFP distributions as described below. For the microscopic images presented, primary .zvi files were converted to .tif files and processed for publication using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator software. Gamma settings of microscopic images presented in this work were unaltered or only minimally altered where necessary to avoid loss of detail relative to what was observed in the microscope. Changes were applied uniformly to the image presented and as similarly as possible from one image to another. We manually scored Gln3-Myc13 and Gat1-Myc13 localization in 200 or more cells from multiple, randomly chosen fields from which each immunofluorescence image was taken. All of the cells in the two images collected from each Gln3-GFP or Gat1-GFP culture sample (average number of cells scored per sample was 91). In all cases, scoring was performed using primary, unaltered .zvi file images and Zeiss AxioVision 4.6.3 software. Cells were classified into one of three categories: cytoplasmic (cytoplasmic fluorescence only), nuclear-cytoplasmic (fluorescence in the cytoplasm and the nucleus), or nuclear (fluorescence exclusively restricted to the nucleus). These categories are color-coded as red, yellow, and green bars, respectively, in the histograms. Criteria applied in the determination of GATA factor localization, including panels of standard images demonstrating the differences between the categories for both immunofluorescence and GFP fluorescence measurements appear in Fig. 2 of Tate et al.

https://openalex.org/W2149325815,"Perinatal flavour learning through the maternal diet is known to enhance flavour preference and acceptance of flavoured food in many species, yet still little is known about the mechanism underlying perinatal flavour learning. Previously we found positive effects of perinatal flavour learning on food intake, growth and behaviour of piglets postweaning, but no increased preference for the flavour. This suggests that flavour learning in pigs works through a reduction of weaning stress by the presence of the familiar flavour instead. The aim of this study was to investigate whether perinatal flavour learning reduces stress at weaning, and whether the effect is stronger when the familiar flavour is present in the food. Sows were offered an anethol-flavoured diet (Flavour treatment) or control diet (Control treatment) during late gestation and lactation. Flavour and Control piglets were provided with anethol either in their food (Food treatment) or in the air (Air treatment) after weaning. Preweaning and postweaning treatments did not affect food intake, preference or growth in the first two weeks postweaning but flavour treatment reduced the latency to eat (24 versus 35 hours, P = 0.02) and within-pen variation in growth (SD within-pen: 0.7 versus 1.2 kg, P<0.001). Salivary cortisol levels tended to be lower four and seven hours postweaning for Flavour piglets compared to Control piglets (4 hours: 2.5 versus 3.0 ng/ml, P = 0.05, 7 hours: 3.1 versus 3.4 ng/ml, P = 0.08). Flavour piglets played more and showed less damaging behaviours than Control piglets, indicating that the familiar flavour reduced stress around weaning. Few interaction effects were found between preweaning and postweaning treatment, and no effects of postweaning treatment. We conclude that in the newly weaned pig, perinatal flavour learning results in a reduction of stress when the familiar flavour is present, regardless of providing the flavour in the food or in the air."
https://openalex.org/W1977684973,"The protist parasite Trypanosoma cruzi has evolved the ability to transit between completely different hosts and to replicate in adverse environments. In particular, the epimastigote form, the replicative stage inside the vector, is subjected to nutritional and osmotic stresses during its development. In this work, we describe the biochemical and global gene expression changes of epimastigotes under hyperosmotic conditions. Hyperosmotic stress resulted in cell shrinking within a few minutes. Depending on the medium osmolarity, this was followed by lack of volume recovery for at least 2 h or by slow recovery. Experiments with inhibitors, or with cells in which an aquaporin gene (TcAQP1) was knocked down or overexpressed, revealed its importance for the cellular response to hyperosmotic stress. Furthermore, the adaptation to this new environment was shown to involve the regulation of the polyphosphate polymerization state as well as changes in amino acid catabolism to generate compatible osmolytes. A genome-wide transcriptional analysis of stressed parasites revealed down-regulation of genes belonging to diverse functional categories and up-regulation of genes encoding trans-sialidase-like and ribosomal proteins. Several of these changes were confirmed by Northern blot analyses. Sequence analysis of the 3′UTRs of up- and down-regulated genes allowed the identification of conserved structural RNA motifs enriched in each group, suggesting that specific ribonucleoprotein complexes could be of great importance in the adaptation of this parasite to different environments through regulation of transcript abundance.

The life cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, involves four major developmental stages that alternate between an insect vector and a mammalian host. The parasite enters the mammalian host when the insect vector defecates in the vicinity of the bite, and the natural infective stage, the metacyclic trypomastigote, is carried into the wound by scratching and then penetrates and infects nearby cells. Once inside the host cells, metacyclic trypomastigotes differentiate into amastigotes. These replicative forms multiply in the cytoplasm and, after several rounds of replication, differentiate back into trypomastigotes, which gain access into the bloodstream and eventually invade new cells, thus perpetuating the infection. When the insect bites an infected mammal, the trypomastigotes carried over with the blood meal differentiate into epimastigotes, which are a free replicative form living in the insect intestine. In the rectum, where the insect's urine is discharged, the epimastigotes differentiate to metacyclic trypomastigotes by a process termed metacyclogenesis, and these forms are able to start a new round of infection. T. cruzi has evolved the ability to transit between completely different hosts and to replicate in adverse environments. Inside the vector, after entering the stomach with the blood meal and during their migration through the intestine of the vector, T. cruzi is subjected to dramatic changes in environmental conditions. Of particular importance are the changes in nutrient supply and osmolarity that occur when epimastigotes reach the rectum to undergo metacyclogenesis. There is a very considerable increase in osmolarity in the lower digestive tract of the insect. Osmolarity increases slightly from the feces to the urine, from 320 to 410 mosmol/kg, but there is a very strong increase in the yellow rectal content, up to 1,000 mosmol/kg (1Kollien A.H. Schaub G.A. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 381-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Starvation conditions are also predominant in the rectum, and simulation of these conditions (transfer of epimastigotes into triatomine artificial urine supplemented with amino acids, bicarbonate, and glucose, TAU3AAG) has been used to increase metacyclogenesis in vitro (2Contreras V.T. Salles J.M. Thomas N. Morel C.M. Goldenberg S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Therefore, the parasites are subjected to both nutritional and hyperosmotic stresses at the final stage of their cycle in the vector intestine. Starvation of epimastigotes in PBS in vitro has been shown to result in changes in cell morphology and degradation of the abundant dispersed gene family-1 protein (3Lander N. Bernal C. Diez N. Añez N. Docampo R. Ramírez J.L. Infect. Immun. 2010; 78: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), formation of stress granules (4Cassola A. De Gaudenzi J.G. Frasch A.C. Mol.

Parasitol. 2008; 118: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) has not been studied so far in epimastigotes. Adaptation to hyperosmotic stress has been examined in several cells, although most of what is known is in part due to studies in yeast (12Hohmann S. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 215: 149-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to an elevation in external osmolarity, cells shrink and then regain normal volume by a process called regulatory volume increase. However, this regulatory volume increase response seems not to be a general process; a number of cell types from mammals have been shown not to regain the original volume after hyperosmotic stress, at least within an hour (for review see Ref. 13O'Neill W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C995-C1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High osmolarity has also been shown to elicit global genomic expression responses in yeast (7Gasch A.P. Werner-Washburne M. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2002; 2: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Another form of environmental stress produced by an increase in temperature (heat stress) has been reported to reduce the steady-state levels of most mRNAs in Trypanosoma brucei procyclic stages, although a number of mRNAs were increased (14Kramer S. Queiroz R. Ellis L. Webb H. Hoheisel J.D. Clayton C. Carrington M. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3002-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this study, we report biochemical and global gene expression changes occurring in epimastigotes under hyperosmotic stress. Our results suggest that epimastigotes are able to cope with elevated osmolarities by regulating polyphosphate (polyP) 6The abbreviations used are: polyPpolyphosphatentnucleotide. polymerization state and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, microarray analysis suggests that there is an extensive regulation of mRNA abundance associated with exposure of epimastigotes to different environments. polyphosphate nucleotide. T. cruzi epimastigotes (CL Brener and Y strains) were grown at 28 °C in liver infusion tryptose medium (15Bone G.J. Steinert M. Nature. 1956; 178: 308-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. The epimastigotes transformed with pTEX-TcAQP-GFP constructs (16Montalvetti A. Rohloff P. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38673-38682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) were maintained in liver infusion tryptose medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 0.1–1 mg/ml geneticin (G418). Fetal bovine serum, newborn calf serum, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), paraformaldehyde, bovine serum albumin, and TRI Reagent® were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and goat serum were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). pCR2.1-TOPO cloning kit, superscript reverse transcriptase, 1 kb plus DNA ladder, and 5–6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester were from Invitrogen. RQ1 RNase-free DNase I was from Promega. RNeasy kit was from Qiagen (Germantown, MD). Hybond-N nylon membrane and [32P]dCTP (3,000 mCi/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Taq polymerase was purchased from Denville Scientific Inc. (Metuchen, NJ). All other reagents were analytical grade. The oligonucleotides were ordered from Sigma or Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The oligonucleotides used in this study and their target genes are listed in supplemental Table S1. A recombinant PCR approach was used to generate the knock-out cassettes. The 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences of the TcAQP1 gene were amplified by PCR. The open reading frames (ORFs) of the neomycin- and hygromycin-resistant genes were also amplified by PCR using primers containing ∼20 extra nucleotides at the 5′ end overlapping with the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences of TcAQP1, respectively. The three PCR fragments (5′-TcAQP1 flanking sequence, hygromycin- or neomycin-resistant genes, and the 3′-TcAQP1 flanking sequence) were linked together by sequential PCR. The drug resistance genes were therefore flanked with the exact 5′ and 3′UTR of TcAQP1. The final PCR products were cloned into pCR 2.1 Topo vector. Several clones were sequenced to confirm that the drug resistance gene ORF was correct. The EcoRI-linearized fragments with the drug-resistant gene cassette was then used to transfect Y strain epimastigotes. After obtaining drug-resistant parasites, the genomic DNA was extracted for PCR and Southern blot analysis. Cells were washed and resuspended in isosmotic buffer (20 mm Hepes, 137 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4 and 11 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH, and to an osmolarity of 300 ± 5 mosm, as determined using an Advanced Instruments 3D3 osmometer). Hyposmotic stress was induced by dilution of the isosmotic cell suspension with deionized water to a final osmolarity of 150 mosm at time 0. Hyperosmotic stress was induced by dilution of the cells suspended as above with a 1,000 or 1,300 mosm sorbitol solution (final osmolarity: 650 or 800 mosm, respectively). Relative changes in cell volume were followed monitoring absorbance at 550 nm in a plate reader with continuous agitation. To eliminate changes in absorbance due to decantation of the parasites, readings were normalized against changes in isosmotic buffer. Isosmotic control experiments consisted of dilution of cell suspensions with appropriate volumes of isosmotic buffer. Alternatively, epimastigotes (1 × 108 cells/ml) were loaded with 50 μg/ml 5–6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate for 1 h to obtain uniform cytosolic fluorescence and then treated as described above. Relative changes in volume were followed by monitoring fluorescence (excitation, 491 nm; emission, 530 nm). At the end of each experiment, cells were lysed using 0.1% Triton X-100, and total fluorescence was recorded. Fluorescence was normalized by dividing the fluorescence at each time point by the total fluorescence after detergent addition. Following the induction of hyposmotic or hyperosmotic stress, membrane integrity was determined by ethidium bromide exclusion (17Ruben L. Akins C.D. Haghighat N.G. Xue L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of cells were placed in isosmotic buffer containing 50 μm ethidium bromide and hyposmotic or hyperosmotic stress was induced as described above. Ethidium bromide fluorescence was monitored (excitation, 365 nm; emission, 580 nm) during 2 h in a plate reader (Molecular Devices). For total RNA, a 1-ml aliquot was taken at different times, and RNA was extracted with TRI Reagent®. Total RNA was determined by spectrophotometry. Proteins were measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce). Extractions of long-chain and short-chain polyP and polyP measurements were performed as described before (18Fang J. Rohloff P. Miranda K. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in isosmotic buffer or submitted to hyperosmotic stress at a final concentration of ∼1 × 108 cells/ml. At various time points, 50-μl aliquots were withdrawn, and the cell suspensions were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g. Total amino acid content of resulting supernatants was assayed using the fluorescamine micromethod. To determine total intracellular amino acid content, the resulting cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 m perchloric acid and extracted for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge during 10 min at 4 °C, the resulting cell-free extracts were neutralized with 5 m KOH. Precipitated KClO4 was removed by centrifugation, and the extracts were used for amino acid determination using the fluorescamine micromethod. For the fluorescamine micromethod, 50 μl of sample (supernatants or cell-free extracts) were mixed in a 96-well plate with 150 μl of 0.2 m sodium borate, pH 8.5, and 25 μl of 0.3 mg/ml fluorescamine (dissolved in acetone). Plates were shaken for 1 min, and then the fluorescence was recorded (λ excitation = 390 nm and λ emission = 465 nm). To correlate the fluorescence intensity of the reaction product with the amino acid concentration, a standard curve was prepared using 0–50 nmol of histidine. Cells were incubated in isosmotic buffer or submitted to hyperosmotic stress at a final concentration of ∼1 × 109 cells/ml. At various time points, aliquots of 110 μl were withdrawn and centrifuged for 5 min at 4,500 × g. Pellets were resuspended in 0.6 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, frozen overnight, and then boiled for 5 min. Supernatants (110 μl) were frozen overnight. Ammonium concentrations were determined as follows using an adaptation of a method described previously (10Rohloff P. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 150: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Six hundred microliters of sample (pellets, 500 μl of sample + 100 μl of water; supernatants, 110 μl of sample + 490 μl of water) were used for the ammonium determination. Three hundred microliters of sample was mixed with 36 μl of phenol solution and then vortexed. Thirty six microliters of sodium nitroprusside solution were then added, and the mixture was vortexed again. Finally, 90 μl of oxidizing solution were added, and the was mixture vortexed one final time. Samples were placed in the dark for 1 h and then 200 μl were transferred to a microtiter plate, and absorbance was recorded at 630 nm. To correlate the absorbance of the reaction product with the ammonium concentration, a standard curve was obtained using 0–0.004 μg of NH4Cl. The order of reagent addition, vortexing after each addition, and incubation in the dark were all essential for proper functioning of the assay. Phenol solution was made by adding 1 part 90% liquid phenol to 9 parts 95% ethanol. Sodium nitroprusside solution consisted of 5 mg/ml recrystallized sodium nitroprusside in distilled H2O (reagent-grade sodium nitroprusside was recrystallized by dissolving 10 g in 10 ml of distilled H2O and then adding 20 ml of 95% ethanol and freezing overnight; the resulting crystals were washed with ice-cold 95% ethanol and dried by vacuum filtration). Phenol solution and sodium nitroprusside solution were stable when protected from light and stored at 4 °C. Oxidizing solution (4 parts 20% (w/v) sodium citrate, 1% (w/v) NaOH solution, and 1 part 5% NaOCl) was freshly prepared before each experiment. About 1 × 108 epimastigotes were harvested and washed twice with cold PBS. The parasites were fixed with freshly prepared 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, on ice for 1 h and then embedded in epoxy resin, sectioned, and stained using standard methods. Images were acquired on a Phillips CM-200 transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV. The T. cruzi microarrays were obtained from the Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center. The microarray description is available at J. Craig Venter Institute web site. Epimastigotes in the exponential phase of growth in liver infusion tryptose medium were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with isosmotic buffer, resuspended in the same buffer, and incubated in the same buffer or mixed with sorbitol solution to reach a final osmolarity of 800 ± 5 mosm, as verified with an Advanced Instruments 3D3 osmometer (Norwood, MA). Cells were collected at time 0 or after 3, 6 and 20 h of incubation. At least three biological replicates of all hybridizations were performed. This is to account for sample heterogeneity, variations due to hybridizations, and variation between slides. To prevent bias by preferential label incorporation into particular sequences, dyes were swapped between the two cDNA probes each time. Each slide used has two spots corresponding to each gene, and we used at least six slides for each time point. We therefore had at least 12 spots for each gene at each time point. For each individual time point, S.D. and p values were calculated using the MultiExperiment View Program from the TM4 suite. We include the p values for the most abundantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes. We strictly followed Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center protocol for all steps of the microarray experiments. Total RNA was isolated from different samples of T. cruzi using TRI Reagent® following the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted total RNAs were further treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C to remove genomic DNA contamination. The purified total RNAs were then cleaned up by RNeasy kit. We strictly followed the TIGR protocol to synthesize cDNA probes for hybridization. Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA were mixed with 2 μl of random hexamers (3 mg/ml) and 1 μl of RNaseOUT in diethyl pyrocarbonate water (final volume 18.5 μl) and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. The samples were then snap-frozen on wet ice for 30 s, centrifuged briefly at 10,000 × g, and then mixed with 6 μl of 5× First Strand buffer, 3 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.6 μl of 25 mm dNTP/aa-UTP labeling mix, and 2 μl of Superscript II RT. After mixing, the samples were incubated in a 42 °C water bath overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 10 μl of NaOH and incubated at 65 °C for 15 min to hydrolyze RNA. The solution was brought to neutrality by adding 25 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The unincorporated amino acid-dUTP was removed using a MiniElute column. The purified cDNA was then labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 dye at room temperature for at least 1 h. The uncoupled Cy dye was also removed by the MiniElute column. Slides were prehybridized in 50 ml of prehybridization buffer (5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA) at 42 °C for at least 1 h. The slides were then washed with MilliQ water extensively. The slides were dried by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min. Equal amounts of Cy3 cDNA and Cy5 cDNA were mixed and vacuum-dried. The probes were then resuspended in 50 μl of hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6 μg/μl salmon sperm DNA). The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min, vortexed, and heated again at 95 °C for another 5 min. The hybridization solution was then applied to the pre-hybridized slides. The slides were sealed in a hybridization chamber and hybridized at 42 °C overnight. The slides were then washed in pre-heat low stringency buffer (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 55 °C for 5 min twice and then transferred to medium stringency buffer (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) to wash at room temperature for 5 min twice. The slides were then washed in high stringency buffer (0.1× SSC) twice before drying after centrifuging. The slides were scanned by using ProScanArray microarray scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The data analyses were performed as described previously (19Minning T.A. Weatherly D.B. Atwood 3rd, J. Orlando R. Tarleton R.L. BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 370Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) by using TM4 microarray software suite. We used the Gingko program (Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center website) instead of the Microarray Data Analysis System module to filter and normalize the spots identified by Spot Finder module of TM4. For the Northern blot analysis, total RNA was isolated from epimastigotes using TRI Reagent®. RNA samples were subjected to electrophoreses in 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, 20 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 8 mm sodium acetate, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with radiolabeled probes. All probes used in this study were generated by PCR (supplemental Table S1). The PCRs were performed in a PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA) at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min/cycle (25 cycles) using Taq DNA polymerase. DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random hexanucleotide primers and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Prime-a-Gene labeling system). The rRNA gene was used as a loading control assuming a similar level of expression of this gene under all conditions (20Skeiky Y.A. Benson D.R. Parsons M. Elkon K.B. Reed S.G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The results of Northern blots were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Trypanosome database (T. cruzi CL Brener Genomic Sequence Release 5.1) utilized in this work was obtained from TcruziDB server. 5′ upstream genomic sequences and 3′ downstream genomic sequences were obtained using TcruziDB sequence retrieval tool. A length of 50 nt upstream to the coding sequences was used to obtain sequences resembling the 5′UTR, and 350 nt downstream to the coding sequences were used for 3′UTR, in agreement with previously reported data from trypanosomes (21Benz C. Nilsson D. Andersson B. Clayton C. Guilbride D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 143: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Brandão A. Jiang T. Parasitol. Int. 2009; 58: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 23Campos P.C. Bartholomeu D.C. DaRocha W.D. Cerqueira G.C. Teixeira S.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2008; 38: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Programs used to carry out computational analysis were free internet downloads and compiled in the LINUX environment (Ubuntu 9.10 distribution). Consensus motifs were predicted from each of the 3′UTR groups (up- or down-regulated genes at 3, 6, and 20 h and constantly regulated during all time courses) using Infernal (24Nawrocki E.P. Kolbe D.L. Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 1335-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Candidate motifs obtained were used to build the stochastic context-free grammar model. The stochastic context-free grammar model for each candidate motif was used to search against different datasets to obtain the number of hits for each motif (CMSEARCH program). The motif with the highest enrichment in the specific dataset over the literature database was considered to be the best candidate motif. The motif logo was constructed using WebLogo 2.8.2. Finally, RNAfold server (25Hofacker I.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3429-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar) was used to plot the secondary structure of the representative RNA motifs. DAVID Functional Annotation Chart tool (26Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Tan Q. Collins J.R. Alvord W.G. Roayaei J. Stephens R. Baseler M.W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar) was used to categorize and compare the differently regulated microarray gene list against a T. cruzi background (using Fisher's exact test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction). Hierarchical clustering was carried out using R software. When epimastigotes were subjected to hyperosmotic stress (from 300 to 800 mosm by addition of sorbitol) and then observed microscopically, they shrank dramatically within a few minutes. In contrast to what has been described for the hyposmotic stress (9Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the parasites seem not to regain their normal volume at least during the following 2 h (data not shown). However, they adapted perfectly well to these conditions because they are indistinguishable, in terms of motility, from control cells maintained in isosmotic buffer (data not shown). These initial observations were confirmed by light-scattering experiments. Because cell shrinking leads to an increase in their absorbance (9Rohloff P. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we were able to follow the process by monitoring the absorbance of cell suspensions at 550 nm (Fig. 1A). The progression of shrinking is extremely rapid, being maximal in a few seconds after the shock, and persistent for the whole experimental period of observation (up to 2 h, data not shown). To ensure that other light-scattering artifacts not related to volume changes did not contribute to the observed signal, we also monitored cell volume changes using a fluorescent method. The fluorophore used was an ester form of 5–6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester, which is membrane-permeable but with low fluorescence until it is cleaved intracellularly by nonspecific esterases to produce the impermeable fluorescent form (27Soveral G. Madeira A. Loureiro-Dias M.C. Moura T.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 2341-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As the cell shrinks or swells in response to osmotic changes, the concentration of the entrapped fluorophore will rise or fall with a consequent change in fluorescence output; the concentration-dependent self-quenching properties of the fluorophore enable cell volume changes to be recorded as changes in fluorescence. We observed again that shrinking occurs almost immediately after treatment without any evidence of significant volume recovery (Fig. 1B, bottom curve). As a control, hyposmotic stress was also induced, showing that the process of volume recovery is extremely rapid and is essentially complete by 6 min (Fig. 1B, upper curve). We confirmed that the plasma membrane remained intact during the hyperosmotic stress by performing the same experiment in the presence of extracellular ethidium bromide (EtBr). Because EtBr exhibits a fluorescence enhancement upon binding DNA, a compromise in membrane integrity would result in increased fluorescence (17Ruben L. Akins C.D. Haghighat N.G. Xue L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). No significant increase in EtBr fluorescence could be observed during the induction of hyperosmotic stress (Fig. 1C). When epimastigotes were incubated at lower osmolarities (</= 650 mosm) a slight drop of absorbance was detected after a long incubation period, suggesting partial recovery of their volume (see Figs. 2A and 3E). However, the recovery was not significant, and the slight decrease in absorbance could be attributed to shape changes under stress conditions.FIGURE 2Role of TcAQP1 in changes in epimastigote volume after hyperosmotic stress. A, epimastigotes were suspended in hyperosmotic buffer (final osmolarity = 650 mosm), and changes in cell volume were followed by monitoring absorbance at 550 nm in the absence (solid line) or presence of 1 (dotted l"
https://openalex.org/W1994059319,"Tumor cell invasion is vital for cancer progression and metastasis. Adhesion, migration, and degradation of the extracellular matrix are important events involved in the establishment of cancer cells at a new site, and therefore molecular targets are sought to inhibit such processes. The effect of a plant proteinase inhibitor, Enterolobium contortisiliquum trypsin inhibitor (EcTI), on the adhesion, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells was the focus of this study. EcTI showed no effect on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells or fibroblasts but inhibited the adhesion, migration, and cell invasion of gastric cancer cells; however, EcTI had no effect upon the adhesion of fibroblasts. EcTI was shown to decrease the expression and disrupt the cellular organization of molecules involved in the formation and maturation of invadopodia, such as integrin β1, cortactin, neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, membrane type 1 metalloprotease, and metalloproteinase-2. Moreover, gastric cancer cells treated with EcTI presented a significant decrease in intracellular phosphorylated Src and focal adhesion kinase, integrin-dependent cell signaling components. Together, these results indicate that EcTI inhibits the invasion of gastric cancer cells through alterations in integrin-dependent cell signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2012745359,"The renal collecting duct adapts to changes in acid-base metabolism by remodelling and altering the relative number of acid or alkali secreting cells, a phenomenon termed plasticity. Acid secretory A intercalated cells (A-IC) express apical H+-ATPases and basolateral bicarbonate exchanger AE1 whereas bicarbonate secretory B intercalated cells (B-IC) express basolateral (and apical) H+-ATPases and the apical bicarbonate exchanger pendrin. Intercalated cells were thought to be terminally differentiated and unable to proliferate. However, a recent report in mouse kidney suggested that intercalated cells may proliferate and that this process is in part dependent on GDF-15. Here we extend these observations to rat kidney and provide a detailed analysis of regional differences and demonstrate that differentiated A-IC proliferate massively during adaptation to systemic acidosis. We used markers of proliferation (PCNA, Ki67, BrdU incorporation) and cell-specific markers for A-IC (AE1) and B-IC (pendrin). Induction of remodelling in rats with metabolic acidosis (with NH4Cl for 12 hrs, 4 and 7 days) or treatment with acetazolamide for 10 days resulted in a larger fraction of AE1 positive cells in the cortical collecting duct. A large number of AE1 expressing A-IC was labelled with proliferative markers in the cortical and outer medullary collecting duct whereas no labeling was found in B-IC. In addition, chronic acidosis also increased the rate of proliferation of principal collecting duct cells. The fact that both NH4Cl as well as acetazolamide stimulated proliferation suggests that systemic but not urinary pH triggers this response. Thus, during chronic acidosis proliferation of AE1 containing acid-secretory cells occurs and may contribute to the remodelling of the collecting duct or replace A-IC due to a shortened life span under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2123398789,"Sabre-like canines clearly have the potential to inflict grievous wounds leading to massive blood loss and rapid death. Hypotheses concerning sabretooth killing modes include attack to soft parts such as the belly or throat, where biting deep is essential to generate strikes reaching major blood vessels. Sabretoothed carnivorans are widely interpreted as hunters of larger and more powerful prey than that of their present-day nonsabretoothed relatives. However, the precise functional advantage of the sabretooth bite, particularly in relation to prey size, is unknown. Here, we present a new point-to-point bite model and show that, for sabretooths, depth of the killing bite decreases dramatically with increasing prey size. The extended gape of sabretooths only results in considerable increase in bite depth when biting into prey with a radius of less than ∼10 cm. For sabretooths, this size-reversed functional advantage suggests predation on species within a similar size range to those attacked by present-day carnivorans, rather than ""megaherbivores"" as previously believed. The development of the sabretooth condition appears to represent a shift in function and killing behaviour, rather than one in predator-prey relations. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how sabretoothed carnivorans are likely to have evolved along a functionally continuous trajectory: beginning as an extension of a jaw-powered killing bite, as adopted by present-day pantherine cats, followed by neck-powered biting and thereafter shifting to neck-powered shear-biting. We anticipate this new insight to be a starting point for detailed study of the evolution of pathways that encompass extreme specialisation, for example, understanding how neck-powered biting shifts into shear-biting and its significance for predator-prey interactions. We also expect that our model for point-to-point biting and bite depth estimations will yield new insights into the behaviours of a broad range of extinct predators including therocephalians (gorgonopsian + cynodont, sabretoothed mammal-like reptiles), sauropterygians (marine reptiles) and theropod dinosaurs."
https://openalex.org/W2046241355,"IMPDH and GMPR have similar active sites, but their reactions cause opposite effects on the guanine nucleotide pool. Biochemical and crystallographic evidence point to cofactor conformation as distinguishing the two reaction mechanisms and demonstrate that GMPR can substitute for IMPDH, prompting further investigations of this metabolic cycle. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and guanosine monophosphate reductase (GMPR) belong to the same structural family, share a common set of catalytic residues and bind the same ligands. The structural and mechanistic features that determine reaction outcome in the IMPDH and GMPR family have not been identified. Here we show that the GMPR reaction uses the same intermediate E-XMP* as IMPDH, but in this reaction the intermediate reacts with ammonia instead of water. A single crystal structure of human GMPR type 2 with IMP and NADPH fortuitously captures three different states, each of which mimics a distinct step in the catalytic cycle of GMPR. The cofactor is found in two conformations: an 'in' conformation poised for hydride transfer and an 'out' conformation in which the cofactor is 6 Å from IMP. Mutagenesis along with substrate and cofactor analog experiments demonstrate that the out conformation is required for the deamination of GMP. Remarkably, the cofactor is part of the catalytic machinery that activates ammonia."
https://openalex.org/W2094557014,"Recently, we discovered a novel non-angiotensin type 1 (non-AT1), non-AT2 angiotensin binding site in rodent and human brain membranes, which is distinctly different from angiotensin receptors and key proteases processing angiotensins. It is hypothesized to be a new member of the renin-angiotensin system. This study was designed to isolate and identify this novel angiotensin binding site. An angiotensin analog, photoaffinity probe 125I-SBpa-Ang II, was used to specifically label the non-AT1, non-AT2 angiotensin binding site in mouse forebrain membranes, followed by a two-step purification procedure based on the molecular size and isoelectric point of the photoradiolabeled binding protein. Purified samples were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry identification of proteins in the two-dimensional gel sections containing radioactivity. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed eight protein candidates, of which the four most abundant were immunoprecipitated after photoradiolabeling. Immunoprecipitation studies indicated that the angiotensin binding site might be the membrane-bound variant of metalloendopeptidase neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16). To verify these observations, radioligand binding and photoradiolabeling experiments were conducted in membrane preparations of HEK293 cells overexpressing mouse neurolysin or thimet oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.15), a closely related metalloendopeptidase of the same family. These experiments also identified neurolysin as the non-AT1, non-AT2 angiotensin binding site. Finally, brain membranes of mice lacking neurolysin were nearly devoid of the non-AT1, non-AT2 angiotensin binding site, further establishing membrane-bound neurolysin as the binding site.

J. Hypertens. 1999; 17: 1775-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The system was introduced to the scientific community by the discovery of renin, the main enzyme generating effector peptides of RAS, by Tigerstedt and Bergmann in 1898 (2Tigerstedt R. Bergmann P. Scand. Arch. Physiol. 1898; 8: 223-271Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar). With the discovery of the existence of the two major angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor subtypes (AT1 and AT2) in the late 1980s, most of the questions related to the biochemical, pharmacological, and physiological features of the RAS seemed to be resolved (3de Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon extensive studies of the RAS for over a century, three classes of drugs targeting different levels of the system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (-prils), angiotensin receptor blockers (-sartans), and renin inhibitors (-kirens)) are in worldwide clinical use. However, new discoveries extending fundamental aspects of RAS continue to occur. Among such discoveries are agonistic autoantibodies against angiotensin type 1 receptor (4Wallukat G. Homuth V.

Speth R.C. Brain Res. 2007; 1143: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which was also confirmed in mouse and human brain membranes (16Karamyan V.T. Gembardt F. Rabey F.M. Walther T.

Life Sci. 2008; 83: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The non-AT1, non-AT2 binding site has nanomolar affinity and high specificity for angiotensins I, II, and III and is pharmacologically, biochemically, and anatomically different from classical angiotensin type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptors, G-protein coupled Mas receptor, and neprilysin (EC 3.4.24.11, also known as neutral endopeptidase), a protease involved in the processing of angiotensins (15Karamyan V.T. Speth R.C. Brain Res. 2007; 1143: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Karamyan V.T. Gembardt F. Rabey F.M. Walther T. Speth R.C. Eur. J.

Karamyan V.T. Speth R.C. Regul. Pept. 2010; 162: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Increased expression of the novel binding site was strongly associated with neuronal cell death following oxidative stress (20Rashid M. Arumugam T.V. Karamyan V.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 335: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), whereas it is reduced in spontaneously hypertensive rat brains (21Bourassa E.A. Fang X. Li X. Sved A.F. Speth R.C. Brain Res. 2010; 1359: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the functional significance of these changes and molecular mechanisms of their potential effects. A unique feature of the novel angiotensin binding site is that it is unmasked (i.e. attains high affinity for angiotensins) in the presence of optimal concentrations of organomercurial sulfhydryl reagents p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB) or p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (15Karamyan V.T. Speth R.C. Brain Res. 2007; 1143: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Rashid M. Arumugam T.V. Karamyan V.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 335: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This effect is reversed by glutathione and disulfide-reducing agents, suggesting the involvement of cysteine residues (thiol groups) in unmasking and function of the binding site, with a potential role of extracellular redox state in regulation of the function of this protein (15Karamyan V.T. Speth R.C. Brain Res. 2007; 1143: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Rashid M. Arumugam T.V. Karamyan V.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 335: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The purpose of this study was to identify the non-AT1, non-AT2 angiotensin binding site. Here we report experiments involving photoradiolabeling, stepwise electrophoretic, and mass spectroscopic methods, followed by molecular-genetic and receptor pharmacological approaches used to isolate, characterize, and establish the identity of the binding protein.RESULTSPhotoradiolabeling of the non-AT1, non-AT2 angiotensin binding site with 125I-SBpa-Ang II in mouse forebrain membranes was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis of samples. Specific and reproducible photoradiolabeling of a ∼75-kDa protein was observed, with minor labeling at ∼50 kDa (Fig. 1). As expected, nonspecific (NS) samples, which contained saturating concentrations of Ang II to prevent 125I-SBpa-Ang II binding to the binding site, showed negligible radioactive signal at ∼75 and ∼50 kDa (Fig. 1). Therefore, all experiments were carried out with parallel use and comparison of total and nonspecific samples to avoid tracking of nonspecifically photoradiolabeled protein(s).To obtain sufficient material for purification and identification of the binding protein, multiple preparative SDS-PAGE separations were performed using photoradiolabeled mouse forebrain membranes. Gel slices from the ∼75-kDa region were pooled together from all preparative runs, and proteins were extracted, concentrated, and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2a). The photoradiolabeled protein was reproducibly detected by autoradiography after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2b). To further purify the photoradiolabeled protein, the concentrate of proteins from the 75-kDa regions was subjected to preparative isoelectric focusing on one-dimensional pH 3–10 gradient strips. Next, slices of strips containing the radioactive signal (pH ∼5.5–7.0) were collected and combined. Proteins were extracted and concentrated, followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the sample (Fig. 2c). Upon reproducible detection of the photoradiolabeled protein following the purification steps (Fig. 2d), the region of the two-dimensional gel containing the radioactive signal was cut out and used for identification of proteins by LC-MS/MS analysis.FIGURE 1Photoradiolabeling of the non-AT1, non-AT2 angiotensin binding site in P10 mouse forebrain membranes.

Because all two-dimensional gel excision samples contained radioactive signal (i.e. photoradiolabeled non-AT1, non-AT2 binding site), we expected to see the protein of interest detected in all LC-MS/MS analyses. For this reason, only the proteins repeatedly identified in all five LC-MS/MS runs were shortlisted for further analysis (Table 1). These proteins included neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16, accession number gi%7C28077051), collapsin response mediator protein 2 (accession number gi%7C40254595), thimet oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.15, accession number gi%7C239916005), α-adducin (accession number gi%7C6851286), collapsin response mediator protein 1 (accession number gi%7C74186635), G-protein signaling modulator 1 (accession number gi%7C32189378), long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase (accession number gi%7C16716465), ezrin (accession number gi%7C74179741), and serine protease 1 (accession number gi%7C16716569). Of these nine proteins, serine protease 1 had an estimated molecular mass of 26.8 kDa and was considered unlikely to be the angiotensin-binding protein and consequently excluded from further analysis. The remaining eight protein candidates were ranked using their Mascot “Score” and “Peptide query” (or spectral counts) values. These data indicated consistently higher amounts of neurolysin, thimet oligopeptidase, collapsin response mediator protein 2, and α-adducin in the analyzed samples. Therefore, these proteins were prioritized for investigation to test the candidacy of the non-AT1, non-AT2 binding site (supplemental Fig. 1).TABLE 1Mass spectrometry identification of proteins repeatedly identified in all two-dimensional gel samplesProteinaProteins were as follows: neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16); collapsin response mediator protein 2 (dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2) (CRMP2); thimet oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.15) (Thimet OP); collapsin response mediator protein 1 (CRMP1); G-protein signaling modulator 1 (Gpsm1); long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase (LCFA-CoA-L); ezrin, and serine protease 1.Accession No.Sample 1RankbRank number reflects top Mascot score position in a sample.

Open table in a new tab The results of immunoprecipitation studies using specific antibodies against the top four candidates (neurolysin, thimet oligopeptidase, collapsin response mediator protein 2, and α-adducin) in photoradiolabeled mouse forebrain membranes are summarized in Fig. 3. “Total” samples of immunoprecipitates with anti-neurolysin antibody contained a substantial amount of radioactive signal (Fig. 3a), indicating that the non-AT1, non-AT2 angiotensin binding site is probably neurolysin. Total samples of anti-thimet oligopeptidase immunoprecipitates contained a marginal level of radioactivity, which could be due to cross-reactivity of the anti-thimet oligopeptidase antibody with neurolysin or a small degree of radiophotolabeling of thimet oligopeptidase. Total samples of collapsin response mediator protein 2 and α-adducin showed negligible amounts of radioactive signal. To ensure that the proteins of interest were indeed immunoprecipitated from photoradiolabeled membrane samples, their presence in the immunoprecipitates was documented by Western blotting (Fig. 3, b–e).FIGURE 3Immunoprecipitation of neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16), thimet oligopeptidase (thimet OP; EC 3.4.24.15), α-adducin, and collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) from photoradiolabeled P10 mouse forebrain membrane preparations.

Overexpression of both proteins in HEK293 cells was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4, a and b). Radioligand binding assays in membrane preparations of these cells using 125I-SI-Ang II showed dramatically increased density of the novel angiotensin binding sites only in HEK293 cells overexpressing neurolysin (Bmax = 533 ± 69 fmol/mg protein) compared with non-transfected, empty vector-transfected, and thimet oligopeptidase-overexpressing HEK293 cell membranes (108 ± 25.2, 94.6 ± 20.1, and 90.4 ± 7.9 fmol/mg protein respectively; n = 3) (Fig. 4, c and d). Notably, affinity of the radioligand for the novel binding site did not differ significantly among the four groups (Kd = 3.35 ± 0.41, 2.11 ± 0.57, 1.75 ± 0.42, and 2.53 ± 0.58 nm, respectively). Photoradiolabeling experiments carried out in membrane preparations of the same cells also indicated substantially higher photoradiolabeling of the binding site in cell membranes overexpressing neurolysin compared with thimet oligopeptidase or control groups (Fig. 4, e and f).FIGURE 4Summary of experiments conducted in HEK293 cells.

Absence of neurolysin in the neurolysin KO mouse forebrains was documented by Western blotting (Fig. 5a). Saturable binding of 125I-SI-Ang II to the non-AT1, non-AT2 angiotensin binding site in neurolysin KO forebrain membranes was not statistically significantly different from zero based on 95% confidence interval values (Fig. 5b). In contrast, there was a substantial amount of high affinity, saturable binding of 125I-SI-Ang II (Kd = 1.13 ± 0.21 nm, Bmax = 54.4 ± 12.7 fmol/mg protein, n = 3) in wild-type forebrain membranes (Fig. 5c). Photoradiolabeling experiments in the same membrane preparations confirmed the presence of the expected radioactive signal from WT control samples and the absence of radioactive signal in neurolysin KO forebrain membranes (Fig. 5, d and e). In vitro receptor autoradiography studies in coronal sections of neurolysin KO and WT mouse forebrains also verified these observations, indicating high intensity binding of 125I-SI-Ang II in WT and a paucity of binding in neurolysin KO brains (supplemental Fig. 2).FIGURE 5Summary of experiments conducted in neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16) knock-out and wild-type mice. a, representative Western blot of neurolysin in knock-out (KO#1 and KO#2) and wild-type (WT#1 and WT#2) mouse forebrain membranes. b, representative saturation binding isotherms of specific (10 μm Ang II displaceable) 125I-SI-Ang II binding to the non-AT1, non-AT2 angiotensin binding site in neurolysin KO and WT mouse forebrain membranes (1-h incubation at 24 °C in the presence of 20 μm PD123319, 2 μm ZD7155, and 150 μm PCMB with or without 10 μm Ang II for estimation of the nonspecific binding).

Ang II and/or ZD7155 (AT1 receptor antagonist) and PD123319 (AT2 receptor antagonist) blocked photoradiolabeling of a diffuse band of protein at ∼55–60 kDa by 125I-SBpa-Ang II (supplemental Fig. 3). The presence of AT1 and AT2 receptors in neurolysin KO and WT mouse brains was clearly distinguished by radioligand binding experiments using 125I-SI-Ang II (supplemental Fig. 4).DISCUSSIONThe recently discovered non-AT1, non-AT2 angiotensin binding site in rodent and human brain membranes has distinctly different biochemical properties and tissue distribution from classic angiotensin receptors and key angiotensin-processing enzymes (15Karamyan V.T.

Many features of this protein (high affinity and pharmacological specificity for angiotensins; conservation in brains of numerous species, including humans; localization on the plasma membrane, where it can interact with extracellular ligands; and association of expression of this protein with neuronal cell death and neurogenic hypertension) strongly favor its functional significance (16Karamyan V.T.

However, the unknown identity of the novel angiotensin binding site has limited our understanding of the (patho)physiological function of this hypothesized new member of the RAS.The photoaffinity probe 125I-SBpa-Ang II specifically and covalently photoradiolabeled the non-AT1, non-AT2 angiotensin binding site in mouse forebrain membranes (Fig. 1). The radioactive signal was tracked and purified through electrophoretic procedures based on molecular size and isoelectric point of the binding protein (Fig. 2). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS analysis of the radioactive protein spot revealed eight candidates (Table 1 and supplemental Table 1), of which the four most abundant (neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16), thimet oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.15), collapsin response mediator protein 2, and α-adducin) were immunoprecipitated from photoradiolabeled mouse forebrain membranes. Immunoprecipitates of neurolysin contained substantial radioactive signal, in contrast to negligible radioactivity in the other three protein immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3).Radioligand binding and photoradiolabeling experiments independently showed “gain of phenotype” (i.e. significantly increased density of the angiotensin binding site) in membranes of HEK293 cells overexpressing neurolysin but not thimet oligopeptidase or control groups (Fig. 4).Radioligand binding, photoradiolabeling, and in vitro receptor autoradiography experiments performed in neurolysin KO and WT mouse forebrains revealed a “loss of phenotype” (i.e. loss of high affinity specific binding to the angiotensin binding site) in neurolysin KO animals (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 2), further establ"

To establish an infection of the bladder or kidneys during UTI, ascension of the urinary tract is an essential component of pathogenesis. To ascend, however, bacteria must first resist being expelled by the flushing mechanism of voiding while also engaging in upward motility. To avoid elimination, bacteria use fimbriae, cell surface appendages carrying adhesins, to bind to glycolipid or glycoprotein receptors expressed on the surface of uroepithelial cells, to immobilize themselves along the walls of the urinary tract. Although UPEC strains can encode more than 10 different types of fimbriae, certain fimbriae have been identified as critical to the development of a UTI. For example, mutations in genes encoding Type 1 fimbriae greatly reduce the ability of UPEC to cause UTI in a murine model of infection (4Connell I. Agace W. Klemm P. Schembri M. Mrild S. Svanborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 9827-9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). P fimbria, encoded by the pap (pyelonephritis-associated pili) operon (5Johnson J.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 80-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), binds to Galα(1–4)βGal moieties of P blood group antigen, a glycosphingolipid, present on the surface of kidney epithelial cells of most humans (6Leffler H. Svanborg-Edén C. Infect. Immun. 1981; 34: 920-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lund B. Lindberg F. Marklund B.I. Normark S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 5898-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In epidemiological studies, the presence of P fimbria is strongly associated with UPEC strains in general and development of upper UTI in humans in particular (8Korhonen T.K. Väisänen V. Saxén H. Hultberg H. Svenson S.B. Infect. Immun. 1982; 37: 286-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mulholland S.G. Mooreville M. Parsons C.L. Urology. 1984; 24: 232-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), although the importance of P fimbriae in a murine model of infection has not been firmly established (10Mobley H.L. Jarvis K.G. Elwood J.P. Whittle D.I. Lockatell C.V. Russell R.G. Johnson D.E. Donnenberg M.S. Warren J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To ascend, UPEC relies on flagella, organelles that mediate motility. Flagellar expression is controlled by the master regulators of motility, flhD and flhC, whose gene products together regulate the first step of a tiered regulatory cascade that results in the production of flagella (reviewed in Ref. 11Smith T.G. Hoover T.R. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 2009; 67: 257-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and references therein). Flagella clearly also contribute to virulence of UPEC in a murine model of UTI (12Lane M.C. Lockatell V. Monterosso G. Lamphier D. Weinert J. Hebel J.R. Johnson D.E. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7644-7656Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and are important in bacterial ascension via the ureters from the bladder to the kidneys (12Lane M.C. Lockatell V. Monterosso G. Lamphier D. Weinert J. Hebel J.R. Johnson D.E. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7644-7656Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 13Schwan W.R. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2008; 298: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Motility, mediated by flagella, and adherence, mediated by fimbriae, are inherently antagonistic forces when simultaneously expressed. The immobilizing effect of fimbriae would limit the motility of flagella, and increased motility by flagella would reduce the ability of bacteria to adhere at one site, yet both motility and adherence contribute significantly to the development of UTI. Thus, it is logical that bacteria would have in place a mechanism to reciprocally control motility and adherence. It has been shown previously in Proteus mirabilis, a UPEC-related Gram-negative enteric bacterium also capable of causing UTI, that MrpJ, a protein encoded by the MR/P fimbrial operon, inhibits both swarming and swimming motility (14Pearson M.M. Mobley H.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 548-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In UPEC, flagella are coordinately expressed during urinary tract infection (15Lane M.C. Alteri C.J. Smith S.N. Mobley H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 16669-16674Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Recent studies in UPEC have demonstrated that PapX, a non-structural 183-amino acid protein of the highly conserved 17-kDa family and a functional homolog of MrpJ, which is encoded by the PAI-CFT073pheV but not PAI-CFT073pheU-associated pap operon, down-regulates motility by repressing the expression of flagella (16Simms A.N. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The presumed mechanism of repression is the direct binding to the flhDC promoter, the master regulator of flagellar synthesis (17Soutourina O.A. Bertin P.N. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 505-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism of repression and structure-function relationships within PapX are unknown. To further our understanding of the mechanism of PapX-mediated repression of motility, we functionally characterized the PapX protein and used systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) in conjunction with high throughput sequencing technology to identify a novel DNA binding site for PapX within the flhDC promoter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of the use of SELEX in conjunction with high throughput sequencing technology in bacteria to study DNA-binding proteins and the first time these techniques have been used to identify a novel binding site instead of to confirm or refine known binding sites. Our application of SELEX with high throughput sequencing provides for novel advantages over previous techniques for identifying bacterial transcription factor binding sites and may serve as the paradigm for future high throughput screens. Because the 17-kDa family of genes is highly conserved, by elucidating the mechanisms underlying reciprocal control of motility by PapX in UPEC, we will be better equipped to manipulate and disrupt this important regulatory cascade and virulence property of a pathogenic microbe. For bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study, see supplemental Table 1. E. coli CFT073, a fully sequenced (18Welch R.A. Burland V. Plunkett 3rd, G. Redford P. Roesch P. Rasko D. Buckles E.L. Liou S.R. Boutin A. Hackett J. Stroud D. Mayhew G.F. Rose D.J. Zhou S. Schwartz D.C. Perna N.T. Mobley H.L. Donnenberg M.S. Blattner F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 17020-17024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar) strain of UPEC, was cultured from the blood and urine of a hospitalized patient with acute pyelonephritis and urosepsis (19Mobley H.L. Green D.M. Trifillis A.L. Johnson D.E. Chippendale G.R. Lockatell C.V. Jones B.D. Warren J.W. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) was used for overexpression of PapX-His6. All E. coli strains were cultured overnight at 37 °C in Luria broth with aeration or on Luria agar plates containing either ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml), kanamycin (25 μg/ml), or no antibiotic. For Western blots, PapX was expressed from the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible plasmid pPxWT in E. coli K12 strain MG1655 in the presence or absence of 300 μm IPTG. Growth curves were generated in triplicate using a Microbiology Reader Bioscreen C (Oy Growth Curves AB, Ltd.) in 0.2-ml volumes; A600 was recorded every 15 min for 24 h. Flagellum-mediated motility was measured as described previously (16Simms A.N. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, soft Luria agar (0.25% (w/v)) plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) were stabbed in the center using an inoculating needle with either Luria broth cultures normalized to A600 = 0.9–1.0 or colonies struck onto plates the day prior. Care was taken not to touch the bottom of the plate during inoculation to ensure that only swimming motility was assessed. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 16 h, and swimming diameter was measured. Results were analyzed using a paired t test. Nested deletions of the flhDC promoter were fused to lacZ using a promoterless lacZ-containing plasmid, pRS551, using a previously described methodology (20Clarke M.B. Sperandio V. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 1734-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, primers containing flanking BamHI or EcoRI overhangs were designed to amplify DNA fragments that were 130, 215, 360, 501, 597, and 718 bp upstream of the translational start site of flhD of E. coli CFT073 (supplemental Table 2). Fragments and the pRS551 vector were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated to form constructs pRS551A to pRS551F (supplemental Table 1). Electrocompetent E. coli DH5α was electroporated with pRS551A to pRS551F, incubated for 1 h in 500–800 μl of Super Optimal broth with catabolite repression (SOC), and plated onto Luria agar plates containing kanamycin (25 μg/ml). Plasmids were extracted from KanR colonies using a Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced to confirm the proper fusion constructs. Plasmid constructs were transformed into E. coli CFT073 ΔpapXΔlacZ (CamR) or E. coli CFT073 ΔlacZ (CamR). β-Galactosidase activities of the constructs were measured using the modified Miller assay as described (21Zhang X. Bremer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11181-11189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Briefly, overnight cultures of each construct were diluted 1:100 in LB broth and incubated at 37 °C with aeration. A600 was measured after 2.5 h, and samples (5 μl) were added to 95 μl of 100 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.8 mg/ml cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 0.4 mg/ml sodium deoxycholate, 5.4 μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol to lyse bacterial cells. Lysates (100 μl) were mixed with 600 μl of 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mg/ml ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside, 2.7 μl/ml β-mercaptoethanol reaction buffer and incubated at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped after 5–25 min with 700 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate. Bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 23 °C), and A420 of the supernatant was measured. Miller units were computed using the formula, 1000 × (A420)/(A600 × 0.05 × time in min). Results were compared using a paired t test. Deletion mutants were constructed using the λ-red recombinase system (22Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11133) Google Scholar). Briefly, flanking homologous primers were designed (supplemental Table 2) and used to generate amplicons from plasmid pKD3 or pKD4 to generate kanamycin or chloramphenicol resistance cassettes. Amplicons were treated with DpnI for 3 h at 37 °C to remove parental DNA and transformed into electrocompetent CFT073 bacteria expressing pKD46 induced in 10 mm (final concentration) arabinose. Resistance cassettes were removed by transforming resultant constructs with pCP20 and leaving cultures to incubate at 37 °C overnight. Site-directed mutants were constructed in pPxWT using the QuikChange II kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, overlapping primers were designed to contain nucleotide substitutions and used for rolling PCR of pPxWT. PCR products were treated for 3 h with DpnI at 37 °C to remove parental DNA. Amplicons were transformed into electrocompetent CFT073 and recovered for 1 h in 500–800 μl of SOC, and then 200 μl was plated onto LB agar containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Resistant colonies were cultured overnight in LB broth at 37 °C, and plasmid DNA was extracted and sequenced as described above. Nucleotides encoding amino acids 13–183 of PapX were cloned into pMCSG7 in front of a His6-TEV cleavage site by ligation-independent cloning. pMCSG7 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Bacteria were cultured in 500 ml of terrific broth in a 2-liter flask at 250 rpm at 37 °C to A600 ≅ 1.0 and then cooled to room temperature for 1 h. Bacteria were induced overnight with 300 μm IPTG. After induction, cells were centrifuged (13,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and pellets were frozen at −80 °C. Frozen pellets were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 300 mm NaCl and ruptured by sonication using a blunt tip probe for seven cycles of 60% maximum energy for 30-s bursts with 1-min intervals to cool (GENEQ, 500-watt ultrasonic processor). The lysate was centrifuged (112,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), and the supernatant was passed through a 0.22-μm pore size filter (MillexGP, Millipore) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 5–10 ml of Ni2+-NTA resin (Invitrogen). Resin was washed three times in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 300 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole. Protein was concentrated to 2 mg/ml, and 50-μl aliquots were frozen at −80 °C. The presence of PapX was confirmed as the predominant species on a 12% acrylamide gel. Bands were analyzed using tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) by the Michigan State University Proteomics Core Facility. Gel shift assays were performed as described (16Simms A.N. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Recombinant PapX-His6, expressed from pMCGS7, was purified as described above and used for gel shift assays. The DNA fragment used was the −345 through −501 bp region upstream of the flhD translational start site in E. coli CFT073. Poly(dI-dC) and poly-l-lysine were substituted with tris-EDTA-sodium (TEN) buffer in the binding reaction. Competition was performed using four unlabeled fragments. Three fragments (TTACGGTGAGTTATTTTAACTGTGCGCAA, TTACGGTGAGTTATTTTAAC, and GTTATTTTAAC) were derived from the predicted PapX binding site from SELEX (see “Results”). The fourth fragment (ACTCCACTCACGGCCGTTTCGACGGTACCG) was derived from the gapA promoter, which has previously been demonstrated not to shift in the presence of PapX (16Simms A.N. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A library of 80–100-bp sequences was generated from CFT073 genomic DNA and paired end-ligated as described (23Kozarewa I. Ning Z. Quail M.A. Sanders M.J. Berriman M. Turner D.J. Nat. Methods. 2009; 6: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) at the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core. PapX-His6 was purified as described above; however, before eluting bound protein, 200-μl samples of the resin were incubated with gentle agitation for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 150 ng of library DNA. The resin was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole to remove unbound library fragments, and bound DNA-PapX complexes were eluted using the same buffer but containing 500 mm imidazole. DNA was isolated from the eluted complexes by two phenol/chloroform extractions. DNA was subjected to 12–15 rounds of PCR using primers specific to the ligated paired ends to ensure that no contaminating DNA was amplified. Libraries were quantified using quantitative PCR. The resultant library (150 ng) was run again over a fresh 200-μl sample of PapX-His6 bound to Ni2+-NTA resin, and the process was repeated four times. The unselected library, as well as enriched rounds two, three, and four, were sequenced using Illumina high throughput sequencing. A local BLAST comparison to the CFT073 genome was done for each short read per run, and the number of reads at each chromosomal position in CFT073 was recorded. Matlab (Student version 7.12.0) was used to identify peaks that had enriched competitively throughout the cycles of amplification to identify relevant peaks. 60-bp regions, centered on each relevant peak, were analyzed using the MEME suite (24Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar) to generate the most likely motifs. PHYRE (version 0.2) (25Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3553) Google Scholar) and I-TASSER (version 1.1) (26Roy A. Kucukural A. Zhang Y. Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4669) Google Scholar, 27Zhang Y. Proteins. 2007; 69: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) were employed to predict the most likely structure of the PapX protein. The model predicted by I-TASSER was rendered using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (version 1.3, Schrödinger, LLC). Recombinant purified PapX-His6 was also analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) and seminative gel electrophoresis in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Antiserum to PapX was commercially generated in rabbits using a polyclonal antibody fast production protocol (Rockland Immunochemicals Custom Antibody Services) from a single-protein peak eluted from a Sephacryl S-200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) of nickel affinity-purified recombinant PapX-His6. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed as described (16Simms A.N. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA, extracted from 200 μl of bacterial culture, was reverse-transcribed to generate cDNA and analyzed using SYBR Green and primers for 100-bp fragments of genes of interest (supplemental Table 2). gapA was used as a normalizer for all conditions. Primers, end-labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein, were used to generate fluorescent probes from the first 130-, 215-, 360-, and 500-bp fragments of the flhDC promoter as well as a 300-bp fragment of the gapA promoter. Fragments were incubated with purified recombinant PapX-His6 and exposed to low levels of DNase I for 1–10 min. Sheared fragments were processed by electrophoresis (as for DNA sequencing) to produce chromatograms representing all sheared fragments and examined for stretches of troughs between peaks. Multiplex PCR was performed using methods and a 294-member subset of a 315-member strain collection as described (28Vigil P.D. Stapleton A.E. Johnson J.R. Hooton T.M. Hodges A.P. He Y. Mobley H.L. MBio. 2011; 2: e00011-e00066Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Spurbeck R.R. Stapleton A.E. Johnson J.R. Walk S.T. Hooton T.M. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2011; 79: 4753-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Primers were designed to unique flanking sequences of papX and focX and common regions of both (supplemental Table 2). Non-reducing/seminative gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (30Hagan E.C. Mobley H.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 71: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein was isolated as described above. SDS-PAGE loading buffer lacking dithiothreitol was added to samples, which were electrophoresed in the presence of 0.1% SDS on a 12% acrylamide gel (3.75% stacking gel) at 200 V for 1 h at room temperature. Gels were stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 dissolved in a buffer composed of 10% acetic acid, 40% methanol, and 50% water. Gels were destained in a buffer composed of 10% acetic acid, 40% methanol, and 50% water. To assess the distribution and conservation of PapX, we compared the amino acid sequence of PapX homologs using ClustalW. PapX has six closely related homologs of the 17-kDa protein family among strains of UPEC and meningitis-associated E. coli, with over 93% amino acid identity between them (Fig. 1). Three of the 10 non-identical residues are substitutions between Ala and Val or Ile and Val. Four non-identical sites contain either Ala or Thr. These features result in pairs of PapX homologs sharing up to 99% amino acid sequence identity. To assess the prevalence of papX in UPEC strains, a collection of 294 E. coli strains representing a range of isolates from fecal/commensal strains (n = 88) to strains isolated from clinical cases of asymptomatic bacteriuria (n = 54), complicated UTI (n = 39), uncomplicated cystitis (n = 37), and acute pyelonephritis (n = 76) was examined by multiplex PCR for the presence of papX homologs. Primers were designed to unique flanking sequences of papX and focX and to common regions of both to amplify fragments of a specific size (Fig. 2A, supplemental Table 2). Within this collection, 53% of pyelonephritogenic strains of E. coli contained at least one copy of papX, the highest prevalence within the strain collection and significantly more prevalent than the 32% of asymptomatic bacteriuria strains (p = 0.0192). Only 12.5% of fecal/commensal E. coli contained at least one copy of papX, the lowest prevalence within the strain collection and significantly less prevalent than in asymptomatic bacteriuria strains (p = 0.0081) (Fig. 2B). focX, a close homolog of papX, did not vary significantly in prevalence within the UPEC strain collection (p = 0.7927) (Fig. 2C). This was not surprising because focX is closely associated with genes encoding F1C fimbria, which appears more closely associated with meningitis-associated strains than with UTI-associated strains (31Ott M. Hacker J. Schmoll T. Jarchau T. Korhonen T.K. Goebel W. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 646-653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The association of the pap operon, which encodes P-fimbriae, with pyelonephritogenic strains of UPEC is well documented, with 77% of pyelonephritogenic isolates containing P fimbriae, as compared with only 23% of cystitis, 20% of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and 16% of fecal/commensal isolates (8Korhonen T.K. Väisänen V. Saxén H. Hultberg H. Svenson S.B. Infect. Immun. 1982; 37: 286-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Mulholland S.G. Mooreville M. Parsons C.L. Urology. 1984; 24: 232-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 59% of all strains tested carrying at least one copy of papG also carried at least one copy of papX. Therefore, to differentiate the influence of the increased representation of the pap operon in UTI-causing UPEC from the role of papX alone, we quantified the prevalence of papX in strains containing pap operons for each type of strain within the collection, using the prevalence of papG as a proxy for the prevalence of the pap operon (29Spurbeck R.R. Stapleton A.E. Johnson J.R. Walk S.T. Hooton T.M. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2011; 79: 4753-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Within strains that contained both the pap operon and papX, the relative prevalence of papX compared with papG was significantly higher in cystitis-causing strains of E. coli as compared with fecal/commensal strains (p = 0.0165) (Fig. 2D). The prevalence of strains containing both focX and focH, a proxy for the presence of F1C fimbriae, was not significantly different between UTI-causing strains of E. coli and fecal/commensal strains of E. coli (p = 0.2222) (Fig. 2E). These data indicate that the presence of papX, but not focX, is strongly associated with UPEC. Taken together with the highly conserved nature of the protein sequence between PapX homologs, these data suggest that PapX is a contributor to UPEC virulence but that encoding papX alone is not sufficient to convey virulence to E. coli strains. We previously demonstrated that PapX down-regulates motility (16Simms A.N. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Simms A.N. Mobley H.L. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3747-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In strain CFT073, deletion of the single copy of papX, which resides on the PAI-CFT073pheV- but not PAI-CFT073pheU-associated pap operons (16Simms A.N. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), results in increased motility as compared with wild type. On the contrary, overexpressing papX from the leaky, inducible plasmid pPxWT repressed motility. papX overexpression in CFT073 (pPxWT) has a specific transcriptional effect, with 38 of 42 differentially expressed genes being associated with motility and the downstream effects of flhD and flhC regulation, the master regulator of motility (16Simms A.N. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 4833-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Coupling this finding with the finding that papX appears to be strongly associated with uropathogens, we introduced papX, carried on pPxWT, into strain CFT073 and the prototypical non-pathogenic fecal/commensal E. coli K12 strain MG1655. Motility assays, performed on the resulting transformants, demonstrated that CFT073 had reduced motility in the presence of papX when compared with vector control (Fig. 3A) but that papX had no effect on the motility of the non-pathogenic K12 strain MG1655 (Fig. 3B). This informed us that the role of papX is pathogen-specific. To investigate structure-function relationships within PapX, we constructed a library of linker insertion mutations within papX in pPxWT. 15-nucleotide insertions were randomly introduced along the coding sequence of papX. 30 unique in-frame insertions were generated, covering amino acid residues 15–162 of PapX. Each of the 30 insertional mutants was electroporated into CFT073 ΔpapX."
https://openalex.org/W2040530175,"The swordfish (Xiphias gladius) is a cosmopolitan large pelagic fish inhabiting tempered and tropical waters and it is a target species for fisheries all around the world. The present study investigated the ability of COI barcoding to reliably identify swordfish and particularly specific stocks of this commercially important species.We applied the classical DNA barcoding technology, upon a 682 bp segment of COI, and compared swordfish sequences from different geographical sources (Atlantic, Indian Oceans and Mediterranean Sea). The sequences of the 5' hyper-variable fragment of the control region (5'dloop), were also used to validate the efficacy of COI as a stock-specific marker.This information was successfully applied to the discrimination of unknown samples from the market, detecting in some cases mislabeled seafood products.The NJ distance-based phenogram (K2P model) obtained with COI sequences allowed us to correlate the swordfish haplotypes to the different geographical stocks. Similar results were obtained with 5'dloop. Our preliminary data in swordfish Xiphias gladius confirm that Cytochrome Oxidase I can be proposed as an efficient species-specific marker that has also the potential to assign geographical provenance. This information might speed the samples analysis in commercial application of barcoding."
https://openalex.org/W2141761962,"The vascular type of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is caused by dominant-negative mutations in the procollagen type III (COL3A1) gene. Patients with this autosomal dominant disorder have a shortened life expectancy due to complications from ruptured vessels or hollow organs. We tested the effectiveness of allele-specific RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce the mutated phenotype in fibroblasts. Small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) discriminating between wild-type and mutant COL3A1 allele were identified by a luciferase reporter gene assay and in primary fibroblasts from a normal donor and a patient with vEDS. The best discriminative siRNA with the mutation at position 10 resulted in >90% silencing of the mutant allele without affecting the wild-type allele. Transmission and immunogold electron microscopy of extracted extracellular matrices from untreated fibroblasts of the patient with vEDS revealed structurally abnormal fibrils. After siRNA treatment, collagen fibrils became similar to fibrils from fibroblasts of normal and COL3A1 haploinsufficient donors. In addition, it was shown that expression of mutated COL3A1 activates the unfolded protein response and that reduction of the amount of mutated protein by siRNA reduces cellular stress. Taken together, the results provide evidence that allele-specific siRNAs are able to reduce negative effects of mutated COL3A1 proteins. Thus, the application of allele-specific RNAi may be a promising direction for future personalized therapies to reduce the severity of vEDS.—Müller, G. A., Hansen, U., Xu, Z., Griswold, B., Talan, M.

https://openalex.org/W1982936703,"We recently showed that excessive fructose consumption, already associated with numerous metabolic abnormalities, reduces rates of intestinal Ca(2+) transport. Using a rat lactation model with increased Ca(2+) requirements, we tested the hypothesis that mechanisms underlying these inhibitory effects of fructose involve reductions in renal synthesis of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Pregnant and virgin (control) rats were fed isocaloric fructose or, as controls, glucose, and starch diets from d 2 of gestation to the end of lactation. Compared to virgins, lactating dams fed glucose or starch had higher rates of intestinal transcellular Ca(2+) transport, elevated intestinal and renal expression of Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+)-binding proteins, and CaATPases, as well as increased levels of 25-(OH)D(3) and 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Fructose consumption prevented almost all of these lactation-induced increases, and reduced vitamin D receptor binding to promoter regions of Ca(2+) channels and binding proteins. Changes in 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) level were tightly correlated with alterations in expression of 1α-hydroxylase but not with levels of parathyroid hormone and of 24-hydroxylase. Bone mineral density, content, and mechanical strength each decreased with lactation, but then fructose exacerbated these effects. When Ca(2+) requirements increase during lactation or similar physiologically challenging conditions, excessive fructose consumption may perturb Ca(2+) homeostasis because of fructose-induced reductions in synthesis of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)."

The study of cancer cell dormancy is severely hampered by the lack of biological samples so that the mechanisms that regulate cell dormancy have not been extensively explored. In this work, we describe the rapid induction in vitro of a dormant state in prostate cancer cells by exposure to a slightly hypertonic growth medium. This quiescence is observed only when cells are seeded at low density and, once established, requires additional stimuli besides osmotic pressure to be reversed. Media conditioned by cells grown at high density can partially prevent or reverse dormancy, a phenomenon which can be reproduced with citric acid. In addition to this role of small metabolites, inactivation of the p53 and smad pathways also counters the entry into dormancy, whereas exposure to activin A induces it to some extent. Thus, this easily inducible dormancy reproduces several features associated with the dormancy of stem cells and cancer cells in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2018894186,"Diamagnetic levitation is a technique that uses a strong, spatially varying magnetic field to simulate an altered gravity environment, as in space. In this study, using Streptomyces avermitilis as the test organism, we investigate whether changes in magnetic field and altered gravity induce changes in morphology and secondary metabolism. We find that a strong magnetic field (12T) inhibit the morphological development of S. avermitilis in solid culture, and increase the production of secondary metabolites.S. avermitilis on solid medium was levitated at 0 g*, 1 g* and 2 g* in an altered gravity environment simulated by diamagnetic levitation and under a strong magnetic field, denoted by the asterix. The morphology was obtained by electromicroscopy. The production of the secondary metabolite, avermectin, was determined by OD(245 nm). The results showed that diamagnetic levitation could induce a physiological response in S. avermitilis. The difference between 1 g* and the control group grown without the strong magnetic field (1 g), showed that the magnetic field was a more dominant factor influencing changes in morphology and secondary metabolite production, than altered gravity.We have discovered that magnetic field, rather than altered gravity, is the dominant factor in altered gravity simulated by diamagnetic levitation, therefore care should to be taken in the interpretation of results when using diamagnetic levitation as a technique to simulate altered gravity. Hence, these results are significant, and timely to researchers considering the use of diamagnetic levitation to explore effects of weightlessness on living organisms and on physical phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2138828500,"Patients with severe burns are highly susceptible to bacterial infection. While immunosuppression facilitates infection, the contribution of soft tissues to infection beyond providing a portal for bacterial entry remains unclear. We showed previously that glutathione S-transferase S1 (gstS1), an enzyme with conjugating activity against the lipid peroxidation byproduct 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE), is important for resistance against wound infection in Drosophila muscle. The importance of the mammalian functional counterpart of GstS1 in the context of wounds and infection has not been investigated. Here we demonstrate that the presence of a burn wound dramatically affects expression of both human (hGSTA4) and mouse (mGsta4) 4HNE scavengers. hGSTA4 is down-regulated significantly within 1 wk of thermal burn injury in the muscle and fat tissues of patients from the large-scale collaborative Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury multicentered study. Similarly, mGsta4, the murine GST with the highest catalytic efficiency for 4HNE, is down-regulated to approximately half of normal levels in mouse muscle immediately postburn. Consequently, 4HNE protein adducts are increased 4- to 5-fold in mouse muscle postburn. Using an open wound infection model, we show that deletion of mGsta4 renders mice more susceptible to infection with the prevalent wound pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while muscle hGSTA4 expression negatively correlates with burn wound infection episodes per patient. Our data suggest that hGSTA4 down-regulation and the concomitant increase in 4HNE adducts in human muscle are indicative of susceptibility to infection in individuals with severely thermal injuries."
https://openalex.org/W2081226160,"When a bacterial genome is compared to the metagenome of an environment it inhabits, most genes recruit at high sequence identity. In free-living bacteria (for instance marine bacteria compared against the ocean metagenome) certain genomic regions are totally absent in recruitment plots, representing therefore genes unique to individual bacterial isolates. We show that these Metagenomic Islands (MIs) are also visible in bacteria living in human hosts when their genomes are compared to sequences from the human microbiome, despite the compartmentalized structure of human-related environments such as the gut. From an applied point of view, MIs of human pathogens (e.g. those identified in enterohaemorragic Escherichia coli against the gut metagenome or in pathogenic Neisseria meningitidis against the oral metagenome) include virulence genes that appear to be absent in related strains or species present in the microbiome of healthy individuals. We propose that this strategy (i.e. recruitment analysis of pathogenic bacteria against the metagenome of healthy subjects) can be used to detect pathogenicity regions in species where the genes involved in virulence are poorly characterized. Using this approach, we detect well-known pathogenicity islands and identify new potential virulence genes in several human pathogens."

ANOVA models tested for differences in FK scores across target audiences and over time. Readability was assessed for documents targeting non-technical audiences using the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM). Overall, there was a main-effect by audience, F(5, 82) = 29.72, P<.001, but FK scores did not vary over time, F(2, 82) = .34, P>.05. A time-by-audience interaction was significant, F(10, 82) = 2.11, P<.05. Documents targeting non-technical audiences were found to be text-heavy and densely-formatted.

https://openalex.org/W2132962150,"Behcet's disease is a chronic, multi-systemic autoimmune disease. Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) gene is one of non-human leucocyte antigen genes. It has been demonstrated to be associated with several autoimmune diseases. However, only a few studies have addressed the association of ligand genes of PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 with autoimmune disease. The purpose of this study was to analyze the potential association of the PD-1 and its ligand genes with Behcet's disease in a Chinese Han population.Four single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) rs2227981 and rs10204525 of PD-1, rs1970000 of PD-L1 and rs7854303 of PD-L2 were genotyped in 405 Behcet's patients and 414 age-, sex-, ethnic-matched healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The results revealed that there were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of PD-1 rs2227981 and rs10204525 between the Behcet's patients and controls. A similar result was found for PD-L1 rs1970000 versus healthy controls. Only the C allele and the CC genotype of PD-L2 rs7854303 were identified in patients and controls. Stratification analysis based on gender and clinical findings did not show any associations between PD-1 or its ligand polymorphisms and Behcet's disease.None of the currently studied SNPs, PD-1 rs2227981 and rs10204525, PD-L1 rs1970000 and PD-L2 rs7854303, are associated with the susceptibility to Behcet's disease in a Chinese Han population.

https://openalex.org/W2013589018,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an encapsulated bacterium that causes significant global morbidity and mortality. The nasopharynxes of children are believed to be the natural reservoir of pneumococcus and by adulthood nasopharyngeal carriage is infrequent; such infrequency may be due to demonstrable pneumococcal specific T and B-cell responses. HLA Class 2 tetrameric complexes have been used to characterise antigen specific T-cell responses in a variety of models of infection. We therefore sought to determine the frequency and phenotype of pneumococcal specific T-cells, using a novel HLA-DRB1*1501 tetramer complex incorporating a recently defined T-cell epitope derived from the conserved pneumococcal serine/threonine kinase (StkP). We were able to detect direct ex-vivo StkP(446-60)-tetramer binding in HLA-DRB1*1501 adults. These StkP(446-60)-tetramer binding T-cells had increased CD38 expression and were enriched in CCR7- CD45RA+ expression indicating recent and on-going activation and differentiation. Furthermore, these StkP(446-60)-tetramer binding T-cells demonstrated rapid effector function by secreting interferon-gamma on stimulation with recombinant StkP. This is the first study to directly enumerate and characterise pneumococcal specific T-cells using HLA class 2 tetrameric complexes. We found that ex-vivo pneumococcal-specific T cells were detectable in healthy adults and that they were enriched with cell surface markers associated with recent antigen exposure and later stages of antigen-driven differentiation. It is likely that these activated pneumococcal specific T-cells reflect recent immunostimulatory pneumococcal exposure in the nasopharynx and it is possible that they may be preventing subsequent colonisation and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2033222855,"Background We describe SNPpy, a hybrid script database system using the Python SQLAlchemy library coupled with the PostgreSQL database to manage genotype data from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). This system makes it possible to merge study data with HapMap data and merge across studies for meta-analyses, including data filtering based on the values of phenotype and Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data. SNPpy and its dependencies are open source software. Results The current version of SNPpy offers utility functions to import genotype and annotation data from two commercial platforms. We use these to import data from two GWAS studies and the HapMap Project. We then export these individual datasets to standard data format files that can be imported into statistical software for downstream analyses. Conclusions By leveraging the power of relational databases, SNPpy offers integrated management and manipulation of genotype and phenotype data from GWAS studies. The analysis of these studies requires merging across GWAS datasets as well as patient and marker selection. To this end, SNPpy enables the user to filter the data and output the results as standardized GWAS file formats. It does low level and flexible data validation, including validation of patient data. SNPpy is a practical and extensible solution for investigators who seek to deploy central management of their GWAS data."
https://openalex.org/W2116137808,"Biomarkers are lacking for identifying the switch of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) from tumor-suppressing to tumor-promoting. Mutated p53 (mp53) has been suggested to switch TGF-β to a tumor promoter. However, we found that mp53 does not always promote the oncogenic role of TGF-β. Here, we show that endogenous mp53 knockdown enhanced cell migration and phosphorylation of ERK in DU145 prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of mp53 in p53-null PC-3 prostate cancer cells enhanced Smad-dependent signaling but inhibited TGF-β-induced cell migration by down-regulating activated ERK. Reactivation of ERK by the expression of its activator, MEK-1, restored TGF-β-induced cell migration. Because TGF-β is known to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway through direct phosphorylation of the adaptor protein ShcA and MAPK/ERK signaling is pivotal to tumor progression, we investigated whether ShcA contributed to mp53-induced ERK inhibition and the conversion of the role of TGF-β during carcinogenesis. We found that mp53 expression led to a decrease of phosphorylated p52ShcA/ERK levels and an increase of phosphorylated Smad levels in a panel of mp53-expressing cancer cell lines and in mammary glands and tumors from mp53 knock-in mice. By manipulating ShcA levels to regulate ERK and Smad signaling in human untransformed and cancer cell lines, we showed that the role of TGF-β in regulating anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and migration can be shifted between growth suppression and migration promotion. Thus, our results for the first time suggest that mp53 disrupts the role of ShcA in balancing the Smad-dependent and -independent signaling activity of TGF-β and that ShcA/ERK signaling is a major pathway regulating the tumor-promoting activity of TGF-β.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a tumor suppressor during early tumor outgrowth. However, carcinogenesis-mediated elevation of TGF-β production and signaling is often tumor-promoting at later stages, leading to enhanced tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (1Massagué J. Cell. 2008; 134: 215-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar). Increased TGF-β is often associated with the loss of the growth-inhibitory activity of TGF-β and its conversion to promote malignant progression of cancers (2Sun L. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1925-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), making TGF-β a potential therapeutic target. Indeed, many preclinical studies have shown the efficacy of various types of TGF-β inhibitors in blocking tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in animal models of human and rodent cancer (3Bandyopadhyay A.

However, biomarkers are lacking for signifying the complicated molecular alterations mediating the switch of TGF-β from tumor suppression to tumor promotion and for identifying appropriate cancer patients for therapy with TGF-β inhibitors. As a homodimeric polypeptide in humans and mice, TGF-β signals through cell surface receptors called TGF-β type I (RI) 2The abbreviations used are: RITGF-β type I receptorRIITGF-β type II receptormp53mutant p53SBESmad-binding elementR-Smadreceptor-regulated class of SmadsDNRIIdominant-negative RIIMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideMMTVmurine mammary tumor virusp-ERKphosphorylated ERK*MEK-1constitutively active form of MEK-1. and type II (RII) receptors to regulate multiple cellular functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and wound healing (1Massagué J. Cell. 2008; 134: 215-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar). RI and RII are transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors that also contain tyrosine kinase activity (6Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6315) Google Scholar). Active TGF-β ligands bind first to RII, which then recruits RI, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of RI. Active RI directly phosphorylates the receptor-regulated class of Smads (R-Smad), Smad2/3. Phosphorylated R-Smads in turn associate with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of TGF-β-responsive target genes (1Massagué J.

Besides Smad-mediated canonical signaling, TGF-β also signals through Smad-independent pathways including the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway (7Mulder K.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The integration of TGF-β-mediated-Smad-dependent and -independent signaling is believed to contribute to the key events of TGF-β-induced tumor progression including ERK signaling-mediated cell migration (8Davies M.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). TGF-β activates Ras/ERK signaling through the direct phosphorylation of the adaptor protein ShcA (10Lee M.K.

ShcA belongs to the family of Shc adaptor proteins, which are substrates of receptor tyrosine kinases (11Ravichandran K.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6322-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). ShcA consists of three isoforms, p46, p52, and p66. They are derived from two different transcripts, called p66 and p52/p46 mRNAs (12Luzi L. Confalonieri S. Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Current Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Compared with p52ShcA, p46ShcA results from a different in-frame ATG transcript and is predominantly expressed in mitochondria with an elusive role (13Ventura A. Maccarana M. Raker V.A. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Following the TGF-β engagement, tyrosine-phosphorylated RI recruits and directly phosphorylates p52/46ShcA proteins on tyrosine sites, leading to their association with Grb2 adaptor protein and Sos GTP exchange factor (14van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The ShcA-Grb2-Sos complex activates Ras (15Lotti L.V. Lanfrancone L.

Among the three tyrosine phosphorylation sites at residues 239/240 (Tyr-239/240) and 317 (Tyr-317) in the CH1 domain of p52/46ShcA, Tyr-317 plays the major role in Ras/ERK signaling activation (11Ravichandran K.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6322-6330Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 16Ursini-Siegel J. Muller W.J. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Clinical studies have shown that a high amount of Tyr-317-phosphorylated p52/46ShcA alone with a low amount of p66ShcA serves as an efficient predictor for identifying aggressive breast tumors with a high risk of recurrence (17Davol P.A. Bagdasaryan R. Elfenbein G.J. Maizel A.L. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6772-6783PubMed Google Scholar, 18Frackelton Jr., A.R. Lu L. Davol P.A. Bagdasaryan R. Hafer L.J. Sgroi D.C.

Cell. 2008; 134: 215-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether ShcA-mediated activation of ERK signaling contributes to the switch of TGF-β function during carcinogenesis. A recently published study has shown that the presence of mutated p53 (mp53) in the DNA-binding domain in certain cells together with additional Ras activation can switch TGF-β activity to that of a tumor promoter in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line and H1299 non-small cell lung cancer cell line (19Adorno M.

Somatic mutation-induced inactivation of p53 occurs in about 50% of human cancers including breast and prostate cancer (20Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6759) Google Scholar). p53 mutation is considered a biomarker of advanced prostate cancer in which prostate cancer cells lose differentiated phenotypes and transit from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent growth (21Navone N.M. Troncoso P. Pisters L.L. Goodrow T.L. Palmer J.L. Nichols W.W. von Eschenbach A.C. Conti C.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1657-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Rather than losing the wild-type p53 (WTp53), the tumor with retention of mp53 has been shown to be more aggressive and associated with poor outcome in certain cancer types (22Soussi T. Béroud C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). For example, mp53 was shown to enhance the cell migration and invasion in breast and lung cancer cell lines (23Wang S.P. Wang W.L. Chang Y.L. Wu C.T. Chao Y.C. Kao S.H. Yuan A. Lin C.W. Yang S.C. Chan W.K. Li K.C. Hong T.M. Yang P.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 694-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, the role of mp53 in mediating the key steps of cancer progression including cell migration and invasion is largely cell context-dependent and controversial (24Oren M. Rotter V. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2a001107Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). For example, in human endometrial cancer cells, the p53 R213Q mutation does not promote cell migration (25Dong P. Tada M. Hamada J. Nakamura A. Moriuchi T. Sakuragi N. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2007; 24: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As shown in another study using the H1299 cell line, p53 R175H negatively regulates cell migration when TGF-β/Smad signaling is repressed (26Kalo E. Buganim Y. Shapira K.E. Besserglick H. Goldfinger N. Weisz L. Stambolsky P. Henis Y.I. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8228-8242Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). At present, the cellular context for mp53 to exert its oncogenic activity is underexplored. In addition, little is known about whether mp53 alone is sufficient to activate the switch of TGF-β during tumor progression. To gain a more thorough understanding of the effect of mp53 on tumor progression, particularly with respect to the role of TGF-β signaling, we investigated whether mp53 contributes to the conversion of the role of TGF-β in the regulation of cell growth and migration. Here, we show that mp53 alone is not sufficient to promote the oncogenic role of TGF-β. We further demonstrate that mp53 disrupts the role of ShcA in altering the signaling strength of TGF-β through ERK and Smad pathways in certain human untransformed and cancer cell lines and mice with mp53 knock-in. ShcA-mediated ERK signaling appears to play a more dominant role in conferring the tumor-promoting activity of TGF-β in the regulation of cell growth and migration. Our finding provides novel insight into the role of ShcA as a promising biomarker in driving TGF-β signaling toward tumor promotion.

U0126 is an MEK-1/2 inhibitor from Calbiochem. p52/46ShcA plasmid was purchased from Origene. p53 R175H-pCMV-Neo-Bam plasmid was provided by Dr. Harikrishna Nakshatri. p53 R273H-pCDNA3 plasmid was provided by Dr. Zhi-Min Yuan. Human WTp53 expression plasmid pRc/CMV hp53 was obtained from Dr. Arnold Levine. Constitutively active MEK-1 plasmid was provided by Dr. Kun-Liang Guan. Stable transfection of p53 R175H into PC-3 cells was performed by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after the transfection, G418 selection of neomycin-resistant cells was conducted for 1 week. The sequence of p53 siRNA 1 is 5′-CCG GAC GAU AUU GAA CAA UGG UUC A-3′, and the sequence of p53 siRNA 2 is 5′-GCU-UCG AGA UGU UCC GAG AGC UGA A-3′ (Invitrogen). The sequence of ShcA siRNA is 5′-GAC UAA GGA UCA CCG CUU U-3′ (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO).

The sequence of RII shRNA is 5′-CCG GCC TGA CTT GTT GCT AGT CAT ACT CGA GTA TGA CTA GCA ACA AGT CAG GTT TTG-3′. The process of generating MCF-10A cells with stable knockdown of RII was conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoblotting analyses were performed as described previously (30Lei X. Bandyopadhyay A. Le T. Sun L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7514-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were obtained from the following sources: p-Smad2, p-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), p-ShcA (Tyr-317), total-ERK, and MEK-1/2 from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); p-Smad3 from Epitomics (Burlingame, CA); total Smad2/3 from BD Transduction Laboratories; p53 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); total ShcA from BD Biosciences; and RII from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Relative expression levels of the indicated genes were quantified with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Cell migration assays were performed in 24-well Boyden chambers with 8-μm pore polycarbonate membranes (BD Biosciences). Cells at the indicated number in serum-free medium were seeded in the upper insert. Complete medium with or without treatment was added in the lower chamber. After 18 h, cells that had migrated through the membrane were stained with the Hema 3 Stain 18 kit (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Migrated cells were counted under a microscope with 100× magnification. Cells were plated in a 96-well plate at 2,500 cells/well with or without TGF-β1 treatment. Two hours before each time point, 50 μl of MTT (2 mg/ml in PBS) was added into each well, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for another 2 h. DMSO (100 μl) was added into each well after the medium was removed. For dissolving the precipitate, the plate was gently shaken on a shaker for 10 min. The absorbance was measured at 595 nm with a microplate reader (BioTek Instrument, Winooski, VT). Cells in 1 ml of 0.4% low melting agarose (Invitrogen) with culture medium were plated at 6,000 cells/well on top of existing 0.8% agarose in 6-well plates. The wells were covered with 1 ml of culture medium containing various treatments and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for the indicated number of days. Visualized colonies were counted after staining with p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (Sigma) overnight. The pSBE4-Luc plasmid with Smad-responsive promoter and luciferase reporter gene was used to measure the TGF-β-induced transcriptional activity (31Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). Cells at 100,000 cells/well were plated in 12-well plates. After 24 h, the pSBE4-Luc plasmid (0.4 μg) was transiently co-transfected with a β-galactosidase expression plasmid (0.1 μg) into the cells by using Lipofectamine 2000. TGF-β1 was added to the transfected cells 5 h later. After an additional 20 h of incubation, cells were lysed, and the activities of luciferase and β-galactosidase of the cell lysates were assayed as described previously (32Chen C. Wang X.F. Sun L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12862-12867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. C57BL/6 mice with a heterozygous p53R172H mutation were described previously (33Lang G.A. Iwakuma T. Suh Y.A. Liu G. Rao V.A. Parant J.M. Valentin-Vega Y.A. Terzian T. Caldwell L.C. Strong L.C. El-Naggar A.K. Lozano G. Cell. 2004; 119: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Heterozygous p53R172P mice were generated in a similar way (34Liu G. Parant J.M. Lang G. Chau P. Chavez-Reyes A. El-Naggar A.K. Multani A. Chang S. Lozano G. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). They were crossed to C57BL/6 pun/un mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) (35Aubrecht J. Secretan M.B. Bishop A.J. Schiestl R.H. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Heterozygous breeding cohorts of p53R172P/+ pun/un and p53R172H/+ pun/un were intercrossed to produce the p53R172P/R172P pun/un, p53R172H/R172H pun/un, and p53+/+ pun/un mice. MMTV-Wnt1 mice were bred with p53+/+ or p53R172H/+ mice to generate MMTV-Wnt1 mice in p53+/+, p53R172H/+, and p53R172H/R172H backgrounds. A fraction of tumors in the p53R172H/+ background undergo loss of heterozygosity (herein referred to as p53R172H/O) and thus are functionally p53 mutants. Loss of heterozygosity analysis was performed as described previously (36Post S.M. Quintás-Cardama A. Terzian T. Smith C. Eischen C.M. Lozano G. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 1260-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The tumor sizes were measured regularly with a caliper in two dimensions. Tumor volumes (V) were calculated with the equation V = (L × W2) × 0.5 where L is length and W is width. When tumors reached a volume of ∼500 mm3, mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were collected. The isolated mammary tissues from p53R172P/R172P pun/un, p53R172H/R172H pun/un, and p53+/+ pun/un mice or breast tumors from MMTV-Wnt1-p53+/+, -p53R172H/R172H and -p53R172H/O mice were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Proteins for immunoblotting analysis were isolated from liquid nitrogen by grinding tissues using T-Per extraction reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two-tailed Student's t tests were used to determine the significant difference between two mean values from the control and experimental data. All statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 3.03 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). To investigate whether mp53 alone can promote tumor migration, we knocked down mp53 in the human prostate cancer cell line DU145 containing inactivating endogenous p53 P223L and V274F mutations in its DNA-binding domain (37Isaacs W.B. Carter B.S. Ewing C.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4716-4720PubMed Google Scholar). We found that instead of making cells less migratory mp53 knockdown significantly enhanced cell migration accompanied by the activation of ERK via phosphorylation (p-ERK) (Fig. 1, A and B). Active ERK signaling is reported to be essential for tumor metastasis progression including cell migration (9Reddy K.B. Nabha S.M. Atanaskova N. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mp53 depletion-induced migration was likely caused by the up-regulated ERK signaling. We further stably introduced mutant p53 R175H with a mutation in its DNA-binding domain into the p53-null human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 (PC-3/mp53). This resulted in the repression of cell migration as well as the down-regulation of ERK signaling (Fig. 1, C and D). These data indicate that mp53 in certain prostate cell lines attenuates cell migration, which is a key step of procancer metastasis. The presence of mp53 has been shown to facilitate the tumor-promoting activity of TGF-β in some breast cancer models (19Adorno M. Cordenonsi M. Montagner M. Dupont S. Wong C. Hann B. Solari A. Bobisse S. Rondina M.B. Guzzardo V. Parenti A.R. Rosato A. Bicciato S. Balmain A. Piccolo S. Cell. 2009; 137: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Because mp53 was found not to enhance cell migration in our studies with two prostate cancer cells, we explored whether mp53 showed a different effect on the oncogenic role of TGF-β. We observed that TGF-β significantly increased migration of the control PC-3 cells, whereas it suppressed migration in the PC-3/mp53 cells, suggesting that the activity of TGF-β is affected by the presence of mp53 (Fig. 2A). Because PC-3 is a tumorigenic cell line, we next performed a soft agar colony formation assay to assess the effect of p53 R175H on the growth of PC-3 cells in an anchorage-independent manner. We found that the presence of p53 R175H repressed the anchorage-independent growth ability of PC-3/mp53 cells compared with cells without mp53. Interestingly, the colony formation was more dramatically inhibited by TGF-β, and the treatment with HTS466284, an RI kinase inhibitor (29Singh J. Chuaqui C.E. Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Lee W.C. Pontz T. Corbley M.J. Cheung H.K. Arduini R.M. Mead J.N. Newman M.N. Papadatos J.L. Bowes S. Josiah S. Ling L.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 4355-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), significantly stimulated colony formation in PC-3/mp53 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). To rule out the possibility that the p53 R175H-reduced cell migration in PC-3 cells was due to an altered cell growth rate, we verified that the presence of p53 R175H in PC-3 cells showed little effect on cell growth but that TGF-β treatment induced a moderate growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). Thus, these results indicate that p53 R175H alone is not sufficient to switch TGF-β to be more tumor-promoting in the PC-3 cell line. Considering that TGF-β-inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth is mainly due to Smad-dependent signaling (38Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 39Ramachandra M. Atencio I. Rahman A. Vaillancourt M. Zou A. Avanzini J. Wills K. Bookstein R. Shabram P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6045-6051PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether p53 R175H could alter the activation of TGF-β/Smad signaling in PC-3/mp53 cells. We found that p53 R175H made PC-3 cells more sensitive to TGF-β in a dose-dependent manner as evidenced by higher levels of TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 (Fig. 2E). Additionally, the transcriptional activity of TGF-β was also increased in PC-3/mp53 cells when compared with the control cells as detected with transfection of a Smad-responsive promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (SBE-Luc) (Fig. 2F), further indicating that the presence of p53 R175H enhanced the Smad-dependent signaling. These results revealed that the addition of p53 R175H to PC-3 cells enhanced TGF-β/Smad-signaling while inhibiting TGF-β-induced cell migration. It is suggested that Smad-dependent and -independent signaling pathways work together to drive the key events of TGF-β-induced cell migration and metastasis (8Davies M. Robinson M. Smith E. Huntley S. Prime S. Paterson I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 95: 918-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, our observations indicate that Smad-dependent signaling is not responsible for the loss of TGF-β-induced migration in PC-3/mp53 cells as reflected by the enhanced TGF-β/Smad signaling. Consequently, we speculated that MAPK/ERK signaling might be involved in the loss of TGF-β-induced cell migration of PC-3/mp53 cells. Consistent with our observation above (Fig. 1C), we found that the basal level of p-ERK was markedly reduced in the PC-3/mp53 cells when compared with control cells (Fig. 3A). Additionally, TGF-β was unable to further activate ERK in PC-3/mp53 cells (Fig. 3A). To confirm that this observation was specifically due to mp53 expression and not an aberrant selection of a pool of antibiotic-resistant clones, we transiently introduced p53 R175H into PC-3 cells and found that p-ERK was greatly reduced when compared with PC-3 cells transfected with a control plasmid or a WTp53 expression plasmid (Fig. 3B). In parallel, p53 R175H knockdown in PC-3/mp53 cells with p53 siRNA restored the p-ERK level (Fig. 3C). We additionally used another p53 mutation in the DNA-binding domain, p53 R273H, which also enhanced TGF-β-stimulated phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and inhibited the basal and TGF-β-stimulated p-ERK levels. Consistently, p53 R273H also significantly attenuated TGF-β-induced cell migration of PC-3 cells in comparison with the control cells (Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. 1A). However, exogenous human WTp53 expression in PC-3 cells showed no effect on the level of TGF-β-induced cell migration, TGF-β-induced activation of ERK, or Smad signaling (Fig. 3E and supplemental Fig. 1B). Because tyrosine-phosphorylated p52ShcA has been shown to positively mediate TGF-β-activated Ras/ERK signaling (10Lee M.K. Pardoux C. Hall M.C. Lee P.S. Warburton D. Qing J. Smith S.M. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3957-3967Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), we next examined whether the mp53-inhibited phosphorylation of ERK was linked to the down-regulation of p-p52ShcA. Indeed,"

As a result of this binding, recombinant soluble gp41 and gp41 peptide 6358 activated the CD74-mediated ERK/MAPK pathway and significantly enhanced HIV-1 infection in vitro.

Its extracellular domain contains four major regions, including fusion peptide, N-terminal heptad repeats, loop, and C-terminal heptad repeats. The gp41 trimer is embedded in the virus membrane and covered by surface protein gp120 (3Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). In a current membrane fusion model, gp120 first binds to cell surface CD4 and a chemokine receptor (CCR5/CXCR4), resulting in a conformational change of the complex and the exposure of gp41. Then the gp41 trimer ejects and inserts its fusion peptides into the target cell membrane. After that, the N-terminal heptad repeats and the C-terminal heptad repeats of gp41 are rearranged to form a stable six-helix bundle that brings the membranes of both virus and cells into close proximity to finally accomplish the fusion process and infection of the target cells (4Chan D.C.

Although we know that the HIV-1 gp41 could change conformation triggered by gp120-CD4 interaction and mediate virus-cell fusion, it is unclear whether gp41 itself can interact with the cell surface proteins to trigger cell signals for regulating viral infection and host cell function. We and others have demonstrated that besides its involvement in the viral entry process, gp41 could also regulate cell functions by interacting with a variety of cellular proteins. For instance, the recombinant soluble gp41 (rsgp41) could selectively enhance the surface expression of MHC-1 and ICAM-1 (12Chen Y.H. Böck G. Vornhagen R. Steindl F. Katinger H. Dierich M.P. Int.

A recent study found that gp41 modulates the proliferation of T lymphocytes through its transmembrane region (14Cohen T. Cohen S.J. Antonovsky N. Cohen I.R. Shai Y. PLOS Pathog. 2010; 6e1001085 Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, gp41 could regulate the expression and the activity of chemokine receptors on monocytes (15Ueda H. Howard O.M.

Finally, gp41 might be involved in endocytosis of HIV-1 by interacting with proteins such as caveolin-1 and epsin (16Hovanessian A.G. Briand J.P. Said E.A. Svab J. Ferris S. Dali H. Muller S.

Hence, searching for novel gp41-binding proteins and studying their involvement in regulating HIV-1 infection would provide useful information for understanding the role of gp41 in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. In this study, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screening to discover novel gp41-binding proteins, and we discovered CD74, also known as the MHC class II-associated invariant chain. CD74 is a receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (19Leng L. Metz C.N. Fang Y. Xu J. Donnelly S. Baugh J. Delohery T. Chen Y. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp.

Here, we analyzed the interaction between gp41 and CD74 as well as the functional effect of the gp41-CD74 interaction on HIV-1 infection. Our data provided evidence that HIV-1 gp41 could enhance HIV-1 infection in vitro by inducing the activation of the CD74-mediated ERK/MAPK pathway.

Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 293T cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. The Matchmaker GAL4 two-hybrid system (Clontech) was used for the screening, and all procedures followed the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the HIV-1 rsgp41 (aa 539–684) gene fragment was cloned into plasmid pGBKT7 as the bait. The plasmid was then transformed into yeast strain AH109 to test for bait expression, toxicity, and autoactivation. For screening, the bait strain AH109 (pGBKT7-rsgp41) was mated with yeast strain Y187 which contained the human bone marrow cDNA library (Matchmaker 630477). The hybrid culture was plated on SD/−Trp/−Leu/−His (TDO) selective medium. Clones grown on these plates were further plated onto SD/−Trp/−Leu/−His/-Ade/X-α-gal (QDO/X-α-gal) medium. Blue clones were selected, and the plasmids were recovered for sequencing. For β-galactosidase assays, 2-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG; Sigma) was used as substrate. Briefly, 1.5 ml of yeast culture in mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5–0.8) was harvested and resuspended in 0.3 ml of buffer Z (thus concentration factor = 5). The cells were broken by three freeze/thaw cycles (liquid nitrogen and 37 °C water bath). After adding ONPG, the samples were incubated at 30 °C until a yellow color developed, and the elapsed time t was recorded. The A420 of the samples was measured using a spectrophotometer. The β-galactosidase units were calculated based on the following formula: β-galactosidase units = 1,000 × A420/(t × V × A600), where V = 0.1 × concentration factor. The cDNA fragment coding for the CD74 extracellular domain (aa 76–232) was amplified from yeast vector pGADT7-CD74 and cloned into pET-28(a) vector (Novagen). The recombinant plasmid was sequenced and used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). After induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h, the E. coli cells were harvested, resuspended in MCAC-20, and broken by sonication. The sample was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. The protein in the supernatants was purified by Ni+-NTA affinity chromatography (eluted by MCAC-250). The purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. For the pulldown assay, BSA and rsgp41 were respectively conjugated to Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare). 1 × 107 Raji cells were lysed with TGH buffer (50 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 1× protein inhibitor) at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. Supernatants were incubated with BSA beads or rsgp41 beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times by washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl). The precipitated complexes were eluted from the beads by boiling with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The CD74 protein was detected by Western blotting, using rabbit anti-CD74 polyclonal antibodies. For immunoprecipitation assay, the full-length CD74 gene (aa 17–232) was PCR-amplified and cloned into pCMV-Myc vector (24Strubin M. Long E.O. Mach B. Cell. 1986; 47: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The rsgp41 (aa 539–684) gene fragment was cloned into pCMV-HA vector. 5 × 105 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA using Vigofect reagent (Vigorous Biotechnology). Cells were collected 48 h later and lysed with TGH buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. Supernatants were incubated with 5 μl of mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody and 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose (sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times in washing buffer. The CD74 protein was detected by anti-CD74 polyclonal antibodies. To determine the gp41-CD74 interaction in HIV-1-infected cells, human monocytic U937 cells were infected with HIV-1 NL4-3. Three days after infection, the cells were collected and lysed with TGH buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min. Supernatants were incubated with 5 μl of 2F5 antibody (Polymun) and 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were collected and washed, and CD74 was detected as described above. Proteins (5 μg/ml) and peptides (10 μg/ml) were coated on 96-well plates with 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.0), at 4 °C overnight. The plates were blocked by 0.3% gelatin at room temperature for 2 h. Gradient diluted (4-fold, starting from 5 μg/ml) rCD74 was added to the wells (50 μl/well) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were washed five times with 0.5% PBS and Tween 20. The rCD74 that bound to the proteins and peptides was detected by mouse anti-rCD74 serum, rabbit anti-mouse antibodies, and substrate o-phenylenediamine, sequentially. The absorbances at 450 nm were measured. ITC was performed using a NANO-ITC (low volume) (TA Instruments). Solutions were degassed under vacuum prior to use. Briefly, 0.05 mm rsgp41 dissolved in PBS (pH 7.2) was injected into the chamber containing 0.01 mm rCD74 (pH 7.2). The time between injections was 200 s, and the stirring speed was 350 rpm. The dilution temperatures were determined in control experiments by injecting rsgp41 into PBS buffer. The experiments were carried out at 37 °C. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Launch NanoAnalyze software. H9/HTLV-IIIB cells were incubated with or without rCD74 (50 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed with washing buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% FBS) three times. Then cells were incubated with anti-His monoclonal antibodies at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing three times, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako, 1:50 dilution with PBS) at 4 °C for 30 min. After three washes, the cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). In the enhancement test with sCD4, the cells were first incubated with sCD4 (5 μg/ml). In the blockade test with peptide 6358, the peptide (50 μg/ml) was incubated with rCD74 and added to the cells. PBMCs were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS. Cells (2 × 106) were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated by peptide 6358 or rsgp41 at indicated concentrations in serum-free medium for 2 h. After that, the cells were washed by PBS and lysed by SDS sample buffer. Equal amount of samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p44/p42) was detected by Western blotting of cell lysates using specific antibodies directed against phospho-p44/p42 or total p44/p42 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (25Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The recombinant CD74 protein and a monoclonal antibody against CD74 (LN-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were tested to inhibit the activation of the ERK signaling. The effects of proteins and peptides on HIV-1 infection were determined using TZM-bl reporter cells, as described previously (26Jiang S. Lu H. Liu S. Zhao Q. He Y. Debnath A.K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4349-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), with slight modification. TZM-bl cells (1 × 104/well) were serum-starved for 16 h and stimulated by gp41 peptides or rsgp41 at indicated concentrations for 2 h. After that, the cells were washed and incubated with virus for 3 h without serum. Next, the culture medium was replaced by fresh DMEM containing 5% FBS. The cells were harvested and lysed 3 days after infection, and the luciferase activities were measured using a luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and a luminometer (Ultra 384; Tecan, Durham, NC). To inhibit the enhancing effect, rCD74 was incubated with peptide 6358 and rsgp41 for 1 h before adding to the cells. Alternatively, the cells were pretreated with 20 μm PD98059 (P215; Sigma) for 1 h before adding peptide 6358 or rsgp41. To identify novel proteins able to bind to HIV-1 gp41, we screened a human bone marrow library, using rsgp41 as the bait. We found a candidate cDNA insert, which encoded a 157-amino acid protein sequence similar to the C-terminal region of human CD74. CD74 is a type II integral membrane protein. It consists of a 30-amino acid N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a 26-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 160-amino acid extracellular domain (Fig. 1A) (24Strubin M. Long E.O. Mach B. Cell. 1986; 47: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To verify the interaction between CD74 and rsgp41, the bait plasmids, pGBKT7-rsgp41 and pGBKT7-p53 (control), and the library plasmids, pGADT7-CD74 and pGADT7-T (control), were pairwise co-transformed into yeast strain Y187. Only the yeasts containing pGADT7-CD74/pGBKT7-rsgp41 activated the reporter gene lacZ in the same manner as the positive control pGBKT7-p53/pGADT7-T (Fig. 1B), indicating that CD74 specifically binds to rsgp41. The CD74 fragment was then cloned into pET-28(a) vector and expressed in E. coli. After purification by Ni+-NTA affinity chromatography, the recombinant CD74 (rCD74) showed a single band on SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 1C). To test whether rsgp41 could bind endogenous CD74, BSA and rsgp41 conjugated to Sepharose 4 beads were used to pull down the CD74 in human Raji cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the BSA beads did not capture any proteins, whereas the rsgp41 beads precipitated CD74 in Raji cell lysates (Fig. 2A). To determine the gp41-CD74 binding in mammalian cells, plasmids encoding the full-length CD74 and HA-tagged rsgp41 were co-transfected into 293T cells. HA-rsgp41 in supernatants of the cell lysates was captured by anti-HA mAb, and the full-length CD74 was co-precipitated with rsgp41 and detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). To investigate the interaction of gp41 and CD74 in HIV-1-infected cells, human monocytic U937 cells that constitutively express endogenous CD74 were infected with HIV-1 NL4-3 strain. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-gp41 antibodies (2F5) and then blotted with anti-CD74 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2C, anti-gp41 antibodies (2F5) efficiently co-precipitated CD74 from HIV-1 NL4-3-infected cells but could not capture CD74 in uninfected cells. These results confirmed a direct interaction between HIV-1 gp41 and host cell CD74. We further characterized the interaction between rsgp41 and CD74 using several different assays. First, we confirmed the binding of rCD74 to rsgp41 by ELISA (Fig. 3A). Then, we determined the binding of rCD74 to rsgp41 in solution phase by ITC, which directly measures the heat released or absorbed during the binding process. 50 μm rsgp41 dissolved in PBS was injected into the ITC cell containing 10 μm rCD74 in PBS. The binding affinity of rsgp41 to rCD74 was calculated as Ka = 1.8 × 106 m−1 (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the CD74 binding site on rspg41 was determined using different components of rsgp41, including N36, C34, N36/C34, 3NC, loop, and membrane-proximal external region. Compared with other components, the gp41 loop strongly bound to rCD74 (Fig. 4A), indicating that gp41 interacts with CD74 mainly through its loop region. Using a series of peptides that cover the entire loop region, we further narrowed the binding site around peptide 6358 (Fig. 4, B and C).FIGURE 4Narrowing the CD74 binding site on gp41. A, rCD74 binds to the gp41 loop. B, rCD74 binds to peptides derived from the gp41 loop. The figure is representative of two independent experiments carried out in triplicate (mean ± S.D. (error bars)). C, amino acid sequences of a series of overlapping peptides that cover the gp41 loop region are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because gp41 and CD74 are both membrane proteins, we reasoned that they interact on the cell surface. So we tested whether rCD74 could bind to native gp41 existing on HIV-1IIIB-infected H9 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, rCD74 could directly bind to HIV-1IIIB-infected H9 cells compared with uninfected H9 cells. Treating cells with soluble CD4 (sCD4) enhanced the binding to H9IIIB cells but not to H9 cells, because sCD4 induces the shedding of gp120, resulting in an increased exposure of gp41. Conversely, adding gp41 peptide 6358 (aa 597–611) strongly inhibited the binding of rCD74 to H9IIIB cells. These results suggested that rCD74 could bind to native gp41 on the cell surface. We next tested whether rCD74 could bind to HIV-1 virions. To this end, rCD74 was conjugated with Ni+-NTA and incubated with the virus on ice for 2 h. The unbound virus was washed and removed by centrifugation, and the sediment was detected using an HIV-1 p24 test kit. As shown in Fig. 4B, both HIV-1 strains IIIB and Bal were precipitated by rCD74. Treating the virus with sCD4 significantly enhanced the binding, whereas gp41 peptide 6358 strongly inhibited it. CD74 mediates several important signaling pathways, including the ERK/MAPK pathway, which can be initiated by MIF. Because peptide 6358 and rsgp41 could bind CD74, we tested whether they could also activate the ERK/MAPK pathway. PBMCs were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of peptide 6358 and rsgp41, respectively. Then, using specific monoclonal antibodies, total ERK and the phosphor-ERK molecules were detected by Western blotting. We found that both peptide 6358 and rsgp41 induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A), and this effect could be inhibited by an anti-CD74 mAb (LN2) and by rCD74 (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that HIV-1 gp41 is able to activate the ERK/MAPK pathway by binding to CD74. It has been reported that activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway could enhance HIV-1 infection (27Jacqué J.M. Mann A. Enslen H. Sharova N. Brichacek B. Davis R.J. Stevenson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2607-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 28Yang X. Gabuzda D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3460-3466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because peptide 6358 and rsgp41 activated the ERK/MAPK pathway, we tested their effect on HIV-1 infection using TZM-bl reporter cells. As shown in Fig. 7, peptide 6358 significantly enhanced HIV-1 infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A), whereas the upstream neighboring peptide 6355 did not enhance HIV-1 infection (Fig. 7B). The peptide 6358-mediated enhancing effect was inhibited by rCD74 or PD98059 (a MEK1 inhibitor that blocks the ERK/MAPK pathway) (Fig. 7, C and E). Similarly, rsgp41 enhanced HIV-1 infection in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was blocked by rCD74 and PD98059 (Fig. 7, D and E). These results suggested that gp41 could enhance HIV-1 infection by activating the ERK/MAPK pathway. It has been reported that rsgp41 could directly bind to human lymph cell lines through interactions with several proteins on those cells, and such binding could be inhibited by the gp41-derived peptides named Env60 (aa 591–605) and Env66 (aa 651–665). At least five kinds of proteins were separated from those cells using rsgp41. However, their sequence remains elusive (29Chen Y.H. Ebenbichler C. Vornhagen R. Schulz T.F. Steindl F. Böck G. Katinger H. Dierich M.P. Aids. 1992; 6: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Chen Y.H. Böck G. Vornhagen R. Steindl F. Katinger H. Dierich M.P. Mol.

Lett. 1993; 37: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Similarly, Henderson et al. have found that the immunosuppressive peptide of gp41 (aa 583–599) (33Ruegg C.L. Monell C.R. Strand M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3257-3260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Denner J. Norley S. Kurth R. AIDS. 1994; 8: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), when conjugated to BSA, could bind to CD4+ T cells and inhibit T cell proliferation; they have also separated two gp41-binding proteins with uncertain sequences (35Qureshi N.M. Coy D.H. Garry R.F. Henderson L.A. AIDS. 1990; 4: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 36Henderson L.A. Qureshi M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15291-15297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified CD74 as a gp41-binding protein. Biological analysis demonstrated that HIV-1 gp41 could bind to the extracellular domain of CD74 and that this binding is mainly mediated by the gp41 loop. Using a series of overlapping peptides covering the loop region, we further narrowed the binding sites to the sequence around peptide 6358 (aa 597–611). These studies indicate that the gp41 loop region is an important component in controlling the mediation of viral-host interactions and regulating cell functions. CD74 is a versatile protein that performs multiple functions. It was initially recognized as the MHC II invariant chain, which binds to class II MHC molecules in endoplasmic reticulum and regulates the targeting and maturing of MHC II complex (37Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 259-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have revealed that CD74 is also independently expressed on the cell surface (38Henne C. Schwenk F. Koch N. Moller P. Immunology. 1995; 84: 177-182PubMed Google Scholar) and serves as a receptor for MIF (19Leng L. Metz C.N. Fang Y. Xu J. Donnelly S. Baugh J. Delohery T. Chen Y. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 39Leng L. Bucala R. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, in gastric epithelial cells, CD74 is utilized by Helicobacter pylori as a receptor to facilitate virus adhesion and infection (40Beswick E.J. Bland D.A. Suarez G. Barrera C.A. Fan X. Reyes V.E. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2736-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked what functional significance might be extrapolated from the binding of HIV-1 gp41 to CD74. Considering that surface-expressed CD74 serves as a signal receptor for MIF, we explored the effect of gp41 on CD74-mediated signal transduction. Using PBMCs as target cells, we observed that both rsgp41 and the peptide 6358 induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which marked the activation of the CD74-mediated ERK/MAPK pathway. The ERK/MAPK pathway is highly conserved and can be mediated by different kinds of stimuli and receptors (41Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Besides MIF and CD74, stimuli, such as growth factors, cytokines, mitogens, as well as receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors, can also mediate the ERK/MAPK pathway (42Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3488) Google Scholar, 43Chang T.L. Gordon C.J. Roscic-Mrkic B. Power C. Proudfoot A.E. Moore J.P. Trkola A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Earlier studies on RANTES (CCL5, the CCR5 ligand) have revealed that RANTES at low concentrations displays mainly HIV-1 inhibitory activities as a consequence of its strong binding to CCR5 which inhibits the membrane fusion process. However, at higher concentrations, RANTES efficiently activates the cellular ERK/MAPK pathway, resulting in an enhanced HIV-1 infection (43Chang T.L. Gordon C.J. Roscic-Mrkic B. Power C. Proudfoot A.E. Moore J.P. Trkola A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 44Roscic-Mrkic B. Fischer M. Leemann C. Manrique A. Gordon C.J. Moore J.P. Proudfoot A.E. Trkola A. Blood. 2003; 102: 1169-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 45Trkola A. Gordon C. Matthews J. Maxwell E. Ketas T. Czaplewski L. Proudfoot A.E. Moore J.P. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6370-6379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the enhancement of HIV-1 infection by activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway. On the one hand, ERK/MAPK could phosphorylate various downstream substrates, including transcription factors and other protein kinases (i.e. Ets-1, c-Jun, c-Myc, and NF-κB), which regulate host gene expression and lead to cell proliferation, thus priming cells for HIV-1 replication (25Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 46McCubrey J.A. Steelman L.S. Chappell W.H. Abrams S.L. Wong E.W. Chang F. Lehmann B. Terrian D.M. Milella M. Tafuri A. Stivala F. Libra M. Basecke J. Evangelisti C. Martelli A.M. Franklin R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1263-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the phosphor-ERK could also phosphorylate viral proteins (i.e. gag MA, Vif, Rev, Tat, and Nef) and promote the nuclear translocation and integration process to enhance viral infection (28Yang X. Gabuzda D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3460-3466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Yang X. Gabuzda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29879-29887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 48Marozsan A.J. Torre V.S. Johnson M. Ball S.C. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Quiñones-Mateu M.E. Offord R.E. Arts E.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8624-8638Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In comparison, we observed in this study that rsgp41 and gp41 peptide 6358 activated the ERK/MAPK pathway and enhanced HIV-1 infection in vitro. This effect was very similar to that of RANTES, except the receptor of rsgp41 and peptide 6358 was CD74, not CCR5. However, unlike RANTES, or other exogenous stimuli, rsgp41 and the peptide 6358 were both derived from gp41, indicating that HIV-1 might be able to regulate the important ERK/MAPK pathway as well as its infectivity through gp41 or its fragments. In an earlier report, using genetic suppressor element screening technology, Dunn et al. identified CD74 and some other membrane proteins as essential for HIV-1 early infection (49Dunn S.J. Khan I.H. Chan U.A. Scearce R.L. Melara C.L. Paul A.M. Sharma V. Bih F.Y. Holzmayer T.A. Luciw P.A. Abo A. Virology. 2004; 321: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). They found that silencing the CD74 gene with specific siRNA strongly inhibited HIV-1 infection. This study supports our results, and when taken together, we reasoned that that CD74 is involved in HIV-1 early infection through its interaction with the gp41 loop region but that inhibition of HIV-1 infection by silencing CD74 probably results from blocking the CD74-mediated ERK/MAPK pathway. During HIV-1 infection, there are at least three possible chances for gp41 to bind cellular CD74. (i) During the virus entry process, gp41 is sufficiently exposed to enable mediation of the viral-cell membrane fusion, thus allowing potential interaction with CD74 on the cell membrane. (ii) Under physiological conditions, most viral particles are defective with gp120 shed and gp41 exposed (50McMichael A.J. Hanke T. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 874-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). As such, the exposed gp41 on defective virions might directly bind to cell surface CD74. (iii) The degraded gp41 fragments containing the loop sequence (like the peptide 6358) may also bind CD74 to activate the ERK/MAPK pathway and enhance HIV-1 infection. Taken together, we propose a model, as shown in Fig. 8. In this model, gp41, as well as its fragments, interact with cell surface CD74 and activate the CD74-mediated ERK/MAPK pathway to enhance HIV-1 infection. In conclusion, we identified and confirmed the interaction of HIV-1 gp41 and CD74, and we demonstrated that gp41 could activate the CD74-mediated ERK/MAPK pathway and enhance HIV-1 infection."
