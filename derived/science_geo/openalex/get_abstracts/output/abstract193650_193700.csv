https://openalex.org/W2003537232,"ACCORDING to Waldenström, Fink and Hoerburger1, uroporphyrin I does not pass from aqueous solutions into ethyl acetate at any pH, thus differing from uroporphyrin III, which is readily extracted by ethyl acetate around pH 3.1. This statement has been widely accepted in the literature. We have found, however, that uroporphyrin I in the concentrations studied is readily extracted into ethyl acetate from aqueous solutions at pH 3.0–3.2, and, provided these are strongly buffered, quantitative recoveries can be obtained."

https://openalex.org/W1999554086,"MANY theories have been put forward concerning the mechanism of protein synthesis, and most of them have suggested that ribonucleic acid acts as a template upon, or alongside which, peptide chains are synthesized. The arrangement of the amino-acids in the peptide chain is supposedly regulated by the highly specific arrangement of the nucleotides which, it has been suggested1,2, may contain high-energy phosphate at the proper intervals to effect peptide bond synthesis. A recent detailed account of this theory and some evidence for the phosphorylation of ribonucleic acid has been offered by Dounce1,3."

The experiments were undertaken primarily to test the effect upon microglial immigration and transformation in the brain. Hortega's neonatal ‘fountains’ were found to be completely suppressed within 24–36 hr. of a single dose of 2.5 mgm. of cortisone, and in older animals myelination was retarded."

https://openalex.org/W1977911380,"D'HERELLE1 isolated a small Gram-negative bacillus from dead or dying Schistocerca pollens Thumb. in Yucatan, Mexico. He considered this organism, which he named Coccobacillus acridiorum, to be the etiological agent of a highly virulent disease which was responsible for widespread destruction of locusts in this region. Although he claimed success in locust control by means of the organism, other workers were less successful and the method was finally abandoned. Later, there was some confusion as to the true identity of Coccobacillus acridiorum; but Steinhaus2 states that it is probably related to Aerobacter aerogenes."

The numerous synthetic analogues of papaverine (I) which have been prepared (see, for example, Blicke2) can be divided into two main groups : (1) those with an intact isoquinoline ring system (for example, eupaverine3) and (2) those in which the isoquinoline ring has been opened at the line a—a to give a bis-(2-phenylethyl)amine (for example, sestron4)."
