https://openalex.org/W4229033508,"Spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies are promising tools to study complex biological processes such as mammalian embryogenesis. However, the imbalance between resolution, gene capture, and field of view of current methodologies precludes their systematic application to analyze relatively large and three-dimensional mid- and late-gestation embryos. Here, we combined DNA nanoball (DNB)-patterned arrays and in situ RNA capture to create spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq). We applied Stereo-seq to generate the mouse organogenesis spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas (MOSTA), which maps with single-cell resolution and high sensitivity the kinetics and directionality of transcriptional variation during mouse organogenesis. We used this information to gain insight into the molecular basis of spatial cell heterogeneity and cell fate specification in developing tissues such as the dorsal midbrain. Our panoramic atlas will facilitate in-depth investigation of longstanding questions concerning normal and abnormal mammalian development."
https://openalex.org/W4229054631,"The loss of dopamine (DA) neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) is a defining pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Nevertheless, the molecular features associated with DA neuron vulnerability have not yet been fully identified. Here, we developed a protocol to enrich and transcriptionally profile DA neurons from patients with PD and matched controls, sampling a total of 387,483 nuclei, including 22,048 DA neuron profiles. We identified ten populations and spatially localized each within the SNpc using Slide-seq. A single subtype, marked by the expression of the gene AGTR1 and spatially confined to the ventral tier of SNpc, was highly susceptible to loss in PD and showed the strongest upregulation of targets of TP53 and NR2F2, nominating molecular processes associated with degeneration. This same vulnerable population was specifically enriched for the heritable risk associated with PD, highlighting the importance of cell-intrinsic processes in determining the differential vulnerability of DA neurons to PD-associated degeneration."

https://openalex.org/W3189526869,"Solid-state spin qubits is a promising platform for quantum computation and quantum networks1,2. Recent experiments have demonstrated high-quality control over multi-qubit systems3-8, elementary quantum algorithms8-11 and non-fault-tolerant error correction12-14. Large-scale systems will require using error-corrected logical qubits that are operated fault tolerantly, so that reliable computation becomes possible despite noisy operations15-18. Overcoming imperfections in this way remains an important outstanding challenge for quantum science15,19-27. Here, we demonstrate fault-tolerant operations on a logical qubit using spin qubits in diamond. Our approach is based on the five-qubit code with a recently discovered flag protocol that enables fault tolerance using a total of seven qubits28-30. We encode the logical qubit using a new protocol based on repeated multi-qubit measurements and show that it outperforms non-fault-tolerant encoding schemes. We then fault-tolerantly manipulate the logical qubit through a complete set of single-qubit Clifford gates. Finally, we demonstrate flagged stabilizer measurements with real-time processing of the outcomes. Such measurements are a primitive for fault-tolerant quantum error correction. Although future improvements in fidelity and the number of qubits will be required to suppress logical error rates below the physical error rates, our realization of fault-tolerant protocols on the logical-qubit level is a key step towards quantum information processing based on solid-state spins."
https://openalex.org/W4229000069,"Bioelectronics needs to continuously monitor mechanical and electrophysiological signals for patients. However, the signals always include artifacts by patients’ unexpected movement (such as walking and respiration under approximately 30 hertz). The current method to remove them is a signal process that uses a bandpass filter, which may cause signal loss. We present an unconventional bandpass filter material—viscoelastic gelatin-chitosan hydrogel damper, inspired by the viscoelastic cuticular pad in a spider—to remove dynamic mechanical noise artifacts selectively. The hydrogel exhibits frequency-dependent phase transition that results in a rubbery state that damps low-frequency noise and a glassy state that transmits the desired high-frequency signals. It serves as an adaptable passfilter that enables the acquisition of high-quality signals from patients while minimizing signal process for advanced bioelectronics."
https://openalex.org/W4229055861,"The ammoximation of cyclohexanone using preformed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is currently applied commercially to produce cyclohexanone oxime, an important feedstock in nylon-6 production. We demonstrate that by using supported gold-palladium (AuPd) alloyed nanoparticles in conjunction with a titanium silicate-1 (TS-1) catalyst, H2O2 can be generated in situ as needed, producing cyclohexanone oxime with >95% selectivity, comparable to the current industrial route. The ammoximation of several additional simple ketones is also demonstrated. Our approach eliminates the need to transport and store highly concentrated, stabilized H2O2, potentially achieving substantial environmental and economic savings. This approach could form the basis of an alternative route to numerous chemical transformations that are currently dependent on a combination of preformed H2O2 and TS-1, while allowing for considerable process intensification."
https://openalex.org/W4228999632,"The active chemical state of zinc (Zn) in a zinc-copper (Zn-Cu) catalyst during carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide (CO2/CO) hydrogenation has been debated to be Zn oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles, metallic Zn, or a Zn-Cu surface alloy. We used x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy at 180 to 500 millibar to probe the nature of Zn and reaction intermediates during CO2/CO hydrogenation over Zn/ZnO/Cu(211), where the temperature is sufficiently high for the reaction to rapidly turn over, thus creating an almost adsorbate-free surface. Tuning of the grazing incidence angle makes it possible to achieve either surface or bulk sensitivity. Hydrogenation of CO2 gives preference to ZnO in the form of clusters or nanoparticles, whereas in pure CO a surface Zn-Cu alloy becomes more prominent. The results reveal a specific role of CO in the formation of the Zn-Cu surface alloy as an active phase that facilitates efficient CO2 methanol synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4228997056,"International trade separates consumption of goods from related environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land-use change (together referred to as ""land-use emissions""). Through use of new emissions estimates and a multiregional input-output model, we evaluated land-use emissions embodied in global trade from 2004 to 2017. Annually, 27% of land-use emissions and 22% of agricultural land are related to agricultural products ultimately consumed in a different region from where they were produced. Roughly three-quarters of embodied emissions are from land-use change, with the largest transfers from lower-income countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, and Argentina to more industrialized regions such as Europe, the United States, and China. Mitigation of global land-use emissions and sustainable development may thus depend on improving the transparency of supply chains."
https://openalex.org/W4229020253,"In cases of severe wildlife population decline, a key question is whether recovery efforts will be impeded by genetic factors, such as inbreeding depression. Decades of excess mortality from gillnet fishing have driven Mexico’s vaquita porpoise ( Phocoena sinus ) to ~10 remaining individuals. We analyzed whole-genome sequences from 20 vaquitas and integrated genomic and demographic information into stochastic, individual-based simulations to quantify the species’ recovery potential. Our analysis suggests that the vaquita’s historical rarity has resulted in a low burden of segregating deleterious variation, reducing the risk of inbreeding depression. Similarly, genome-informed simulations suggest that the vaquita can recover if bycatch mortality is immediately halted. This study provides hope for vaquitas and other naturally rare endangered species and highlights the utility of genomics in predicting extinction risk."

https://openalex.org/W4229030883,"Controlling behavior to flexibly achieve desired goals depends on the ability to monitor one’s own performance. It is unknown how performance monitoring can be both flexible, to support different tasks, and specialized, to perform each task well. We recorded single neurons in the human medial frontal cortex while subjects performed two tasks that involve three types of cognitive conflict. Neurons encoding conflict probability, conflict, and error in one or both tasks were intermixed, forming a representational geometry that simultaneously allowed task specialization and generalization. Neurons encoding conflict retrospectively served to update internal estimates of conflict probability. Population representations of conflict were compositional. These findings reveal how representations of evaluative signals can be both abstract and task-specific and suggest a neuronal mechanism for estimating control demand."
https://openalex.org/W4229014893,"Dynamic morphological changes of intracellular organelles are often regulated by protein phosphorylation or dephosphorylation1-6. Phosphorylation modulates stereospecific interactions among structured proteins, but how it controls molecular interactions among unstructured proteins and regulates their macroscopic behaviours remains unknown. Here we determined the cell cycle-specific behaviour of Ki-67, which localizes to the nucleoli during interphase and relocates to the chromosome periphery during mitosis. Mitotic hyperphosphorylation of disordered repeat domains of Ki-67 generates alternating charge blocks in these domains and increases their propensity for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). A phosphomimetic sequence and the sequences with enhanced charge blockiness underwent strong LLPS in vitro and induced chromosome periphery formation in vivo. Conversely, mitotic hyperphosphorylation of NPM1 diminished a charge block and suppressed LLPS, resulting in nucleolar dissolution. Cell cycle-specific phase separation can be modulated via phosphorylation by enhancing or reducing the charge blockiness of disordered regions, rather than by attaching phosphate groups to specific sites."
https://openalex.org/W4229017562,"Epistasis can markedly affect evolutionary trajectories. In recent decades, protein-level fitness landscapes have revealed extensive idiosyncratic epistasis among specific mutations. By contrast, other work has found ubiquitous and apparently nonspecific patterns of global diminishing-returns and increasing-costs epistasis among mutations across the genome. Here, we used a hierarchical CRISPR gene drive system to construct all combinations of 10 missense mutations from across the genome in budding yeast and measured their fitness in six environments. We show that the resulting fitness landscapes exhibit global fitness-correlated trends but that these trends emerge from specific idiosyncratic interactions. We thus provide experimental validation of recent theoretical work arguing that fitness-correlated trends can emerge as the generic consequence of idiosyncratic epistasis."
https://openalex.org/W4229039792,"The reported toxicity of oxybenzone-based sunscreens to corals has raised concerns about the impacts of ecotourist-shed sunscreens on corals already weakened by global stressors. However, oxybenzone's toxicity mechanism(s) are not understood, hampering development of safer sunscreens. We found that oxybenzone caused high mortality of a sea anemone under simulated sunlight including ultraviolet (UV) radiation (290 to 370 nanometers). Although oxybenzone itself protected against UV-induced photo-oxidation, both the anemone and a mushroom coral formed oxybenzone-glucoside conjugates that were strong photo-oxidants. Algal symbionts sequestered these conjugates, and mortality correlated with conjugate concentrations in animal cytoplasm. Higher mortality in anemones that lacked symbionts suggests an enhanced risk from oxybenzone to corals bleached by rising temperatures. Because many commercial sunscreens contain structurally related chemicals, understanding metabolite phototoxicity should facilitate the development of coral-safe products."
https://openalex.org/W4229058687,"Heatstroke is a heat stress-induced, life-threatening condition associated with circulatory failure and multiple organ dysfunctions. If global warming continues, heatstroke might become a more prominent cause of mortality worldwide, but its pathogenic mechanism is not well understood. We found that Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), a Z-nucleic acid receptor, mediated heatstroke by triggering receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-dependent cell death. Heat stress increased the expression of ZBP1 through heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and activated ZBP1 through a mechanism independent of the nucleic acid sensing action. Deletion of ZBP1, RIPK3, or both mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) and caspase-8 decreased heat stress-induced circulatory failure, organ injury, and lethality. Thus, ZBP1 appears to have a second function that orchestrates host responses to heat stress."
https://openalex.org/W4229007625,"Deciphering the functional interactions of cells in tissues remains a major challenge. Here we describe DIALOGUE, a method to systematically uncover multicellular programs (MCPs)—combinations of coordinated cellular programs in different cell types that form higher-order functional units at the tissue level—from either spatial data or single-cell data obtained without spatial information. Tested on spatial datasets from the mouse hypothalamus, cerebellum, visual cortex and neocortex, DIALOGUE identified MCPs associated with animal behavior and recovered spatial properties when tested on unseen data while outperforming other methods and metrics. In spatial data from human lung cancer, DIALOGUE identified MCPs marking immune activation and tissue remodeling. Applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data across individuals or regions, DIALOGUE uncovered MCPs marking Alzheimer’s disease, ulcerative colitis and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. These programs were predictive of disease outcome and predisposition in independent cohorts and included risk genes from genome-wide association studies. DIALOGUE enables the analysis of multicellular regulation in health and disease. Coordinated gene programs spanning multiple different cell types are identified in healthy and diseased tissues."
https://openalex.org/W4228998748,"Anthropogenically elevated CO2 (eCO2) concentrations have been suggested to increase woody cover within tropical ecosystems through fertilization. The effect of eCO2 is built into Earth system models, although testing the relationship over long periods remains challenging. Here, we explore the relative importance of six drivers of vegetation change in western Africa over the past ~500,000 years (moisture availability, fire activity, mammalian herbivore density, temperature, temperature seasonality, CO2) by coupling past environmental change data from Lake Bosumtwi (Ghana) with global data. We found that moisture availability and fire activity were the most important factors in determining woody cover, whereas the effect of CO2 was small. Our findings suggest that the role of eCO2 effects on tropical vegetation in predictive models must be reconsidered."
https://openalex.org/W4229021218,"Antarctica's fast-flowing ice streams drain the ice sheet, with their velocity modulated by subglacial water systems. Current knowledge of these water systems is limited to the shallow portions near the ice-bed interface, but hypothesized deeper groundwater could also influence ice streaming. Here, we use magnetotelluric and passive seismic data from Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, to provide the first observations of deep sub-ice stream groundwater. Our data reveal a volume of groundwater within a >1-kilometer-thick sedimentary basin that is more than an order of magnitude larger than the known subglacial system. A vertical salinity gradient indicates exchange between paleo seawater at depth and contemporary basal meltwater above. Our results provide new constraints for subglacial water systems that affect ice streaming and subglacial biogeochemical processes."
https://openalex.org/W4229021257,"The primary aim of this paper is to provide fresh evidence by testing the linkage between renewable energy consumption, financial development, and external debts in Turkey, using the Bootstrap ARDL test (McNown et al. 2018). The Bootstrap ARDL test is desired over traditional co-integration tests due to its ability to predict when resolving power and size limitation issues, and its corresponding features, which have not been addressed by traditional co-integration tests. The ARDL testing model is employed to investigate the coefficients amongst the selected variables. The findings from the ARDL test illustrate that there is a positive linkage between renewable consumption and Turkey's financial development. Furthermore, the outcomes illustrate that the coefficient of external debt is negative and significant. The results indicate that policymakers in Turkey must use the growth of the financial sector to minimize environmental degradation by promoting investment in energy and production through renewable energy sources. Furthermore, the research suggested that Turkey's policy-makers should reformulate the external debt policy to reduce the negative influence of external debt on sustainable energy development. This could potentially be achieved by removing any restrictions on international capital flow or barriers on foreign capital and foreign investment. Hence, the findings of this paper provide valuable conclusions and recommendations for Turkey heading to sustainable and green financial sector."
https://openalex.org/W4229037289,"Acute trauma stimulates local repair mechanisms but can also impact structures distant from the injury, for example through the activity of circulating factors. To study the responses of remote tissues during tissue regeneration, we profiled transcriptomes of zebrafish brains after experimental cardiac damage. We found that the transcription factor gene cebpd was upregulated remotely in brain ependymal cells as well as kidney tubular cells, in addition to its local induction in epicardial cells. cebpd mutations altered both local and distant cardiac injury responses, altering the cycling of epicardial cells as well as exchange between distant fluid compartments. Genome-wide profiling and transgenesis identified a hormone-responsive enhancer near cebpd that exists in a permissive state, enabling rapid gene expression in heart, brain and kidney after cardiac injury. Deletion of this sequence selectively abolished cebpd induction in remote tissues and disrupted fluid regulation after injury, without affecting its local cardiac expression response. Our findings suggest a model to broaden gene function during regeneration in which enhancer regulatory elements define short- and long-range expression responses to injury."

https://openalex.org/W4229063515,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have uncovered hundreds of autoimmune disease-associated loci; however, the causal genetic variants within each locus are mostly unknown. Here, we perform high-throughput allele-specific reporter assays to prioritize disease-associated variants for five autoimmune diseases. By examining variants that both promote allele-specific reporter expression and are located in accessible chromatin, we identify 60 putatively causal variants that enrich for statistically fine-mapped variants by up to 57.8-fold. We introduced the risk allele of a prioritized variant (rs72928038) into a human T cell line and deleted the orthologous sequence in mice, both resulting in reduced BACH2 expression. Naive CD8 T cells from mice containing the deletion had reduced expression of genes that suppress activation and maintain stemness and, upon acute viral infection, displayed greater propensity to become effector T cells. Our results represent an example of an effective approach for prioritizing variants and studying their physiologically relevant effects. Integrating methods that assess allele-specific regulatory activity and chromatin accessibility in T cells identifies putative causal variants for five autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4229015504,"Comprehensive sequencing of patient tumors reveals genomic mutations across tumor types that enable tumorigenesis and progression. A subset of oncogenic driver mutations results in neomorphic activity where the mutant protein mediates functions not engaged by the parental molecule. Here, we identify prevalent variant-enabled neomorph-protein-protein interactions (neoPPI) with a quantitative high-throughput differential screening (qHT-dS) platform. The coupling of highly sensitive BRET biosensors with miniaturized coexpression in an ultra-HTS format allows large-scale monitoring of the interactions of wild-type and mutant variant counterparts with a library of cancer-associated proteins in live cells. The screening of 17,792 interactions with 2,172,864 data points revealed a landscape of gain of interactions encompassing both oncogenic and tumor suppressor mutations. For example, the recurrent BRAF V600E lesion mediates KEAP1 neoPPI, rewiring a BRAFV600E/KEAP1 signaling axis and creating collateral vulnerability to NQO1 substrates, offering a combination therapeutic strategy. Thus, cancer genomic alterations can create neo-interactions, informing variant-directed therapeutic approaches for precision medicine."
https://openalex.org/W4229042022,"How are haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) protected from inflammation, which increases with age and can deplete HSCs? Adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory factor that is not required for HSC function or haematopoiesis, promotes stem/progenitor cell proliferation after bacterial infection and myeloablation. Adiponectin binds two receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, which have ceramidase activity that increases upon adiponectin binding. Here we found that adiponectin receptors are non-cell-autonomously required in haematopoietic cells to promote HSC quiescence and self-renewal. Adiponectin receptor signalling suppresses inflammatory cytokine expression by myeloid cells and T cells, including interferon-γ and tumour necrosis factor. Without adiponectin receptors, the levels of these factors increase, chronically activating HSCs, reducing their self-renewal potential and depleting them during ageing. Pathogen infection accelerates this loss of HSC self-renewal potential. Blocking interferon-γ or tumour necrosis factor signalling partially rescues these effects. Adiponectin receptors are thus required in immune cells to sustain HSC quiescence and to prevent premature HSC depletion by reducing inflammation. Meacham et al. report that adiponectin receptors suppress chronic inflammatory signalling by immune effector cells to prevent haematopoietic stem cell exit from quiescence and, thus, protect them from exhaustion."
https://openalex.org/W4229073047,"Although terrestrial gastropods are remarkably diverse, our knowledge of them is still lacking, especially for species from the Global South. As such, new tools to help researchers collect data on these organisms are very welcome. With this in mind, we investigated Brazilian observations on iNaturalist to assess the feasibility of the data available on the platform as a basis for studies on the tropical terrestrial gastropod fauna. The observations on iNaturalist were filtered by country, Brazil, and higher taxa, namely Eupulmonata, Cyclophoroidea and Helicinoidea, yielding a sample of 4,983 observations. These observations were then reviewed in search of records of rare or little-known species, species found outside their previously known range, and interesting ecological interactions. Exotic species made up 35% to 39% of the sampled iNaturalist records. The most commonly observed species were Lissachatina fulica (Bowdich, 1822), Bradybaena similaris (Férussac, 1822), Drymaeus papyraceus (Mawe, 1823), Drymaeus interpunctus (E. von Martens, 1887), Limacus flavus (Linnaeus, 1758), Meghimatium pictum (Stoliczka, 1873), Cornu aspersum (O. F. Müller, 1774), Vaginulus taunaisii (Férussac, 1821), Ovachlamys fulgens (Gude, 1900), and Bulimulus tenuissimus (Férussac, 1832). In total, 166 observations were deemed of interest to our purposes (e.g., rare species, range extensions, ecological interactions), totalling 46 identified species and 16 observations identified at genus level. Among the selected observations, we found pictures of live specimens of species that were previously known only from their shells, such as Megalobulimus pergranulatus (Pilsbry, 1901), bringing to light their appearances in life. Two potentially new species belonging to the genera Plekocheilus Guilding, 1827 and Megalobulimus K. Miller, 1878 were revealed. Additionally, we found records of living individuals of two species that were previously presumed to be possibly extinct, Leiostracus carnavalescus Simone &amp; Salvador, 2016, and Gonyostomus egregius (Pfeiffer, 1845). We take the opportunity to discuss individual records of interest, evaluate the quality of the data and possible improvements, as well the potential and implications of the use of the iNaturalist platform for research in Brazil and other tropical countries. While iNaturalist has its limitations, it holds great potential to help document biodiversity in the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W4225264305,"Mitochondrial ATPase ATAD3A is essential for cholesterol transport, mitochondrial structure, and cell survival. However, the relationship between ATAD3A and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is largely unknown. In this study, we found that ATAD3A was upregulated in the progression of NAFLD in livers from rats with diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and in human livers from patients diagnosed with NAFLD. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to delete ATAD3A in Huh7 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and used RNAi to silence ATAD3A expression in human hepatocytes isolated from humanized liver-chimeric mice to assess the influence of ATAD3A deletion on liver cells with free cholesterol (FC) overload induced by treatment with cholesterol plus 58035, an inhibitor of acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase. Our results showed that ATAD3A KO exacerbated FC accumulation under FC overload in Huh7 cells and also that triglyceride levels were significantly increased in ATAD3A KO Huh7 cells following inhibition of lipolysis mediated by upregulation of lipid droplet-binding protein perilipin-2. Moreover, loss of ATAD3A upregulated autophagosome-associated light chain 3-II protein and p62 in Huh7 cells and fresh human hepatocytes through blockage of autophagosome degradation. Finally, we show the mitophagy mediator, PTEN-induced kinase 1, was downregulated in ATAD3A KO Huh7 cells, suggesting that ATAD3A KO inhibits mitophagy. These results also showed that loss of ATAD3A impaired mitochondrial basal respiration and ATP production in Huh7 cells under FC overload, accompanied by downregulation of mitochondrial ATP synthase. Taken together, we conclude that loss of ATAD3A promotes the progression of NAFLD through the accumulation of FC, triglyceride, and damaged mitochondria in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W4229015559,"In modern quantum technologies, preservation of the photon statistics of quantum optical states upon frequency conversion holds the key to the viable implementation of quantum networks, which often require interfacing of several subsystems operating in widely different spectral regions. Most current approaches offer only very small frequency shifts and limited tunability, while suffering from high insertion loss and Raman noise originating in the materials used. We introduce a route to quantum-correlation-preserving frequency conversion using hydrogen-filled antiresonant-reflecting photonic crystal fibers. Transient optical phonons generated by stimulated Raman scattering enable selective frequency up-conversion by 125 terahertz of the idler photon of an entangled pair, with efficiencies up to 70%. This threshold-less molecular modulation process preserves quantum correlations, making it ideal for applications in quantum information."
https://openalex.org/W4228999944,"Student Dropout Prediction (SDP) is pivotal in mitigating withdrawals in Massive Open Online Courses. Previous studies generally modeled the SDP problem as a binary classification task, providing a single prediction outcome. Accordingly, some attempts introduce survival analysis methods to achieve continuous and consistent predictions over time. However, the volatility and sparsity of data always weaken the models' performance. Prevailing solutions rely heavily on data pre-processing independent of predictive models, which are labor-intensive and may contaminate authentic data. This paper proposes a Survival Analysis based Volatility and Sparsity Modeling Network (SAVSNet) to address these issues in an end-to-end deep learning framework. Specifically, SAVSNet smooths the volatile time series by convolution network while preserving the original data information using Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM). Furthermore, we propose a Time-Missing-Aware LSTM unit to mitigate the impact of data sparsity by integrating informative missingness patterns into the model. A survival analysis loss function is adopted for parameter estimation, and the model outputs monotonically decreasing survival probabilities. In the experiments, we compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods in two real-world MOOC datasets, and the experiment results show the effectiveness of our proposed model."
https://openalex.org/W4229040981,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is an aggressive lethal form of prostate cancer (PCa). Atraric acid (AA) not only inhibits the wild-type androgen receptor (AR) but also those AR mutants that confer therapy resistance to other clinically used AR antagonists, indicating a different mode of AR antagonism. AA induces cellular senescence and inhibits CRPC tumour growth in in vivo xenograft mouse model associated with reduced neo-angiogenesis suggesting the repression of intratumoural neo-angiogenesis by AA. In line with this, the secretome of CRPC cells mediates neo-angiogenesis in an androgen-dependent manner, which is counteracted by AA. This was confirmed by two in vitro models using primary human endothelial cells. Transcriptome sequencing revealed upregulated angiogenic pathways by androgen, being however VEGF-independent, and pointing to the pro-angiogenic factor angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) as a key driver of neo-angiogenesis induced by androgens and repressed by AA. In agreement with this, AA treatment of native patient-derived PCa tumour samples ex vivo inhibits ANGPT2 expression. Mechanistically, in addition to AA, immune-depletion of ANGPT2 from secretome or blocking ANGPT2-receptors inhibits androgen-induced angiogenesis. Taken together, we reveal a VEGF-independent ANGPT2-mediated angiogenic pathway that is inhibited by AA leading to repression of androgen-regulated neo-angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4229044999,"Lanthipeptides are an important group of natural products with diverse biological functions, and their biosynthesis requires the removal of N-terminal leader peptides (LPs) by designated proteases. LanPM1 enzymes, a subgroup of M1 zinc-metallopeptidases, have been recently identified as bifunctional proteases with both endo- and aminopeptidase activities to remove LPs of class III and class IV lanthipeptides. Herein, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of EryP as the LanPM1 enzyme from the biosynthesis of class III lanthipeptide erythreapeptin. We determined X-ray crystal structures of EryP in three conformational states, the open, intermediate and closed states, and identified a unique interdomain Ca2+ binding site as a regulatory element that modulates its domain dynamics and proteolytic activity. Inspired by this regulatory Ca2+ binding, we developed a strategy to engineer LanPM1 enzymes for enhanced catalytic activities by strengthening interdomain associations and driving the conformational equilibrium toward their closed forms. Biochemical and structural characterization of the bifunctional lanthipeptide protease EryP enables identification of a regulatory interdomain calcium-binding site and leads to a strategy to engineer related enzymes for enhanced catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W4225287860,"Caveolae are invaginated membrane domains that provide mechanical strength to cells in addition to being focal points for the localization of signaling molecules. Caveolae are formed through the aggregation of caveolin-1 or -3 (Cav1/3), membrane proteins that assemble into multifunctional complexes with the help of caveola-associated protein cavin-1. In addition to its role in the formation of caveolae, cavin-1, also called polymerase I and transcript release factor, is further known to promote ribosomal RNA transcription in the nucleus. However, the mechanistic link between these functions is not clear. Here, we found that deforming caveolae by subjecting cells to mild osmotic stress (150–300 mOsm) changes levels of GAPDH, Hsp90, and Ras only when Cav1/cavin-1 levels are reduced, suggesting a link between caveola deformation and global protein expression. We show that this link may be due to relocalization of cavin-1 to the nucleus upon caveola deformation. Cavin-1 relocalization is also seen when Cav1-Gαq contacts change upon stimulation. Furthermore, Cav1 and cavin-1 levels have been shown to have profound effects on cytosolic RNA levels, which in turn impact the ability of cells to form stress granules and RNA-processing bodies (p-bodies) which sequester and degrade mRNAs, respectively. Our studies here using a cavin-1-knockout cell line indicate adaptive changes in cytosolic RNA levels but a reduced ability to form stress granules.

Activation of Gαq by hormones or neurotransmitters strengthens these interactions resulting in enhancement of calcium signals. Deformation of caveolae by mild osmotic stress disrupts this stabilization and returns calcium signals to levels observed in the absence of caveolae (7Guo Y. Golebiewska U. Scarlata S.

Additionally, when cells are subjected to either bidirectional static or oscillating mechanical stretch, calcium release through activation of Gαq/PLCβ is intact, but contacts between Gαq and caveolin are disrupted (10Aisiku O.

Biol. 2019; 252: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In separate series of studies, our lab found that activation of the Gαq/PLCβ triggers a novel calcium-independent pathway that is linked to regulation of GAPDH protein production but not Hsp90 (12Philip F.

Phospholipase Cβ1 is linked to RNA interference of specific genes through translin-associated factor X.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 4903-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cavins are a family of four proteins that regulate the curvature of the caveola membrane by anchoring caveolins to the cytoskeleton (for reviews, refer to the studies by Briand et al (13Briand N. Dugail I. Le Lay S. Cavin proteins: new players in the caveolae field.Biochimie. 2011; 93: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), Kovtun et al (14Kovtun O. Tillu V.A. Ariotti N. Parton R.G. Collins B.M. Cavin family proteins and the assembly of caveolae.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 1269-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and Williams and Palmer (15Williams J.J. Palmer T.M. Cavin-1: caveolae-dependent signalling and cardiovascular disease.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2014; 42: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)). The most abundantly expressed is cavin-1, also known as polymerase 1 and transcript release factor or cav-p60. Since its discovery in 1998, cavin-1 has been found to be a necessary component of caveola formation by mediating the sequestration of caveolin molecules into immobile caveola domains (refer to the study by Briand et al (13Briand N. Dugail I. Le Lay S. Cavin proteins: new players in the caveolae field.Biochimie. 2011; 93: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)). Several studies, including those here, strongly suggest that expression of cavin-1 and caveolin are interdependent; Cav1-knockout (KO) mice have nearly no cavin-1 expression, and cavin-1 KO mice have diminished Cav1 expression (15Williams J.J. Palmer T.M. Cavin-1: caveolae-dependent signalling and cardiovascular disease.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2014; 42: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 16Liu L. Pilch P.F.

Chem. 2008; 283: 4314-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). When fibroblasts are swelled by a 10-fold decrease in osmotic strength, cavin-1 is released from the plasma membrane as caveolae disassemble to provide more membrane area (17Sinha B. Köster D. Ruez R. Gonnord P. Bastiani M. Abankwa D. et al.Cells respond to mechanical stress by rapid disassembly of caveolae.Cell. 2011; 144: 402-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Before cavin-1 was identified as a structural adapter for caveolae, it was recognized for its role in modulating cellular transcriptional activity (18Jansa P. Mason S.W. Hoffmann-Rohrer U. Grummt I. Cloning and functional characterization of PTRF, a novel protein which induces dissociation of paused ternary mortality complexes.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cavin-1/polymerase 1 and transcript release factor promotes ribosomal DNA transcription by binding to the 3′ pre-RNA, allowing the release of pre-RNA and Polymerase I from the transcription complex (19Liu L. Pilch P.F. PTRF/Cavin-1 promotes efficient ribosomal RNA transcription in response to metabolic challenges.Elife. 2016; 5e17508Crossref Google Scholar). Cavin-1 not only plays a role in transcript release but also increases the overall rate of transcription in a concentration-dependent manner. In adipocytes, insulin stimulation causes phosphorylation of cavin-1 promoting its translocation from caveolae to the nucleus (19Liu L. Pilch P.F. PTRF/Cavin-1 promotes efficient ribosomal RNA transcription in response to metabolic challenges.Elife. 2016; 5e17508Crossref Google Scholar) suggesting a role in signal transduction. The importance of cavin-1 expression is seen in KO mice that show diverse abnormalities consistent with impaired ribosome biogenesis including abnormal growth failure, loss in fat, resistance to obesity, impaired exercise ability, muscle hypertrophy, altered cardiac, and lung function (20Liu L. Lessons from cavin-1 deficiency.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2020; 48: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Pertinent for this study are reports suggesting that increased cavin-1 expression promotes cellular stress responses to toxic agents which may be traced to binding to p53 in the cytosol (21Bai L. Deng X. Li J. Wang M. Li Q. An W. et al.Regulation of cellular senescence by the essential caveolar component PTRF/Cavin-1.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 1088-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The connection between cavin-1’s ability to regulate caveola structure and promote ribosomal RNA production suggests that any mechanism that destabilizes cavin-1’s interactions with caveolin including caveola deformation would impact transcription and transitional processes through cavin-1. Here, we show that changes in environmental conditions, such as mild osmotic stress, addition of neurotransmitter, or exposure toxins, drive cavin-1 from the plasma membrane to impact RNA transcription and two processes that regulate protein translation (i.e., stress granule and p-body formation). Our results suggest that cavin-1 molecules of caveolae act as sensors to inform the cell interior of environmental stress. We have previously found that the binding of cytosolic PLCβ to C3PO, the promoter of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), inhibits its activity to regulate the silencing of select genes and that this effect is reversed upon Gαq activation (12Philip F. Guo Y. Aisiku O. Scarlata S.

Zurawsky W. et al.Regulation of the activity of the promoter of RNA-induced silencing, C3PO.Protein Sci. 2017; 26: 1807-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Specifically, we found that activation of Gαq drives cytosolic PLCβ to the plasma membrane releasing inhibition of the promoter of RISC and reversing silencing of GAPDH by siRNA, but not Hsp90. We tested the idea that because the caveola enhances activation of Gαq (5Sengupta P. Philip F. Scarlata S. Caveolin-1 alters Ca2+ signal duration through specific interaction with the G{alpha}q family of G proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which shifts the cytosolic population of PLCβ to the plasma membrane, then caveola expression could indirectly regulate GAPDH production. Using rat aortic smooth muscle (A10) cells, we quantified the production of GAPDH, along with Hsp90 and Ras for comparison, when Cav1, Gαq, and PLCβ were downregulated. We first found that reducing Cav1 changes the level of actin and reduces the level of other cellular proteins (discussed in the later part of the article), making direct impact of Cav1 levels difficult to assess. We therefore took a more indirect approach. Because caveola provides mechanical strength to cells, we subjected cells to mild osmotic stress that will deform caveola and eliminate its stabilization of the Gαq/PLCβ pathways (8Guo Y. Yang L. Haught K. Scarlata S. Osmotic stress reduces Ca2+ signals through deformation of caveolae.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 16698-16707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We reduced the osmolarity of the media from 300 to 150 mOsm in control cells and cells treated with siRNA(Cav1) and quantified changes in GAPDH, Hsp90, and Ras levels (Fig. 1, where samples blots are shown in Fig. S1). Differences between the two cell groups were not immediate but appeared ∼12 h after continuous osmotic stress, suggesting that Cav1 impacts slower transcription and/or translation processes rather than more rapid degradation or other downregulation mechanisms. In contrast to Cav1, downregulating PLCβ1 or Gαq had little or no effect, arguing that the Gαq/PLCβ pathway is not the primary factor underlying changes in protein production. These data suggest that Cav1 levels impact the ability of cells to produce proteins under hypo-osmotic stress conditions. Expression of Cav1 and cavin-1 are interdependent ((16Liu L. Pilch P.F. A critical role of cavin (polymerase I and transcript release factor) in caveolae formation and organization.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4314-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and Fig. S2A), and so we tested whether the protein changes observed in Figure 1 might be due to cavin-1 levels since cavin-1 promotes transcription of ribosomal RNA (18Jansa P. Mason S.W. Hoffmann-Rohrer U. Grummt I. Cloning and functional characterization of PTRF, a novel protein which induces dissociation of paused ternary mortality complexes.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2855-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). While previous studies found that a tenfold change in osmotic stress disassembles caveolae releasing cavin-1 from the plasma membrane (17Sinha B. Köster D. Ruez R. Gonnord P. Bastiani M. Abankwa D. et al.Cells respond to mechanical stress by rapid disassembly of caveolae.Cell. 2011; 144: 402-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether release will occur at the mild, physiological stress conditions used here which deforms but not disassembles caveolae (9Yang L. Scarlata S. Super-resolution visualization of caveola deformation in response to osmotic stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292: 3779-3788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cavin-1 relocalization studies were carried out in intact Wistar Kyoto smooth muscle cells (WKO-3M22) which are flat and easily imaged. Cells were transfected with eGFP-cavin-1, and shifts in the cellular distribution of fluorescence intensity with hypo-osmotic stress by confocal were measured. Under basal conditions, we find that eGFP-cavin-1 localizes on the plasma membrane with small amounts in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2A). Because the additional, transfected protein would increase total cellular cavin-1 and may effect localization, we repeated these studies by first downregulating cavin-1 by ∼95% before transfecting with eGFP-cavin-1 (see Fig. S2, A and B). We then quantified the eGFP-cavin-1 fluorescence intensity on or close to the plasma membrane, the cytosol, and the nucleus (see Experimental procedures). In this case, the observations were similar with the intensity being slightly lower on the plasma membrane than on the nucleus, and no intensity could be detected in the cytosol, suggesting that endogenous cavin-1 is mainly distributed between the plasma membrane and nuclear compartments (see Fig. S2B).Figure 2Cavin-1 relocalization in WKO-3M22 cells.

Scale bars are 20 μm long. B and C, cell localization of eGFP-cavin-1 was assessed in cells subjected to hypo-osmotic (orange), arsenite (purple), Gαq stimulation with carbachol (pink), bradykinin stimulation (green), and isoproterenol treatment (yellow). eGFP-cavin-1 localization was determined by measuring the pixel intensities to coordinates to the plasma membrane, cytosolic, and nucleus compartments based on the location of DAPI and the CellMask plasma membrane stain (see Experimental procedures).

Interestingly, when cells are subjected to bradykinin stimulation, cavin-1 relocalizes to the nucleus. In contrast, when we subjected cells to isoproterenol which does not stimulate Gαq, eGFP-cavin-1 remains outside the nucleus (Fig. 2D). To test the idea that cavin-1 shifts to the nucleus when caveola domains are disrupted, we downregulated Cav1 and found that little cavin-1 is associated with the plasma membrane under these conditions (Fig. 2, E–H). Taken together, these data show that caveola deformation, as well as disassembly, has the potential to promote nuclear localization of cavin-1, allowing it to function as a transcription activator. We also tested whether other stress conditions impact cavin-1 localization. Because Cav1–Gαq interactions strengthen when activated, we determined whether Gαq stimulation would in turn change cavin-1–Cav1 interactions and cavin-1 localization. To this end, we find that addition of carbachol to activate Gαq promotes relocalization of GFP-cavin-1 to the nucleus (see supporting information) and this relocalization is much more pronounced when Gαq is stimulated with bradykinin, consistent with a high bradykinin receptor in muscle cells (Fig. 2). Note that siRNA(Cav1) does not affect Gαq levels (Fig. S2D). Additional cell images are also displayed in Fig. S2C. Because both carbachol and bradykinin can stimulate Gαi in addition to Gαq, we stimulated cells with isoproterenol, which does not activate Gαq. In this case, no shift in intensity to the nucleus occurs (Fig. 2, C and D) although it appears that a population of cavin-1 moves to the cytosol and the underlying mechanism is currently under investigation. We also found that treating cells with arsenite, which promotes a p53 response and is correlated to cavin-1 activity (25Kurki S. Latonen L. Laiho M. Cellular stress and DNA damage invoke temporally distinct Mdm2, p53 and PML complexes and damage-specific nuclear relocalization.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), also promotes cavin-1 nuclear localization, but to a lesser extent than Gαq activation. Interestingly, when caveolin-1 is downregulated, cavin-1 nuclear relocalization is more pronounced in arsenite-treated cells than carbachol-stimulated ones (Fig. 2, E–G). The data in Figure 2 show that several stress conditions promote movement of cavin-1 from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, which would be expected to increase protein production based on cavin-1’s nuclear function. However, this is not seen in Figure 1 where similar or lower levels of proteins, normalized for actin and changes in total protein content, were observed. Therefore, we investigated other mechanisms through which Cav1 would influence protein levels. In the aforementioned studies, we observed that downregulating Cav1 or cavin-1 results in increased cell death by ∼40% and ∼52%, respectively, as estimated by comparing the number of transfected to control cells in 3 to 5 culture dishes. We postulated that this increase in mortality is due to decreased transcription and protein loss caused by reduced levels of cavin-1. To this end, we measured changes in the levels of cytosolic RNA (Fig. 3A). These studies were done by isolating the cytosolic fractions of WKO cells, removing the nuclear and lipid components, and isolating the RNA after protein digestion and lipid solubilization (see Experimental procedures). We find that downregulating Cav1 by 60% and cavin-1 by 38%, as estimated by Western blotting in WKO-3M22 cells (Fig. S2A), resulted in a 5-fold reduction of cytosolic RNA, while downregulating cavin-1 by 94% and Cav1 by 74% resulted in a ∼13-fold reduction (Fig. 3A). Notably, subjecting cells to osmotic stress also reduced cytosolic RNA levels even though more cavin-1 was nuclear (Fig. 2C). We characterized relative size distributions of the cytosolic RNA populations by dynamic light scattering (DLS). We find that the transcripts effected by Cav1 downregulation are smaller in size, suggesting a higher level of processing. The RNA seen when cavin-1 is downregulated is very large, suggesting reduced processing, and the relative amount of the larger-sized population decreases with the application of stress (Fig. 3, B–E). The loss in RNA with Cav1/cavin-1 is consistent with reduced proliferation due to reduced transcription, and the shifts in the sizes of cytosolic RNA suggest that Cav1/cavin-1 levels impact RNA processing. Additionally, transfection of cavin-1 to WKO cells treated with siRNA(cavin-1) showed DLS spectra similar to control (Fig. S2F). We note that the percentage of rRNA to cytosolic RNA levels is reduced when Cav1 or cavin-1 is downregulated as indicated by weaker contribution of the 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA bands (Fig. S2, E and F). The changes in size distributions in Figure 3 suggest that Cav1/cavin-1 levels or stress conditions impact cytosolic RNA processing. To better understand these changes, we looked at the two major mechanisms used by cells to handle cytosolic RNA: processing bodies (p-bodies) and stress granules. P-bodies are associated with RNA degradation as well as RNA storage (26Luo Y. Na Z. Slavoff S.A. P-Bodies: composition, properties, and functions.Biochemistry. 2018; 57: 2424-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and stress granules are halted ribosomal RNA complexes that protect mRNA during stress conditions, such as the hypo-osmotic conditions used here (27Anderson P. Kedersha N. RNA granules.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Stress granules and p-bodies have an overlapping storage function, and both contain Ago2 (28Sen G.L. Blau H.M. Argonaute 2/RISC resides in sites of mammalian mRNA decay known as cytoplasmic bodies.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) which either stalls mRNA translation or degrades mRNA depending on the amount of base pairing between the Ago2-bound miR and the mRNA. Since both stress granules and p-bodies require RNA, their assembly will be inhibited by the reduced RNA levels accompanying cavin-1 downregulation. We first tested whether Cav1/cavin-1 downregulation changes the number and size of stress granules under basal conditions. These studies were carried out by immunostaining WKO-3M22 cells treated with either control or Cav1 siRNA and immunostaining for the stress granule marker, polyadenylate-binding protein (cytosolic)-1 (PABPC1). The size and area of PABPC1 particles were then quantified from high-resolution fluorescence confocal images (see Experimental procedures). In Figure 3F, we show a comparison of control and siRNA(Cav1) in cells under basal conditions. We find that loss of Cav1/cavin-1 results in more numerous but smaller particles consistent with smaller RNAs seen by DLS. We then determined whether reducing Cav1/cavin-1 levels change the ability of cells to form PABPC1 particles (i.e., stress granules) under hypo-osmotic stress or carbachol stimulation (Fig. 3, G and H). We find that reduced Cav1/cavin-1 levels did not affect particle formation in cells subjected to osmotic stress and produced a small increase in the number of fewer particles in cells stimulated with carbachol. These results suggest that the reduced levels of GAPDH and Hsp90 caused by Cav1 downregulation (Fig. 1) are not due to confinement of their mRNAs into large stress granules. The reduction in cytosolic RNA may result in smaller stress granules that might be missed in immunostaining studies. In a second series of studies, we monitored stress granule formation in live cells using the stress granule assembly protein G3BP1 tagged with eGFP. This construct allowed us to monitor small aggregates by a fluorescence correlation method (number and brightness [N&B]) which senses small aggregates. N&B is a fluorescence method which follows the diffusion of a fluorophore in an image series and compares the number of photons associated with this diffusion to a monomeric control, such as free eGFP (29Digman M.A. Dalal R. Horwitz A.F. Gratton E. Mapping the number of molecules and brightness in the laser scanning microscope.Biophys. J. 2008; 97: 2320-2332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This method allows us to determine small particles that might be missed in confocal imaging. In Figure 4, we show control cells transfected with eGFP-G3BP1 and subjected to various stress conditions. The amount of aggregation with each stress condition correlates to amount of cavin-1 relocalization seen in Figure 2; carbachol stimulation showed the highest amount of aggregation, followed by osmotic stress and then arsenite. When Cav1/cavin-1 was downregulated, no changes in G3BP1 aggregation were observed except for osmotic stress which showed a small, residual change that might be due to residual Cav1. These results suggest that lowering Cav1/cavin-1 levels make cells less able to adopt mechanisms that protect them from environmental stress.Figure 4N&B analysis of eGFP-G3BP1 aggregation in WKO-3M22 cells.

Here we evaluated the incidence of laboratory-confirmed rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) cases over the years 2015 to 2019, to document the epidemiology of rubella and CRS within South Africa prior to a RCV introduction. This retrospective study evaluated the number of laboratory-confirmed rubella cases reported through the national febrile rash surveillance system. A positive test for rubella immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies was considered a confirmed rubella case. For CRS cases, we reported laboratory-confirmed CRS cases collected from 28 sentinel-sites from all nine provinces of South Africa. From 2015-2019, 19 773 serum samples were tested for rubella IgM antibodies, 6 643 (33.6%) were confirmed rubella cases. Rubella was seasonal, with peaks in spring (September to November). Case numbers were similar between males (n = 3 239; 50.1%) and females (n = 3 232; 49.9%). The highest burden of cases occurred in 2017 (n = 2 526; 38%). The median age was 5 years (IQR: 3-7 years). Importantly, of females with rubella, 5.0% (161 of 3 232) of the cases were among women of reproductive age (15-44 years). A total of 62 CRS cases were reported, the mortality rate was 12.9% (n = 8), and the most common birth defect was congenital heart disease. In conclusion, rubella is endemic in South Africa. Children below the age of 10 years were the most affected, however, rubella was also reported among women of reproductive age. The baseline data represented here provides insight into the burden of rubella and CRS in South Africa prior to the introduction of a RCV, and can enable planning of RCV introduction into the South African EPI."

Using a two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) approach, we sought to compare tissue samples from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients taken from the tumor center and tumor margin. Two subtypes of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were compared. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD032736 and PXD032962 for ADC and SCC, respectively. For ADC proteins, 26 significant canonical pathways were identified, including Rho signaling pathways, a semaphorin neuronal repulsive signaling pathway, and epithelial adherens junction signaling. For SCC proteins, nine significant canonical pathways were identified, including hypoxia-inducible factor-1α signaling, thyroid hormone biosynthesis, and phagosome maturation. Proteins differentiating the tumor center and tumor margin were linked to cancer invasion and progression, including cell migration, adhesion and invasion, cytoskeletal structure, protein folding, anaerobic metabolism, tumor angiogenesis, EMC transition, epithelial adherens junctions, and inflammatory responses. In conclusion, we identified several proteins that are important for the better characterization of tumor development and molecular specificity of both lung cancer subtypes. We also identified proteins that may be important as biomarkers and/or targets for anticancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W4229077934,"This study investigated different patterns of emotional labor among community nurses in China and analyzed the relationships between the sense of career success and emotional labor.A total of 385 community nurses from Beijing participated in this investigation. Latent class analysis was used to identify meaningful subgroups of participants, and analysis of variance was used to analyze relationships between emotional labor classes and the sense of career success.Emotional labor among community nursing staff in China was divided into three latent classes: active (n = 90, 25.6%), apathetic (n = 65, 18.5%), and moderate (n = 197, 55.9%). The active emotional labor classes had significantly higher career success (p<0.05). The ""gaining recognition"" dimension showed significant differences across the three classes.Our findings suggested managers to implement a variety of measures to strengthen interventions for employees' emotional labor that are targeted to incentive mechanisms, which will improve nurses' sense of career success."

https://openalex.org/W4229027872,"Background Current information about acute kidney injury (AKI) epidemiology in developing nations derives mainly from isolated centers, with few quality multicentric epidemiological studies. Our objective was to describe a large cohort of patients with dialysis-requiring AKI derived from ordinary clinical practice within a large metropolitan area of an emerging country, assessing the impact of age and several clinical predictors on patient survival across the spectrum of human life. Methods We analyzed registries drawn from 170 hospitals and medical facilities in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in an eleven-year period (2002–2012). The study cohort was comprised of 17,158 pediatric and adult patients. Data were analyzed through hierarchical logistic regression models and mixed-effects Cox regression for survival comparison across age strata. Results Severe AKI was mainly hospital-acquired (72.6%), occurred predominantly in the intensive care unit (ICU) (84.9%), and was associated with multiple organ failure (median SOFA score, 11; IQR, 6–13). The median age was 75 years (IQR, 59–83; range, 0–106 years). Community-acquired pneumonia was the most frequent admission diagnosis (23.8%), and sepsis was the overwhelming precipitating cause (72.1%). Mortality was 71.6% and was higher at the age extremes. Poor outcomes were driven by age, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, liver dysfunction, type 1 cardiorenal syndrome, the number of failing organs, sepsis at admission, later sepsis, the Charlson score, and ICU admission. Community-acquired AKI, male gender, and pre-existing chronic kidney disease were associated with better outcomes. Conclusions Our study adds robust information about the real-world epidemiology of dialysis-requiring AKI with considerable clinical detail. AKI is a heterogeneous syndrome with variable clinical presentations and outcomes, including differences in the age of presentation, comorbidities, frailty state, precipitation causes, and associated diseases. In the cohort studied, AKI characteristics bore more similarities to upper-income countries as opposed to the pattern traditionally associated with resource-limited economies."
https://openalex.org/W4229032296,"The addition of supplemental light (SL) is an effective way to offset insufficient lighting. Although it is commonly believed that SL increases leaf photosynthesis and therefore improves yield and fruit flavor, the mechanism underlying the effects of SL on the photosystem II (PSII) apparatus remains unclear, and SL leads to high energy consumption. In order to save energy, we investigated the physiological status of the PSII apparatus, plant growth parameters and fruit parameters under two types of overhead SL with a low daily energy consumption of 0.0918 kWh m -2 . The results showed that SL significantly increased the leaf chlorophyll content from full unfolding to yellowing. However, a remarkable increase in the absorption flux per cross-section (ABS/CS), the quantum yield of electron transport (φ Eo ) and the performance index (PI abs ) was observed only in a relatively short period of the leaf life cycle. SL also enhanced the fruit yield and quality. The obviously increased ΔV K and ΔV J components of the chlorophyll fluorescence induction kinetic (OJIP) curve, along with the significantly decreased PI abs from days 40–60 after unfolding in the SL-treated groups, resulted in more rapid leaf aging and earlier fruit ripening compared with the control plants (CK). Therefore, an energy-friendly SL strategy can alter the physiological status of the PSII apparatus, affecting yield and fruit quality and maturity."

https://openalex.org/W4229050728,"This article contributes an empirical analysis of information sharing practices on Twitter relating to the use of face masks in the context of COVID-19. Behavioural changes, such as the use of face masks, are often influenced by people’s knowledge and perceptions, which in turn can be affected by the information available to them. Face masks were not recommended for use by the UK public at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to developments in scientific understanding, the guidance changed and by the end of 2020 they were mandatory on public transport and in shops. This research examines tweets in this longitudinal context and, therefore, provides novel insights into the dynamics of crisis communication in an ongoing crisis event with emerging scientific evidence. Specifically, analysis of the content of tweets, external resources most frequently shared, and users sharing information are considered. The conclusions contribute to developing understanding of the digital information ecology and provide practical insights for crisis communicators. Firstly, the analysis shows changes in the frequency of tweets about the topic correspond with key guidance and policy changes. These are, therefore, points in time official channels of information need to utilise the public’s information seeking and sharing practices. Secondly, due to changes in face mask guidance and policy, the current literature on digital information ecology is insufficient for capturing the dynamic nature of a long-term ongoing crisis event. Challenges can arise due to the prolonged circulation of out-of-date information, i.e. not strategic misinformation, nor “mis”-information at all, which can have serious ramifications for crisis communication practitioners. Thirdly, the role of traditional media and other journalism/broadcasting platforms in shaping conversations is evident, as is the potential for scientific organisations’ and individual people’s Twitter user accounts. This plurality of contributors needs to be acknowledged and understood to inform crisis communication strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4229056259,"Buffalo represent a major source of milk in Pakistan. However, production is impacted by the disease bovine mastitis. Mastitis causes significant economic losses, with Staphylococcus aureus ( S . aureus ) being one of its major causative agents. While much work has been done understanding the epidemiology of bovine mastitis in Pakistan, detailed molecular characterization of the associated S . aureus is unavailable. In the current study both the epidemiological and molecular characterization of S . aureus from bovine mastitis in the Hazara division of Pakistan are examined. S . aureus was isolated from 18.41% of the animals, and left quarters more prone to infection (69.6%) than right quarters (30.4%). Sub-clinical mastitis (75.31%) was more prevalent than clinical mastitis (24.69%), with infections evenly distributed amongst the eight districts. Molecular characterization revealed that only 19.6% of the isolates were methicillin-resistant, and four strains types identified, including ST9-t7867-MSSA, ST9-MSSA, ST101-t2078-MSSA, and ST22-t8934-MRSA-IVa. Antiseptic resistance genes were not detected in the isolates, and low levels of antibiotic resistance were also noted, however the methicillin-resistant strains had higher overall antibiotic resistance. This study represents the most complete molecular typing data for S . aureus causing bovine mastitis in the Hazara district of Pakistan, and the country as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W4229030333,"One of the most popular recommender system techniques is collaborative filtering (CF). Nowadays, many researchers apply a neural network with CF, but few focus on the neighbors’ concept of CF. This work needs to consider two major issues: the similarity levels between the neighbors and the target user and the user’s rating pattern conversion. Because different neighbors have a different influence on the target user and different users usually have a different rating pattern, the ratings directly utilized by the neighbor’s preference pattern may be incorrect for the target user. Under two main issues, we try to accomplish three main ideas of CF’s prediction: the similarity between users’ levels, the neighbor’s rating, and the rating conversion. Thus, we propose three main modules, the rating conversion module, the similarity module, and the prediction module, to solve the two issues mentioned above. The rating conversion module projects the neighbor’s rating into the target user’s aspect. The similarity module uses the users’ attentions to compute similarity levels between users. Finally, these similarity levels and the converted ratings are integrated to perform the prediction. The proposed method is compared with the current CF with friends and latent factor model using two types of datasets: real-world and synthetic datasets. We evaluate N neighbors and all neighbors on real-world datasets to prove the number of neighbor is important. Moreover, the performance of the rating conversion module is also evaluated. The proposed method simulates the full rating datasets and the partial rating dataset to compare the effectiveness of using different types of distribution and dataset size. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively outperformed the baselines using ranking evaluation and prediction accuracy on real-world and synthetic datasets. Besides, The effectiveness of using different the number of neighbors depends on the quality of neighbors."

https://openalex.org/W4229056520,"UN AIDS has set ambitious 95-95-95 HIV care continuum targets for global HIV elimination by 2030. The U.S. HIV Care Continuum in 2018 showed that 65% of persons with HIV(PWH) are virally suppressed and 58% retained in care. Incomplete care-engagement not only affects individual health but drives ongoing HIV transmission. Data to Care (D2C) is a strategy using public health surveillance data to identify and re-engage out-of-care (OOC) PWH. Optimization of this strategy is needed.Statewide partnership with Connecticut Department of Public Health (CT DPH), 23 HIV clinics and Yale University School of Medicine (YSM). Our site was one of 3 participants in the CDC-sponsored RCT evaluating the efficacy of DPH-employed Disease Intervention Specialists (DIS) for re-engagement in care.From 11/2016-7/2018, a data reconciliation process using public health surveillance and clinic visit data was used to identify patients eligible for randomization (defined as in-Care for 12 months and OOC for subsequent 6-months) to receive DIS intervention. Clinic staff further reviewed this list and designated those who would not be randomized based on established criteria.2958 patients were eligible for randomization; 655 (22.1%) were randomized. Reasons for non-randomizing included: well patient [499 (16.9%)]; recent visit [946 (32.0%)]; upcoming visit [398 (13.5%)]. Compared to non-randomized patients, those who were randomized were likely to be younger (mean age 46.1 vs. 51.6, p < .001), Black (40% vs 35%)/Hispanic (37% vs 32.8%) [(p < .001)], have CD4<200 cells/ul (15.9% vs 8.5%, p < .001) and viral load >20 copies/ml (43.8% vs. 24.1%, 0<0.001). Extrapolating these estimates to a statewide HIV care continuum suggests that only 8.3% of prevalent PWH are truly OOC.A D2C process that integrated DPH surveillance and clinic data successfully refined the selection of newly OOC PWH eligible for DIS intervention. This approach more accurately reflects real world care engagement and can help prioritize DPH resources."

https://openalex.org/W4229075285,"Inflammatory mammary carcinoma (IMC), a neoplasia affecting women and female dogs, is considered an aggressive cancer with high metastatic potential and a low survival rate. Studies focused on the tumour microenvironment indicate that the aggressive behaviour of this tumour is primarily correlated with immunological factors as well as inflammation. The objective of this study was to analyse the possible strategies used by the tumour cells to suppress the immune response in female dogs with IMC. Forty-six female dogs were divided into three groups: control (C, n = 10), IMC (n = 14) and mammary carcinoma (MC, n = 22). Clinical-pathological evaluations, survival at follow-up, immunophenotyping of leukocytes in peripheral blood and tumours, and immunohistochemical evaluation of CD4+, granzyme B, perforin and FAS-L were performed. Clinical and pathological results showed a higher frequency of the primary form of neoplasia, solid arrays of tumor cells and a lower survival rate in the IMC group (30 days). Morphometric analysis of inflammatory infiltrate revealed more lymphocytes and macrophages in the IMC group. Immunophenotyping analysis of peripheral blood revealed a higher frequency of CD8+ T-cells (p = 0.0017), a lower frequency of CD4+ T-cells (p <0.0001), and significantly higher mean MHCI and MHCII CD14+ fluorescence intensity in the IMC group (p = 0.038 and p = 0.0117, respectively). The immunohistochemical evaluation of tumour sections showed fewer FAS-L-positive inflammatory cells in the IMC group. These results suggest the important contribution of CD8+ T-cells, macrophages and FAS-L in the aggressiveness of IMC."
