https://openalex.org/W2066204526,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) have both been demonstrated to play a pathophysiological role in a number of inflammatory disorders. We recently presented evidence that PARP-1 can act as a promoter-specific coactivator of NF-κB in vivo independent of its enzymatic activity. PARP-1 directly interacts with p300 and both subunits of NF-κB (p65 and p50) and synergistically coactivates NF-κB-dependent transcription. Here we show that PARP-1 is acetylated in vivo at specific lysine residues by p300/CREB-binding protein upon stimulation. Furthermore, acetylation of PARP-1 at these residues is required for the interaction of PARP-1 with p50 and synergistic coactivation of NF-κB by p300 and the Mediator complex in response to inflammatory stimuli. PARP-1 physically interacts with the Mediator. Interestingly, PARP-1 interacts in vivo with histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1-3 but not with HDACs 4-6 and might be deacetylated in vivo by HDACs 1-3. Thus, acetylation of PARP-1 by p300/CREB-binding protein plays an important regulatory role in NF-κB-dependent gene activation by enhancing its functional interaction with p300 and the Mediator complex.

Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a widely expressed transcription factor of particular importance to the regulation of cells of the immune system (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar). NF-κB encompasses a family of inducible transcription factors including RelA/p65, RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52 (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar). These proteins share a conserved 300-amino acid region within their amino termini, designated Rel-homology domain (RHD). This domain is responsible for dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and interaction with heterologous transcription factors (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar). NF-κB is composed of homo- or heterodimers with a range of DNA binding and activation potentials. The most abundant and best-studied form of NF-κB in cells is a heterodimer consisting of the two subunits, p50 (NF-κB1) and p65 (RelA). NF-κB plays a key role in the regulation of many genes involved in mammalian immune and inflammatory responses, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar, 2Karin M. Cancer J. Sci. Am. 1998; 4: 92-99PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB has additionally been associated with neurodegenerative processes and cancer (3Ghosh S. Karin M.

Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive transcription factor complex by its physical association with one of several inhibitors of NF-κB(IκBs) 2The abbreviations used are: IκBinhibitor of NF-κBCBPcAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding proteinPCAFp300/CBP-associated factorAcKlysin-acetylation domainLPSlipopolysaccharidePARP-1poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1TNFtumor necrosis factorIFNinterferoniNOSinducible nitric oxide synthaseHDAChistone deacetylaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseCMVcytomegalovirusCDKcyclin-dependent kinaseNAMnicotinamidesiRNAsmall interfering RNAUSAupstream stimulatory activityMIP-2macrophage inflammatory protein-2TSAtrichostatin APCAFp300/CBP-associated factorHMGhigh mobility groupKCkeratinocyte-derived cytokine.2The abbreviations used are: IκBinhibitor of NF-κBCBPcAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding proteinPCAFp300/CBP-associated factorAcKlysin-acetylation domainLPSlipopolysaccharidePARP-1poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1TNFtumor necrosis factorIFNinterferoniNOSinducible nitric oxide synthaseHDAChistone deacetylaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseCMVcytomegalovirusCDKcyclin-dependent kinaseNAMnicotinamidesiRNAsmall interfering RNAUSAupstream stimulatory activityMIP-2macrophage inflammatory protein-2TSAtrichostatin APCAFp300/CBP-associated factorHMGhigh mobility groupKCkeratinocyte-derived cytokine.

Treatment of cells with extracellular stimuli including cytokines, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), phorbol esters, or potent oxidants leads to rapid phosphorylation of IκBα, which results in ubiquitination of IκBα and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome (4Karin M.

Dissociation of NF-κB unmasks the nuclear localization sequences of p65 and p50 subunits, which leads to nuclear translocation and binding of NF-κB to specific κB consensus sequences in the chromatin and activation of specific subsets of genes (3Ghosh S.

NF-κB-dependent gene expression requires growing families of transcriptional coactivators (6Merika M. Williams A.J. Chen G. Collins T. Thanos D. Mol.

The two key coactivators of NF-κB, histone acetyltransferases p300 and its homolog, the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), directly associate with the NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 (8Hassa P.O.

These coactivators are thought to promote the rapid formation of the pre-initiation and re-initiation complexes by bridging the sequence-specific activators (like NF-κB) to the basal transcription machinery, thereby facilitating multiple rounds of transcription (11Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the histone acetyltransferases p300 and CBP can modify the amino-terminal tails of nucleosomal histones, thereby altering the local chromatin structure (12Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar, 13Schiltz R.L. Mizzen C.A. Vassilev A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D.

Although the recruitment of p300 or CBP to NF-κB-dependent enhanceosomes is required for synergistic activation, tethering p300/CBP alone to the promoter through NF-κB is not sufficient for full activity of NF-κB in the context of chromatin. Several reports indicated that the combined actions and interactions of distinct transcriptional coactivator complexes and cofactors seem to be attributable to the strong transcriptional activity of NF-κB, depending on the stimuli and the cell type (6Merika M.

Poly(ADP-ribose) poly-merase-1 (PARP-1) is a nuclear chromatin-associated protein and belongs to a large family of enzymes that can synthesize polymers of ADP-ribose units by using β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as substrate (17Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1534-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). PARP-1 and NF-κB have both been suggested to play a pathophysiological role in a number of inflammatory disorders (17Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1534-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Several studies showed that PARP-1(-/-) mice were protected against myocardial infarction, streptozotocin-induced diabetes, LPS-induced septic shock, zymosan-induced vascular failure, a non-septic model of multiple organ dysfunction as well as collagen-induced arthritis. This indicates that PARP-1 has a vital role in inflammatory disorders (17Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1534-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). PARP-1 has been suggested to act as a promoter-specific coactivator of NF-κB in these inflammatory disorders (18Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Indeed, up-regulation of subsets of inflammatory mediators such as TNFα, IFNγ, and iNOS was shown to be impaired in PARP-1(-/-) mice upon treatment with LPS, zymosan, or streptozotocin (17Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1534-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 19Petrilli V. Herceg Z. Hassa P.O. Patel N.S. Di Paola R. Cortes U. Dugo L. Filipe H.M.

We recently presented evidence that PARP-1 can act as a coactivator of NF-κB in vivo (18Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Neither the nuclear translocation nor the DNA binding ability of NF-κB was affected in PARP-1(-/-) cells (18Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, PARP-1 directly interacted with both subunits of NF-κB (p65 and p50) in vitro and in vivo (18Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 953-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 20Hassa P.O. Covic M. Hasan S. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45588-45597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the enzymatic activity of PARP-1 was not required for full activation of NF-κB in response to various stimuli in vivo (20Hassa P.O. Covic M. Hasan S. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45588-45597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In addition, PARP-1 directly interacted with p300 and synergistically coactivated NF-κB-dependent transcription (8Hassa P.O. Buerki C. Lombardi C. Imhof R. Hottiger M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45145-45153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Tulin and Spradling (21Tulin A. Spradling A. Science. 2003; 299: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) recently found that Drosophila mutants lacking normal PARP-1 levels display immune defects similar to mice lacking the NF-κB subunit p50. Their results imply that the role of PARP-1 in NF-κB-dependent gene expression during immune responses has been conserved during evolution. Because NF-κB-dependent gene expression requires post-translational modifications (22Chen L.F. Greene W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), we decided to test whether the coactivator activity of PARP-1 might also be regulated by post-translational modifications. We show here that PARP-1-dependent gene expression not only requires the enzymatic activity of p300/CBP but also that PARP-1 itself is acetylated in vivo in response to inflammatory stimuli. Acetylation sites were mapped in vitro and in vivo to Lys-498, Lys-505, Lys-508, Lys-521, and Lys-524. Furthermore, acetylation of PARP-1 at these lysines is required for the interaction with p50 and the transcriptional activation of NF-κB in response to inflammatory stimuli. Interestingly, the synergistic coactivation of PARP-1, p300, and also the Mediator complex was dependent on acetylation of PARP-1. Moreover, PARP-1 interacted with and is potentially deacetylated in vivo by class I HDACs. PARP-1-dependent transcriptional activation of NF-κB was negatively regulated by HDACs 1-3 in vivo. Together, these results support the hypothesis that acetylation of PARP-1 is important for its role as transcriptional coactivator and that the different physiological functions of PARP-1 might be in general regulated by post-translational modifications in a stimulus-dependent manner.

PARP-1 Requires the Enzymatic Activity of p300 for Full NF-κB-dependent Transcriptional Activity and Is Acetylated in Vivo by p300/CBP upon Stimulation—Because the coactivator activity of PARP-1 for NF-κB-dependent gene expression is dependent on the stimuli and cell type (17Hassa P.O. Hottiger M.O. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1534-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), we first tested which NF-κB-dependent genes are impaired in freshly isolated primary PARP-1(-/-) macrophages. Primary PARP-1(+/+) or PARP-1(-/-) macrophages were treated with LPS as indicated, and the expression of NF-κB-dependent genes was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 1A). The experiments revealed that LPS-induced levels of KC, MIP-2, and iNOS were impaired in PARP-1(-/-) cells (Fig. 1A). The expression of IκBα and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not reduced (Fig. 1A), indicating that only a subset of NF-κB-dependent genes requires PARP-1 for gene induction in these cells. Similar results were obtained when cells were stimulated with TNFα (data not shown). To confirm that the expression levels of histone acetyltransferases are not reduced in primary PARP-1 (-/-) cells, we tested the protein levels of p300 and PCAF by immunoblot analysis using anti-PARP-1, anti-p300, or anti-PCAF antibodies. The endogenous protein levels of p300 and PCAF were not impaired in freshly isolated primary PARP-1(-/-) lung fibroblast or macrophage cells (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 1PARP-1 is acetylated upon stimulation in vivo and requires the enzymatic activity of p300 for full NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity. A, primary PARP-1(+/+) or PARP-1(-/-) macrophages were treated with LPS (0.1 μg/ml) as indicated, and the expression of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and NF-κB-dependent genes KC, MIP-2, iNOS, IκBα and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR. B, equal amounts of total cell extracts from primary PARP-1(+/+) and PARP-1(-/-) lung fibroblasts or primary PARP-1(+/+) and PARP-1(-/-) macrophages were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-p300, anti-PARP-1, anti-PCAF, or anti-α-tubulin antibodies. C and D, primary PARP-1(-/-) macrophages were cotransfected with RSV-nt-β-Gal (300 ng), expression vectors for PARP-1 (2 μg), and wild type (WT) or an enzymatic mutant (Mut) of p300 (2 μg) along with a luciferase reporter under the control of the endogenous MIP-2 (1μg) or iNOS (3μg) promoters; cells were subsequently treated for 4 h with TNFα (10 ng/ml) or LPS/IFNγ (0.05μg/ml/100 units) in the simultaneous presence or absence of low doses of deacetylase inhibitors (10 nm TSA/200 μm NAM). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and NF-κB-dependent gene expression was determined. The indicated activation was determined by the ratio of the relative luciferase activity measured for the promoters containing wild type κB sites (black bars) or mutκB sites (white bars) after stimulation. The ratioobtained for untreated cells was arbitrarily set to 1. Error bars indicate S.E. of three independent experiments. E and F, primary PARP-1(+/+) and PARP-1(-/-) macrophages were repeatedly transfected with scrambled- or p300-siRNA targeting vector DNA (30 μg) as indicated and then transfected and treated as indicated and described in D. The indicated activation was determined as described in D. G, equal amounts of total cell extracts from primary macrophages repeatedly transfected with scrambled- or p300-siRNA targeting vector DNA (30 μg) as indicated were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-p300 or anti-α-tubulin antibodies. H, THP-1 or Jurkat-T cells were treated as indicated with LPS (0.2 μg/ml) or phorbol ester (10 nm) and simultaneously with or without deacetylase inhibitors (100 nm TSA/400 μm NAM) for 30 min. PARP-1 was immunoprecipitated (IP) under high salt conditions from nuclear extracts, and the presence of acetylated forms of PARP-1 was subsequently tested by immunoblot analysis using anti-AcK or anti-PARP-1 antibodies.

To test whether the synergistic coactivation of NF-κB-mediated transactivation by PARP-1 and p300/CBP might require the enzymatic activity of p300/CBP, we transfected PARP-1(-/-) cells with expression vectors for PARP-1 and wild type or an enzymatic mutant of p300 along with a luciferase reporter under the control of the endogenous MIP-2 or iNOS promoters, shown to be PARP-1-dependent. Cells were subsequently treated with TNFα or LPS/IFNγ in the simultaneous presence or absence of low doses of deacetylase inhibitors (TSA and nicotinamide (NAM)) (Fig. 1, C and D). Coexpression of wild type p300 with PARP-1 in PARP-1(-/-) cells resulted in a highly synergistic enhancement of transcription regulated from both MIP-2 and iNOS promoters upon stimulation (Fig. 1, C and D). However, the cooperativity between p300 and PARP-1 was severely impaired when an enzymatic mutant of p300 was coexpressed. The most striking differences between wild type and the enzymatic mutant of p300 were observed in the presence of low doses of deacetylase inhibitors (Fig. 1, C and D). The same transfection experiments with a reporter gene under the control of mutated κB sites revealed that the observed cooperative effect of p300 and PARP-1 was mainly NF-κB-specific (Fig. 1, C and D). To further confirm these results, the same experiments were repeated in the presence of different p300-siRNA targeting vectors (Fig. 1, E and F). These experiments revealed that the presence of endogenous p300 is required for PARP-1-dependent coactivation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression (Fig. 1, E and F). Together these results indicate that the enzymatic activity of p300/CBP is required for NF-κB-dependent transactivation of extrachromosomal templates upon treatment with inflammatory stimuli. p300 and CBP are known to modify a variety of proteins, such as histones and transcription fa"

A SUMO binding amino acid sequence motif (SBM), which recognizes the SUMO moiety of modified proteins in sumoylation-dependent cellular functions, has been consistently identified by several recent studies. To understand the mechanism of SUMO recognition by the SBM, we have solved the solution structure of SUMO-1 in complex with a peptide containing the SBM derived from the protein PIASX (KVDVIDLTIESSSDEEEDPPAKR). Surprisingly, the structure reveals that the bound orientation of the SBM can reverse depending on the sequence context. The structure also reveals a novel mechanism of recognizing target sequences by a ubiquitin-like module. Unlike ubiquitin binding motifs, which all form helices and bind to the main β-sheet of ubiquitin, the SBM forms an extended structure that binds between the α-helix and a β-strand of SUMO-1.

However, these proteins are less than 50% identical to SUMO-1. The in vivo functions of SUMO-2, -3, and -4 modifications are still not well understood, but it is known that some of their differences are in localization- and tissue-specific expression (6Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 9Bohren K.M. Nadkarni V. Song J.H. Gabbay K.H. Owerbach D. J. Biol.

SUMO modifies a large number of proteins, and recent proteomic studies indicate that as much as 5% of the yeast proteome are SUMO substrates (10Denison C. Rudner A.D. Gerber S.A. Bakalarski C.E.

Chem. 2005; 280: 4102-4110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar).The mechanisms by which sumoylation regulates cellular functions are poorly understood. Current data suggest that the SUMO moiety of SUMO-modified proteins provide a platform for binding other proteins, and thus, SUMO serves as a module in protein interaction networks. Protein-protein interactions, which govern the intricate and dynamic networks of cellular functions and regulation, often involve only a limited number of common modules, such as SH2, SH3, and PDZ domains and short amino acid sequence motifs that bind to these modules (14Sudol M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-like structures are special types of modules that can be either part of a protein or covalently attached to other proteins enzymatically (15Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 16Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar). An obvious advantage of attaching ubiquitin-like modules enzymatically is gaining the ability to turn on and off protein-protein interactions quickly by conjugation and deconjugation of these modules. There are two lines of evidence which suggest that SUMO is likely to function as a module in mediating protein interactions. First, sumoylation has been shown to regulate protein interactions. For example, SUMO-1 modification of RanGAP-1 results in association of Ran-GAP1 with the nuclear pore protein RanBP2/Nup358 (17Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 18Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), and the SUMO binding motif in PIASXα is responsible for its interaction with the SUMO-modified transcription factor Elk-1 to confer transcriptional activation (19Yang S.H. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Second, the available structures of SUMO-modified proteins suggest that covalently linked SUMO and substrate proteins are structurally independent from each other, like “two beads on a string” (20Macauley M.S. Errington W.J. Okon M. Scharpf M. Mackereth C.D. Schulman B.A. McIntosh L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49131-49137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Pichler A.

Biol. 2005; 12: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).Because the SUMO proteins appear to provide platforms for binding other proteins, identification of SUMO binding motifs (SBM) on interacting proteins is critical for uncovering the sumoylation-mediated protein interaction networks. Several recent studies have attempted to identify the consensus sequences of SBM using NMR spectroscopy (22Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) or yeast two-hybrid screening (13Hannich J.T. Lewis A. Kroetz M.B. Li S.J. Heide H. Emili A. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). These studies have identified similar consensus sequences, which include clusters of Val, Ile, Leu, and acidic residues. The non-covalent SUMO binding sites of several proteins also contain similar sequences, such as in the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA3C) with the sequence DDDVIEVIDVETTE (24Rosendorff A. Illanes D. David G. Lin J. Kieff E. Johannsen E. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and in the homeodomain-interacting kinase PKM (Mx-interacting protein kinase) containing a sequence VSVITISSDTDEEE (25Engelhardt O.G. Boutell C. Orr A. Ullrich E. Haller O. Everett R.D. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These sequences are similar to that of the SUMO-1 binding site of PIASX (VDVIDLT), determined by our previous study (22Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). There is also the possibility that other SUMO binding sequences may exist (26Mishra R.K. Jatiani S.S. Kumar A. Simhadri V.R. Hosur R.V. Mittal R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31445-31454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Takahashi H. Hatakeyama S. Saitoh H. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5611-5621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).The physiological relevance has been demonstrated for the SBM that we have previously identified (28Chupreta S. Holmstrom S. Subramanian L. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 4272-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An investigation combining site-directed mutagenesis of SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 and transcriptional assays have identified a specific surface of SUMO as the only region that mediates SUMO-1 and -2 dependent transcriptional inhibition. This surface is identical to the region that we have shown to bind to the SBM (22Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Because transcriptional repression is a common function of sumoylation, this result suggests that the SUMO-SBM interaction is responsible for recruiting cellular factors that mediate the transcriptional inhibitory functions of SUMO.The SBM is different from the SUMO-1 modification consensus sequence (ΦKXE) found in SUMO-1 substrate proteins. SBM binds SUMO non-covalently, but the ΦKXE motif does not bind to SUMO-1 noncovalently. Instead, it binds Ubc9 noncovalently for covalent SUMO attachment (29Lin D. Tatham M.H. Yu B. Kim S. Hay R.T. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21740-21748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Although the consensus sequences of the SBM that are identified from most studies are similar, the consensus sequence is still not clear. In this report we present an NMR structural study of SUMO-1 in complex with a peptide containing such a SBM (KVDVIDLTIESSSDEEEDPPAKR). A combination of structural determination, amino acid substitution studies, and biochemical analysis of the affinities have revealed a novel mechanism of recognizing target sequences by ubiquitin-like proteins and have provided the structural basis for the sequence requirement of this SBM for binding SUMO.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of Recombinant Protein and Peptide—13C,15N-Enriched and unlabeled human SUMO-1 (1-97) was expressed and purified as described (22Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). 13C,15N-Enriched PIASX-P peptide was made with the modified vector pET31b (Novagen), in which 5 tandem repeats of PIASX-P peptide-coding sequences separated by methionine codon were fused upstream of His6 tag and downstream of a N-terminal ketosteroid isomerase gene. The ketosteroid isomerase gene drives the expression into inclusion bodies. Methionine was introduced at the junction between the ketosteroid isomerase leader sequence and the peptide coding sequence to allow removal of the leader sequence by cyanogen bromide cleavage. BLR(DE3)pLysS cells containing the expression plasmid were grown at 37 °C in M-9 minimal media with [13C]glucose and 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The fusion protein was purified from inclusion bodies with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. The fusion protein was then precipitated by dialysis against H2O and re-dissolved in 70% formic acid. Protected from light, the fusion protein was cleaved with 0.2 g of cyanogen bromide in 6 ml of 70% formic acid overnight in a ventilated hood and then dried by rotary evaporation. The gelatinous material was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4. This mixture was stirred overnight, and the supernatant containing the cleaved recombinant peptide was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC and verified by mass spectrometry.NMR Spectroscopy—PIASX-P peptide and SUMO-1 were mixed with 1:1 molar ratio in a buffer containing 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and 5 mm dithiothreitol in 92% H2O, 8% D2O. Two samples were made with either 13C,15N-enriched SUMO-1 and unlabeled PIASX-P peptide or unlabeled SUMO-1 and 13C,15N-enriched PIASX-P peptide. All NMR spectra were acquired at 22 °C on a Bruker 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe, processed with NMRPipe, and analyzed with NMRView (Version 5).The backbone and side chain assignments of SUMO-1 in complex with PIASX-P peptide were obtained as described (22Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Main-chain and side-chain assignments of the peptide in complex were made using three-dimensional HNCA and HN(CO)CA spectra acquired in H2O and HCCH-two-dimensional total correlation spectrum acquired in D2O (30Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were obtained from the analysis of three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY, 13C-edited NOESY, and 13C-filtered/13C-edited NOESY spectra. Main chain Φ and Ψ angles were predicted by TALOS based on Hα, Cα, Cβ and amide nitrogen chemical shifts (31Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar).Structure Calculation—The complex structure was calculated using the software HADDOCK1.3 (32Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M.J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar) in combination with CNS (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) using unambiguous distance restraints and dihedral angle restraints. The starting structures for the calculation were the SUMO-1 structure in the crystal structure of SUMO-1-modified E2-25K (1-155) (PDB code 2BF8) and the random coil structure of the PIASX-P peptide built using the software INSIGHTII (Accelrys). The binding interface on SUMO-1 was defined as residues 21-25 and 33-52 based on the chemical shift perturbations upon binding the PIASX-P peptide (22Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The peptide was allowed to be fully flexible. NOEs derived distance constraints were assigned upper bounds of 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5 Å according to the cross-peak intensities, with an extra 0.5 Å added to the upper bounds of distance restraints involving methyl groups. The lower bounds were van der Waals radii. Backbone Φ and Ψ restraints with TALOS reliability scores of 10 were applied to the whole peptide and the binding interface of SUMO-1. From the 1000 structures calculated from rigid body docking, 100 structures were refined, and 10 structures with lowest intermolecular energy were retained. Structure alignments were made with INSIGHT II (MSI). Structures were analyzed using PROCHECK NMR (34Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar).Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Measurements—The wild type and mutant PIASX-N peptides (the N-terminal 10 residues of PIASX-P peptide) were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Core Facility at the City of Hope, purified by HPLC, and verified by mass spectrometry.ITC measurements were performed at 30 °C using Microcal VP-ITC calorimeter. SUMO-1 and peptide samples were buffered with 20 mm phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and thoroughly degassed before use. The concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. Injection of 5 μlof ∼0.4 mm (for wild type peptide titrations) or ∼1 mm peptide (for mutant peptide titrations) were made at 3-min intervals into the 1.4-ml sample cell containing ∼0.03 mm (for wild type peptide titrations) or ∼0.09 mm (for mutant peptide titrations) SUMO-1. The heat generated due to dilution of the peptides was subtracted for baseline corrections. The baseline-corrected data were fit with Microcal Origin software. Experiments were duplicated.Pull-down Assay—Mutant and wild type RanBP2 domains and in vitro translated RanGAP1 were prepared as described before (9Bohren K.M. Nadkarni V. Song J.H. Gabbay K.H. Owerbach D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27233-27238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Microtiter plates (Corning Costar) were coated with 5 μg of each purified protein per well overnight at 4 °C. The wells were subsequently blocked with 150 μl of blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with blocking buffer, 5 μlof in vitro translated RanGAP-1 protein was added with 100 μl of blocking buffer and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed 3 times with 150 μl of blocking buffer followed by 4 washes with 150 μl of 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. The bound proteins were extracted with SDS-PAGE buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography using PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSStructure Determination of the SBM·SUMO-1 Complex—The solution structure of SUMO-1 in complex with a peptide that contains a non-covalent SUMO binding site of PIASX was determined using NMR spectroscopy. This peptide, named PIASX-P in subsequent discussions, has the sequence KVDVIDLTIESSSDEEEDPPAKR, which contains the SBM as described previously (22Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). This sequence was chosen because its affinity is at least 10-fold higher than other SBM-containing peptides that we have tested, although they all bind to the same region of SUMO-1. Structural studies of this peptide in complex with SUMO-1 should yield insight into how this SBM interacts with SUMO-1 and provide an understanding regarding the higher affinity of this peptide relative to other peptides containing the same SBM.To obtain unambiguous resonance assignments and conformational constraints, two samples were made, a 1:1 complex between 13C,15N-labeled SUMO-1 and unlabeled peptide and a 1:1 complex between 13C,15N-labeled peptide and unlabeled SUMO-1. Labeling the peptide was necessary to eliminate ambiguity in assigning the two Val, two Ile, and two Asp residues in the sequence. Complete backbone and side-chain NMR resonance assignments were achieved for both the peptide and SUMO-1 in the complex using standard triple resonance NMR experiments as described under “Materials and Methods.” Intermolecular NOEs were identified from both samples with either the peptide or SUMO-1 labeled with 13C and 15N, as shown by a representative spectrum in Fig. 1. Two three-dimensional NOESY spectra were recorded with 13C filtering in the F1 dimension and 13C editing in the F3 dimension. The NOE cross-peaks identified in these two spectra are mirror images with respect to each other and, thus, allowed for the unambiguous assignments of intermolecular NOEs.Intramolecular conformational constraints were derived as follows. Three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY was acquired using the 13C,15N-labeled peptide in complex with unlabeled SUMO-1. Because the peptide is small, intramolecular NOEs were easily identified when comparing this spectrum with the 13C-filtering (F)/13C-editing (F3) NOESY spectrum taken with the same sample (Fig. 1). The SUMO-1 structure was determined twice using NMR spectroscopy and three times by x-ray crystallography (21Pichler A. Knipscheer P. Oberhofer E. van Dijk W.J. Korner R. Olsen J.V. Jentsch S.

The three SUMO-1 structures solved by x-ray crystallography were in three different complexes; with E1, with an isopeptidase, and in a covalent complex with E2-25K. Despite complexing with three different proteins, a comparison of the three SUMO-1 x-ray structures showed highly similar conformations with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.4-0.6 Å among backbone atoms excluding the N- and C-terminal residues that are flexible in solution. Because chemical shift perturbation does not suggest any global conformational changes in SUMO-1 upon binding PIASX-P, we decided not to obtain the complete intramolecular NOE constraints of SUMO-1. Instead, we derived backbone conformational constraints of SUMO-1 in the complex and used the crystal structure of SUMO-1 in the covalent complex with E2-25K (21Pichler A. Knipscheer P.

Biol. 2005; 12: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) as the starting point in calculating the structure of the complex. In this structure SUMO-1 has minimal contact with E2-25K, and the interface with E2-25K only involves the C terminus of SUMO-1 (21Pichler A. Knipscheer P. Oberhofer E. van Dijk W.J. Korner R.

Biol. 2005; 12: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which is not required for binding the PIASX-P peptide.Fifty-seven intermolecular NOEs were identified between residues 2 and 8 of the PIASX-P peptide and SUMO-1. In addition, 24 inter-residue NOEs were identified within the peptide. Consistent with the previous finding (22Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14373-14378Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), the SSS sequence of PIASX-P and all residues C-terminal to the SSS sequence do not show inter-residue NOEs. The resonances of these residues are very narrow and identical to those of the unbound peptide. The sharp resonances indicate that these residues are highly flexible, and their motions are not restricted by forming the peptide-SUMO complex. Similarly, the lack of intermolecular NOEs also indicates that these residues do not form a defined structure.The structure of the PIASX-P peptide in complex with SUMO-1 was calculated using the conformational constraints described above and using the program HADDOCK (32Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M.J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). In the initial stages of the calculation, the complex was first docked using the intermolecular and intramolecular NOE constraints with the backbone conformation of SUMO-1 fixed, whereas the side-chain conformations of residues at the binding interface, as indicated by chemical shift perturbation, were allowed to be flexible. All other side chains of SUMO-1 were fixed. The peptide was allowed to be fully flexible. Two cycles of simulated annealing and energy minimization were performed. In the third simulated annealing cycle, both the backbone and side chains of SUMO-1 residues at the interface were allowed to move, but backbone dihedral restraints were applied to SUMO-1. Although the intramolecular distance constraints were not applied to SUMO side chains, the structures were well converged, as indicated by the small r.m.s.d. of the backbone and side-chain atoms from the average structure (TABLE ONE). This demonstrates that the extensive intermolecular NOEs and NOEs within the peptide were able to define the side-chain orientations at the interface of SUMO-1. No conformational constraints were identified for residues 9-23 of the peptide, and their structures were completely random. The randomness of these unconstrained residues is a good indication of the sufficient sampling of conformational space by the calculation protocol.TABLE ONEStructural statisticsNOE distance restraints Within the peptide24 Intermolecular57Torsion angle restraints54 (27 Φ, 27 ψ)Restraint satisfaction Average r.m.s.d. from distance restraints (Å)0.049 ± 0.004 Average r.m.s.d. from torsion angle restraints (°)0.690 ± 0.090Deviations from ideal covalent geometry Bond lengths (Å)0.003 ± 0.000 Bond angles (°)0.434 ± 0.004 Impropers (°)0.388 ± 0.012Ramachandran plot Most favored region (%)80.1 Additional allowed region (%)15.9 Generously allowed region (%)4.0 Disallowed region (%)0Average r.m.s.d. from the mean structure Backbone/heavy atom (Å) at the binding interfaceaComputed for binding interface including residues 21–25 and 33–52 of SUMO-1 and 2–8 of PIASX-P peptide0.45/0.70 Backbone/heavy atom (Å)bComputed for structured region including residues 21–92 of SUMO-1 and 2–8 of PIASX-P peptide0.46/0.85a Computed for binding interface including residues 21–25 and 33–52 of SUMO-1 and 2–8 of PIASX-P peptideb Computed for structured region including residues 21–92 of SUMO-1 and 2–8 of PIASX-P peptide Open table in a new tab Description of the Overall Structure—An ensemble of 10 structures of SUMO-1 in complex with PIASX-P is shown in Fig. 2A.

Here we determined the proteome of gradient-purified detergent-resistant membranes of mature blood-stage parasites and found that these membranes are greatly enriched in GPI-anchored proteins and their putative interacting partners. Also prominent in detergent-resistant membranes are apical organelle (rhoptry), multimembrane-spanning, and proteins destined for export into the host erythrocyte cytosol. Four new GPI-anchored proteins were identified, and a number of other novel proteins that are predicted to localize to the merozoite surface and/or apical organelles were detected. Three of the putative surface proteins possessed six-cysteine (Cys6) motifs, a distinct fold found in adhesive surface proteins expressed in other life stages. All three Cys6 proteins, termed Pf12, Pf38, and Pf41, were validated as merozoite surface antigens recognized strongly by antibodies present in naturally infected individuals. In addition to the merozoite surface, Pf38 was particularly prominent in the secretory apical organelles. A different cysteine-rich putative GPI-anchored protein, Pf92, was also localized to the merozoite surface.

To date, four GPI-anchored merozoite surface proteins (MSP-1, -2, -4, and -5) have been identified, and two others (MSP-10 and rhoptry-associated membrane antigen (RAMA)) appear to reside at least in part in organelles at the apical end of the parasite (6Holder A.A.

In contrast to the apical and peripheral classes of blood-stage antigens, the GPI-anchored proteins appear to be essential to blood-stage growth with repeated attempts to genetically disrupt six GPI-anchored merozoite proteins resulting in only one “knock-out,” that of the msp-5 gene (16Cowman A.F.

GPI-anchored plasma membrane proteins of many eukaryotes, including P. falciparum (17Wang L. Mohandas N. Thomas A. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), appear to be enriched in detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains, sometimes referred to as lipid rafts. To further characterize the surface coat of the blood-stage form of P. falciparum parasites, we determined the proteome of DRMs in this life stage and found that these membranes are greatly enriched in GPI-anchored proteins and their interacting partners. Also prominent in DRMs were apical organelle (rhoptry), multimembrane-spanning, and a novel set of proteins that are destined to be exported from the intracellular form parasite into the host erythrocyte. A number of new surface proteins were identified, and three of these were confirmed as merozoite surface antigens that elicit antibody responses in naturally infected individuals. This study provides a more comprehensive picture of the nature of the P. falciparum merozoite surface and generates a range of new possibilities for malaria vaccine development. Preparation of Detergent-resistant Membranes—Sorbitol-synchronized parasite cultures at 8-10% parasitemia were pelleted (1500 rpm Beckman GS-6 centrifuge), and late stage schizonts (∼44 h after invasion) were purified using Miltenyi Biotec Vario MACS CS magnetic separation columns. Parasites were washed twice in culture medium prior to saponin lysis (0.15% saponin, 10 min, on ice). Samples were pelleted at 2800 rpm for 10 min (Beckman GS-6 centrifuge) and washed three times in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES (Sigma) pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl). Parasites were resuspended to a volume of 1.5 ml in MES containing a Roche Applied Science Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet and chilled to 0 °C on an ice water slurry. Parasite samples were cooled to 0 °C, and an equal volume of chilled (0 °C) 1% Triton X-100 (SigmaUltra) in MES at 0 °C was added to give a final concentration of 0.5% Triton X-100. Samples maintained at 0 °C for 30 min (3 ml total) were resuspended every 10 min and then centrifuged at 30,000 rpm (2 °C for 30 min) in a pre-chilled TLA 100.3 rotor in a Beckman Optima MAX-E ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in a total volume of 184 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 in MES buffer containing protease inhibitors to which an equal volume of 80% (w/v) sucrose (ultra-pure, Invitrogen) in MES buffer was added. The pellet material (368 μl total, 40% sucrose) was transferred to a 2.2-ml open top thin-walled polyallomer tube and overlaid with 1.1 ml of 35% (w/v) sucrose in MES buffer followed by 733 μl of 5% (w/v) sucrose in MES buffer to form a sucrose step gradient (all solutions at 0 °C). The gradient was centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 18 h (2 °C) with low acceleration and no deceleration in a pre-chilled Beckman TLS-55 swing rotor. Following ultra centrifugation, 15 equal fractions (146 μl) were removed from the top of the gradient, snap-frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80 °C. For proteomic analysis, the 15 sucrose gradient fractions were pooled according to the distribution pattern of MSP-1200 (determined by Western blotting), such that Fractions 1-4 formed Pool 1, Fractions 5-9 formed Pool 2, Fractions 10-13 formed Pool 3, and Fractions 14-15 formed Pool 4 (pellet-associated material). Pooled fractions were diluted to 3 ml with human tonicity-PBS at 0 °C and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 1 h (2°C) in a TLA 100.3 rotor in a Beckman Optima MAX-E ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed with an additional 3 ml human tonicity-PBS (0 °C) and recentrifuged as above. Supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were snap-frozen on dry ice for proteomic analysis. Protein Digestion and Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology Analysis—Each membrane/protein pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 90% formic acid containing 500 mg/ml cyanogen bromide and incubated overnight at room temperature protected from light. 2 volumes (40 μl) of 30% NH4OH were added drop by drop followed by the addition of 3 volumes (180 μl) of saturated NH4HCO3 drop by drop. After verifying that the pH of each solution was ∼8.5, solid urea was added to a final concentration of 8 m. Disulfide bonds were reduced by adding tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine to 5 mm and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cysteines were alkylated by adding iodoacetamide to 20 mm and incubating at room temperature for 30 min protected from light. Sequencing grade endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Applied Science) was then added at an estimated ratio of 1:100 (enzyme: substrate, w/w) and incubated at 37 °C for ∼16 h. The solution was then diluted 2-fold by adding an equal volume (345 μl) of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and adding CaCl2 to 2 mm. Sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) was then added at an estimated ratio of 1:100 and incubated at 37 °C for ∼16 h. 90% formic acid was then added to a final concentration of 4%. Each sample was essentially loaded on a “three-phase multidimensional protein identification technology column” and developed with six elution steps using an HP1100 high pressure liquid chromatography system (Hewelett Packard) online with an LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo) as described previously (18McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Dis. Markers. 2002; 18: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry spectra were collected as described previously (19Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4091) Google Scholar). Tandem mass spectrometry spectra were searched against a P. falciparum protein data base (10/03/02 release, with the manually added sequence of RAMA) combined with human, mouse, and rat databases using the search algorithm SEQUEST. Peptide identifications were filtered using default settings (except where noted) using the program DTASelect, and samples were compared using the program Contrast (20Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Imaging—GFP fusion proteins for localization studies were encoded in transfection constructs under the regulation of the tetracycline-inducible expression system (21Meissner M. Krejany E. Gilson P.R. de Koning-Ward T.F. Soldati D. Crabb B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2980-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Primer sets used for the amplification of the following genes were: pf12 (5′-GATCACGCGTACCATGTGACTTAACGATGTATACAAATTAG-3′ and 5′-GATCACTAGTTTATAAGATGAATGATAAGAATGATGTGATAATAAAAG-3′); pf38 (5′-GATCACGCGTGTTGATTTTCGAACAGAAAAAGGAA-3′ and 5′-GATCACTAGTTTAAAAGTTTAAAAAGAAAAGATATATA-3′); and pf92 (5′-TACAAAACGCGTACTTTTGAACAAAAGGTACAGA-3′ and 5′-AAGTGAACTAGTCTATATGAAAGAAGAAATAGACAAGGA-3′). PCR products were cut with MluI and SpeI and were cloned in-frame C-terminal to secreted GFP. Anhydrotetracycline was removed from parasite cultures 72 h prior to live imaging (in the presence of 2.5 nm WR99210) to allow expression of the GFP fusion. Prior to microscopy, parasites were incubated in culture medium containing 100 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Late blood-stage parasite fluorescence images were captured using a Carl Zeiss Axioskop microscope, with a PCO SensiCam and Axiovision 2 software. For immunofluorescence assays, blood-stage parasites were fixed (22Tonkin C.J. van Dooren G.G. Spurck T.P. Struck N.S. Good R.T. Handman E. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and then dried onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides. Parasites were blocked and permeabilized in 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and then probed with mouse anti-Pf41 serum (1:100) and rabbit anti-MSP-119 IgG (23de Koning-Ward T.F. O'Donnell R.A. Drew D.R. Thomson R. Speed T.P. Crabb B.S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (0.02 mg/ml). Polyclonal mouse sera were raised to a recombinant fusion protein containing a 115-amino acid spacer region between the two Cys6 domains of Pf41. This region was amplified with the primer set (5′-TTTTGGATCCCTGGACACGGTGACAATACAAAAGT-3′ and 5′-ACACTCTGCAGTCCAQCGTTTTGAAATAATTTGCT-3′) and was inserted into a modified maltose binding protein expression vector, pMal-c2x (New England Biolabs), that produced a mannose-binding protein (MBP)-Pf41 fusion protein with a C-terminal 6x His tag. The fusion protein was expressed in BL-21 Escherichia coli cells and purified over nickel resin (Qiagen). Bound antibodies were then visualized with Alexa Fluor 568 nm anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 nm anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:1000. Parasites were mounted in Vectashield containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vecta Laboratories). Immunodetection of Detergent-resistant Membrane Proteins—DRM fractions from the sucrose gradient were resuspended in an equal volume of 2 × non-reducing sample buffer and placed at 70 °C for 10 min. Samples were run under non-reducing conditions because a number of the antibodies used in the subsequent western blots (e.g. those recognizing MSP-1, -4, and -5) recognize reduction-sensitive epitopes. Samples (20 μl) were loaded onto a 4-20% gradient Gradipore long-life Tris-HEPES-SDS precast polyacrylamide mini gel, spiking the first fraction with 6 μl of Bio-Rad prestained Precision Plus protein standards. Protein samples were electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore) for Western blotting as described (24O'Donnell R.A. de Koning-Ward T.F.

For immunoprecipitation of GFP fusion proteins expressed in P. falciparum, anhydrotetracycline was removed from parasite cultures 72 h prior to solubilization to induce expression of the transgene. Schizonts were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, PBS, pH 7.6, at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of Roche Applied Science Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Samples were preabsorbed with control (from individuals not exposed to malaria) IgG-coated Sepharose (100 μl of a 50% suspension, 2 h, 4 °C) and then incubated with Pool M human IgG-coated Sepharose (from individuals not exposed to malaria) (Melbourne) beads (100 μl of a 50% suspension) and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. Pool M (as with Pool P; see below) was prepared from pooled sera obtained from highly exposed (P. falciparum immune) Papua New Guinean adults (24O'Donnell R.A. de Koning-Ward T.F. Burt R.A. Bockarie M. Reeder J.C. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1403-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The unbound fraction (∼1 ml) was retained, and beads were washed 3 × 10 min in immunoprecipitation buffer (PBS, pH 7.6, containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors). Bound material was eluted with the addition of an equal bed volume of non-reducing SDS sample buffer (on ice, 5 min) followed by the subsequent addition of an equal bed volume of non-reducing sample buffer at 70 °C for 10 min. P. falciparum Culture and Transfection—P. falciparum 3D7 strain parasites were cultured and synchronized using standard procedures (25Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J.

Ring-stage parasites (∼1% parasitemia) were transfected with 100 μg of purified plasmid DNA (Plasmid Maxi kit, Qiagen) as described previously (27Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7289-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), using modified electroporation conditions (28Fidock D.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The DRM Proteome of P. falciparum Schizonts Is Dominated by Surface, Rhoptry, Multimembrane-spanning, and Exported Proteins—Sucrose gradient flotation was used to purify DRMs from schizonts, an intraerythrocytic stage that consists of maturing merozoites enclosed in a parasitophorous vacuole. The effectiveness of this approach was examined by western blotting (Fig. 1). Each of the GPI-anchored proteins examined was recovered in the buoyant fractions. These proteins were generally well separated from the single-pass type 1 integral membrane proteins, which remained in the bottom fractions. It was evident that peripheral proteins located in the parasitophorous vacuole or rhoptry organelles also tended to associate with DRMs (Fig. 1). These proteins each possess a signal sequence but do not have an obvious membrane anchor element, suggesting that they interact with a membrane-associated protein. Unlike all other proteins examined by western blotting, SERA5 and SERA6 were only observed in DRM extracts from schizont-infected erythrocytes not treated with saponin (a process that removes much of the surrounding erythrocyte proteins). This was expected as it is well known that the peripheral SERA proteins do not remain with the parasite pellet upon saponin lysis (29Fox B.A. Xing-Li P. Suzue K. Horii T. Bzik D.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Miller S.K. Good R.T. Drew D.R. Delorenzi M. Sanders P.R. Hodder A.N. Speed T.P. Cowman A.F. de Koning-Ward T.F. Crabb B.S.

Thus, the SERAs are potentially membrane-associated by virtue of adherence to protein(s) that are themselves solubilized by saponin. Alternatively, membrane-bound SERA proteases may be activated and degraded by autolysis following exposure to the extracellular environment; recombinant forms of both SERA5 (31Hodder A.N. Drew D.R.

To analyze the proteome of schizont-stage DRMs, extracts from both untreated and saponin-treated parasites were combined into four pools (Fig. 1), and the proteome of washed membranes present in each pool was determined. Pools 1-3 represent buoyant membrane fractions that the western blotting experiments in Fig. 1 suggested would comprise genuine DRM-associated proteins. Pool 4 represents material that remains at the bottom of the sucrose gradient and is predicted to comprise mostly non-DRM parasite proteins that remain with a pellet of whole parasites and/or parasite organelles that are not effectively solubilized by the cold Triton X-100 extraction. However, we did expect some genuine DRM proteins to be present in Pool 4. 94 and 70 parasite proteins were detected in the saponin and non-saponin DRM proteomes, respectively (Fig. 2 and supplemental Tables S1 and S2). There was strong overlap between proteomes with 60% of the non-saponin DRM proteins also found in the saponin-treated DRM proteome; a total of 122 DRM proteins were detected. Only high confidence proteins were included in these lists, criteria that included the detection of at least two different peptides for each protein. Proteins were ordered according to the degree of buoyancy in their respective sucrose gradients (Fig. 2 and supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Overall, both DRM proteomes (incorporating all four pools) were substantially enriched for proteins predicted to be membrane-associated by means of an encoded signal sequence and/or a transmembrane domain or known acylation site, from 24% in the whole schizont proteome (32Le Roch K.G. Johnson J.R. Florens L. Zhou Y. Santrosyan A. Grainger M. Yan S.F. Williamson K.C. Holder A.A. Carucci D.J. Yates III, J.R. Winzeler E.A. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 2308-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) to 65-73% in the DRM proteomes. As expected, the enrichment for membrane proteins was greater (75-76%) in Pools 1-3 with the bottom fractions (Pool 4) containing a higher number of apparently contaminating proteins presumably associated with poorly solubilized parasite pellet material. Among the DRM proteins without a signal sequence or transmembrane domain were a number of proteins known to be associated with membrane proteins (e.g. the mitochondrial Tom40 homologue). Thus, the vast majority of proteins in the buoyant fractions, especially from the saponin-lysed material, appeared to be genuine DRM proteins. It was anticipated that the DRM proteome from saponin-lysed parasites would include fewer contaminants because this preparation is devoid of contaminating material from the cytosol of uninfected and infected erythrocytes. Four classes of protein were particularly prominent in buoyant fractions (Pools 1-3): GPI-associated proteins (defined below), rhoptry proteins, multimembrane-spanning proteins, and proteins predicted to be exported from the parasite into the host erythrocyte cytosol by virtue of a PEXEL motif (33Marti M. Good R.T.M.R. Knuepfer E. Cowman A.F. Science. 2004; 306: 1930-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 34Hiller N.L. Bhattacharjee S. van Ooij C. Liolios K. Harrison T. Lopez-Estrano C. Haldar K. Science. 2004; 306: 1934-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). With respect to this latter group, the presence of a number of ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (RESA) homologues suggests that these virulence-associated exported proteins may largely constitute a subset of PEXEL motif proteins that are initially stored in merozoite dense granule organelles prior to their export after erythrocyte invasion (35Rug M. Wickham M.E. Foley M. Cowman A.F. Tilley L. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Analogous to proteomic analyses of mammalian lipid rafts (36Foster L.J. De Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), the fractionation procedure appears to have enriched for lipid-anchored membrane proteins, with a strong peptide coverage of GPI-associated proteins in the most buoyant fractions (Fig. 2). Good peptide coverage was obtained for known, seemingly abundant GPI-anchored proteins such as MSP-2 and MSP-4, peptides of which were surprisingly poorly represented, or absent altogether (Fig. 2, absent) in previously described whole schizont P. falciparum proteomes (2Lasonder E.

Thus, our procedures used to isolate, extract, and digest DRMs have facilitated the identification of a subset of relatively abundant proteins that were seemingly not effectively solubilized in the whole cell extracts examined in previous studies. Thirteen GPI-associated proteins were detected, which can be categorized as follows: (i) known GPI-anchored proteins, (ii) predicted GPI-anchored proteins (i.e. possessing an N-terminal signal sequence and a characteristic C-terminal hydrophobic domain), (iii) proteins that bind to GPI-anchored proteins (MSP-7 (13Pachebat J.A.

Parasitol. 2001; 117: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)), and (iv) proteins that are predicted bind to GPI-anchored proteins (i.e. protein homologues of groups 2 or 3 and the SERAs). Most GPI-associated proteins detected in the non-saponin extract were also present in the saponin DRM proteome; only SERA5 and SERA6 were unique to the non-saponin list consistent with the western blot data described above. Genes encoding all of the 13 GPI-associated proteins are transcribed in blood stages and are mostly co-regulated with maximal levels of expression late in the blood-stage cycle (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1) (4Bozdech Z. Llinas M. Pulliam B.L. Wong E.D. Zhu J. DeRisi J.L. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 5Le Roch K.G. Zhou Y. Blair P.L. Grainger M. Moch J.K. Haynes J.D.

Four of the six known GPI-anchored merozoite proteins (MSP-1, -2, -4, and RAMA) were in the DRM proteomes, and each was prominent in buoyant fractions. The absence of MSP-10 from the list was expected as this protein does not appear to incorporate into DRMs (17Wang L. Mohandas N. Thomas A. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is less clear why MSP-5 was not detected, although it is perhaps only a minor component of the merozoite surface.

Because Monarch-1 is the first CLR protein that interferes with both TLR2 and TLR4 activation, the mechanism of this interference is significant.

These findings support the provocative idea that this family of proteins constitutes intracellular sensors of bacterial products and that mutations within these genes lead to a dysregulated inflammatory response. In addition to the role of CLR proteins as intracellular cytoplasmic mediators, TLRs in mammals have rapidly emerged as predominant molecules by which the innate immune system senses and responds to microbial pathogens (22Takeda K. Akira S. Semin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar, 23Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). There are 13 TLRs that recognize an array of microbial products derived from bacteria, viruses, and fungi (24Zhang D. Zhang G. Hayden M.S. Greenblatt M.B. Bussey C. Flavell R.A. Ghosh S. Science. 2004; 303: 1522-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar, 25Vogel S.N. Fitzgerald K.A. Fenton M.J. Mol.

TLR signal transduction is initiated by stimulation followed by the formation of an intracellular signaling complex with adapter proteins, the predominant one being MyD88 (27O'Neill L.A. Fitzgerald K.A. Bowie A.G. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). An early step in TLR signaling is the recruitment of the serine/threonine kinase, IRAK-1, to activated receptor complexes. IRAK-1 activation is regulated by sequential phosphorylation events (28Kollewe C. Mackensen A.C. Neumann D. Knop J. Cao P. Li S. Wesche H. Martin M.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5227-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation of IRAK-1 is important for TLR signal transduction as it results in a decreased affinity for the TLR receptor complex and enables the association of IRAK-1 with the TRAF6 complex, leading to activation of NFκB and its functional sequelae (29Janssens S. Beyaert R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 16: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). We have recently characterized a CLR gene designated as Monarch-1 (30Williams K.L. Taxman D.J. Linhoff M.W. Reed W. Ting J.P. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5354-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), also known as Pypaf7 (6Wang L. Manji G.A. Grenier J.M. Al-Garawi A. Merriam S. Lora J.M.

Monarch-1 is expressed primarily by cells of the myeloid lineage, including monocytes and granulocytes. This study shows that Monarch-1 interferes with IRAK-1 function, resulting in the repression of TLR signaling, and thus, represents a novel negative regulator of inflammatory responses.

Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Primary Cell Isolation and Stimulation—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from buffy coats (American Red Cross) using lymphocyte separation media (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). For adherent cell purification, cells were plated at 1 × 108 cells/150 mm plate and allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37°C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline and replaced with fresh media. Granulocytes were isolated from the red blood cell pellet after lymphocyte separation media purification after ammonium, chloride, potassium buffer red blood cell lysis. Granulocytes were plated at 2 × 107 cells/150 mm plate. Cells were stimulated for 1 h with 200 ng/ml commercial LPS from E. coli (LPS 026:B6; Sigma-Aldrich) or, where noted, protein free, phenol/water-extracted E. coli LPS K235 prepared as described in McIntire et al.

Expression Plasmids—The complete open reading frame of Monarch-1 was cloned into pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen) as described (26Beutler B. Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids and reporter vectors included HA-MyD88 (33Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7065-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and ELAM-luciferase. Monarch-1 truncation mutants were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 V5/HIS vector following the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). Tissue Culture Cells and Conditions—HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 mml-glutamine, and streptomycin-penicillin. Undifferentiated THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and streptomycin-penicillin. All cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—For transfections 2 × 105 HEK293T cells were plated in 12-well plates followed by transfection using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. For analysis of TLR receptor signaling molecule induction of NFκB activity, cells were co-transfected with 250 ng of pNFκB-luc, 100, 250, or 500 ng of pcDNA3-HA vector, or HA-tagged Monarch-1, and 250 ng of HA-MyD88, FLAG-IRAK-1 HA-TRAF6, p65, HA-TRAF2, Myc-RIP1 or stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNFα to induce NFκB reporter activity. For IL-6 gene reporter luciferase assays, 1 × 104 HEK293T cells were plated in 12-well plates and transfected with 10 ng of IL-6-luc and 10, 20, 50, and 100 ng of pcDNA3-HA vector or HA-tagged Monarch-1. DNA concentrations were consistent for each transfection. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase assays were performed per the manufacturer's instructions. TLR Reporter Assays—HEK293T cells (2 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate) were co-transfected for 3 h with pFLAG-huTLR4 (7.5 ng/well), pCDNA3-huCD14 (300 ng/well), pEFBOS-HA-huMD-2 (3 ng/well), or Monarch-1 (0–500 ng/well) together with the NFκB reporter (500 ng/well) and pCMV1-β gal (100 ng/well). The final DNA quantity was adjusted to 1.5 μg/well, each with the pCDNA-HA vector using Super-Fect transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc.). Cells were recovered for 20 h, washed, and stimulated with phenol purified LPS at different concentrations for 5 h. Cells were lysed and β-galactosidase (Tropix, Galacto-Light system), and luciferase (Promega, luciferase assay system) activities were analyzed. Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Analysis— HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid cDNA using FuGENE 6. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, plus a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equivalent amounts of cellular extract were used in subsequent immunoprecipitations. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were probed with the indicated primary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce): anti-HA 3F10 (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-HA 12CA5 and anti-HA3F10-HRP (Roche Applied Science), anti-IRAK-1 C-20 and anti-actin-HRP (Santa Cruz), or anti-FLAG M2-HRP (Sigma). Anti-V-5 was obtained from Invitrogen. Generation of Antibodies Specific for Human Monarch-1 and Expression Analysis—Polyclonal antisera against human Monarch-1 was generated by immunization of rabbits with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated Monarch-1 peptide (RGQREDLVRDTPPGC). The IgG from the polyclonal antiserum was purified with protein G-Sepharose affinity chromatography utilizing the manufacturer's protocols. A mouse monoclonal Monarch-1 antibody was generated from mice immunized with hexahistidine-tagged Monarch-1 (amino acids 1–593) expressed in E. coli and purified on nickel nitrilotriacetic-agarose (Qiagen) using denaturing conditions described in the manufacturer's protocol. THP-1 cells stimulated with purified LPS for the indicated time points were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and equivalent amounts of cellular extract were used in subsequent immunoprecipitations. Immunoprecipitation of Monarch-1 was accomplished utilizing the rabbit anti-Monarch-1 peptide IgG. To control for immunoprecipitation efficiency and recovery, a rabbit polyclonal antibody for actin (I19, Santa Cruz) was included in the immunoprecipitation reaction. Monarch-1 and actin immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed 2 times in lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in 60 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-Monarch-1 and HRP-conjugated anti-actin antibody (C11, Santa Cruz) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). RNA Preparation and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated according using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR was performed with the TaqMan sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems): Monarch-1 forward 5′-AGAGGACCTGGTGAGGGATAC-3′, reverse 5′-CTTCCAGAAGGCATGTTGAC-3′, probe 5′-CCCGTCCTCACTTGGGAACCA-3′, IL-6 forward 5′-GGTACATCCTCGACGGCATCT-3′, reverse 5′-GTGCCTCTTTGCTGCTTTCAC-3′, probe 5′-TGTTACTCTTGTTACATGTCTCCTTTCTCAGGGCT-3′; 18 S forward 5′-GCTGCTGGCACCAGACTT-3′, reverse 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGG-3′, probe 5′-CAAATTACCCACTCCCGACCCG-3′. All results are normalized to 18 S ribosomal RNA internal controls and are expressed in relative numbers. Monarch-1-specific Small Interference RNA (siRNA) Construction— Wild-type and mutant human Monarch-1 short hairpin RNAs were stably expressed in the human THP-1 monocyte cell line by infection of the HSPG retrovirus containing short hairpin RNA transcription cassettes driven by the H1 RNA promoter and a separate cassette containing green fluorescent protein driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. The targeted sequences are GTCCATGCTGGCACACAAG, and the mutant sequence is GTCCATGCTAACACACAAG (siRNA#1), and GGACATCAACTGTGAGAGG, and the mutant sequence is GGACATCGGCTGTGAGAGG (siRNA#2). Promoter-Reporter Retroviral Plasmids—pHermes-κBluc was derived from pHRSpuro-GUS (a gift of H. Blau, Stanford University), a retroviral vector bearing a self-inactivating 3′ long terminal repeat (LTR) that lacks promoter and enhancer elements (37Hofmann A. Nolan G.P. Blau H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5185-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A fragment of pGL3basic (Promega) bearing the transcription silencer, multicloning site, firefly luciferase-coding sequence was inserted into pHRSpuro-GUS. This yielded pHermes-luc. pHermes-κBluc was constructed by inserting the 5× NFκB response element and TATA box from pNFκBluc (Stratagene) into pHermes-luc. Transduction with pHermes-κBluc retrovirus results in the integration of a synthetic promoter-reporter gene into the host genome that has no retroviral LTR-driven transcription, because the self-inactivating 3′ LTR, which lacks promoter and enhancer elements, determines the sequences of both the 5′ and 3′ LTRs of the integrated retroviral genome. Reporter luciferase retroviral supernatants were generated as described and used for infection of THP-1 cells. Cells were stimulated for 6 h with LPS followed by luciferase assay (Promega) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Retroviral Infections—The A293T cell line were co-transfected with pHSPG-667 (siRNA#1) or pHSPG-1504 (siRNA#2). Monarch-1-specific siRNA vectors or pHermes-κBluc and co-transfected with pVSV-G (38Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Retroviral supernatants (3 ml/well) were collected 48 and 72 h later, clarified by centrifugation, and used to infect 106 THP-1 cells by spinning for 3 h at 2500 rpm at 22 °C. Infection was repeated twice on successive days. For Monarch-1-specific siRNAs, THP-1 cells were purified to greater than 95% green fluorescent protein-positive using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and used in experiments as pools. ELISA—THP-1 Monarch-1 siRNA cell populations were stimulated with purified K235 LPS at 200 ng/ml for 24 h followed by analysis of IL-6 protein expression. The IL-6 cytokine levels in cell supernatants were analyzed by sandwich ELISA using antibody pairs and protocols recommended by R&D Systems. The sensitivity of the assays was 16 pg/ml IL-6. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection—THP-1 cells were infected with M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv. M. tuberculosis was grown to early log phase in Middlebrook 7H9 with oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, catalase media. Colony-forming units/ml were determined by plating on Middlebrook 7H10 with oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, catalase media from actively growing cultures A = 2.5 × 108. Bacilli were washed in 0.5% Tween 80, phosphate-buffered saline. Briefly, 2 × 106 THP-1 cells were seeded in 6-well, flat-bottom cell culture plates 1 day before infection and incubated at 37 °C. Bacteria were added at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for THP-1 cells. Infection was evaluated by measuring colony-forming units. THP-1 cells were collected at the time points indicated; RNA was made using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and evaluated for Monarch-1 or IL-6 expression by real-time PCR. Cytokine Bead Array—THP-1 Monarch-1 siRNA#1 cell populations were stimulated with purified E. coli K235 LPS at 200 ng/ml, with Pam3Cys at 100 ng/ml or with TNFα at 20 ng/ml for 24 h followed by analysis of cytokine protein expression. The cytokine levels in cell supernatants were analyzed by Human Inflammation Cytokine Bead Array using antibody pairs and protocols recommended by R&D Systems. Expression of Monarch-1 Is Decreased by TLR Signaling in PBMC— Monarch-1 is found primarily in cells of the myeloid and monocytic lineage (6Wang L. Manji G.A. Grenier J.M. Al-Garawi A. Merriam S.

https://openalex.org/W2085445504,"C5L2 is an enigmatic serpentine receptor that is co-expressed with the C5a receptor on many cells including polymorphonuclear neutrophils. The apparent absence of coupling of C5L2 with G proteins suggests that this receptor may modulate the biological activity of C5a, perhaps by acting as a decoy receptor. Alternatively, C5L2 may affect C5a function through formation of a heteromeric complex with the C5aR, or it may utilize a G protein-independent signaling pathway. Here we show that in mice bearing a targeted deletion of C5L2, the biological activity of C5a/C5adesArg is enhanced both in vivo and in vitro. The biological role of C5L2 thus appears to be limiting to the pro-inflammatory response to the anaphylatoxin. Accordingly, up-regulation of C5L2 may be of benefit in inflammatory states driven by C5a, including sepsis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive lung disease."

Specific mutations of Nod2 have been associated with two inflammatory diseases, Crohn disease and Blau syndrome, and are thought to contribute to disease susceptibility through altering Nod2 signaling. Association of disease with inappropriate activation of Nod2 highlights the importance of proper regulation of Nod2 activity. However, little is known about specific regulation of the Nod2 pathway. We performed a biochemical screen to discover potential regulators of Nod2 and identified Erbin, a protein involved in cell polarity, receptor localization, and regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, as a novel Nod2-interacting protein. In our studies, we demonstrate specific interaction of Erbin and Nod2 both in vitro and in vivo and characterize the regions required for interaction in both proteins. We found that Nod2-dependent activation of NF-κB and cytokine secretion is inhibited by Erbin overexpression, whereas Erbin-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts show an increased sensitivity to muramyl dipeptide. These studies identify Erbin as a regulator of Nod2 signaling and demonstrate a novel role for Erbin in inflammatory responses.

The immune system has evolved many mechanisms to identify, neutralize, and destroy pathogens. On the front line of defense against these microbial invaders is the innate immune system, a broad specificity inflammatory response that includes the activation and recruitment of phagocytic cells to sites of infection. Specialized molecules of the innate immune system, called pattern recognition molecules (PRMs), 2The abbreviations used are: PRMpattern recognition moleculeTLRToll-like receptorNODnucleotide-binding oligomerization domainCARDcaspase recruitment domainLRRleucine-rich repeatMDPmuramyl dipeptideMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseCDCrohn diseaseBSBlau syndromeMEFmouse embryo fibroblastLPSlipopolysaccharideTNFtumor necrosis factorTAPtandem affinity purificationMCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1HAhemagglutininEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: PRMpattern recognition moleculeTLRToll-like receptorNODnucleotide-binding oligomerization domainCARDcaspase recruitment domainLRRleucine-rich repeatMDPmuramyl dipeptideMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseCDCrohn diseaseBSBlau syndromeMEFmouse embryo fibroblastLPSlipopolysaccharideTNFtumor necrosis factorTAPtandem affinity purificationMCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1HAhemagglutininEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein. recognize conserved components of microorganisms that are not found in the host, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and stimulate the innate immune response. There are several families of PRMs that include scavenger receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing proteins (NODs). These different families of PRMs act at distinct cellular locations, with secreted scavenger receptors in the extracellular space, transmembrane TLRs functioning at both the plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles, and cytosolic NODs sensing the intracellular environment (1Inohara N. Chamaillard M. McDonald C. Nunez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 2Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev.

Nod2 is a member of a family of over 20 cytosolic proteins characterized by the presence of a conserved NOD (1Inohara N. Chamaillard M. McDonald C. Nunez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). These proteins contain an amino-terminal effector-binding region that consists of protein-protein interaction domains including caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), pyrin, and baculovirus inhibitor repeat domains, a central NOD that acts to oligomerize these proteins, and carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that are required to detect ligands. These molecules are thought to play key roles in pathogen defense through sensing bacteria and generating an inflammatory immune response. Nod2 detects bacteria by recognizing a specific component of the peptidoglycan cell wall, muramyl dipeptide (MDP) (3Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Viala J. Chamaillard M. Labigne A. Thomas G.

Stimulation of Nod2 by MDP is thought to cause the oligomerization of Nod2 and the recruitment of a protein kinase RICK (also called RIP2, RIPK2, or CARDIAK). The recruitment of RICK to Nod2 activates downstream signaling pathways such as the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways (5Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D.

One of these diseases, Crohn disease (CD), is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation localized primarily to the ileum. Two missense mutations in NOD2, R702W and G908R, as well as a frameshift mutation, L1007fsinsC, are the main NOD2 mutations associated with CD.

The association of both loss-of-function and gain-of-function Nod2 mutations with inflammatory disease highlights the importance of proper regulation of Nod2 signaling. To date, there is little known about the regulation of the Nod2 signaling pathway. To identify potential protein regulators of Nod2, we performed a biochemical screen to isolate Nod2-interacting proteins. In this screen, we identified Erbin as a novel Nod2-interacting protein. Erbin has been previously shown to play roles in cell polarity, receptor localization, specialized cell-cell contacts, and regulation of MAPK signaling (20Kolch W. Science STKE. 2003; 199: pe37Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that Erbin binds specifically to Nod2 and inhibits Nod2-dependent NF-κB signaling in response to MDP stimulation. These results identify a novel regulator of Nod2 signaling and uncover a role for Erbin in inflammatory responses.

Briefly, the cell lysates were made from HEK293-TAP and HEK293-TAP-Nod2 cells using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 142 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1× Roche Applied Science Complete protease inhibitor mixture). The cell lysates were bound to 400 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences 6 FastFlow beads) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by washing with 60 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and elution with 0.5%SDS. Eluted proteins were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, trypsin-digested, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectral analysis at the University of Victoria BC Proteomics Centre. Immunoprecipitation—Lysates were made from cells using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and precleared by incubation with recombinant protein G-Sepharose 4B (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C. Precleared lysates were incubated with immunoprecipitating antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by collection of antibody-protein complexes with protein G-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed six times in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—L40 yeast were transformed with the LexA bait plasmid pBTM116-Erbin and a GAL4 prey plasmid, pACT2, pACT2-PKP4, or pACT2-Nod2, using the S.c. EasyComp Transformation kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transformants were plated on SD-Leu-Trp or SD-Leu-Trp-His plates for identification of positive interactions.

Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays—The cells were plated 4 × 104 cells/ml in 24-well plates and transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine PLUS according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were stimulated for 16-18 h with 100 ng/ml MDP and then lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity (29Inohara N. Koseki T.

The luciferase values were normalized to transfection efficiency by dividing by the raw luciferase values by the β-galactosidase values. The averages and standard deviations were calculated from triplicate wells using Microsoft Excel. Enzyme-linked Immunoabsorbant Assay—MEFs were plated 104 cells/well in 24-well plates, infected with retrovirus for 30 h, and then stimulated with ligand for 16-18 h. MEF-Nod2 stable cell lines were plated at 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and transfected with plasmid using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 16 h post-transfection MEF-Nod2 cells were stimulated with ligand for 8 h. Tissue culture supernatants were collected, and cytokine levels were assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions (R & D Biosystems). The averages, standard deviations, and statistical significance assessed by two-tailed Student's t test were calculated using Microsoft Excel software. Identification of Erbin as a Nod2-interacting Protein—We performed a biochemical screen to identify Nod2-interacting proteins that may function as regulators of Nod2 signaling. In this screen, Nod2-containing complexes were purified from lysates of a HEK293 cell line expressing a tandem affinity tagged Nod2 (HEK293:TAP-Nod2) by affinity chromatography. The Nod2 co-purifying proteins were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy. Lysates from a HEK293 cell line expressing the affinity tag only (HEK293:TAP) were processed in the same manner as a control for nonspecific binding of proteins during the purification process. Nod2-interacting protein candidates were determined by comparing the peptide profiles from the HEK293:TAP-Nod2 and HEK293:TAP purifications, and proteins that were identified by multiple distinct peptides were considered as candidates. One Nod2-interacting protein candidate was identified by seven distinct peptides broadly distributed over the protein sequence (Fig. 1A). This candidate, Erbin (also called Erbb2ip or densin-180-like protein), was originally identified as a protein that is required for proper localization of the receptor ErbB2 to the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells (21Borg J.P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The interaction of Erbin and Nod2 was confirmed through both in vitro and in vivo assays. First, we assessed the interaction of Erbin and FLAG-tagged Nod2 (FLAG-Nod2) from lysates of transiently transfected HEK293T cells by co-immunoprecipitation assays. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with either an anti-FLAG or anti-Erbin antibody and analyzed by Western blot. The results of this assay demonstrated that endogenous Erbin protein co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Nod2, as well as the converse, where FLAG-Nod2 was pulled down with Erbin in an immunoprecipitation with an anti-Erbin antibody (Fig. 1B). Next, we detected interaction of the endogenous Nod2 and Erbin from lysates of a colon epithelial cell line. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Nod2 from SW480 cell lysates co-immunoprecipitated endogenous Erbin (Fig. 1C). In addition, we demonstrated interaction of these proteins in a yeast two-hybrid assay using full-length Erbin as bait. Erbin was found to specifically interact with full-length Nod2, although this interaction was weaker than the interaction with a known binding partner of Erbin, PKP4 (plakophilin-4 or p0071) (Fig. 1D). Finally, we assessed the subcellular localization of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged Nod2 and endogenous Erbin in polarized Caco2 epithelial cells and found that Nod2 and Erbin co-localize at the basolateral membrane (Fig. 1E). These results confirm that Erbin is a genuine Nod2-interacting protein. Specificity of Erbin Interaction with Nod2—To determine the specificity of the interaction of Erbin with Nod2, the ability of different NOD family members to co-immunoprecipitate Erbin was assessed by Western blot (Fig. 2). Myc-tagged Erbin and the NOD family members Apaf-1, Nod1, Nod2, Ipaf, and Cryopyrin were expressed in HEK293T cells, and the NOD family members were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. The association of Erbin with NOD proteins was detected by Western blot analysis. Nod2 was the only NOD family member that interacted with Myc-Erbin in this assay, demonstrating that Erbin binds specifically to Nod2. Identification of Regions Required for Nod2-Erbin Interaction—The regions of interaction between Nod2 and Erbin were mapped using deletion constructs of the two proteins in co-immunoprecipitation assays. Nod2 has three distinct domain regions, the CARDs, NOD, and LRRs. All of the Nod2 constructs that contained the CARDs were able to co-immunoprecipitate full-length Myc-Erbin, whereas the NOD or LRR domains alone were not sufficient to pull down Myc-Erbin (Fig. 3A). Expression of the CARDs construct at high levels is toxic to cells. Therefore, the reduction in the total amount of Erbin pulled down by this construct relative to the other CARD-containing constructs is due to the lower level of expression rather than a decreased affinity of binding to the CARDs alone.

Whereas most studies have examined overexpressed TRPC channels, we used molecular, biochemical, and electrophysiological approaches to assess the expression and function of endogenous TRPC channels in A7r5 smooth muscle cells. Real time PCR and Western analyses reveal TRPC6 as the only member of the diacylglycerol-responsive TRPC3/6/7 subfamily of channels expressed at significant levels in A7r5 cells. TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 were also abundant. An outwardly rectifying, nonselective cation current was activated by phospholipase C-coupled vasopressin receptor activation or by the diacylglycerol analogue, oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG). Introduction of TRPC6 small interfering RNA sequences into A7r5 cells by electroporation led to 90% reduction of TRPC6 transcript and 80% reduction of TRPC6 protein without any detectable compensatory changes in the expression of other TRPC channels. The OAG-activated nonselective cation current was similarly reduced by TRPC6 RNA interference. Intracellular Ca2+ measurements using fura-2 revealed that thapsigargin-induced store-operated Ca2+ entry was unaffected by TRPC6 knockdown, whereas vasopressin-induced Ca2+ entry was suppressed by more than 50%. In contrast, OAG-induced Ca2+ transients were unaffected by TRPC6 knockdown. Nevertheless, OAG-induced Ca2+ entry bore the hallmarks of TRPC6 function; it was inhibited by protein kinase C and blocked by the Src-kinase inhibitor, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2). Importantly, OAG-induced Ca2+ entry was blocked by the potent L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor, *nimodipine. Thus, TRPC6 activation probably results primarily in Na ion entry and depolarization, leading to activation of L-type channels as the mediators of Ca2+ entry. Calculations reveal that even 90% reduction of TRPC6 channels would allow depolarization sufficient to activate L-type channels. This tight coupling between TRPC6 and L-type channels is probably important in mediating smooth muscle cell membrane potential and muscle contraction.

DAG also activates TRPC2 channels; however, this channel is not expressed in higher mammals and is restricted mostly to the vomeronasal organ (12Lucas P. Ukhanov K. Leinders-Zufall T. Zufall F. Neuron. 2003; 40: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). As a product of receptor-induced PLC activation, DAG is an obvious mediator of TRPC channel activation. However, its role in the activation of endogenously expressed TRPC3/6/7 channels is uncertain (7Dietrich A. Mederos Y.S. Kalwa H. Storch U. Gudermann T. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch.

For example, considering that TRPC channels probably function as tetramers (4Montell C. Sci. STKE 2005,. 2005; : RE3Google Scholar, 5Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar), overexpression may result in a predominance of homotetrameric structures, whereas endogenous expression may reflect heteromers between TRPC channel subtypes, resulting in quite different properties (2Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B.

Hence, there is a need to examine the activation and function of endogenously expressed TRPC channels. canonical transient receptor potential vasopressin phospholipase C protein kinase C inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate diacylglycerol oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine short interfering RNA sequence RNA interference. Whereas TRPC channels are ubiquitously expressed among cell types, there are surprisingly few reports describing the functional role of native TRPC channels. For example, TRPC3 channels are highly expressed in pontine neurons and mediate a nonselective cation current in response to the neurotrophin receptor, TrkB (19Li H.-S. Xu X.-Z.S. Montell C. Neuron. 1999; 24: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). TRPC2 channels appear to mediate the primary electrical response to pheromones in the vomeronasal organ of most mammals except higher primates (12Lucas P. Ukhanov K. Leinders-Zufall T. Zufall F. Neuron. 2003; 40: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The TRPC6 channel is highly expressed in a number of different smooth muscle cell types (20Inoue R.

In primary portal vein myocytes, current closely corresponding to overexpressed TRPC6 channels was reduced by treatment with TRPC6 antisense oligonucleotides (20Inoue R. Okada T. Onoue H. Hara Y. Shimizu S. Naitoh S. Ito Y. Mori Y. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of TRPC6 by antisense sequences in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulted in reduction of store-operated Ca2+ entry (21Yu Y. Sweeney M. Zhang S. Platoshyn O. Landsberg J. Rothman A. Yuan J.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C316-C330Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Using the clonal A7r5 aortic-derived smooth muscle cell line, Jung et al. (22Jung S. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) described a TRPC6-like current activated by the permeant diacylglycerol analogue, oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG). In this case, the current was enhanced by PLC-coupled receptor activation but was not modified by Ca2+ store depletion (22Jung S. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In recent studies using TRPC6 knockout mice, a phenotype of increased arterial blood pressure, augmented arterial tone, and enhanced agonist- and DAG-induced current in smooth muscle was observed (6Freichel M.

Whereas such knockout would be expected to prevent rather than augment the Ca2+-mediated responses, there appeared to be an overcompensatory increase in expression of the closely related TRPC3 channel (6Freichel M. Vennekens R. Olausson J. Hoffmann M. Muller C. Stolz S. Scheunemann J. Weissgerber P. Flockerzi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The primary role of Ca2+ entry in controlling smooth muscle contraction and the possible role of TRPC channels in these responses prompted us to examine the presence and possible function of TRPC channels using A7r5 cells. A careful examination of the expression of TRPC channels at both transcript and protein levels reveals that, of the closely rated TRPC3/6/7 subfamily members, only TRPC6 channels are detected. This provides a system in which the function of endogenously expressed TRPC6 channels can be examined in relative isolation from the other subfamily members, TRPC3 and TRPC7. Using an RNAi knockdown approach, we have identified TRPC6 channel function in A7r5 cells and reveal that the channel may be more important as a mediator of Na+ ion entry resulting in the activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry channels. Cells and RNAi—Rat aortic smooth muscle A7r5 cells, passage 10–25, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin, and streptomycin as described previously (17Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B.

Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10997-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For TRPC6 knockdown studies, A7r5 cells were mixed with 200 nm TRPC6 siRNA (GCAGCAUCAUUCAUUGCAAGAUUUA or GGAAUAUGCUUGACUUUGGAAUGUU) or a control sequence (GCAACUAACUUCGUUAGAAUCGUUA), each with its complementary sequence. We used Stealth (Invitrogen) siRNA sequences developed to eliminate nonspecific stress responses of the PKR/interferon pathway induced by siRNA. Cells together with siRNA sequences were electroporated using the Gene Pulser II electroporation system (Bio-Rad) at 350 V, 960 microfarads, and infinite resistance. After a 3-h recovery period in serum-free Opti-MEM, 10% fetal bovine serum was added, and cells were incubated for 40 h on coverslips before fura-2 imaging of electrophysiology measurements was undertaken. Real Time PCR—Real time quantitative PCR was performed in a Sequence Detector System (ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System and software; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Amplification was performed in a final volume of 25 μl, containing 30 ng of cDNA from the reverse transcribed reaction, primer mixture (0.3 μm each of sense and antisense primers), and 12.5 μl 2× SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The oligonucleotide primers shown in TABLE ONE were designed using Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems). The standard amplification program included 40 cycles of two steps, each comprising heating to 95 °C and heating to 60 °C. Fluorescent product was detected at the last step of each cycle. In order to verify the purity of the products, a melting curve was produced after each run. To determine the relative quantitation of gene expression, the comparative threshold cycle method (ΔCT) was used (26Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). To control for variation in RNA quantity and quality, we used 18 S ribosome RNA as an internal control to calculate a relative Ct for the target molecules (TRPC channels) of interest. Subtracting the CT of the housekeeping gene from the CT of the gene of interest yields the ΔCT. A serially diluted positive control sample (rat brain) was analyzed by linear regression to determine the sensitivity and linearity of the assay. The final mRNA levels were normalized according to their Ct values from the standard curves.TABLE ONEOligonucleotide sequences of primers used for real time reverse transcription-PCRTargetGenBank™ accession numberOrientationSequence (5′-3′)Predicted sizeNucleotide locationbpTRPC1AF061266ForwardCGACACCTTCCACTCGTTCA641716-1780ReverseGCGCTAAGGAGAAGATGTACCAGATRPC2NM017011ForwardGTTCCAGTTTCTCTTCTGGACCAT1901804-1994ReverseCAGCATCGTCCTCGATCTTCTTRPC3AB022331ForwardCATGCAGTGCAAAGACTTCGTAG74531-605ReverseTTCAGAATGGCTTCCACCTCTTTRPC4NM_080396ForwardCTCTGCAGATATCTCTGGGAAGAAT671514-1581ReverseCACGAGGCAGTATATGAATAAGAACTTTTRPC5AY064411ForwardTGAAACCCTTCAGTCACTCTTCTG1022038-2140ReverseAGTAGCTCCCACAAACTCCGTGTRPC6NM_053559ForwardAGTGTACAGAATGCAGCCAGAAAC79758-837ReverseCAGCCCTTTGTAGGCATTGATCTRPC7XM_225159ForwardCCCTTTAACCTGGTGCCGA1132665-2778ReverseTGGAGTTCAGCATGCCCATT Open table in a new tab Western Blot Procedures—To detect TRPC expression, A7r5 cells were lysed in chilled Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Sigma protease inhibitor mixture I) followed by an incubation period of 30 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation (18,000 × g, 20 min at 4 °C), the protein content of the supernatants was quantified using Bio-Rad DC protein assay kits. For rat brain, tissue was homogenized in Nonidet P-40 buffer in exactly the same manner as above for A7r5 cells. For both A7r5 and rat brain, protein extracts (15 μg/lane of each) were resolved on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electroblotted onto Bio-Rad nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) (28Towbin H. Gordon J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). After transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked (l h, room temperature) in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBST; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing membrane blocking agent (5%) (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-TRPC1, -TRPC4, -TRPC5, or -TRPC6 antibodies, with rabbit anti-TRPC3 antibody, or with goat anti-TRPC7. Membranes were then washed two times (7 min) in TBST and incubated with secondary antibody (30 min; goat anti-rabbit or donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:2500 in TBST). Subsequently, membranes were washed three times (5 min) in TBST followed by a single wash (5 min) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Peroxidase activity was visualized using the ECL kit as according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Intracellular Ca2+ Measurements—Cells grown on coverslips were placed in external solution (107 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11.5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2; this solution is “cation-safe,” free of sulfate and phosphate anions) and loaded with fura-2/acetoxymethylester (2 μm) for 30 min at 20 °C. Cells were washed, and dye was allowed to de-esterify for a minimum of 30 min at 20 °C. Approximately 95% of the dye was confined to the cytoplasm as determined by the signal remaining after saponin permeabilization (29Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Cells on coverslips were placed in external solution in the absence or presence of 3 mm CaCl2, as described earlier (10Venkatachalam K. Zheng F. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

Resting Ca2+ levels in A7r5 cells were 100–200 nm (32Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). All measurements shown are representative of a minimum of three and in most cases a larger number of independent experiments. Whole Cell Patch Clamp Measurements—For patch clamp experiments, A7r5 cells grown on glass coverslips were transferred to the recording chamber and kept in a standard external solution (145 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 10 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.40. Free Ca2+ was adjusted to 50 μm using WEBMAXC software). Patch clamp experiments were conducted in the tight seal whole cell configuration. High resolution current recordings were acquired with a computer-based patch clamp amplifier system (EPC-10, HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Patch pipettes had resistances between 2 and 4 MΩ after filling with the standard pipette solution (145 mm cesium glutamate, 8 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 0.3 mm GTP, 10 mm EGTA, adjusted with CsOH to pH 7.2). Free Mg2+ was adjusted to 1 mm, and free Ca2+ was adjusted to 100 nm with MgCl2 and CaCl2 using WEBMAXC software. Immediately after establishment of the whole cell configuration, voltage ramps of 50-ms duration spanning the voltage range of –100 to +100 mV were delivered from a holding potential of 0 mV at a rate of 0.5 Hz. All voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential of 10 mV between external and internal solutions. Currents were filtered at 2.3 kHz and sampled at 20-μs intervals. Capacitive currents and series resistance were determined and corrected using the automatic capacitance and series resistance compensation of the EPC-10. For analysis, four ramps were averaged after current inactivation and used for leak subtraction. The low resolution temporal development of inward currents (at –80 mV) and outward current (80 mV) was leak-corrected with an individual ramp current record after current inactivation by measuring the current amplitude at –80 and 80 mV. Estimates of leak development in untreated cells measured over 300 s revealed a linear decrease in leak current of no more than 1 pA per 30 s. OAG and VP were added to the standard external solution as indicated. Materials and Miscellaneous Procedures—Thapsigargin, PP2, GF-109203X, and OAG were from E"

Peroxisomes are present in the cell bodies, dendrites, and presynaptic axon terminals of neuronal cells (7Citkowitz E. Holtzman E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1973; 21: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8McKenna O. Arnold G. Holtzman E. Brain Res. 1976; 117: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) as well as in growing neurites (9Ishikawa T. Kawai C. Sano M. Minatogawa Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 266: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Tau overexpression inhibits kinesin-dependent transport of peroxisomes, neurofilaments, and Golgi-derived vesicles into neurites (10Stammer K. Vogel R. Thies E. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that a loss of peroxisomes apparently makes neurons more vulnerable to oxidative stress (10Stammer K. Vogel R. Thies E. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1051-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferators (PPs) are a class of structurally dissimilar industrial and pharmaceutical chemicals that were originally identified as inducers of peroxisome proliferation in rat and mouse hepatocytes (11Corton J.C. Anderson S.P. Stauber A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 491-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 12Berger J. Moller D.E. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). Several PPs have shown to bind to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), these include Wy-14.643 (Wy), which binds with great affinity to PPARα and induces a strong activation of this receptor (11Corton J.C. Anderson S.P. Stauber A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 491-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). 4-Phenyl butyric (4-PB) is a PP that, in contrast to other PPs, is able to induce human peroxisome proliferation (13Wei H. Kemp S. McGuinness M.C. Moser A.B. Smith K.D. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism of peroxisome proliferation remains to be elucidated. According to Liu et al. (14Liu N. Qiang W. Kuang X. Thuillier P. Lynn W.S. Wong P.K. J. Neurovirol. 2002; 8: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), 4-PB activates PPARs in astrocytes; nevertheless, they suggested that peroxisome proliferation may be independent of PPARα activation. reactive oxygen species peroxisome proliferator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Wy-14.463 Alzheimer disease β-amyloid peptide acetylcholinesterase 3-aminotriazole 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine 4-phenyl butyric N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive neurodegeneration associated with extracellular deposits of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in the form of senile plaques (15Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 8: 741-766Crossref Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 16Hardy J.A. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11021) Google Scholar). Aβ peptide acquires neurotoxic properties when it forms homo-oligomeric species (17Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or heterooligomeric species with molecules associated with mature senile plaques and/or Aβ deposits in cerebral blood vessels (18Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar), such as the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a protein that forms stable Aβ·AChE complexes (19Inestrosa N.C. Alvarez A.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), which are more neurotoxic than Aβ alone (20Morgan C. Columbres M. Nuñez M.T. Inestrosa N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 74: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). There is evidence relating the etiopathology of AD with free radicals in AD brain patients (21Lovell M.A. Ehmann W.D.

Invest. 2003; 111: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) as well as in in vitro experiments, which suggest that Aβ neurotoxicity operates by an oxidative mechanism (25Behl C. Davis B. Lesle R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar, 26Koppal T. Subramaniam R. Drake J. Prasad M.R. Dhillon H. Butterfield D.A.

Evidence suggests that H2O2 at a high concentration produces toxic reactions; however, at a moderate concentration, H2O2 may functions as a second messenger mediating a variety of signal transduction pathways (28Thannickal V.J. Fanburg B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including tyrosine phosphatase 1B, Jun N-terminal kinase, protein kinase C, and transcription factors like AP-1 and NF-κB (29Rhee S.G. Exp. Mol. Med. 1999; 32: 53-59Crossref Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Several studies have also suggested that H2O2 mediates Aβ-cellular toxicity and increases the production of both Aβ and the amyloid precursor protein; hence, the redox interaction between Aβ, amyloid precursor protein, and metals may be a pathological positive feedback system between Aβ amyloidosis and oxidative stress (30Opazo C. Huang X. Cherny R.A. Moir D.A. Roher A.E. White A.R. Cappai R. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E Inestrosa N.C. Bush A.I. J. Biol.

Moreover, several studies report neuroprotection by antioxidants against Aβ-mediated cytotoxicity (32Behl C. Davis J. Cole G.M. Schubert D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 33Goodman Y. Bruce A.J. Cheng B. Mattson M.P. J.

In the present work, we have studied the possible neuroprotective properties of peroxisomes, when these organelles were induced to proliferate by specific PPs, in rat hippocampal neurons. Catalase-specific activity, bulk-rise calcium, and β-catenin levels, a key protein in the Wnt signaling pathway, were evaluated on hippocampal neurons pretreated with PPs and then challenged with Aβ in order to find possible neuroprotective effects of peroxisomes in these cells. We report here that a PPARα agonist induces the peroxisomal proliferation and attenuated Aβ-dependent neurotoxicity, decreases the intraneuronal ROS production, protects from β-catenin degradation, and prevents the cytoplasmic calcium influx induced by H2O2 and the Aβ peptide. These results suggest that the activation of PPARα prevented Aβ-dependent neurotoxicity by a mechanism that involves the induction of the peroxisome proliferation. Moreover, PPs prevents the neurotoxic changes induced by oxidative stress, an event that is involved in the Aβ neuropathologic effects. Reagents—Synthetic Aβ-(1-40) peptide corresponding to the human Aβ wild type sequence was obtained from Chiron Corp. Inc. (Emeryville, CA) and Calbiochem (Postfach, Germany). Chemicals—Catalase inhibitors 3-aminotriazole (3-AT), 4-phenyl butyric, and culture media were obtained from Sigma, Roche Applied Science, Merck, and Invitrogen; Fluo3-AM, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate, Calsein AM, and Mitotracker Orange were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Wy.14.463 was obtained from the Biomolecular Resource Laboratory. 2,7-Dichlorofluorescein was obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Primary Rat Hippocampal Neuron Cultures—Hippocampal neurons were obtained from 18-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (36Banker G.A. Cowan W.M. Brain Res. 1977; 126: 397-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Hippocampi were aseptically dissected and trypsinized for 20 min. After centrifugations for 1 min, cells were seeded in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% horse serum into 1% poly-l-lysine-coated plates. After 120 min, medium was removed, and neurobasal medium was added containing 1% B27 supplement from Invitrogen, plus streptomycin and penicillin. On day 3 of culture, hippocampal neurons were treated with 2 μm 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC) for 24 h to reduce the number of proliferating nonneuronal cells (36Banker G.A. Cowan W.M. Brain Res. 1977; 126: 397-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). On day 3-4, neurons were incubated with Wy or 4-PB. Neurons of 5-day-old cultures were used for various experiments; the average number of neurons in each experiment was around 95% of the total cells present in the cultures. Aβ Fibril Formation—The amyloid fibrils were obtained as previously described (37Muñoz F.J. Inestrosa N.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Specifically, stock solutions were prepared by dissolving freeze-dried aliquots of Aβ-(1-40) in Me2SO. Peptide stock aliquots were diluted in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 100 μm Aβ. The solutions were stirred continuously (210 rpm) at room temperature for 48 h. The quality of amyloid was verified by different criteria, such as turbidometry, Congo red binding, and thioflavin T spectrofluorometry (19Inestrosa N.C. Alvarez A. Perez C.A. Moreno R.D. Vicente M. Linker C. Casanueva O. Soto C. Garrido J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 37Muñoz F.J. Inestrosa N.C.

Inestrosa N.C. J Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3213-3223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of the homogenate were transferred to a denaturating buffer and subjected to Tris-Tricine gels to quantify the amounts of Aβ peptide contained in the fibrils. ThT-based Fluorometric Assay—Aliquots of Aβ peptide at the indicated concentrations were incubated at different times in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, at room temperature. To quantify the amyloid formation, the ThT fluorescence method was used (39Naiki H. Higuchi K. Nakakuki K. Takeda T. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 104-110PubMed Google Scholar). ThT binds specifically to amyloid, and such binding produces a shift in its emission spectrum and an increase in the fluorescent signal, which is proportional to the amount of amyloid formed (19Inestrosa N.C. Alvarez A. Perez C.A. Moreno R.D. Vicente M. Linker C. Casanueva O. Soto C. Garrido J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 38Alvarez A.

Following incubation, Aβ alone in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and 0.1 mm ThT in a final volume of 2 ml were added. Fluorescence was monitored at excitation of 450 nm and emission of 485 nm using a Shimadzu spectrofluorometer, as described previously by Inestrosa et al. (19Inestrosa N.C. Alvarez A. Perez C.A. Moreno R.D. Vicente M. Linker C. Casanueva O. Soto C. Garrido J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Fresh aliquots of samples were diluted 1:3 in water, and 5 μl were placed on Parlodion/carbon-coated 300-mesh copper grids for 1 min. Excess sample was removed, and 15 μl of 2% aqueous uranyl acetate was placed onto the grid for 30 s, followed by the removal of excess staining solution with filter paper and air drying. Observations were carried out using a Phillips Tecnai 12 electron microscope, as described previously (19Inestrosa N.C. Alvarez A. Perez C.A. Moreno R.D. Vicente M. Linker C. Casanueva O. Soto C. Garrido J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The quantification of amyloid aggregates and fibrils was made using Sigma Scan Pro software (19Inestrosa N.C. Alvarez A. Perez C.A. Moreno R.D. Vicente M. Linker C. Casanueva O. Soto C. Garrido J. Neuron. 1996; 16: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 38Alvarez A. Alarcón R. Opazo C. Campos E.C. Muñoz F.J. Calderón F.H. Dajas F. Gentry M.K. Doctor B.P.

Neuronal Viability (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) Reduction)—MTT assays were performed as previously described (40Inestrosa N.C. Godoy J.A. Quintanilla R.A. Koenig C. Bronfman M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Hippocampal neurons (1.1 × 105 cells/100-μl well) were assayed in serum- and phenol red-free medium. Cells were previously incubated with or without Wy, a rodent peroxisome proliferator, for 48 h at 37 °C, and after this incubation, the neurons were treated with Aβ or with Aβ plus 3-AT for 30 min before the addition of Aβ. Cell viability was measured by the MTT method. Following the addition of MTT, the reaction was ended using MTT solubilization solution (1% Triton X-100 in acidic isopropyl alcohol) (0.1 n HCl). MTT reduction was determined in an ELISA spectrophotometer METERTECH E960 at 540 and 650 nm. Immunofluorescence Studies—Hippocampal neurons were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips (40,000 neurons/cover). After 5 days in Neurobasal/B27 medium, neurons were washed and exposed to Aβ in the presence of the PPARα agonist. Neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 90% methanol. Immunostaining was done with polyclonal antiperoxisomal membrane proteins (41Santos M.J. Kawada M.E. Espeel M. Figueroa C. Alvarez A. Hidalgo U. Metz C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24890-24896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and secondary antibody labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Affinity Bio Reagents Inc., Golden, CO), as described by Santos et al. (42Santos M.J. Imakata T. Shio H. Lazarow P.B. Science. 1988; 239: 1536-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 43Santos M.J. Imakata T. Shio H. Lazarow P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10502-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number of peroxisomes was quantified following the procedure described by Wei et al. (13Wei H. Kemp S. McGuinness M.C. Moser A.B. Smith K.D. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the number of neurites was evaluated using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetic, Silver Spring, MD). To detect β-catenin, an anti-β-catenin antibody (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), was used. Reverse Transcription-PCR of PPARα—Neurons were harvested, and the total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIZOL™ reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using poly(dT) primers and the Superscript II enzyme. Amplification by PCR was performed using the following primers for PPARα:5′-GTG CCT GTC CGT CGG GAT GT-3′ and 5′-GTG AGC TCG GTG ACG GTC TC-3′ (fragment size 364 bp). As a semiquantitative control Quantum RNA™ β-actin from Ambion was used. The reaction volume was 25 μl, and the products were visualized in 1.5% agarose/TAE gels and stained with ethidium bromide. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel poured in TAE buffer. The band intensity for PPARα was measured with the software MATRIX and normalized with β-actin band intensity. Catalase Activity—Hippocampal neurons were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well and treated with the PPs as indicated before. Neurons were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and sonicated. Catalase activity was measured using a specific substrate (42Santos M.J. Imakata T. Shio H. Lazarow P.B. Science. 1988; 239: 1536-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 44Leigthon F. Coloma L. Koenig C. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 281-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). ROS Measurements—Hippocampal neurons were incubated with the fluorescent probe 2,7-dichlorofluorescein at 10 μm for 10 min (45Miranda S. Foncea R. Guerrero J. Leighton F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Then wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline solution, and 10 μm Aβ was added to the wells and incubated for 4 h. Cells were photographed in a fluorescent microscope. Photographs were scanned and analyzed by the SCION Image Program (SCION Co.). Results in arbitrary units were expressed as a percentage of the fluorescence signal of untreated cell (control) set at 100%. Western Blot for β-Catenin in Hippocampal Neurons—Neurons were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. They were scraped and homogenized in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with a protease inhibitor mixture (100 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin). The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked with 3% nonfat milk, Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were incubated with different primary antibodies, β-catenin (1:1000) and β-tubulin (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), overnight at 4 °C and then probed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated (1:1000) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, nitro blue tetrazolium, and/or ECL reagents were used to visualize the protein bands on nitrocellulose membranes. Calcium Measurement—Neuronal calcium changes were measured by confocal microscopy. Neurons were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and cultured for 5 days. The cells were then loaded for 30 min with 5 μm Fluo3-AM in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes glucose containing 0.02% pluronic acid and then washed and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. Coverslips were then mounted in a chamber on the stage of a confocal laser-scanning microscope (model Pascal; Carl Zeiss Ltd.). The fluorescence changes determined by Fluo3-AM represent the cytoplasmatic calcium changes (46Quintanilla R.A. Porras O.H. Castro J. Barros L.F. Cell Calcium. 2000; 28: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Images were acquired using a 488-nm argon laser to excite Fluo3-AM fluorescence. The signals were collected at 505-530 nm for detecting Fluo3-AM. Signals from control neurons and neurons treated with H2O2 were compared using identical settings for laser power, confocal thickness, and detector sensitivity (40Inestrosa N.C. Godoy J.A. Quintanilla R.A. Koenig C. Bronfman M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The images were analyzed, and the mean of the Fluo3-AM signal was measured per live cell. Estimation of fluorescence intensity of Fluo3-AM was presented like the pseudoratio (ΔF/F) indicated by the following formula: ΔF/F = (F - Fbase)/(Fbase - B), where F is the measured fluorescence intensity of the indicator, Fbase is the fluorescence intensity before the stimulation, and B is the background signal determined from the average of areas adjacent to the cells (47Newman E.A. Zahs K.R. Science. 1997; 275: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 48Svoboda K.W. Denk D. Kleinfeld D. Tank W. Nature. 1997; 385: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Potential Staining—Mitochondria membrane potential was estimated by specific mitochondrial probes tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate and Mitotracker Orange, detected in a confocal microscope. Neurons were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and cultured for 5 days. The cells were then loaded for 30 min with Mitotracker Orange plus Calsein AM, or 30 nm TMRM+ in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes (KRH)-glucose containing 0.02% pluronic acid and then washed and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. Coverslips were then mounted in a chamber on the stage of a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM Pascal Zeiss model 510; Carl Zeiss Ltd.). The fluorescence changes determined by Mitotracker Orange and TMRM+ fluorescence indicated the mitochondria potential staining (49Lacor P.N. Buniel M.C. Chang L. Fernandez S.J. Gong Y. Viola K.L.

Images were acquired using a 543-nm helium-neon laser to excite TMRM+ or Mitotracker Orange, and the signals were collected at 570 nm (49Lacor P.N. Buniel M.C. Chang L. Fernandez S.J. Gong Y.

Signals from control neurons and neurons incubated with different treatments were compared using identical settings for laser power, confocal thickness, and detector sensitivity (40Inestrosa N.C. Godoy J.A. Quintanilla R.A. Koenig C. Bronfman M. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The images were analyzed, and the mean TMRM+ and Mitotracker Orange signals were measured per live cell. Estimation of fluorescence intensity of TMRE was presented like the pseudoratio (ΔF/F) indicated by the following formula: ΔF/F = (F - Fbase)/(Fbase - B), where F is the measured fluorescence intensity of the indicator, Fbase is the fluorescence intensity before the stimulation, and B is the background signal determined from the average of areas adjacent to the cells (27Abramov A. Canevari L. Duchen M.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the values from the number of experiments as indicated in the corresponding figures. Data were evaluated statistically by using Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. An analysis of variance test was used to compare n differences between experiments. Formation and Characterization of Amyloid Aggregates—Aβ peptide is neurotoxic for different neuron types and induced a series of neuropathologic alterations. There are controversies about the Aβ species involved in the neurodegenerative process. The Aβ fibrils induced neurodegenerative changes, including neuronal cell death, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and calcium deregulation (16Hardy J.A. Selkoe D.J.

Other Aβ species, like oligomers, that did not present fibril structure induced preferentially their effect at synaptic regions (49Lacor P.N. Buniel M.C. Chang L. Fernandez S.J. Gong Y. Viola K.L.

In order to investigate the Aβ species formed in our studies, we characterized our Aβ fibril preparations (Fig. 1). The Aβ peptide was aggregate for 24 h under constant stirring at room temperature. Then aliquots of the total fraction (T) were taken, and the amyloid fibrils were separated by centrifugation into a pellet (P) and a supernatant (S). The amount of Aβ fibrils formed was established under Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions, the Aβ peptide formed practically 100% of fibril species, indicating the absence of Aβ soluble species in the supernatant of our preparations. Additionally, the quantity of Aβ fibrils formed was studied by thioflavin T assay on the different fractions after 24 h of the aggregation process (Fig. 1B). In both the total fraction and the pellet, the Aβ species formed correspond to fibrils. Finally, we studied the form and shape of the Aβ aggregates formed over time under the electron microscope (Fig. 1C). Pictures indicated typical amyloid fibrils in the total fraction after Aβ aggregation. After 72 h, the Aβ fibrils are still stable, showing the typical fibrilar structure reported previously (15Selkoe D.J. Physiol.

To investigate the potential mechanism underlying these responses, we examined the acute in vitro and in vivo effects of amphetamine and methamphetamine (METH) on phosphorylation and down-regulation of rat DAT using wild type and N-terminal truncation mutants. Phosphorylation of DAT assessed by 32PO4 metabolic labeling was increased up to 2-fold by in vitro treatment of rDAT LLC-PK1 cells with amphetamine or METH and was similarly increased in rat striatal tissue by in vitro application or in vivo injection of METH. The dopamine transport blocker (-)-cocaine did not affect DAT phosphorylation but prevented the phosphorylation increase induced by METH. Phosphorylation of DAT induced by METH was also prevented by the protein kinase C blocker bisindoylmaleimide I and was absent in an N-terminally truncated protein that lacks the first 21 residues including 6 serines that also represent the site of phorbol ester induced phosphorylation. Down-regulation of transport induced by METH was also cocaine- and protein kinase C-dependent but was retained in the N-terminal truncation mutant. These results demonstrate that transport or binding of METH stimulates DAT phosphorylation and down-regulation by a mechanism that requires protein kinase C but that METH-induced down-regulation can occur independently of direct transporter phosphorylation. The finding that DAT phosphorylation is stimulated by amphetamines reveals a previously unknown effect of these drugs that is not produced by cocaine and may be related to reinforcement.

This regulates transmitter availability for DA receptors and is crucial for the temporal and spatial shaping of dopaminergic neurotransmission (1Giros B. Jaber M. Jones S.R. Wightman R.M. Caron M.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). Neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and attention deficit disorder are associated with abnormal DA levels that may result from functional dysregulation of DAT (2Miller G.W. Gainetdinov R.R. Levey A.I. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 424-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). DAT is also a major site of action for numerous psychostimulant and neurotoxic drugs that modulate DA levels or lead to dopaminergic neurodegeneration (3Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K.

Amphetamine (AMPH) and methamphetamine (METH) are DAT substrates that raise extracellular transmitter levels by competing with endogenous DA for transport and inducing DA efflux through transport reversal (4Eshleman A.J.

DA uptake and DAT surface expression are also reduced by in vitro substrate pretreatment or in vivo METH injection via mechanisms that are blocked or attenuated by PKC inhibitors and cocaine (15Sandoval V.

These findings suggest the presence of a rapid feedback process associated with phosphorylation conditions and substrate transport that regulates DA clearance by modulating DAT cell surface expression. Reverse transport of DAT is also regulated by PKC, because AMPH-induced DA efflux is blocked by PKCβ inhibitors (21Kantor L. Gnegy M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 592-598PubMed Google Scholar, 22Johnson L.A. Guptaroy B. Lund D. Shamban S. Gnegy M.E. J. Biol.

Gnegy M.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 389: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Removal or mutation of DAT N-terminal serines suppresses AMPH-induced DA efflux (14Khoshbouei H. Sen N.

PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 387-393Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar), suggesting a relationship between PKC-mediated phosphorylation and an efflux-promoting form of the protein. We have probed the molecular basis and potential relationships between these processes by examining the involvement of psychostimulant substrates and uptake blockers in DAT phosphorylation and down-regulation. In this report we demonstrate that AMPH and METH but not cocaine stimulate the level of DAT metabolic phosphorylation in both heterologously expressing cells and rat brain tissue. METH-induced DAT phosphorylation occurs on the same domain identified for PMA-stimulated phosphorylation and requires PKC activity and binding or active transport of drug. However, METH-induced transport down-regulation is retained in a phosphorylation-deficient DAT mutant, demonstrating that this process does not require transporter phosphorylation. These findings directly demonstrate the occurrence of PKC-dependent substrate-induced DAT phosphorylation that was previously implicated in mutagenesis studies as a requirement for AMPH-induced efflux (14Khoshbouei H. Sen N. Guptaroy B. Johnson L. Lund D. Gnegy M.E. Galli A. Javitch J.A. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 387-393Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and indicate that PKC is part of a common pathway for down-regulation of DAT induced by PMA and METH. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Cell Culture—The wt rDAT construct was obtained from Dr. David Donovan (NIA, National Institutes of Health) and placed in a pcDNA 3.0 plasmid. A mutant construct lacking the first 21 N-terminal amino acids with the addition of an initiation methionine was produced from the wt cDNA using the Stratagene QuikChange® kit. The entire DAT coding region of the resulting Δ21 rDAT construct was sequenced for accuracy (Northwoods DNA, Solway, MN) and used for transfection. For the production of stable transformants parental LLC-PK1 cells were grown to ∼50% confluency and transfected using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and 0.5 μg of the Δ21 rDAT pcDNA 3.0 plasmid. Transformants were selected 24 h later by the addition of 400 μg/ml Geneticin (G418) to the cell culture medium. LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing wt rDAT (24Gu H. Wall S.C. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7124-7130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or pooled Δ21 rDAT cell lines were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 200 μg/ml G418, and 1× penicillin/streptomycin in an incubation chamber gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2 at 37 °C. The cells were grown to ∼70% confluence in 6- or 12-well plates for use. Western blotting of cell lysates with DAT monoclonal antibody (26Gaffaney J.D. Vaughan R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) revealed comparable expression levels of the mature 100-110-kDa forms of the wt and Δ21 DAT protein. Dopamine Uptake—For [3H]DA uptake assays rDAT LLC-PK1 cells were washed twice with 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer HEPES (KRH) buffer (25 mm HEPES, 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Triplicate wells were pretreated at 37 °C for 30 min or other indicated times with 1 ml of KRH containing vehicle, test treatments, or phosphorylation modulators prior to assay for transport. Soluble test compounds (METH, AMPH, (-)-cocaine, SCH 23390, and sulpiride) were prepared in distilled/deionized water, and OA, PMA, bisindoylmaleimide I (BIM), and H89 were prepared at high concentrations in Me2SO followed by dilution in the incubation mixture to a final Me2SO concentration of 0.1%. At the end of the pretreatment interval, the cells were placed on ice and rapidly washed three times with ice-cold KRH to remove pretreatment drug prior to assay for DA transport. Uptake was initiated by adding 10 μl of a 100× DA stock solution to bring the final concentration of [3H]DA to 10 nm and that of total DA to 3 μm. Nonspecific uptake was determined with 100 μm (-)-cocaine and was subtracted from total uptake values. Uptake assays were carried out at 37 °C for 8 min and terminated by rapidly washing the wells three times with 1 ml of ice-cold KRH. The cells were solubilized in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer consisting of 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 μm OA, and one Roche Complete Mini protease inhibitor tablet/10 ml of buffer. The lysates were then measured for incorporated radioactivity using a Packard 1900CA liquid scintillation counter at 58% efficiency. Phosphorylation of DAT in Cells—On the day of the experiment, the cells were incubated in phosphate-free medium for 30 min followed by exchange with fresh medium containing 0.5 mCi/ml of 32PO4. The cells were labeled for 4 h at 37 °C, followed by application of test compounds to duplicate or triplicate wells for 2-30 min. In all of the experiments, the cells in parallel wells were treated with OA or PMA as positive controls for stimulated phosphorylation. At the end of the treatment, the cells were washed once with 500 μl of ice-cold sucrose phosphate buffer (0.32 m sucrose and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and lysed on ice for 15 min with 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 4 °C at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The soluble fraction was collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation with DAT antibody 16 followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In all of the experiments control and experimental groups were 32PO4 labeled, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to electrophoresis and autoradiography at the same time and exactly in parallel. All of the autoradiographs shown and analyzed were obtained from equal exposure times to allow for direct comparison of signal intensities. Phosphorylation of DAT in Striatal Slices—Metabolic phosphorylation of DAT in rat striatal slices was performed as previously described (25Foster J.D. Pananusorn B. Vaughan R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25178-25186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (175-300 g) were decapitated, and the striata were rapidly removed and weighed. The tissue was sliced into 350-μm slices using a McElvain Tissue Chopper and placed into wells of a 12-well culture plate containing oxygenated Krebs-bicarbonate buffer consisting of 25 mm NaHCO3, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3. The slices were preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C, with shaking at 105 rpm, followed by exchange with fresh buffer containing 1 mCi/ml 32PO4 and continued incubation with shaking at 30 °C for 90-120 min. 95% O2, 5% CO2 was gently blown across the top of the plate during the incubation, and test compounds or vehicle were added for the final 30 min or other indicated times. At the end of labeling, the tissue slices were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were removed, and 1 ml of ice-cold Krebs-bicarbonate buffer was added to the slices. The tissue was disrupted by six passages through a 26-gauge needle and centrifuged at 500 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were removed. The sedimented membranes were solubilized with 0.5% SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol) at 50 mg/ml original wet weight and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to remove SDS-insoluble material. The soluble fraction was collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation with DAT antibody 16 followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Phosphorylation of DAT in Striatal Slices Following in Vivo METH Administration—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (175-300 g) were weighed and injected subcutaneously with 1-ml volumes of sterile saline or 15 mg/kg METH. Thirty minutes after injection, the animals were decapitated, and the striata were quickly removed, weighed, and sliced. Metabolic labeling of the slices was initiated within 10-15 min of tissue harvest and was performed as described above except that the 32PO4 incubation time was reduced to 30 min. During the 32PO4 labeling the striatal slices obtained from one hemisphere of each animal received no further addition, whereas the slices from the other hemispheres were treated with 10 μm OA as a positive control for stimulated DAT phosphorylation. The slices were then processed, solubilized, and prepared for immunoprecipitation as described above. Immunoprecipitation, Electrophoresis, and Autoradiography—32PO4-labeled samples from cell lysates or solubilized striatal membranes were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal antiserum 16 generated against rDAT N-terminal amino acids 42-59 (11Vaughan R.A. Huff R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15541-15546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Precipitated samples were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with high range Rainbow molecular mass standards, and gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography using Kodak Biomax film or PhosphorImager analysis. For all of the experiments, the samples were labeled, processed, and electrophoresed on the same gel exactly in parallel. For figure preparation, the lanes that were not adjacent in the original gel but separated by blank lanes or juxtaposed for purposes of logical data presentation are separated by black lines. 32PO4-labeled DAT migrates as a broad band on these gels (striatal forms, 80-90 kDa; expressed forms, 100-110 kDa), often as a complex of a doublet or multiple forms. The identity of this complex of bands as DAT was verified in various experiments by co-electrophoresis of samples with photoaffinity labeled DAT, by using preimmune antiserum for immunoprecipitation negative controls, and by Western blotting immunoprecipitated 32PO4-labeled samples with a highly specific monoclonal DAT antibody (26Gaffaney J.D. Vaughan R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 692-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to demonstrate the correspondence of 32PO4-labeled and immunoreactive bands. Similar and additional peptide blocking controls for the identity of the phosphorylated DAT bands have been documented in previous studies (10Huff R.A. Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. Uhl G.R. J.

For quantification, the 80-90-kDa region of the autoradiographs shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 were scanned and quantified with Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad) or ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics) software. The phosphorylation intensities of treated samples were expressed as percentages of the basal phosphorylation level, which was defined as 100%. Normalized phosphorylation values from multiple experiments were averaged for statistical analysis by Student's t test or ANOVA using Prism 3 software.FIGURE 3METH induces DAT phosphorylation in rat striatal tissue.

The rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and were housed and treated in accordance with regulations established by the University of North Dakota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Transported Substrates Down-regulate DA Transport Activity— [3H]DA transport and regulation of DAT by PMA have been well characterized in rDAT LLC-PK1 cells (10Huff R.A. Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J.

https://openalex.org/W1972764026,"Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) is a calcium calmodulin-regulated serine/threonine protein kinase involved in ischemic neuronal death. In situ hybridization experiments show that DAPK mRNA expression is up-regulated in brain following a global ischemic insult and down-regulated in ischemic tissues after focal ischemia. DAPK is inactive in normal brain tissues, where it is found in its phosphorylated state and becomes rapidly and persistently dephosphorylated and activated in response to ischemia in vivo. A similar dephosphorylation pattern is detected in primary cortical neurons subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced toxicity. Both a calcineurin inhibitor, FK506, and a selective NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, inhibit the dephosphorylation of DAPK after in vitro ischemia. This indicates that DAPK could be activated by NMDA receptor-mediated calcium flux, activation of calcineurin, and subsequent DAPK dephosphorylation. Moreover, concomitantly to dephosphorylation, DAPK is proteolytically processed by cathepsin after ischemia. Furthermore, a selective DAPK inhibitor is neuroprotective in both in vitro and in vivo ischemic models. These results indicate that DAPK plays a key role in mediating ischemic neuronal injury."

Energy status is monitored by the cellular AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) system, whereas leptin regulates total energy balance. We investigated the roles of AMPK and leptin in cognition and survival under diet restriction (DR). Hippocampal AMPK activity increases with energy restriction.

Since the Garden of Eden and the trees of knowledge and life, the connection between food, cognition, and survival has been recognized. Today, nutritional status is a well accepted regulator of neural function and longevity. Studies have shown that mild energy restriction (to 60% of control) improves cognitive function, whereas severe restriction (to 40%) prejudices it (1Pitsikas N. Algeri S. Neurobiol.

Such cognitive dysfunction may manifest as deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, including spatial information processing (3Petit T.L.

Neuroapoptotic cell death is a multistep process involving several key molecules, modulation of which may inhibit the process.

Reduced nutritional status in mice increased the numbers of newly generated cells primarily in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (14Cameron H.A. McKay R.D. J. Comp.

AMPK is allosterically activated by 5′-AMP, which accumulates following ATP hydrolysis (18Hardie D.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 19Hardie D.G.

Whereas leptin exerts its catabolic effects in the periphery by stimulating AMPK phosphorylation and activation, its central effects on energy balance act through hypothalamic AMPK dephosphorylation and inhibition (23Andersson U.

Linking systemic energy balance (appetite and autonomic nervous activity) with cellular AMP concentrations makes obvious “biological sense.” There are also leptin receptors in the hippocampus, suggesting a possible role for leptin signaling in cognition. The involvement of leptin and AMPK in brain function has heretofore not been addressed and is the subject of this report. We have used diet restriction (DR) tools to define the processes underlying the effects of nutrition on cognition and survival. Our results indicate that AMP kinase responds to nutritional status and modulates cognitive ability by affecting the balance between neurogenesis and neuroapoptosis. Leptin reverses the deleterious effects of severe DR, consistent with its role as a “survival” (anti-apoptotic) hormone under such stress conditions. Cells and Reagents—PC12 cells were kindly provided by O. Meyuhas, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem. These cells were grown either in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% horse serum, 8% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and gentamicin or with 1% horse serum in the presence of nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml), which causes the cells to differentiate. Murine leptin was provided by A. Gertler. AICAR was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals. Mice—The experimental protocol was approved by the institutional committee for the use of animals, number MD-89.52-4. 8-10-week-old female Sabra mice (29-32g) were assigned at random to different groups of 10 mice. The food provided was Purina chow. Diet Restriction—Control mice received food ad libitum (AL). Diet-restricted mice received a diet of 57 kCal/week/mouse (2.16 g/day/mouse) as 60% of the requirement or 38 kCal/week/mouse (1.44 g/day/mouse) for 40% DR. DR was carried out for 10 days. Behavioral tests were performed using the eight-arm spatial maze during the second week of the experiment. During the behavioral tests, half the animals in each group were treated with AICAR (1-2 mm equal to 258-516 mg/kg) or leptin (1 mg/kg) and the other half with saline. The mice were treated with a dose of 1 mg/kg leptin based on previous experiments. We have evaluated the effect of 100-2000 μg/kg of body weight (intraperitoneal) on cognitive function and found that 1000-2000 μg/kg were the optimal dosages, whereas lower concentrations impaired it. 3E. M. Berry and Y. Avraham, unpublished observations. This dose is likely to lead to leptin concentrations in the high physiological range (∼100 ng/ml) in the injected animals (characteristic of obese subjects), which declined to lower concentrations after 24 h (29Dridi S. Williams J. Bruggeman V. Onagbesan M. Raver N. Decuypere E. Djiane J. Gertler A. Taouis M. Domest. Anim. Endocrinol. 2000; 18: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). AICAR and leptin were dissolved and diluted in saline. All administrations were given intraperitoneally in a volume of 0.1 ml/mouse. Mice were sacrificed by decapitation after the behavioral tests, and the hippocampi were frozen at -70 °C. RT-PCR Analysis—Total hippocampal RNA was extracted using Tri-Fast reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions and reverse transcribed. Primers specific for OBRlong were GATGTTCCAAACCCCAAGAA and CATAGCTGCTGGGACCATCT, for OBRshort ATCTGCCGGTGTGAGTTTTC and CCAGTCTCTTGCTCCTCACC, for BAX CTGAGCTGACCTTGGAGC and GACTCCAGCCACAAAGATG, for BCL-2 GACAGAAGATCATGCCGTCC and GGTACCAATGGCACTTCAAG, and for actin CAGCTTCTTTGCAGCTCCTT and TCACCCACATAGGAGTCCT. All primers were synthesized by Danyel Biotech. Immunoblot Analysis—Total hippocampal protein was extracted using Tri-Fast reagent. Aliquots of the clarified lysates containing 30 mg of protein were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer (6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), and 250 mm mercaptoethanol), at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding in a Western blot analysis was prevented by immersing the membranes in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBS-T)) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then exposed to the indicated antibodies diluted 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. AMPK, phospho-AMPK, and poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase were obtained from Cell Signaling. BAX, BCL-2, and actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The blots were rinsed in TBS-T and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies 1:10,000 for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody-antigen complexes were visualized by detecting enhanced chemiluminescence with x-ray film. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—Cells were grown in 60-mm plates and treated with AICAR for 48 h. Apoptosis was evaluated using the annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate detection kit (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge MA). Briefly, both attached and floating cells were collected, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended at a density of 5 × 105/ml in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, stained for annexin V, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry—Mice were perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Their brains were removed and fixed further in the same solution. 5-mm sections, cut on the same day, were dewaxed and hydrated through graded ethanols, cooked in 25 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0, in a pressure cooker at 115 °C for 3 min (decloaking chamber; Biocare Medical), transferred into boiling deionized water, and left to cool down for 20 min. After 5 min of treatment in 3% H2O2, slides were incubated with rabbit polyclonal activated caspase-3 antibody diluted 1:100 in CAS-Block (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 3 h at room temperature, washed three times with Optimax (Biogenex), incubated for 30 min with anti-rabbit EnVision (DAKO), and developed with diamino benzidine for 15 min. Catecholamine Measurements—Catecholamines were measured as described previously (2Avraham Y. Bonne O. Berry E.M. Brain Res. 1996; 732: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The assays for dopamine and norepinephrine were performed by HPLC separation and detection using HPLC-ElectroChemicalDetector. Values are presented as a concentration (ng/mg tissue). Eight-arm Maze—The animals were placed in an eight-arm maze that is a scaled down version of that developed for rats (30Olton D.S. Samuelson R.J. J. Exp. Psychol. Anim. Behav. Process. 1976; 2: 97-116Crossref Scopus (1550) Google Scholar, 31Pick C.G. Yanai J. Int. J. Neurosci. 1983; 21: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We used water deprivation, achieved by limiting water consumption overnight and a reward of 50 μl of water presented at the end of each arm. The mice were tested (number of entries) during 5 days until they made entries into all 8 arms or until they completed 24 entries, whichever came first. Hence, the lower the score, the better the cognitive function. Maze performance was calculated per each day for 5 consecutive days. Results were presented as area under the curve utilizing the formula: (number of entries in day 2 + day 3 + day 4 + day 5) - 4* (day 1) for each mouse, and the scores were averaged for each group. A figure describing the averaged group scores was drawn. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means and S.D. or S.E. Results were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance and two-tailed t test. Post hoc testing was carried out using the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons procedure. Nutritional Depletion Induces Dose-dependent Hippocampal AMPK Activation—To study how nutrition may modulate cognitive function, we measured hippocampal AMPK activity in response to DR. Mice were assigned at random (10 mice/group) to different levels of DR for 5 days and then sacrificed. DR led to elevation of AMPK phosphorylation in a nutrient depletion-dependent manner, reaching a potent AMPK activation (p < 0.01) upon DR to 40% (Fig. 1A). Treatment of the mice with 1-2 mm AICAR (5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside), a specific pharmacological activator of this kinase, could replicate the potent hippocampal AMPK phosphorylation (p < 0.001 for all dosages) achieved by severe DR (Fig. 1B), whereas a wide range of lower AICAR concentrations exhibit more modest AMPK activation (data not shown). Low Level AMPK Activation Enhances Neurogenesis and Cognition— We questioned the function of AMPK activation in the hippocampus. Because our results showed that nutrient depletion can activate AMPK over a wide range, we used AICAR, which was previously demonstrated to activate hippocampal AMPK in a dose-dependent manner, to mimic these nutritional effects. Mice were treated with bromodeoxyuridine and either saline or 25 nm AICAR (low level stimulation) once daily for 10 days. The number of bromodeoxyuridine-immunoreactive cells in the dentate gyrus measures the generation rate of new cells and was significantly increased from 1000 ± 105 to 1754 ± 139 (p = 0.01) following the treatment (Fig. 2A). Next, we performed behavioral testing using the eight-arm maze to determine whether there was a concomitant improvement in cognition. Mice treated with 25 nm AICAR performed significantly better (p < 0.05) than the controls (Fig. 2B). High Activation Modulates Catecholamines, Impaired Cognition, and Neuroapoptosis—To study the effect of further augmentation of hippocampal AMPK activation, mice were injected daily with higher doses of AICAR (1-2 mm) for 10 days. Such treatment decreased norepinephrine concentrations progressively (p < 0.01, 0.001 for the two dosages, respectively) while elevating those of dopamine (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). We also determined whether these findings were associated with alterations in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Mice given high dose AICAR exhibited a significant deterioration in maze performance compared with the AL group (p < 0.05) and in a similar manner to mice under DR to 40% (Fig. 3B). To elucidate the cellular mechanisms involved in these AMPK effects, we measured, by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, the proteins associated with apoptosis. AICAR treatment induced up-regulation of BAX while reducing BCL-2, thereby promoting apoptosis (Fig. 3C). High AMPK Activation Induces an Intense Apoptotic Cell Death in Vitro—To confirm the cellular effects of AMPK in the hippocampus, we also performed in vitro studies using pc12 cells. This cell line is derived from rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cells and can be differentiated into sympathetic-like neurons, thus providing a suitable model for these studies (32Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar). Treatment of differentiated cells with the same doses of AICAR (from 0.125 to 1.0 mm) induced a dose-dependent reduction in the number of viable cells (p < 0.01 for 0.25 mm and p < 0.001 for higher dosages), reaching almost total obliteration after 96 h (Fig. 4A). We also evaluated the apoptotic ratio at 48 h by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Annexin V staining revealed that AICAR treatment induces apoptotic cell death (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 for 0.25 and 1 mm, respectively) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Nutritional Status Differentially Modulates Leptin and Its Receptor Expression—Leptin is a key hormone in the regulation of energy balance and is known to modulate AMPK activity in other systems (27Montague C.T. Farooqi I.S. Whitehead J.P. Soos M.A. Rau H. Wareham N.J. Sewter C.P. Digby J.E. Mohammed S.N. Hurst J.A. Cheetham C.H. Earley A.R. Barnett A.H. Prins J.B. O'Rahilly S.

Nature. 2002; 415: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). We next considered how leptin may interact with AMPK in modulating brain function. We analyzed leptin functionality under different degrees of diet restriction. Mice were assigned at random to three groups and fed AL, DR to 60%, or DR to 40% for 10 days. Serum leptin concentrations (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) decreased promptly after implementation of both DR regimens and were nearly undetectable after 4 days (Fig. 5A). Analysis of leptin receptor expression by RT-PCR demonstrated an increasing elevation of the short form with the degree of diet restriction. However, although DR to 60% induced significant up-regulation of the long (functional) form of the OB receptor (p < 0.01), this was not observed in response to 40% DR (Fig. 5B). Following these results, we studied the effects of leptin administration on hippocampal AMPK phosphorylation. Treatment of 40% diet-restricted mice for 72 h with 1 mg/kg leptin significantly reduced (p < 0.05) the AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 5C). Leptin Reversed the Effects of Severe DR on Cognition, Catecholamines, and Neuroapoptosis—Next, we investigated the effects of leptin administration (restoration) on neural function in diet-restricted mice. Mice were assigned at random to four groups. The groups were kept under AL or DR to 40% for 10 days and injected daily with either 1 mg/kg leptin or saline for 5 days during the second week. Treatment with leptin reversed the impaired eight-arm maze performance associated with DR to 40% (p < 0.05); the control group was not affected by leptin administration (Fig. 6A). Cognitive performance improvement was also observed in the Morris Water Maze (data not shown). We then evaluated the effects on the concentrations of norepinephrine and dopamine in the hippocampus. Treatment with leptin reversed the reduction of norepinephrine following DR (p < 0.05). Leptin down-regulated dopamine concentrations in the AL group (p < 0.05) yet did not induce any significant reduction in the DR group in which dopamine concentrations were already reduced (Fig. 6B). To elucidate the cellular mechanisms involved in leptin effects, we again determined by RT-PCR and immunoblotting the ratio between pro- and anti-apoptotic genes. Although leptin treatment did not significantly change hippocampal Bcl-2 and Bax levels of the control group, it up-regulated Bcl-2 and reduced Bax expression of DR mice. Although this effect was repeated both in RNA and protein levels, BCL-2 accumulation was detected only in the protein level, suggesting the involvement of another regulation mechanism than transcription rate. Analysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage demonstrated a reduction in the cleaved subunit following leptin treatment, suggesting an increase in the direction of survival (Fig. 6C). We further confirmed the anti-apoptotic effect of leptin by detection of activated caspase-3 expression as pathognomonic of apoptotic cell death. Activated caspase-3 could not be detected in the hippocampi of control animals. Leptin significantly reduced the immunoreactivity of the activated caspase-3 observed following 40% DR (Fig. 6D). Leptin Increases Survival under Severe Energy Restriction—Severe energy restriction leads to deterioration of neural function and eventually death. Because leptin improves cognitive function following DR to 40% and attenuates neural apoptosis, we investigated whether it may also promote mice survival under these same severe conditions. First, mice were fed AL or DR to 40% for 12 days, and leptin was administrated by daily injection during the second week (5 days). 95% of the mice survived with leptin treatment compared with 65% in the control group (p < 0.05). Next, we repeated our results using mini-osmotic pumps to deliver 0.05 mg/kg/h leptin or saline continuously for 16 days (12 animals in each group). Neither of the saline- or leptin-treated AL groups had any mortality, whereas in the DR groups despite a similar weight loss, leptin-treated mice survived significantly longer (Kaplan Meir log rank, p <0.05, one-tail). The 50% survival in the treated group increased from 9 to 14 days. (Fig. 7). During the course of evolution, survival depended on the ability to conserve body system functionality when food was scarce. To these biological requirements also might be added the ability to think and react appropriately to stress situations. The crucial importance of maintaining cognitive function under such conditions requires development of suitable adaptive mechanisms. We examined how these biological mechanisms were coordinated to promote survival of the organism. We demonstrate here the integration of cellular energy status, nutritional balance, and cognitive function through the concerted cellular and systemic actions of AMPK and leptin, actions directed toward promoting survival. Nutrient depletion stimulates cellular AMPK activity, which is probably because of the elevation in the AMP/ATP ratio. This activity has a tremendous impact on cell fate. We hypothesized that AMPK may modulate cellular changes in the brain. Investigation of these mechanisms in the hippocampus showed that AMPK is capable of promoting two contradictory cell outcomes, triggering both neurogenesis and neuroapoptosis. The function of AMPK as a neurogenesis promoter is in line with recent work demonstrating its role in neural development (33Tschape J.A. Hammerschmied C. Muhlig-Versen M. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Kretzschmar D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6367-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It provides a mechanism for neuronal expansion and improved cognitive function during progressive mild energy restriction. Furthermore, these findings may explain the beneficial effects of DR found in neurodegenerative disorders (6Duan W. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 7Love R. Lancet Neurol. 2005; 4: 84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and in the suppression of age-related deficits in learning and memory (6Duan W. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The mechanism suggested here is that the anti-apoptotic actions of AMPK are limited to conditions of mild energy restriction, where it accelerates catabolism and increases cellular ATP. However, if energy intake is drastically depleted, as in severe diet restriction, cell resources are not sufficient to reverse the AMP/ATP ratio and AMPK activation now leads to apoptosis (34Shaw R.J. Kosmatka M. Bardeesy N. Hurley R.L. Witters L.A. DePinho R.A. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3329-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). This model of AMPK function explains the opposite effects of moderate (60%) and severe (40%) DR on cognitive function via regulation of hippocampal cell number. Leptin concentrations were not different and declined rapidly following 60 or 40% DR. Nevertheless, the long form of leptin receptor was up-regulated in the hippocampus only when energy was restricted to 60%. This result is in line with other work demonstrating the elevation in hypothalamic leptin receptors under energy restriction and reduced leptin activity (35Fernandez-Galaz C. Fernandez-Agullo T. Perez C. Peralta S. Arribas C. Andres A. Carrascosa J.M. Ros M. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The leptin receptor belongs to the superfamily of cytokine receptors and activates the JAK-STAT pathway of signal transduction. Obese db/db mice are unable to perform JAK-STAT signal transduction because of the absence of the functional long form receptor (36Vaisse C. Halaas J.L. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stoffel M. Friedman J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). When this deficit is reversed by caloric restriction, the receptor capacity is restored (37Wilsey J. Scarpace P.J. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 181: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, under energy restriction up to 60%, leptin signaling is preserved by compensatory mechanisms of receptor up-regulation. More severe DR abolishes this response completely. The fact that leptin treatment could inhibit the phosphorylation of AMPK and restore the cellular, neurochemical, and behavioral deficits following 40% DR demonstrates the importance of its signaling in reversing the effects of severe energy restriction. This suggests a role for leptin as a brake to AMPK overactivity in the hippocampus in order to maintain neural function under such conditions. AMPK regulation of catecholamines implies a novel form of neural modulation. Diet restriction reduces norepinephrine concentrations via AMPK and, as a consequence, contributes to impaired learning and memory. However, restoration of leptin function reduces AMPK activation, increases norepinephrine, and improves cognitive function (38Randt C.T. Quartermain D. Goldstein M. Anagnoste B. Science. 1971; 172: 498-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). AMPK-induced dopamine elevation suggests the involvement of dopamine in the apoptotic effects of AICAR, inasmuch as elevation of dopamine levels has been found to cause apoptosis and decreased survival (39Ziv I. Melamed E. Nardi N. Luria D. Achiron A. Offen D. Barzilai A. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 170: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Indeed, leptin administration reduces dopamine concentrations, inhibits apoptosis, and induces neural survival. The insight emerging from our work is that AMPK reacts to minimize neural insult. When energy depletion starts to threaten hippocampal function, it enhances neurogenesis. However, when AMPK is unable to reduce the AMP/ATP ratio, as in severe diet restriction, it redirects neuronal fate toward apoptosis. AMPK is thus a regulatory factor in the balance between neuronal growth and death in response to nutritional status and stress. The significance of these results is that a certain level of AMPK activation is beneficial, whereas a higher one is destructive; AMPK is thus a “double-edged sword.” Thus, there may be therapeutic benefits to low dose stimulation of AMPK in the treatment of cognitive disorders. In addition, the function of leptin as a brake is crucial for the preservation of neuronal activity during fluctuations in energy status throughout life. Indeed, our results detail how leptin treatment prolongs the survival of mice under severe diet restriction by stimulating anti-apoptotic mechanisms. While there is much information about leptin and the effects of “feasting” and positive energy balance, there is far less concerning its function during “fasting.” It appears that following mild caloric restriction, leptin may improve brain function, an obvious beneficial adaptation to the environment. However, under severe diet restriction these effects fail. The data suggest that, in addition to its many other actions, leptin promotes cognitive function and survival under adverse circumstances. If these results are found to be applicable to Man, then leptin may be used therapeutically in the management of disease states characterized by acute or chronic negative energy balance. These include sepsis and prolonged post-surgical stress and the weight loss associated with severe malnutrition found in developing countries, malabsorption conditions, cancer, or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Thus, leptin, which was considered to be a panacea for obesity, may in fact find a new clinical role in the treatment of stress associated with undernutrition and cachexia. We thank Prof. N. B.

The N-terminal part of rabphilin has recently been shown to function as an effector domain for both Rab27A and Rab3A in PC12 cells (Fukuda, M., Kanno, E., and Yamamoto, A. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 13065–13075), but the function of the C2 domains of rabphilin during secretory vesicle exocytosis is largely unknown. In this study we investigated the interaction between rabphilin and SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors, VAMP-2/synaptobrevin-2, syntaxin IA, and SNAP-25) and SNARE-associated proteins (Munc18-1 and Munc13-1) and found that the C2B domain of rabphilin, but not of other Rab27A-binding proteins with tandem C2 domains (i.e. Slp1-5), directly interacts with a plasma membrane protein, SNAP-25. The interaction between rabphilin and SNAP-25 occurs even in the absence of Ca2+ (EC50 = 0.817 μm SNAP-25), but 0.5 mm Ca2+ increases the affinity for SNAP-25 2-fold (EC50 = 0.405 μm SNAP-25) without changing the Bmax value (1.06 mol of SNAP-25/mol of rabphilin). Furthermore, vesicle dynamics were imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in a single PC12 cell expressing a lumen-targeted pH-insensitive yellow fluorescent protein (Venus), neuropeptide Y-Venus. Expression of the wild-type rabphilin in PC12 cells significantly increased the number of docked vesicles to the plasma membrane without altering the kinetics of individual secretory events, whereas expression of the mutant rabphilin lacking the C2B domain, rabphilin-ΔC2B, decreased the number of docked vesicle or fusing at the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that rabphilin is involved in the docking step of regulated exocytosis in PC12 cells, possibly through interaction between the C2B domain and SNAP-25.

These findings suggest that rabphilin is involved in the docking step of regulated exocytosis in PC12 cells, possibly through interaction between the C2B domain and SNAP-25. Rabphilin was originally identified as a specific GTP-Rab3A-binding protein on secretory granules (1Shirataki H. Kaibuchi K. Sakoda T. Kishida S. Yamaguchi T. Wada K. Miyazaki M. Takai Y. Mol. Cell.

Recent evidence, however, has indicated that rabphilin functions independently of Rab3A.

In addition, the results of a genetic analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans rabphilin and SNARE (syntaxin, SNAP-25, or VAMP/synaptobrevin) double mutants have suggested that rabphilin modulates SNARE function (8Staunton J. Ganetzky B. Nonet M.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9255-9264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is highly possible that rabphilin physically associates with SNARE proteins itself and/or SNARE-associated proteins but that possibility has never been investigated. In this study we systematically investigated the interaction between rabphilin and SNAREs and SNARE-associated proteins by coimmunoprecipitation assays and found that the C2B domain of rabphilin directly interacts with isolated SNAP-25, a target SNARE localized on the plasma membrane. Because there has never been a detailed description of the function of the C2B domain of rabphilin in the recruitment, docking, priming, and fusion of secretory vesicles in live cells, we also investigated the function of the C2B domain of rabphilin on the motion of a single dense core vesicle during exocytosis in PC12 cells by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF, also called evanescent wave or evanescence microscopy) (27Axelrod D.

Expression of the rabphilin-ΔC2B mutant lacking SNAP-25 binding activity inhibited vesicle docking and markedly decreased the number of exocytotic events without affecting the kinetics of vesicle fusion.

After washing the beads five times with 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% Triton X-100, proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-syntaxin I (1/100 dilution), anti-SNAP-25 (1/1000 dilution), anti-VAMP-2 (1/1000 dilution), anti-Munc18 (1/250 dilution), anti-Munc13 (1/250 dilution), anti-Syt I (1/250 dilution), anti-Rab27A (1/250 dilution), anti-Rab27B (2 μg/ml), and HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody (1/10,000 dilution), respectively, as described previously (23Fukuda M.

The immunoreactive bands were visualized by means of enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). COS-7 cell culture and transfection of pEF-T7-rabphilin into COS-7 cells were performed as described previously (37Fukuda M. Kanno E. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 39Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (see also below). Three days after transfection, COS-7 cells (one 10-cm dish) expressing T7-rabphilin were harvested, and cell lysates were obtained as described previously (37Fukuda M. Kanno E. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recombinant T7-rabphilin was affinity-purified from the cell lysates with anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose beads as described previously (11Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 37Fukuda M. Kanno E. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The T7-rabphilin beads were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 400 μl of 5 mg/ml of the solubilized membrane fraction from mouse cerebellum (18Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2,1mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm GTPγS, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. After washing the beads three times with 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors, proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the antibodies indicated as described above. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay in COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C under 5% CO2. pEF-T7, pEF-FLAG, and/or pEF-HA vectors (total of 4 μg of plasmids) were transfected into COS-7 cells (7.5 × 105 cells, the day before transfection/10-cm dish) by using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three days after transfection, cells were harvested and homogenized, and total cell lysates were prepared as described previously (37Fukuda M. Kanno E. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The total cell lysates (400 μl) were incubated with anti-T7 tag antibody-conjugated agarose beads (wet volume 20 μl) with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 1 h, and the proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by 10% (or 12.5%) SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with HRP-conjugated anti-T7 tag antibody (1/10,000 dilution), HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1/10,000 dilution), and/or HRP-conjugated anti-HA tag antibody (1/10,000 dilution) as described previously (33Fukuda M.

Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The blots shown in this paper are representative of at least two independent experiments. Direct Interaction between T7-rabphilin and GST-SNAP-25—The T7-rabphilin beads (wet volume, 10 μl) were prepared as described above. GST-SNAP-25 was expressed in bacteria and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads by standard protocols (18Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The concentration of GST-SNAP-25 was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories), using bovine serum albumin as a reference. The T7-rabphilin beads were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 400 μl of various concentrations of GST-SNAP-25 (0.02–5 μm) in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EGTA (or 0.5 mm CaCl2), and proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The intensity of the bands on the gel was captured and quantified with Lane Analyzer software (version 3.0) (ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan). All statistical analyses and curve fitting were performed with a GraphPad Prism computer program (version 4.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). TIRF Microscopy—PC12 cells were cultured as described above (37Fukuda M. Kanno E. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 403: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For TIRF imaging, PC12 cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, and cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of pVenus-N1-NPY, and 2 μg of pmRFP-C1, pmRFP-C1-gk-rabphilin, or pmRFP-C1-gk-rabphilin-ΔC2B by using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The imaging was performed in a modified Ringer buffer at 37 °C (130 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2,10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Stimulation with high KCl was achieved by perfusion of 70 mm KCl containing Ringer buffer (NaCl was reduced to maintain the osmolarity). We monitored exocytosis of NPY-Venus at the single vesicle level by using a TIRF microscope similar to that described previously (28Tsuboi T. Zhao C. Terakawa S. Rutter G.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1307-1310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 31Tsuboi T. McMahon H.T. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47115-47124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In brief, a high numerical aperture objective lens (Plan Apochromatic, 100×, numerical aperture = 1.45, infinity-corrected, OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan) was mounted on an inverted microscope (IX71, OLYM-PUS), and incident light for total internal reflection illumination was introduced from the high numerical aperture objective lens through a single mode optical fiber and two illumination lenses (IX2-RFAEVA-2, OLYMPUS). To observe the NPY-Venus fluorescence images, we used a diode-pumped solid state 488-nm laser (HPU50100, 20 milliwatt, Furukawa Electronic, Chiba, Japan) for total internal fluorescence illumination and a band pass filter (HQ535/30m, Chroma, Rockingham, VT) as an emission filter. The laser beam was passed through an electromagnetically driven shutter (VMM-D3J, Unibritz, Rochester, NY), and the shutter was opened synchronously with electron multiplier charge-coupled device camera (C9100-02, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) exposure controlled by MetaMorph software (version 6.3, Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA). Images were acquired every 200 ms or otherwise as indicated. To analyze the TIRF imaging data, single exocytotic events were manually selected, and the average fluorescence intensity of individual vesicles in a 0.7 × 0.7-μm square positioned over the center of the vesicle was calculated. The number of fusion events was counted manually during a 5-min period. Data are reported as means ± S.E. of at least five individual experiments. Means were compared by one-way analysis of variance with GraphPad Prism software. Confocal Imaging—Localization of mRFP-rabphilin or mRFP-rabphilin-ΔC2B on NPY-Venus-containing dense core vesicles in PC12 cells was examined by a confocal microscope (Fluoview 500, OLYMPUS). Co-purification of SNAP-25 and Rab27A with Rabphilin from PC12 Cell Lysates—To investigate the possible interaction between rabphilin and SNAREs, i.e. syntaxin I, SNAP-25, and VAMP-2, or SNARE-associated proteins, i.e. Munc13 and Munc18, GST-tagged rabphilin was transiently expressed in PC12 cells, and GST-rabphilin and rabphilin-interacting molecules were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Immunoblot analyses showed that both SNAP-25 and Rab27A were co-purified with GST-rabphilin (closed and open arrowheads, respectively, lane 2 in Fig. 1A), but no syntaxin I, VAMP-2, Munc13, Munc18, or Syt I was detected. By contrast, SNAP-25 was not co-purified with GST alone (Fig. 1A, lane 1), GST-Noc2, another Rab27A-binding protein without tandem C2 domains in PC12 cells (13Fukuda M. Kanno E. Yamamoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13065-13075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Cheviet S. Coppola T. Haynes L.P. Burgoyne R.D. Regazzi R. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1906-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (see also supplemental Fig. 1), although Noc2 and Slp4-a did interact with Rab27A. Similarly, both SNAP-25 and Rab27B (a closely related isoform of Rab27A expressed in brain) (41Chen D. Guo J. Miki T. Tachibana M. Gahl W.A. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1997; 60: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were co-purified with T7-rabphilin from the solubilized membrane fraction of mouse cerebellum (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Interaction between rabphilin and SNAP-25 was further investigated by co-immunoprecipitation assay using COS-7 cells, which do not endogenously express either rabphilin or neuronal SNAREs (or SNARE-associated proteins) (35Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30351-30358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, agarose beads coupled with T7-rabphilin were incubated with COS-7 cell lysates containing FLAG-syntaxin IA, FLAG-SNAP-25, FLAG-VAMP-2, or FLAG-Munc18-1, in the presence and absence of HA-Rab27A, and FLAG-tagged proteins and HA-Rab27A that had bound to the beads were detected by immunoblotting with the specific antibodies indicated (Fig. 2). As expected, rabphilin specifically interacted with SNAP-25, but not with other SNAREs or Munc18-1, irrespective of the presence of Rab27A (Fig. 2, third panel, lanes 2 and 6). It should be noted that SNAP-25 did not interact with Slp1-5 (11Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 14Fukuda M. J. Biochem. 2005; 137: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 36Kuroda T.S.

Commun. 2002; 293: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), another Rab27A-binding protein with tandem C2 domains at the C terminus (supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that rabphilin is the only Rab27A-binding protein that physically associates with SNAP-25. The C2B Domain of Rabphilin Functions as a SNAP-25-binding Site—Next, we attempted to map the minimal SNAP-25-binding site in rabphilin. To do so, we prepared three truncated mutants of rabphilin, i.e. the RBD, C2A domain, and C2B domain, and tested their SNAP-25 binding activity by co-immunoprecipitation assay using COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, the C2B domain interacted with SNAP-25, the same as the full-length protein (third panel, lanes 1 and 4), but the C2A domain and the RBD did not. Similarly, the rabphilin-ΔC2B mutant did not interact with SNAP-25, but th"

In this study, we report the isolation of a galactomannan fraction associated to membrane preparations from A. fumigatus mycelium by a lipid anchor. Specific chemical and enzymatic degradations and mass spectrometry analysis showed that the lipid anchor is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). The lipid part is an inositol phosphoceramide containing mainly C18-phytosphingosine and monohydroxylated lignoceric acid (2OH-C24:0 fatty acid). GPI glycan is a tetramannose structure linked to a glucosamine residue: Manα1–2Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcN. The galactomannan polymer is linked to the GPI structure throught the mannan chain. The GPI structure is a type 1, closely related to the one previously described for the GPI-anchored proteins of A. fumigatus.

Aspergillus fumigatus has become over the past decade the most prevalent airborne fungal pathogen causing fatal invasive infections in immunocompromised patients (1Latgé J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 310-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the characteristic components of this fungus is composed of a linear mannan chain with a tetra-α-mannoside repeating unit and side chains of β1–5 galactofuranoside residues (2Latgé J.P. Kobayashi H. Debeaupuis J.P. Diaquin M. Sarfati J. Wieruszeski J.M. Parra E. Fournet B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5424-5433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The galactomannan from A. fumigatus has been described as a free polysaccharide found in the culture medium, and it is also covalently associated to the cell wall through the β1–3 glucan net and plays a role in the structural organization of the cell wall (2Latgé J.P.

During the search of lipid molecules that could be an anchor for the galactomannan, we isolated a membrane bound fraction that contained galactomannan.

A. fumigatus, strain CBS 144-89 was grown in a 15-L fermenter in 2% glucose and 1% mycopeptone (Biokar Diagnostics, Pantin, France) for 24 h at 25 °C as described previously (6Hartland R.P.

Total membrane preparation from mycelium was done as described previously (7Fontaine T. Magnin T. Melhert A. Lamont D. Latgé J.P. Ferguson M.A.J. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Lipids and polar glycolipids were extracted from membrane preparation by an organic extraction. A chloroform/methanol 1/1 (v/v) solution was added to the membrane suspension to reach a final concentration of chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3 v/v/v). The mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature to extract lipids, then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in the same solvent, and the extraction was repeated once. The final pellet was dried, ground, and suspended in 50 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 5 mm sodium azide and incubated with 50 mg of protease from Streptomyces griseus (4.9 units/mg, Sigma, previously incubated for 30 min) at 37 °C for 48 h. The reaction was stopped by heating (5 min at 100 °C). Propan-1-ol was added to the final concentration of 5% and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (5,000 × g for 10 min). The soluble material was fractionated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on an octyl-Sepharose column (25 × 1.6 cm, Sigma). The supernatant was deposited onto the column equilibrated with 5% propan-1-ol in 100 mm ammonium acetate at the flow rate of 10 ml/h. After the elution of the unbound fraction, bound products were eluted with a linear gradient of 5–60% propan-1-ol in 100 mm ammonium acetate (300 ml). Carbohydrates were detected by the phenol sulfuric acid procedure (8Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40620) Google Scholar). Galactofuran was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (2Latgé J.P. Kobayashi H. Debeaupuis J.P. Diaquin M. Sarfati J. Wieruszeski J.M. Parra E. Fournet B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5424-5433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bound positive fractions were pooled, dialyzed against water, and freeze-dried. Dried residue was solubilized by 50 ml of butanol-saturated water, then five partitions with 20 ml of water-saturated butanol were performed to remove contaminating glycolipids. The absence of protein and glycolipid was observed by SDS-PAGE and TLC, respectively. The aqueous-phase containing the lipogalactomannan was then dialyzed against water and freeze-dried. The molecular weight of lipogalactomannan was estimated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 12 column (29 × 1.2 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mm ammonium acetate containing 30% (v/v) propan-1-ol at 0.2 ml/min. The products were detected using a refractometer (Gilson, model 132). Dextran T10, T40, and T70 (Amersham Biosciences) were used as molecular weight standards. Products obtained after acetolysis of the lipogalactomannan were separated by gel filtration chromatography on a HW40S column (80 × 1.4 cm, TosoHaas) equilibrated with 0.25% acetic acid at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The products were detected using a refractometer. Maltooligosaccharides (Glucidex 19 from Roquette Frères, Lestrem, France) were used as molecular weight standards. Phosphate was quantified according to Ames (9Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3021) Google Scholar). Total hexoses were quantified by the phenol-sulfuric acid procedure using mannose and galactose as standards (8Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40620) Google Scholar). Neutral hexoses were identified by GLC as alditol acetates obtained after hydrolysis (4 n trifluoroacetic acid, 100 °C, for 4 h) (10Sawardeker J.S. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A. Anal. Chem. 1967; 37: 1602-1604Crossref Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). Glucosamine and myo-inositol were quantified by GLC-MS after hydrolysis (6 n HCl, 110 °C, 20 h), N-acetylation, and trimethylsilylation, using scyllo-inositol as standard (11Ferguson M.A. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 349-383Google Scholar). Lipid analysis was performed by GLC-MS on the HF-treated lipogalactomannan (see below). Fatty acids and the sphingosine base were released by methanolysis (1 n HCl in MeOH, 80 °C, 20 h). Fatty acids were extracted with heptane and analyzed by GLC-MS after trimethylsilylation. The sphingosine base containing methanol phase was N-acetylated, trimethylsilylated, and analyzed by GLC-MS (11Ferguson M.A. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 349-383Google Scholar). Methylation of galactomannan fraction was performed using the lithium methyl sulfinyl carbanion procedure (12Fontaine T. Talmont F. Dutton G.G. Fournet B. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides were methylated using the sodium hydroxide procedure (13Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3190) Google Scholar). Glycolipids, containing a glucosamine residue, were peracetylated with a pyridine/acetic anhydride solution (50/200 μl) overnight at room temperature prior to the methylation procedure. Methyl ethers were analyzed by GLC-MS as polyol acetates (14Björndal H. Hellerquist C.G. Lindherg B. Svensson S. Angew. Chem. Int. 1970; 9: 610-619Crossref Scopus (707) Google Scholar) and/or as methyl glycosides (15Fournet B. Strecker G. Leroy Y. Montreuil J. Anal. Chem. 1981; 116: 489-502Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) Digestions—1.5 mg of purified lipogalactomannan was dissolved in 100 μlofimidazole/acetate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm sodium azide and 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with 5 μl of PI-PLC (Glyko, 200–300 units/ml) at 37 °C for 24 h. Digested products were deposited onto an octyl-Sepharose column (6 × 1.4 cm) equilibrated with 5% propan-1-ol in 100 mm ammonium acetate. Bound products were then eluted with 50% propan-1-ol in 100 mm ammonium acetate. For the chemical analysis of PI-PLC released lipid moiety, a similar digestion was done on 100 μgof sample without Triton X-100. Released lipid moiety was extracted with water-saturated butanol and analyzed by GLC-MS. Aqueous HF Treatment—To cleave the phosphoester bond, 100 μgof dried purified lipogalactomannan was treated by 100 μl of 50% aqueous HF for 48 h on an ice bath (11Ferguson M.A. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 349-383Google Scholar). Released lipids were extracted with water-saturated butanol. Nitrous Acid Deamination (11Ferguson M.A. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 349-383Google Scholar)—0.5–1.5 mg of sample was dissolved in 200 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4. Aliquots of 100 μl of freshly prepared 0.5 m sodium nitrite were added at hourly intervals and incubated at 50 °C for 3 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness. Released PI was extracted with water-saturated butanol and purified on a small silica column (200 μl of Kieselgel 60, 0.063–0.2 mm, Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), in a glass Pasteur pipette) as described previously (7Fontaine T. Magnin T. Melhert A. Lamont D. Latgé J.P. Ferguson M.A.J. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Water-soluble products were deposited onto an octyl-Sepharose column and eluted as described for extracts submited to PI-PLC digestion. Partial Acid Hydrolysis—10 mg of lipogalactomannan was treated with 50 mm HCl at 100 °C for 15 h. After neutralization with aqueous ammonia, released glycolipids were isolated by HPLC on a C-4 reverse phase column (10 × 4.6 mm, 120 Å, 5 μm, Uptisphere Interchim) using the following conditions: flow 0.25 ml/min; buffer A, 1% propan-1-ol in 20 mm ammonium acetate; buffer B, 80% propan-1-ol in 20 mm ammonium acetate; gradient 0–10 min, isocratic (100% buffer A); 10–40 min, linear gradient (100% buffer A, 0% buffer B to 0% buffer A, 100% buffer B), 40–50 min isocratic (100% buffer B). Sugars were detected by orcinol sulfuric acid on spotting of fraction (1 μl) on silica sheet. Then fractions containing sugar were analyzed by ES-MS and the methylation procedure. Jack Bean α-Mannosidase (JBAM) Degradation—500 μg of HCl-treated lipogalactomannan were dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mm NaOAc, pH 4.0, buffer containing 5 mm sodium azide and incubated with 20 μl of JBAM (95 units/ml, Sigma) at 37 °C for 24 h. Released lipid moiety was extracted with water-saturated butanol and then purified on a small silica column. Acetolysis—500 μg of purified lipogalactomannan were peracetylated by treatment with formamide/acetic anhydride/pyridine (2/2/1, v/v/v) overnight at room temperature, then dialyzed against water and freezedried. The peracetylated products were treated with 200 μl of an acetic acid/acetic anhydride/sulfuric acid solution (10:10:1 v/v/v) at 37 °C for 7 h (11Ferguson M.A. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 349-383Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by addition of 800 μl of an ice-cold pyridine/water mixture (1/3 v/v). Acetolysed products were extracted with chloroform and the organic phase was washed with water and then concentrated to dryness. De-O-acylation was performed in 300 mm NaOH containing NaBH4 (10 mg/ml) overnight at room temperature. The excess of reagent was destroyed by addition of 10% acetic acid. Released lipid moiety was extracted by the butanol-water partitioning. TLC Analysis—TLC was performed on precoated aluminum-backed silica 60 HPTLC plates (Merck). Plates were developed at room temperature using chloroform/methanol/30% aqueous NH3/1 m NH4Ac/water (180/140/9/9/23 by volume) as the solvent (16Schneider P. Ferguson M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 614-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After drying, sugars were revealed by spraying with orcinol/H2SO4 reagent. GLC and Mass Spectrometry—GLC was performed on a Delsi 200 instrument with a flame ionization detector using a capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter) filled with a EC™-1 (Alltech) under the following conditions: gas vector and pressure, helium 0.7 bar; temperature program 120–180 °C at 2 °C/min, 180–240 °C at 4 °C/min. GLC-MS was performed on an Automass II apparatus (Finigan) coupled to a CarloErba gas chromatograph (model 8000top), using a capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter) filled with a EC™-1 (Alltech) under the following conditions: gas vector and flow rate, helium 2 ml/min; temperature program for inositol and monosaccharide analysis: 100–200 °C at 5 °C/min, 200–240 °C at 15 °C/min, and 240 °C for 5 min; temperature program for sphingosine base and fatty acid analysis: 100–200 °C at 10 °C/min, 200–260 °C at 15 °C/min, and 260 °C for 13 min. Electrospray-Mass Spectrometry—All electrospray-mass measurements were carried out in negative-ion mode on a triple quadrupole instrument (Micromass Ltd., Altrincham, UK) fitted with an atmospheric pressure ionization electrospray source. A mixture of polypropylene glycol (range 30–2,000 daltons) was used to calibrate the quadrupole mass spectrometer. The samples were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1/2) at a concentration of 1–10 pmol/μl. Solutions were infused using a Harvad syringe pump at a flow rate of 3 μl·min–1.Quadrupole was scanned from 400 to 2000 Da with a scan duration of 3–5 s and a scan delay of 0.1 s. The samples were sprayed using 3.25 kV needle voltage, and the declustering (cone) was set at 70 V. For collision-induced dissociation experiments, the pressure of argon in the cell was set at 2.7.10–3 mbar, and the collision energy was set to values ranging from 40 to 70 V depending of the studied daughter ions. Matrix-assisted Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectra were measured on a reflectron-type Vision 2000 time of flight mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany). Samples were mounted on an x,y movable stage allowing irradiation of selected areas. A nitrogen laser with an emission wavelength of 337 nm and 3-ns pulse duration was used. The spectrum was recorded in the positive ion mode and accelerated to an energy of 10 keV before entering the flight tube. Ions were prepared by mixing directly on the target 1 μl of oligosaccharide solution (about 25 pmol) and 1 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix solution (12 mg/ml) dissolved in CH3OH/10 mm NaCl (80:20 v/v). Purification and Composition of the Lipogalactomannan—The crude membrane fraction of A. fumigatus mycelium was treated with a chloroform/methanol/water mixture, and the pellet was digested with a protease mixture. Soluble material was fractionated by a hydrophobic interaction. The major phenol-sulfuric acid-positive peak, bound to the octyl-Sepharose column, was also positive with the anti-galactofuranose antibody detection (Fig. 1). The purified fraction had an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa on a Superose 12 column (data not shown) and represented 0.04 ± 0.01% of total mycelium dry weight. Colorimetric assays and GLC analysis showed that the octyl-bound fraction was mainly composed of mannose and galactose residues in a ratio 3:2 and for this reason was called lipogalactomannan (LGM). The LGM fraction contains a small amount of glucosamine, phosphate, myo-inositol, 2-monohydroxy-C24:0 fatty acid, and C18-phytosphingosine (data not shown). The presence of these compounds suggested that the polysaccharide was anchored to the membrane by a GPI anchor (7Fontaine T. Magnin T. Melhert A. Lamont D. Latgé J.P. Ferguson M.A.J. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A PI-PLC- or HNO2-treated lipogalactomannan did not bind to the octyl-Sepharose column (data not shown). Taken all together, these results showed that the galactomannan moiety was bound to a GPI anchor. Analysis of the Carbohydrate Structure of the Lipogalactomannan—To determine the monosaccharide linkages, the membrane-bound polysaccharide fraction was permethylated. Methyl ethers analysis revealed the presence of mannose residues monosubstituted in position 2 or 6 and disubstituted in position 2,3 or 2,6 as described for the secreted galactomannan isolated from A. fumigatus culture filtrate (TABLE ONE) (2Latgé J.P. Kobayashi H. Debeaupuis J.P. Diaquin M. Sarfati J. Wieruszeski J.M. Parra E. Fournet B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5424-5433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Terminal galactofuranose has also been identified. 2,3,6-Tri-O-methyl-1,4,5-tri-O-acetyl-galactitol indicated the presence of galactofuranose residues substituted in position 5 or galactopyranose in position 4. The specific detection with the anti-galactofuran monoclonal antibody and the sensitivity of galactose residue to a mild acid hydrolysis and/or aqueous HF treatment (TABLE ONE) indicated that all galactose residues were in furanic configuration similar to those described in the secreted galactomannan (2Latgé J.P. Kobayashi H. Debeaupuis J.P. Diaquin M. Sarfati J. Wieruszeski J.M. Parra E. Fournet B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5424-5433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).TABLE ONEMolar ratio of methyl ethers obtained after permethylation of the native, HF-treated and HCl-treated lipogalactomannan isolated from A. fumigatus membrane preparationsMethyl ethersSugar linkagesMolar ratioNativeHF-treatedHCl-treated2,3,4,6-Mant-Manp>0.10.21.03,4,6-Man2-Manp2.731.52,3,4-Man6-Manp1113,4-Man2,6-Manp1.30.40.34,6-Man2,3-Manp0.40.32,3,5,6-Galt-Galf1.30.22,3,6-Gal5-Galf3.3>0.13,4,6-GlcN(Me)t-GlcN0.83,6-GlcN(Me)4-GlcN0.4 Open table in a new tab To confirm the similarity of structures, acetolysis was performed on the lipogalactomannan and secreted galactomannan. Analysis of released products by gel filtration (Fig. 2), matrix-assisted desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and GLC analysis revealed the same pattern of degraded products such as mainly galactose residue and a tetra-α1–2-mannoside from both polysaccharide fractions. All these data indicated that the membrane-bound galactomannan from A. fumigatus has the same structure as the soluble polymer. Analysis of the Lipid Anchor of the Lipogalactomannan—The lipid moiety, released by nitrous acid deamination from the lipogalactomannan, purified by butanol/water partition and by chromatography on a small silica column, was analyzed by ES-MS-MS as described previously (7Fontaine T. Magnin T. Melhert A. Lamont D. Latgé J.P. Ferguson M.A.J. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ES-MS spectrum of the PI fraction (Fig. 3A) revealed one principal [M–H]– pseudomolecular ion at m/z = 924 and four minor ions at m/z = 908, 910, 938, and 952. The fragmentation of each PI compounds produced only two daughter ions at m/z = 241 [inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate]– and at m/z = 259 [inositol monophosphate]– (Fig. 3B). The presence of these daughter ions and the absence of the fatty acid carboxylate ion and/or 1-O-alkylglycerol-2,3-cyclic phosphate ion is characteristic of inositol phosphoceramides (IPCs) (17Treumann A. Guther M.L. Schneider P. Ferguson M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 76: 213-235PubMed Google Scholar). From the measured mass and taking into account the identified lipid compounds, we concluded that the main PI structure is made of a C18-phytosphingosine and a 2-monohydroxylated C24:0 fatty acid. The minor components that differ by a mass of 14, 16, or 28 reflected the variability of size of fatty acid or the absence of hydroxyl group that was observed by the fatty acid analysis (data not shown). To confirm the position of glucosamine residue, the lipogalactomannan fraction was submitted to a mild HCl acid hydrolysis followed by a JBAM digestion. The ES-MS spectrum of the released lipid moiety revealed one principal [M–H]– pseudomolecular ion at m/z = 1086 (Fig. 4A). Except for minor ions due to the variability of the aliphatic chain (m/z = 1072, 1100, and 1114), two minor [M–H]– pseudomolecular ions at m/z = 1248 and 1410 were observed and corresponded to an increase of 162 and 324 suggesting the presence of 1 and 2 hexose residues, respectively. The fragmentation of the ion at m/z = 1086 produced two daughter ions at m/z = 402 [hexosamine-inositol-1,2cyclic phosphate]– and at m/z = 420 [hexosamine-inositol monophosphate]– (Fig. 4B). Since glucosamine has been identified in the LGM fraction, and since the ion mass at m/z = 1086 corresponds to the presence of an hexosamine residue linked to the identified PI, the presence of the two daughter ions is characteristic of the glucosamine linked to the inositol phosphoceramide. The fragmentation of the ion at m/z = 1248 produced also two daughter ions at m/z = 564 [hexose-hexosamine-inositol-1,2cyclic phosphate]– and at m/z = 582 [hexose-hexosamine-inositol-monophosphate]– (Fig. 4C). Since only mannose has been identified as hexose in the butanol phase after the HCl-JBAM treatment, these daughter ions are characteristic of the Man-GlcN-linked to the inositol phosphoceramide. The LGM fraction was submitted to acetolysis, which cleaves preferentially the 1–6 linkage. The ES-MS of the butanol-soluble-resistant products revealed two main [M–H]–, pseudomolecular ions at m/z = 965 and at m/z = 1290 (Fig. 5A). Minor ions at m/z = 803 and at m/z = 1128 correspond to the loss of 162 from the two main ions, respectively, suggesting the loss of an hexose residue. The fragmentation of the ion at m/z = 1290 produced two main daughter ions at m/z = 606 [hexose-N-acetylhexosamine-inositol-1,2cyclic phosphate]– and at m/z = 624 [hexose-N-acetyl-hexosamine-inositol monophosphate]– (Fig. 5B). Since only mannose was identified as hexose in this fraction, and since acetolysis resulted in the N-acetylation of the glucosamine residue, the daughter ions are characteristic of the Man-GlcNAc linked to the inositolphosphoceramide. The fragmentation of the ion at m/z = 965 produced three daughter ions at m/z 606, at m/z = 624, and at m/z = 420 (Fig. 5C). The ions at m/z 606 and at m/z = 624 are similar to those obtained by the fragmentation of the parental ion at m/z = 1290, indicating a same structure of the glycan part in both parental ions. The mass difference between this both parental ions corresponds to the substitution of the 2-monohydroxyl C24:0 fatty acid by an acetyl group, indicating that the acetolysis cleaved the acetamide linkage. The presence of one mannose residue linked to the N-acetylglucosamine after acetolysis indicated that this first mannose residue is substituted in position 6. After mild acid hydrolysis (50 mm HCl for 15 h at 100 °C) without JBAM digestion, the ES-MS spectrum of HPLC-purified glycolipids revealed 10 main pseudomolecular ions at m/z = 1086, 1248, 1410, 1572, 1734, 1896, 2058, 2220, 2382, and 2544 (Fig. 6). The ion at m/z = 1086 corresponds to the GlcN-IPC described in the legend to Fig. 4. The increase of ion mass of 162, 324, 486, 648, 810, 972, 1134, 1296, and 1458 indicated the presence of a mixture of oligosaccharides containing 0–9 hexoses linked to the GlcN-IPC. Monosaccharide linkage analysis, done after peracetylation, permethylation, and methanolysis, revealed the presence of terminal glucosamine, 4-substituted glucosamine, terminal mannose, 2-subsituted mannose, 6-substituted mannose residues (TABLE ONE). According to these ES-MS data, the terminal glucosamine residue came from the GlcN-IPC. The presence of the 4-substituted glucosamine residue indicates that the first mannose residue is linked in position 4 to the glucosamine. Taking into account the results from acetolysis experiment, the 6-substituted mannose corresponds to the first mannose residue in the Man2–9GlcN-IPC structures. The quantity of 2-substituted mannose, higher than the one of 6-substituted mannose, indicated that at least the two following mannose residues (third and fourth) are substituted in position 2. All of these mannose residues, removed by a JBAM digestion, are linked in α-anomeric configuration (data not shown). After mild acid hydrolysis, the presence of structures containing more than 5 mannose residues linked to GlcN-IPC and the absence of phosphoethanolamine group excluded the putative contamination from GPI-anchored proteins (7Fontaine T. Magnin T. Melhert A. Lamont D. Latgé J.P. Ferguson M.A.J. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of A. fumigatus LGM to the PI-PLC indicated that the linkage between GlcN and inositol is not α1–2 (18Lewis K.A. Garigapati V. Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8836-8841Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Taken all together, these results were in agreement with the following GPI structure: galactomannan-Manα1–2Manα1–2Manα1–6Manα1–4GlcN-inositol-P-ceramide. The GPI anchor was linked to the α-mannan chain of the galactomannan, which contains the same repeat unit. The small amount of 2,6-disubstituted mannose (TABLE ONE) suggests the putative presence of a mannose as a side chain in this structure GPI structures have been observed in all eukaryotic cells. In mammalian and plant cells, GPI are involved in the anchoring of proteins in the lipid bilayer by a common core Man3-GlcN-PI. In parasite cells, in addition to GPI-anchored proteins, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides have also been described to be GPI-anchored. To date, in fungi only proteins had been found to be GPI-anchored (7Fontaine T. Magnin T. Melhert A. Lamont D. Latgé J.P. Ferguson M.A.J. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Frankhauser C. Homans S.W. Thomas-Oates M cConville M.J. Desponds C. Conzelmann A. Ferguson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26365-26374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Herein, we described the first fungal polysaccharide to be linked to a GPI. Since many other ascomycetes have a galactomannan with similar structures (20Ikuta K. Shibata N. Blake J.S. Dahl M.V. Nelson R.D. Hisamichi K. Kobayashi H. Suzuki S. Okawa Y. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Unkefer C.J. Gander J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 685-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bardalaye P.C. Nordin J.H.

Chem. 1974; 249: 2063-2072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it can be expected now that other fungi also possess GPI-anchored polysaccharide. The role of these polysaccharides in fungal life remains to be understood. The lipid moiety of the LGM and proteins GPIs of A. fumigatus is the same ceramide (7Fontaine T. Magnin T. Melhert A. Lamont D. Latgé J.P. Ferguson M.A.J. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, anchoring of the GPI to the protein and polysaccharide is different; no phosphoethanolamine group has been identified on the LGM anchor, and the fifth α1–3linked mannose residue of the GPI structure of anchored proteins is replaced by the galactomannan in the LGM structure. Nevertheless, in contrast to the Leishmania lipophosphoglycan and to the Crithidia fasciculata lipoarabinogalactan, where the second mannose residue is α1–3-linked (24Turco S.J. Orlandi Jr., P.A. Homans S.W. Ferguson M.A. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6711-6715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schneider P. Treumann A. Milne K.G. McConville M.J. Zitzmann N. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it is the first time that a polysaccharide is linked to a GPI type 1 structure, as described for GPI-anchored proteins. IPC structures from the LGM are similar to the glycosylinositol phosphoceramide (GIPC) described in A. fumigatus (26Levery S.B. Toledo M.S. Straus A.H. Takahashi H.K. Rapid Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 2001; 15: 2240-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Numerous GIPCs have been described at the cell membrane of other filamentous fungi and yeast cells but are absent from mammalian cells. The ceramide structure of these glycosphingolipids seems conserved between species with the presence of a phytosphingosine, associated to a saturated fatty acid, mainly the 2-hydroxylignoceric acid (2OH-C24:0) (27Aaronson L.R. Martin C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 735: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Bar K. Lester R.L.

Yamamoto K. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 461-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the lipid moiety, the glycan moiety is heterogenous between fungal species with the presence of mannose, galactose in a pyranic or furanic configuration, and even fucose residue in higher mushrooms (36Jennemann R. Geyer R. Sandhoff R. Gschwind R.M. Levery S.B. Grone H.J. Wiegandt H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1190-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Usually, glycans of GIPC contain 2–6 hexose residues. Up to 18 mannose residues have been exceptionnally found in the phospholipomannan of C. albicans (33Trinel P.A. Maes E. Zanetta J.P. Delplace F. Coddeville B. Jouault T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37260-37271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Two types of GIPC have been described in fungal cells: (i) MIPC, where the glycan is linked to the IPC through an α-mannose residue, and (ii) ZGL (zwitterionic glycosphingolipid), where the glycan moiety is linked to the IPC through a glucosamine residue (35Aoki K. Uchiyama R. Itonori S. Sugita M. Che F.S. Isogai A. Hada N. Hada J. Takeda T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 461-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Toledo M.S. Levery S.B. Straus A.H. Takahashi H.K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast to LGM structure, in this latter ZGL structure only described in three fungal species, the glucosamine residue is α1–2-linked to the inositol ring. The galactomannan from A. fumigatus is mainly constituted by the polymerization of a tetramannoside unit containing two side chains of β-d-galactofuranose residues (2Latgé J.P. Kobayashi H. Debeaupuis J.P. Diaquin M. Sarfati J. Wieruszeski J.M. Parra E. Fournet B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5424-5433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a repeat unit suggests a biosynthesis of the tetramannoside on a acceptor prior to the polymerization of the mannan chain. Our data suggest that the acceptor could be a GPI moiety. Enzymes involved in this biochemical pathway are totally unknown. A glycosyltransferase activity able to mannosylate the GlcN-PI, recently observed in an A. fumigatus cellular lysate, could play a role in this biochemical event. This activity, independent of the dolichol phosphomannose synthesis and of the acylation of the inositol ring, is not involved in the biosynthesis of GPI intermediates of GPI-anchored proteins (38Fontaine T. Smith T.K. Crossman A. Brimacombe J.S. Latgé J.P. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15267-15275Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These data suggest that GPI anchor of LGM could be synthesized in an independent biosynthetic pathway using GDP-Man as substrate donor, as it was speculated for ZGL in Acremonium and Trichoderma sp. (35Aoki K. Uchiyama R. Itonori S. Sugita M. Che F.S. Isogai A. Hada N. Hada J. Takeda T. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 461-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A. fumigatus galactomannan has now been described in three different forms: (i) soluble and recovered in the culture medium (2Latgé J.P. Kobayashi H. Debeaupuis J.P. Diaquin M. Sarfati J. Wieruszeski J.M. Parra E. Fournet B. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5424-5433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which does not contain a lipid anchor (data not shown), (ii) covalently linked to the cell wall through the β1–3 glucan network (3Fontaine T. Simenel C. Dubreucq G. Adam O. Delepierre M. Lemoine J. Vorgias C.E. Diaquin M. Latgé J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27594-27607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and (iii) GPI-anchored to the membrane. These forms present the same carbohydrate chemical structure, suggesting a common biosynthetic pathway. The galactomannan seems secreted to the plasma membrane with a GPI anchor. At this stage, the galactomannan could be transfered to β1–3 glucan chain as it has been proposed for some yeast GPI-anchored protein (39Klis F.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 851-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), or the galactomannan could be released in the culture medium by a specific glycosidase. Enzymes putatively involved in such in block transfer are actively searched."
https://openalex.org/W2096107132,"There is evidence that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) interacting proteins play critical roles in the proper expression and function of CFTR. The Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor isoform 1 (NHERF1) was the first identified CFTR-binding protein. Here we further clarify the role of NHERF1 in the regulation of CFTR activity in two human bronchial epithelial cell lines: the normal, 16HBE14o-, and the homozygous ΔF508 CFTR, CFBE41o-. Confocal analysis in polarized cell monolayers demonstrated that NHERF1 distribution was associated with the apical membrane in 16HBE14o- cells while being primarily cytoplasmic in CFBE41o- cells. Transfection of 16HBE14o- monolayers with vectors encoding for wild-type (wt) NHERF1 increased both apical CFTR expression and apical protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent CFTR-mediated chloride efflux, whereas transfection with NHERF1 mutated in the binding groove of the PDZ domains or truncated for the ERM domain inhibited both the apical CFTR expression and the CFTR-dependent chloride efflux. These data led us to hypothesize an important role for NHERF1 in regulating CFTR localization and stability on the apical membrane of 16HBE14o- cell monolayers. Importantly, wt NHERF1 overexpression in confluent ΔF508 CFBE41o- and ΔF508 CFT1-C2 cell monolayers induced both a significant redistribution of CFTR from the cytoplasm to the apical membrane and a PKA-dependent activation of CFTR-dependent chloride secretion.

The most common mutation of the gene associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) causes deletion of phenylalanine at residue 508 (ΔF508). This mutation results in the synthesis of a functional but improperly folded CFTR protein that is targeted for degradation mainly via the ubiquitin-protea-some pathway in the ER (1Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar) and, in some tissues, only a negligible amount of ΔF508 CFTR can reach the plasma membrane of CF cells (2Kalin N.

A sizable fraction of newly synthesized wild-type (wt) CFTR is also rapidly degraded without ever reaching the plasma membrane, and only 20-30% of the newly synthesized wt CFTR protein, after passing the ER quality control, is exported from the Golgi to the apical membrane as fully glycosylated CFTR (4Lukacs G.L. Mohamed A. Kartner N. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Once delivered to the plasma membrane, CFTR is subjected to rapid internalization to a pool of sub-apical vesicles that can be either recycled to the plasma membrane or delivered to lysosomes for degradation. It has been observed that activation of PKA, in addition to inducing CFTR channel activity, also induces the translocation of CFTR from the sub-apical compartment to the plasma membrane (5Howard M.

However, this process seems to be tissue-specific, because in some cell systems PKA activation is able to regulate only the activity of CFTR channels already resident in the plasma membrane (8Moyer B.D.

PDZ domain proteins have been proposed to be involved in regulation of CFTR localization and activity via their organization of multiprotein complexes at the plasma membrane (11Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and regulating, in this way, various functions. CFTR interacts with several PDZ domain proteins such as NHERF, CAP70, and CAL via its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (12Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T. Blitzer J.T. Rahman N. Welsh M.J.

Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) is a 50-kDa membrane protein initially identified as the cofactor required for cAMP inhibition of NHE3 (15Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6123-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but it is also known to interact with a wide variety of channels, transporters, and receptors (16Weinman E.J. Minkoff C. Shenolikar S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F393-F399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of NHERF with the C terminus PDZ target domain of CFTR (12Hall R.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Premont R.T.

In addition to PDZ domain interactions, NHERF interacts via its ERM binding domain with ezrin, which is known to act as a PKA anchoring protein and to associate with the actin cytoskeleton (19Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). This interaction between NHERF, ezrin, and PKA is hypothesized to be essential not only to regulate CFTR activity but also to anchor CFTR to the cytoskeleton (18Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D.

To learn more about the role of NHERF in regulating CFTR in polarized airway cells, we monitored the activity and trafficking of CFTR in two human bronchial cell lines: 16HBE14o- cells derived from a normal subject and expressing wild-type CFTR and CFBE41o- cells derived from CF individuals homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation of CFTR. The 16HBE14o- cell monolayers provide a well polarized airway epithelial cell culture system exhibiting vectorial ion transport (23Cozens A.L. Yezzi M.J. Kunzelmann K. Ohrui T. Chin L. Eng K. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Gruenert D.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) and express NHERF1 primarily on the apical membrane where it functions as a scaffolding protein organizing apical membrane proteins into regulatory complexes (24Mohler P.J. Kreda S.M. Boucher R.C. Sudol M. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We report here that both normal and CF cells express both NHERF1 and NHERF2, but it is NHERF1 that follows CFTR expression patterns. Both of the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains and the ERM domain of NHERF1 are involved in the polarized expression of CFTR and in the regulation of CFTR-dependent chloride efflux. Further, targeted NHERF1 overexpression stimulates CFTR-dependent chloride efflux by increasing apical CFTR expression in normal 16HBE14o- cells. Importantly, in the CF cell lines, CFBE41o- and CFT1-C2, targeted NHERF1 overexpression induced the redistribution of CFTR from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and rescues CFTR activity. Cell Culture—Experiments were performed with a series of human tracheobronchial epithelial cell lines: the normal, 16HBE14o-, and the CF homozygous for the ΔF508 allele (ΔF508/ΔF508), CFBE41o-, comprised the generous gift of Prof. D. Gruenert (California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, University of California at San Francisco), whereas the CF cell line, CFT1-C2, isolated from a ΔF508 CF patient, was the generous gift of Prof. J. R. Yankaskas (Cystic Fibrosis/Pulmonary Research and Treatment Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC). 16HBE14o- and CFBE41o- were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. CFT1-C2 cells were cultured with serum-free Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin, 3.7 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 25 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 30 nm triiodothyronine, 1 μm hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 10 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma) (25Yankaskas J.R. Haizlip J.E. Conrad M. Koval D. Lazarowski E. Paradiso A.M. Rinehart Jr., C.A. Sarkadi B. Schlegel R. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1219-C1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cell lines were routinely grown on tissue culture plastic flasks coated with an extracellular matrix containing fibronectin/vitrogen/bovine serum albumin (26Bagorda A. Guerra L. Di Sole F. Hemle-Kolb C. Cardone R.A. Fanelli T. Reshkin S.J. Gisler S.M. Murer H. Casavola V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For experiments of chloride efflux, confocal immunofluorescence analysis, Western blot analysis and biotinylation, cells were seeded on 0.4-μm pore size PET filter inserts (Falcon BD Biosciences Labware) coated with the same extracellular matrix. Transfection of NHERF1 and NHERF2 cDNAs—At 70-80% confluence, cells were transiently transfected with wild-type mouse NHERF1 cDNA or cDNAs mutated in the different domains and inserted into the pcDNA3.1/Hygro+ vector. HRF1A and HRF2A are cDNAs encoding NHERF1 in which alanine substitutions GAGA in the core peptide-binding sequence, GYGF, in PDZ1 (HRF1A) and PDZ2 (HRF2A) domain inactivate the individual PDZ domain; ΔERM is a cDNA encoding NHERF1 truncated of the last 30 amino acids. All of these clones behave as dominant mutants over the endogenous protein. Another plasmid construct used was human, wild-type NHERF2 inserted into the pcDNA3.1/His-C (gift of Dr. Pann Ghill Suh). The cells were transiently transfected using Escort IV reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the experiments were conducted 48 h later. Fluorescence Measurements of Apical Chloride Efflux—Chloride efflux was measured using the Cl--sensitive dye MQAE (26Bagorda A. Guerra L. Di Sole F. Hemle-Kolb C. Cardone R.A. Fanelli T. Reshkin S.J. Gisler S.M. Murer H. Casavola V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Confluent cell monolayers grown on permeable filters were loaded overnight in culture medium containing 5 mm MQAE at 37°C in a CO2 incubator and then inserted into a perfusion chamber that allowed independent perfusion of apical and basolateral cell surfaces. Fluorescence was recorded with a Cary Eclipse Varian spectrofluorometer using 360 nm (bandwidth 10 nm) as excitation wavelength and 450 nm (bandwidth 10 nm) as emission wavelength. To measure chloride efflux rate across the apical membrane, the apical perfusion medium was changed to a medium in which chloride was substituted with iso-osmotic nitrate. All experiments were performed at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered bicarbonate-free media (Cl- medium (in millimolar): NaCl 135, KCl 3, CaCl2 1.8, MgSO4 0.8, HEPES 20, KH2PO4 1, glucose 11, and Cl- free-medium: NaNO3 135, KNO3 3, MgSO4 0.8, KH2PO4 1, HEPES 20, Ca(NO3)2 5, glucose 11). At the end of each experiment a calibration procedure was performed as previously described (26Bagorda A. Guerra L. Di Sole F. Hemle-Kolb C. Cardone R.A. Fanelli T. Reshkin S.J. Gisler S.M. Murer H. Casavola V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The rates of chloride efflux were calculated by linear regression analysis of the first 30 points taken at 4 s intervals while the change of fluorescence was still linear. In all reported experiments, the basolateral side of the monolayer was treated with bumetanide (5 μm) for 5 min before stimulation to avoid the possibility that the observed increase of chloride efflux could be due to the stimulation of basolateral Na+/K+/2Cl-. Detection of CFTR-dependent Chloride Efflux—16HBE14o-polarized monolayers exhibited a basal chloride efflux under baseline conditions when chloride was replaced by apical nitrate (0.030 ± 0.003 Δ(F/F0)/min, n = 15). Stimulation of PKA by addition of FSK plus IBMX (first traces of the typical experiments in supplemental Fig. 1S) significantly increased this apical chloride efflux (0.052 ± 0.005 Δ(F/F0)/min, n = 15, p < 0.0001). It is important to note that this PKA-dependent increase was specific for apical chloride efflux, because the chloride efflux induced by basolateral nitrate perfusion was not altered by FSK plus IBMX (0.032 ± 0.02 versus 0.031 ± 0.004 Δ(F/F0)/min before and after FSK plus IBMX treatment, respectively, n = 4, n.s.). The typical traces in supplemental Fig. 1S, show that addition of the CFTR inhibitors, glibenclamide (Fig. 1S, A, 100 μm) (27Schultz B.D. Singh A.K. Devor D.C. Bridges R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S109-S144Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) or the highly specific CFTRinh-172 (Fig. 1S, C, 5 μm) (28Ma T. Thiagarajah J.R. Yang H. Sonawane N.D. Folli C. Galietta L.J.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 558: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) to the apical perfusion fluids, before (5 min) and during the next FSK plus IBMX stimulation, inhibited this PKA-dependent increase to basal levels. Fig. 1S (B and D) shows the summary of these experiments and, in the histogram, the empty bar represents CFTR-dependent chloride efflux calculated as the difference in alterations of FSK plus IBMX stimulated fluorescence in the absence (light gray bar) and presence (dark bar) of the above mentioned CFTR inhibitors. Because the CFTR-dependent Cl- effluxes calculated with the two inhibitors (empty bars) were not significantly different from each other (0.024 ± 0.002, n = 15, versus 0.026 ± 0.007, n = 6, Δ(F/F0)/min with glibenclamide and CFTRinh-172, respectively, n.s.), we used glibenclamide in all the rest of the experiments and define CFTR-dependent chloride efflux as the difference between the rate of FSK plus IBMX-stimulated chloride efflux before and after apical glibenclamide treatment (presented as the empty bar in all subsequent figures). Moreover, we chose to restrict the apical Cl- efflux measurements in 16HBE14o- cells to 14 days post-seeding of the cells on permeable filters, because both the transepithelial resistance measured as previously reported (26Bagorda A. Guerra L. Di Sole F. Hemle-Kolb C. Cardone R.A. Fanelli T. Reshkin S.J. Gisler S.M. Murer H. Casavola V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21480-21488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the CFTR-dependent chloride effluxes were higher on the 14th day than that measured at the 9th or 6th day post-seeding (400 ± 44, n = 15; 250 ± 32, n = 4; 200 ± 35, n = 4; Ω xcm2, on the 14th, 9th, or 6th days, respectively, and 0.024 ± 0.002 (n = 15), 0.015 ± 0.003 (n = 4), and 0.007 ± 0.001 (n = 4) Δ(F/F0)/min, on the 14th, 9th, or 6th days, respectively). For this reason the confocal analysis, biotinylation, and Western blotting experiments were also performed on the same day. Protein Extraction and Western Blotting—Confluent 16HBE14o- and CFBE41o- monolayers grown on coated permeable filters, were washed with PBS, lysed in lysis buffer A (NaCl 110 mm, Tris 50 mm, Triton X-100 0.5%, and Igepal CA-630 0.5%, pH 8, with added protease inhibitor mixture), sonicated for 10 s, and centrifuged for 10 min (16,000 × g), and then the pellet was discarded. Supernatant protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), and an aliquot of 30 μg of protein was diluted in Laemmli buffer, heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and separated by 4-12% SDS-PAGE Criterion XT precast gel (Bio-Rad). The separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore) in a Trans-Blot semidry electrophoretic transfer cell (Amersham Biosciences) for immunoblotting. The primary antibodies used were anti-hCFTR monoclonal antibody against the C terminus (R&D Systems, MAB25031, dilution 1:500), anti-hNHERF1 monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, dilution 1:500), and anti-hNHERF2 polyclonal antibody (Alpha Diagnostic International, dilution 1:1000). The secondary antibodies were anti-mouse IgG for monoclonal antibodies and anti-rabbit IgG for polyclonal antibody (Sigma). Immunocomplexes were detected with ECL plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and densitometric quantification and image processing were carried out using Adobe Photoshop and the Image software package (version 1.61, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cell Fractionation—Fractionation was performed as described by Sun et al. (31Sun F. Hug M.J. Lewarchik C.M. Yun C.H. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29539-29546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Confluent 16HBE14o- and CFBE41o- cells, cultured on coated permeable filters, were scraped into lysis buffer B (Tris-HCl, 10 mm (pH 7.4), NaCl, 50 mm, EDTA, 1 mm, with protease inhibitor mixture), homogenized in a 5-ml syringe with a 0.8 × 40-mm needle, and an aliquot of total homogenate was collected. Postnuclear supernatants were obtained by centrifugation (900 × g for 15 min) at 4 °C. Another centrifugation (20,000 × g for 20 min) was performed, the pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to obtain cytosolic and membrane fractions. Cytosolic proteins were prepared by concentrating the supernatants through Centricon Centrifugal Filter Devices YM-10, Mr 10,000 cut-off (Millipore), whereas the membrane fraction was obtained by resuspending the pellet in resuspension buffer (HEPES, 50 mm (pH 7.4), NaCl, 150 mm, EDTA, 1 mm, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). 30 μg of protein from total lysate, membrane, and cytosolic fractions were diluted in Laemmli buffer and resolved by 4-12% SDS-PAGE Criterion XT precast gel (Bio-Rad). Biotinylation of Apical Membrane Proteins—16HBE14o- and CFBE41o- cells, grown on coated permeable filters, were transfected with the vector containing wt NHERF1, PDZ domain-mutated or ERM domain-deleted NHERF1 cDNA constructs, or the empty vector. 48 h later the monolayers were washed with PBS and incubated with 2 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. All further steps were performed in a cold room. Free sulfo-NHS-biotin was removed by washing cells twice at 4 °C with 0.1 m glycine in PBS and then with PBS. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer A, sonicated, and centrifuged, and the pellet was discarded. Volumes of supernatant, containing equal amounts of protein, were incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing with the same amount of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) (50 μl of streptavidin/mg of biotin). Streptavidin-bound complexes were pelleted (16,000 × g), and after two washes with buffer lysis, biotinylated proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Immunofluorescence Analysis—105 cells were seeded on round coated glass coverslips and 48 h later washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After three more washes in PBS, the cells were blocked in 0.1% gelatin in PBS for 10 min and then incubated in a wet environment with primary antibodies for 1 h; anti-hNHERF1 (dilution 1:50) and anti-hNHERF2 (dilution 1:50). After washing three times with 0.1% gelatin in PBS, the cells were incubated in a wet environment with secondary antibodies for 1 h: goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, dilution 1:1000) or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes, dilution 1:1000). After three washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted onto slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence data were collected with a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-S with a 40× oil immersion objective and processed by using the Metamorph Imaging System (Meta Imaging 9.1). Deconvolution was performed using Auto Deblur software (AutoQuant Imaging Suite 9.1). Collected images were exported to Adobe Photoshop for subsequent analyses. Confocal Imaging—For confocal immunofluorescence analysis, cells grown on coated permeable filters were prepared as described above and examined using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with a laser scanning confocal unit model MRC-1024 containing a 15-milliwatt krypton-argon laser (Bio-Rad). Monolayer confluence was detected by staining monolayers for the tight junction protein, ZO-1 (mouse anti-ZO-1-(Alexa Fluor 488) Zymed Laboratories, dilution 1:50). Specimens were viewed through a Planapo 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective, and images were randomly acquired in the vertical plane (xz) by the Laser Sharp 2000 program (Bio-Rad). The relative distribution of CFTR (Alexa Fluor 568) and NHERF1 (Alexa Fluor 488) was determined in the apical region and in the cytoplasm by semiquantitative analysis of previously acquired images using ImageJ software: a freehand selection (∼8 μm2) was drawn over the region to be measured, and pixel counts within the selected region were determined. The transition between apical and basolateral regions was identified by staining lateral membranes of the monolayers for the tight junction protein ZO-1. The distribution of CFTR and NHERF1 was calculated using the formula, r = a/c, where a corresponds to pixel counts in the apical region and c corresponds to pixel counts in the cytoplasmic region. Data Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. for the number of samples indicated (n). Statistical comparisons were made using either unpaired or paired data Student's t test. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Expression and Distribution of NHERF1 and NHERF2 in 16HBE14o- and CFBE41o- Cells—Studies have provided evidence that CFTR interacting proteins play critical roles in determining its proper expression and function, and NHERF was the first identified CFTR-binding protein (32Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To further clarify the mechanism by which the interaction of NHERF with CFTR regulates CFTR expression and activity in human airway epithelial cells, we first analyzed the expression levels and cellular distribution of both NHERF isoforms in the normal human bronchial epithelial cell line, 16HBE14o- and in the ΔF508 homozygous (ΔF508/ΔF508) CFBE41o- cell line. Western blot analysis performed in the airway cells seeded on coated permeable filters revealed that both the NHERF1 and NHERF2 isoforms were expressed in both cell lines (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we next examined the cellular distribution of NHERF1 and NHERF2 between the surface and the inside of the cell by indirect immunofluorescence staining with mouse anti-NHERF1 and rabbit anti-NHERF2. Interestingly, both cell lines revealed an intracellular distribution for NHERF2 (Fig. 1B), whereas NHERF1 was localized at the cell surface in 16HBE14o- cells and was mainly cytoplasmic in CFBE41o- cells (Fig. 1B). This finding that only NHERF1 distribution is different between 16HBE14o- and CFBE41o- cells directed us to focus on a more complete analysis of the localization of NHERF1 and CFTR in polarized cultures of the two cell lines. CFTR and NHERF1 Expression and Localization in 16HBE14o- and CFBE41o- Cell Monolayers—We first determined the relative amount of mature (180 kDa) and immature (160 kDa) CFTR in lysate, cytosol, and total membrane fractions of cell monolayers grown on permeable coated filters"
https://openalex.org/W2144131965,"Barrier to autointegration factor (BAF) is an essential conserved double-stranded DNA-binding protein in metazoans. BAF binds directly to LEM domain nuclear proteins (e.g. LAP2, Emerin, and MAN1), lamin A, homeodomain transcription factors, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1-encoded proteins. BAF influences higher order chromatin structure and is required to assemble nuclei. BAF also facilitates retroviral preintegration complex insertion into target DNA in vitro, through unknown mechanisms. We report that BAF binds directly and selectively to linker histone H1.1 (among three subtypes tested) and core histone H3 with affinities of approximately 700 nm and approximately 100-200 nm, respectively, in vitro and in vivo. Mutations at the bottom and top surfaces of the BAF dimer disrupted or enhanced, respectively, this binding and affected H1 and H3 similarly. Biochemical studies showed that C-terminal residues 108-215 of histone H1.1 and the N-terminal tail plus helix alphaN in the core of histone H3.1 were each necessary and sufficient to bind BAF. Based on its interactions with histones and DNA, we propose BAF might bind nucleosomes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2057940509,"The nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor (RXR) can regulate transcription through homotetramers, homodimers, and heterodimers with other nuclear receptors such as the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The mechanisms that underlie the nuclear import of RXR, VDR, and RXR-VDR heterodimers were investigated. We show that RXR and VDR translocate into the nucleus by distinct pathways. RXR strongly bound to importinβ and was predominantly nuclear in the absence of ligand. Importin binding and nuclear localization of RXR were modestly enhanced by its ligand, 9-cis-retinoic acid. On the other hand, VDR selectively associated with importinα. Importin association and correspondingly nuclear import of VDR were markedly augmented by 1,25(OH)2D3. RXR-VDR dimerization inhibited the ability of RXR to bind importinβ and to mobilize into the nucleus using its own nuclear localization signal. In contrast, VDR recruited RXR-VDR heterodimers to importinα and mediated nuclear import of the heterodimers in response to 1,25(OH)2D3. Hence nuclear import of RXR-VDR heterodimers is mediated preferentially by VDR and is controlled by the VDR ligand. The observations reveal a novel mechanism by which an RXR heterodimerization partner dominates the activity of the heterodimers.

Like other nuclear receptors, RXR is comprised of several distinct functional domains: an amino-terminal domain, involved in ligand-independent basal transcriptional activity; a DNA-binding domain (DBD) containing two “zinc finger” motifs; a flexible hinge region; and a carboxyl-terminal region, termed the ligand-binding domain (LBD). The LBD contains the ligand-binding pocket as well as regions that mediate multiple protein-protein interactions including association with transcriptional co-regulators, formation of dimers, and, in the case of RXR, formation of tetramers. The LBD of nuclear receptors, including RXR, thus coordinates their ligand-dependent transcriptional activities (1Laudet V. Gronemeyer H. The Nuclear Receptor Facts Book. Academic Press, London2002Google Scholar).In the absence of its cognate ligand, RXR forms high affinity homotetramers. These tetramers are transcriptionally silent, but they rapidly dissociate upon ligand binding (2Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Kersten S. Reczek P.R. Noy N. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 284: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hence RXR tetramers appear to serve as an inactive storage pool from which active species can be liberated in response to 9cRA. An additional role for the RXR tetramers was recently suggested by the observations that these oligomers act as DNA architectural factors. It was thus demonstrated that binding of RXR tetramers to promoter regions that contain two RXR response elements in tandem results in a dramatic DNA looping, thereby enabling transcriptional regulation by factors placed far upstream from start sites of target genes (5Yasmin R. Yeung K.T. Chung R.H. Gaczynska M.E. Osmulski P.A. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hence by modulating DNA geometry, RXR tetramers can regulate gene expression in a manner that is responsive to 9cRA but is independent of the intrinsic transcriptional activity of the receptor (5Yasmin R. Yeung K.T. Chung R.H. Gaczynska M.E. Osmulski P.A. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although RXR can activate transcription as a homodimer (6Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 7Brelivet Y. Kammerer S. Rochel N. Poch O. Moras D. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), this receptor also serves as an obligatory common dimerization partner for numerous other class II nuclear receptors such as the retinoic acid receptor, the thyroid hormone receptor, and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (1Laudet V. Gronemeyer H. The Nuclear Receptor Facts Book. Academic Press, London2002Google Scholar). Through heterodimerization with these receptors RXR functions as a “master regulator” of multiple signaling pathways that are regulated by various hormones and converge at the genome.Available information suggests that the partitioning of RXR between its different oligomeric complexes is regulated by cognate ligands for this receptor and for its heterodimerization partners. Hence apoRXR is predominantly tetrameric, and ligand binding by this receptor yields RXR homodimers (2Kersten S. Kelleher D. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8645-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Kersten S. Dong D. Lee W. Reczek P.R. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Kersten S. Pan L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13717-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It was also reported that the RXR ligand 9cRA stabilizes RXR homodimers and inhibits the association of RXR with heterodimerization partners such as retinoic acid receptor and VDR (6Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 9Dong D. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10691-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Ligand binding by either retinoic acid receptor or VDR was found to overcome this inhibition and to stabilize the respective heterodimers even in the presence of 9cRA. Heterodimerization is thus maximal in the presence of both 9cRA, acting to dissociate RXR tetramers, and the ligand for the partner, which stabilizes the heterodimer (9Dong D. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10691-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 10Thompson P.D. Jurutka P.W. Haussler C.A. Whitfield G.K. Haussler M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8483-8491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whether enhancement of heterodimerization by the ligand for the partner is a general feature of RXR heterodimers remains to be clarified. As the various RXR-containing oligomers function in the nucleus, an important question for understanding how their activities are regulated relates to the mechanisms that underlie their nuclear import.Nuclear import of proteins is often mediated by a cluster of basic amino acids in their primary sequence such as the “classical” nuclear localization signals (NLSs) comprised of the sequence K(K/R)X(K/R) (11Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 12Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). These sequences are recognized by adapter proteins known as α importins. Importinαs contain two distinct NLS binding sites that can each bind a single NLS, or they can associate with a stretch containing a bipartite signal (15Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 16Fontes M.R. Teh T. Jans D. Brinkworth R.I. Kobe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27981-27987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cargo-loaded importinα binds to one of the various forms of importinβ, which in turn mediates the nuclear import of the complex (12Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). It was also reported that some cargoes can interact directly with importinβ. The sequences recognized by importinβ are less well understood and may vary, but in some cases, they are reminiscent of classical NLSs in that they are comprised of regions rich in basic residues (17Moore J.D. Yang J. Truant R. Kornbluth S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 18Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell.

Several nuclear receptors, including various steroid receptors, RXR, VDR, and thyroid hormone receptor, were found to contain an NLS, termed NL1, between the two zinc fingers of their DBD (20Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Hache R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 21Hsieh J.C. Shimizu Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Haussler C.A. Jurutka P.W. Haussler M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 94-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, some receptors appear to contain more than one NLS. It was thus reported that the glucocorticoid receptor harbors an additional NLS within its LBD, and that this sequence possesses a different importin selectivity than that displayed by the NL1 (22Freedman N.D. Yamamoto K.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2276-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). VDR appears to harbor a bipartite NLS in the stretch between residues 67 and 108 (21Hsieh J.C. Shimizu Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Haussler C.A. Jurutka P.W. Haussler M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 94-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and another NLS in its hinge region (23Michigami T. Suga A. Yamazaki M. Shimizu C. Cai G. Okada S. Ozono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33531-33538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The importin selectivity of different receptors and the factors that regulate their nuclear import are incompletely understood. It was reported that some receptors, including RXR and retinoic acid receptor, are constitutively nuclear (24Dong S. Stenoien D.L. Qiu J. Mancini M.A. Tweardy D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4465-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Maruvada P. Baumann C.T. Hager G.L. Yen P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12425-12432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). On the other hand, nuclear translocation of other receptors appears to be a regulated event. For example, nuclear retention of thyroid hormone receptor α1 was found to be regulated by phosphorylation of one or more residues (26Nicoll J.B. Gwinn B.L. Iwig J.S. Garcia P.P. Bunn C.F. Allison L.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 205: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). VDR appears to distribute between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the absence of its ligand and to undergo nuclear translocation upon ligand binding (21Hsieh J.C. Shimizu Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Haussler C.A. Jurutka P.W. Haussler M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 94-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Prufer K. Racz A. Lin G.C. Barsony J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41114-41123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It was also reported that nuclear import of VDR is promoted in the presence of RXR, suggesting that the process involves RXR-VDR heterodimers (27Prufer K. Racz A. Lin G.C. Barsony J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41114-41123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 28Prufer K. Barsony J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1738-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that underlie the nuclear import of RXR-containing heterodimers are unknown.The present work was undertaken to better characterize the involvement of cognate ligands in regulating the nuclear localization of VDR, RXR, and their mutual heterodimer and to obtain insight into the mechanisms by which the nuclear import of these receptors is accomplished.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESVectors—Expression constructs for GFP-RXR and BFP-VDR were generated by PCR using mouse RXRα and human VDR in pSG5 as templates. Resulting PCR products were subcloned into enhanced GFP and enhanced BFP vectors (Clontech), respectively, using the restriction sites 5′-EcoRI and XbaI-3′ for GFP-RXR and 5′-XhoI and BamHI-3′ for BFP-VDR. In both cases, the fluorescent proteins were fused to the amino termini of the receptors. Constructs were verified by sequencing at the Cornell Biotechnology Center. NLS mutants of the receptors were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenesis was carried out in two rounds. A luciferase reporter construct containing the VDR response element of the vitamin D 24-hydroxylase gene was a gift from Hector DeLuca (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) (29Arbour N.C. Ross T.K.

Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6783-6792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were gifs from Alec Hodel (Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA) and from Stephen Adam (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL), respectively.Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For experimentation, cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% charcoal-treated serum and transfected using FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science). For microscopy, cells were plated in coverglass bottom dishes (Matek Corp.) and transfected with vectors encoding constructs of GFP-RXR (0.25 μg) or BFP-VDR (1.00 μg). Following a 24-h incubation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, cells were treated with vehicle or ligand for 30 min prior to imaging; this was carried out in Tyrode's buffer (0.135 m NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 5 mm glucose.Transactivation Assays—Cells were cultured in 6-well plates and transfected with GFP-RXR (50 ng), BFP-VDR (100 ng), or both along with a luciferase reporter construct driven by a VDR response element and pCH110 serving as a transfection efficiency control. 24 h following transfection, cells were treated with appropriate ligands for 24 h. Cells were then lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity.Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were transfected with an expression vector for RXR (3 μg/100-mm plate), maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h, and treated with vehicle or 9cRA (1 μm) for 1 h prior to lysis using a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm KCl, 0.137 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 μm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Plates were incubated while rocking (at 4 °C for 20 min), and cells were scraped, transferred, and centrifuged at 1000 rpm to separate cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) from nuclei (pellet). Pellets were washed three times, and nuclei were lysed in 200 μl of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 400 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Following a 15-min incubation at 4 °C, mixtures were centrifuged, and supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and an equal amount of proteins was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blots.Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Co-precipitation Assays—Importinα1ΔIBB and importinβ were bacterially expressed in fusion with GST. Bacteria were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysozyme (6 mg/ml) was added, and cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, sonicated, and centrifuged. Supernatants were incubated with GST-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. Beads were washed three times and resuspended in buffer A. Concentrations of immobilized proteins were estimated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Receptors used in co-precipitation assays were obtained by ectopic expression in COS-7 cells. Cells were transfected with expression vectors for RXR, for BFP-VDR, or for both. Cells were lysed by a freeze-thaw cycle using buffer A containing aprotinin and leupeptin, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Cell lysate was incubated with beads containing 30 μg of the appropriate GST-importin in the presence or absence of ligands. Reaction mixtures were incubated (at 4 °C for 3 h), and beads washed three times in buffer A, resuspended in SDS loading buffer, and boiled. Proteins that co-precipitated with importin were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blots using GFP antibodies (Clontech) or antibodies for RXR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Multiphoton Microscopy—Multiphoton microscopy was performed using an apparatus similar to that described previously (31Williams R.M. Webb W.W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3839-3850PubMed Google Scholar). Multiphoton excitation was generated using a Spectra Physics Ti:Sapphire laser (Millenium-Tsunami combination) providing ∼100-fs pulses with an 80-MHz repetition rate at 730-nm wavelengths for BFP and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging and 850 nm for GFP imaging. Beam scanning and image acquisition were performed with a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 scanning system interfaced with an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope. A Conoptics (Danby, CT) 350-80 BKLA Pockel's Cell provided beam intensity modulation and blanking during scanner flyback when data were not being collected. The beam was focused, and the resulting fluorescence was collected with an Olympus 40×/1.3 numerical aperture oil UPlanFl objective. The specimen fluorescence was spectrally selected from the excitation beam (before descanning) using a 670-nm long pass dichroic filter (670DCXXRU, Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT) and then further separated into either blue or green detection channels using a 490DCXR dichroic and BGG22 and hq575/150 filters (Chroma). Subsequently the fluorescence was detected using two bialkali photomultiplier tube (PMT) assemblies (Hamamatsu, HC125-02), and the resulting signal was transmitted to the standard MRC-1024 integrators by intercepting the photomultiplier inputs on the power cable. Imaging data consisted of at least three imaging sessions with ∼30 cells analyzed for each condition.Image Analysis—To examine individual cell statistics with a statistically significant sampling size, nuclei were automatically selected and analyzed (IDL, Research Systems Inc.) by adopting an object recognition protocol in which the image to be analyzed was thresholded by an amount given by the average background fluorescence (b) plus two standard deviations (σ) of this background value (b + 2σ). Contiguous regions smaller than 5 um2 were assumed to be noise and ignored. From each region average blue and green values were compiled and corrected for the image background (the median pixel value in each image). A similar protocol could not be used for obtaining cytoplasmic statistics because of the abundance of mitochondria-derived cell autofluorescence (presumably due to NADH). Cytoplasmic-to-nuclear fluorescence ratios were determined manually using the histogram function in Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA). Regions of interest that contained no mitochondrial autofluorescence were selected (by eye). Average blue or green channel values were corrected by background measurements in cells that were not transfected.RESULTSGeneration of GFP-RXR and BFP-VDR—To enable imaging of RXR and VDR in live cells, mammalian expression constructs for GFP-RXR and for BFP-VDR were generated. To examine the functionality of these proteins, COS-7 cells were transfected with an empty vector or co-transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-RXR and BFP-VDR. Transcriptional activities were examined by transactivation assays using a luciferase reporter driven by a VDR response element. Minimal responses were observed upon transfection of an empty vector, reflecting the low concentration of VDR in these cells (Fig. 1A). Upon transfection of the labeled receptors, the expression of the reporter was markedly up-regulated following treatment with either D3 or the RXR ligand 9cRA. Concomitant treatment with both ligands resulted in synergistic reporter activation. These observations verify that the tagged receptors are fully functional in their ability to form heterodimers, bind DNA, and activate transcription in response to their cognate ligands.VDR Associates with Importinα, whereas RXR Binds to Importinβ—Nuclear import of proteins is often accomplished by adapter proteins known as α importins, which in turn associate with an importinβ to mediate nuclear localization (12Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). It was also reported that some cargoes interact directly with importinβ and that, in some cases, NLSs that are recognized by importinβ are similar to classical NLSs in that they are comprised of a cluster of basic residues. To examine the mechanisms that underlie the nuclear import of VDR and RXR, their association with importinα1 and importinβ and the effect of cognate ligands on these interactions were investigated. As the molecular weights of the two receptors are similar, we used BFP-VDR and untagged RXR to allow for resolution of the receptors by SDS-PAGE. COS-7 cells were transfected with either expression vectors and lysed 24 h after transfection to obtain lysates that contained the respective receptors. In these experiments, importinα1 lacking its autoinhibitory importinβ-binding domain (importinαΔIBB) was used. The IBB serves to associate importinα with importinβ; this association in turn mediates the nuclear import of the importinα-cargo complex (32Harreman M.T. Cohen P.E. Hodel M.R. Truscott G.J. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21361-21369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the absence of importinβ, the domain internally folds to cover the cargo-binding region of importinα and thus inhibits the association of the protein with its cargo. Hence in the absence of importinβ, cargo binding by importinα is quite weak. Note as well that the IBB is important for the ability of importinα to release its cargo once in the nucleus but is not involved in cargo binding in the cytoplasm (33Harreman M.T. Hodel M.R. Fanara P. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5854-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hence to bypass the need to include importinβ in pull-down assays aimed at examining the interactions VDR and RXR with of importinα, a truncated protein lacking the autoinhibitory domain was used. ImportinαΔIBB and importinβ were bacterially expressed as GST fusion proteins and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and their interactions with RXR and BFP-VDR were investigated by co-precipitation assays. Lysates were mixed with immobilized importin, beads were centrifuged and washed, and proteins that precipitated with the importin were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blots. As a control, nonspecific association of receptors with immobilized GST alone was examined. In all experiments, neither RXR nor VDR associated with GST alone (e.g. Fig. 1, B and D, and see also Fig. 5C). RXR did not bind to importinαΔIBB (Fig. 1B). In contrast, VDR weakly associated with importinαΔIBB in the absence of ligand, and the interaction was markedly stabilized in the presence of D3 (Fig. 1C). Although RXR did not associate with importinα, this receptor displayed a robust interaction with importinβ. The association was readily apparent in the absence of ligand and was further enhanced in the presence of 9cRA (Fig. 1D). VDR displayed a weak and ligand-independent interaction with importinβ (Fig. 1E). These observations reveal that, despite the similarities of their NLSs, RXR and VDR are recognized by different importins.FIGURE 5VDR recruits the RXR-VDR heterodimer to importinα, whereas RXR does not mediate heterodimer association with importinβ. Importinα1ΔIBB and importinβ were bacterially expressed as GST fusion proteins and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. BFP-VDR and RXR or BFP-VDR and RXRnlsm were co-expressed in COS-7 cells. Co-precipitation assays were carried out to examine the interactions of BFP-VDR and RXR (A) or the interactions of BFP-VDR and RXRnlsm (B) with importinα1ΔIBB (impα) in the absence or presence of ligands. The interactions of RXR and BFP-VDR with importinβ (impβ, C) were similarly examined. Proteins that precipitated with the respective importins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Western blots. Membranes were probed using VDR antibodies and then reprobed for RXR. In all experiments, uniform loading of bait was verified by Ponceau S staining of the membranes. Experiments were carried out three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)9cRA Enhances the Nuclear Translocation of RXR—To examine the subcellular distribution of RXR, COS-7 cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding GFP-RXR. Cells were grown for 24 h in serum-free medium, treated with vehicle or 9cRA for 30 min, and imaged using multiphoton fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2A). To obtain statistically meaningful data, the intensity of GFP-RXR fluorescence in the nuclei of 30 cells treated in the absence or presence of ligand was quantitated (Fig. 2B). In agreement with the observations that RXR displays a robust association with importinβ in the absence of ligand (Fig. 1D), apoRXR was found to be predominantly nuclear. Consequently fluorescence intensity in the cytoplasm could not be accurately measured on the background of the intense nuclear fluorescence, and data are provided on fluorescence intensity in the nucleus only. Also in agreement with the stabilization of importinβ binding by RXR upon addition of 9cRA, treatment of cells with this ligand resulted in a significant enhancement of nuclear GFP-RXR fluorescence. These observations suggest that, in the absence of ligand, a fraction of RXR is retained in the cytosol, and that this fraction is induced to undergo nuclear translocation upon addition of 9cRA. To further examine the subcellular distribution of RXR, subcellular fractionations were carried out. COS-7 cells expressing endogenous RXR or cells ectopically overexpressing the receptor were treated with vehicle or 9cRA for 1 h. Nuclei were separated from cytosolic fractions, and the RXR content in these fractions was monitored by Western blot analyses. The nuclear and cytosolic markers TBP and β-tubulin, respectively, were used as loading controls and to verify successful separation of the respective fractions (Fig. 2C). The data clearly show that, in the absence of ligand, RXR is prese"

Direct characterization of such transitions is often hindered by the complicated nature of the interaction network among amino acids. A recently engineered small protein-like peptide with a simple amino acid composition features a temperature-driven α-helix to β-sheet conformational change. Here we studied the conformational transition of this peptide by molecular dynamics simulations. We observed a critical temperature, below which the peptide folds into an α-helical coiled-coil state and above which the peptide misfolds into β-rich structures with a high propensity to aggregate. The structures adopted by this peptide during low temperature simulations have a backbone root mean square deviation less than 2 Å from the crystal structure. At high temperatures, this peptide adopts an amyloid-like structure, which is mainly composed of coiled anti-parallel β-sheets with the cross-β-signature of amyloid fibrils. Most strikingly, we observed conformational conversions in which an α-helix is converted into a β-strand by proximate stable β-sheets with exposed hydrophobic surfaces and unsaturated hydrogen bonds. Our study suggested a possible generic molecular mechanism of the template-mediated aggregation process, originally proposed by Prusiner (Prusiner, S. B. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 95, 13363-13383) to account for prion infectivity. Protein conformation diseases, including Alzheimer, Lou Gehrig, and prion diseases (1Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11023) Google Scholar), involve the aggregation of soluble proteins into insoluble amyloid fibrils following major conformational rearrangements. It has been shown that the amyloid fibrils formed by various proteins share a common core structure mainly composed of β-sheets (2Sunde M. Serpell L.C. Bartlam M. Fraser P.E. Pepys M.B. Blake C.C.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Thus, an intriguing conformational transition from α-helices to β-sheets occurs en route to the aggregation of natively α-helical proteins, such as prion proteins (3Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar) in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and the Aβ peptide in Alzheimer disease (4Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular mechanism of such a transition is vital for the development of the final cure of amyloidogenic diseases (1Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11023) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of this type of conformational transition, the detailed molecular mechanism is largely unknown. It has been shown that misfolded prion proteins are infectious even across species barriers (3Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). A template model proposed by Prusiner (3Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar) explains prion infectivity. In this model, misfolded prions induce the conversion of nearby native prions to the misfolded state. However, the exact aggregation pathway and the driving forces have yet to be uncovered. Studies of molecular mechanisms and pathways are often hindered by complex interaction networks among the amino acids and in some cases by the large sizes of proteins related to these diseases. It has been shown that aggregation into amyloid fibrils is a common property of polypeptides (5Guijarro J.I. Sunde M. Jones J.A. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 6Fandrich M. Fletcher M.A. Dobson C.M. Nature. 2001; 410: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Therefore, simple proteins and peptide systems can serve as model systems for deciphering the general mechanism of the α-helix to β-sheet conformational transition (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Characterization of conformational transitions of polypeptides that undergo large secondary-structure rearrangements is experimentally challenging because the time scales of these conformational changes are often experimentally inaccessible. Thus, computational approaches are necessary to provide additional insights into the conformational dynamics underlying the drastic conformational changes that occur during protein aggregation (8Peng Y.

The authors (8Peng Y. Hansmann U.H.E. Phys. Rev. E. Stat. Nonlin. Soft. Matter Phys. 2003; 68: 041911-041917Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) also observed a template-mediated β-sheet development, in which a pre-made, frozen β-strand aided the unfolding of an α-helix. To facilitate the conversion, the authors covalently connected the two peptides by a short polyglycine segment. Lipfert et al. (12Lipfert J. Franklin J. Wu F. Doniach S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 648-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) employed a reaction path annealing algorithm to study the misfolding and amyloid formation of a short seven-residue peptide from the yeast prion protein in the presence of pre-made β-sheets. In this algorithm, the initial and final states are fixed, and the energy is computed along the pathway by multiple constrained simulations. Malolepsza et al. (13Malolepsza E. Boniecki M. Kolinski A. Piela L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) observed a prion-like propagation of in silico designed peptide sequences by using a coarse-grained protein model. These hypothetical peptide sequences were designed in silico to feature a metastable β-sheet state in addition to the α-helical ground state. These studies provide computational evidence for the template model of propagating conformational changes proposed by Prusiner (3Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar) that explains the lethal infection of pathological prions. However, to enable the sampling of the vast available conformational spaces, these computational studies either constrain the peptide systems between the folded and misfolded peptides (8Peng Y. Hansmann U.H.E. Phys. Rev. E. Stat. Nonlin. Soft. Matter Phys. 2003; 68: 041911-041917Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Lipfert J. Franklin J. Wu F. Doniach S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 648-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or “freeze” the misfolded template into a pre-assumed β-sheet aggregate (8Peng Y. Hansmann U.H.E. Phys. Rev. E. Stat. Nonlin. Soft.

A. 2005; 102: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) within the close proximity of the folded peptide. Thus, it is possible that these observed conformational inter-conversions are a result of the artificial biases present in the simulations. Hence, an unconstrained study of an experimentally characterized protein system is necessary to understand the α-helix to β-sheet transition and to directly “observe” the template hypothesis proposed by Prusiner (3Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). Recently, Kammerer et al. (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we study the conformational transitions of this de novo peptide in silico. A benefit of using the ccβ peptide as the model system for an aggregation study is the simplicity of the amino acid composition; it lacks aromatic residues, prolines, and cysteines, and its polar residues are either positively charged arginine or negatively charged glutamic acid residues. Significantly, the ccβ peptide is protein-like because it folds into a well defined native structure. We employ discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) 2The abbreviations are: DMDdiscrete molecular dynamicsr.m.s.d.root mean square distance. (14Dokholyan N.V. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Shakhnovich E.I.

Our simulations reproduce the experimentally determined native state trimer of ccβ (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our simulations also capture the experimentally observed dependence of the conformational transition upon temperature. The structure of the aggregates from simulations satisfies the constraints derived from the experimental data, although the detailed atomic structure differs from the model proposed by Kammerer et al. (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Most strikingly, we observe in the course of simulations that several peptides form a β-sheet that acts as a template to convert an α-helix into a β-strand, in the absence of any artificial constraints (8Peng Y. Hansmann U.H.E. Phys. Rev. E. Stat. Nonlin. Soft. Matter Phys. 2003; 68: 041911-041917Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Lipfert J. Franklin J. Wu F. Doniach S. J. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar) of the template-based aggregation scheme for prion proteins. discrete molecular dynamics root mean square distance. Discrete Molecular Dynamics Simulations—We modeled the peptides by a “bead-on-a-string” model with beads representing the backbone and side-chain heavy atoms. Along the backbone, the model contains the nitrogen (N), prime carbon (C′), carbonyl oxygen (O), and α-carbon (C-α). In the side chain, we introduced up to three coarse-grained beads, β, γ, and δ or γ2 beads, depending on the properties of the individual amino acid. The parameters of the protein model and interactions are described in detail elsewhere (18Ding F. Buldyrev S.V. Dokholyan N.V. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 147-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We used the DMD algorithm to perform simulations on our model proteins (14Dokholyan N.V. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Shakhnovich E.I. Folding Des. 1998; 3: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 18Ding F. Buldyrev S.V. Dokholyan N.V. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 147-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). All-Atom Reconstruction—We added the side-chain atoms and backbone H atoms for each amino acid based on the coordinates of the N, C-α, C-β, and C′ atoms. We used a Monte Carlo algorithm to search in the rotamer space (19Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Cohen F.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1661-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) for the optimal arrangement of side chains. The scoring function for rotamer optimization includes van der Waals, solvation, and hydrogen bond interactions. The van der Waals radii and interaction strengths come from the Cedar force field (20Hermans J. Berendsen H.J.C. Vangunsteren W.F. Postma J.P.M. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 1513-1518Crossref Scopus (709) Google Scholar). We applied the solvation model of EEF1 (21Lazaridis T. Karplus M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 35: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), and we used the statistical potential for hydrogen bonds proposed by Kortemme et al. (22Kortemme T. Morozov A.V. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1239-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). All-Atom Molecular Simulations Using Amber—We used Amber (23Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Debolt S.E. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Kollman P.A. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 1-41Crossref Scopus (2671) Google Scholar) to perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We started with coarse-grained structures produced in DMD simulations and then performed all-atom reconstructions. We then solvated our atomically detailed protein within an octagonal box of water molecules cut off 10 Å away from the protein. We used an octagonal box in our simulations to reduce the number of water molecules and to increase the efficiency of computation. To reduce the finite size effect, we utilized periodic boundary conditions. Next, we performed simulations using the SANDER module of Amber7, including the initial energy minimization and equilibration steps that eliminate steric clashes between reconstructed atoms. The actual production simulations began with a free energy minimization of the water molecules, whereas the protein was maintained fixed. Then we minimized the energy of the entire system. Next, we raised the temperature of the system to 300 K. Finally, by using the Berendsen thermostat (see Ref. 24Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. Vangunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23667) Google Scholar) to maintain the temperature of the system and the SHAKE method to monitor protein positions, we performed the actual production simulations. Free Energy Calculation—We calculated the conformational free energies from the all-atom simulation trajectories by using the MM/PBSA (molecular mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann solvent-accessible surface area) module of Amber7 (25Kollman P.A. Massova I. Reyes C. Kuhn B. Huo S.H. Chong L. Lee M. Lee T. Duan Y. Wang W. Donini O. Cieplak P. Srinivasan J. Case D.A. Cheatham T.E. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). We used the last nanosecond of each simulation to compute the conformational free energies. We took a snapshot each picosecond, and we collected 1000 snapshots for each simulation. The conformational free energy is the sum of the average gas phase (vacuum) energy (EGAS), the average solvation energy (GSOL), and the entropy (-TS). EGAS included the electrostatics (EELE), the van der Waals (EVDW), and the bonded energy (EINT). The solvation free energy (GSOL) included the electrostatic contribution GPB, which we calculated with the Poisson-Boltzmann equation using FAMBE (26Vorobjev Y.N. Hermans J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: MP459Google Scholar), and the nonpolar contribution, which is approximated as proportional to the solvent-accessible area (GSUR) (25Kollman P.A. Massova I. Reyes C. Kuhn B. Huo S.H. Chong L. Lee M. Lee T. Duan Y. Wang W. Donini O. Cieplak P. Srinivasan J. Case D.A. Cheatham T.E. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). The estimation of conformational entropy was very challenging (25Kollman P.A. Massova I. Reyes C. Kuhn B. Huo S.H. Chong L. Lee M. Lee T. Duan Y. Wang W. Donini O. Cieplak P. Srinivasan J. Case D.A. Cheatham T.E. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). By using a quasi-harmonic approximation, we estimated the entropy from normal mode analysis with the NMODE module in Amber. We assumed T to be the room temperature 298.15 K. Starting from extended and spatially separated ccβ peptides, we performed equilibrium DMD simulations over a range of temperatures. We first studied the folding and aggregation of three ccβ peptides. We also studied the aggregation process in high temperature simulations of six ccβ peptides. We modeled ccβ peptides by using four types of interactions as follows: hydrophobic (0.84ϵ), salt bridge (1.80ϵ), hydrogen bond among backbones (5.00ϵ), and hydrogen bond between polar side chains and backbones (2.50ϵ). The temperature is in the unit of ϵ/kB, where kB is the Boltzmann constant (14Dokholyan N.V. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Shakhnovich E.I.

Here tu is a reduced time unit that was derived from the units of mass, energy, and length. The length of the DMD simulations was chosen to be long enough so that equilibrium was observed for all studied peptide systems. We assumed that equilibrium was achieved in each simulation when the distribution of potential energies sampled along each trajectory did not change further with the simulation time. Overall, we performed 46 DMD simulations of trimers and 22 DMD simulations of hexamers. Trimer Folds into a Coiled-coil State at Low Temperatures—To quantify the structural transitions that occur in a system of three ccβ peptides, we calculated their propensities to form secondary structure elements, α-helices and β-strands, at different temperatures, using a method proposed by Srinivasan and Rose (27Srinivasan R. Rose G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14258-14263Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Briefly, at each temperature the secondary structure propensities of each residue were calculated and averaged over the corresponding equilibrium trajectory. Then the secondary structure propensities of the peptides were computed as the average over all the residues. We did not include in the plot (Fig. 1) the propensity of forming turns and random coils. We found that at low temperatures these peptides favor α-helical states. The α-helix to β-strand transition occurs at the temperature Tc ≈ 0.71. At high temperatures, T > 0.71, the peptides adopt β-strands, in agreement with the experiments (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). At temperatures T < Tc ≈ 0.71, we observed the formation of the coiled-coil trimers with low potential energies (Fig. 2, A and B). We observed two types of coiled-coil ccβ trimers as follows. (i) Three helices orient in the same direction as determined in the experiment (type I, Fig. 2A). (ii) The orientation of one of the peptides is opposite that of the other two peptides (type II, Fig. 2B). The type I trimer was strikingly similar to the experimental native state structure (Protein Data Bank code 1s9z); the root mean square distance (r.m.s.d.) between a low energy type I and the experimental structure was 1.26 Å (Fig. 2C). Type I and II structures were the result of the orientation permutations of the three peptides in a coiled-coil trimer. Because of the simplifications of the protein structure used in our simulations, these two structures were indistinguishable. The potential energies of the two coiled-coil states were approximately the same in DMD simulations, although in some simulations the potential energy of the type II (non-native) state was even lower than that of the type I (native) state. To determine the thermodynamic viability of the two folded coiled-coil states, we performed free energy calculations on these states using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We first reconstructed the all-atom representation of the two coiled-coil structures from the coarse-grained representation (see “Materials and Methods”). We then performed 2-ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the two typical trimers, obtained in DMD simulations, in the presence of explicit water molecules. The r.m.s.d. between the initial and final ccβ trimer states is smaller than 2 Å, suggesting that there is no significant conformational drift in the process of the 2-ns molecular dynamics simulations. We calculated different terms of the conformational free energy for the two states by using MM/PBSA (molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann solvent-accessible surface area) (TABLE ONE) (see “Materials and Methods”). Because the unfolded states of the two types of trimers are the same, comparing their conformational free energy was equivalent to comparing their stability. We found that the free energy of the native-like state is 21 kcal/mol lower than that of the non-native trimer. Although the free energy difference between these two conformational states was within their standard deviations, the difference between their average values was still statistically significant, with a p value smaller than 10-16 (according to Student's t test). Therefore, the native conformation was indeed more stable than the non-native one.TABLE ONEThe conformational free energy of various structures in the folded and aggregated states The energy terms are in kcal/mol units, and their standard deviations are presented.

We observed the following two types of aggregate structures: (i) β-hairpin aggregates (Fig. 3A), which comprise individual β-hairpin-shaped peptides; and (ii) coiled β-sheets (Fig. 3B), in which peptides collectively form β-sheets that coil around a central region with packed hydrophobic residues inside. The hydrophobic residues in a coiled β-sheet aggregate are clustered inside the core, whereas the polar residues are exposed to solvent (Fig. 3C). The aggregates are stabilized by hydrophobic packing, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges between the oppositely charged residues. As with our low temperature studies, our coarse-grained model cannot distinguish these two types of aggregates. Thus, we performed molecular mechanics free energy calculations to estimate the thermodynamic viability of the two aggregate structures. We reconstructed the all-atom representation of the coarse-grained aggregates from DMD simulations (“Materials and Methods”). Following the same protocol described above, we calculated the conformational free energies of the two aggregates, which are listed in TABLE ONE. Because the reference states were identical, the difference between the conformational free energies ΔΔG discriminates the two putative aggregation states. We found that the conformational free energy of the coiled β-sheet aggregate was ∼55 kcal/mol lower than that of the β-hairpin aggregate. This difference was statistically significant because the standard deviations of the two values do not overlap. Therefore, the coiled β-sheet aggregate was thermodynamically more stable than the β-hairpin aggregate, and we proposed it as the putative building block of the large scale amyloid fibril. This model of the aggregate is in agreement with the experimental observation in that there are no intra-peptide hydrogen bonds (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which exist in the β-hairpin aggregates (Fig. 3A). A Preformed β-Sheet Accelerates the Conversion from α-Helixes to β-Strands—At temperatures T > Tc ≈ 0.71, β-sheets are thermodynamically more stable than α-helices (Fig. 1). Although in the vicinity of the transition temperature, Tc ≈ 0.71, the free energy difference between the two states of a ccβ peptide (a β-sheet and an α-helix) was marginal, there was a large free energy barrier separating these two conformational states (9Ding F. Borreguero J.M. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Dokholyan N.V. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2003; 53: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, the inter-conversion of an isolated α-helix to a stable β-sheet was a rare event, in accord with Ding et al. (9Ding F. Borreguero J.M. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Dokholyan N.V. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2003; 53: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Here we examined the α-helix to β-sheet transition during aggregation near the transition temperature Tc ≈ 0.71. In Fig. 3, D-H, we presented a series of snapshots during a typical transition observed in DMD simulations at T = 0.725. Initially, hydrophobic interactions drove a kinetically trapped α-helix to bind to a pre-formed stable β-sheet; the exposed hydrophobic surface of the β-sheet interacted with the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic helix (Fig. 3D). This interaction was because of an attractive term between hydrophobic residues, which mimics the solvent effect. The α-helix then melts into an unstructured state that was stabilized by forming additional hydrophobic contacts with the external surface of the pre-formed β-sheet partner; this is similar to the hydrophobic solid surface-induced unfolding of α-helices (28Sethuraman A. Belfort G. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1322-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These additional hydrophobic contacts between the peptide and the pre-formed β-sheet greatly reduced the available conformations of the random coil state and, thus, the entropy of the chain. However, the enthalpic gain because of the newly formed hydrophobic interactions overwhelmed the loss of entropy, so that the free energy barrier of the α-helix to β-sheet inter-conversion was reduced. Hence, the “templated” transition time in simulations (Fig. 3, D-F; snapshots taken at 2.29 × 105, 2.62 × 105, and 2.64 × 105 time units, respectively) was on the order of 104 tu, which is smaller than the transition time of 105-106 tu, typical of an isolated peptide (9Ding F. Borreguero J.M. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Dokholyan N.V. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2003; 53: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the increase of the local kinetic energy during the melting process of the α-helix leads to local overheating of the thermal bath, which results in partial melting of the proximal β-strands of the ccβ peptide (Fig. 3, E and F). When the local overheating dissipates due to the thermal bath equilibration, the partially melted β-strands refold (Fig. 3H), resulting in a β-sheet amyloid aggregate precursor. Six Peptides Form a Fibril-like Aggregate—To study further the propagation of the ccβ peptide aggregation, we performed DMD simulations of six peptides at elevated temperatures T > 0.71 (Fig. 4A). Starting from fully extended conformations that are spatially separated, all peptides rapidly equilibrated as did the isolated peptides (Fig. 4A). The equilibration process resulted in a continuous decrease of the potential energy during the first half of 104 tu. Because of the diffusion of the peptides in the simulation box, there was a short plateau of the potential energy in the following 104 tu. The potential energy of the system then sharply decreased as a result of nonspecific association of ccβ peptides driven by the hydrophobic interactions. A slow conformational rearrangement from this initial ccβ peptide assembly leads to an ordered aggregate (Fig. 4B) and is accompanied by a slow decrease of the average potential energy and large potential energy fluctuations. To compare the three peptide and six peptide ccβ simulations, in Fig. 4A we also present a typical simulation trajectory of three ccβ peptides at the same temperature. Although the general trends of potential energy trajectories for these two systems were similar, the potential energy of the final hexamer aggregate was lower than twice the energy of the trimer aggregate. The extra stabilization of the ccβ hexamer with respect to the trimer agreed with the hyperstability of amyloid fibrils. Next we examined the structural properties of the ordered aggregate obtained in DMD simulations. We present a typical aggregate structure that comprises six ccβ peptides in Fig. 4B. The aggregates mainly consisted of anti-parallel β-strands. Because our simplified DMD force field does not distinguish between β-hairpins and coiled-strands, as discussed above, we observed a mixture of these two types of β-structures, similar to the observed trimer aggregates. We found that residues Ala-7 and Leu-14 have a high probability to form hydrogen bonds (Fig. 4B), in accordance with the experiments (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The aggregates have the characteristic cross-β-structure (Fig. 4, C and D); the aggregates were formed by packing β-sheets against each other with hydrogen bonds in the β-sheets aligned along the fibril axis. The distance between the β-strands in the β-sheets was 4.7 Å, which is the typical hydrogen bond distance (Fig. 4D). The distance between packed β-sheets is ∼11 Å (Fig. 4C). We further computed the x-ray diffraction pattern of the aggregate as described by Ding et al. (29Ding F. Dokholyan N.V. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Shakhnovich E.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4E). The x-ray pattern featured the two signature distances of amyloid fibrils, in agreement with the experimental diffraction pattern of the ccβ aggregates (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The only difference between the experimental and simulation x-ray diffraction pattern was the absence of the doublet of 11 Å along the equatorial axis (perpendicular to the fibril axis). In experiments, this doublet peak was interpreted as the distance between more than two sheets packed against each other (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because of the limited number of peptides in our simulations, we did not observe such a large scale aggregate structure. However, we did expect to observe this 22 Å peak in a larger system. The ccβ peptide was designed de novo to fold into a coiled-coil native state at low temperatures and aggregate into amyloid fibrils at elevated temperatures. Experimental studies of ccβ peptides (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) provide important checkpoints for computational modeling of protein dynamics. We employ a recently developed simplified protein model (18Ding F. Buldyrev S.V. Dokholyan N.V. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 147-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) to study the folding and aggregation of ccβ peptides. Because of its coarse-grained nature, our simplified protein model has a degenerate free energy landscape. For example, we observe a non-native coiled-coil state at low temperatures and the coexistence of ccβ-hairpin and coiled β-sheet aggregates at elevated temperatures. By coupling traditional all-atom molecular mechanics simulations with the rapid DMD simulations of simplified protein models, we eliminate free energy landscape degeneracies by screening for the thermodynamically viable states in all-atom molecular mechanics simulations. Such an approach allows the sampling of large protein conformational spaces while maintaining the accuracy of atomic resolution. With our methodology, we successfully reproduce the folding and aggregation dynamics of the ccβ peptides, including the temperature dependence of its folding and aggregation behavior. By using all-atom free energy calculations to filter out the degenerate states from the coarse-grained protein model simulations, we select the coiled-strand β-sheet aggregates as the most probable aggregation states. We postulate that the larger ccβ peptide aggregates are mainly composed of coiled-strand β-structures. The conformational transition from α-helices to β-sheets is an obligatory step toward amyloid fibril formation from natively α-rich proteins, such as prion proteins in prion diseases and Aβ peptides in Alzheimer disease (4Kirkitadze M.D. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 1103-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). The ability of the ccβ peptide to feature both α-helix and β-strand conformations (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) enables us to study such secondary structure transitions. In simulations we observe a temperature-dependent transition from α-helix to β-strand with a midpoint temperature Tc ≈ 0.71. At T ≈ Tc, conformations of α-helices and β-strands have a marginal free energy difference so that an unfolded peptide can adopt either conformation. The secondary structure transition of an isolated α-helix peptide is often difficult to observe (9Ding F. Borreguero J.M. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Dokholyan N.V. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2003; 53: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) because of the large free energy barrier between α-helices and β-sheets. In our simulations, we find that this free energy barrier is reduced by interaction with a preformed β-sheet with an exposed hydrophobic surface and unsaturated hydrogen bonds. Unsaturated hydrogen bonds near the edges of the pre-formed β-sheets greatly stabilize the newly formed β-sheet. Thus, the conformation change of an isolated α-helix peptide into a β-structure appears to be substantially promoted when other β-sheet peptides are introduced into the system (9Ding F. Borreguero J.M. Buldyrev S.V. Stanley H.E. Dokholyan N.V. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2003; 53: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Our simulations provide computational evidence in support of the template-mediated aggregation mechanism of prion proteins proposed by Prusiner (3Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). Our study suggests a generic scenario of the prion-like infectivity of protein misfolding, wherein infected particles expose hydrophobic surfaces and backbone hydrogen bond donors/acceptors that alter the free energy landscape of the normal proteins. This exposure reduces the free energy of both the barrier and the aggregates with respect to the native state. The aggregate structures obtained in our DMD simulations contain the cross-β-patterns observed in amyloid fibrils. In addition, the computed x-ray fibrillar diffraction pattern agrees with the experimental data (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Kammerer et al. (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) proposed a structural model of ccβ peptide amyloid fibril, in which individual ccβ peptides are in an extended β-strand conformation forming anti-parallel β-sheets along the fibril axis. The hydrophobic residues in a β-sheet form two clusters separated by the β-sheet plane (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These β-sheets pack against each other, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and by a set of buried polar residues that form salt bridges. It is questionable whether this model proposed by Kammerer et al. (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) is thermodynamically viable because burying polar residues is energetically unfavorable. In our model, individual peptides form β-strands coiled around their center instead of extended, stacked β-strands. Thus, the hydrophobic residues can cluster together without burying charged residues (Figs. 3C and 4B). Because of the limited number of peptides studied in our simulations, the size of the aggregate model does not reach the dimensions that can be used for comparing with atomic force microscopy measurements (7Kammerer R.A. Kostrewa D. Zurdo J. Detken A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Green J.D. Muller S.A. Meier B.H. Winkler F.K. Dobson C.M. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4435-4440Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We postulate that our prefibrillar aggregates, upon further assembly, would result in the large scale amyloid fibrils observed in experiments."

Laminins are a family of heterotrimeric proteins that are major components of basement membranes, a specialized part of the extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixANFatrionatriuretic factorBNPbrain natriuretic peptideDGCdystrophin glycoprotein complexGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseHifhypoxia-inducible factorRTreverse transcriptionVegfvascular endothelial growth factor%FSpercent fractional shorteningLVMleft ventricular massDGdystroglycanSGsarcoglycanDysdystrophinBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.. Laminins serve as a scaffold for the attachment of other ECM proteins, such as collagens, perlecan, nidogens, and agrin. Additionally, they impact cell differentiation and phenotype maintenance by participating in cell signaling via interactions with integrins and the DGC. Five laminin α chains, three β chains, and three γ chains recombine to form at least 14 distinct laminin isoforms. The five laminin α chains are expressed in a tissue-specific manner with some overlapping patterns (1Aumailley M. Krieg T. J. Invest.

Lama4, the gene encoding the laminin α4 chain, is developmentally regulated during embryogenesis. In adult mice, Lama4 transcripts are most abundant in the heart. By immunostaining, the laminin α4 protein is localized mainly in basement membranes of blood vessel of an adult heart and in the peripheral sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes (8Iivanainen A. Kortesmaa J.

To explore in vivo function of Lama4, the gene was disrupted in mice. Mice null for Lama4 survived embryonic development. About 20% of the homozygous mutants died at the perinatal stage (9Thyboll J.

Heterozygous mutant mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Uppsala, Sweden) for seven generations. Homozygous knock-out mice were obtained through breeding of two heterozygous mice. Immunostaining—Immunofluorecence staining was performed on cryostat sections. To make results comparable, 10-μm-thick cryostat sections from paired mutant and control heart samples were placed on the same slide.

Hif1α monoclonal antibody was from Novus Biologicals; fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibodies were from Dako. Signals were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Leica) and recorded using Spot Advanced (Diagnostics) software. Western Blots Analysis—Total protein extract was prepared with methods described previously (10Wang J. Silva J.P. Gustafsson C.M. Rustin P. Larsson N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4038-4043Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. A protein sample of 50 μg was separated on a 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen), blotted to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). After incubation with primary antibodies, and subsequently horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), signals were developed with luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and exposed to Kodak film. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Northern Blot Analyses—Mouse heart tissue was homogenized in TRIzol solution (Invitrogen), and the RNA was isolated following the manufacturer's instructions. Probes for Northern blot hybridization were purified PCR products amplified with the following primers: atrionatriuretic factor (ANF), 5′-cggtgtccaacacagatctga-3′ (sense) and 5′-gctccaatcctgtcaatccta-3′ (antisense); brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), 5′-caggaatcagctgataaatcaga-3′ (sense) and 5′-cgttacagcccaaacgactga-3′ (antisense); Hsp70, 5′-caaggtggagatcatcgccaa-3′ (sense) and 5′-gaagatgccgtcgtcgatcgt-3′ (antisense).

PCR products were gel-separated and digitally photographed. Northern blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled probes, exposed to a Kodak film, and scanned. The intensities of signals were quantified with image J (NIH) software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download.html) and recorded in pixels. For quantification purpose, relative expression level of a gene was calculated as the ratio of its intensity (in pixels) to the intensity of GAPDH. Sarcolemma Integrity Assay—A sample of 100 μl of 10 mg/ml Evans blue dye (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline was injected intraperitoneally to mutant and control mice of different age groups, as described previously (11Lee G.H. Badorff C. Knowlton K.U. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed 24 h after injection, and hearts were collected and cryosectioned. The presence of Evans blue dye in cardiomyocytes was examined under a fluorescence microscope (Leica). Echocardiography—Echocardiography was performed as described elsewhere (12Tanaka N. Dalton N. Mao L. Rockman H.A. Peterson K.L. Gottshall K.R. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Ross Jr., J. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1109-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with 1% isofluorane, and the following parameters were obtained: heart rate, septal, and posterior wall thickness at end diastole (IVSd and LVPWd), left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVIDd), left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVIDs), septum and posterior wall thickness at end systole (IVSs and LVPWs), percent fractional shortening (%FS), and left ventricular mass (LVM). Single Cardiomyocyte Contractility Measurement—Cardiomyocytes were isolated per the method described previously (13Zhao W. Frank K.F. Chu G. Gerst M.J. Schmidt A.G. Ji Y. Periasamy M. Kranias E.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were excised from heparinized animals and rinsed in ice-cold Tyrode Solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose (pH 7.4). The hearts were canulated and mounted onto the Langendorff perfusion apparatus via the aorta. It was then perfused with Ca2+-free Tyrode at 37 °C for 3 min. Perfusion was then switched to the same solution containing collagenase type II at 1 mg/ml (Invitrogen) and continued until the hearts became flaccid (15–20 min). The heart was then rinsed with Ca2+-free Tyrode for 5 min. Left ventricular tissue was minced and dissociated with pipette. Myocytes solution was filtered through nylon filter and brought up to 1 mm Ca2+ Tyrode in sequential steps. Myocytes were finally resuspended and kept at 1.8 mm Ca2+ Tyrode until experiment. Myocytes with defined edges, no spontaneous contraction, and sarcomere length >1.65 μm were selected for contractility experiment. Sarcomere length was used as an index for contractility as described previously (14Tiemann K. Weyer D. Djoufack P.C. Ghanem A. Lewalter T. Dreiner U. Meyer R. Grohe C. Fink K.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H464-H474PubMed Google Scholar, 15Delbridge L.M. Roos K.P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Contractile properties were assessed using an IonOptix MyoCam® system with the Ion-Wizard SarcLen Data Acquisition software (IonOptix Inc., Milton, MA). Contraction amplitude was measured as the percentage of shortening of sarcomere length. Half-relaxation time was measured as the interval from the peak contraction to 50% relaxation. Statistics—All data were evaluated by the two-tailed Student's t test. Expression Profile of Other Laminin α Chains in Mouse Heart Deficient for the Laminin α4 Chain—We have demonstrated previously the abundance of laminin α4 chain transcripts in the heart. On immunostaining, the protein is localized to the basement membrane of blood vessels and in the peripheral sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes (8Iivanainen A. Kortesmaa J. Sahlberg C. Morita T. Bergmann U. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27862-27868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), indicating a critical role of this protein in cardiovascular development. Surprisingly, most Lama4 null mice survived embryonic and perinatal stages. To explore whether compensation of other laminin α chains occurs in Lama4–/– mice, we examined by immunohistochemistry the expression profile of all five laminin α chains in wild type and Lama4–/– mouse hearts. To ensure a reliable comparison, the thickness of the sections was tightly controlled. Sections from a mutant heart and its littermate control heart were placed on the same slide and stained together. A minimum of four pairs of samples were examined with each antibody. In wild type control hearts, laminin α4 chain was expressed in the basement membrane of blood vessels and in the peripheral sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1a). The expression was abolished in Lama4–/– mutant hearts (Fig. 1b). Laminin α1 or α3 chains were not detectable in either wild type or mutant heart (data not shown). The laminin α2 chain was highly expressed along sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1c). However, no significant difference was observed between wild type and Lama4–/– mutant mouse heart in terms of expression level or distribution pattern (Fig. 1, c and d). In wild type mouse heart, the laminin α5 chain was strongly expressed in large vessels and weakly expressed in capillaries and in the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1e and supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast, the expression of this chain in mutant hearts was highly elevated in the margin of cardiomyocytes and in basement membrane of capillaries (Fig. 1f). Thus, the laminin α5 chain has partially compensated for the loss of the laminin α4 chain in Lama4–/– hearts. Moreover, loss of the laminin α4 chain did not alter total laminin concentration in the heart as the staining intensities of laminin β1 and β2 chains were comparable between mutants and controls (data not shown). Progressive Cardiac Hypertrophy—We have observed that adult Lama4–/– mice had increased frequency of sudden death under noninvasive procedures such as induction of anesthesia. Upon autopsy, enlarged hearts were observed in mice that had sudden death. To determine whether the enlarged heart was a common finding in these mice, we measured body weight and heart weight of Lama4–/– mutant animals and their littermate controls from different age groups, seven to eight mice from each group were used in this study. At 16 weeks of age, both heart weight and body weight were comparable between Lama4–/– mutant and their littermate control mice. Heart weight/body weight ratio was 5.32 ± 0.43 mg/g (mean ± S.E.) in mutant mice, no significant difference compared with that in their littermate controls (4.96 ± 0.58 mg/g, mean ± S.E., p > 0.05). At the age of 40 weeks, there was no significant difference in body weight between mutants and controls (24.55 ± 2.03 g in mutants versus 25.28 ± 2.76 g in littermate controls, mean ± S.E., p > 0.05). In contrast, heart weight was significantly higher in mutant mice. Heart weight/body weight ratio was 6.25 ± 0.22 mg/g in mutant mice, significantly higher than 5.03 ± 0.40 mg/g in their littermate control mice (mean ± S.E., p < 0.001, Fig. 2a). To quantify the size of cardiomyocytes, we measured the cross-section area of the cells. Cryostat sections were stained with antibody against dystrophin to highlight the cell membrane. Sections were subsequently counterstained with Hoechst dye to mark the nuclei. Cross-sections of cardiomyocytes with visible nuclei were marked (Fig. 2b), and the area was measured using image J (NIH) software. Three mutant mice and three age- and sex-matched control mice were used in this study. One-hundred cells from three hearts were measured. There was a significant increase in cardiomyocyte size, as presented by average cross-section area, which was 131.43 ± 3.68 μm2 in mutant heart and 106.95 ± 5.93 μm2 in wild type control heart (mean ± S.E., p < 0.01, Fig. 2c). Progressive Cardiac Dysfunction and Cardiac Arrhythmia—To evaluate cardiac function of mice deficient in the laminin α4 chain, we performed echocardiography on Lama4–/– mutant and control mice of different age groups. At 16–20 weeks of age, echocardiography on four mutant mice and four controls did not reveal any marked abnormalities (data not shown). However, at 36–40 weeks of age, Lama4–/– mutant mice showed significant abnormalities in cardiac function. Fig. 3a is representative echocardiographic images of a Lama4–/– mutant mouse and its littermate control mouse, showing a larger left ventricular end diastolic and end systolic diameters in the mutant mouse compared with the control. The severity of the phenotype varied among individual animals. To gain a statistical evaluation of the phenotype, 12 mutant and 12 age-matched control mice were studied. Fig. 3, b–f, is a cumulative presentation of this study. Overall, heart rate in the Lama4–/– mutant showed no significant difference from control mice (482 ± 27 beats/min in mutant mice versus 564 ± 9 beats/min in control mice, mean ± S.E., p > 0.05, Fig. 3b). There was a significant increase in left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVIDd) in mutants (4.21 ± 0.11 mm) compared with that in controls (3.95 ± 0.08 mm, mean ± S.E., p < 0.05, Fig. 3c) and an increase in left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVIDs, 2.98 ± 0.16 mm in mutants versus 2.51 ± 0.10 mm in controls, mean ± S.E., p < 0.01, Fig. 3d). %FS was reduced in mutant mice, (29.58 ± 2.46) in comparison with 36.6 ± 1.55 in controls (mean ± S.E., p < 0.01, Fig. 3e). Echocardiography also revealed a significantly increase in LVM, which was 101 ± 4.50 mg in mutants compared with 88.3 ± 2.88 mg in controls, mean ± S.E., p < 0.05, Fig. 3f. During echocardiography 6 out of 12 mutant mice had intermittent occurrence of bradycardia and sinus arrhythmia (data not shown), while none of the 12 controls had such abnormalities. Retention of Integrin β1D and DGC Proteins and Intact Sarcolemma—The G domain of all laminin α chains physically interacts with the integrin receptors or with α-dystroglycan. To find out whether loss of the laminin α4 chain alters the expression of integrins or components of DGC, we examined the expression and distribution by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining of β1D integrin and the DGC components α-DG, β-DG, β-SG, and Dys. Adult hearts from 24–40-week-old Lama4–/– mutant mice and their age- and sex-matched controls were analyzed. Western blot analysis revealed that the protein levels of β1D integrin, α-DG, β-DG, and β-SG were comparable between mutant and controls (Fig. 4a). On immunostaining, α-DG, β-DG, β-SG, and Dys (Fig. 4b) and β1D integrin (Data not shown) were observed along the sarcolemma in both wild type control hearts and laminin α4-deficient hearts. However, there was an uneven distribution of α-DG, β-DG, and β-SG in the Lama4–/– hearts (Fig. 4b, arrows) in comparison with that in control hearts. Staining patterns of Dys and β1D integrin were comparable in mutant and control hearts. Blood vessels were not stained with any of the above antibodies. To find out whether the altered distribution of DGC proteins affected sarcolemma integrity, we performed the Evans blue dye permeability assays on mice at 4, 16, and 40 weeks of age. Five mutant and five controls from each age group were used in the study. We did not observe any marked increase in cell permeability in Lama4–/– mutant mice of any age group (data not shown), indicating that the sarcolemma integrity of Lama4–/– mutant mice was not impaired. Abnormal Extracellular Architecture and Multiple Foci Cardiomyocyte Degeneration—Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the heart did not reveal remarkable pathology in Lama4–/– hearts prior to 16 weeks of age (data not shown). Gradually, mutant hearts started to display widening of extravascular space, cardiomyocyte degeneration, and fibrosis as visualized in Fig. 5, a–d, HE staining of hearts from 40-week-old control mice (Fig. 5, a and c) and Lama4–/– mutant mice (Fig. 5, b and d). Wide intercellular space, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, and cardiomyocyte degeneration were observed in mutant hearts. Electron microscopy, performed as described previously (16Forster C. Kietz S. Hultenby K. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14234-14239Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), revealed an early onset of ultra structural abnormalities in Lama4–/– heart. EM studies of 4–8-week-old mice showed normal sarcomere structure and z disc organization. However, the intercellular space in the mutant heart was significantly enlarged (Fig. 5, f and h) compared with its littermate control hearts (Fig. 5, e and g). Moreover, mutant cardiomyocytes had an uneven cell border (Fig. 5, e and g), and the distance between myocyte and its adjacent capillary vessels was greatly enlarged. Blood vessels in the mutant heart were dilated and deformed (Fig. 5, f and h). Histology of older age mice revealed multiple foci of muscle degeneration and fibrosis. The lesions, although varying in severity among individual animals, were observed throughout the heart. Fig. 6a shows Gomori trichrome staining of a Lama4–/– mutant heart at the age of 40 weeks. Multiple foci of muscle degenerative lesions were observed in both right and left ventricular walls, interventricular septum (Fig. 6d), right and left atria, and in the vicinity of the atrial ventricular node (Fig. 6, b and c). Intrinsic Cardiomyocyte Contractility Is Not Impaired—To further determine whether loss of the laminin α4 chain had led to intrinsic mechanical abnormalities in cardiomyocytes, we isolated cardiomyocytes from Lama4–/– mutant and control animals 16–20 weeks of age. A total of about 100 cells of each genotype group, isolated from three mutant and three control mice, were measured. Our results showed that single cell contractility was not impaired in mutant mice. On the contrary, there was an increase in percentage of sarcomere length shortening (ΔSL/SL0), 9.52 ± 0.37% in mutant versus 7.95 ± 0.25% in controls (mean ± S.D., p < 0.001), and the time of both peak contraction and relaxation was decreased; consequently, the maximum rate of contraction (–dSL/dt) was increased in mutant cells, –3.54 ± 0.16 μm/s in mutants versus–2.77 ± 0.10 μm/s in controls (mean ± S.D., p < 0.001), and the maximum rate of relaxation (dSL/dt) was also increased (3.09 ± 0.14 μm/s in mutants versus 2.28 ± 0.10 μm/s in controls, mean ± S.D., p < 0.001) indicating an improvement in contraction in the cardiomyocytes selected (Fig. 7a). Up-regulation of Hypoxia-induced Genes—Blood vessel abnormality and interstitial fibrosis of the heart, as revealed by histology, pointed to the existence of long standing hypoxia in Lama4–/– mutant hearts. To verify this, we collected hearts from mutant and control animals at the age of 16–20 weeks when no marked hypertrophy was observed. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (Hif1) is a transcriptional activator that is expressed in response to hypoxia. Of the two subunits, Hif1α is the hypoxia-responsive subunit, while Hif1β is a constitutively expressed nuclear translocator protein that is irresponsive to hypoxia (17Semenza G.L. Agani F. Feldser D. Iyer N. Kotch L. Laughner E. Yu A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 475: 123-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) is a family of inducible factors that controls the growth of capillaries and angiogenesis (18Ferrara N. Keyt B. Exs. 1997; 79: 209-232PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of Vegfa has been shown to be activated by oxygen tension through Hif (17Semenza G.L. Agani F. Feldser D. Iyer N. Kotch L. Laughner E. Yu A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 475: 123-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee S.H. Wolf P.L. Escudero R. Deutsch R. Jamieson S.W. Thistlethwaite P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). In Lama4–/– heart, there was a significant increase in transcript levels of Hif1a and Vegfa, while the levels of Hif1b remained unchanged (Fig. 7, b and c). An increase in Hif1α protein level in Lama4–/– mutant heart (supplemental Fig. 2) was also observed. We further performed Northern blot analyses and found in mutant hearts a significant increase in ANF transcripts, a representative marker of sustained cardiac hypoxia, cardiac hypertrophy, or heart failure. Expression BNP, an early responsive marker to hypoxia, was not significantly increased in Lama4–/– mutant hearts (Fig. 7, d and e). We did not observe any increase in transcript levels of Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and Hsp27 (Fig. 7, d and e, and data not show); the genes that have been reported to be transiently expressed in respond to the acute phase of ischemia (20Simkhovich B.Z. Marjoram P. Poizat C. Kedes L. Kloner R.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 59: 450-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results were supportive of a long standing hypoxia state of Lama4–/– heart and related cardiomyopathy. We demonstrated in this study that the laminin α4 chain, a constituent of dominant laminin isoforms in blood vessel basement membranes and sarcolemma of the heart, is necessary in maintaining cardiac structure and function. Disruption of the gene resulted in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte degeneration, and cardiac dysfunction. As the laminin α4 chain serves both as a structural and a signaling molecule, we investigated further the pathways of laminin α4 deficiency leading to cardiomyopathy. Normally, DGC and intergrins physically interact with the G domain of the α chain of laminin isoforms, thus serving as two families of receptors for all laminin α chains. It has been hypothesized that the DGC protects the sarcolemma from contraction-induced damage (21Straub V. Rafael J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We have reported previously (8Iivanainen A. Kortesmaa J. Sahlberg C. Morita T. Bergmann U. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27862-27868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), as well as observed in this study that by immunostaining, that the laminin α4 chain is present along sarcolemma from neonatal stage to early adulthood (Fig. 1a and supplemental Fig. 1). Depletion of this protein leads to the up-regulation of the laminin α5 chain. Talts and his colleagues (22Talts J.F. Sasaki T. Miosge N. Gohring W. Mann K. Mayne R. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35192-35199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have reported that G domains in different laminin α chains have different affinity to dystroglycan. The laminin α4 chain is a poor ligand for DGC compared with G domains of the laminin α2 chain (22Talts J.F. Sasaki T. Miosge N. Gohring W. Mann K. Mayne R. Timpl R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35192-35199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This could be one explanation why laminin α4 chain depletion has not affected DCG contents or sarcolemma integrinty, as the laminin α4 chain is not a critical laminin component that interacts with α-DG. Moreover, it has also been observed that laminin deficiency seems to affect myocyte survival through a mechanism independent of sarcolemma integrity, different from that in dystrophin-deficient myopathy animal models. In a comparative study of sarcolemma integrity, laminin α2 chain-deficient mice and dystrophin (mdx)-deficient mice both have developed severe muscular dystrophy with massive myocyte degeneration. However, the former have little Evans blue accumulation in their skeletal muscles (21Straub V. Rafael J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 23Girgenrath M. Dominov J.A. Kostek C.A. Boone Miller J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1635-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), while the later exhibit significant Evans blue accumulation in skeletal muscle fibers (23Girgenrath M. Dominov J.A. Kostek C.A. Boone Miller J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1635-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To explore whether laminin α4 chain deficiency affects cardiomyocyte contractile properties, we found that, on the contrary to impaired function, there was an improvement in the contractile property in Lama4–/– mutant cardiomyocytes. It is most likely that as a subpopulation of cardiomyocytes undergo degeneration, the remaining cells have grown in size and improved their contractile function as a compensatory response. Integrin β1D is a striated muscle-specific integrin β subunit. Integrin β1D has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy (24Ross R.S. Pham C. Shai S.Y. Goldhaber J.I. Fenczik C. Glembotski C.C. Ginsberg M.H. Loftus J.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1160-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Pham C.G. Harpf A.E. Keller R.S. Vu H.T. Shai S.Y. Loftus J.C. Ross R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2916-H2926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cardiomyocyte survival (26Shai S.Y. Harpf A.E. Babbitt C.J. Jordan M.C. Fishbein M.C. Chen J. Omura M. Leil T.A. Becker K.D. Jiang M. Smith D.J. Cherry S.R. Loftus J.C. Ross R.S. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It has been shown that depletion of this subunit leads to cardiomyopathy and cardiomyocyte cell death (26Shai S.Y. Harpf A.E. Babbitt C.J. Jordan M.C. Fishbein M.C. Chen J. Omura M. Leil T.A. Becker K.D. Jiang M. Smith D.J. Cherry S.R. Loftus J.C. Ross R.S. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We demonstrated by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses that the expression of integrin β1D remained unaltered in Lama4–/– mutant mice, suggesting that integrin signaling is unlikely responsible for the cardiomyocyte degeneration and cardiac phenotype observed in these mice. The fact that depletion of this laminin α chain did not affect integrin β1D content nor impair sarcolemma permeability could be due to the fact that the laminin α4 chain constitutes major laminin isoforms of blood vessel rather than that of myocytes in later adulthood. Our data point to the fact that hypoxia/ischemia is responsible for the cardiomyopathy phenotype observed in Lama4–/– mice. First, morphologically as shown by electron microscopy, widening of extracellular matrix space and enlarged distance between myocyte and its adjacent capillary vessels may have caused insufficient oxygen and nutrient supply to cardiomyocytes. Second, in an environment independent of blood supply, cardiomyocytes retain their contractile function. Third, multiple foci of degenerative change and their generalized distribution pattern in the heart are in agreement with a causative defect in the microcirculation. The hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes is likely to be a compensatory response to chronic cell loss resulted from hypoxia/ischemia. Fourth, overexpression of hypoxia-inducible markers, such as Hif1a, Vegfa, and ANF supports the presence of long standing hypoxia, as has been suggested previously (27Simkhovich B.Z. Kloner R.A. Poizat C. Marjoram P. Kedes L.H. Cardiovasc. Pathol. 2003; 12: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The laminin α4 chain constitutes laminin-8 and -9, the ECM of blood vessels. As structural components, laminin-8 and -9 interact with other ECM components, and as signaling molecules, they interact with integrins α3β1 and α6β1, convey signals from outside to inside the cell, and regulate endothelial cell attachment, migration, and proliferation (28Fujiwara H. Kikkawa Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17550-17558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 29Kortesmaa J. Yurchenco P. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14853-14859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), activities different from that in muscle cells. The laminin α4 chain also contributes to blood vessels of other organs such as skeletal muscles. However, no marked structural or functional phenotype was observed in skeletal muscle (30Patton B.L. Cunningham J.M. Thyboll J. Kortesmaa J. Westerblad H. Edstrom L. Tryggvason K. Sanes J.R. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or other organs of these mice. The fact that the heart is the most oxygen-demanding organ, consuming twice as much oxygen as the brain, and 43 times as much as resting skeletal muscles (31Huang Y. Hickey R.P. Yeh J.L. Liu D.

Disruption of the sarcoglycan-sarcospan complex in vascular smooth muscle perturbs vascular function, which initiates cardiomyopathy. Loss of δ-sarcoglycan (dSG) in these animals was mainly associated with irregularities of the coronary vasculature. In contrast to these models, the structure of coronary vessels is not impaired in Lama4–/– mice, as demonstrated by microfil perfusion experiment (supplemental Fig. 3). This observation is in agreement with the expression pattern of the laminin α4 chain in hearts from wild type mice. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, laminin α4 protein is readily detectable in capillaries; however, it is weakly stained or absent from larger vessels. Laminin α5 seems to be the dominant laminin α chain surrounding larger blood vessels. Remarkable pathology observed in Lama4–/–-deficient mice was the irregularity of capillaries and enlargement of space between myocyte and its adjacent capillary vessels, which might cause insufficient oxygen supply and subsequently cardiac phenotype. The cardiac dysfunction, myocyte degeneration, and subsequent compensatory hypertrophy observed in these mice could all be explained by microcirculation dysfunction. We have demonstrated in this study that up-regulation of laminin α5 chain contributes to the survival of Lama4–/– mutant mice. However, this compensation is incomplete. Mice lacking the laminin α4 chain have developed cardiomyopathy, despite compensation of other α chains. So far, the laminin α4 chain has not been linked to any human disorder. Our study provides the first evidence in an animal model that a mutation in this gene might predispose to cardiomyopathy with defective microvascular circulation and chronic myocardial ischemia in certain subpopulations. Screening of this gene for mutation in patients with familial cardiomyopathy might link this gene to this human disorder.

https://openalex.org/W2071463401,"Whole cell voltage clamp experiments were performed in a mouse cortical collecting duct principal cell line using patch pipettes back-filled with a solution containing phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 significantly increased amiloridesensitive current in control cells but not in the cells prestimulated by aldosterone. Additionally, aldosterone stimulated amiloridesensitive current in control cells, but not in the cells that expressed a PIP3-binding protein (Grp1-PH), which sequestered intracellular PIP3. 12 amino acids from the N-terminal tail (APGEKIKAKIKK) of γ-epithelial sodium channel (γ-ENaC) were truncated by PCRbased mutagenesis (γT-ENaC). Whole cell and confocal microscopy experiments were conducted in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells co-expressing α- and β-ENaC only or with either γ-ENaC or γT-ENaC. The data demonstrated that the N-terminal tail truncation significantly decreased amiloride-sensitive current and that both the N-terminal tail truncation and LY-294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) prevented ENaC translocation to the plasmamembrane. These data suggest that PIP3 mediates aldosterone-induced ENaC activity and trafficking and that the N-terminal tail of γ-ENaC is necessary for channel trafficking, probably channel gating as well.

Canessa C.M. Zhang P. Fyfe G.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Since 1994, when ENaC was initially cloned from rat colon (2Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar), the biophysical properties and molecular structure of ENaC have been extensively studied. Several lines of evidence suggest that ENaC is composed of three subunits, α, β, and γ, and that all three subunits are required to form a functional αβγ-ENaC channel complex (2Canessa C.M. Schild L.

Studying the mechanisms that regulate ENaC function is important because abnormal channel activity leads to several severe diseases. Constitutive activation of any component of ENaC subunits can cause Liddle's syndrome, an autosomal dominant inherited disease that causes excessive sodium retention and hypertension. Conversely, loss of function mutations in α-, β-, or γ-ENaC causes pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, a hypotensive condition characterized by an inability to retain salt. These syndromes highlight the importance of normal ENaC activity in the kidney to maintain fluid and sodium homeostasis. The proper regulation of ENaC activity is also very important in the lung, because transgenic mice lacking functional channels die within 40 h of birth from fluid filled airways (10Hummler E. Barker P. Gatzy J. Beermann F. Verdumo C. Schmidt A. Boucher R. Rossier B.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Additionally, increases in intracellular Cl- concentrations that secondarily lead to changes in ENaC activity play an important role in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (11Konig J. Schreiber R. Voelcker T. Mall M. Kunzelmann K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 11: 1047-1051Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Anionic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), are normally located in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and are emerging as important regulators of ion transporters and channels. Although basal levels of both anionic phospholipids are generally very low, several models for the regulation of channels and transporters by PIP2 and PIP3 have been proposed. For example, all members of the inward rectifier potassium channel family (KATP, IRK, GIRK, and ROMK) are thought to be positively regulated by PIP2 interaction (reviewed in Ref. 12Hilgemann D.W. Feng S. Nasuhoglu C. Sci. STKE. 2001; 2001: RE19PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, the best characterized PIP2-binding domain is that of the KATP channels. PIP2 binds directly to the C terminus of the KATP channel, which contains multiple positively charged lysine and arginine residues and maintains an open conformation by preventing ATP binding (13Baukrowitz T. Schulte U. Oliver D. Herlitze S. Krauter T. Tucker S.J. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Science. 1998; 282: 1141-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 14Krauter T. Ruppersberg J.P.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10500-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Classically, PIP3 is considered to be the lipid product generated when activated phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) phosphorylates PIP2 at the 3′ position and is the principle mediator of PI3K effects. Although little is known for its role in regulating the open state of channels, PIP3 does exhibit binding specificity and may be important in ion channel regulation by hormones and growth factors. It has recently been reported that PIP3 binds reversibly to regulators of G protein signaling molecules in cardiac cells to regulate K+ channel activity in response to changes in intracellular calcium levels. In a resting (low Ca2+) state, the action of regulators of G protein signaling is thought to be allosterically inhibited by PIP3 (16Ishii M. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4325-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that anionic phospholipids can regulate various ion channels in many different systems and serve as possible analogous models for PIP3 regulation of ENaC activity in Na+ transporting epithelia. Although the regulation of ENaC has been extensively studied, the specific regulation of ENaC by phosphoinositides remains largely unexplored. However, we have recently demonstrated that application of PIP2 as well as PIP3 to the cytoplasmic surface of apical membranes of A6 cells and injected into Xenopus oocytes heterologously expressing ENaC prevented run down of ENaC activity and increased amiloride-sensitive channel activity in voltage clamp recordings (17Ma H.P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 22654-22663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PIP2 and PIP3 increased the open probability of reconstituted ENaC in excised patches of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Blazer-Yost and Nofziger have recently compared and contrasted the multiple effects of phosphoinositide lipids on ENaC in A6 and Chinese hamster ovary cells in a recent review (20Blazer-Yost B.L. Nofziger C. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2005; 450: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the direct influence of PIP3 on ENaC activity in mpkCCDc14 clones, a mouse collecting duct principle cell line, which maintains aldosterone responsiveness and express functional ENaC endogenously (21Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Vuagniaux G. Vallet V.

We also truncated 12 amino acids from the N-terminal tail of γ-ENaC subunit, suggesting that full-length expression of this subunit is required for normal ENaC trafficking or stability at the plasma membrane. We also demonstrate a novel interaction between γ-ENaC and phospholipids, including PIP2 and PIP3. Cell Culture—The mouse cortical collecting duct principal cell line (mpkCCDc14) is often employed in the study of aldosterone-induced ENaC activity because of their specific responsive to physiological concentrations of mineralocorticoid hormone (21Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Vuagniaux G. Vallet V.

The mpkCCDc14 cells were incubated in a 1:1 mix of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 nm dexamethasone, 1 nm triiodothyronine, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) (obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA) are also routinely used in investigating the regulation of sodium channel activity by exogenously expressing α-, β, and γ-ENaC subunits (19Tong Q. Gamper N. Medina J.L. Shapiro M.S. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22654-22663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar), because these cells do not express a significant amount of endogenous ENaC. MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, and CHO cells were cultured in Hain's F-12-Kaighn medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the mammalian cell lines were maintained in plastic tissue culture flasks at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in air. Generation of cDNA Constructs of Tagged ENaCs—Original plasmids containing cDNAs encoding the wild type α-, β-, and γ-rENaC in pSport vectors were provided by Dr. Bernard C. Rossier (University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland). A γ-rENaC-pDsRed2-N1 construct was created in three steps. First, a 1833-base pair fragment was excised from γ-rENaC-pSport using EcoRI and ApaI restriction enzymes, which was then subsequently ligated into the corresponding cloning sites of pDsRed2-N1 vector (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). In the second step, a 242-base pair PCR fragment was synthesized using pcDNA3-γ-rENaC cDNA as a template, with a sense primer (TTGTTGGGCCCGTAGGCAGA) corresponding to nucleotides 1814-1833 and an antisense primer (ACCGGTCCCAACTCATTGGTCAACT) corresponding to 2048-2032. This primer pair was chosen because unique ApaI and AgeI restriction sites are located within the primer sequences. The 242-base pair amplicon, lacking stop codons, was then QIAquick purified (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and subsequently subcloned into the PGEM-TEasy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). In the third step, PGEM-TEasy containing the 237-base pair PCR product was digested with ApaI/AgeI and then ligated into the pDsRed2-γ-rENaC vector described above. In this way, we eliminated endogenous stop codons and cloned γ-rENaC in frame with pDsRed vector. The β-rENaCpEYFP-N1 and α-rENaC-pECFP-N1 constructs were generated using similar strategies. The γT-ENaC-pDsRed construct, encoding a protein in which the N-terminal tail of ENaC (APGEKIKAKIKK) is truncated, was created in three steps. First, a 36-nucleotide segment from the 5′ end of γ-ENaC was removed by EcoRI and BamHI enzyme digestion. Then a 393-PCR synthesized fragment was generated by using pcDNA3-γ-ENaC as a template and the primer pair 5′-ACCATGGCTCTGCCGGTTCGA and 3′-GGACGGCATGGATCCTGCTT), to recreate the ATG start site and Kozak sequences in the truncated γ-ENaC-pDsRed construct. This was achieved by expressing the 393-base pair PCR fragment in pGEM-TEasy construct and subsequently cloning it in frame with pDsRed EcoRI and BamHI sites. DNA Transfections—mpkCCDc14 cells were transfected with GFP-fused pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of either Grp1 or dynamin construct (obtained from Dr. Mark A. Lemmon, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA); MDCK cells were transfected with fluorescently labeled α-, β-, and γ-ENaC constructs (described above), and CHO cells were transfected with either full-length γ-ENaC or the N-terminal tail truncated γT-ENaC construct or pDsRed vector alone. Each cell line was transfected using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Briefly, the cells were seeded at subconfluent densities 1 day before the transfection. DNA constructs were diluted with serum-free medium (1 μg DNA/50 μl medium), mixed with Plus reagent, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Then Lipofectamine reagent was diluted with serum-free medium (1 μl of Lipofectamine/25 μl of medium), mixed with the DNA/Plus solution, and incubated at room temperature for an additional 15 min. Finally, the transfection solution containing DNA, Plus reagent, and Lipofectamine reagent was applied to the cells and allowed to incubate for 4-6 h at 37 °C before the transfection solution was replaced with regular growth medium. Patch Clamp Recording and Analysis—For patch clamp experiments, either MDCK cells or mpkCCDc14 were grown to confluent densities on permeable polyester membranes. The permeable support allowed patch pipette access to the apical membrane, as well as a physical separation of the apical and basolateral bath compartments. Immediately before use, the cells were thoroughly washed with NaCl bath solution (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, at a pH of 7.4), transferred into the patch recording chamber mounted on a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted microscope, and then visualized with Hoffman modulation optics. The whole cell configuration was established with polished patch pipettes with a tip resistance of 2 mΩ. Only patches with a seal resistance above 10 GΩ were used for the experiments. Pipette solution contained 145 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 50 nm free Ca2+ (after titration with 2 mm EGTA), 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm K2-ATP, and 10 mm HEPES, at a pH of 7.2. A voltage step protocol from -120 mV to +40 mV (in 20-mV intervals) was used to monitor the current using an Axopatch 1-D (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The data were acquired using TL-1 acquisition hardware and analyzed with pClamp software (Axon Instruments). Patch clamp recordings were performed at room temperature. Localization of PIP3 and ENaC Subunits with Laser Confocal Microscopy—According to techniques that have been previously established, the localization of PIP3 can be visualized after transfecting cells with a GFP-fused PH domain (24Gray A. Van Der K.J. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 25Oatey P.B. Venkateswarlu K. Williams A.G. Fletcher L.M. Foulstone E.J. Cullen P.J. Tavare J.M.

Therefore, mpkCCDc14 cells were cultured on glass coverslips and then transiently transfected with the GFP-fused Grp1-PH construct to localize endogenous PIP3 in a collecting duct cell line. Fluorescently labeled ENaC subunits (γ-rENaC-pDsRed2-N1, β-rENaCpEYFP, and α-rENaCpCFP-N1) were also transfected into MDCK cells grown on permeable supports, as described above. Cells transfected with either the GFP-fused Grp1-PH construct or fluorescent vectors containing ENaC subunits were visualized using Zeiss LSM 510 NLO META confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Protein-Lipid Overlay—To test the binding properties of γT-ENaC and wild type γ-ENaC, a protein-lipid overlay was performed using PIP MicroStrips, commercially available from Echelon Biosciences Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT). These strips contain 100 pmol of various phospholipids (listed in Fig. 7), spotted and immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane. Cell lysate from CHO cells that were transiently transfected with full-length γ-ENaC or N-terminal tail truncated γT-ENaC subunits (in the presence of α- and β-ENaC) were overlaid onto the PIP MicroStrips. As a negative control, we also transfected cells with the pDsRed construct only and proceeded with the same experimental protocol. CHO cells were thoroughly rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline before lysing with hypotonic gentle lysis buffer containing: 10 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5%Triton X-100, and freshly prepared 1× protease inhibitor mixture. The nitrocellulose strips were blocked in TBS-T 3% fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Then ∼26 μg/ml protein from CHO cell lysate (expressing either α,β,γT-ENaC or α,β,γ-ENaC) was incubated with the strips in TBS-T 3% fatty acid-free BSA at 4 °C overnight. The strips were then washed with TBS-T/BSA three times with gentle agitation, for 10 min each wash, at room temperature. γT-ENaC and γ-ENaC interaction with spotted phospholipids were detected by subsequently blocking the strips in TBS-T buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 70 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween) with 5% dry milk and then incubating the strips in a 1:10,000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-DsRed-antibody (BD Bioscience, Palo Alto, CA) in blocking buffer for 1 h. IgG-alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary antibody (KPL, Gathersburg, MD) was added (1:5,000 in blocking buffer) and incubated for an additional hour at room temperature. After thorough washes, alkaline phosphatase signal was detected using Nitroblock chemiluminescence enhancer (Tropix, Bedford, MA) and CDP-Star substrate (Tropix) in combination with Kodak Image Station 200MM and Kodak 1D software (Kodak, New Haven, CT). Protein Pull-down Assay—To demonstrate effective γT-ENaC and γ-ENaC expression and interaction with PIP3 in our cell model, we performed additional protein pull-down assays. CHO cells expressing α,β,γ T-ENaC or α,β,γ-ENaC were lysed as described above in gentle lysis buffer. 2 mg of CHO cell lysate incubated overnight, at 4 °C, with 75 μl of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate bound beads (Echelon Biosciences Inc.). The protein-bound beads were then thoroughly washed with TBS-T 3% fatty acid-free BSA three times. The protein was eluted from the beads by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heated at 95 °C. Standard PAGE and immunoblot techniques, described above, were used to detect γT-ENaC and γ-ENaC pull-down with PIP3 after transfer to membrane. We subjected CHO cell lysate expressing DsRed only to the same protein pull-down assay as an appropriate negative control. Statistical Analysis—The data are reported as the mean values ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with SigmaPlot and SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific, CA). Paired or unpaired t tests were used to determine statistical significance between two groups. Analysis of variance was used for multiple comparisons. The results were considered significant if p < 0.05, as we described previously (28Ma H. Ling B.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F798-F805PubMed Google Scholar). PIP3 Stimulates ENaC in Control mpkCCDc14 Cells but Not in Aldosterone-treated mpkCCDc14 Cells—It is well known that blocking production of PIP3 by inhibiting PI3K blocks the effect of aldosterone on sodium transport in renal cells (29Blazer-Yost B.L. Paunescu T.G. Helman S.I. Lee K.D. Vlahos C.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C531-C536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wang J. Barbry P. Maiyar A.C. Rozansky D.J. Bhargava A. Leong M. Firestone G.L. Pearce D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F303-F313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, if an aldosteroneinduced increase in PIP3 is the major cause of the initial hormoneinduced increase in ENaC activity, then the addition of PIP3 to the cytosolic surface of renal cells should increase ENaC activity in the absence of aldosterone. Using the inside-out configuration, we recently demonstrated that PIP3 did not elevate but only maintained ENaC activity in aldosterone-treated A6 cells (17Ma H.P. Saxena S. Warnock D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7641-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the stimulatory effect of PIP3 on ENaC activity may be already saturated in A6 cells that are continuously cultured in the presence of a high concentration of aldosterone. To test this hypothesis, in the present study we performed whole cell voltage clamp experiments in mpkCCDc14 cells, which do not require a high dose of aldosterone for growth and differentiation. Whole cell currents in response to a voltage step protocol (see “Methods and Materials”) were recorded from control mpkCCDc14 cells and aldosterone-treated mpkCCDc14 cells. The patch pipettes were back-filled with a solution containing 10 μm PIP3. Compared with the current immediately after forming the whole cell configuration, amiloride-sensitive current was significantly increased at 5 min (PIP3 had already diffused into the cells) in an aldosterone-free control cell (Fig. 1A) but was not increased or was increased to a lesser degree in an aldosterone-treated cell (Fig. 1B). Amiloride-sensitive currents at -100 mV in control cells were -0.30 ± 0.06 nA (control) and -1.30 ± 0.27 nA (after PIP3) (p < 0.01; n = 5). In contrast, amiloride-sensitive currents at -100 mV in aldosterone-treated cells were -1.56 ± 0.33 nA (control) and -1.69 ± 0.28 nA (after PIP3) (p > 0.05; n = 6), as shown in Fig. 1C. These data suggest that exogenous PIP3 significantly increases amiloride-sensitive sodium current in mpkCCDc14 cells and may mediate the aldosterone-induced increase in ENaC activity. Sequestering PIP3 Reduces Aldosterone-stimulated ENaC Current—PH domains are small stretches of 100-120-amino acid sequences found in many cell signaling and cytoskeletol proteins. PH domains bind with high specificity and affinity to phosphoinositides. In this way, the PH domain directly targets the “host” signaling or cytoskeletol protein to the cellular membrane. Also, the specific binding characteristics of PH domains are utilized in studying PIP2 and PIP3 activity in vivo. For example, the PH domain of Grp1 (Grp1-PH) binds to PIP3 with high specificity and affinity (Kd = 32 nm), (26Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 31Klarlund J.K. Tsiaras W. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32816-32821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and can be used to greatly reduce endogenous PIP3 levels of activity. However, the PH domain of dynamin (Dyn-PH) only weakly associates with PIP3 (Kd = 1.4-4 μm) (32Salim K. Bottomley M.J. Querfurth E. Zvelebil M.J. Gout I. Scaife R. Margolis R.L. Gigg R. Smith C.I.

Biol. 1996; 255: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Therefore, Dyn-PH is an appropriate negative control for experiments sequestering PIP3 with the Grp1-PH expression. The effects of Grp1-PH and Dyn-PH expression in mpkCCDc14 cells on whole cell current are shown in Fig. 2. Very low basal levels of current were recorded from cells before aldosterone treatment, as expected, whether they were untransfected, expressed Grp1-PH domain, or expressed Dyn-PH domain (Fig. 2A). However, after 1 μm aldosterone treatment, whole cell current increased in the untransfected and Dyn-PH control cells but not in mpkCCDc14, in which endogenous PIP3 activity had been sequestered by Grp1-PH domain. The mean amiloride-sensitive current at -100 mV in the presence (black bars) and absence of aldosterone (white bars) is shown in Fig. 2C. PIP3 significantly increased amiloride-sensitive current 5.6- and 8.0-fold in control (-0.26 ± 0.04 nA versus -1.48 ± 0.34 nA, n = 5; p < 0.01) and Dyn-PH-transfected cells (-0.21 ± 0.04 nA versus -1.68 ± 0.30 nA, n = 4; p < 0.01), respectively. Aldosterone, however, did not significantly increase the current in Grp1-PH expressing mpkCCDc14 cells (-0.34 ± 0.07 nA versus -0.50 ± 0.14 nA, n = 6; p > 0.05). In our studies, aldosterone failed to increase ENaC activity in cells that expressed the Grp1-PH domain (which has high binding specificity and affinity to PIP3) compared with cells transfected with another type of PH domain, Dyn-PH, which has low binding affinity for PIP3. This is strong evidence that the PI3-K product, PIP3, specifically mediates the stimulation of ENaC by aldosterone. Aldosterone Elevates Membrane PIP3 Concentration via PI3K—As we have described above, the Grp1-PH domain binds strongly and specifically to PIP3 and is therefore commonly employed in the study of PIP3 in vivo. By fusing Grp1-PH to GFP, we were able to localize PIP3 expression in mpkCCDc14 cells. In the absence of serum and aldosterone, we expect GFP-Grp1-PH expression to be evenly distributed across the cytoplasm with low fluorescence intensity, because PIP3 levels under resting conditions are very low. However, aldosterone-induced activation of PI3K should enhance PIP3 levels at the plasma membrane. To test our hypothesis that aldosterone elevates membrane PIP3 concentrations via PI3K, we first transfected mpkCCDc14 cells with the GFP-fused Grp1-PH domain (Fig. 3). The cells that were deprived of serum and hormone did not contain significant amounts of PIP3. In this basal state, the expressed GFP-fused Grp1-PH domain was distributed with an even intensity across the whole cytoplasm of mpkCCDc14 cells as expected (left panel). Cells treated with 1 μm aldosterone for 30 min (middle panel) displayed predominant GFP-fluorescence intensity at the plasma membrane. This effect was prevented by pretreating the cells with 5 μm LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor (right panel), indicating that aldosterone can elevate the concentration of PIP3 in the plasma membrane (where functional ENaC resides) by stimulating PI3K. These data suggest that PIP3 is an important regulator of aldosterone-induced sodium channel activity. Truncation of γ-ENaC N-termin"

The root mean square fluctuations, defining flexibility, were found to be similar for both enzymes (1.5 Å) at their optimal activity temperature. Resilience values, defining structural rigidity, are higher by an order of magnitude for the high temperature-adapted protein (0.15 Newtons/meter for O. cunniculus lactate dehydrogenase and 1.5 Newtons/meter for M. jannaschii malate dehydrogenase). Thermoadaptation appears to have been achieved by evolution through selection of appropriate structural rigidity in order to preserve specific protein structure while allowing the conformational flexibility required for activity.

Thermoadaptation appears to have been achieved by evolution through selection of appropriate structural rigidity in order to preserve specific protein structure while allowing the conformational flexibility required for activity. Hyperthermophilic organisms grow at temperatures above 80 °C. Proteins from these organisms are themselves optimally active between 60 and 125 °C and serve as paradigms for the characterization of factors responsible for protein fold stability and flexibility. Hyperthermophilic enzymes have also attracted considerable attention because of a range of biotechnological applications (1Adams M.W. Perler F.B. Kelly R.M. Biotechnology (NY). 1995; 13: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 2Adams M.W. Kelly R.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison studies and structural analyses carried out on hyperthermophilic proteins and their mesophilic homologues have shown that thermal stability is associated with multiple factors, including an increase in hydrogen bonding, complex salt bridge formation, and helix stabilization by acidic residues. The commonly accepted hypothesis is that increased thermal stability is due to enhanced conformational rigidity of the molecular structure (3Jaenicke R. Naturwissenschaften. 1996; 83: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Hyperthermophilic enzymes are also characterized by a higher temperature of maximum activity (3Jaenicke R. Naturwissenschaften. 1996; 83: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 4Zavodszky P. Kardos J. Svingor G.A. Petsko G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7406-7411Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The more rigid hyperthermophilic enzyme would then require higher temperatures to achieve the requisite conformational flexibility for activity. Experiments have shown that thermostable enzymes exhibit reduced structural flexibility at room temperature with respect to their mesophilic homologues (4Zavodszky P. Kardos J. Svingor G.A. Petsko G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7406-7411Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 5Wrba A. Schweiger A. Schultes V. Jaenicke R. Zavodsky P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7584-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), whereas others, on α-amylase (6Fitter J. Heberle J. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1629-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and on rubredoxin (7Hernandez G. Jenney Jr., F.E. Adams M.W. LeMaster D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3166-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Grottesi A. Ceruso M.A. Colosimo A. Di Nola A. Proteins. 2002; 46: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), have shown the opposite effect, i.e. the thermostable homologues were found to be more flexible, suggesting stabilization through entropic effects. Relations between flexibility and stability are, therefore, complex. Atomic fluctuations only were measured in these experiments and interpreted in terms of flexibility. It is important to point out that reduced structural “flexibility” does not necessarily imply a more “rigid” structure. Atoms are maintained in a structure by forces that link them to their neighbors. In terms of a force field, the width of the potential well in which an atom moves is a measure of its flexibility in terms of a root mean square fluctuation amplitude (<u2>), whereas the detailed shape of the well reflects the rigidity of the structure, in terms of an effective force constant (<k>). In this picture, the stability would be given by the depth of the well (9Tehei M. Madern D. Pfister C. Zaccai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14356-14361Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Two types of potential wells are illustrated in Fig. 1. In the case of harmonic motion (Fig. 1A), flexibility and rigidity are related, as expected intuitively. The potential is given by V(u)=12<k>u2, and the atomic mean square fluctuation is related to the force constant by <u2(T)>= kBT/<k> (10Bicout D.J. Zaccai G. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1115-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Zaccai G. Science. 2000; 288: 1604-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar); a less rigid harmonic structure is indeed more flexible. Protein structures, however, are not harmonic at physiological temperature, and atoms move in different types of potential. Fig. 1B illustrates a simplified, extreme case in which an atom can move quite freely in a “box” formed by its neighbors but cannot go out of the box. Mathematically this can be described by the square well potential shown. The flexibility, in this case, is a temperature-independent constant value, while the effective force constant stopping the atom from leaving the box is infinitely high. Flexibility and rigidity are independent parameters therefore that, as shown below, can be obtained separately from neutron scattering data. We proposed a novel neutron scattering approach that provides independent measurements of the atomic mean fluctuations in a protein structure (the global thermal flexibility) and of the mean force constant maintaining the structure, which we called resilience because “rigidity” has been used in a broadly qualitative way (11Zaccai G. Science. 2000; 288: 1604-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 12Zaccai G. Tehei M. Scherbakova I. Serdyuk I. Gerez C. Pfister C. J. Phys. IV. 2000; 10Google Scholar). In the present work, the combined analysis of neutron data on dynamics, on the one hand, with activity and stability data, on the other, for hyperthermophilic and mesophilic enzymes of the malate lactate dehydrogenase family revealed a strong adaptation of resilience and mean square fluctuations to physiological temperature. By performing comparative analysis using the sequences and the three-dimensional crystal structures, we suggested mechanisms that govern the high thermal stability of Methanococcus jannaschii malate dehydrogenase (Mj MalDH) 3The abbreviations used are: Mj MalDHMethanococcus jannaschii malate dehydrogenaseOc LDHOryctolagus cunniculus lactate dehydrogenaseN/mNewtons/meterSs LDHSus scrofa LDH. through increased resilience. Methanococcus jannaschii malate dehydrogenase Oryctolagus cunniculus lactate dehydrogenase Newtons/meter Sus scrofa LDH. Oryctolagus cunniculus lactate dehydrogenase (Oc LDH) was from Sigma. Mj MalDH was prepared as described in Ref. 13Madern D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1515-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar. Activity—The measurements of the rate of NADH oxidation at 340 nm were carried out in a 1.00-cm thermostated cuvette containing 0.2 mm NADH and 0.6 mm appropriate substrate buffered with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Pyruvate and oxaloacetate were used with Oc LDH and Mj MalDH, respectively. The optimal activity was expressed as the percentage of the maximal activity relative for each enzyme. Stability—Samples of Oc LDH and Mj MalDH were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 30 min at the specified temperature, and their residual activities were measured. The samples were covered with paraffin oil to avoid evaporation at high temperature. The guanidinium hydrochloride-induced unfolding of Oc LDH and Mj MalDH was monitored using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Samples (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, for 24 h at the specified GdnHCl concentration. Far-UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded between 190 and 260 nm with an interval of 1 nm and an integration time of 15 s. Neutron Scattering Experiments—Samples for neutron scattering were concentrated protein solutions (∼200 mg/ml) in 20 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 buffer. Experiments were performed on the back-scattering spectrometer IN13 at the Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble, France (information on the institute and the instrument is available at www.ill.fr). The incident neutron wavelength used was λ = 2.23 Å. Neutron spectrometers are characterized by their energy resolution, Δω, and scattering vector, Q, range, corresponding to time and space windows related to 1/Δω and 1/Q, respectively. Elastic incoherent scattering data were collected with an energy resolution of 8 μeV in a scattering vector range of 1.2 Å-1≤Q ≤2.2 Å-1, corresponding to a space-time measurement window of ∼1 Å in 0.1 ns. Samples were contained in aluminum sample holders with a 0.3-mm path length. Correction for multiple scattering was not performed because the transmission of all samples was ∼90%, indicating that this effect can be neglected. Corrections for self absorption using Paalman-Pings coefficients were carried out with standard programs. All samples, including the vanadium and empty aluminum can, were oriented at 135° with respect to the incident neutron beam direction. The scattering of the buffer alone was much lower than the protein solution scattering, barely above the scattering of the aluminum container. It (the scattering of the buffer) was subtracted from the data with no correction for protein-excluded volume. The data were normalized by the vanadium scattering to correct for detector response. In the instrument space-time window and according to a Gaussian approximation, the incoherent elastic scattered intensity can be analyzed as (14Smith J.C. Q Rev. Biophys. 1991; 24: 227-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) I (Q, 0±Δω) = constant·exp{(1/6) (-<u2> Q2)}, where Q is 4πsinθ/λ, 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ the incident neutron wavelength; <u2> values include all contributions to motions in the accessible space and time windows from vibrational fluctuations (usually expressed as a Debye-Waller factor) as well as from diffusional motions. The validity of the Gaussian approximation for the mean square fluctuation <u2> and its analogy to the Guinier formalism for small angle scattering by particles in solution has been discussed by Réat et al. (15Réat V. Zaccai G. Ferrand M. Pfister C. Cusack S. Büttner H. Ferrand M. Langan P. Timmins P. Biological Macromolecular Dynamics. Adenine Press, Schenectady, NY1997: 117-122Google Scholar) and more recently by Gabel (16Gabel F. Eur. Biophys. J. 2005; 34: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the Guinier formalism a radius of gyration Rg2 of particles in solution is calculated (17Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, New York, London1955Google Scholar). The particle equivalent is the volume swept out by a single proton during the time scale of the experiment (∼100 ps). The analogy holds if the motion is localized well within the space-time window defined by the Q and energy transfer ranges, respectively. The Guinier approximation is valid if Rg2*Q2≈1. Following our definition of <u2>, Rg2=1/2*<u2>. As a consequence, the Gaussian approximation is valid in the domain where <u2>*Q2≈2. The mean square fluctuations <u2> at a given temperature T were calculated according to the Gaussian approximation as (Fig. 2): Ln [I (Q, 0±Δω)] = constant + A* Q2. The mean square fluctuations were therefore calculated as: <u2> = -6 A. The <u2> values were then plotted as a function of absolute temperature T (Fig. 3). The value of the root mean square fluctuation <u2> in absolute Å units quantifies the global flexibility of the system studied. An effective mean force constant <k′>, defining mean resilience, can be calculated from the derivative of <u2> plotted versus temperature T (10Bicout D.J. Zaccai G. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1115-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Zaccai G. Science. 2000; 288: 1604-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3): <k′>= 0.00276/(d <u2>/dT). The numerical constants allow the expression of <k′> in N/m with <u2> in Å2 and T in Kelvin. The mean square fluctuations <u2>, the effective force constants <k′>, and their respective errors were calculated from the slopes of weighted straight line fits using the Marquart-Levenberg algorithm. Sequence and Structural Comparison—The sequence comparison was performed using the program BLAST (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59913) Google Scholar). The structural alignment was performed using the program VAST (19Gibrat J.F. Madej T. Bryant S.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) and rendered graphically with Cn3D (20Wang Y. Geer L.Y. Chappey C. Kans J.A. Bryant S.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 300-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond interactions were listed using the program HBPlus (21McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar). Ion-pair analysis was performed using X-PLOR (22Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 867-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) with distance cutoffs of 4 Å. Water-accessible surface area and water-enzyme hydrogen bond interactions were calculated and listed using DSSP (23Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12326) Google Scholar). Molecular protein volume and cavities were calculated with the program VOIDOO (24Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). A probe radius of 1.4 Å was used for cavity calculations. Secondary structure assignment was calculated using Cn3D (20Wang Y. Geer L.Y. Chappey C. Kans J.A. Bryant S.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 300-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Malate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophile archaeon Mj MalDH was compared with its mesophilic homologue, the lactate dehydrogenase from O. cunniculus muscle (Oc LDH). Mj MalDH is a member of the LDH-like family of malate dehydrogenases, which are tetrameric and have similar structures to the LDH (13Madern D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1515-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Lee B.I. Chang C. Cho S.J. Eom S.H. Kim K.K. Yu Y.G. Suh S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Madern D. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Activity and Stability—The instantaneous activities of the enzymes were measured as a function of temperature (Fig. 4A). The temperatures of optimal activity are 37 °C for Oc LDH and 90 °C for Mj MalDH. The relative stabilities of the enzymes were assessed by residual activity measurements and CD using guanidinium hydrochloride as denaturant (Fig. 4, B and C). The residual activity is abolished in Oc LDH after incubation at ∼50 °C and in Mj MalDH after incubation above 90 °C. The guanidinium chloride unfolding transition concentrations for Oc LDH and Mj MalDH are 1.3 and 2.1 m, respectively. Taken together, these data show that the hyperthermophilic protein is significantly more stable. Macromolecular Dynamics Study—Various experimental methods have been applied to explore protein dynamics adaptation to high temperature. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (4Zavodszky P. Kardos J. Svingor G.A. Petsko G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7406-7411Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), fluorescence quenching (27Fitter J. Haber-Pohlmeier S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9589-9599Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), high-resolution NMR (28Bertini I. Luchinat C. Niikura Y. Presenti C. Proteins. 2000; 41: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and neutron scattering (29Fitter J. Herrmann R. Dencher N.A. Blume A. Hauss T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10723-10731Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) are probably the major ones. The flexibility of protein molecules is reflected in conformational fluctuations. These reversible local rearrangements expose buried segments of the polypeptide chain to solvent. In D2O, hydrogen/deuterium exchange occurs during such exposure, and the probability distribution of the accessibility of protein hydrogens can be determined by hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments providing a measure of protein fluctuations. These experiments do not provide total protein dynamics and must be performed in D2O, which may affect the activity, the stability, and the dynamics of proteins (9Tehei M. Madern D. Pfister C. Zaccai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14356-14361Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 30Bonnete F. Madern D. Zaccai G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching experiments measure structural flexibility and integrity for protein structures. They require the use of a quencher, for example acrylamide, for the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence. In general, however, different tryptophan residues have a different accessibility to the quencher, and the quenching behavior is only weakly coupled to structural fluctuations. NMR permits the study of backbone dynamics in proteins. The method usually requires isotope enrichment of the protein by 15N labeling and provides information essentially in terms of order parameters and entropies. There is an overlap between the time scales of neutron scattering experiments and those of NMR. Neutron scattering experiments can be performed under close to physiological condition on proteins of any size and do not require isotope labeling, although D2O solvent or deuterium labeling can be used to explore specific effects. The method provides direct information on atomic fluctuation amplitudes in a given time scale in absolute units. Neutron scattering experiments were performed on the IN13 spectrometer at the Institut Laue Langevin (Grenoble). We recall that the space-time window of the experiments corresponds to ∼1 Å in 0.1 ns. Motions outside the window, such as the diffusion of bulk water (∼10 Å in 0.1 ns), for example, did not contribute to the scattering signal, so that experiments could be performed in H2O solvent, close to physiological conditions (we recall that many of the previous neutron scattering experiments were performed in heavy water). In this space-time window, H atoms reflect the motions of the side chains and backbone atom groups to which they are bound and thus provide information on protein dynamics (31Gabel F. Bicout D. Lehnert U. Tehei M. Weik M. Zaccai G. Q Rev. Biophys. 2002; 35: 327-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The mean square fluctuation <u2> of the sample atoms was measured as a function of temperature. Two parameters providing information on dynamics were analyzed: the value of the root mean square fluctuation <u2> in absolute Å units, which quantifies the global flexibility of the protein, and the mean resilience <k′> in absolute N/m units, calculated from the slope of <u2> versus T (11Zaccai G. Science. 2000; 288: 1604-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The global mean square fluctuations <u2> in the proteins measured by neutron scattering as a function of temperature are shown in Fig. 3. In the explored temperature range, the <u2> of the hyperthermophilic protein lie above those of its mesophilic homologue. This result is in agreement with neutron studies on α-amylases that showed larger fluctuation amplitudes for the thermophilic protein (6Fitter J. Heberle J. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1629-1636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It should not be concluded, however, that this higher flexibility implies a lower rigidity (see above). Because of technical constraints, the mean square fluctuation at 90 °C for Mj MalDH, the temperature of its optimal activity, was obtained by linear extrapolation at 2.3 Å2, corresponding to a root mean square fluctuation (flexibility) of 1.5 Å. This value for Mj MalDH is essentially identical to that for Oc LDH at 37 °C. The observation suggests that the enzymes have conformational flexibility adjusted to the optimum working temperature in accordance with the hypothesis that adaptation of proteins to different physiological temperatures tends to maintain enzymes in “corresponding states” characterized by similar conformational flexibility (32Jaenicke R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 715-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The mean resilience values of the protein structures were calculated as effective mean force constants from the slopes of <u2> versus T in Fig. 3. A smaller slope indicates a more resilient (rigid) protein structure and vice versa. The mean resilience is an order of magnitude larger for Mj MalDH (1.50 N/m) than for Oc LDH (0.15 N/m). For comparison, we recall that the resilience of MalDH from Haloarcula marismortui measured in 2 m NaCl H2O solution is 0.11 N/m (9Tehei M. Madern D. Pfister C. Zaccai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14356-14361Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The resilience of myoglobin as a D2O-hydrated powder is 2 N/m below 200 K (minus 73 °C) and drops to ∼0.3 N/m at physiological temperature (11Zaccai G. Science. 2000; 288: 1604-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The higher stability of Mj MalDH is, therefore, correlated with resilience ∼10-fold higher than the resilience of mesophilic protein. What are the sequence and structural mechanisms that govern the higher stability and resilience of Mj MalDH? Sequence and Structural Determinants Associated with Thermal Adaptation—The Mj MalDH enzyme subunit is made up of 30% charged residues (lysine, aspartate, arginine, and glutamate), which is by far larger than the corresponding fraction (∼21.7%) found in the mesophile Oc LDH. The fraction of lysine residues (8.6% of the total number of residues) in Mj MalDH is comparable with that found in Oc LDH (8.1%). The fractions of arginine, aspartate, and glutamate in Mj MalDH representing 5.8, 7, and 8.6% are much larger than the corresponding fractions (3, 5.1, and 5.5%) found in Oc LDH. A correlation has been published between adaptation to high temperature and the average charged minus noncharged polar (asparagine, glutamine, serine, and threonine) amino acid percentage (Ch-Pol) in protein structures (33Cambillau C.

The fraction of polar residues is 13.7 and 18.7% in Mj MalDH and Oc LDH, respectively. The Ch-Pol value is therefore much higher for Mj MalDH (16.3%) than for Oc LDH (3%). The obvious strong correlation between the effective resilience and the average percentage (Ch-Pol) provided a hint as to which protein stabilization forces are affected by thermoadaptation. The increase of the Ch-Pol value for the Mj MalDH, compared with Oc LDH, is largely due to an increase in charged residues (62.4%) that favors hydrogen bonds, hydration interactions (34Madern D. Ebel C. Zaccai G. Extremophiles. 2000; 4: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and ion pairs and therefore leads to a dominance of the enthalpic (H-bonds, hydration interactions, ion pairs) contributions to the free energy landscape. The three-dimensional crystal structure of the enzyme Oc LDH is not yet determined. However, to address the structural implications of the correlation between resilience and adaptation to high temperature, we selected a mesophilic homologue of Oc LDH whose structure has been solved. Lactate dehydrogenase from Sus scrofa (pig) muscle (Ss LDH) belongs to the same phylogenetic domain and has the same optimum physiological temperature and number of amino acids as Oc LDH. Its denaturation temperature also is about the same as that of Oc LDH. Moreover, the two proteins display a strong sequence identity (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONECharacteristics of Mj MalDH, Ss LDH and Oc LDHMj MalDHSs LDHOc LDHPhylogenetic domainArchaeaEukaryaEukaryaOptimum temperature of activity from this work90 / 85aPhysiological temperature optimum of source organism.37aPhysiological temperature optimum of source organism.37 / 37aPhysiological temperature optimum of source organism.Number of amino acids313332332Sequence identity (%)bAmino acid sequence identity and similarity vs, Mj MalDH.2829 / 90cAmino acid sequence identity and similarity vs. Ss LDH.Sequence similarity (%)bAmino acid sequence identity and similarity vs, Mj MalDH.5252 / 94cAmino acid sequence identity and similarity vs. Ss LDH.Thermal denaturation (°C)87dThermal denaturation from this work45eTaken from Ref. 42.52dThermal denaturation from this workProtein Data Bank code used for structural comparison1HYG9LDTResolution (Å)2.82.0R.m.s.d. vs. Mj MalDH (Å)fR.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.2.2a Physiological temperature optimum of source organism.b Amino acid sequence identity and similarity vs, Mj MalDH.c Amino acid sequence identity and similarity vs. Ss LDH.d Thermal denaturation from this worke Taken from Ref. 42Hennig M.

Open table in a new tab The structural alignment of the Ss LDH monomer with Mj MalDH structure (TABLE ONE and Fig. 5) shows a high degree of conservation of the overall three-dimensional fold. The total volume occupied by the Mj MalDH tetramer is smaller (by 8%) than that occupied by the tetramer of Ss LDH. Improvement in packing density can be obtained also by a reduction in the number and total volume of internal cavities (35Dalhus B. Saarinen M. Sauer U.H. Eklund P. Johansson K. Karlsson A. Ramaswamy S. Bjork A. Synstad B. Naterstad K. Sirevag R. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 707-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Two cavities are present in the Mj MalDH monomer, and they constitute a total volume of 64 Å3. The number and the total volume (by ∼91%) of internal cavities of Mj MalDH monomer are smaller than that present in the Ss LDH monomer (TABLE TWO). Cavities are energetically unfavorable due to a loss of van der Waals contacts (36Pakula A.A. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 289-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Filling or creating cavities by site-directed mutagenesis can increase or decrease the thermostability of proteins (37Matsumura M. Becktel W.J. Matthews B.W. Nature. 1988; 334: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 38Eriksson A.E. Baase W.A. Zhang X.J. Heinz D.W. Blaber M. Baldwin E.P. Matthews B.W. Science. 1992; 255: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), and the most destabilizing replacements tend to occur in the most rigid parts of a protein structure (39Alber T. Sun D.P. Nye J.A. Muchmore D.C. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3754-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The water-accessible surface area (WASA) allows quantification of the extent to which atoms on the protein surface can form contacts with water. The WASA of Mj MalDH is slightly smaller (by 1%) than that of Ss LDH (TABLE TWO). The WASA has energetic significance in that it is directly related to hydrophobic free energies. The reduction of each square Angström of WASA yields a gain in free energy of 25 cal mol-1 (40Chothia C. Nature. 1974; 248: 338-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). There is an improvement of the packing density for Mj MalDH, which favors the resilience increasing through a dominance of the enthalpic (increase of van der Waals contacts, small decrease of hydrophobic free energies) contributions to the free energy landscape.TABLE TWOStructural comparison observationsMj MalDHSs LDHMj MalDH structure comparisons performed with Ss LDHTotal volume decreased (106 Å3)1.1641.261+Number of internal cavities decreased (per monomer)26+Total cavity volume decreased (per monomer) (Å3)64122.5+Total water-accessible surface area decreased (per dimer) (Å2)2620426499+Increased number of intrasubunit ion pairs (per monomer/residue)15/0.04810/0.03+Increased number of hydrogen bonds water-enzyme/residue (dimer)1.541.41+Increased secondary structure content (%)6462+Increased number of hydrogen bonds/residue (dimer)0.8930.889+ Open table in a new tab The Ch-Pol value is much higher for Mj MalDH (16.3%) than for Ss LDH (3.3%). The charged residues are likely to favor ion pairs, hydration interactions, and hydrogen bonds. Ion pairs have been proposed to play a key role in the maintenance of enzyme stability at high temperature (41Russell R.J. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 1157-1167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 42Hennig M. Darimont B. Sterner R. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The number of intrasubunit ion pairs in Mj MalDH is increased significantly (50%) compared with its mesophilic counterparts (TABLE TWO), confirming the proposed stabilizing effect of ion pairs. Because the majority of charged residues are located on the protein surface, interaction with the solvent is also an important feature for stability. Neutron scattering experiments on the halophilic malate dehydrogenase from Haloarcula marismortui show that the enzyme is more resilient under solvent conditions where it is more stable (9Tehei M. Madern D. Pfister C. Zaccai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14356-14361Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The number of potential water-enzyme hydrogen bonds/residue is higher for Mj MalDH dimer (by 9%) than that of the equivalent dimeric unit of Ss LDH (TABLE TWO). Mj MalDH has fewer amino acid residues than its mesophilic homologues. In Mj MalDH, 39% of the amino acid residues are located in α helices and 25% in β strands. The difference with Ss LDH is small but significant, as the α helix and β strand contents of the mesophilic homologues are 36 and 26%, respectively. Therefore, the fraction of residues belonging to secondary structure elements in Mj MalDH is slightly higher (by 3%) than what is seen in Ss LDH (TABLE TWO). The increase in secondary structure leads to a reduction in the lengths of the external loops and to an increase in the number of hydrogen bonds. Effectively, the number of hydrogen bonds/residue is slightly higher for Mj MalDH (TABLE TWO). We note, however, that the higher resolution of the Ss LDH structure (2 Å compared with 2.8 Å for Mj MalDH structure) probably led to the proper identification of more hydrogen bonding interactions, suggesting the difference may be significantly higher. All these Mj MalDH structural features contribute to a global increase in protein resilience, through enthalpic (ion pairs, hydration interactions, and hydrogen bond) contributions to the free energy landscape. Our results emphasized how the distinction between protein stability and enzyme activity is reflected in a corresponding distinction between resilience and flexibility. The structural bases of thermophilic stability in the (LDH-like) malate dehydrogenase group have been discussed (35Dalhus B. Saarinen M. Sauer U.H. Eklund P. Johansson K. Karlsson A. Ramaswamy S.

This study indicates that several factors, such as increased (Ch-Pol) value of protein sequence and increased packing density, as well as a reduction of number and total volume of internal cavities, increased ion pairs, and increased hydrogen bond interactions, are responsible for a more stable protein and contribute to an observed increase in protein resilience, suggesting the dominance of enthalpic contributions to the free energy landscape in the thermoadaptation. For proteins in which entropic effects are dominant, a less resilient macromolecule will be more thermostable."
https://openalex.org/W1968221228,"It has been proposed that C-terminal two α-helices of the ϵ subunit of F1-ATPase can undergo conformational transition between retracted folded-hairpin form and extended form. Here, using F1 from thermophilic Bacillus PS3, we monitored this transition in real time by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a donor dye and an acceptor dye attached to N terminus of the γ subunit and C terminus of the ϵ subunit, respectively. High FRET (extended form) of F1 turned to low FRET (retracted form) by ATP, which then reverted as ATP was hydrolyzed to ADP. 5′-Adenyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate, ADP + AlF4-, ADP + NaN3, and GTP also caused the retracted form, indicating that ATP binding to the catalytic β subunits induces the transition. The ATP-induced transition from high FRET to low FRET occurred in a similar time scale to the ATP-induced activation of ATPase from inhibition by the ϵ subunit, although detailed kinetics were not the same. The transition became faster as temperature increased, but the extrapolated rate at 65 °C (physiological temperature of Bacillus PS3) was still too slow to assign the transition as an obligate step in the catalytic turnover. Furthermore, binding affinity of ATP to the isolated ϵ subunit was weakened as temperature increased, and the dissociation constant extrapolated to 65 °C reached to 0.67 mm, a consistent value to assume that the ϵ subunit acts as a sensor of ATP concentration in the cell.

Yoshida and T. Suzuki determined the crystal structure of F1 that has the ϵ subunit with fully extended α-helices (unpublished data). (Fig. 1C) (9Suzuki T. Murakami T. Iino R. Suzuki J. Ono S. Shirakihara Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46840-46846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Biochemical data have indicated that the ϵ subunit adopts the extended form in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ADP, in which ATPase activity is inhibited, and that ATP counteracts ADP by favoring the retracted form, which is a non-inhibitory conformation (9Suzuki T. Murakami T. Iino R. Suzuki J. Ono S. Shirakihara Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46840-46846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the regulatory function of the ϵ subunit is dependent on the drastic conformational transition that is affected by nucleotide and other factors. However, previous studies have not provided kinetic information on how these dynamic conformational transitions occur in the enzyme at work. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a powerful technique that enables us to probe conformational dynamics of biological molecular machines (10Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). In this study, this technique was applied to the ϵ subunit in F1 from thermophilic Bacillus PS3. Real-time FRET monitoring revealed slow, reversible conformational change of the ϵ subunit, indicating that the ϵ subunit exerts a slow switch-like regulation. In addition, direct binding of ATP to the isolated ϵ subunit was probed by fluorescence change of the dye attached to the ϵ subunit. Submillimolar affinity of the ϵ subunit to ATP at the physiological temperature of Bacillus PS3 (65 °C) suggests a novel function of the ϵ subunit as an ATP concentration sensor in vivo. Protein Preparation—A mutant of the α3β3γ subcomplex (αC193S, βHis-10 at N terminus, γS3C) and mutants of the ϵ subunit (134C or Q107C) of F1 from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 were purified as described (11Shimabukuro K.

Chem. 2003; 278: 36013-36016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ATPase activity of reconstituted α3β3γϵ subcomplex (referred as F1 hereafter) was measured as described previously (9Suzuki T. Murakami T. Iino R. Suzuki J. Ono S. Shirakihara Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46840-46846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A molecular extinction coefficient of 154,000 at 280 nm was used for the determination of F1 concentration. Reconstitution of Fluorescent-labeled α3β3γϵ Complex—For FRET measurement, α3β3γ subcomplex and ϵ subunit (134C) were reacted with Cy3- and Cy5-maleimide (Amersham Biosciences, dye/protein molar ratio was 2) in PA5 buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.5) for 30 min at 25 °C, respectively, and unreacted dyes were removed by gel filtration. Labeling ratio of dye to protein was ∼0.5 and >0.9 for α3β3γ(S3C-Cy3) and ϵ(134C-Cy5), respectively (judged by SDS-PAGE). For reconstitution of α3β3γ(S3C-Cy3) ϵ(134C-Cy5) subcomplex, α3β3γ(S3C-Cy3) and ϵ(134C-Cy5) were mixed (molar ratio of ϵ subunit to α3β3γ was 3) and incubated for 3 h at 25°C, and excess ϵ(134C-Cy5) was removed by ultrafiltration. Reconstituted F1 contained 0.66 mol of ADP and 0.26 mol of ATP/mol of F1 and retained 76% steady-state ATPase activity as compared with that of wild type (134 ± 4.0 s-1 measured at 50 °C). From this result we concluded that dye-labeled F1 used in this study was functional. Molecular extinction coefficients of 150,000 at 550 nm (Cy3) and 250,000 at 650 nm (Cy5) were used for determination of concentration. FRET Measurement—FRET from the donor to the acceptor in the F1 was monitored with a fluorescence spectrometer (FP-3000, Hitachi). Donor was selectively excited with the light of 532 nm (bandwidth was 3 nm). For time course measurements, fluorescence intensity of donor was measured at 565 nm (bandwidth was 10 nm). Measurements were carried out in PA5 buffer, and an ATP (GTP) regenerating system (5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 0.5 mg/ml pyruvate kinase) was added in some experiments as described. Contamination of ATP in the solutions of AMPPNP and GTP was less than 0.1% (estimated by high performance liquid chromatography). Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of protein-conjugated Cy3 and Cy5 in the buffer PA5 was measured in a cuvette with a fluorescence spectrometer (FP-3000). Measurement of Affinity between Nucleotides and Isolated ϵ Subunit—The Q107C mutant of the ϵ subunit was reacted with Cy3-maleimide (dye/protein molar ratio was 2), and unreacted dyes were removed by gel filtration. The labeling ratio of dye to protein was >0.9. Nucleotide was added to ϵ(Q107C-Cy3) in PA5 buffer, and fluorescence intensity was measured with a fluorescence spectrometer (FP-3000). Cy3 was excited with the light of 532 nm (bandwidth was 3 nm), and fluorescence intensity was measured at 565 nm (bandwidth was 10 nm). For the measurement of ADP affinity, hexokinase (6.7 units/ml) and glucose (200 mm) were supplemented to the buffer, and contaminated ATP was converted to ADP. Nucleotide-dependent, Reversible Conformational Change of the ϵ Subunit—In a fluorescence spectrum of α3β3γ(S3C-Cy3)ϵ(134C-Cy5) obtained by excitation of donor dye (Cy3) at 532 nm (Fig. 2A, blue solid line), the peak of donor (Cy3, around 570 nm) decreased, as compared with the spectrum of α3β3γ(S3C-Cy3) (blue dashed line). Concomitantly the peak of acceptor (Cy5, around 670 nm) increased, indicating FRET from donor to acceptor with high efficiency. FRET was further confirmed by recovery of donor fluorescence intensity after photobleaching of acceptor by excitation at 670 nm (data not shown). When ATP (1 mm) was added, although the spectra of α3β3γ(S3C-Cy3) (red dashed line) and ϵ(134C-Cy5) (red dotted line) did not change, intensities of donor and acceptor fluorescence of α3β3γ(S3C-Cy3)ϵ(34C-Cy5) (red solid line) were increased and decreased, respectively. This ATP-induced transition from high FRET to low FRET primarily reflects the conformational change of the ϵ subunit because the γ and ϵ subunits rotate together as a body and the γ subunit does not undergo large conformational transition during catalysis. Hereafter, α3β3γ(S3C-Cy3)ϵ(134C-Cy5) subcomplex was referred as F1 in this study and was used for FRET measurement. Apparent FRET efficiency before and after addition of ATP, estimated from the spectra shown in Fig. 2A, was about 70 and 20%, respectively. It should be mentioned that the distance between donor and acceptor could not be estimated precisely from FRET efficiency in our experiments, since steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of Cy3 and Cy5 conjugated with γS3C and ϵ134C was high (>0.36). A high value of the anisotropy means that the mobility of the dye molecules conjugated with F1 is highly restricted, and the estimation of the distance with high reliability is difficult. However, considering that the typical Förester distance (the distance which exhibits 50% FRET efficiency) is around 5 nm (10Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), high (70% efficiency) and low FRET (20%) states presumably represent the “extended” conformation (the distance between cysteine residues is 1∼2 nm) and the “retracted” (8 nm) conformation of the ϵ subunit, respectively (Fig. 1). Since it was difficult to distinguish between “partly extended” (Fig. 1B) and “fully extended” (Fig. 1C) conformations in this study, these two conformations were treated together and were referred as the extended conformation. Time courses of the change of FRET efficiency induced by nucleotides were monitored by the change of the donor fluorescence intensity. As mentioned, 1 mm ATP increased donor fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B, red line). On the contrary, ADP (1 mm) did not cause the change of donor fluorescence (Fig. 2B, blue line). AMPPNP (1 mm), which can bind to F1 but is not hydrolyzed (13Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar), also caused the increase in donor fluorescence, although the change was much slower than the case of ATP (Fig. 2B, light blue line). Therefore, ATP binding but not hydrolysis induces the conformational change from the extended form to the retracted form. ADP + NaN3, which induces and stabilizes so-called “ADP-Mg inhibited state 4ADP-Mg inhibited state: the catalytic turnover of ATP hydrolysis by F1 is interrupted by occasional stable trapping of ADP-Mg at the catalytic site(s). The binding of ATP to the α subunits facilitates the release of ADP-Mg from the affected catalytic sites, thereby recovering the ATP hydrolysis activity. This ADP-Mg inhibited state is different from the product inhibition and is observed for nearly all F1s and ATP synthases from various sources. ” of F1 (14Muneyuki E. Makino M. Kamata H. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Hirata H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and ADP + AlF4-, a transitionstate substrate analogue of ATP hydrolysis (15Braig K. Menz R.I. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar), also increased the donor fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B, green and yellow lines, respectively). Furthermore, GTP also induced the conformational change (Fig. 2C). GTP is a substrate of F1 and supports its rotation (16Noji H. Bald D. Yasuda R. Itoh H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25480-25486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) but has very low affinity to the isolated ϵ subunit (see Fig. 5) (12Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36013-36016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The conformational change of the ϵ subunit was reversible. When added ATP in the medium was rapidly converted into ADP by addition of excess amount of hexokinase (27 units/ml), the change was reverted (Fig. 4B). These results provide direct evidence for nucleotide-dependent reversible conformational rearrangement of the ϵ subunit that was previously suggested from biochemical works (9Suzuki T. Murakami T. Iino R. Suzuki J. Ono S. Shirakihara Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46840-46846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Rates of Recovery from Inhibition and Conformational Change—ATPase activity of F1 from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 is inhibited by the ϵ subunit but the inhibition is relieved slowly by addition of ATP (17Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since it is thought that the extended ϵ subunit has inhibitory effect on ATPase activity of F1 but the retracted ϵ subunit does not (8Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J. Aggeler R. Wilce M.C. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 9Suzuki T. Murakami T. Iino R. Suzuki J. Ono S. Shirakihara Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46840-46846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), recovery of ATPase activity from inhibition should accompany increase of donor fluorescence and we compared their time courses. ATPase activity of F1 is gradually recovered after initiation of the assay by addition of ATP (Fig. 3A) (17Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As ATP concentration increased, recovery occurred more rapidly. Time courses of the recovery could be fitted by a single exponential function assuming transition between the active and inactive states (Fig. 3C, inset, green line). Apparent rate constants estimated from the fitting became larger as ATP concentration increased (Fig. 3D, circles). The increase in donor fluorescence occurred in a time scale similar to ATPase recovery. However, the time courses could be better fitted by a double exponential function with comparable intensities than by a single exponential function (Fig. 3C, red line and green line, respectively). This suggests the presence of multiple pathways or intermediates toward low FRET state. Two (fast and slow) rate constants obtained from the double exponential function increased in a parallel manner as ATP concentrations increased. The fast rate constants showed a good match with the rate constants of recovery of ATPase activity at all ATP concentrations (Fig. 3D, triangles and circles, respectively). However, the lower one was severalfold smaller (Fig. 3D, inverted triangles). Temperature Dependence of Conformational Change—Physiological temperature of thermophilic Bacillus PS3 is about 65 °C, and F1 from this strain exhibits highest ATPase activity around this temperature (18Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7910-7916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next, temperature dependence of the rate of the conformational change of the ϵ subunit was investigated. An increase and decrease in donor fluorescence were induced by addition of ATP (1 mm) and by ATP depletion, respectively. Apparently, changes in both directions were strongly dependent on temperature. To reach a half-maximum fluorescence intensity, it took 95 s (increase) and 1300 s (decrease) at 30 °C, and 7.4 s (increase) and 130 s (decrease) at 45 °C. Time courses for both increase and decrease were better fitted by the double exponential function at all temperatures. Values of four rate constants (fast and slow components for both directions) increased as temperature increased in almost parallel way and the Arrhenius plots were linear in the temperature range from 30 to 45 °C (Fig. 4, C and D). The Arrhenius activation energies ranged from 88 to 126 kJ/mol, and high Arrhenius activation energy is consistent with large conformational change of the ϵ subunit. Although measurement at 65 °C was difficult, since the ATP regenerating system and hexokinase were rapidly inactivated, if we assumed that the linearity of the Arrhrenius plot was still retained at 65 °C, the extrapolated rate constants (faster one out of two rate constants) for the transitions reached to 2.7 s-1 (extended-to-retracted) and 0.18 s-1 (retracted-to-extended). These rates are much slower than that of ATPase turnover (>1000 s-1). Affinity of Nucleotides to the Isolated ϵ Subunit—Our previous study using gel chromatography showed that the isolated ϵ subunit binds ATP with relatively high affinity at 25 °C (the dissociation constant was expected to be lower than 10 μm) (12Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36013-36016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, quantitative estimation of the dissociation constant by gel chromatography was difficult. In this study, we applied fluorescence technique to detect nucleotide binding to the isolated ϵ subunit. When Cy3 was conjugated with ϵ(Q107C), a mutant that has a cysteine residue at the loop between two α-helices of the ϵ subunit, addition of a high concentration of nucleotide caused an increase in the fluorescence intensity of Cy3 several folds, presumably due to the environmental change around the fluorophore induced by nucleotide binding (Fig. 5A). If the change in the fluorescence was plotted against concentration of nucleotide, the plots were well fitted by the function assuming the simple binding reaction (Fig. 5B). The dissociation constants of ATP and ADP to the isolated ϵ subunit at 36 °C, estimated by the fitting, were 1.4 and 130 μm, respectively. The affinity of ATP was about 100 times higher than that of ADP. Affinity of GTP was much lower than that of ATP, and the apparent dissociation constant at 36 °C was 1.8 mm. Note that the value of dissociation constant for GTP is a lower limit, since contaminated ATP in GTP (<0.1% in our sample) could bind to the ϵ subunit and increase the Cy3 fluorescence. Temperature dependence of the affinity between ATP and the isolated ϵ subunit was also investigated. The dissociation constant between ATP and the isolated ϵ subunit increased greatly as temperature increased (Fig. 5C), and the logarithmic plot of dissociation constant against reciprocal temperature showed linear relationship (Fig. 5D). The dissociation constant extrapolated to the physiological temperature (65 °C) was 0.67 mm. Conformational Change of the ϵ Subunit in F1 Is a Slow Process—Although a large conformational change of the ϵ subunit in F1 (and F0F1-ATP synthase) has been suggested from previous structural and biochemical studies (3Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M. Structure (Camb.). 1997; 5: 1219-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 4Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), FRET measurement for the first time enabled us to observe it in real time. FRET measurement showed that even in the presence of a saturating concentrations of ATP, the change from high FRET to low FRET takes >10 s (at 35 °C, Fig. 3D). Thus, the ATP-induced conformational change of the ϵ subunit in F1 is much slower than the catalytic turnover (20Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), suggesting that it cannot be one of obligate steps in each cycle of the catalytic turnover but rather it exerts a switch-like or gear change function of the catalysis. Conformational Change of the ϵ Subunit in F1 Could Occur at the 80 ° Substep Position—As we reported previously, ATP binding to the β subunit induces an 80° rotation of the γ subunit (20Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Subsequently the hydrolysis of ATP and another catalytic event (probably the release of ADP or phosphate) occur in 2 ms at this 80° position (catalytic dwell) (11Shimabukuro K. Yasuda R. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14731-14736Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and the next 40° rotation follows to complete a 120° rotation, a unit rotation driven by single turnover of ATP hydrolysis. Also it was shown that F1 lapses into ADP-Mg inhibited state at the 80° position (21Hirono-Hara Y. Noji H. Nishiura M. Muneyuki E. Hara K.Y. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13649-13654Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We observed that not only ATP, but also AMPPNP, ADP + NaN3 and ADP + AlF4- induced the transition from high FRET to low FRET (Fig. 2B). These nucleotide conditions are thought to mimic the ATP-bound state (13Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar, 22Yasuda R. Masaike T. Adachi K. Noji H. Itoh H. Kinosita Jr., K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9314-9318Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the ADP-inhibited state (14Muneyuki E. Makino M. Kamata H. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Hirata H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the catalytic intermediate (15Braig K. Menz R.I. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar), respectively, and stabilize the 80° position. Therefore, it is likely that transition of α-helices of the ϵ subunit from the extended form to the retracted form can take place when the γ subunit in F1 dwells at the 80° position. Relation between Recovery from Inhibition and Conformational Change of the ϵ Subunit—Recovery of ATPase from the inhibition by the ϵ subunit and FRET change induced by ATP addition occurred in a similar time scale, but their time courses did not agree each other. The real reason of this disagreement is not known. One of possible reasons might be ADP-Mg inhibition. In an attempt to avoid ADP-Mg inhibition, we supplemented a detergent, lauryldodecylamine oxide, to the solution of ATPase assay and FRET measurement and repeated the experiments of Figs. 3 and 4 (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Lauryldodecylamine oxide has been thought to help F1 not to lapse into ADP-Mg inhibition (23Paik S.R. Jault J.M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The FRET change became faster in the presence of lauryldodecylamine oxide, while the time course of recovery of ATPase was almost unchanged 5ATP binding to the isolated ϵ subunit was not affected by lauryldodecylamine oxide (Kd = 1.4 μm at 35 °C). . However, the kinetics of ATPase recovery and FRET change still showed disagreement. We suspect that our F1 preparation could be heterogeneous, and some of the molecules that do not contain the ϵ subunit would be activated from the beginning. We expect that FRET observation at the single molecule level will reveal any heterogeneous population of F1 preparation. ATP Binding to the ϵ Subunit May Stabilize the Folded-hairpin Form—The isolated ϵ subunit of F1 from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 binds ATP (12Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36013-36016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and our recent crystal structure of the ϵ-ATP complex has revealed that ATP binds to the ϵ subunit in a retracted conformation with folded-hairpin helices. 6N. Kajiwara, H. Akutsu, Y. Kato-Yamada, and M. Yoshida, unpublished data. Therefore, we assume that ATP binding to the ϵ subunit may stabilize the folded-hairpin form of the ϵ subunit in F1 to shift the equilibrium from the extended form. In the absence of ATP, the ϵ subunit adopts the extended form in most of time and transient conformational change induced by thermal fluctuation might be rare. A likely scenario is that ATP binding to the β subunits enhances the chance more often for the ϵ subunit with the extended form to make conformational transition to the folded-hairpin form to which another ATP binds subsequently, and the folded-hairpin form is stabilized. Non-catalytic nucleotide binding sites on the α subunits are not involved in this change because their deficient mutant F1(ΔNC) (24Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) also exhibited conformational change by ATP (data not shown) (19Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A model of conformational dynamics of the ϵ subunit at the physiological temperature of thermophilic Bacillus PS3 (65 °C) is shown in Fig. 6. It should be noted that relatively weak ATP binding affinity of the ϵ subunit at the physiological temperature (Kd = 0.67 mm at 65 °C) is suitable to sense the cellular ATP concentration that is in submillimolar to millimolar range. This weak affinity can explain why the ATP binding to the ϵ subunit was detected only for thermophilic Bacillus PS3 but not for other species such as Escherichia coli (12Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36013-36016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). If the ϵ subunit from mesophilic organisms living below 40 °C would have similar weak affinity to ATP, the binding would not be detected by gel chromatography at room temperature. The ϵ Subunit, an Inhibitory or a Coupling Factor?—Even at 0.1 mm ATP, almost all ϵ subunit molecules adopt the retracted form in a couple of min after initiation of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 3B), and an inhibitory effect of the ϵ subunit was observed only for a short period (Fig. 3A). However, the situation may be different for F0F1-ATP synthase (F0F1) working in vivo. In our previous cross-linking experiment, a significant population of the ϵ subunit in F0F1 adopted the fully extended form even in the presence of relatively high concentrations of ATP (for example, ∼40% of the ϵ subunit was in the fully extended form at 1 mm ATP) (9Suzuki T. Murakami T. Iino R. Suzuki J. Ono S. Shirakihara Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46840-46846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The population was further increased by the proton motive force across the membrane. Therefore, compared with F1, the equilibrium of the conformation of the ϵ subunit in F0F1 must be more shifted to the fully extended form in vivo, and the ϵ subunit likely inhibits ATP hydrolysis more effectively. Furthermore, it was shown recently that reconstitution of the ϵ subunit into the α3β3γ subcomplex greatly improved the efficiency of ATP synthesis when F1 was rotated in the ATP synthesis direction with magnetic tweezers (25Rondelez Y. Tresset G. Nakashima T. Kato-Yamada Y. Fujita H. Takeuchi S. Noji H. Nature. 2005; 433: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the ϵ subunit acts not only as an endogenous inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis but also as a coupling factor for the ATP synthesis, as suggested before (26Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although the importance of the ϵ subunit is evident, it is totally unknown how the proton motive force affects the conformation of the ϵ subunit and how the ϵ subunit improves the efficiency of ATP synthesis. Rotational direction of the central stalk consisting of the γϵc10 complex, i.e. the direction of force applied to the ϵ subunit, may affect its conformation and function in non-equilibrium condition. Recent single molecule FRET measurements indicated that there was no conformational change in the N-terminal β-sandwitch part of the ϵ subunit during ATP hydrolysis and synthesis reaction catalyzed by F0F1 from E. coli (27Zimmermann B. Diez M. Zarrabi N. Graber P. Borsch M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The difference in the conformational states and dynamics of the C-terminal α-helices of the ϵ subunit during ATP hydrolysis and synthesis also would be directly probed by the single molecule FRET measurement during the forced rotation of F0F1.

https://openalex.org/W1975179907,"Riboflavin is a water-soluble vitamin (vitamin B2) required for the production of the flavin cofactors FMN and FAD. Mammals are unable to synthesize riboflavin and need a dietary supply of the vitamin. Riboflavin transport proteins operating in the plasma membrane thus have an important role in the absorption of the vitamin. However, their sequences remained elusive, and not a single eukaryotic riboflavin transporter is known to date. Here we used a genetic approach to isolate MCH5, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene with homology to mammalian monocarboxylate transporters, and characterize the protein as a plasma membrane transporter for riboflavin. This conclusion is based on the suppression of riboflavin biosynthetic mutants (rib mutants) by overexpression of MCH5 and by synthetic growth defects caused by deletion of MCH5 in rib mutants. We also show that cellular processes in multiple compartments are affected by deletion of MCH5 and localize the protein to the plasma membrane. Transport experiments in S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells demonstrate that Mch5p is a high affinity transporter (Km = 17 μm) with a pH optimum at pH 7.5. Riboflavin uptake is not inhibited by protonophores, does not require metabolic energy, and operates by a facilitated diffusion mechanism. The expression of MCH5 is regulated by the cellular riboflavin content. This indicates that S. cerevisiae has a mechanism to sense riboflavin and avert riboflavin deficiency by increasing the expression of the plasma membrane transporter MCH5. Moreover, the other members of the MCH gene family appear to have unrelated functions.

Moreover, the other members of the MCH gene family appear to have unrelated functions. The proteins that require FMN or FAD as cofactors are termed flavoproteins. Mostly, they contain noncovalently bound flavin cofactors and are specific for either FAD or FMN. Some of them contain auxiliary groups such as pteridin, heme, iron-sulfur centers, molybdenum, or other metal ions or contain disulfides in their active site. Flavoproteins are involved in a wide range of biochemical reactions. They play a pivotal role in the dehydrogenation of metabolites in one- and two-electron transfer reactions from and to redox centers, in the activation of oxygen for oxidation, and in hydroxylation reactions (1Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The flavin cofactor FMN is produced from riboflavin by the action of riboflavin kinase. FAD derives from FMN and ATP, a reaction catalyzed by FAD synthetase. Riboflavin is a vitamin (vitamin B2) for mammals and many other organisms. Thus, dietary riboflavin has to be taken up from the gut and then provided to every single cell in a multicellular organism. Plasma membrane riboflavin transporters are thought to play an important role in the distribution of riboflavin. However, their existence in many cell types up to now has only been demonstrated biochemically (reviewed in Ref. 2Foraker A.B. Khantwal C.M. Swaan P.W. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2003; 55: 1467-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Whereas passive uptake of riboflavin is commonly observed in riboflavin-sufficient conditions, riboflavin uptake at low concentrations follows saturation kinetics and displays high affinity for the substrate (Km = 1nm to 1 μm (2Foraker A.B. Khantwal C.M. Swaan P.W. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2003; 55: 1467-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)). Riboflavin is not required by most fungal organisms (3Koser S.A. Vitamin Requirements of Bacteria and Yeasts. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, IL1968Google Scholar), indicating that most of them produce riboflavin. Indeed, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is known to be an excellent dietary source of riboflavin (4Bässler K.-H. Golly I. Loew D. Pietrzuk K. Vitamin-Lexikon. 3rd Ed. Urban & Fischer, München, Germany2002Google Scholar) and to possess all enzymes required for riboflavin biosynthesis, which are encoded by the RIB genes (RIB1, RIB2, RIB3, RIB4, RIB5, and RIB7). Some fungal organisms are utilized in commercial riboflavin production processes. One of the best riboflavin producers is the filamentous hemiascomycete Ashbya gossypii that is capable of producing the astonishing amount of 15 g of riboflavin/liter of medium, a concentration at which riboflavin readily crystallizes (5Stahmann K.P. Revuelta J.L. Seulberger H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 53: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Other riboflavin overproducers include mutants of the yeasts Candida famata, Pichia guilliermondii, or engineered Bacillus subtilis strains (5Stahmann K.P. Revuelta J.L. Seulberger H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 53: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 6Sibirny A.A. Nonconventional Yeasts in Biotechnology.in: Wolf K. Springer, Berlin, Germany1996: 255-275Crossref Google Scholar). Despite of being able to synthesize riboflavin, fungal organisms are also able to take up riboflavin from the culture medium. This activity was recently analyzed in an Ashbya gossypii rib5Δ mutant defective in the last step of riboflavin biosynthesis (7Förster C. Revuelta J.L. Kramer R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 55: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Riboflavin uptake was found to be a high affinity (Km = 40 μm) process with low overall activity. The activity was sensitive to competition by FAD and FMN and to inhibition by 2,4-dinitrophenol, an uncoupler of the transmembrane proton gradient (7Förster C. Revuelta J.L. Kramer R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 55: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Riboflavin auxotrophic S. cerevisiae mutants were also found to take up extracellular riboflavin with high affinity (Km = 15 μm) and specificity, but no energy requirement was apparent (8Perl M. Kearney E.B. Singer T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Riboflavin uptake has also been shown in riboflavin requiring mutants of the yeast Pichia guilliermondii (9Sibirnyi A.A. Shavlovskii G.M. Ksheminskaia G.P. Orlovskaia A.G. Biokhimiia. 1977; 42: 1841-1851PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this biochemical evidence, not a single eukaryotic riboflavin transporter is known to date. Here, we used a classical genetic approach and identified Mch5p, a yeast protein with homology to mammalian monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), 3The abbreviations used are: MCTmonocarboxylate transporterORFopen reading frameCPYcarboxypeptidase Y. as the plasma membrane transporter for riboflavin. monocarboxylate transporter open reading frame carboxypeptidase Y. Yeast Strains—Yeast strains were derived from BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) and BY4742 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 (10Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar)). Deletion mutants were obtained from EUROSCARF (Frankfurt/Main, Germany). Haploid rib2Δ, rib3Δ, rib5Δ, and rib7Δ strains were generated by sporulation of heterozygous diploids, followed by tetrad dissection on media containing 200 mg/liter riboflavin. Double mutants were generated by PCR amplification of the rib4Δ::kanMX4 or rib5Δ::kanMX4 alleles from deletion mutants. After ligation of the PCR products into a pUC19 derivative, kanMX4 was exchanged for the Schizosaccharomyces pombe his5+ gene from plasmid pFA6a-HIS3MX6 (11Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). The constructs were excised and used to transform S. cerevisiae cells to histidine prototrophy. A deletion construct for MCH5 was made by ligating a SalI-EcoRI fragment from a library plasmid into pBluescript. The plasmid was cut with BglII, and URA3 was inserted as a BamHI fragment from YDp-U (12Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Next, the mch5Δ::URA3 construct was excised with SalI and EcoRI and used for transformation. In every case, correct deletion was confirmed by PCR. CEN.PK113–13D (MATa ura3–52 MAL2–8c SUC2) and the mch1-mch5Δ deletion mutant in the CEN.PK background (13Makuc J. Paiva S. Schauen M. Kramer R. Andre B. Casal M. Leao C. Boles E. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were a kind gift from Eckhard Boles (Universität Frankfurt/Main, Germany). The rib5Δ::kanMX4 mutant in CEN.PK was made by transformation of a PCR product generated from rib5Δ::kanMX in the BY strain background. The mch5Δ::URA3 mutant was generated as outlined above. The S. pombe strain used for the expression of MCH5 was FY254 (ade6-M210 can1-1 leu1-32 ura4-D18 h– (14Liang D.T. Hodson J.A. Forsburg S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 559-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Media and Growth Conditions—Yeast media were YPD (2% peptone, 2% glucose, 1% yeast extract), SD-Glc (2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB) or SD-Gal (2% galactose, 0.67% YNB). SD media contain 200 μg/liter riboflavin and were supplemented with additional riboflavin to give the desired final concentration. Riboflavin-free media were made from yeast nitrogen base without amino acids without vitamins (Bio 101) and contained all vitamins except riboflavin in standard concentrations. As a rule, only supplements that were required by the strains were added. YADE (2% yeast extract, 0.2% ammonium sulfate, 0.2% glucose, and 3% ethanol) was used for the preparation of mitochondria. S. pombe cells were grown in EMM, a standard synthetic medium for S. pombe, which is devoid of riboflavin (15Mitchison J.M. Methods Cell Physiol. 1970; 4: 131-165Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Suspensions of yeast cells for use in growth assays were prepared in 96-well plates. Serial 10-fold dilutions starting from A600 = 0.6 in adjoining wells were transferred to agar plates using a stainless steel replication device. Growth was recorded after incubation at 30 °C. Plasmids—An S. cerevisiae library in the multicopy vector YEp352 was used (16te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1A, YOR305W was isolated from a complementing library plasmid as BglII/SalI (polylinker site) fragment and ligated into the BamHI/SalI sites of the URA3 2μ plasmid pRS426 (17Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). To isolate YOR306C (MCH5), we used a SalI/EcoRI restriction fragment, which was ligated into the same sites of pRS426. For transport assays in S. cerevisiae, MCH5 was amplified from a complementing library plasmid and cloned downstream of the TDH3 promotor in plasmid p426-TDH (18Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). N-terminal tagging of MCH5 was performed in the low copy plasmid pRS316 by fusing a GAL1 promotor to a 9-Myc tag, followed by the MCH5 ORF lacking the ATG, followed by 224 bp of MCH5 downstream sequence. As assayed by growth of rib4Δ and rib5Δ mutants on low concentrations of riboflavin, both constructs encoded functional versions of Mch5p (data not shown). Reporter assays were performed with cells transformed with a construct containing 832 bp of MCH5 5′-sequences (obtained as a PstI/SphI cut PCR product), which were fused to the E. coli lacZ gene (a SphI/XbaI cut PCR product generated from genomic DNA) in the URA3/CEN plasmid YCplac33 (19Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). To express MCH1, MCH2, MCH3, MCH4, or MCH5 at similar levels in S. cerevisiae, we amplified each ORF from genomic DNA with primers that added restriction sites adjacent to the start and to the stop codon. The PCR products were ligated into pPCR-Skript Amp (Stratagene), sequence-verified, and finally cloned downstream of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promotor of the multicopy vector pYES2 (Invitrogen).

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2955-2956Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), into which MCH5 was cloned as a PCR product. Uptake Experiments—S. cerevisiae rib4Δ for use in uptake experiments were grown overnight in SD media containing 20 mg/liter riboflavin. The cells were washed, suspended in SD lacking riboflavin for A600 = 0.2, and shaken for at least 8 h at 30 °C. S. pombe cells were grown to midlogarithmic phase in EMM. All cells were washed with water, resuspended in 40 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.5, and stored on ice. Uptake experiments were performed at 30 °C in a volume of 500 μl containing five OD cells, 40 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, and 3.2 μm [14C]riboflavin (specific activity 5.54 MBq/mg; a gift of Prof. Dr. Reinhard Krämer, Universität zu Köln, Germany). Aliquots were removed at timed intervals, filtered on glass fiber filters, washed with cold water, and analyzed by scintillation counting. We observed a distinct day-to-day variability in overall riboflavin transport activity in both expression systems, which restricted us to only compare results obtained with the same batch of cells. Additional controls ensured that storage on ice preserved the transport activity of the cells. Glucose uptake was performed as in Ref. 21Bisson L.F. Fraenkel D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MCH5 Shows Genetic Interactions with Riboflavin Biosynthetic Genes—To isolate the S. cerevisiae plasma membrane riboflavin transporter, we first analyzed the growth phenotype of mutants with defects in riboflavin biosynthesis. The rib4Δ and rib5Δ mutants are defective in the penultimate and last step of riboflavin biosynthesis, respectively. When compared with wild-type cells, both mutants showed growth defects on plates containing low concentrations of riboflavin (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, for two enzymes catalyzing consecutive steps in the same biochemical pathway, rib4Δ and rib5Δ cells behaved differently. On minimal plates, rib4Δ cells displayed a milder phenotype and could grow with 2 mg/liter riboflavin. rib5Δ cells, in contrast, required a 10-fold higher concentration of riboflavin for growth (Fig. 1B). Similarly, rib4Δ could grow on complete media (YPD) without added riboflavin, whereas only a supplement of 20 mg/liter of riboflavin allowed growth of rib5Δ (Fig. 1C). The milder phenotype of rib4Δ is probably explained by the fact that the reaction catalyzed by Rib4p proceeds without enzymatic catalysis (27Kis K. Kugelbrey K. Bacher A. J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 2555-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, although both mutants showed a different behavior, both had strong growth defects on low riboflavin plates. Importantly, both appeared to grow normally when their riboflavin requirement was met (Fig. 1, B and C). The strong growth defects of rib4Δ and rib5Δ mutants initiated a genetic screen in which the riboflavin transporter was searched as a multicopy suppressor of the rib mutants. To this end, both mutants were transformed with a multicopy genomic library, followed by plating on media containing 0.2 (rib4Δ) or 2 mg/liter (rib5Δ) riboflavin. Plasmid DNA was isolated from colonies that were able to grow on these media and retransformed into rib4Δ or rib5Δ mutants. Plasmids that allowed growth on plates containing no riboflavin were eliminated because they probably contained the riboflavin biosynthesis genes defective in the mutants. For random samples, this was confirmed by restriction analysis or PCR. The remaining plasmids, 4 of 20,000 tranformants in rib4Δ and 10 of 36,000 transformants in rib5Δ, did not allow growth on riboflavin-free plates and showed partial correction of the growth defects of the mutants. All complementing plasmids contained fragments from the same region of chromosome XV, and the smallest plasmid harbored only two ORFs, YOR305W and YOR306C (Fig. 1A). Only little information is available on YOR305W. The ORF appears to be present in other budding yeast species and cause slow growth when deleted, making it unlikely that it is a spurious ORF (28Christie K.R. Weng S. Balakrishnan R. Costanzo M.C. Dolinski K. Dwight S.S. Engel S.R. Feierbach B. Fisk D.G. Hirschman J.E. Hong E.L. Issel-Tarver L. Nash R. Sethuraman A. Starr B. Theesfeld C.L. Andrada R. Binkley G. Dong Q. Lane C. Schroeder M. Botstein D. Cherry J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D311-D314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YOR306C, in contrast, was previously characterized to be a yeast homolog of mammalian monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs; reviewed in Ref. 29Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) and hence named MCH5 (for monocarboxylate transporter homolog 5 (13Makuc J. Paiva S. Schauen M. Kramer R. Andre B. Casal M. Leao C. Boles E. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)). To analyze which of the two ORFs were responsible for the suppressor activity, we individually subcloned MCH5 and YOR305W from the library plasmid into the multicopy plasmid pRS426 (Fig. 1A). We transformed these plasmids into rib4Δ and rib5Δ mutants and analyzed the riboflavin requirement of the transformed cells (Fig. 1B). Of the two genes present on the library plasmid, only MCH5 was able to suppress the growth phenotype resulting from loss of RIB4 or RIB5 (Fig. 1B). Expression of MCH5, however, did not fully restore growth of rib4Δ and rib5Δ back to wild-type levels. Whereas wild-type growth rates were typical for strains that contained the authentic RIB genes on library plasmids, overexpression of MCH5 did not allow growth in the absence of riboflavin and allowed somewhat slower growth on plates containing 0.2 mg/liter riboflavin (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We also transformed the MCH5 containing plasmid into rib2Δ, rib3Δ, and rib7Δ deletion mutants. Before transformation, these strains behaved like rib5Δ and required 20 mg/liter riboflavin for growth. After transformation with pRS426-MCH5, all of them were able to grow on plates containing 2 mg/liter riboflavin (data not shown). In conclusion, our experiments establish that the suppressor activity identified in the screening is carried by MCH5 and not by YOR305W. Moreover, MCH5 was able to suppress all rib mutants when overexpressed. To analyze the interaction of MCH5 with riboflavin biosynthesis genes in greater detail, we generated mch5Δ rib4Δ and mch5Δ rib5Δ double mutants and analyzed their riboflavin requirements (Fig. 1C). Deletion of MCH5 in a wild-type strain did not lead to a phenotype. In contrast, deletion of MCH5 increased the riboflavin requirements of rib4Δ and rib5Δ (Fig. 1C). Surprisingly, mch5Δ rib4Δ and mch5Δ rib5Δ strains showed identical growth on YPD plates containing 20 mg/liter riboflavin (Fig. 1C), whereas of the corresponding single rib mutants, rib4Δ showed much better growth. Although the reason for this is not known, this may indicate that the mch5Δ rib4Δ double mutant can perform the chemical reaction that bypasses Rib4p only with reduced efficiency. In conclusion, overexpression of MCH5 rescues the growth defects of rib mutants, whereas their phenotype is exacerbated by deletion of MCH5. The Function of MCH5 Is Unique within the MCH Gene Family—Mch5p is a 521-amino acid protein with 12 hydrophobic regions probably corresponding to 12 transmembrane domains (30Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar). It is a member of a yeast protein family consisting of five members (Mch1p–Mch5p (13Makuc J. Paiva S. Schauen M. Kramer R. Andre B. Casal M. Leao C. Boles E. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)) and is most similar to Mch4p with which it shares 45% identical amino acids (31Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the MCH genes, MCH5 appears to have the highest expression level, followed by MCH4 (13Makuc J. Paiva S. Schauen M. Kramer R. Andre B. Casal M. Leao C. Boles E. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To analyze if the function of MCH5 was shared by any of the other MCH genes, we individually expressed the MCH1, MCH2, MCH3, and MCH4 ORFs in rib5Δ. To achieve similar levels of expression, all ORFs were amplified from genomic DNA and cloned downstream of the GAL1 promotor in the multicopy plasmid pYES2. Analysis of the transformants revealed that only MCH5 allowed growth of rib5Δ cells on low riboflavin concentrations (Fig. 1D). Moreover, suppression by MCH5 was not seen on glucose-containing plates, indicating that expression of MCH5 was necessary for its activity as a multicopy suppressor (Fig. 1D). We also deleted RIB5 in individual strains carrying null alleles of MCH1, MCH2, MCH3, MCH4, or MCH5 and found synthetic defects only for the combined deletion of MCH5 and RIB5 (data not shown). These findings were corroborated by growth assays performed with a strain deleted for all five MCH genes (13Makuc J. Paiva S. Schauen M. Kramer R. Andre B. Casal M. Leao C. Boles E. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because this strain was from the CEN.PK background, we generated a series of isogenic strains deleted for RIB5, RIB5 and MCH5, or RIB5 and all MCH genes and used them in growth assays (Fig. 1E). We found that mch1–5Δ showed wild-type growth, but growth was affected by deletion of RIB5. As expected from our findings in the BY strain background (Fig. 1C), deletion of MCH5 further reduced the growth of rib5Δ. Importantly, a strain deleted for all MCH genes and for RIB5 showed no growth defects beyond the defects seen in mch5Δ rib5Δ (Fig. 1E). This demonstrates that MCH5 performs a unique function within the yeast MCH gene family. This function, however, appears to be different from the human monocarboxylate transporters. Whereas the human proteins act as transporters for pyruvate, lactate, ketone bodies, and other monocarboxylates (29Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), these substances were ruled out as possible substrates of the yeast Mch proteins (13Makuc J. Paiva S. Schauen M. Kramer R. Andre B. Casal M. Leao C. Boles E. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1131-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ribΔ Strains Develop Extragenic Suppressor Mutations—In the course of our experiments, we noted that strains with ribΔ mutations frequently segregated colonies that display improved growth (see Figs. 1, C and D). This behavior has been observed by others for rib4Δ and was interpreted to be due to the appearance of extragenic supressors (32Lesuisse E. Knight S.A. Courel M. Santos R. Camadro J.M. Dancis A. Genetics. 2005; 169: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Initially, we identified suppressor mutants only in rib4Δ, but this finding was likely influenced by the higher riboflavin content of rib4Δ, relative to the other ribΔ mutants. Closer investigation of this phenomenon provided evidence that colonies with improved growth characteristics arise at similar frequencies in all riboflavin biosynthetic mutants tested. 4A. Spitzner, P. Reihl, and J. Stolz, unpublished observations. Whereas this high frequency of spontaneous mutations in ribΔ mutants is probably explained by the involvement of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway in the detoxification of 8-oxo-GTP, a spontaneously produced mutagenic substrate for DNA synthesis (33Kobayashi M. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Kaneko M. Hayakawa H. Sekiguchi M. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26394-26399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 34Boretsky Y.R. Kapustyak K.Y.

FEMS Yeast Res. 2005; 5: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism by which the suppressor mutations improve growth is currently unknown. Suppressor mutations also arise in ribΔ mch5Δ strains, indicating that suppression is not caused by a mutation in MCH5 (Fig. 1C). Due to this phenomenon, the strains used for the analyses described below were taken from plates that were free of suppressors and their growth in liquid media was limited to the minimal time required to perform the experiment. Moreover, we carefully monitored the growth rates to exclude cultures that grew faster then expected from further analysis. A detailed analysis of the suppressor mutants will be presented elsewhere. Deletion of MCH5 Causes Inactivation of FAD-dependent Processes—To assess the consequences caused by inactivation of RIB5 and MCH5, we determined the activity of FAD dependent processes located in different cellular compartments. It has been demonstrated before that the formation of disulfide bonds in proteins depends on riboflavin biosynthesis (23Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and is catalyzed by the FAD-dependent oxidase Ero1p localized in the ER lumen (35Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 36Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 983-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). A reduced capability to oxidize protein thiols results in the ER retention of disulfide-containing proteins after treatment of cells with reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (23Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). CPY, a vacuolar protease containing five disulfides, is a convenient marker to monitor protein oxidation, because disulfide formation is required for the folding and ER export and because its electrophoretic mobility reflects its cellular localization (23Tu B.P. Ho-Schleyer S.C. Travers K.J. Weissman J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 35Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol.

Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments revealed that wild-type cells matured CPY very quickly (Fig. 2A). Although the CPY precursors (p1, corresponding to the ER form, and p2, corresponding to the Golgi form) were more abundant, the vacuolar (m) form of CPY could already be detected 10 min after dithiothreitol removal. Precursors were only present in trace amounts at later time points, where the mature form accumulated as expected (Fig. 2A). rib5Δ mutants showed a slower maturation of CPY. After a 10-min chase, no mature CPY was present and only p1 and p2 forms were observed. In rib5Δ, precursor and mature forms showed roughly equal abundance after a 30-min chase, whereas at 60 min and later, mCPY was the dominant form, and precursors had a lower abundance. Maturation of CPY was further slowed in rib5Δ mch5Δ double mutants where mature forms appeared only after a 60-min chase. It was also evident from Fig. 2A that rib5Δ mch5Δ do not produce the p2 form of CPY. This can be explained by assuming tha"
https://openalex.org/W2030375267,"An increasing number of diseases have been mapped to genes coding for ion channel proteins, including the gap junction proteins, connexins. Here, we report on the identification of an amino acid sequence underlying the behavior of a non-functional mutant connexin46 (CX46) associated with congenital cataracts. The mutant protein, CX46fs380, is 31 amino acids longer than CX46 and contains 87 aberrant amino acids in its C terminus. When expressed in mammalian cells, the mutant CX46 was not found at gap junctional plaques, but it showed extensive co-localization with markers for ERGIC and Golgi. The severe reductions in function and formation of gap junctional plaques were transferred to other connexins by creating chimeras containing the last third (or more) of the aberrant C terminus of the CX46 mutant. This sequence also impaired trafficking of a CD8 chimera. Site-directed mutagenesis of a diphenylalanine restored appositional membrane localization and function. These results suggest a novel mechanism in which a mutation causes disease by generating a motif that leads to retention within the synthetic/secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2028538270,"Host genes involved in lipid metabolism are differentially regulated during the early stages of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The majority of lipids synthesized in the liver are exported to other tissues in the form of lipoproteins. The formation of these lipoproteins is dependent upon the association of triglycerides with apolipoprotein B100. Using the HCV subgenomic replicon expression system, we show that secretion of apoB100 is significantly reduced. Inhibition of apoB100 degradation by ALLN did not improve secretion. Triglyceride levels as well as microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mRNA and activity levels were reduced in replicon-expressing cells, indicating potential reasons for the observed decrease. Further evidence is presented for the interaction between the HCV nonstructural protein 5A and apoB100. These results provide further insight into the alteration of lipid metabolism by HCV."
https://openalex.org/W2002940566,"We recently demonstrated that the activation of ceramide kinase (CERK) and the formation of its product, ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), are necessary for the degranulation pathway in mast cells and that the kinase activity of this enzyme is completely dependent on the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ (Mitsutake, S., Kim, T.-J., Inagaki, Y., Kato, M., Yamashita, T., and Igarashi, Y. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 17570-17577). Despite the demonstrated importance of Ca2+ as a regulator of CERK activity, there are no apparent binding domains in the enzyme and the regulatory mechanism has not been well understood. In the present study, we found that calmodulin (CaM) is involved in the Ca2+-dependent activation of CERK. The CaM antagonist W-7 decreased both CERK activity and intracellular C1P formation. Additionally, exogenously added CaM enhanced CERK activity even at low concentrations of Ca2+. The CERK protein was co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-CaM antibody, indicating formation of intracellular CaM·CERK complexes. An in vitro CaM binding assay also demonstrated Ca2+-dependent binding of CaM to CERK. These results strongly suggest that CaM acts as a Ca2+ sensor for CERK. Furthermore, a CaM binding assay using various mutants of CERK revealed that the binding site of CERK is located within amino acids 422-435. This region appears to include a type 1-8-14B CaM binding motif and is predicted to form an amphipathic helical wheel, which is utilized in CaM recognition. The expression of a deletion mutant of CERK that contained the CaM binding domain but lost CERK activity inhibited the Ca2+-dependent C1P formation. These results suggest that this domain could saturate the CaM and hence block Ca2+-dependent activation of CERK. Finally, we reveal that in mast cell degranulation CERK acts downstream of CaM, similar to CaM-dependent protein kinase II, which had been assumed to be the main target of CaM in mast cells. We recently demonstrated that the activation of ceramide kinase (CERK) and the formation of its product, ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), are necessary for the degranulation pathway in mast cells and that the kinase activity of this enzyme is completely dependent on the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ (Mitsutake, S., Kim, T.-J., Inagaki, Y., Kato, M., Yamashita, T., and Igarashi, Y.

Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Many stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor α, Fas ligand, γ-irradiation, anti-tumor reagents, and heat shock, cause an elevation in intracellular Cer content following the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by endogenous sphingomyelinase. These changes can result in cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (5Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A.

Cer is converted to sphingosine through the action of ceramidase, and in turn the sphingosine is metabolized to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) by sphingosine kinase. S1P has been found to regulate cell growth (7Oliver A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) and motility (8Kupperman E. An S. Osborne N. Waldron S.

The Cer/sphingosine/S1P pathway had been considered to be the major metabolic pathway of Cer. However, in 2002, the enzyme ceramide kinase (CERK), which metabolizes Cer to ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), was cloned (11Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel. S. Kohama, T. J.

CERK activity was initially described as a Ca2+-stimulated lipid kinase activity that was co-purified with brain synaptic vesicles (12Bajjalieh S.M. Martin T.F. Floor E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14354-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it has since been reported in HL60 cells (13Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol.

In both arachidonic acid release and mast cell degranulation, the intracellular elevation of Ca2+ is a crucial event that acts as a regulatory mechanism of CERK activity. However, there are no apparent Ca2+ binding domains in the primary structure of CERK (such as an EF-hand or C2 domain), and the Ca2+ regulatory mechanism has not been well understood. Calmodulin (CaM) has been recognized as a calcium sensor that interacts with and regulates multiple protein targets (21Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). When intracellular Ca2+ levels rise, four Ca2+ ions bind to CaM and the Ca2+·CaM complex binds to the target protein, initiating various signaling cascades. In this manner, CaM is known to regulate ion channels, cell cycle, and cytoskeletal organization and to influence development (22Heuman R.G. Arkinson R.C. Andruss B.F. Bolduc C. Kovalick G.E. Backingham K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2420-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In the work presented here, we investigated the mechanism of the Ca2+-dependent activation of CERK and found that CaM was in fact involved. Utilizing point mutation analysis, we also identified the CaM binding site in CERK. Materials—Ceramide (C18:0, d18:1), cardiolipin, p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl β-d-glucosaminide, A23187, and an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) were all purchased from Sigma. [32P]ATP and [3H]sphingosine were from PerkinElmer and American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), respectively. The calmodulin antagonist W-7 and the calmodulin-dependent kinase II inhibitor KN-93 were from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). An imidoester cross-linker, dimethyl 3,3-dithiobispropionimidate/2HCl, and an anti-CaM antibody were from Pierce and Zymed Laboratories Inc.(South San Francisco, CA), respectively. All reagents were of the highest purity available. CERK Assays—The kinase activity of CERK was assayed as described previously (20Mitsutake S. Kim T.-J. Inagaki Y. Kato M. Yamashita T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17570-17577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer comprising 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm KCl, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Each lysate was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm cardiolipin, 1.5% β-octylglucoside, 0.2 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 20 μm [32P]ATP, and 40 μm Cer (C18:0, d18:1). As indicated, varying amounts of CaCl2, EGTA, and bovine CaM were added to this mixture. In certain experiments, lysates were preincubated with an inhibitor, W-7 or KN-93, at the indicated concentration for 10 min, and then the enzyme activity was assayed. Lipids were extracted and separated on Silica Gel 60 high performance TLC (HPTLC) plates (Merck) using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1, v/v) as the solvent system. Bands corresponding to C1P were quantified using an imaging analyzer BAS2500 (Fuji Film). Cell Culture and Metabolic Labeling—Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells and the previously established CERK transfectants RBL-CK3 and CK4 (20Mitsutake S. Kim T.-J. Inagaki Y. Kato M. Yamashita T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17570-17577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) were cultured as monolayers in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were maintained in Ham's nutrient mixture F12 medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Human embryonic kidney 293FT cells were purchased from Invitrogen and cultured according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells were transfected with the indicated DNA using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) for CHO-K1 cells and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for human embryonic kidney 293FT cells, respectively. For metabolic labeling, RBL-CK3 cells (106) were incubated with 2 μCi (2 μl) of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphoric acid (PerkinElmer) in 5 ml of Eagle's minimal essential medium for 90 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, the cells were harvested and washed twice with Tyrode's buffer (25 mm PIPES (pH 7.2), 119 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). As indicated, W-7 was added to the Tyrode's buffer, and cells were preincubated for 10 min. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated at 37 °C with 0.1 μm A23187, a calcium ionophore, for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by adding 7 volumes of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Two phases were generated by adding 1.6 volumes of 1 m KCl. The organic phase was dried and subjected to a mild alkaline treatment to remove glycerophospholipids, as described elsewhere (13Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14917-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were re-extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41844) Google Scholar). [32P]C1P was separated on HPTLC and imaged as above for the CERK assay. Plasmid Construction—Murine CERK was cloned into a pcDNA3-FLAG vector as described previously (20Mitsutake S. Kim T.-J. Inagaki Y. Kato M. Yamashita T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17570-17577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The following primers were used to amplify deletion mutants of CERK: for dC450, 5′-TCCAGTGTGGTGGAATTCTTA-3′ and 5′-AACGAAAGTGAAGTCGAACTGGT-3′; for dC330, 5′-TCCAGTGTGGTGGAATTCTTA-3′ and 5′-GGACAGTGTCCCTTCATAGTAC-3′; and for dN330, 5′-TCCTTCCTCCCAGCACAGCACAC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTT-3′. The PCR was carried out with Pfu-Turbo (Stratagene) by using murine CERK as a template. After smoothing the 5′- and 3′-ends with T4 polymerase (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan), the products were purified and ligated with T4 ligase (Takara) in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara) as described elsewhere (25Imai Y. Matsushima Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 25: 2785Crossref Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions. The following primers were used to construct point mutants: for dN330L422R, 5′-CTTCTGACCTCATCCGTATCCGGAA-3′ and 5′-TTCCGGATACGGATGAGGTCAGAAG-3′; for dN330F429R, 5′-GTGCTCCAGGCTCAACTTCCTGAGA-3′ and 5′-TCTCAGGAAGTTGAGCCTGGAGCAC-3′; for dN330F431R and FL-F431R, 5′-GTGCTCCAGGTTCAACCTCCTGAGA-3′ and 5′-TCTCAGGAGGTTGAACCTGGAGCAC-3′; and for dN330L435R, 5′-CTTCCTGAGATTTCGCATCCGGCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGCCGGATGCGAAATCTCAGGAAG-3′. The mutant dN330 was used as the template in PCR reactions for dN330L422R, dN330F429R, dN330F431R, and dN330L435R, and murine CERK was used for FL-F431R. For the double mutant (dN330L422R/F429R), dN330L422R was used as a template. Immunochemical Studies—For immunoprecipitations, harvested cells were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation at 15 × 103 rpm for 5 min, primary antibodies were added to the supernatants, and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Antibody complexes were precipitated by incubating for 3 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) in IP buffer. Prior to their use in CERK assay, the beads were pelleted and washed three times in IP buffer. For CERK assays the beads were repeatedly washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove detergent and other reagents. For use in Western blotting, the beads were taken up in 20 μl of SDS loading buffer containing 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinyldifluoride membrane according to the method described by Towbin et al. (27Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). After a 1-h incubation with 3% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 (T-TBS), the membrane was incubated with antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After a wash with T-TBS, the membrane was incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). After another wash with T-TBS, the membranes were developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer and were then visualized using x-ray film. CaM Affinity Binding Assays—CHO cells overexpressing CERK or CERK mutants were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture). After the lysates were diluted with 4 volumes of dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), they were centrifuged (20,000 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris. The supernatants (50 μl) were added to 50 μl of CaM-Sepharose 4B beads that had been equilibrated with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 2 mm CaCl2 or 4 mm EGTA, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were removed by washing three times with binding buffer. Proteins bound to the CaM-Sepharose beads were then analyzed by Western blotting as described above. The blot was probed with an anti-CERK antibody that had been previously prepared (21Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Degranulation Assays—RBL-2H3, -CK3, or -CK4 cells were harvested and washed with Tyrode's buffer. After a 10-min preincubation in the presence or absence of the indicated concentration of W-7 or KN-93, the cells were stimulated at 37 °C with 0.1 μm A23187 for 30 min. Cells were then centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, and the β-hexosaminidase activity was measured in both the supernatant and cell pellet, using p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl β-d-glucosaminide (Sigma) as a chromogenic substrate (28Yamashita T. Yamaguchi T. Murakami K. Nagasawa S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Degranulation was expressed as a percentage of the β-hexosaminidase activity released into the supernatant. CaM Is Involved in the Ca2+-dependent Activation of CERK and the Ca2+-dependent Formation of C1P—We previously reported that CERK is involved in Ca2+-dependent degranulation in mast cells and that C1P elevation following CERK activation is required for the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ (20Mitsutake S. Kim T.-J. Inagaki Y. Kato M. Yamashita T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17570-17577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This suggests that the activation of CERK by Ca2+ is required for degranulation. Sugiura et al. (11Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel. S. Kohama, T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) previously reported that nanomolar-order concentrations of Ca2+ were sufficient to activate CERK in vitro. However, in our previous studies, immunoprecipitated CERK required micromolar-order concentrations of Ca2+ for activation. The major difference between these two experiments was the source of the enzyme. Sugiura used whole cell lysates from CERK-overexpressing cells, whereas we used the immunoprecipitated enzyme. These facts suggested the presence of a cofactor for CERK that enhances its Ca2+ sensitivity, a cofactor that is lost during the immunoprecipitation. CaM is a well known Ca2+ sensor that modulates the activity of a number of metabolic enzymes (21Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). We investigated whether CaM might be involved in the Ca2+ activation of CERK, initially by examining the effects of the CaM antagonist W-7 on CERK activity in vitro. We used a previously established cell line, RBL-CK3, that stably expresses CERK and displays an activity ∼250 times greater than that of its parent RBL-2H3 cells (20Mitsutake S. Kim T.-J. Inagaki Y. Kato M. Yamashita T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17570-17577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Enzymes were prepared from the RBL-CK3 cells as whole cell lysates (lysate-CERK) or immunoprecipitated CERK. As shown in Fig. 1, W-7 had almost no effect on the activity of the immunoprecipitated CERK, whereas it decreased the CERK activity in the lysate in a dose-dependent manner. W-7 is known to bind to CaM and to inhibit Ca2+/CaM-regulated enzyme activity. It is possible that the immunoprecipitation process might cause the displacement of CaM associated with the CERK, in which case the W-7 would have no effect on the activity. However, in the enzyme assays of the cell lysate, W-7 increasingly excluded the binding of Ca2+ from Ca2+/CaM·CERK complexes, resulting in a dose-dependent decrease in the Ca2+-dependent activation of CERK. Even in excess Ca2+, the presence of W-7·CaM complexes might interfere with the association of CERK and Ca2+. The baseline activity (determined in the absence of CaCl2) of the lysate CERK was actually greater than that of the immunoprecipitated CERK, but it exhibited only moderate activation by exogenous CaCl2 compared with the immunoprecipitated CERK, suggesting that endogenous Ca2+·CaM complexes had already activated the CERK in the lysate to some extent. To further evaluate the possible involvement of CaM in the activation of CERK, purified CaM from bovine brain was added to reaction mixtures of the immunoprecipitated CERK, and CERK assays were performed. Free Ca2+ concentrations were adjusted using a CaCl2/EGTA mixture as calculated by the MAX Chelator program. In the presence of 4 μm CaM and 600 nm Ca2+, the CERK activity increased two and half-fold (Fig. 2A, black bar). This increase was completely blocked by 50 μm W-7 (Fig. 2A, gray bar), indicating that the activation was entirely dependent on CaM. In the absence of Ca2+, CaM and W-7 showed almost no effect. The moderate level of activation seen in the control lacking the added CaM was sensitive to W-7 (Fig. 2A, white and gray bars), suggesting that some CaM might remain in complex with CERK after the immunoprecipitation and might act as a Ca2+ sensor. Next, we examined whether the intracellular C1P formation would be affected by W-7. In a previous report, we showed that C1P formation in RBL-CK3 cells could be induced by the calcium ionophore A23187 (20Mitsutake S. Kim T.-J. Inagaki Y. Kato M. Yamashita T. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17570-17577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, RBL-CK3 cells were preincubated with [32P]orthophospholic acid for 90 min and then stimulated for 30 min with 0.5 μm A23187. W-7 treatment decreased the observed Ca2+-dependent formation of [32P]C1P in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the hypothesis that CaM acts as a calcium sensor for CERK. Ca2+-dependent Association of CERK with CaM—To examine whether the CaM is bound directly to CERK, co-precipitation assays were performed using CaM-Sepharose 4B. Lysates from CHO cells expressing CERK were incubated with CaM-Sepharose 4B in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. CERK was co-precipitated with CaM-Sepharose 4B only in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3A). This result supports the contention that CaM binds to CERK and that this binding is Ca2+-dependent. Next, we examined whether endogenous CaM is also bound to CERK in situ. CERK was overexpressed in CHO cells, and the cells were treated with the cleavable protein-protein cross-linker, dimethyl 3,3-dithiobispropionimidate. CaM was immunoprecipitated using an anti-CaM antibody, the cross-linker was cleaved with 2-mercaptoethanol, and the sample was processed for Western blotting. CERK was co-immunoprecipitated with CaM only when the anti-CaM antibody was added (Fig. 3B, upper panel), yet the CERK levels were the same in both samples (Fig. 3B, lower panel). These experiments demonstrate that exogenous as well as endogenous CaM binds to CERK in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Identification of the CaM Binding Site in CERK—To determine the CaM binding domain in CERK, we prepared a series of truncation mutants of CERK as shown in Fig. 4. Each mutant was expressed in CHO cells, and cell lysates were incubated with CaM-Sepharose in the presence of CaCl2 or EGTA. Full-length CERK (FL) and the dC450 mutant both bound CaM in the presence of Ca2+, whereas dC330 did not. The C-terminal fragment (dN330) was also able to bind CaM. Together, these results indicate that CaM binding to CERK is restricted to the C-terminal region between residues 330-450. Most CaM targets contain one of two types of recognition motifs, a Ca2+-independent IQ motif or one of the Ca2+-dependent motifs 1-5-10 or 1-8-14 or its variants (21Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Types 1-5-10 and 1-8-14 motifs are defined by amphipathic helices with a net positive charge, in which hydrophobic residues occur preferentially at positions 1-5-10 or 1-8-14. According to searches using the Calmodulin Target Data base (calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb/ctdb/home.html), there are several candidates for a CaM binding site present in CERK. Particularly, residues 422-435, which were also present in dN330 fragment, showed characteristics of a type 1-8-14B CaM binding motif. The motif corresponding to 1-8-14B is composed of the sequence (FILVW)XXXXXX(FAILVW)XXXXX(FILVW), with a net charge of +2 to +4. The hydrophobic amino acids Leu-422, Phe-429, and Leu-435 correspond to the 1st, 8th, and 14th amino acids, respectively (Fig. 4B, asterisks), and the net charge of this region is +4. As shown in Fig. 4B, residues 422-435 of mouse CERK are conserved in human, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans, especially in their hydrophobic nature. To determine whether these residues were involved in CaM binding, we replaced Leu-422, Phe-429, Phe-431, or Leu-435 in the dN330 fragment of CERK with Arg, to disrupt the hydrophobicity. These mutants were expressed and CaM binding assays were performed. Wild type CERK, dN330, and dN330F422R showed similar Ca2+-dependent CaM binding (Fig. 5A), whereas the dN330F429R mutant displayed only weak binding. Neither dN330F431R nor dN330F435R had any binding activity to CaM (Fig. 5A). Regions formed by basic or hydrophobic amino acids are apparent in helical wheel models of many CaM-binding proteins. The helical wheel projection of residues 420-437 of CERK is shown in Fig. 5B. The arrow indicates the hydrophobic moment. The right side of the wheel contains predominantly hydrophobic (white circles) and basic (gray circles) amino acids. In contrast, hydrophilic amino acids (black circles) includ-ing Cys-426, Asn-430, and Ser-427 are located in the left side of the wheel. The region from residues 420-437 in CERK forms an amphipathic helix that fits the model of a putative CaM binding site. From the results of the binding assays, the hydrophobic natures of Phe-431 and Leu-435 appear to be important for CaM recognition, whereas amino acids Leu-422 and Phe-429, on the opposite side, seem to play a lesser role. As indicated by the hydrophobic moment, the hydrophobic amino acid in the upper right side of the wheel would appear to be important for the formation of the hydrophobic domain recognized by CaM. However, the double mutation for L422R and F429R diminished CaM binding activity of CERK, indicating that although these amino acids might not be important for CaM recognition, they are important for maintaining the helical structure of the CaM binding site. We also generated the F431R mutation, which had the most significant impact on the CaM binding of the full-length CERK (Fig. 5A). The CaM binding activity of this mutant was greatly reduced compared with that of wild type CERK (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, the activities of F431R and"

However, unwanted clot formation can lead to death and debilitation due to vascular occlusion, and hence, anticoagulants are important for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of two synergistically acting anticoagulant proteins, hemextins A and B, from the venom of Hemachatus haemachatus (African Ringhals cobra). N-terminal sequences and CD spectra of the native proteins indicate that these proteins belong to the three-finger toxin family. Hemextin A (but not hemextin B) exhibits mild anticoagulant activity. However, hemextin B forms a complex (hemextin AB complex) with hemextin A and synergistically enhances its anticoagulant potency. Prothrombin time assay showed that these two proteins form a 1:1 complex. Complex formation was supported by size-exclusion chromatography. Using a “dissection approach,” we determined that hemextin A and the hemextin AB complex prolong clotting by inhibiting TF·FVIIa activity. The site of anticoagulant effects was supported by their inhibitory effect on the reconstituted TF·FVIIa complex. Furthermore, we demonstrated their specificity of inhibition by studying their effects on 12 serine proteases; the hemextin AB complex potently inhibited the amidolytic activity of FVIIa in the presence and absence of soluble TF. Kinetic studies showed that the hemextin AB complex is a noncompetitive inhibitor of soluble TF·FVIIa amidolytic activity, with a Ki of 50 nm. Isothermal titration calorimetric studies showed that the hemextin AB complex binds directly to FVIIa with a binding constant of 1.62 × 105 m–1. The hemextin AB complex is the first reported natural inhibitor of FVIIa that does not require a scaffold to mediate its inhibitory activity. Molecular interactions of the hemextin AB complex with FVIIa/TF·FVIIa will provide a new paradigm in the search for anticoagulants that inhibit the initiation of blood coagulation.

Blood coagulation is an innate response to vascular injury that results from a series of amplified reactions in which zymogens of serine proteases circulating in the plasma are sequentially activated by limited proteolysis, leading to the formation of blood clot, thereby preventing the loss of blood (1Davie E.W.

In association with its cofactor FVa, FXa performs a proteolytic cleavage of prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin, promoting the formation of a fibrin clot, and activates platelets for inclusion in the clot. The TF·FVIIa complex can also activate FIX to FIXa, thus helping in the propagation of the coagulation cascade through the intrinsic pathway. The coagulation cascade is under tight regulation. Any imbalance in its regulation could lead to either unclottable blood, resulting in excessive bleeding during injuries, or unwanted clot formation, resulting in death and debilitation due to vascular occlusion with the consequence of myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, or venous thrombosis (3Mann K.G. Butenas S. Brummel K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).

Anticoagulants are pivotal for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders, and ∼0.7% of the western population receives oral anticoagulant treatment (7Gustafsson D. Bylund R.

Coumarins and heparin are the most well known clinically used anticoagulants. Coumarins inhibit the activity of all vitamin K-dependent proteins, including procoagulants (thrombin, FXa, FIXa, and FVIIa) and anticoagulants (activated protein C and protein S), whereas heparin mediates its anticoagulant activity by enhancing the inhibition of thrombin and FXa by antithrombin III (8Hirsh J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 9Hirsh J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The nonspecific mode of action of these anticoagulants accounts for their therapeutic limitations in maintaining a balance between thrombosis and hemostasis (10Hirsh J. Weitz J.I. Lancet. 1999; 353: 1431-1436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These limitations have provided the impetus for the development of new anticoagulants that target specific coagulation enzymes or a particular step in the clotting process (11Moll S. Roberts H.R. Semin. Hematol. 2002; 39: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 12Hirsh J. Am. Heart J. 2001; 142: S3-S8Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because of its relatively low concentrations in blood (10 nm) and its pivotal role in the initiation of the coagulation cascade (13Morrissey J.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), FVII/FVIIa is an attractive drug target for the development of novel and specific anticoagulant agents. Proteins/toxins from snake venoms have inspired the design and development of a number of therapeutic agents or lead molecules, particularly for cardiovascular diseases (14Markland F.S. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1749-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). For example, a family of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme was developed based on bradykinin-potentiating peptides from South American snake venoms (15Higuchi S. Murayama N. Saguchi K. Ohi H. Fujita Y. Camargo A.C. Ogawa T. Deshimaru M. Ohno M. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 44: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of platelet aggregation, such as eptifibatide and tirofiban, were designed based on disintegrins, a large family of platelet aggregation inhibitors found in viperid and crotalid snake venoms (16O'Shea J.C. Tcheng J.E. Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2002; 3: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Marcinkiewicz C. Curr. Pharm.

Ancrod (extracted from the venom of the Malayan pit viper) reduces blood fibrinogen levels and has been successfully tested in a variety of ischemic conditions, including stroke (22Sherman D.G. Curr. Med. Res. Opin. 2002; 18: s48-s52PubMed Google Scholar). To search for new lead molecules, we and others have been focusing on isolating and characterizing pharmacologically active proteins from snake venoms that affect blood coagulation and platelet aggregation. In this study, we report the purification and characterization of a three-finger toxin that mediates anticoagulant activity from the venom of the elapid snake Hemachatus haemachatus (African Ringhals cobra). Although it has mild anticoagulant activity, its synergistic interaction with the second three-finger toxin enhances its anticoagulant potency. The anticoagulant protein and its complex specifically inhibit the activation of FX by the TF·FVIIa complex by noncompetitively inhibiting the enzymatic activity of FVIIa. This is the first report of a naturally occurring FVIIa inhibitor that does not require a scaffold to mediate its inhibitory activity. Lyophilized H. haemachatus venom was obtained from African Reptiles and Venoms (Gauteng, South Africa). Thromboplastin with calcium (for prothrombin time assays), Russell's viper venom (for Stypven time assays), thrombin reagent (for thrombin time assays), benzamidine hydrochloride, and 4-vinylpyridine were purchased from Sigma. β-Mercaptoethanol was purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). The chromogenic substrates H-d-Ile-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (pNA) dihydrochloride (2HCl) (S-2288), <Glu-Pro-Arg-pNA·HCl (S-2366), H-d-Phe-pipecolyl-Arg-pNA·2HCl (S-2238), H-d-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA·2HCl (S-2302), Z-d-Arg-Gly-Arg-pNA·2HCl (S-2765), <Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA·HCl (S-2444), benzoyl-Ile-Glu(Glu-γ-methoxy)-Gly-Arg-pNA·HCl (S-2222), H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA·2HCl (S-2251), H-d-Val-Leu-Arg-pNA·2HCl (S-2266), and methoxysuccinyl-Arg-Pro-Tyr-pNA·HCl (S-2586) were from Chromogenix AB (Stockholm, Sweden). Spectrozyme® FIXa (H-d-Leu-phenylalanyl-Gly-Arg-pNA·2-AcOH) was obtained from American Diagnostica Inc. (Stamford, CT). All substrates were reconstituted in deionized water prior to use. Recombinant human TF (Innovin) was purchased from Dade Behring (M-arburg, Germany). Human plasma was donated by healthy volunteers. All other chemicals and reagents used were of the highest purity available. Human plasma-derived FVIIa, FX, and FXa were a gift from the Factor VII Group (Kazuhiko Tomokiyo, Yasushi Nakatomi, Teruhisa Nakashima, and Soutatou Gokudan) of KAKETSUKEN and were purified as described (23Nakagaki T. Foster D.C. Berkner K.L. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10819-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Wildgoose P. Kisiel W. Blood. 1989; 73: 1888-1895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human soluble TF (sTF; residues 1–218) was a gift from Dr. Toshiyuki Miyata (National Cardiovascular Center, Suita, Japan), and it was prepared as described (25Stone M.J. Ruf W. Miles D.J. Edgington T.S. Wright P.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Human plasma-derived thrombin, activated protein C, and FIXa were gifts from Hiroshi Kaetsu, Shinji Nakahira, and Takayoshi Hamamoto (KAKETSUKEN), respectively, and prepared as described (23Nakagaki T.

Three cardiotoxins (CM-14, CM-17, and CM-18 from Naja naja atra) were obtained from Dr. Mitsuhiro Ohta (Kobe Pharmaceutical University). Plasma kallikrein and plasmin were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). FXIa and FXIIa were purchased from Haemtech (Essex Junction, VT). Tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase-type plasminogen activator were purchased from American Diagnostica Inc. α-Chymotrypsin and trypsin were obtained from Worthington. H. haemachatus crude venom (100 mg in 1 ml of distilled water) was applied to a Superdex 30 gel-filtration column (1.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and eluted with the same buffer using an ΔKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Individual fractions were assayed for anticoagulant activity using prothrombin time (see below). Fractions with potent anticoagulant activity were pooled and subfractionated on a cation-exchange column using the same chromatography system. The anticoagulant fraction was pooled and loaded onto a UNO S6 column (6-ml column volume; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 1 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions collected were assayed for anticoagulant activity. The anticoagulant peaks obtained from cation-exchange chromatography were applied to a Jupiter C18 column (1 × 25 cm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Individual peaks were collected, lyophilized, examined for anticoagulant activity, and subsequently rechromatographed on a narrow bore PepMap column using a Chromeleon microliquid chromatography system (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA). The homogeneity and mass of the anticoagulant proteins were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences API-300 liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry system. Typically, reverse-phase HPLC fractions were directly used for analysis. Ion spray, orifice, and ring voltages were set at 4600, 50, and 350 V, respectively. Nitrogen was used as a nebulizer and curtain gas. A Shimadzu LC-10AD pump was used for solvent delivery (40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. BioMultiview software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to analyze and deconvolute raw mass spectra. Purified proteins were reduced and pyridylethylated using procedures described previously (28Joseph J.S. Chung M.C. Jeyaseelan K. Kini R.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 621-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins (0.5 mg) were dissolved in 500 μl of denaturant buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.5)). After the addition of 10 μl of β-mercaptoethanol, the mixture was incubated under vacuum for 2 h at 37 °C. 4-Vinylpyridine (50 μl) was added to the mixture and kept at room temperature for 2 h. Pyridylethylated proteins were purified on an analytical Jupiter C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. N-terminal sequencing of the native and S-pyridylethylated proteins was performed by automated Edman degradation using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Model 494 pulsed liquid-phase sequencer (Procise) with an on-line Model 785A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. Far-UV CD spectra (260–190 nm) were recorded using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. All measurements were carried out at room temperature using 0.1-cm path length stoppered cuvettes. The instrument optics was flushed with 30 liters of nitrogen gas/min. The spectra were recorded using a scan speed of 50 nm/min, a resolution of 0.2 nm, and a bandwidth of 2 nm. A total of four scans were recorded and averaged for each spectrum, and the base line was subtracted. The CD spectra of the anticoagulant proteins and their S-pyridylethylated forms were recorded in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Preliminary studies indicated that the active anticoagulant protein interacted with another venom protein, forming a synergistic complex. We reconstituted the complex for various in vitro experiments immediately prior to the experiments by incubating equimolar concentrations of the two proteins (unless mentioned otherwise) at 37 °C for 5 min in 50 mm Tris-buffer (pH 7.4). The anticoagulant activities of H. haemachatus venom and its fractions were determined by four coagulation tests using a BBL Fibrometer. Recalcification Time—The recalcification times were determined according to the method of Langdell et al. (29Langdell R.D. Wagner R.H. Brinkhous K.M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1953; 41: 637-647PubMed Google Scholar). 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4; 100 μl), plasma (100 μl), and various concentrations of venom or its fraction (50 μl) were preincubated for 2 min at 37 °C. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 50 mm CaCl2. Prothrombin Time—The prothrombin times were measured according to the method of Quick (30Quick A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1935; 109: 73-74Google Scholar). 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 100 μl of plasma, and 50 μl of venom or its fractions were preincubated for 2 min at 37 °C. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 150 μl of thromboplastin with calcium reagent. Stypven Time—The Stypven times were measured according to the method of Hougie (31Hougie C. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1956; 98: 570-573Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Plasma (100 μl), 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4; 100 μl), Russell's viper venom (0.01 μg in 100 μl), and individual proteins or the reconstituted complex (50 μl) were preincubated for 2 min at 37 °C. Clotting was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 50 mm CaCl2. Thrombin Time—The thrombin times were determined according to the method of Jim (32Jim R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1957; 50: 45-60PubMed Google Scholar). Individual proteins or the reconstituted complex was incubated with 100 μl of plasma and 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 250 μl. Clotting was initiated by the addition of standard thrombin reagent (0.01 NIH unit in 50 μl). The formation of a complex between anticoagulant proteins was examined by gel-filtration chromatography on a Superdex 30 gel-filtration column (1.6 × 60 cm) using an ΔKTA purifier. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Individual proteins and an equimolar mixture of anticoagulant proteins (native or pyridylethylated) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then loaded onto the column and eluted in the same buffer. Elution was followed at 280 nm. The TF·FVIIa complex was reconstituted by incubating 10 pm FVIIa with 70 pm recombinant human TF (Innovin) in Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4)) for 10 min at 37 °C. FX was added to the mixture to obtain a final concentration of 30 nm. The activation was stopped by the addition 50 μl of stop buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, and 1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4)) to 50-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture after 15 min of incubation. FXa formed was measured by the hydrolysis of 1 mm S-2222 in Buffer A in a microtiter plate reader at 405 nm. The inhibitory effect on extrinsic tenase activity was determined by adding the individual proteins or the anticoagulant complex 15 min prior to FX addition. The selectivity profile of anticoagulant proteins and their complex was examined against 12 serine proteases: procoagulant serine proteases (FIXa, FXa, FXIa, FXIIa, plasma kallikrein, and thrombin), anticoagulant serine protease activated protein C, fibrinolytic serine proteases (urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, and plasmin), and classical serine proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin). Various concentrations of the purified individual proteins or the reconstituted anticoagulant complex were preincubated with each of the enzymes for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of the appropriate chromogenic substrate. In a total volume of 200 μl in the individual wells of the microtiter plate, the final concentrations were as follows: FVIIa (300 nm)/S-2288, sTF·FVIIa (30 nm)/S-2288, FXa (0.75 nm)/S-2765, α-thrombin (0.66 nm)/S-2238, plasmin (2 nm)/S-2251, FIXa (3 μm)/Spectrozyme® FIXa, FXIa (0.34 nm)/S-2366, FXIIa (0.4 nm)/S-2302, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (80 nm)/S-2288, activated protein C (0.34 nm)/S-2366, urokinase/S-2444, plasma kallikrein (0.4 nm)/S-2302, trypsin (2.17 nm)/S-2222, and chymotrypsin (0.4 nm)/S-2586. The kinetic rate of substrate hydrolysis (mOD/min) was measured over 5 min. All studies were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C. The kinetics of hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate S-2288 by sTF·FVIIa was measured prior to examining the inhibitory effects of the individual proteins and the reconstituted anticoagulant complex. Reactions were initiated by the addition of S-2288 (0–5 mm) to the individual wells of a 96-well plate containing FVIIa (30 nm) in complex with sTF (100 nm) in a final volume of 180 μl. Initial reaction velocities were measured as a linear increase in the absorbance at 405 nm over 5 min with a SpectraMax Plus® temperature-controlled microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). The inhibitory potency of the anticoagulant complex was measured over a range of substrate concentrations. Reactions were initiated by the addition of S-2288 to premixed cofactor·enzyme and inhibitor in the wells of a microtiter plate. Reactions with sTF·FVIIa contained 0.025–0.1 μm inhibitor complex and 0–3 mm S-2288. The initial velocities were measured over 5 min under steady-state conditions and were fit by reiterative nonlinear regression to Equation 1, describing a classical noncompetitive inhibitor, to derive the Ki value.1/V=Km/Vmax(1+[I]/Ki)1/[S]+1/Vmax(1+[I]/Ki)(Eq. 1) The interaction of the reconstituted anticoagulant complex with FVIIa was monitored with a VP-ITC titration calorimetric system (MicroCal, LLC, Northampton, MA). The instrument was calibrated using the built-in electrical calibration check. FVIIa (10 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer and 10 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4) in the calorimetric cell was titrated with the reconstituted anticoagulant complex (0.4 mm) dissolved in the same buffer in a 250-μl injection syringe with continual stirring at 300 rpm at 37 °C. All protein solutions were filtered and degassed prior to titration. The first injections presented defects in the base line, and these data were not included in the fitting process. The calorimetric data were processed and fitted to the single set of identical sites model using MicroCal Origin (Version 7.0) data analysis software supplied with the instrument. The total heat content (Q) of the solution (determined relative to zero for the unliganded species) contained in the active cell volume (V0) was calculated according to Equation 2,Q=nMtΔHV02(1+XtnMt+1nKuMt-(1+XtnMt+1nKuMt)2-4XtnMt)(Eq. 2) where K is the binding affinity constant; n is the number of sites; ΔH is the enthalpy of ligand binding; and Mt and Xt are the bulk concentrations of macromolecule and ligand, respectively, for the binding X + M ↔ XM. The change in heat (ΔH) measured between the completions of two consecutive injections is corrected for dilution of the protein and ligand in the cell according to standard Marquardt methods. The free energy change (ΔG) during the interaction was calculated using the relationship ΔG = ΔH–TΔS = –RT ln Ka, where T is the absolute temperature and R is the universal gas constant. Purification of the Anticoagulant Protein—Crude venom of H. haemachatus exhibited potent anticoagulant activity in both recalcification and prothrombin time assays (Fig. 1, A and B). To purify the anticoagulant protein, the crude venom was size-fractionated by gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. 2A). Fractions corresponding to peaks 2 and 3 contained anticoagulant proteins as determined by prothrombin time assays. Peak 2 corresponded to proteins mostly containing phospholipase A2 that have been characterized previously (33Condrea E. Fletcher J.E. Rapuano B.E. Yang C.C. Rosenberg P. Toxicon. 1981; 19: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, this peak had milder anticoagulant activity compared with peak 3 (Fig. 2A, inset), so we focused on isolating the anticoagulant protein from peak 3, which was fractionated further by cation-exchange chromatography on a UNO S6 column (Fig. 2B). Only peak A (labeled Hemextin A) exhibited mild anticoagulant activity. During our preliminary studies, we found that the anticoagulant activity of peak A was potentiated by peak B (labeled Hemextin B; see below). Because this anticoagulant complex specifically inhibited the extrinsic tenase complex (described below), we named it the hemextin AB complex (Hemachatus extrinsic tenase inhibitor) and the individual proteins hemextins A and B, respectively. Fractions corresponding to both hemextins A and B were pooled separately and purified by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 2, C and D) and capillary liquid chromatography (Fig. 2, E and F). The homogeneity and mass of the individual proteins were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The mass spectra of hemextins A and B showed three peaks with mass/charge ratios ranging from 3 to 6 charges (data not shown) and their calculated molecular masses as 6835.00 ± 0.52 and 6792.56 ± 0.32 Da, respectively (Fig. 2, G and H).FIGURE 2Purification of hemextins A and B.

The locations of the cysteine residues in the proteins were confirmed by sequencing the pyridylethylated proteins. Both proteins show similarity to cardiotoxins, postsynaptic neurotoxins, fasciculin, and other members of the three-finger toxin family (Fig. 3A), but not to serine protease inhibitors isolated from snake venoms (34Chen C.

It is an inner nuclear membrane protein and phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. However, the means of phosphorylation of emerin are poorly understood. We investigated the regulation mechanism for the binding of emerin to chromatin, focusing on its cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation in a Xenopus egg cell-free system. It was shown that emerin dissociates from chromatin depending on mitotic phosphorylation of the former, and this plays a critical role in the dissociation of emerin from barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF). Then, we analyzed the mitotic phosphorylation sites of emerin. Emerin was strongly phosphorylated in an M-phase Xenopus egg cell-free system, and five phosphorylated sites, Ser49, Ser66, Thr67, Ser120, and Ser175, were identified on analysis of chymotryptic and tryptic emerin peptides using a phosphopeptide-concentrating system coupled with a Titansphere column, which specifically binds phosphopeptides, and tandem mass spectrometry sequencing. An in vitro binding assay involving an emerin S175A point mutant protein suggested that phosphorylation at Ser175 regulates the dissociation of emerin from BAF.

These changes of NE are crucial for cell cycle progression. The NE consists of an outer nuclear membrane, inner nuclear membrane, nuclear pore complex, and nuclear lamina. The inner nuclear membrane contains integral membrane proteins, i.e. lamin B receptor (LBR), lamina-associated polypeptide-2β (LAP2β), emerin, MAN1, and others, which interact with DNA and/or chromatin, and these proteins are proposed to participate in nuclear membrane targeting to chromatin at an early stage of nuclear assembly (1Gant T.M.

Phosphorylation of these inner nuclear proteins, therefore, is likely to be one of the key mechanisms that control the interactions between the inner nuclear proteins and components of the nuclear lamina as well as chromatin. In this study, we focused on the mitotic phosphorylation of emerin, one of the inner nuclear membrane proteins. nuclear envelope glutathione S-transferase GST-fused fragment comprising amino acid residues 1–213 of human emerin GST-fused fragment comprising amino acid residues 37–213 of human emerin barrier-to-autointegration factor lamina-associated polypeptide lamin B receptor M-phase Xenopus egg cytosol fraction S-phase Xenopus egg cytosol fraction matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry endoplasmic reticulum electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid hydrofluoric acid Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Human emerin is a serine-rich protein exhibiting an apparent mass of 34 kDa on SDS-PAGE (8Bione S. Maestrini E. Rivella S. Mancini M. Regis S. Romeo G. Toniolo D. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) and is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (9Ellis J.A. Craxton M. Yates J.R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 781-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Emerin belongs to the LEM (LAP2β, emerin, MAN1) protein family, whose members have approximately a 40-residue domain named the LEM (10Lin F. Blake D.L. Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L.

These proteins directly bind to barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) (11Furukawa K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2485-2492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lee K.K. Haraguchi T. Lee R.S. Koujin T.

BAF is a DNA-bridging protein with a dimer mass of 20 kDa and is highly conserved in metazoans, and the BAF interactions with both DNA and LEM proteins are critical for nuclear membrane targeting to chromatin and chromatin decondensation during nuclear assembly (14Segura-Totten M. Kowalski A.K. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). At the onset of mitosis, emerin disperses from the NE to the endoplasmic reticular (ER) network, and is re-localized to the surface of the central region of chromatin, called the “core” region, during telophase (15Tsuchiya Y. Hase A. Ogawa M. Yorifuji H. Arahata K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Haraguchi T. Koujin T. Segura-Totten M. Lee K.K. Matsuoka Y. Yoneda Y. Wilson K.L. Hiraoka Y. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4575-4585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An LEM domain deletion mutant of emerin cannot be re-localized to this region, suggesting that the binding of emerin to BAF through the LEM domain is essential for this recruitment (16Haraguchi T. Koujin T. Segura-Totten M. Lee K.K. Matsuoka Y. Yoneda Y. Wilson K.L. Hiraoka Y. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4575-4585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also known that emerin has many binding partners, including transcriptional repressors and intermediate filament proteins (17Bengtsson L. Wilson K.L. Curr. Opin.

Furthermore, a deletion mutant of emerin residues 95–99 (Δ95–99), which causes Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and cannot bind to lamin A, exhibits aberrant cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation forms (9Ellis J.A. Craxton M. Yates J.R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 781-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The study also suggested that the phosphorylation of emerin regulates the binding of emerin to lamin A (9Ellis J.A. Craxton M. Yates J.R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 781-792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested in the cell cycle-dependent regulation of the binding of emerin to chromatin and BAF. We first examined the binding of emerin to chromatin by means of a binding assay involving a GST-fused N-terminal fragment of emerin and chromatin in a Xenopus egg cell-free system. We also analyzed the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation states and sites of emerin. Phosphopeptides derived from emerin treated with a Xenopus egg mitotic cytosol were separated by means of a Titansphere column, and five phosphorylation sites were identified on mass spectrometry. Furthermore, an in vitro binding assay involving an emerin point mutant revealed that Ser175 phosphorylation is responsible for the dissociation of emerin from BAF. Construction of GST-fused Emerin Fragment Proteins and His6 Tag BAF—Cloning of the nucleoplasmic region of human emerin (ΔTM, amino acid residues 1–213) was performed by PCR. PCR was carried out with a human testis cDNA library using the following primers: 5′-CGGGATCCCCATGGACAACTAGCAGAT-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCAGAGCACGGTTTTCAGG-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and then inserted into the pBluescript II SK(–) or pGEX 3X vector (Novagen) at the BamHI site at the 3′ end of GST. To generate a point mutant with the serine at position 175 replaced with alanine (S175A-ΔTM), a GeneTailor mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's procedure. PCR was carried out with pBluescript II SK(–)-emerin ΔTM using the following primers: 5′-CTGTTTCGCCTCCAGGGCCTCCCTGGACC-3′ and 5′-CCTGGAGGCTGAAACAGGGCGGTAGTCGT-3′, followed by verification by DNA sequence analysis. The pBluescript II SK(–)-S175A-ΔTM was digested with BamHI, and the resulting fragment was inserted into the pGEX 5X-3 vector (Novagen) at the BamHI site. To construct the pGEX 3X-emerin ΔLT plasmid, pBluescript II SK(–)-emerin ΔTM was digested with BglII and BamHI, and the resulting fragment was inserted into the pGEX 3X vector using the BamHI site in the vector. The cDNA clone of human BAF (accession no. BC005942) was purchased from Invitrogen. To obtain His tag BAF, the coding region of BAF was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-CGGGATCCCGATGACAACCTCCCAAAAGCA-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCATGCAAGAGCGAGAATCC-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and then inserted into the pET28c vector at the BamHI and EcoRI sites. The DNA sequences of the inserts in plasmid pGEX 3X-emerin ΔTM and pET28c-BAF were confirmed using an ALF DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Xenopus Egg Cytosol Fractions—Xenopus eggs were collected, dejelled, and then lysed to prepare S-phase and M-phase cytosol fractions as described previously (26Kawahire S. Takeuchi M.

Chromatin Binding Assay—Using beads bearing GST-emerin ΔTM or GST-emerin ΔLT, the chromatin binding assay was carried out as previously described (3Takano M. Koyama Y. Ito H. Hoshino S. Onogi H.

When pretreatment of the beads bearing GST-emerin with an Escherichia coli extract containing BAF was necessary, it was carried out as follows. E. coli cells expressing His tag BAF were sonicated vigorously and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. A 50-μl aliquot of the supernatant was reacted with beads bearing GST-emerin ΔTM in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 134 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20 either containing 125 μg/ml DNase or not) at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads thus treated were washed three times with binding buffer and then used for the chromatin binding assay. Typically, Xenopus sperm chromatin, which was demembranated with lysolecithin and subsequently decondensed with heated Xenopus egg cytosol, in 20 μl of extraction buffer (10,000 per μl in 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7), 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), was added to the beads, which were thus treated suspended in 10 μl of extraction buffer. After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min, the binding reaction was stopped by pipetting 15-μl samples onto glass slides spotted with 12 μl of a fixing solution (extraction buffer containing 3% formaldehyde and 6 μg/ml Hoechst dye 33342). The fixed samples were observed by fluorescence microscopy. 100–200 beads were observed for every sample, and “the percentage of beads with bound chromatin” was determined. This value was used as an index of the affinity of beads bearing emerin fragments and chromatin. The values in the figures are indicated after subtraction of a blank value. The blank value (<10%) was determined in each experiment using Sepharose beads with GST-bound instead of GST-emerin fragments. The significance of the pretreatment of beads bearing emerin fragments with various reagents in the chromatin binding assay was evaluated by means of Student's t test (n = 3). In a previous study (28Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we compared this method and an established in vitro binding method involving soluble proteins and chromatin, showing that this bead method gives the same results as the established method. Therefore, we used this method to determine the affinity of protein fragments to chromatin in this study. In Vitro Binding Assay of Emerin and BAF—A supernatant containing His tag BAF was prepared as described above. Beads bearing ∼10 μg of ΔTM or S175A-ΔTM preincubated with Xenopus cytosol or extraction buffer were washed twice with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 134 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20), and then incubated with BAF-expressed E. coli extract at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer. The sample thus obtained was subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. BAF bound to beads was detected with an anti-His tag antibody and chemical luminescence. Emerin phosphorylated with a Xenopus egg cytosol fraction was separated by 10% gel SDS-PAGE, and the emerin band was excised. Phosphorylation of the protein was detected with ProQ diamond stain (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions and a reference (29Wang M. Xiao G.G. Li N. Xie Y. Loo J.A. Nel A.E. Electrophoresis. 2005; 26: 2092-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In Vitro Dissociation Assay of Emerin and BAF—Beads bearing ∼10 μgof ΔTM were pretreated with a supernatant containing His tag BAF as described above. After washing three times, the beads thus treated were again treated with buffer or cell cycle-dependent Xenopus egg cytosol fraction at 23 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. BAF bound to the beads was detected as described above. Phosphorylation Assay of Emerin Fragments with a Xenopus Egg Cytosol Fraction—Approximately 3 μg of GST-fused emerin bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with S-phase and M-phase egg cytosol fractions containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 23 °C for 1 h. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), the beads were supplemented with 2 mm ATP and then incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. The proteins thus treated were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by CBB R-250 staining. After drying the gel, phosphorylation was detected with Fuji x-ray film. The emerin ΔTM bands were excised from the gel and the phosphorylated emerin ΔTM was quantified by scintillation counting. Phosphopeptide Mapping—Approximately 30 μg of emerin ΔTM or ΔLT was phosphorylated as described above, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. The full-length emerin band was excised, soaked in 0.5% poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) K-30 in 100 mm acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C, and then washed extensively with water. The protein was digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 16 h at 37 °C. The released peptides were dried, dissolved in water, and then loaded onto a cellulose TLC plate (Funacell, Funakoshi Co., Tokyo). Electrophoresis, in the first dimension, was performed at pH 8.9 (1% ammonium carbonate) for 20 min at 1000 V, and ascending chromatography, in the second dimension, was performed with a solvent system of 37.5% 1-butanol, 25% pyridine, and 7.5% acetic acid in water (v/v). The dried plate was exposed to Fuji x-ray film. Separation of Phosphopeptides Derived from Emerin ΔTM Treated with Mitotic Cytosol Using a Titansphere Column—This experiment was carried out according to the method of Kuroda et al. (30Kuroda I. Shintani Y. Motokawa M. Abe S. Furuno M. Anal. Sci. 2004; 20: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with some modification. Beads bearing ∼100 μg of GST-fused emerin ΔTM were treated with a Xenopus egg M-phase cytosol fraction as described above except that [γ-32P]ATP was omitted. The beads thus treated were separated by 10% gel SDS-PAGE and visualized by CBB R-250 staining. Emerin ΔTM bands were excised from the gel and then in-gel digested with chymotrypsin or trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C for 16 h. The peptides thus obtained were dried, dissolved in solvent A (Milli Q grade water containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid), and then applied to a Titansphere column (4.0-mm inner diameter × 10-mm column, GL Science Co., Japan) equilibrated with solvent A at the flow rate of 0.1 ml/min for 30 min. Phosphopeptides trapped on the Titansphere column were eluted with solvent C (0.5 m H3PO4·NaOH (pH 8.0)) at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 15 min. The thus eluted phosphopeptides were directly applied to a reversed-phase silica-base CAPCELL PACK C8 column (4.6-mm inner diameter × 150-mm column, Shiseido, Japan), briefly washed with solvent A, and then eluted with a 90-min linear gradient, 0–45%, of solvent B (acetonitrile containing 0.0886% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The phosphopeptides thus isolated were analyzed with an AXIMA-CFR MALDI-TOF MS (Shimadzu Co., Japan) using CHCA as a matrix. Dephosphorylation of Phosphopeptides—Dephosphorylation of phosphopeptides derived from M-phase cytosol-treated emerin ΔTM was carried out according to the method of Kuyama et al. (31Kuyama H. Toda C. Watanabe M. Tanaka K. Nishimura O. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 17: 1493-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The phosphopeptides were dried, dissolved in 40 μl of 46% hydrofluoric acid (HF, Wako, Japan), and then incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h. The peptides thus treated were dried, dissolved in 1 μl of 40% acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and then analyzed with an AXIMA-CFR MALDI-TOF MS. MS/MS Sequencing—Phosphopeptides, which were separated with the Titansphere and C8 columns, were applied to an Inertsil ODS column (0.2-mm inner diameter × 50 mm, GL Science Co., Japan) equilibrated with solvent D (2% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) and then eluted with a 20-min linear gradient, from 5 to 55% of solvent E (98% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) at the flow rate of 1.5 μl/min using a MAGIC 2002 system (Michrome BioResources, Inc.). The phosphopeptides thus eluted were directly introduced to ESI-IT MS, LCQ Deca XP (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA), equipped with a nanospray interface (AMR Inc., Japan) and a metal nanosprayer (GL Science Co.). To obtain sequence information on the eluted phosphopeptides, the mass spectrometer was operated in the ion select mode, where the MS scan was followed by the MS/MS scans of the calculated mass of the phosphopeptide as parent mass. The Binding of Emerin ΔTM to Chromatin—Two kinds of emerin fragments, i.e. emerin ΔTM (residues 1–213) and emerin ΔLT (residues 37–213), fused to GST were expressed in E. coli and used in this study (Fig. 1A). Emerin ΔTM lacks the transmembrane domain, and emerin ΔLT lacks both the transmembrane domain and most of LEM domain. GST-fused emerin ΔTM (ΔTM) and GST-fused emerin ΔLT (ΔLT) were purified from E. coli extract using a GSH-Sepharose bead (Fig. 1B). Western blotting with anti-GST antibody of ΔTM and ΔLT preparations, which were purified by GSH-Sepharose showed that smaller protein bands observed in Fig. 1B (lanes 1 and 2) indicated by asterisk were GST-containing degradation products of ΔTM and ΔLT (data not shown). All experiments in this study were done using beads bearing GST-emerin ΔTM or ΔLT. To determine whether ΔTM interacts with chromatin and its interaction is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, like for some other inner nuclear membrane proteins, i.e. LBR and LAP2β, or not, we performed an in vitro chromatin binding assay. We previously developed this assay method to analyze the binding of inner nuclear membrane proteins to chromatin (28Takano M. Takeuchi M. Ito H. Furukawa K. Sugimoto K. Omata S. Horigome T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When beads bearing ΔTM were preincubated with buffer in the absence of the Xenopus egg cytosol fraction, they bound to chromatin slightly (column 1 in Fig. 2). However, when they were preincubated with a synthetic phase cytosol fraction (SC), the binding of chromatin to beads was stimulated (compare columns 1 and 2 in Fig. 2). Preincubation with a mitotic phase cytosol fraction (MC) did not stimulate the binding (column 3 in Fig. 2). Moreover, the once-stimulated chromatin binding activity of SC-treated beads was suppressed on subsequent incubation with MC (compare columns 2 and 4 in Fig. 2). On the other hand, the once-suppressed chromatin binding activity of MC-treated beads was activated on subsequent incubation with SC (compare columns 3 and 5 in Fig. 2). These results demonstrated that the emerin fragment thus expressed can bind to chromatin, and that the chromatin binding assay method can be used to analyze the cell cycle-dependent binding of emerin to chromatin in vitro. The stimulation of the binding of ΔTM to chromatin on SC treatment seemed to be independent of phosphorylation of ΔTM, because the stimulation was not suppressed on pretreatment of SC with apyrase for ATP depletion or a wide-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor, i.e. staurosporine (compare columns 2, 6, and 7 in Fig. 2). Furthermore, the stimulation of the binding did not occur on SC treatment of the beads bearing GST-emerin ΔLT (compare columns 12 and 13 in Fig. 2). These results indicated that the stimulation might be caused by the binding of the BAF in SC to ΔTM, which is known to mediate the binding of emerin to chromatin, because (i) the stimulation of the binding was not suppressed by kinase inhibitors, (ii) the stimulation was not observed for ΔLT, which lacks the BAF binding domain (mentioned below in more detail), and (iii) Xenopus egg cytosol contains 12 μm BAF (14Segura-Totten M. Kowalski A.K. Craigie R. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). On the other hand, suppression of the binding of SC-treated ΔTM to chromatin on subsequent treatment with MC should be caused by the phosphorylation of emerin, because the suppression was prevented by apyrase or a kinase inhibitor, i.e. staurosporine (columns 8–11 in Fig. 2).FIGURE 2The suppression of the binding of emerin to chromatin is caused by mitotic phosphorylation of emerin. Beads bearing ΔTM (∼6 μg) were used, and the beads for columns 4, 10, and 11 were pretreated with a synthetic-phase cytosol (columns 4, 10, and 11), a mitotic phase cytosol (column 5) or buffer (columns 1–3 and 6–9) at 23°C for 20 min. The beads were subsequently treated with buffer (column 1; Buffer), SC (columns 2 and 5; SC and MC-SC, respectively), MC (columns 3 and 4; MC and SC-MC, respectively), SC pretreated with 8 milliunits of apyrase or 5 μm staurosporine (columns 6 and 7; SC+Apy. and SC+Sta., respectively) or MC pretreated with 8 milliunits of apyrase or 5 μm staurosporine (columns 8–11; MC+Apy., MC+Sta., SC-MC+Apy., and SC-MC+Sta., respectively) at 23 °C for 20 min. The beads thus treated were incubated with 20,000 decondensed sperm chromatin at 4 °C for 10 min, and then observed by fluorescence microscopy after staining of DNA with Hoechst 33342. The “percentage of beads with bound chromatin” values were determined as described under “Materials and Methods” after subtraction of the value for blank GST beads. Beads bearing ΔLT (∼4 μg) treated with buffer (column 12) or SC (column 13) were reacted with chromatin in the same way as for the beads bearing ΔTM. The results are the means ± S.D. for three independent experiments. *, a significant difference from the respective control (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Participation of BAF in the Binding of Emerin ΔTM to Chromatin— To clarify the stimulation mechanism for the binding of ΔTM to chromatin on SC treatment, we examined whether the binding of emerin to chromatin is mediated or not by BAF in our assay system. Beads bearing ΔTM were treated with an E. coli extract containing expressed His tag BAF. The beads thus treated were used for the chromatin-binding assay (Fig. 3). ΔTM treated with the E. coli extract containing His tag BAF (Fig. 3A, lane 2) bound to chromatin, although beads treated with buffer or the blank E. coli extract (Fig. 3A, lane 1 or 3, respectively) could not bind to chromatin. The binding of His tag BAF to the beads bearing ΔTM in this assay system was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-His tag antibody (Fig. 3B). These results clearly show that the binding of beads bearing ΔTM to chromatin is mediated by BAF and also support our idea that the stimulation of the binding of beads bearing ΔTM to chromatin on pretreatment with SC is mediated by the binding of BAF to emerin. M-phase-specific Phosphorylation of Emerin ΔTM Suppressed the Binding to BAF—We examined whether the binding of emerin ΔTM beads to BAF is cell cycle-dependent or not. Beads bearing ΔTM were pretreated with E. coli extract containing His tag BAF to bind His tag BAF to ΔTM.

In these hematopoietic cells, newly synthesized FasL is stored in specialized secretory lysosomes and only delivered to the cell surface upon activation and target cell recognition. FasL contains an 80-amino acid-long cytoplasmic tail, which includes a proline-rich domain as a bona fide Src homology 3 domain-binding site. This proline-rich domain has been implicated in FasL sorting to secretory lysosomes, and it may also be important for reverse signaling via FasL, which has been described to influence T-cell activation. Here we report the identification of the Src homology 3 domain-containing adaptor protein PSTPIP as a FasL-interacting partner, which binds to the proline-rich domain. PSTPIP co-expression leads to an increased intracellular localization of Fas ligand, thereby regulating extracellular availability and cytotoxic activity of the molecule. In addition, we demonstrate recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST by PSTPIP into FasL·PSTPIP·PTP-PEST complexes which may contribute to FasL reverse signaling.

In addition, we demonstrate recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST by PSTPIP into FasL·PSTPIP·PTP-PEST complexes which may contribute to FasL reverse signaling.

Although mainly known for its death-promoting activity, FasL has also been studied in the context of further nonapoptotic functions (1Janssen O. Qian J. Linkermann A. Kabelitz D. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2Linkermann A. Qian J. Janssen O. Biochem.

Such experiments are motivated by the special structure of this type II transmembrane protein. In addition to its hydrophobic transmembrane domain, which anchors the molecule within the plasma membrane, and to its extracellular ectodomain, responsible for binding to its receptor, the FasL protein possesses an 80-aa-long N-terminal intracellular part that is responsible for the transduction of (extracellular) signals into FasL-bearing cells and/or that may fulfill regulatory functions. Such a “reverse signaling” has been described in mouse T-cells, which display an altered proliferative behavior upon triggering of their FasL surface molecules (7Suzuki I. Fink P.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 8Suzuki I. Martin S. Boursalian T.E. Beers C. Fink P.J. J.

Results obtained with mouse Sertoli cells, in which FasL engagement leads to mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, as measured by an increase in Erk phosphorylation, also imply stimulatory FasL reverse signaling (10Ulisse S. Cinque B. Silvano G. Rucci N. Biordi L. Cifone M.G. D'Armiento M. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 916-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The importance of the intracellular domain for FasL function and regulation is underlined by its high homology among different species (7Suzuki I. Fink P.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Watts A.D. Hunt N.H. Wanigasekara Y. Bloomfield G. Wallach D. Roufogalis B.D. Chaudhri G.

Immunol. 1994; 6: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Several signaling motives within the FasL intracellular domain are highly conserved, including a tandem casein kinase I phosphorylation site (aa 17-21 (11Watts A.D. Hunt N.H. Wanigasekara Y. Bloomfield G. Wallach D. Roufogalis B.D. Chaudhri G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2119-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)), a phosphorylatable tyrosine at position 7, a proline-rich region (aa 40-70) with bona fide Src homology 3 (SH3)/WW domain-binding sites (7Suzuki I. Fink P.J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and a potential nuclear localization sequence (aa 69-76). 4V. Kirkin, unpublished data. 4V. Kirkin, unpublished data. These sequence elements are likely to contribute to FasL reverse signaling and regulation, which, however, so far has only been described phenomenologically. No molecular mechanism for such signaling or for any FasL regulation involving the intracellular ligand domain has been identified. Apart from transducing signals into the ligand-expressing cell, the intracellular FasL domain may be involved in other regulatory processes. Interestingly, FasL is not expressed ubiquitously on the surface of hematopoietic cells (e.g. cytotoxic T-cells and NK-cells) but is instead sorted to special organelles, the so-called secretory lysosomes, from where the molecule is delivered to the cell surface upon contact with a target cell (13Blott E.J. Griffiths G.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). This sorting to secretory lysosomes is dependent on the proline-rich region within the intracellular FasL domain (14Blott E.J. Bossi G. Clark R. Zvelebil M. Griffiths G.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2405-2416PubMed Google Scholar), but again no molecular interactors have been identified that regulate lysosomal targeting. We screened a yeast two-hybrid library to isolate proteins that bind to the intracellular FasL domain and are involved in such processes. Here we describe the identification and analysis of the adaptor protein PSTPIP (proline, serine, threonine phosphatase-interacting protein; in this paper the human homolog CD2BP1 is for simplicity called human PSTPIP (hPSTPIP) (15Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Li J. Nishizawa K. An W. Hussey R.E. Lialios F.E. Salgia R. Sunder-Plassmann R. Reinherz E.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7320-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)) as a FasL-interacting protein, which appears to be involved in the regulation of FasL cell surface expression versus intracellular storage. Co-expression of PSTPIP with FasL in nonhematopoietic 293T cells leads to a decline in cell surface FasL, whereas the amount of intracellular FasL is increased. We also show that PSTPIP simultaneously interacts with the phosphatase PTP-PEST to form a ternary complex with FasL, which may be important for the phosphorylation status of PSTPIP and FasL. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK 293T, COS-1, RBL 2H3, and HeLa cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum plus penicillin/streptavidin (Invitrogen). L12.10 mouse thymoma cells were stably transfected with pBabe-mFasL by electroporation and hygromycin selection in RPMI medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptavidin. HEK 293T and COS-1 cells were transfected with 5-10 μg of total plasmid DNA using Fugene reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For transient HeLa and RBL-2H3 cell transfections, 1 × 107 cells were electroporated with 20 μg of plasmid DNA using a Gene Pulser II RF model (Bio-Rad). Antibodies and Reagents—The polyclonal rabbit antiserum against murine PSTPIP was a gift from L. Lasky (Department of Molecular Oncology, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and the polyclonal rabbit antiserum against PTP-PEST from N. Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). Human PSTPIP was detected with rabbit antiserum from Carol Wise (Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children, Sarah M. and Charles E. Seay Center for Musculoskeletal Research, Dallas, TX) or with anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and human PSTPIP lacking the SH3 domain with anti-Myc 9B11 (Cell Signaling). The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma. Cell surface human FasL was stained for fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis with the anti-FasL antibody Nok-1 (Pharmingen), and total hFasL was probed in Western blot analysis with the anti-FasL antibody G-247 (Pharmingen). For immunoprecipitation of mFasL, different antibodies were used: biotinylated Mfl-3 (Pharmingen), H11 (Alexis), Alf2a (Ancell), and 3C82 (Alexis). Phosphotyrosine content of proteins was tested with the anti-Tyr(P) antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in Western blot analysis. The following secondary antibodies were used for FACS analysis and immunostaining for the confocal laser-scanning microscope: anti-mouse IgG + IgM-fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-mouse IgG1-APC (Pharmingen), anti-mouse-Alexa488, anti-rabbit-Alexa546 (both from Molecular Probes, Inc.), and anti-mouse-Alexa546 (MoBiTec). Plasmids and Constructs—Plasmids encoding full-length and deletion mutants (lacking aa 1-39 (Δ1-39) or aa 40-80 (Δ40-80)) of FasL tagged with the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) at the N terminus were obtained from H. Eibel (Clinical Research Unit for Rheumatology, Freiburg, Germany). Full-length murine PSTPIP (mPSTPIP) plasmids were provided by L. Lasky (Department of Molecular Oncology, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Plasmids coding for hPSTPIP were obtained from Carol Wise, and PTP-PEST cDNA was kindly provided by N. Tonks. PTP-PEST was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). To delete the hPSTPIP SH3 domain, PCR was performed using the 5′ hPSTPIP-specific primer 5′-ATCGGATCCATGGCCCAGGAGTACCGG-3′ and the 3′ hPSTPIP-specific primer 5′-ATCGAATTCTCACGCCCGGTACTCCTGGGC-3′. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with BamHI/EcoRI and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV Tag3b containing a cytomegalovirus promoter and a Myc tag (Stratagene), resulting in pCMV CD2BP1 ΔSH3. Two different GFP-FasL constructs were used; hFasL with a N-terminal FLAG tag was cloned and recombined in the Gateway vector pDEST53 (N-terminal GFP fusion; Invitrogen). This construct was used for surface FasL analysis by FACS. hFasL cloned into pEGFP C1 (N-terminal fusion; Clontech) was used for confocal laser-scanning microscopy. hTNFα, hXIAP, and mHMGB1 were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The intracellular domain of mouse Fas ligand (aa 1-80) was cloned into the plasmid pAS2.1 (pAS2.1 mFasL-intra; Clontech) in frame with the Gal binding domain. A murine T-cell lymphoma cDNA library (MATCHMAKER; catalog no. ML4001AE; Clontech) with a diversity of 3 × 106 individual cDNA clones was used. The yeast strain Y-190 (Clontech) was sequentially transformed first with pAS2.1 mFasL-intra and then with the library. Prior to library screening, yeasts were tested for expression of the intracellular FasL domain by Western blot analysis. Yeast cells were plated and incubated on agar plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine for 5-10 days at 30 °C. Altogether, 6.5 × 106 transformed yeast clones were screened for FasL interaction partners. Colonies appearing were restreaked onto histidine-deficient plates and subsequently tested for β-galactosidase activity. The cDNA inserts in the pACT prey vector were isolated from yeast colonies with β-galactosidase activity and sequenced using standard procedures. In Vitro Translation and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down—hFasL, hFasL Δ1-39, hFasL Δ40-80, mPSTPIP, hPSTPIP, and hPSTPIP ΔSH3 were used as templates for in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase and in vitro translation in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). The in vitro translated proteins were employed for GST pull-down assays with GST alone or with GST fusion proteins. In Vitro Binding Assay with GST Fusion Proteins—All GST fusion constructs were subcloned into pGEX-AHK (Amersham Biosciences), resulting in the addition of N-terminal GST tags. GST fusion proteins were expressed in the exponentially growing Escherichia coli BL21C+ bacterial strain (Stratagene) by induction for 3 h with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Roth) at 30 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and the fusion proteins were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma). GST fusion proteins were incubated with the appropriate in vitro translated and [35S]methionine-labeled proteins in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl, and 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride plus 1 freshly added tablet of Protease Inhibitor Mix Mini per 10 ml (Complete; Roche Applied Science) for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, resuspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. The GST pull-down reactions were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Isolation, Purification, and Activation of Mouse T-cells from Spleen—T-lymphocytes were purified from C57Bl/6 mouse spleens with the mouse T-cell enrichment column kit (R&D Systems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/GlutaMax (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptavidin, 1%thou β-mercaptoethanol, and stimulated with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Calbiochem) plus 0.2 μg/ml ionomycin (Sigma) overnight. After 18 h cells were treated with the metalloprotease inhibitor phenanthroline (1.5 mm; Sigma) to prevent shedding of FasL. Activation of FasL by Anti-FasL Antibody—24-Well plates were coated overnight with biotinylated anti-FasL antibody Mfl-3 (2 μg/ml). 5 × 107 L12.10 mFasL or L12.10 wild-type cells were added to the Mfl-3-coated wells for 0, 8, or 15 min. Cells were then lysed and used for immunoprecipitation with biotinylated Mfl-3 antibody (1 μg/ml), followed by streptavidin-agarose. Immunprecipitations and Analysis of Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Transfected 293T or COS cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm EDTA containing one protease inhibitor tablet (Complete; Roche Applied Science) plus 1 mm sodium vanadate. Some cells were pretreated with 0.1 mm pervanadate for 4 h before lysis. Immunoprecipitations were performed in vanadate-containing lysis buffer using 1 μg/ml of appropriate antibodies and prewashed protein G Dynabeads (Dynal) at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer without detergent. The proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.). The membranes were blocked in PBS-T (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 60 min at room temperature. Western blot analysis was performed with 1 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-mPSTPIP, anti-PTP-PEST, anti-FasL G247.4, anti-V5, or anti-Myc 9B11 or 2 μg/ml 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies were incubated with the membrane in blocking buffer for 60 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The polyclonal anti-PSTPIP and anti-PTP-PEST antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS-T with 5% milk. The monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine, 4G10-HRP, was used at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS-T with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The commercial antibodies were diluted according to the manufacturers' recommendations. After incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, signals were detected using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Localization Studies of FasL and PSTPIP Using Confocal Microscopy—293T cells on coverslips were transfected with the appropriate expression constructs and fixed 48 h later with 3% formaldehyde (Roth) in PBS for 10 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were washed twice in PBS plus 3% BSA, incubated with PBS plus 3% BSA for a further 20 min to block nonspecific binding of the antibody, and then stained for 1 h in PBS plus 3% BSA containing 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody M2, 1 μg/ml anti-FasL antibody Nok-1, or a 1:40 dilution of the anti-mPSTPIP rabbit antiserum. After washing twice with PBS plus 3% BSA, cells were incubated for 60 min with a 1:1000 dilution of Alexa488 anti-mouse or Alexa546 anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) in PBS plus 3% BSA. Cells were again washed in PBS plus 3% BSA and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). The samples were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Leica TCS SL). HeLa cells were grown on coverslips for 24 h after transfection. For fixation, they were washed once with PBS, pH 8, treated with 3% paraformaldehyde in PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.5) for 5 min and with 3% paraformaldehyde in borate buffer (100 mm sodium borate, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 11) for 10 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 8, for 15 min, washed three times with PBS-Triton (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 8), and treated twice with NaBH4 in PBS, pH 8 (1 mg/ml), for 10 min to reduce unreacted aldehydes. Cells were washed three times again with PBS-Triton, blocked with PBS plus 0.2% BSA for 1 h, and then incubated with anti-Myc antibody (Cell Signaling) and appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. FACS Analysis—To quantify cell surface FasL expression, 1 × 105 cells were incubated sequentially with the anti-hFasL antibody Nok-1 in PBS plus 3% fetal calf serum (5 μg/ml) and anti-mouse IgG + IgM-fluorescein isothiocyanate or anti-mouse IgG1-APC (2.5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, and analyzed using a FACSCalibur and Cell Quest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Co-culture Killing Assay—0.25 × 106 FasL-transfected 293T effector cells were incubated with 2.5 × 106 Fas-sensitive Jurkat A20 target cells in 2 ml of medium for 2 or 6 h at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stored at 4 °C for at least 12 h. Jurkat cell death was determined by propidium iodide staining and by quantification of cells with hypoploid DNA content (sub-G1) using FACS analysis. Identification of PSTPIP as a FasL-binding Protein in a Yeast Two-hybrid Screen with the Intracellular Portion of mFasL as the Bait—To identify binding partners that interact with the intracellular FasL portion and are involved in FasL localization and/or reverse signaling, we screened a mouse thymoma cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid screen (17Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar) using the mouse intracellular FasL domain as the bait. One of the several clones that we isolated from the 6.5 × 106 transformants screened was the C-terminal part of the proline, serine, threonine phosphatase-interacting protein (PSTPIP) cDNA. PSTPIP was first described as an interaction partner of the phosphatase PTP-HSCF, and its functional role has been linked to the organization of the cytoskeleton (15Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18Wu Y. Spencer S.D. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5765-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The human PSTPIP was identified as a CD2-binding protein, hence its name CD2BP1 (16Li J. Nishizawa K. An W. Hussey R.E. Lialios F.E. Salgia R. Sunder-Plassmann R. Reinherz E.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7320-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Whereas the N terminus of PSTPIP contains an FCH (Fes/CIP-homology) domain and a coiled-coil region for protein interactions, an SH3 domain (binding to proline-rich sequences as found within the intracellular FasL domain) is localized at the PSTPIP C terminus (19Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Quan C. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The PSTPIP deletion mutant isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen codes for aa 130-415 and therefore includes the SH3 domain and parts of the coiled-coil region (aa 123-288 in full-length PSTPIP; see Fig. 1c). PSTPIP Interacts in Vitro with the Proline-rich Region of the Intracellular FasL Domain via Its SH3 Domain—To confirm the binding of PSTPIP to FasL, which we had observed in yeast, we performed GST in vitro pull-down experiments. Full-length hFasL and different FasL deletion mutants were in vitro translated and labeled with [35S]methionine. mPSTPIP was expressed and purified as a GST fusion protein, incubated with the different FasL proteins, and tested for binding by GST pull-down analysis (Fig. 1A). Whereas full-length FasL and a Δ1-39 FasL deletion mutant (which lacks the first N-terminal 39 aa) strongly interacted with PSTPIP, the Δ40-80 deletion mutant (lacking the proline-rich region within the intracellular FasL domain) showed only weak in vitro interaction. Residual binding of this mutant could be explained by the presence of a further SH3-binding site within the cytoplasmic FasL tail between aa 22 and 26. In the reverse experiment, in vitro translated mPSTPIP bound to the intracellular domain of mFasL fused to GST (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate that PSTPIP binds to FasL with its C-terminal SH3 domain, we used an in vitro translated hPSTPIP mutant lacking the SH3 domain (hPSTPIP ΔSH3) in a GST pull-down experiment. Whereas full-length hPSTPIP interacted with the intracellular domain of mFasL, the ΔSH3 mutant did not (see Fig. 1B), confirming binding of PSTPIP to FasL via a classical SH3 domain interaction (Fig. 1C). The data also demonstrate that both human and mouse FasL and PSTPIP proteins bind to each other independently of species origin, a result that is explained by the high homology between the human and murine PSTPIP SH3 sequences (93% on the protein level) and the intracellular FasL domains (76% homology). Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments Confirm Binding of PSTPIP to FasL in Vivo—We used different strategies to detect in vivo PSTPIP/FasL interactions by co-immunoprecipitation. In the first experiments, 293T human embryonic kidney cells were transiently co-transfected with mouse PSTPIP and either with FLAG-tagged mouse or human FasL. Immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody demonstrated co-precipitation and binding of mPSTPIP to both mouse and human FasL (Fig. 2A). In a complementary experiment, we transiently expressed FLAG-tagged mouse PSTPIP in 293-005 cells, which were stably transfected with human FasL. Again, we could show binding of PSTPIP to FasL by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2B). When we used untagged expression constructs, we were able to co-precipitate mouse and human PSTPIP with hFasL from 293T cell lysates using anti-FasL antibody (Fig. 2C). As a control to exclude unspecific binding of any SH3 domain-containing protein to the proline-rich region within the intracellular FasL domain, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment with the p56 Lck kinase. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, mouse Lck could not be co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged mouse FasL, whereas in the same experiment, mPSTPIP was efficiently precipitated together with mFasL. We also tested the same FasL deletion mutants that we had used before in our GST pull-down analysis in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. When we co-overexpressed either full-length, Δ1-39, or Δ40-80 FLAG-FasL together with mPSTPIP in 293T cells, we were able to co-precipitate PSTPIP with full-length FasL and the Δ1-39 FasL mutant, but not with the Δ40-80 FasL version, which lacks the proline-rich region within its intracellular domain (Fig. 2D). In the control, PSTPIP was not co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-HMGB1 or FLAG-TNFα. In some experiments, residual PSTPIP binding with the Δ40-80 FasL mutant was again observed. This may be due to the aforementioned PXXPP sequence motif present between aa 22 and 26 of FasL. We then transfected the Fas receptor-deficient mouse thymoma cell line L12.10 with mouse FasL cDNA. After selection, we used these cells to look for binding of endogenous mPSTPIP to FasL. Because FasL expression was not stable in the L12.10 FasL cells and ceased after some time in culture, we regularly confirmed FasL expression by FACS analysis (data not shown). Before precipitating FasL from the transfected L12.10 FasL cells, we stimulated them for different lengths of time with the biotinylated anti-FasL antibody Mfl-3 to test whether the extent of PSTPIP recruitment by FasL is dependent upon FasL stimulation. Fig. 3A shows that endogenous mPSTPIP could already be co-immunoprecipitated with FasL when the cells had not been pretreated with agonistic anti-FasL antibody. Antibody stimulation of the ligand resulted in further recruitment and co-immunoprecipitation of PSTPIP with FasL, and the strongest interaction was observed after 8 min of FasL stimulation, before recruitment decreased again. This decline could be explained by a general down-regulation of the response shortly after FasL activation, but it could also be due to internalization of the FasL-antibody complex or just to antibody degradation in cell culture. Differences in the PSTPIP/FasL interaction resulting from ligand stimulation were not observed with PSTPIP-transfected 293-005 cells, which express a large amount of exogenous FasL (data not shown). The interaction of endogenous FasL and PSTPIP was also studied in activated primary mouse T-cells. Freshly isolated mouse splenocytes were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin for 18 h and were then used for co-immunoprecipitation experiments with different anti-mFasL antibodies. Up-regulation of both murine FasL and PSTPIP during T-cell activation has been published before (16Li J. Nishizawa K. An W. Hussey R.E. Lialios F.E. Salgia R. Sunder-Plassmann R. Reinherz E.L.

https://openalex.org/W2027553536,"The interaction between 4-1BB ligand (CD137L), a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, and its receptor 4-1BB provides a co-stimulatory signal for T lymphocyte proliferation and survival. However, the structure of 4-1BBL has not been thoroughly investigated, and none of the human recombinant 4-1BBL molecules available have been described as capable of co-stimulating T cells. The present work provides a model of the three-dimensional structure of the tumor necrosis factor homology domain of 4-1BBL and describes the production of a recombinant human soluble 4-1BBL whose originality lies in that it contains the whole extracellular tail preceding the tumor necrosis factor homology domain and an AviTag peptide (AviTag-4-1BBL) allowing enzymatic biotinylation and multimerization via streptavidin. We provide evidence that this chimeric protein exists as a homotrimer, whereas commercial FLAG-tagged 4-1BBL does not. This resulted in a much higher affinity for 4-1BB (1.2 nm) as compared with FLAG-4-1BBL (55.2 nm). We demonstrate that the single extracellular cysteine residue in the tail (Cys-51) could form a disulfide bond, both in our recombinant protein and in physiologically expressed 4-1BBL. The mutation of this cysteine residue exerted no effect on trimerization but increased the dissociation rate of AviTag-4-1BBL from 4-1BB. In its soluble form, AviTag-4-1BBL did not stimulate purified T cells but dramatically inhibited proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. In contrast, a very significant co-stimulatory effect was observed on purified T cells once AviTag-4-1BBL was immobilized onto streptavidin beads. In addition, we show that the cross-linking of two trimeric AviTag-4-1BBL molecules was the minimum step required to elicit significant costimulatory activity.

Its expression on various antigen-presenting cells such as B cells, monocytes, and splenic dendritic cells as well as on T lymphocytes is induced upon stimulation (for review see Ref. 3Vinay D.S. Kwon B.S. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). 4-1BBL interacts with 4-1BB, expressed almost exclusively on T cells following T cell receptor stimulation (4Kwon B.S. Weissman S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1963-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), leading to T cell proliferation and cytokine production. 4-1BB ligation also promotes T cell survival and inhibits apoptosis via the induction of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-XL (5Lee H.W.

Immunol. 2005; 35: 1257-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although CD28/B7 interactions play a key role in the early phases of antigen recognition, 4-1BBL stimulation seems to be implicated at a later stage in the primary immune response and during antigen re-exposure (7Bertram E.M. Dawicki W. Sedgmen B. Bramson J.L. Lynch D.H. Watts T.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Moreover, a report by Melero et al. (8Melero I. Shuford W.W. Newby S.A. Aruffo A. Ledbetter J.A. Hellstrom K.E. Mittler R.S. Chen L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) highlighted the importance of 4-1BB/4-1BBL interactions in anti-tumor immunity by showing that the administration of agonistic anti-4-1BB to the mouse resulted in dramatic tumor regressions, even in weakly immunogenic tumors. Considering the growing interest in studying 4-1BB stimulation in T cell expansion, activation, and survival, it is surprising that only two reports have described the use of recombinant 4-1BBL (9Saoulli K.

In fact, most of the in vitro and in vivo studies have been performed either with a stimulatory anti-4-1BB mAb (8Melero I. Shuford W.W. Newby S.A. Aruffo A. Ledbetter J.A. Hellstrom K.E. Mittler R.S.

In addition, despite different recombinant human 4-1BBLs being commercially available today (Alexis, Chemicon, Ancell), they are poorly characterized from a biochemical point of view, and none of them are described as being able to co-stimulate T lymphocytes. As a result, little evidence has been available to date in the literature concerning the structure of 4-1BBL and its organization necessary to achieve T cell co-stimulation. For this reason, we set out to produce a soluble form of human 4-1BBL to determine its structure, its binding characteristics toward 4-1BB and to evaluate its functional activity. Sequence Alignment and Molecular Modeling—Sequences were obtained from the Swiss-Prot data base. Sequence alignment of selected templates was firstly deduced from a pairwise structure alignment automatically generated by the CE (16Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar) and FSSP (17Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar) programs. The 4-1BBL sequence was then manually aligned with the template multi-alignment according to conserved amino acids and predicted β-strand structure. Homology modeling was performed with the Modeler module of InsightII (18Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar) using the x-ray crystallographic structure of mouse TNFα 2The abbreviations used are: TNFαtumor necrosis factor α;BS3 bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)-suberateWTwild typePEphycoerythrineGSHreduced glutathioneGSSGoxidized glutathioneTHDTNF homology domain., mouse RANKL, human CD40L, and human APO2L (Protein Data Bank codes 2TNF, 1IQA, 1ALY and 1DG6 respectively). Loop refinement of selected models was performed with the refined loop Modeler program. An evaluation of the generated models was performed using the Verify-3D (19Eisenberg D. Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar), ProsaII (20Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar), and Procheck (21Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4285) Google Scholar) programs. Energy minimization was then carried out with the CHARMm module of Insight and CHARMm forcefield (22Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13767) Google Scholar) in a four-step procedure (1, all atoms fixed except hydrogen; 2, backbone fixed; 3, backbone of strand structure fixed; 4, all atoms free) using the 100 steepest descent steps followed by conjugate gradient steps, until a convergence gradient of 0.001 was attained. The energy scores provided by ProsaII and the global compatibility score given by Verify-3D were in accordance with those of the templates. Furthermore, the stereochemical quality of the selected predicted model, as evaluated by Procheck, compares favorably with the template. The Ramachandran plot showed 97.7% residues in allowed regions. The protein molecular surface of the selected model was defined using a solvent probe radius of 1.4 Å and continuum electrostatic calculations were performed with the DELPHI package (23Honig B. Nicholls A. Science. 1995; 268: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar, 24Gilson M.K. Honig B. Proteins. 1988; 4: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) under Insight. The formal charge set was used, with an ionic strength of 0, and the dielectric constants of the protein and the surrounding medium were, respectively, 2 and 80. In addition, the electrostatic potentials were mapped onto cubic grids with a 0.72-Å point spacing. The percentage grid fill was 50% for 4-1BBL (129 × 129 × 129 points/slide), and the boundary potential was full coulombic. Following this, the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation was solved iteratively, and the Engelman-Steitz scale was used to display protein surface hydrophobicity (25Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A.

Production of AviTag-4-1BBL as Inclusion Bodies in Bacteria—The cDNA encoding the whole extracellular domain of 4-1BBL was obtained by reverse transcriptase PCR amplification of T2 hybridoma RNA prepared using TRIzol® (Invitrogen). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using poly(dT) primers and M-MLV RT (200 UI, Invitrogen). The extracytoplasmic domain of 4-1BBL was amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CGGGATCCCTCGCCTGCCCCTGGGCC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATTATTCCGACCTCGGTGA-3′ (MWG-Biotech, France). The AviTag sequence (Avidity) TCCGGCCTGAACGACATCTTCGAGGCTCAGAAAATCGAATGGCACGAA (MSGLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) was ligated to the 5′-end of 4-1BBL cDNA, and the whole construct was inserted into the pET24a production vector (Invitrogen). AviTag-4-1BBL was produced as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain. The AviTag-4-1BBL protein (10 mg) was allowed to refold in 500 ml of folding buffer (0.4 m arginine, 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8, 5 mm GSH, 0.5 mm GSSG, 0.005% Tween 20, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Diagnostics) slowly stirred for 72 h at 4 °C under slow agitation, before concentration on a 10-kDa cut-off membrane (Millipore). Biotinylation was performed using biotin protein ligase (Avidity) in compliance with the manufacturer's instructions. After removal of free biotin on HiPrep desalting, AviTag-4-1BBL was purified by gel filtration on Superdex 200 HR 16/60 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mutation of AviTag-4-1BBL C51S was performed with 5′-GATCCCTCGCCTCCCCCTGGGCCGT-3′ and 5′-ACGGCCCAGGGGGAGGCGAGGGATC-3′ primers, using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Production was performed as described above. Production of AviTag-4-1BBL in the Insect Cell Line S2—To allow secretion of AviTag-4-1BBL protein by S2 Drosophila cells, the cDNA coding for the IL6 signal peptide was added to the 5′-end of the bacterial construct, and the whole construct was subcloned in the pRmHa-3 expression vector which carries a copper-inducible promoter (a kind gift from Dr. Goldstein). S2 cells were co-transfected with the pRmHa-3 and pCoblast, which carries blasticidin resistance using the CaCl2 method and selected with blasticidin over a period of 3 weeks (25 μg/ml, Invitrogen). The bulk culture of blasticidin-resistant cells was cloned by limiting dilution using non-transfected irradiated S2 Drosophila cells as a feeder. Clones were assayed for AviTag-4-1BBL production by intra-cytoplasmic staining with an anti-4-1BBL monoclonal Ab (BD Biosciences). Clone 1 was grown to a concentration of 5.106/ml in a serumfree culture medium (Invitrogen), and protein production was induced by the addition of 0.75 mm CuSO4 for 5 days at 27 °C. The supernatant was concentrated on a VivaFlow concentrator cell, separated on a DEAE column, and biotinylated as described above. The protein was finally purified by anion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ HR 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). FLAG-4-1BBL was purchased from Alexis. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis of 4-1BBL Proteins—Recombinant 4-1BBL proteins and native membrane 4-1BBL were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide gels). Gels were stained with saturated Coomassie Blue R250 (Sigma) when appropriate. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). AviTag-4-1BBL was detected with 1 μg/ml of a goat anti-4-1BBL polyclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat Ab (1:15,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Revelation was performed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In certain cases, proteins were cross-linked prior to Western blotting using the non-reversible, homobifunctional, and water-soluble cross-linking agent BS3 (Pierce). BS3 (10 mm in water) was then added to 40 pmol of protein, to give the required final concentration (125-500 μm) and cross-linking was allowed to take place for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 1 m Tris, pH 7.5. For the analysis of native 4-1BBL, membrane proteins were extracted from T2 cells using Triton X-114 as previously described (26Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 60×106 T2 cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-114 (Sigma) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Boehringer) for 30 min on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and nuclei, and overlaid on an ice-cold sucrose cushion (6% w/v sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.06% Triton X-114). A clouding of the solution occurred after a 3-min incubation at 30 °C. The tube was then centrifuged for 3 min at 300 × g at room temperature to recover the detergent phase as an oily droplet from the bottom of the tube. The detergent phase enriched in membrane proteins was precipitated by MEOH/CHCl3 4:1 (v/v) before loading onto a 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analyses—Binding experiments of the different recombinant 4-1BBL proteins to a recombinant human 4-1BB-Fc chimera (R&D Systems) were performed with a BIAcore 2000 optical biosensor (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The human 4-1BB/Fc protein was covalently coupled to a carboxymethyl dextran flow cell (CM5 BIAcore) as recommended by the manufacturer. The level of immobilization was set at 500 resonance units. The binding of purified mutant and native 4-1BBL was assayed at 25 °C with concentrations ranging from 0.725 to 72.46 nm at a flow rate of 40 μl/min in HBS-EP buffer (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20). Association was monitored for 5 min before initiating the dissociation phase for another 10 min with HBS-EP buffer. The flow cells were regenerated by a 1-min pulse with 10 mm glycine-HCl at pH 1.8. The resulting sensorgrams were analyzed using the BIA Evaluation software 3.2 (BIAcore AB). Multimerization of the Different Recombinant 4-1BBLs—AviTag-4-1BBL (wild type (WT) and C51S) was coated onto M280 streptavidin magnetic beads by incubating decreasing concentrations of biotinylated proteins (ranging from 10 μg/ml to 5 ng/ml) with 67.103 M280 magnetic microbeads (Dynal Biotech) for 2 h at room temperature under continuous agitation. The FLAG-4-1BBL was coated in the same conditions using M280 tosylactivated magnetic beads covalently linked to an anti-FLAG mAb (clone M2, Sigma). The saturation of the beads was checked by flow cytometry using either a mouse monoclonal PE-conjugated anti-4-1BBL (clone C65-485, BD Biosciences) or a goat anti-4-1BBL polyclonal Ab followed by an adsorbed fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-goat Ab as a secondary reagent (Serotec). Saturation, estimated by the fluorescence plateau, was obtained with 0.5 pg/bead of AviTag-4-1BBL and 2 pg/bead of FLAG-4-1BBL. Tetramerization with streptavidin is usually attained by mixing streptavidin (Sigma) and AviTag-4-1BBL at a molecular ratio of 1:4 for 1 h at room temperature. To obtain a mixture of the different multimers (tetramers, trimers, dimers, and monomers) AviTag-4-1BBL was incubated with a molar excess of streptavidin, and the different forms were then separated by gel filtration. Cell Isolation and Functional Assays—Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and resuspended in RPMI medium (Sigma) supplemented with 1% l-glutamine and 8% human serum. Purified T cells were obtained from fresh blood by negative selection using a RosetteSep isolation kit (StemCell Technologies). The purity of the T lymphocyte preparation was checked by flow cytometry with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD3 mAb (BD Biosciences) and was always above 95%. T lymphocytes (105/well, flat bottom 96-well plates, Falcon) were stimulated for 72 h with biotinylated anti-CD3 mAb (clone UCHT1, BD Biosciences) immobilized on M280 streptavidin magnetic beads. OKT3 (Orthoclone) immobilized in flat bottom 96-well plates was used to stimulate PBMC (105/well) overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline instead of anti-CD3-coated beads, because macrophages tended to engulf the beads. All 4-1BB ligands were added after 6 h of CD3 stimulation to allow the induction of 4-1BB expression on T lymphocytes. Proliferation was estimated by measuring the incorporation of tritiated thymidine in quadruplicate samples during the last 16 h of culture. The binding of the different recombinant 4-1BBLs to CD3-activated or resting T lymphocytes was evaluated after 48 h. Staining was performed at room temperature for 1 h using either PE-conjugated anti-4-1BB mAb (clone 4B4-1, BD Biosciences), AviTag-4-1BBL at 10 μg/ml revealed by PE-conjugated streptavidin at 0.5 μg/ml or FLAG-4-1BBL at 10 μg/ml revealed with a combination of mouse anti-FLAG mAb (10 μg/ml) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 Ab (10 μg/ml). Staining of 4-1BBL on the T2 hybridoma was performed using PE-conjugated anti-4-1BBL (clone C65-485) for 45 min at 4 °C. Flow cytometry was performed on a FacScan (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with the CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences). Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Results were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by either Tukey-Kramer or Dunnett post-tests. Post-tests were only performed when the analysis of variance test showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) between groups. Modeling of the Three-dimensional Structure of 4-1BBL— 4-1BBL belongs to the TNF superfamily and, as such, is presumed to be trimeric like the other members of the family (27Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), although no information on its three-dimensional structure has yet been provided. We thus decided to generate a model of 4-1BBL structure. We firstly performed a sequence alignment of the TNF-homology domain (THD) of human 4-1BBL with that of mouse TNF, mouse RANKL, human CD40L and human APO2L (Fig. 1A). The THD of 4-1BBL displayed a 17.6, 21.6, 17.8, and 19.5% sequence homology with TNF, RANKL, CD40L, and APO2L, respectively. With this alignment and based on x-ray structures of mouse TNF, mouse RANKL, human CD40L, and human APO2L, a model of the THD of human 4-1BBL was generated (see “Materials and Methods”). A ribbon representation of the final model is given in Fig. 1B, showing two stacked β-pleated sheets each made up of five anti-parallel β-strands that adopt the classical “jelly-roll” topology found in proteins belonging to the TNF family (27Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The inner sheet (strands A, A′, H, C, and F) may be involved in trimer contacts (Fig. 1B, left) and the outer sheet (strands B, B′, D, E, and G) may be exposed to the solvent (27Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 19-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). An analysis of hydrophobicity revealed a large hydrophobic area containing residues constituting the sheet potentially involved in trimer formation: Phe-7 and Val-11 (strand A), Val-149, Phe-153, Val-155, and Ile-159 (strand H), Val-55 and Phe-59 (strand C), Phe-112, Phe-114, Leu-118, and Leu-119 (strand F) (Fig. 1B, middle). In addition, charged residues such as Arg-65, Glu-63, and Asp-99 located close to the hydrophobic area may also contribute to trimer formation (Fig. 1B, right). A previous crystallographic analysis of the LTα/TNFR1 complex showed that loops of the trimeric ligand are particularly involved in contact with the receptor, especially loops AA′, DE, EF, and CD (28Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). In our model, the low number of conserved residues found in those loops of 4-1BBL and the high flexibility of these regions support their implication in defining the specificity of ligand-receptor interaction. The Extracellular Domain of 4-1BBL Forms a Trimer Containing a Disulfide Bond—To produce recombinant soluble 4-1BBL, we engineered a cDNA construct coding for the whole extracellular domain of human 4-1BBL coupled to a biotin tag, the AviTag. This construct included the 43-amino-acid long tail spanning from the membrane to the THD and thus differed from a commercially available FLAG-tagged 4-1BBL (Alexis) (Fig. 1C). It should be noted that this tail contains a cysteine residue close to the membrane. We first produced the AviTag-4-1BBL protein with a theoretical mass of 23 kDa as inclusion bodies in E. coli. The purity of inclusion bodies exceeded 95%, as evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. 2A). After refolding and concentration, gel filtration analysis revealed two major peaks, Peaks 1 and 2, with a molecular mass of around 140 and 70 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2B). Peak 2 was compatible with a trimeric form of AviTag-4-1BBL. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by Western blotting of Peak 2 showed that the trimeric form dissociated into a monomer and a dimer. The homodimer contained a disulfide bond as demonstrated by its disappearance under reducing conditions (Fig. 3A). An analysis of Peak 1 by Western blot under reducing and non-reducing conditions showed an identical profile (not shown), suggesting that it corresponded to a multimeric complex of AviTag-4-1BBL linked by disulfide bonds. This form was discarded, as it was considered to be wrongly folded, because it turned out to be totally inactive in the functional assays described later. As expected, FLAG-4-1BBL appeared only as a monomer on SDS-PAGE because it lacks the cysteine-containing region (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3A, Western blot analysis of purified WT AviTag-4-1BBL produced in E. coli and FLAG-4-1BBL produced in HEK293 with a polyclonal goat anti-4-1BBL Ab. FLAG-4-1BBL appeared as a single band at the expected 20-kDa molecular mass. WT AviTag-4-1BBL dissociated into a monomer of 23 kDa and a dimer that disappeared under reducing conditions. The additional lower band represented a truncated form. B, same analysis as in A, with WT AviTag 4-1BBL produced in S2 Drosophila cells. Dimers containing a disulfide bond and monomers could be observed. C, analysis of 4-1BBL expression on the T2 hybridoma cell line by flow cytometry after staining with a mouse anti-4-1BBL mAb. D, same as in A with membrane-bound 4-1BBL from T2 cells. Triton X-114 extracts from 6 × 107 T2 cells were precipitated and loaded in each well. Western blot revealed the presence of a dimer containing a disulfide bond. E, same as in A, after cross-linking of WT AviTag-4-1BBL with BS3. Addition of increasing concentrations of BS3 resulted in the appearance of higher molecular weight bands compatible with trimers and possibly dimers of trimers. F, same as in E with FLAG-4-1BBL. Cross-linking generated weak dimeric forms and aggregates but no visible trimers. βME, 2-mercaptoethanol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next sought to determine whether the disulfide bond present in the trimeric form of AviTag-4-1BBL could have been artificially generated during the refolding of bacterial inclusion bodies. For this purpose, soluble AviTag-4-1BBL was produced in the Drosophila S2 expression system. In this system, the expressed protein is naturally processed inside the cell and then excreted into the culture medium. The analysis of AviTag-4-1BBL produced in S2 supernatants revealed a similar profile as that obtained with refolded inclusion bodies (Fig. 3B). This suggested that the disulfide bond was naturally formed in eucaryotic cells during AviTag-4-1BBL processing and export. To ascertain whether the disulfide bond was actually present in physiologically expressed 4-1BBL, Western blot analyses were performed on Triton X-114 extracts from T2 hybridoma cells that constitutively express 4-1BBL (Fig. 3C). A similar profile was obtained, with a dimeric form that could be reduced by 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 3D), thus pointing to the physiological nature of the disulfide bond. Finally, we performed cross-linking experiments with BS3 on refolded AviTag-4-1BBL and FLAG-4-1BBL to visualize trimers by SDS-PAGE. Cross-linking of AviTag-4-1BBL with BS3 resulted in the appearance of bands of higher molecular mass, of which one could correspond to a trimer (around 70 kDa) and another (around 140 kDa) may represent dimers of trimers (Fig. 3E). This observation further demonstrated that AviTag-4-1BBL refolded as a trimer. In marked contrast, cross-linking of FLAG-4-1BBL revealed no trimeric forms but only a band compatible with dimers and a strong band corresponding to large aggregates that did not penetrate into the gel (Fig. 3F). Considering that the dimeric forms probably originated from the dissociation by SDS of pre-existing and partially cross-linked trimers, our data suggest that only a very small fraction of FLAG-4-1BBL was in trimeric form (and thus undetectable as such after BS3 cross-linking), whereas most of it was monomeric. The Disulfide Bond Stabilizes Trimeric AviTag-4-1BBL—To investigate the role of the disulfide bond in 4-1BBL structure and function, we produced a mutated AviTag-4-1BBL where cysteine was replaced by serine (C51S). Because the cysteine residue is located well outside the THD of 4-1BBL, it was a"

Here we have characterized the intracellular lipidation of newly synthesized apoA-I, in primary hepatocytes cultured with [3H]choline to label choline-phospholipids, low density lipoprotein-[3H]cholesterol to label the cell surface, or [3H]mevalonate to label de novo synthesized cholesterol. Phospholipidation of apoA-I is significant and most evident in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and medial Golgi, both in the lumen and on the membrane fractions of the ER and medial Golgi. In the presence of cycloheximide, endogenous apoA-I is substantially phospholipidated intracellularly but acquires some additional lipid after export out of the cell. In cells labeled with low density lipoprotein-[3H]cholesterol, intracellular cholesterol lipidation of apoA-I is entirely absent, but the secreted apoA-I rapidly accumulates cholesterol after secretion from the cell in the media. On the other hand, de novo synthesized cholesterol can lipidate apoA-I intracellularly. We also showed the interaction between apoA-I and ABCA1 in ER and Golgi fractions. In hepatocytes lacking ABCA1, lipidation by low density lipoprotein-cholesterol was significantly reduced at the plasma membrane, phospholipidation and lipidation by de novo synthesized sterols were both reduced in Golgi compartments, whereas ER lipidation remained mostly unchanged. Therefore, the early lipidation in ER is ABCA1 independent, but in contrast, the lipidation of apoA-I in Golgi and at the plasma membrane requires ABCA1. Thus, we demonstrated that apoA-I phospholipidation starts early in the ER and is partially dependent on ABCA1, with the bulk of lipidation by phospholipids and cholesterol occurring in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, respectively. Finally, we showed that the previously reported association of newly synthesized apoA-I and apoB (Zheng, H., Kiss, R. S., Franklin, V., Wang, M. D., Haidar, B., and Marcel, Y. L. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 21612–21621) occurs after secretion at the cell surface.

Chisholm and colleagues (12Chisholm J.W. Burleson E.R. Shelness G.S. Parks J.S. J.

Although in chicken livers, the newly secreted apoA-I accumulates lipids necessary to obtain the structure of a mature HDL, this is not the case in primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells where lipidpoor apoA-I has often been found in the medium (13Melin B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 10119-10127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we addressed this issue indirectly, comparing the phospholipidation of endogenously synthesized apoA-I and exogenously added apoA-I. We showed that endogenous apoA-I consistently acquired more phospholipids and formed more HDL size particles than exogenous apoA-I (15Kiss R.S. McManus D.C. Franklin V. Tan W.L. McKenzie A. Chimini G. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10119-10127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The phospholipidation of newly synthesized apoA-I is for the most part dependent on ABCA1, but the transfer of cholesterol to apoA-I is controlled by more complex pathways less dependent on ABCA1 (16Zheng H. Kiss R.S. Franklin V. Wang M.D. Haidar B. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21612-21621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unlike apoB, which is degraded if not sufficiently lipidated, apoA-I can be secreted as poorly lipidated complexes, perhaps even as a lipid-free protein. As indicated above, endogenously synthesized apoA-I forms particles of the same size in ABCA1-deficient hepatocytes and control cells, only it forms much fewer of the large particles in the absence of ABCA1 (15Kiss R.S.

Therefore apoA-I secretion is not controlled by lipid availability and the type of particle formed is dictated by the apoA-I structure and its ability to form dimers and tetramers that accommodate specific amounts of lipids. Here, we investigated the different steps of apoA-I lipidation as it traffics from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, until its secretion. We have identified early steps of phospholipidation in the ER that are independent of ABCA1 activity, and we characterized the intracellular compartments that contribute to the transfer of cholesterol to apoA-I during secretion. We also define the site of apoA-I association with apoB-containing lipoproteins.

Rubin, DOE Joint Genome Institute, Berkeley, CA) by collagenase liver perfusion. The cells were plated on fibronectin-coated 10-cm plates and grown in Williams media (Invitrogen). [3H]Choline (10 μCi/ml) and [3H]mevalonate (15 μCi/ml) were directly added to loading media (hepatozyme media with 1% l-glutamine and 1% antimycotic antibiotic reagent). [3H]Cholesterol (10 μCi/ml) was dried under nitrogen into a thin film, then solubilized in a small volume of ethanol. LDL was added to the [3H]cholesterol and equilibrated with the LDL for one-half hour before adding to loading media. Five hours after the initial seeding, cells were incubated with loading media labeled with [3H]choline, [3H]mevalonate, or [3H]cholesterol. The next day (24 h later) the labeled media was removed and the cells were infected for 1 h with a recombinant adenovirus encoding apoA-I (Ad-AI) or control luciferase (Ad-Luc) at a multiplicity of infection of 75:1 plaque-forming units per cell in Williams Medium E without serum (19McManus D.C.

After the 1-h infection, the adenovirus containing media was removed and the radioactive media returned for another 24 h. Cellular Fractionation and Preparation of Nycodenz Gradient—The subcellular fractionation protocol was essentially as described in Tran et al. (20Tran K. Thorne-Tjomsland G. DeLong C.J. Cui Z. Shan J. Burton L. Jamieson J.C. Yao Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31187-31200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). At the end of the labeling period, the cells were washed twice with Williams media. At time 0, cycloheximide in hepatozyme media was added to cells (3.55 μl/ml of 100 mm stock). At the appropriate time point (0, 20, 40, and 60 min), the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then scraped with a plastic scraper. The collected cells were then spun down at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 15 °C. The pellet was resuspended in membrane solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose in ddH2O, Complete protease inhibitor mixture, 5 μm EDTA, pH 8) and homogenized using a ball bearing homogenization apparatus. The cell homogenate was then transferred to 15-ml glass Corex tubes and centrifuged at 9000 × g for 10 min at 5 °C, and the supernatant was kept. Nycodenz stock solution (27.6% Nycodenz in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA) and saline buffer were used to prepare four Nycodenz solutions of increasing percent concentrations (10, 14.66, 19.33, and 24%) and 2.5 ml of each were loaded from the bottom of the tube (Beckman Polyallomer Centrifuge Tubes) in decreasing percentage order. The tubes were then sealed with a piece of parafilm, and a linear gradient was formed by placing the tubes horizontally for 45 min at room temperature. The tubes were then centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 4 h at 15 °C (Beckman L8–70 M Ultracentrifuge). The supernatant was layered on top of the created Nycodenz gradient and centrifuged at 37,000 × g, for 1.5 h at 15 °C (SW41 rotor). Following the spin, each tube was fractionated into 15 aliquots. These aliquots were stored at 4 °C for Western blotting and determination of radioactive content. Separation of Lumenal and Membrane-bound Fractions—To separate microsomal lumen from membranes, the 15 aliquots were grouped into 3 microsomal fractions (aliquots 1–3 distal Golgi fraction, 4–8 medial Golgi fraction, and 9–15 ER fraction). 1.5 ml were removed from each fraction and 1.5 ml of 0.2 m Na2CO3, pH 12.4, were added to each condition. The samples were allowed to mix on a rotator for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were transferred to open-end tubes (Beckman Polyallomer Thick Wall 3.2 ml tubes) and centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min at 15 °C (TLA 100.4/TLA110). The supernatant, representing the lumenal content of each intracellular compartment, was collected and the pH adjusted to 8 with 75 μl of 2.5 n HCl. The pellet representing the membrane fraction was resuspended in 250 μl of membrane solubilization buffer. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was preformed on subcellular and media samples collected during the fractionation procedure. 90 μl of anti-apoA-I antibody (Calbiochem) was added to 3 ml of sample. The samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight with continuous mixing. The next day, 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the samples and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g at 10 °C for 10 min (Sorvall RT 6000D). The supernatant was discarded and the pellet washed 3 times. When immunoprecipitating apoB with rabbit anti-apoB antibody (Biodesign) the same procedure was followed except that protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was used. When apoA-I was immunoprecipitated from a membrane sample, the sample was treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. The solubilized sample was then centrifuged at 75,000 × g for 30 min at 15 °C (TLA 100.4/TLA110) and the supernatant loaded on a gel. Western Blotting—Protein samples from aliquots and fractions were separated on a 3–15% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked (5% skim milk in 0.5% Tween PBS) for 30 min and washed three times for 15 min in 0.5% Tween PBS. Primary mouse anti-human apoA-I antibodies 5F6 and 4H1 (University of Ottawa Heart Institute) were added at 1:1000 dilution. Primary anti-mouse apoB antibody (a gift from Dr. Ross Milne) was added at 1:1000 dilution. Rabbit anti-mouse TGN38 antibody (BD Biosciences) was added at 1:1000 dilution. Rabbit anti-mouse EEAI antibody (Affinity Bioreagents) was added at 1:1000 dilution. Rabbit anti-mouse ManII antibody (a gift from Dr. Zemin Yao) was added at 1:2000 dilution. Rabbit anti-mouse calnexin antibody (Stressgen Bioreagents) was added at 1:3000 dilution. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the membrane was washed three times at 15 min in 0.5% Tween-PBS. Secondary antibodies were added at 1:5000 dilution and the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. For apoA-I and apoB, sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibodies were used (Amersham Biosciences). For all the remaining proteins, donkey anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibodies were used (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was washed 3 times for 15 min in 1× PBS with 0.5% Tween. The membrane was then washed with SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) for 5 min and exposed to film. Lipid Extraction and TLC Analysis—Lipids associated with immunoprecipitated samples (1 ml) were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). To determine the amount of [3H]choline incorporated into sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine, phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using a polar solvent system containing CHCl3:methanol:acetic acid:formic acid:H2O (105:45:18:6:3, v/v). The lipids on the TLC plate were stained with iodine, and the appropriate bands scraped. The associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. To determine the amount of [3H]mevalonate incorporated into cholesterol versus cholesteryl esters, the non-polar solvent system hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (105:45:1.5) was used. Gas Chromatography Analysis—For GC analysis, samples from the immunoprecipitation of apoA-I and media samples were resuspended in PBS and the lipids extracted (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). The lipid extract was divided in two. One sample for unesterified cholesterol determination was dried under nitrogen and stored at –20 °C. The other sample for total cholesterol determination was hydrolyzed with alcoholic KOH at 60 °C for 1. Cholesterol was extracted with hexane and evaporated under nitrogen and frozen at –20 °C. Stigmasterol was added as an internal standard and the dried samples were treated with Sil-A derivatization chemical (Sigma) prior to GC-MS analysis. Isolation of LDL—LDL was isolated from a peripheral blood sample by sequential density ultracentrifugation. The concentration of LDL was calculated using the Markwell Lowry protein assay. Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from C57BL/6 ABCA1+/+ mice by collagenase liver perfusion, and cultured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were lysed and subcellular fractions isolated by Nycodenz gradient centrifugation. Antibodies against specific intracellular marker proteins were used to identify the various fractions (Fig. 1). The protein markers EEAI and TGN38 identify early endosomes and distal Golgi (dGolgi) microsomes, respectively. ManII and calnexin are markers of medial Golgi (mGolgi) and ER microsomes, respectively. The first three fractions were pooled to represent dGolgi with some early endosome vesicles. Fractions 4–6 and 9–15 were pooled to represent mGolgi and ER vesicles, respectively. Steady State ApoA-I Lipidation with [3H]Choline-phospholipids or LDL-derived [3H]Cholesterol and ApoA-I-mediated Export of Cholesterol—To determine whether phospholipids and cholesterol become associated with apoA-I in ER and Golgi compartments, primary mouse hepatocytes were labeled with [3H]choline or LDL-[3H]cholesterol, infected with either Ad-Luc or adenovirus expressing apoA-I, and labeling was pursued by continued culture in labeling medium. The cells were then washed, homogenized, and subcellular fractions isolated. ApoA-I was immunoprecipitated and the associated radioactive lipid measured. We observed very significant acquisition of choline-labeled lipids by apoA-I in the ER compartment (Fig. 2). The presence of phospholipidated apoA-I was also evident in the mGolgi, although radioactivity was consistently lower in Golgi compared with ER. Under the same conditions, when the cells were labeled with [3H]cholesterol derived from LDL, lipidation with cholesterol was almost completely absent. We have shown previously that cholesterol delivered with LDL preferentially labels the cell surface pool, including the recycling endosome compartment (16Zheng H. Kiss R.S. Franklin V. Wang M.D. Haidar B. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21612-21621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore the absence of cholesterol labeling of ER and Golgi by exogenous cholesterol explains these negative results. ApoA-I Protein Localization following Cycloheximide Treatment— Pulse-chase experiments were performed, where the cells were cultured as described above and at time 0 treated with cycloheximide to inhibit any new production of apoA-I (Fig. 3). The cells were collected at 0, 20, and 40 min and subcellular fractions isolated as described. ApoA-I was located both on the membrane fractions and in the lumen of ER, mGolgi, and dGolgi for the first hour following cycloheximide addition and accumulated in the media (Fig. 3A). Densitometric quantification of Western blot bands show that initially, apoA-I is located in all three intracellular compartments, mainly in the dGolgi and mGolgi, whereas the ER seems to contain the smallest amount, a result compatible with a previous report of the rapid transit of apoA-I (10Banerjee D. Redman C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). With time the ER compartment emptied and apoA-I transits into mGolgi and dGolgi. After 40 min, apoA-I leaves the mGolgi to accumulate in the media. The subcellular fractions were treated with sodium carbonate to release the proteins residing inside the ER and Golgi vesicles and centrifuged to separate lumen and membrane compartments. Western blotting (Fig. 3B) shows at 0 and 20 min the presence of a large amount of membrane-bound apoA-I in the mGolgi fraction, which contrast with the low level of membrane-bound apoA-I in dGolgi. At 40 min in the dGolgi, we observed only the presence of lumenal apoA-I, which suggests that the progressive lipidation of apoA-I caused the release of apoA-I as a soluble complex. Intracellular Lipidation of ApoA-I in ABCA1 WT Cells after Cycloheximide Treatment—Hepatocytes from C57BL/6 ABCA1+/+ mice were labeled with [3H]choline, [3H]cholesterol, or [3H]mevalonate and infected with Ad-human-AI as described above. Phospholipid and cholesterol lipidation of apoA-I was assessed after addition of cycloheximide for 0, 20, and 40 min. In [3H]choline-labeled cells, immunoprecipitation of apoA-I in the different subcellular fractions shows that the phospholipidation of apoA-I starts in the ER, and continues through the Golgi leading to the secretion of phospholipidated apoA-I (Fig. 4A). Clearly, apoA-I binds phospholipids during or soon after its translation, and ER apoA-I, despite its low concentration, retains a high level of labeled phospholipids throughout the chase. ApoA-I remained significantly lipidated during transit through the mGolgi, but its clearance from the dGolgi (Fig. 3B) may explain the low level of apoA-I-associated phospholipids in that fraction (Fig. 4A). After 20 min, it is evident that some of the intracellularly phospholipidated apoA-I left the cell and could be found in the media, where it continues to accumulate. The distribution of [3H]choline label in the phospholipids associated with apoA-I was analyzed by TLC. The lumenal fraction was isolated from the ER and Golgi compartments, and the lipids associated with immunoprecipitated apoA-I were extracted and separated by TLC. Phosphatidylcholine associated with apoA-I early in the ER lumen and peaked at 20 min (Fig. 5). Some sphingomyelin radioactivity started to associate with apoA-I early in the ER, but the majority was seen in the mGolgi (Fig. 5), where sphingomyelin is synthesized. Very little phosphatidylcholine or sphingomyelin radioactivity was measured in dGolgi. The specificity of cholesterol binding by apoA-I was strikingly different when the cells were labeled with LDL-[3H]cholesterol (Fig. 4B), a protocol that preferentially labels the cell surface compartment (16Zheng H. Kiss R.S. Franklin V. Wang M.D. Haidar B. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21612-21621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At all three time points, intracellular lipidation was almost non-existent. However, secreted apoA-I in the media was able to accumulate a large amount of cholesterol at the plasma membrane. This lipidation was significant at time 0 and continued to increase over the next 40 min, reflecting the transfer of cholesterol to secreted apoA-I at the level of plasma membrane and recycling endosomes. The absence of cholesterol-labeled apoA-I in the dGolgi fraction suggest that secreted apoA-I does not recycle to this fraction. To ascertain whether or not apoA-I can acquire cholesterol in the early stages of synthesis and transport, the cells were cultured with [3H]mevalonate to label de novo synthesized cholesterol, which originates in the ER and transits along the pathway of apoA-I transport. The results showed that de novo synthesized cholesterol does lipidate apoA-I early in ER and remain associated to apoA-I in Golgi compartments as well as after the secretion of the lipoprotein particle out of the cell (Fig. 4C). The amount of de novo synthesized cholesterol bound to apoA-I in ER remains constant throughout the secretion pathway. This lipidation is significant and complements the acquisition of cholesterol by apoA-I that occurs at the cell surface. TLC analysis of the lipids immunoprecipitated with apoA-I showed that [3H]mevalonate was almost exclusively found in the cholesterol fractions with very little if any with cholesteryl esters (data not shown). It is clear that hepatic apoA-I secretion is accompanied by the export of cholesterol and phospholipids. To provide a quantitative evaluation, we measured by GC-MS the net mass of cholesterol associated with the immunoprecipitated apoA-I after a 3-h time point. In the total intracellular lumenal compartments, we found a total of 11.7 ng of cholesterol/μg of total secreted apoA-I. In all the membrane compartments, we found 2.5 ng of cholesterol/μg of secreted apoA-I. In the media, we measured 6.7 ng of cholesterol/μg of secreted apoA-I.

https://openalex.org/W2093341571,"ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs), a circulating multidomain zinc metalloprotease of the reprolysin subfamily, is critical for preventing von Willebrand factor-platelet interaction under high shear stress conditions. A deficiency of the protease, due to mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene or the presence of antibodies that inhibit the activity of the protease, causes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Plasma therapy, the conventional therapy for TTP, may cause serious adverse reactions and is ineffective in some patients. In order to develop new strategies for improving the diagnosis and treatment of TTP, we produced a series of truncated ADAMTS13 proteins in mammalian cells and analyzed their binding with and suppression by the IgG derived from the TTP patients. The results revealed that truncation of the ADAMTS13 protein at its cysteine-rich region eliminated its recognition by the antibodies without abolishing its von Willebrand factor-cleaving activity. This raises the possibility that resistant ADAMTS13 variants may be exploited to circumvent inhibitory antibodies that cause TTP."
https://openalex.org/W1974633972,"Dmc1 is specifically required for homologous recombination during meiosis. Here we report that the calcium ion enabled Dmc1 from budding yeast to form regular helical filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and activate its strand assimilation activity. Relative to magnesium, calcium increased the affinity of Dmc1 for ATP and but reduces its DNA-dependent ATPase activity. These effects, together with previous studies of other RecA-like recombinases, support the view that ATP binding to Dmc1 protomers is required for functional filament structure. The helical pitch of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dmc1-ssDNA helical filament was estimated to be 13.4 ± 2.5 nm. Analysis of apparently “complete” Dmc1-ssDNA filaments indicated a stoichiometry of 24 ± 2 nucleotides per turn of the Dmc1 helix. This finding suggests that the number or protomers per helical turn and/or the number of nucleotides bound per Dmc1 protomer differs from that reported previously for Rad51 and RecA filaments. Our data support the view that the active form of Dmc1 protein is a helical filament rather than a ring. We speculate that Ca2+ plays a significant role in regulating meiotic recombination.

Using atomic force microscope (AFM) with carbon nanotube tips (CNTs), we recently showed that the ScDmc1 protein alone also forms octameric rings. In addition, in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ and 1 mm adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), 90% of ScDmc1 protein bound ssDNA as protein rings and only 10% was able to form a filamentous nucleoprotein structure (14Chang Y.C.

The results presented below indicate that substituting Ca2+ for Mg2+ enhances the biochemical activity of the protein in recombination reactions. This increase in activity is associated with an increased tendency of the protein to form regular helical filaments on DNA. These findings support the view that ScDmc1 becomes catalytically active only when it forms a helical nucleoprotein filament with ssDNA (9Sehorn M.G. Sigurdsson S. Bussen W. Unger V.M. Sung P.

Proteins and DNA—The ScDmc1 protein was purified as described previously (8Hong E.L. Shinohara A. Bishop D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41906-41912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). ΦX174 ssDNA was purchased from New England Biolabs. In this study, the DNA concentrations are expressed as moles of nucleotides. Strand Assimilation (“D-loop”) Assay—The ability of Dmc1 to promote homologous strand assimilation was determined by homology-dependent association of oligonucleotide and supercoiled plasmid using a method similar to that described previously (8Hong E.L. Shinohara A. Bishop D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41906-41912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this assay, Dmc1 is first bound to ssDNA oligonucleotide, and then a homolog-containing super-coiled target plasmid is added. Standard Dmc1-oligo binding reactions were 15 μl and contained Dmc1 (0.54 μm), 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 306.7 (1.0 μm) (8Hong E.L. Shinohara A. Bishop D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41906-41912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP (or AMP-PNP), and 1 mm divalent cation. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C to allow the formation of Dmc1-ssDNA complexes. After preincubation, 10 μl of 4.6 μm supercoiled target plasmid DNA (pRS307) in 23.5 mm divalent cation was added each binding reaction (final divalent cation concentration of 10 mm). Samples were further incubated to allow strand assimilation to occur before being stopped by the addition of SDS and proteinase K to final concentrations of 0.08% and 0.16 mg/ml, respectively. Samples were further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was then separated on 1.3% agarose gels for 1.5 h at 105 V. Gels were squashed onto nylon membranes using a stack of paper towels and a 0.5-kg weight. Gels were analyzed by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics) with the efficiency of D-loop formation given as the ratio of counts co-migrating with pRS307 over the total counts in each lane. The method gives a significant overestimate of the true reaction efficiency, as some unbound oligo is lost during the squashing procedure. Nonetheless, the efficiencies given provide a reliable means to compare numbers within an experiment. ScDmc1 ATPase Assay—ΦX174 ssDNA (1 mm in nucleotides) was incubated first at 30 °C in buffer E (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 120 mm NaCl, and 2.4 μm ScDmc1 protein) plus variable amounts of magnesium chloride and/or calcium chloride as indicated. ATP hydrolysis was initiated by addition of different amounts of [γ-32P]ATP (0.4-1 mm) at 30 °C. At the times indicated, 0.3-ml aliquots were withdrawn and spotted on thin layer chromatography paper (polyethyleneimine-cellulose; Sigma). Plates were developed in 1.0 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl (14Chang Y.C. Lo Y.H. Lee M.H. Leng C.H. Hu S.M. Chang C.S. Wang T.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6052-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) was used to quantify the release of PO4-32 from [γ-32P] ATP. Kinetic parameters were determined by curve fitting using the Michaelis-Menten equation with a non-linear least squares algorithm (Microcal Origin software). AFM—The AFM-CNT method was carried out as described (14Chang Y.C. Lo Y.H. Lee M.H. Leng C.H. Hu S.M. Chang C.S. Wang T.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6052-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), expect that 1 mm magnesium chloride was replaced by either 1 mm calcium or 1 mm magnesium chloride plus 0-0.1 mm calcium chloride. An 872-nucleotide HaeIII ssDNA fragment from viral ΦX174 ssDNA was generated and purified by the method described previously (14Chang Y.C. Lo Y.H. Lee M.H. Leng C.H. Hu S.M. Chang C.S. Wang T.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6052-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Samples for AFM contained ScDmc1 (1 nm), ssDNA (3 nm), 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm CaCl2 (or 1 mm MgCl2 plus 10-100 μm CaCl2). Solutions were spotted on mica and visualized by a tapping mode AFM machine with CNT tips. To ensure a flat background before image analysis, the image is flattened and plane-fitted with the aide of the microscope's analysis software (Digital Instrument, version 4.42r4) (14Chang Y.C.

The position of surface features observed in the phase image can be correlated directly with the surface topography. Hence, high resolution images can be obtained without additional deconvolution or reconstruction procedures. The AFM machine was calibrated sequentially using two different calibration specimens. The cross-lined grating replica (3.05 mm; Electron Microscopy Sciences) contains parallel line gratings with spacing of 462 nm and a height of 31 nm. The Ultrasharp TGZ01 silicon gratings (3 × 3-mm array with nominal step height ∼19 nm) were purchased from NT-MDT (Moscow, Russia). The accuracy of Z scale (or height) and the X-Y scale is ± 0.5 and 2 nm, respectively. Calcium Enhances ScDmc1-mediated Homologous Strand Assimilation—A cursory analysis indicated that budding yeast Dmc1 can form D-loops more efficiently in the presence of Ca2+ than in the presence of Mg2+ (15Hong E.L. Facilitating the Homology Search: Biochemical Characterization of Dmc1, a Meiosis-Specific Recombinase. The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL2002: 84-108Google Scholar). We further characterized this effect by carrying out time course analysis under two conditions (Fig. 1). First, we used conditions previously optimized for product yield in the presence of Mg2+. In these reactions, the concentration of divalent cation was increased from 1 to 10 mm when the target duplex was added. Under this condition, the initial rate and final yield of product formation were ∼5-fold greater in Ca2+ than in Mg2+ (Fig. 1). The second condition retained divalent concentration at 1 mm following target addition. This condition was chosen because it is the same as that used to examine the structure of Dmc1-ssDNA complexes in our previous structural study (14Chang Y.C. Lo Y.H. Lee M.H. Leng C.H. Hu S.M. Chang C.S. Wang T.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6052-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as well as in the structural experiments described below. When divalent cation was retained at 1 mm, the difference in the efficiency of assimilation was even more dramatic than in the previous condition; no assimilation was detected with Mg2+, whereas Ca2+ supported a level of D-loop formation only ∼2-fold less efficient that that seen with the higher divalent concentration. Given that intracellular free Ca2+ and Mg2+ levels in Saccharomyces cerevisiae had been estimated to range from 0.3 μm to 1 mm and from 0.1 mm to 1 mm, respectively (16Halachmi D. Eilam Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 256: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Beeler T. Bruce K. Dunn T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that the lower concentrations are more physiological and, therefore, that Ca2+ is more likely than Mg2+ to be the relevant cofactor for Dmc1 activity in vivo. The ssDNA-dependent ATPase Activity of ScDmc1 Is Lower in Ca2+ than in Mg2+—To shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying Ca2+ activation, we examined the ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity of scDmc1 in the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+ (Fig. 2). ATPase activities were determined by the release of γ-32P from [γ-32P]ATP. The rate of hydrolysis was 3-fold lower in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+ (kcat ∼ 0.32 ± 0.01 min-1) than in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ (kcat ∼1.05 ± 0.06 min-1). Importantly, we found that the ScDmc1 protein exhibited higher binding affinity for ATP in the presence of Ca2+ (Km = 0.34 ± 0.042 mm) than in the presence of Mg2+ (Km = 1.03 ± 0.10 mm). A low level of Ca2+ (0.1 mm) in the presence of 0.9 mm Mg2+ resulted in a significant increase in ATP binding (Km = 0.62 ± 0.10 mm) and a reduction in ATP hydrolysis (kcat ∼0.75 ± 0.06 min-1) as compared with 1 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 2). These results indicate that Ca2+ favors the formation and stability of Dmc1-ATP-ssDNA complexes. The results are in agreement with previous observations indicating that the active form of recombinase filaments is the ATP-bound form and that ATP hydrolysis is not required for homology searching or strand assimilation (8Hong E.L. Shinohara A. Bishop D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41906-41912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Yu X. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct.

Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Substituting ATP with AMP-PNP Does Not Enhance Strand Assimilation Efficiency in the Presence of Ca2+—Our previous work showed that, under conditions in which D-loop formation can be detected with Mg2+, the non-hydrolyzable analogue AMP-PNP yielded more products than ATP. For this reason we were interested in determining whether AMP-PNP and Ca2+ can stimulate D-loop activity independently. Under the increasing Ca2+ condition we found the same level of D-loop formation with Ca2+-ATP and Ca2+-AMP-PNP (Fig. 3). The absence of any additive effect on stimulation is consistent with the possibility that AMP-PNP stimulates D-loop activity by a mechanism shared with Ca2+. The most likely possibility is that this mechanism is the suppression of ATP hydrolysis. Although AMP-PNP can stimulate Dmc1 in the absence of Ca2+, this stimulation is not as efficient as that conferred by Ca2+. When divalent cation is increased to 10 mm during the targeting phase of the reaction, Mg2+ plus AMP-PNP yielded only one-third of the level of D-loops as that obtained with Ca2+ plus AMP-PNP or Ca2+-ATP. These results imply that Ca2+ can influence the efficiency of D-loop formation in a manner independent of its effect on ATP hydrolysis. This influence could be limited to the effect on nucleotide binding affinity described above. Alternatively, Ca2+ could also have a nucleotide-independent influence on Dmc1 assimilation activity. When divalency was retained at 1 mm during D-loop reactions, the difference between the two nucleotides was even more dramatic; AMP-PNP supported little or no D-loop formation even in the presence of Ca2+ Calcium Ion Promotes ScDmc1 Proteins to Form Extensive and Regular Helical Filaments with ssDNA—AFM-CNTs was used to examine the effect of Ca2+ on the structure of ScDmc1 filaments (Fig. 4A). We reported recently that the majority (∼90%) of ScDmc1 bound ssDNA as rings in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ plus AMP-PNP using the AFM-CNT imaging method (14Chang Y.C. Lo Y.H. Lee M.H. Leng C.H. Hu S.M. Chang C.S. Wang T.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6052-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, D-loop formation is extremely inefficient. In contrast, conditions that support a relatively high level of assimilation, 1 mm Ca2+ plus ATP, yielded nucleoprotein filaments with regular diagonal striations indicative of right-handed helical structure (Fig. 4B). Cross-section analysis was carried out by AFM-CNT method to determine both helical pitch and width (e.g. full width at the half-peak, FWHP) of the ScDmc1-(Ca2+-ATP)-ssDNA helical filaments (Fig. 5A). The FWHP of ScDmc1 helical filament (13.5 ± 0.8 nm) is slightly wider than that (12.3 ± 0.4 nm) of RecA-ssDNA filaments. As described previously (14Chang Y.C. Lo Y.H. Lee M.H. Leng C.H. Hu S.M. Chang C.S. Wang T.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6052-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the FWHP values of ssDNA and ScDmc1 ring-ssDNA were 6 and 18 nm, respectively. Fine ScDmc1 helical nucleoprotein filaments were also observed in the presence of Ca2+ 10 μm, 1 mm Mg2+, and 1 mm ATP (data not shown), indicating that low concentrations of Ca2+ can support formation of helices with the same helical pitches even when Mg2+ is in 100-fold excess. We conclude that Ca2+ promotes formation of helical filaments of ScDmc1 on ssDNA. This result supports the conclusion that Ca2+ stimulates Dmc1-dependent D-loop activity by promoting the formation of helical filaments. In cases where helical structure can be detected across a saturated nucleoprotein filament of known length, it is possible to calculate the number of nucleotides per helical turn of the filament (21Di Capua E. Engel A. Stasiak A. Koller T. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Three molecules were imaged in which the diagonal striations characteristic of helical structure could be seen across the entire length of the 872-nucleotide ssDNA molecule (Fig. 4, C-F). The three complete molecules contained 35, 38, and 40 striations. The contour length of these molecules was 465, 467, and 472 nm, respectively. Striation counts can only be taken to reflect helical stoichiometry if recombinase protomers do not extend past the end of the DNA. Given the similar contour lengths and narrow range of striation counts in the favorable molecules, we feel it is reasonable to assume that the extension of Dmc1 protomers beyond DNA ends was limited and/or did not occur for the three molecules examined. Under this assumption, the number of striations per DNA suggests that there are 24 ± 2 nucleotides per turn of the helical filament. This number is surprising in that RecA has been shown to bind 18 nucleotides per helical turn (21Di Capua E. Engel A. Stasiak A. Koller T. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 677-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The possible implications of this finding are discussed below. Data collected from the three molecules described above, as well as from an additional 12 molecules displaying substantial helical segments, were used to determine the average pitch of the helix. The helical pitch was found be 13.4 ± 2.5 nm (n = 171, Fig. 5B). This number suggests that the contour length of ssDNA in the helical Dmc1 filament is similar to that of a single strand in duplex DNA that is extended ∼1.6 ± 0.3-fold relative to B-form DNA. Consistent with this finding, the total length of 872-nucleotide ScDmc1-Ca2+, the ATP-ssDNA helical filaments, is 468 ± 2 nm. The degree of DNA extension seen for Dmc1-ssDNA filaments is identical to that reported previously for RecA (21Di Capua E. Engel A. Stasiak A. Koller T. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 677-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and was confirmed by us using the same AFM conditions identical to those for ScDmc1. 4Y.-C. Chang, C.-S. Chang, and T.-F. Wang, unpublished observations. Thus, Dmc1 and RecA appeared to extend ssDNA by about the same amount but underwind it to different degrees, namely Dmc1 to 24 nucleotides per turn and RecA to 18 nucleotides per turn (21Di Capua E. Engel A. Stasiak A. Koller T. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 677-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The results described above contribute to the unifying view that all recombinases of the RecA family function as right-handed helices on ssDNA and argues strongly against the proposal that Dmc1 D-loops via a toroid-mediated interaction. Ca2+ promoted ScDmc1 helical filament formation and D-loop activity. From this result, we speculate that the presence or absence of Ca2+ in reagents (e.g. ATP-regenerating systems, buffers, and salts) used in previous reports (6Masson J.Y. Davies A.A. Hajibagheri N.

Nature. 2004; 429: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) may explain (at least partially) why purified HsDmc1 from different laboratories behaved differently. A very recent report on the human Dmc1 protein supports this notion (see below) (23Bugreev D.V. Golub E.I. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26886-26895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Ca2+ also activates HsRad51 (24Bugreev D.V. Mazin A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9988-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and its accessory protein HsRad54 (25Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), indicating that Ca2+ could be a general modulator for DNA exchange promoted by both yeast and mammalian homologous recombination proteins. However, there is obvious similarity between Rad51 and Dmc1 in that in both cases the ATPase activity is lower in Ca2+ than in Mg2+. For filaments in which it was possible to count helical turns across the entire length of a coated DNA, we calculated a stoichiometry of ∼24 nucleotides per helical turn. This finding differs from values obtained for RecA, which binds 18 nucleotides per helical turn. RecA filaments have six protomers per turn and, hence, three nucleotides per protomer (21Di Capua E. Engel A. Stasiak A. Koller T. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 677-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the higher ratio reflects helical assembly of Dmc1 beyond DNA ends, the value suggests two interesting alternative possibilities. First, it is possible that there are eight Dmc1 protomers per helical turn. This possibility seems concordant with the fact that Dmc1 forms octameric rings, whereas the rings formed by RecA and Rad51 are hexamers (6Masson J.Y. Davies A.A. Hajibagheri N. Dyck Van E.

Our finding that the width of Dmc1 filaments was slightly greater than that of RecA filaments viewed under the same conditions is also consistent with the idea that there are more monomers per turn, especially given the pitch of the Dmc1 filament (Fig. 3). Alternatively, it is possible that ScDmc1 filaments contain six protomers per turn, with each protomer binding four rather than three nucleotides. Studies of Dmc1 binding do not reliably distinguish between the possibilities of three versus four nucleotides per monomer (8Hong E.L. Shinohara A. Bishop D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41906-41912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although we favor the first possibility, further work is required to fully define the structure of Dmc1 helical filaments on DNA. Finally, a previous study showed that Ca2+ ion influx occurs during budding yeast meiosis (26Suizu T. Tsutsumi H. Kawado A. Suginami K. Imayasu S. Murata K. Can. J. Microbiol. 1995; 41: 1035-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Given this finding, the results presented here raise the intriguing possibility that the progress of meiotic recombination reactions is controlled by changes in intracellular calcium levels. Addendum—Following initial submission of this manuscript we became aware of independent work on human Dmc1 protein by A. V. Mazin and colleagues (23Bugreev D.V. Golub E.I. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26886-26895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These investigators showed that, like the protein from budding yeast, the ability of human Dmc1 to form helical filaments and D-loops is stimulated by calcium. It appears therefore that the influence of calcium on Dmc1 structure and function is a conserved feature of the protein. We thank Tobin R. Sosnick for help with analysis of kinetic data."

We find that AFP gene expression is repressed by the TP53 family member p73 during normal hepatic development and when p73α or p73β is introduced into cultured hepatoma cells that express AFP. Transient co-transfection of p53 family members showed that p53 and transactivating (TA)-p73, but not TA-p63, repress endogenous AFP transcription additively or independently. p53-independent functions of p73 are further supported by delayed, p73-associated compensation of AFP repression during development of the p53-null mouse. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of normal and p53-null mouse liver tissue showed that TA-p73 binds at a previously identified p53 repressor site (-860/-830) within the distal promoter of AFP at a level equivalent to p53 in wild type liver, with increased binding of TA-p73 to chromatin in the absence of p53. Sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that TA-p73 and p53 bind simultaneously to their shared regulatory site in wild type liver. Like the founding family member p53, TA-p73 represses AFP expression by chromatin structure alteration, targeting reduction of acetylated histone H3 lysine 9 and increased dimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 levels. However, chromatin-bound TA-p73 is associated with elevated di- and tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 4 levels in p53-null liver and hepatoma cells, concomitant with a reduced ability to repress transcription compared with p53.

In the absence of p73 expression, mice exhibit neural defects and problems in inflammatory response and pheromone detection (1Melino G. Lu X. Gasco M. Crook T. Knight R.A. Trends Biochem.

Recently, loss of p63 and/or p73 has been shown to predispose mice toward the development of specific, spontaneous tumors. Mice, which are heterozygous for p53 loss and either p63 or p73+/-, have a higher tumor burden compared with p53+/- mice. Interestingly, 15% of p53+/-,p73+/- mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but none of the mice heterozygous for p53, p63, or p73 alone nor any of the p53+/-,p63+/- mice displayed HCC (18Flores E.R.

These findings suggest that members of the p53 superfamily have tissue-specific functions in regulation of gene expression and tumor suppression, in addition to any overlapping activities caused by conservation of sequence and structure (9Yang A. Kaghad M. Caput D. McKeon F. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 90-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). We have focused on transcription repression of the HCC-associated tumor marker AFP as a model for p53 function during development of the liver. AFP is highly expressed during fetal liver development but is rapidly repressed within a few weeks after birth. Expression of AFP in adult liver is reactivated only in cases of renewed cellular proliferation, as occurs during liver regeneration and HCC (19Tilghman S.M. Belayew A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5254-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Tilghman S.M. Oxf. Surv. Eukaryot. Genes. 1985; 2: 160-206PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, aberrant expression of AFP protein during HCC induces apoptosis of dendritic cells, and studies of patients with HCC show that levels of serum AFP are inversely proportional to tumor necrosis factor-α production (21Um S.H. Mulhall C. Alisa A. Ives A.R. Karani J. Williams R. Bertoletti A. Behboudi S. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1772-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The tumor spectrum of mice mutant for p53 and p73, a large proportion of which develop HCC, as well as the association of aberrant AFP production and dysfunction in immune response, suggested a possible role for p73 in repression of AFP. Expression of AFP is sustained developmentally in p53-null mouse liver compared with WT but declines to undetectable levels by 4 months of age (22Nguyen T.T. Cho K. Stratton S.A. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This alteration in the time course of AFP repression during liver development led us to consider that members of the p53 superfamily might compensate for the loss of p53 function and act in transcription repression of AFP. In this study, we found that AFP gene expression is regulated by both p53 and p73, but not p63, independently as well as additively. ChIP and Re-ChIP analysis of wild type mouse liver tissue revealed simultaneous occupancy of the p53/p73 regulatory element by p53 and TA-p73, concomitant with developmental repression of AFP expression. Within p53-null mouse liver, TA-p73 binds chromatin at the AFP p53 regulatory element at a time of delayed repression of AFP during development. TA-p73 is a less effective repressor of transcription, targeting only a subset of the co-repressor proteins and histone modifications associated with p53-mediated repression of transcription. Our data support a model of additive p53 and p73 function in direct developmental repression of transcription, which in the absence of p53 is compromised but not lost. Cell Culture and Plasmids—Hepa1-6, mouse hepatoma cells, and Hep3B, a human hepatoma cell line, were obtained from ATCC and cultured under standard, suggested conditions.

Quantifying RNA Levels—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells, C3H Δ10, and C57/B6 WT and p53-/- mouse livers using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized with the SuperScript first strand system (Invitrogen) using 2 μg of total RNA as template and oligo(dT) as primer. Murine AFP (forward primer, 5′-CCCACTTCCAGCACTGCCTGCGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGCTGCAGCAGCCTGAGAGTC-3′) and murine GAPDH (forward primer, 5′-TTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′; reverse primer 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGA-3′) oligonucleotides were used separately in both semi-quantitative and real time PCR. Oligonucleotides for amplification of human AFP (forward primer, 5′-GCTGACCTGGCTACCATATT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTGCAGAGTCTGAATGTCC-3′) and human GAPDH (forward primer, 5′-TCTCATGGTTCACCCATGACGAACATG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AAGAAGATGCGGCTGACTGTCGAGCCACAT-3′) were used in semi-quantitative PCR. To distinguish the AFP minigene transcript from endogenous AFP, minigene primers bridging the third and fourteenth exons were used (forward primer, 5′-AAGCCACCGAGGAGGAAG-3′; reverse primer 5′-TTAAACGCCCAAAGCATCAC-3′). PCR products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and stained with SYBR-Green dye. Real time PCR was performed in 25-μl reaction volumes containing iQ SYBR-Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 200 nm of each primer, and 1 μl cDNA using the iCycler iQ real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). PCR cycle parameters were: 3 min at 95 °C, 50 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C, followed by melting curve analysis.

Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Liver tissue from C57BL/6J WT and p53-/-, as well as C3H Δ10 mice (29Jin D.K. Feuerman M.H. Somat. Cell. Mol. Genet. 1996; 22: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), was used for ChIP assays. Antibody sources: anti-p73 (H-79, 15 μl; Santa Cruz), p53 (Ab1 OP03, 15 μl; Oncogene), normal sheep IgG (12-369, 5 μl; Upstate Cell Signaling Technologies), acetylated histone H3 lysine 9 (AcH3K9) (06-942, 5 μl; Upstate Cell Signaling Technologies), dimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (DiMetH3K9) (07-212, 5 μl; Upstate Cell Signaling Technologies), dimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (DiMetH3K4) (07-030, 5 μl; Upstate Cell Signaling Technologies), trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (TriMetH3K4) (ab8580-50, 5 μl; Abcam), and histone H3 (ab1791-100, 10 μl, Abcam). 3 μg of each antibody were added to the reactions and incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with 40 μl of protein A/G beads (preblocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.3 mg/ml of salmon sperm DNA). PCR primer sequences are as follows: the AFP SBE/p53RE region of -887 to -762 (forward primer, TAAAAAATAAACTCAACTACATATG; reverse primer, GAAAACTTTTAAAACTTCCC), the AFP start site region of -82 to +94 (forward primer, CATATGTTTGCTCACTGAAGGTTAC; reverse primer, CGCAGCGAAATGTAGCAGGAGGA), the Albumin enhancer region of 151 bp, 11 kb upstream of the transcription start site (forward primer, GGGACGAGATGTACTTTGTG; reverse primer, GATCAGTCCAAACTTCTTTCTG), the Brn-3b region from 151 bp 5′ of the stop codon to 186 bp downstream (forward primer, TCTGGAAGCCTACTTCGCCA; reverse primer, CCGGTTCACAATCTCTCTGA), and for transgene analysis of -1100 to -800 (forward primer, TATGAACTAGGTTTGATCG; reverse primer, TCTGTGTGTCATATTGGAT. To ensure that the PCRs were in linear range, several serial dilutions of the input DNA and two dilutions of each of the bound DNA fractions were used to quantify products (data not shown). PCR products were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels and stained with Sybr Green (Sigma). DNA bands were visualized and quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 and NIH Image 1.63 software. We used an antibody that recognizes the C-terminal tail of histone H3 (Abcam), which is not modification-specific, as an internal control to normalize recovery of chromatin in the preparation of each lysate. The percentage of input bound was calculated by dividing the value of the bound fraction by the average of values for the input dilutions in the linear range and multiplying by the respective dilution factor. If any signal was present in the IgG negative control, this background level of precipitation was subtracted from the total percentage of input bound. Quantifications from multiple individual experiments were taken, and the average values were plotted graphically using Microsoft Excel software. The error bars represent the standard deviation. Re-ChIP of Chromatin-bound Proteins—Precipitated complexes were eluted from primary immunoprecipitates, pooled from three or four reactions, and incubated with 30 μl of ChIP elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS). The samples were shaken for 30 min at room temperature, then spun down, and collected as supernatants. The complexes were eluted twice, and both elutions were combined. The pooled elutions were diluted 1:10 in buffer (1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Further Re-ChIP of supernatants and analysis of the results were performed as described above for primary ChIP immunoprecipitations. AFP Gene Expression Is Repressed by Expression of p73—Transcription of p63 and p73 from upstream or downstream promoters generates protein variants with extended N termini, containing TA domains or N-terminal deleted forms (ΔN) that may interact with TA isoforms to alter their function or display their own regulatory effects (1Melino G. Lu X. Gasco M. Crook T. Knight R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 663-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 2Moll U.M. Slade N. Mol.

To examine qualitatively the effects of p73 and p63 expression on endogenous AFP expression, cultured hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with the TA isoform p73α, p73β, p63α, or p63γ expression vectors (Fig. 1). Overexpression of either TA-p73 isoform led to a decrease in AFP RNA and protein levels in p53+, mouse Hepa1-6 (Fig. 1, A and B) and p53-, human Hep3B cells (Fig. 1, C-E). These representative data show that both TA-p73 isoforms equivalently repress AFP expression, independently of p53 status or specific cell background, and establish cause and effect between p73 expression and AFP regulation. In contrast to p73, neither p63 isoform had an effect on AFP expression in the mouse or human hepatoma cell lines (Fig. 1, B, D, and E). The ability to activate p21 in other cell types has been previously shown for transactivating isoforms of p63 and p73 (30Dietz S. Rother K. Bamberger C. Schmale H. Mossner J. Engeland K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31De Laurenzi V. Melino G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 926: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we find that both p63α and γ activated transcription of endogenous p21 in mouse and human hepatoma cells, as did p73 (Fig. 1, B and D). Co-expression of p53 and p73 had no combinatorial effect when p53 was expressed at high levels and repression of AFP may have been maximal (Fig. 2A). However, when p53 expression was reduced, introduction of p73 had an additive, dose-dependent effect on repression of AFP RNA and protein expression (Fig. 2, B and C). We conclude that p53 and TA-p73 repress AFP transcription independently and additively, but TA-p73 function can be masked by the more effective transcription regulator p53. Previously, we showed that endogenous p53 could be activated in Hepa1-6 cells by exposure to actinomycin D, concomitant with sequence-specific repression of AFP and induction of p21 protein levels (25Lee K.C. Crowe A.J. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Likewise, the addition of transforming growth factor-β1 ligand led to repression of AFP transcription and increased association of endogenous p53 with an overlapping Smad-binding element/p53 regulatory element (SBE/p53RE). Interaction of p53 with chromatin increased 4-fold at this site, although detectable levels of bound p53 were present even in the absence of transforming growth factor-β1 ligand addition (28Wilkinson D.S. Ogden S.K. Stratton S.A. Piechan J.L. Nguyen T.T. Smulian G.A. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1200-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We explored the mechanism of p73-mediated repression using ChIP analysis of Hepa1-6 cells. We found that p73 binding at the SBE/p53RE repression of AFP did not occur unless p73-encoding plasmids were introduced by transfection (Fig. 3A). Overexpressed TA-p73 protein bound specifically to the SBE/p53RE region, but to no other sites within the distal or proximal promoter (data not shown). The downstream effects of exogenous TA-p73 expression were monitored by ChIP analysis of histone modifications present at the SBE/p53RE (repressor region, -887 to -827) and core promoter (start site, -82 to +94) of AFP. Expression of either isoform of TA-p73 (p73α and β) led to loss of acetylation and increased methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), which are both correlated with repressed chromatin. Decreased trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4) is another alteration generally associated with repression of transcription; however, p73 expression induced no change in H3K4 trimethylation at the core promoter and a slight decrease at the repressor region of AFP. Immunoblot analysis of Hepa1-6 lysates showed that endogenous p53 but not TA-p73 was readily detectable (Fig. 3B). However, immunoprecipitation analysis of endogenous p53 and p73 revealed that heteromeric complexes of p53 and p73 formed within Hepa1-6 cells but likely represent only a fraction of the endogenous p53-protein complexes. Further support for the formation of p53·p73 protein complexes, as well as p53·protein complexes lacking p73, and their ability to bind the SBE/p53RE of AFP was supplied by in vitro protein-DNA binding analyses using electromobility shift assays (Fig. 3C). Equal concentration of proteins present in lysates of Hepa1-6 cells, transfected with vector only (lanes 1 and 6), p73α only (lanes 2 and 4), p73β only (lanes 3 and 5),or a combination of these p73 isoforms and p53 (lanes 7-10), were incubated with radiolabeled, double-stranded oligomers containing the SBE/p53RE (-860/-830). Protein·SBE/p53RE complexes were apparent only when exogenous proteins were expressed and were specifically competed by 50-fold excess of unlabeled SBE/p53RE oligonucleotides (lanes 4, 5, 9, and 10). One major protein·DNA complex formed in the presence of either p73α or β, but multiple protein·DNA complexes were apparent when both p53 and either TA-p73 isoform were expressed (lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8). Association of p73 and p53 with Chromatin Correlates with Developmental Repression of AFP—Recently we exploited ChIP analysis of solid tissues to show that p53 associates specifically with an SBE/p53RE within the AFP distal promoter (-860/-830) when AFP is repressed during hepatic development (22Nguyen T.T. Cho K. Stratton S.A. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DNA affinity purification of adult mouse liver nuclear extracts and ChIP analyses of liver tissue show that effectors of transforming growth factor-β signaling, Smads 2/4 and SnoN proteins, interact with the SBE/p53RE to repress AFP transcription cooperatively with p53. In the absence of p53 protein, SnoN binding to the SBE/p53RE is considerably compromised in vivo and in vitro (28Wilkinson D.S. Ogden S.K. Stratton S.A. Piechan J.L. Nguyen T.T. Smulian G.A. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1200-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ChIP analysis of p53-null mouse liver tissue revealed that mSin3a and histone deacetylase 1 also interacted at this site in a p53-dependent manner to effect histone deacetylation, in parallel with increased H3K9 methylation and decreased di- and trimethylated H3K4 (22Nguyen T.T. Cho K. Stratton S.A. Barton M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We used this approach to determine whether endogenous TA-p73 interacts with the SBE/p53RE of AFP in adult liver, where AFP expression is fully repressed. Immunoblot analysis of extracts isolated from adult mouse liver (2 months of age), Hepa1-6 and HeLa cells was performed for p53, TA-p73, and p63 (Fig. 4A). Levels of p53 in normal mouse liver are very low but detectable (lane 1). As observed in numerous tumor-derived cell lines, p53 protein is stabilized in Hepa1-6 and undetectable (at the appropriate molecular mass) in HeLa cells (lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, there is an inverse relationship between levels of p53 and p73 detected in normal liver cells, compared with tumor-derived, hepatoma cells (lanes 1 and 2). A prominent band, revealed by the p73-specific antibody, migrates at a molecular mass greater than 110 kDa, which may be the sumoylated form of p73α reported previously (32Minty A. Dumont X. Kaghad M. Caput D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The p63 protein is expressed at undetectable levels in normal liver tissue, as previously reported (33Petitjean A. Cavard C. Shi H. Tribollet V. Hainaut P. Caron de Fromentel C.

The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) 2The abbreviations used are:ENaCepithelial Na+ channelCHOChinese hamster ovaryMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasehENaChuman epithelial Na+ channel is localized to the luminal plasma membrane of epithelial cells, particularly those involved in fluid absorption and epithelia surface hydration (1Kellenberger S.

As a consequence of this location and its function, ENaC activity is often limiting for Na+ absorption with corresponding effects on fluid movement. The critical role played by ENaC in terrestrial vertebrates has become apparent through investigation of diseases resulting from loss and gain of function mutations in this ion channel and its upstream regulators. Loss of function mutations result in inappropriate renal salt wasting in humans associated with electrolyte imbalance and decreased blood pressure (4Bonny O. Hummler E.

ENaC subunits, similar to all members of the ENaC/Deg superfamily, have a common tertiary structure: two transmembrane domains separating a large extracellular loop from cytosolic NH2 and COOH termini. ENaC activity reflects, in part, the membrane levels of this ion channel. All three ENaC subunits, α, β, and γ, contain a conserved PY motif (XPPXY) in their COOH termini (13Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.

This motif interacts with WW-domains, particularly, those in ubiquitin ligases, such as Nedd4 and Nedd4-2. Ubiquitinylation mediated by ubiquitin ligases targets proteins for internalization and/or degradation. The interaction of Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases with ENaC leads to ubiquitinylation of the channel with corresponding decreases in channel membrane levels and activity (15Staub O. Abriel H. Plant P.

Overlapping the PY motif in each of the three ENaC subunits is a putative tyrosine-based (YXXϕ, where ϕ represents a residue with a hydrophobic side chain) endocytic/trafficking signal.

These investigators demonstrated that co-expression of dominant-negative dynamin with ENaC increases channel activity. Dynamin is a GTPase that promotes budding of clathrin-coated vesicles. Whereas PY and YXXϕ motifs are common tyrosine-based sorting signals found in the cytosolic domains of many integral membrane proteins, they are infrequently found in the same protein (22Trowbridge I.S.

When a protein does contain both types of sorting signals, they are most often separated in the linear amino acid sequence. However, several channel subunits, including ENaC subunits, α-subunits of voltage-gated Na channels (Nav), β-subunits (barttin) of voltage-gated Cl- channels, connexin 43, and some ether-a-go-go-related gene K+ channel subunits, contain a conserved domain, XPPXYXXϕ, encompassing overlapping PY and YXXϕ motifs (14Rotin D.

It currently is unclear if such overlapping sorting motifs function together as a single unit or whether each distinct motif has discrete and thus, separable function.

We test here whether these conserved Ser/Thr differentially modulate ENaC activity and responses to proteins involved in trafficking. The current results are most consistent with the overlapping motifs in ENaC being capable of acting, in some instances, in a modular manner to regulate channel activity with the conserved Ser/Thr preceding and embedded with the PY and YXXϕ motifs, respectively, differentially impacting discrete internalization/degradation mechanisms, or discrete steps within a single mechanism.

For precipitation experiments, α-mENaC containing both an NH2-terminal Myc and extracellular His6 tag was used. The plasmid encoding the fusion protein of hSOS and the COOH terminus of γ-mENaC (γA568-end) has been described previously (35Booth R.E. Tong Q. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol.

Truncation, deletion, and substitution mutagenesis of plasmids encoding ENaC and hSOS-γA568-end-mENaC were performed using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Mutants used in the current study included the truncation and deletion derivatives γ637X and γΔS613-R632, respectively, of hSOS-γA568-end-mENaC. Alanine substitutions at Thr635 were subsequently engineered into both derivatives. In addition, T628A was engineered into the truncation derivative. For electrophysiology, T628A and T635A were engineered individually and jointly in γ-mENaC. We also engineered the T635D and Glu mutations into wild-type and T628A backgrounds.

In brief, S. cerevisiae cdc25H yeast transformed with pSOS-ENaC constructs were plated on SD/glucose (-Leu) agar at 24 °C. Colonies were developed for 4 days after which they were patched from the source plate in duplicate onto SD/glucose (-Leu) plates to create two identical arrays. Arrays were grown in parallel at permissive (24 °C) and restrictive (37 °C) temperatures. Colony growth on these experimental plates was then quantified after 2 days. Cdc25 is the yeast homologue of hSOS and is required for Ras-dependent growth. The yeast strain used in the current study has temperature-sensitive cdc25 that is not functional at restrictive temperatures (37 °C). Because pSOS encodes a truncated hSOS incapable of membrane localization by itself, recombinant hSOS-ENaC fusion proteins only activate Ras signaling and thus, promote yeast growth to complement when localized to the plasma membrane by information within the ENaC portion of the fusion protein. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis of hSOS-ENaC hybrids followed standard procedures (35Booth R.E. Tong Q. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol.

In brief, inoculates of single yeast colonies were developed at 24 °C in 10 ml of SD/glucose (-L) broth for 2-3 days (A600 > 1.0). Yeast whole cell extract was prepared by lysing in (in mm) 140 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 10 Na2HPO4, 1.8 KH2PO4, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (for fungal and yeast cells; Sigma). Lysate proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (on 7% gels) with proteins transferred to nitrocellulose blotted with anti-SOS antibody.

In brief, COS-7 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged β- and γ- and Myc, His6-tagged α-ENaC. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were extracted in gentle lysis buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40), cleared, and normalized for total protein concentration. His-tagged ENaC (in 400 μl of whole cell lysate at 1 μg/μl total protein concentration) was precipitated with pre-equilibrated ProBond nickel-chelating resin (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C. Precipitated ENaC was washed 5 times with 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0). ENaC was eluted from resin with 250 mm imidazole and 20 mm dithiothreitol in SDS sample buffer heated at 85 °C for 10 min. ENaC and associated proteins were separated with SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-Myc and anti-AP50 antibodies in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 5% dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20. Electrophysiology—Whole cell macroscopic current recordings of recombinant mENaC expressed in CHO cells were made under voltage-clamp conditions using standard methods (31Tong Q. Stockand J.D. Am. J.

Current through ENaC was the inward, amiloride-sensitive Na+ current with an extracellular bath solution of (in mm) 160 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), and an intracellular pipette solution of (in mm) 120 CsCl, 5 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), 2.0 ATP, and 0.1 GTP. Current recordings were acquired with an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) interfaced via a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments) to a PC running the pClamp 9 suite of software (Axon Instruments). Both a family of test pulses (500 ms each) stepping by 20-mV increments form a holding potential of 40 to 100 mV to -120 mV and voltage ramps (500 ms) from 60 to -100 mV were used to measure ENaC activity. Statistics—Complementation frequency was compared using a z-test on proportions. All patch clamp data are presented as mean ± S.E. Unpaired data were compared using the appropriate t tests. p < 0.05 was considered significant. ENaC Activity Is Differentially Modulated by Thr613 and Thr620, and Thr628 and Thr635 in β- and γ-mENaC, Respectively—Fig. 1A shows an alignment of the area including the overlapping PY and putative YXXϕ motifs for mENaC subunits, as well as similar motifs conserved in the cytosolic COOH termini of Nav1, Kv11, barttin, and connexin 43 channel subunits. Residue numbering is for γ-mENaC. Of particular interest in the current study are the conserved Ser/Thr residues just preceding and within the PY and YXXϕ motifs. To test whether these Ser/Thr influence ENaC activity, we assayed activity of wild-type and mutant ENaC heterologously expressed in CHO cells under voltage clamp conditions. Typical macroscopic current traces for wild-type mENaC before and after (noted with arrow) amiloride are shown in the top current traces in Fig. 1B. The middle and bottom current traces in Fig. 1B are from cells co-expressing wild-type α- and β-subunits with γ-subunits containing the T628A and the T635A substitutions, respectively. As shown in the summary graph in Fig. 1C, which reports mean amiloride-sensitive current density at -80 mV, substitution of the former threonine had little effect on steady-state activity. In contrast, substitution of the latter threonine, Thr635, significantly increased ENaC activity. Thus, the γT628A and γT635A substitutions have differential effects on the activity of recombinant mENaC expressed in CHO cells with the latter but not former increasing activity. Similar studies were performed on channels containing β-subunits with alanine substitutions of the corresponding Ser/Thr preceding (T613A) and within (T620A) the PY and YXXϕ motifs, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1D, substitution of Thr613 but not Thr620 significantly increased steady-state activity. Similar to γ-ENaC, mutation of the conserved Ser/Thr preceding and within the PY and YXXϕ motifs of β-ENaC resulted in differential effects on activity. However, the Ser/Thr preceding the PY motif in β-, in contrast to γ-ENaC, increased activity, whereas, the Ser/Thr embedded within the YXXϕ motif in γ- but not β-ENaC increased activity. Dynamin, Nedd4-2, and Epsin Modulate ENaC—The consensus for Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 regulation of ENaC is that these ubiquitin ligases decrease channel activity by decreasing channel membrane levels (40Snyder P.M.

The effects of dominant-negative dynamin on ENaC activity have also been previously studied (21Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Co-expression of dominant-negative dynamin increases channel activity. Possible effects on ENaC by epsin, which is a clathrin-binding adaptor protein that also contains an ubiquitin-interacting motif (44Wendland B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Fig. 2A shows representative families of macroscopic currents before and after amiloride (right) from untransfected CHO cells and cells expressing wild-type hENaC in the absence and presence of co-expression of dynamin and dominant-negative (K44A) dynamin. Fig. 2B summarizes results from such experiments. As expected, dominant-negative dynamin significantly increased hENaC activity. As shown in Fig. 2C (see also TABLE ONE), mENaC had a similar response with dominant-negative dynamin significantly increasing activity. Also shown in Fig. 2C are the effects of co-expression of Nedd4-2 (N4-2) and epsin on mENaC activity. Co-expression of Nedd4-2, as expected, significantly decreased ENaC activity. Co-expression of epsin with ENaC, similar to Nedd4-2 and in contrast to dominant-negative dynamin, significantly decreased channel activity. These results demonstrate that the activity of wild-type ENaC heterologously expressed in CHO cells is increased and decreased when proteins involved in endocytosis and/or transit to the late endosome, lysosome, and proteosome are disrupted and overexpressed, respectively.TABLE ONERegulation of wild-type and mutant ENaC by Nedd4-2, dominant-negative dynamin, and epsin Activities are amiloride-sensitive current densities at -80 mV in pA/pF.

Although the direct effects of cations on caspase-3 activity have been examined, comparable studies on procaspase-3 are lacking. In addition, the effects of salts on caspase structure have not been examined. We have studied the effects of cations on the activities and conformations of caspase-3 and an uncleavable mutant of procaspase-3 that is enzymatically active. The results show that caspase-3 is more sensitive to changes in pH and ion concentrations than is the zymogen. This is due to the loss of both an intact intersubunit linker and the prodomain. The results show that, although the caspase-3 subunits reassemble to the heterotetramer, the activity return is low after the protein is incubated at or below pH 4.5 and then returned to pH 7.5. The data further show that the irreversible step in assembly results from heterotetramer rather than heterodimer dissociation and demonstrate that the active site does not form properly following reassembly. However, active-site formation is fully reversible when reassembly occurs in the presence of the prodomain, and this effect is specific for the propeptide of caspase-3. The data show that the prodomain facilitates both dimerization and active-site formation in addition to stabilizing the native structure. Overall, the results show that the prodomain acts as an intramolecular chaperone during assembly of the (pro)caspase subunits and increases the efficiency of formation of the native conformation.

Apoptosis is a type of cell death that occurs in eumetazoans, is responsible for maintaining the balance between cell growth and death, and can occur via two major pathways (1Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). The extrinsic pathway occurs in response to death receptor ligation (2Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rouke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar) and results in a cascade of limited proteolytic cleavages by upstream activator caspases that ultimately lead to the activation of the executioner caspase-3. The intrinsic pathway triggers the release of ATP and cytochrome c from the mitochondria in response to antineoplastic drugs (3Fearnhead H.O. McCurrach M.E. O'Neill J. Zhang K. Lowe S.W. Lazebnik Y.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1266-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), growth factor withdrawal (4Deckwerth T.L. Johnson Jr., E.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 679: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), or ionizing radiation (5Datta R. Banach D. Kojima H. Talanian R.V. Alnemri E.S. Wong W.W. Kufe D.W. Blood. 1996; 88: 1936-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway results in a proteolytic cascade that activates caspase-9 and, subsequently, caspase-3 (6Segal M.S. Beem E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1196-C1204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both pathways give rise to the proteolysis of structural and protective components of the cell, which in turn leads to the coordinated disassembly of the cell (7Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). A relatively well characterized event leading up to the commitment to apoptosis is the change in the ionic homeostasis of the cell. Apoptotic cells are generally characterized as having low [K+]i, normal to slightly increased [Na+]i, high [H+]i, and normal to moderately increased [Ca2+]i. The efflux of potassium (leading to the depletion of intracellular potassium) is a key early step in apoptosis (8Yu S.P. Prog. Neurobiol. (N. Y.). 2003; 70: 363-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, [K+]i is ∼140 mm, and levels decrease to <50 mm in apoptotic cells (9Yu S.P. Canzoniero L.M.T. Choi D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 10Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1999; 39: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The decrease in [K+]i and associated water movement are contributing factors to the change in cell volume observed during apoptosis. Normal potassium concentrations are inhibitory to apoptosis and may act by inhibiting an apoptotic nuclease, NUC18 (10Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1999; 39: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition, normal potassium levels inhibit the cytochrome c-dependent activation of procaspase-3, but do not inhibit the activity of caspase-3 (6Segal M.S. Beem E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1196-C1204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bilney A.J. Murray A.W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although free potassium is a major contributor to intracellular ionic strength, Hughes and Cidlowski (10Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1999; 39: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) showed that substitution of potassium with other monovalent ions results in similar effects. This indicates that the response is not specific to potassium cations, but is instead controlled by the ionic strength. Thus far, potassium is the only cation that has been described as having a role in the inhibition of apoptosis, although studies of the direct effects of cations on caspase-3 activation and apoptotic commitment are incomplete at best. Although the results are less clear, studies with other ions, such as magnesium, zinc, copper, and iron, show that these ions also may have a role in apoptosis in certain tissues (reviewed in Ref. 9Yu S.P. Canzoniero L.M.T. Choi D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In most cases, the effects of changes in ionic homeostasis occur at a stage prior to the maturation of caspase-3 and, in some cases, may result from the prevention of the formation of the apoptosome. For example, fluctuations in ion levels may inhibit the expression of caspase-9 as well as prevent the recruitment of caspase-9 to the apoptosome (6Segal M.S. Beem E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1196-C1204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Putney and co-workers (12Bian X. Hughes Jr., F.M. Huang Y. Cidlowski J.A. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1241-C1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors initiate apoptosis by decreasing [Ca2+]i, and Segal and Beem (6Segal M.S. Beem E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1196-C1204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated a 50% inhibition of caspase activity in cytosolic extracts with ∼60 mm CaCl2. However, Stennicke and Salvesen (13Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) found that calcium has no effect on caspase-3 activity at 100 mm and suggested that the effects of calcium on apoptosis are unlikely to be due to an effect on caspases. In contrast, the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by caspase-3 has been shown to be inhibited by zinc at concentrations as low as 0.1 mm (14Perry D.K. Smyth M.J. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 18530-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Although studies of the direct effects of cations on caspase-3 activity remain incomplete, comparable studies on the activity of procaspase-3 are lacking. Until recently, procaspase-3 was thought to be enzymatically inactive; thus, studies of the effects of ions on procaspase activity were not warranted. Recently, however, it was shown by Nicholson and co-workers (15Roy S. Bayly C.I. Gareau Y. Houtzager V.M. Kargman S. Keen S.L.C. Rowland K. Seiden I.M. Thornberry N.A. Nicholson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98 (S. L. C.): 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) that an uncleavable procaspase-3 mutant contains catalytic activity. In this mutant, the three processing sites (Asp9, Asp28, and Asp175) have been replaced with glutamate. Likewise, we showed previously that a procaspase-3 mutant with the processing sites replaced with alanine is active (see Fig. 1) (16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the maturation of procaspase-3, the cleavage at Asp175 separates the large and small subunits and results in a large increase in activity, whereas the cleavages at Asp9 and Asp28 remove the prodomain (17Denault J.-B. Salvesen G.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4489-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). We further showed that the uncleavable procaspase is ∼200-fold less active than mature caspase-3 and that the lower activity is a result of a low catalytic efficiency rather than a difference in substrate binding (16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the effects of physiologically relevant salts on the activity of procaspase-3 and the accompanying changes in the active-site environment. In addition, it has been noted that the procaspase-3 homodimer is more stable than the caspase-3 heterotetramer between pH 4 and 7 (18Feeney B. Pop C. Tripathy A. Clark A.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Bose K. Clark A.C. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), although it is not clear whether this is due to the presence of the propeptide or to an intact intersubunit linker in the procaspase. Indeed, Denault and Salvesen (20Denault J.-B. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34042-34050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) showed that the propeptide of caspase-7 plays a role in stabilizing the zymogen and alters the properties of procaspase-7 as a substrate for caspase-7. By analogy, the lower stability of caspase-3 may be due to the loss of the propeptide upon maturation. We investigated whether the prodomain or the intact intersubunit linker affects dimer stability, and we further investigated the roles that salts and pH play in the stability of the (pro)caspase-3 dimer. Based on the results, we propose a model for the salt- and propeptide-dependent assembly of the caspase subunits. Materials—Caspase-3, -6, and -7 prodomains were synthesized by the Peptide Facility at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC). Sodium chloride, ammonium chloride, Tris base, and β-mercaptoethanol were from Fisher. Zinc chloride, magnesium chloride, dithiothreitol (DTT), 2The abbreviations used are: DTTdithiothreitolCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropy-l)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidprocaspase-3(D3A)procaspase-3(D9A,D28A,D175A)PIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidIMCsintramolecular chaperones. sodium citrate, and monobasic and dibasic potassium phosphate were from Sigma. Potassium chloride and sucrose were from Mallinckrodt Chemical Works. Calcium chloride was from Acros Organics.

Mutagenesis—A mutation was introduced into the background of pro-less caspase-3 using the template pHC329 (21Pop C. Chen Y.-R. Smith B. Bose K. Bobay B. Tripathy A. Franzen S. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14224-14235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the D175A forward and reverse primers (referred to as primers 1 and 2) as described previously (16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This generated plasmid pHC32902 and produces an uncleavable pro-less procaspase-3 with the D175A mutation. In this mutant, the N-terminal 28 amino acids were replaced previously with methionine (21Pop C. Chen Y.-R. Smith B. Bose K. Bobay B. Tripathy A. Franzen S. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14224-14235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Construction of plasmid pHC33209, which produces procaspase-3(D9A,D28A,D175A), was described previously (16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The D9A,D28A double mutant was produced using the template pHC33209 and primer 1 (5′-GTGGCATTGAGACAGACAGTGGTGTTGATGATG-3′) and primer 2 (5′-CATCATCAACACCACTGTCTGTCTCAATGCCAC-3′). The resulting plasmid is called pHC33260. In this plasmid, the NheI site that was incorporated previously for screening plasmid pHC33209 was removed, and its absence was used for screening. All plasmids were sequenced (both DNA strands) to confirm the mutations. A schematic diagram of the proteins produced from these plasmids and used in the studies presented here is shown in Fig. 1. Protein Purification—Caspase-3, uncleavable procaspase-3(D9A,D28A,D175A) (called procaspase-3(D3A)) (16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), pro-less procaspase-3(D175A), and procaspase-3(D9A,D28A) were purified following overexpression in Escherichia coli as described previously (16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using ϵ280 = 26,500 m–1 cm–1 (21Pop C. Chen Y.-R. Smith B. Bose K. Bobay B. Tripathy A. Franzen S. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14224-14235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Activity Versus Salt Concentration—Protein was incubated at 25 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mm DTT for >1 h, and substrate (Ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin) was then added. Hydrolysis of the substrate was monitored as described previously (16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Pop C. Chen Y.-R. Smith B. Bose K. Bobay B. Tripathy A. Franzen S. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14224-14235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Salts were added to the buffer such that the final concentrations are those shown in the figures. Assays were performed in duplicate in the same buffer, and relative activity was determined versus salt concentration by comparing the initial velocity in the absence or presence of the salt. The concentration of substrate was 50 μm, and 10 nm caspase-3 or 50 nm procaspase-3 was used for each assay. Because DTT chelates Zn2+, the DTT was replaced with 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol in the assay buffer as described previously (13Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). We showed previously that one can measure ∼50-fold less enzymatic activity than the maximal activity observed for procaspase-3(D3A) (or 10,000-fold less than that of mature caspase-3), establishing the sensitivity of the assay (16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Changes in Fluorescence Emission as a Function of pH and Salt—To determine the structural effects of different cations on caspase-3 and procaspase-3, the proteins (2 μm) were incubated in 50 mm citrate (pH 3.0–6.2) or 50 mm phosphate (pH 6.0–9.0) containing NaCl, KCl, NH4Cl, MgCl2, or CaCl2 at 50–1000 mm. Samples were excited at 280 nm, and fluorescence emission was acquired between 305 and 400 nm (PTI C-61 spectrofluorometer, Photon Technology International). The average emission wavelength was then calculated at each pH as described previously (16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Feeney B. Pop C. Tripathy A. Clark A.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Royer C.A. Mann C.J. Matthews C.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1844-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and compared with the spectra of the wild-type protein. Salt Titrations at Low pH—As described in Fig. 3, salts affected the average emission wavelength for caspase-3 but not for procaspase-3 at low pH. Because of this, we examined whether the effect was cooperative, reversible, or dependent on the protein concentration. To examine cooperativity, caspase-3 was incubated in 20 mm citrate (pH 3.0) and in the absence or presence of 2 m NaCl, KCl, NH4Cl, MgCl2, or CaCl2. Using an Olis titrator coupled to the PTI C-61 spectrofluorometer, a solution of caspase-3 in buffer containing 2 m salt was titrated into a solution of caspase-3 without salts. The solutions were mixed and incubated for 20 min between each measurement to allow equilibration. The salt-dependent conformational changes at pH 3.0 were determined by calculating the change in the fluorescence average emission wavelength (22Royer C.A. Mann C.J. Matthews C.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1844-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) at each concentration of salt. Reversibility was examined using 2 μm protein and a two-phase reverse titration. The first phase consisted of salt concentrations between 1000 and 250 mm, and the second phase consisted of salt concentrations between 250 and 50 mm. Two additional points were taken manually to obtain 25 and 12.5 mm salt concentrations. We observed that the data from forward or reverse titrations were superimposable, demonstrating that the transitions are reversible. The protein concentration dependence was examined by performing the titrations at several protein concentrations (2–12 μm). Reversibility of Activity as a Function of Salt and pH—To examine the reversibility of enzymatic activity following incubation at low pH as well as at high salt concentrations, both caspase-3 and procaspase-3(D3A) were dialyzed for 4 h at 25 °C in 50 mm citrate (pH 3.0) plus 1 m salt or in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) plus 1 m salt for monovalent cations or 0.5 m salt for divalent cations. All buffers contained 1 mm DTT. The proteins were then dialyzed for 9 h at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm DTT. In all cases, the volume of the dialysis buffer was >500-fold that of the protein sample. The enzymatic activity was measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% CHAPS, 1% sucrose, and 10 mm DTT (assay buffer) (16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Pop C. Chen Y.-R. Smith B. Bose K. Bobay B. Tripathy A. Franzen S. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14224-14235Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using the substrate and protein concentrations described above. The initial velocity was compared with that of a control protein that had been stored at –20 °C (i.e. not dialyzed for 13 h). Activity as a Function of pH and Protein Concentration—The pH at which caspase-3 loses activity irreversibly was determined by dialyzing the protein (10 μm) for 4 h at 25 °C in 50 mm citrate (pH 3.0–6.0) or in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5–7.5) containing 1 mm DTT every 0.5 pH units. Samples were then dialyzed for 9 h at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm DTT. The enzymatic activity was measured in assay buffer and compared with that of a control sample of caspase-3 that had been incubated for 13 h at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm DTT. In all cases, the volume of the dialysis buffer was >500-fold that of the protein sample. To investigate the effect of protein concentration on solubility and return of activity in the pH-dependent folding of caspase-3, protein concentrations ranging from 2 to ∼50 μm were used. Samples of caspase-3 were incubated at 25 °C in 50 mm citrate (pH 4) and 1 mm DTT for 24 h to dissociate the heterotetramer (18Feeney B. Pop C. Tripathy A. Clark A.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Bose K. Clark A.C. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the protein was then refolded by dialyzing the samples against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm DTT at 25 °C for 24 h. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 25 °C for 5 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The absorbance at 280 nm was compared with that at time 0. The enzymatic activity was measured in assay buffer. The final protein concentrations in the enzymatic assays were as follows: caspase-3, 10 nm; pro-less procaspase-3(D175A), 50 nm; procaspase-3(D9A,D28A), 10 nm; and procaspase-3(D3A), 50 nm. To measure the loss of enzymatic activity over time, protein (1 μm) was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 25 °C for the times indicated in Fig. 7. In separate experiments, DTT (1 or 10 mm), KCl (1 m), MgCl2 (0.5 m), or caspase-3 propeptide (15 μm) was added to the buffer. Aliquots were removed at various times, and the enzymatic activity was measured in assay buffer. The final protein concentrations were 10 nm in the assays. To examine the effect of the prodomain concentration on the return of activity, the caspase-3, -6, or -7 prodomain was added to caspase-3 or pro-less procaspase-3(D175A) at 2–200-fold excess concentrations. The (pro)caspase concentrations were 10 μm. In these experiments, the proteins were dialyzed initially in 50 mm citrate (pH 4.0) for ∼24 h at 25 °C. Following the initial dialysis, the samples were then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for ∼24 h at 25 °C, and the enzymatic activity was measured as described above. All buffers contained 1 mm DTT. In these experiments, a dialysis membrane with an Mr 1000 cutoff was used. The final protein concentrations in the enzymatic assays were as follows: caspase-3, 10 nm; and pro-less procaspase-3(D175A), 50 nm. Activity Versus Salt Concentration—We examined the activities of caspase-3 and procaspase-3(D3A) in the presence of the monovalent cations Na+, K+, and NH+4 at concentrations up to 500 mm, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. As was observed previously (13Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), the activity of caspase-3 increased slightly (∼20%) in the presence of low concentrations of Na+ (∼25 mm) (Fig. 2A). This was true also for NH+4 (∼50 mm). However, K+ had little to no effect on the activity of caspase-3. In contrast, there was no effect of Na+ or NH+4 on the activity of procaspase-3(D3A) (Fig. 2B). Unlike the activity of caspase-3, that of procaspase-3 was sensitive to the presence of K+ and decreased to ∼50% in the presence of >25 mm K+. In the presence of Mg2+, the activities of caspase-3 and procaspase-3 decreased to ∼40%, and the midpoints of the transitions were similar, ∼100 mm (Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, the activities of both proteins decreased in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2, C and D). For caspase-3, the activity decreased to ∼50% between 10 and 100 mm Ca2+ and then decreased further at higher Ca2+ concentrations. For procaspase-3, the activity decreased to ∼25% in an apparent single transition, with a midpoint of ∼10 mm Ca2+. This is in contrast to results reported by Stennicke and Salvesen (13Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), who observed no effect on the activity of caspase-3 at concentrations up to 100 mm. It is not clear why there is a discrepancy in the results, although the experimental conditions are similar but not identical. For these studies, our assays were carried out at 25 °C rather than at 37 °C, and our buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) rather than 20 mm PIPES (pH 7.2) and did not contain sucrose. In addition, the control with which the activities were compared was taken from a fresh stock of protein that had been stored at –20 °C until just prior to use. At present, it is not clear which of these parameters would result in the discrepancy. Regardless, it is interesting to note that [Ca2+]i is ∼100 nm and either increases slightly or does not change significantly, depending on the cell type, during apoptosis (9Yu S.P. Canzoniero L.M.T. Choi D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Thus, in the effects described here, the Ca2+ concentrations are at least 4 orders of magnitude higher than those found in apoptotic cells. Our conclusion from these studies is that, although Ca2+ does affect the activities of both caspase-3 and procaspase-3 in vitro and at high concentrations, it is unlikely that Ca2+ fluctuations in apoptotic cells directly affect the activity of either protein. However, this is not true of K+ because the concentrations used in our experiments are comparable with those found in vivo. Therefore, although the activity of caspase-3 is unaffected by changes in the levels of K+, the activity of the procaspase would be expected to increase if the efflux of potassium during apoptosis resulted in concentrations below 25 mm. Caspase-3 is known to be inactivated by micromolar concentrations of Zn2+, and it has been suggested that Zn2+ coordinates one or both catalytic residues His121 and Cys163 (14Perry D.K. Smyth M.J.

As shown in Fig. 2E, caspase-3 was completely inactivated by ∼10 mm Zn2+, in agreement with previous studies (13Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 14Perry D.K. Smyth M.J. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Duriez P. Poirier G.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18530-18533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, procaspase-3(D3A) is much less sensitive to Zn2+. We observed that the procaspase was inactivated by Zn2+ concentrations between 300 and 400 μm, >3 orders of magnitude that required to inactivate caspase-3 (compare the midpoints of the curves in Fig. 2E). This is in agreement with our assertion that the catalytic residue Cys163 is less solvent-accessible in the procaspase than in the mature caspase (16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has been shown that ionic effects on caspase activity are due to cations rather than anions (6Segal M.S. Beem E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1196-C1204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed this by examining chloride, acetate, sulfate, and phosphate anions using the sodium or magnesium salts of each. We observed no effect on the enzymatic activity of either caspase-3 or procaspase-3(D3A) beyond those described above for the cations (data not shown). Structural Changes as a Function of pH and Salt—The active site of procaspase-3(D3A) was shown to be distinctly different from that of mature caspase-3, as evidenced in part by the differences in pH-dependent activity profiles (16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Procaspase-3(D3A) exhibits maximal activity between pH 8.0 and 8.5, in contrast to caspase-3, which has a maximal activity between pH 7.2 and 7.8 (13Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 16Bose K. Pop C. Feeney B. Clark A.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12298-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, we examined changes in the fluorescence average emission wavelength (〈λ 〉) (Fig. 3), which report on conformational changes in the protein that result from changes in pH (16Bose K.

At the molecular level Pak2 binds Cdc42(GTP), translocating Pak2 to the endoplasmic reticulum where it is autophosphorylated and activated. Pak2 is autophosphorylated at eight sites; Ser-141 and Ser-165 in the regulatory domain and Thr-402 in the activation loop are identified as key sites in activation of the protein kinase. The function of phosphorylation of Ser-141 and Ser-165 on the activation was analyzed with wild-type (WT) and mutants of Pak2. With S141A, the level of autophosphorylation was reduced to 65% as compared with that of WT and S141D with a concomitant 45% reduction in substrate phosphorylation, indicating that phosphorylation at Ser-141 is required for optimal activity. Autophosphorylation inhibited the interaction between WT Pak2 and Cdc42(GTP). In 293T cells, WT Pak2, S141A, and S141D formed a stable complex with the constitutively active mutant Cdc42 L61, but not with the dominant negative Cdc42 N17. As shown in glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, S141A bound to Cdc42(GTP) at a 6-fold higher level than that of S141D. In contrast, the S165A and S165D mutants had no effect on autophosphorylation, binding to Cdc42, or activation of Pak2. In summary, autophosphorylation of Ser-141 was required for activation of Pak2 and down-regulated the interaction of Pak2 with Cdc42. A model is proposed suggesting that binding of Cdc42 localizes Pak2 to the endoplasmic reticulum, where autophosphorylation alters association of the two proteins.

The role of autophosphorylation in the activation of Pak has been analyzed with Pak1 and Pak2. Manser et al. (6Manser E. Huang H.-Y. Loo T.-H. Chen X.-Q. Dong J.-M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mapped the sites of autophosphorylation in Cdc42(GTPγS)-activated Pak1 in vitro; six serine residues in the regulatory domain and a single threonine residue in the catalytic domain were identified. Gatti et al. (7Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) identified eight autophosphorylation sites in Pak2 that are activated by Cdc42 in vitro (serines 19, 20, 55, 141, 165, 192, and 197 and threonine 402). Except for serines 19 and 165, six of the sites are equivalent to those in Pak1. Autophosphorylation of Pak2 in the absence and presence of Cdc42 showed that autophosphorylation of Ser-141, Ser-165, and Thr-402 is specific for active Pak2 (7Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T.

The conserved threonine in the activation loop of the catalytic domain, Thr-402 in Pak2 and Thr-423 in Pak1, was shown to be required for full activation of Pak (8Jakobi R. Huang Z. Walter B.N.

Among members of Pak family, Pak2 is the only isoform that is cleaved and activated by caspase 3 (10Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

Pak1 is localized to the lamellipodia and filopodia and regulates cytoskeletal structure when stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (19Dharmawardhane S. Brownson D. Lennartz M. Bokoch G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, Pak2 is translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by Cdc42 and becomes activated, resulting in the induction of cytostasis (17Roig J. Huang Z. Lytle C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16933-16940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Huang Z. Ling J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13101-13109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, activation and localization of Pak proteins are tightly regulated. Zhao et al. (21Zhao Z.-S. Manser E. Chen X.-Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Cdc42-mediated activation of Pak1 was inhibited 7-fold by a polypeptide containing the AID (amino acids 83-149). The inhibitory effect of AID was also observed in HeLa cells with a constitutively active mutant of Pak1 (21Zhao Z.-S. Manser E. Chen X.-Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When two autophosphorylated serines in the regulatory domain of Pak1, Ser-144 and Ser-149, were mutated to alanine, the activity of the S144A/S149A mutant was greatly reduced (22Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17347-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylated Pak1 or AID phosphorylated at Ser-144 and Ser-149 completely abolishes the inhibitory effect of the AID on Pak1 activation (21Zhao Z.-S. Manser E. Chen X.-Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17347-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of autophosphorylation of Ser-141 and Ser-165 in the Cdc42-dependent activation of Pak2. With S141A activated by Cdc42(GTPγS), autophosphorylation and activity measured by phosphorylation of the peptide substrate S3 were significantly reduced as compared with those of WT. The other serine mutants (S141D, S165A, and S165D) showed a similar activity to that of WT Pak2. A stable association between Pak2 and Cdc42(GTP) in vitro and in 293T cells was detected with WT Pak2 and S141A or S141D by the GST pull-down assay and coimmunoprecipitation. Binding of active Cdc42 with S141A was 5-fold higher than with S141D. In contrast, with the other mutants (T402A, T402E, K278R, S165A, S165D), no stable interaction with Cdc42 was detected. Thus, phosphorylation of Ser-141 had a negative effect on the association between Pak2 and Cdc42. These results suggest that Ser-141 is a potential site for manipulation of the cytostatic properties of Pak2 by regulating the localization of Pak2 to the ER.

The DNA constructs for WT Pak2 and the mutants T402A, T402E, and K278R were described previously (8Jakobi R. Huang Z. Walter B.N. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4414-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—To prepare the Pak2 mutants S141A, S141D, S165A, and S165D, site-directed mutagenesis was performed by a PCR-based megaprimer method using the Pfu polymerase (8Jakobi R. Huang Z. Walter B.N. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4414-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Sarkar G. Somer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). To mutate Ser-141 to alanine the 3′ primer 5′-CTCCGGAGGAGTGAAGGCCAGGTACTTCTGCTTCAC-3′ was used, and for aspartate the 3′ primer 5′-CTCCGGAGGAGTGAAGTCCAGGTACTTCTGCTTCAC-3′ was used.

Ser-165 was changed to alanine with the mutagenic primer 5′-CTTCTGTTACTACTGCTGCTGTTTCTGATACCTTGG-3′ and changed to aspartate with the primer 5′-CTTCTGT-TACTACTGCGTCTGTTTCTGA-TACCTTGG-3′. From the first PCR reaction, the double-stranded megaprimer containing mutation sites was amplified with one of mutagenic primers listed above along with the 5′ flanking primer (5′-ATGTCTGATAACGGAGAACTG-3′) for Pak2. The second PCR was performed with the 5′ megaprimer and the 3′ flanking primer (5′-TTAGCGGTTACTCTTCATTGC-3′) for Pak2. The amplified mutant DNAs were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel and purified by a Geneclean II kit. The eluted DNA was double-digested with NdeI and NcoI and subcloned into the NdeI/NcoI sites of pBlue-NK, which was described elsewhere (8Jakobi R. Huang Z. Walter B.N. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4414-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). During subcloning, all bacterial cultures were incubated at 28 °C to reduce random mutations. Previously, the expression clones for wild-type or an active form of Pak2 were shown to have a cytotoxic or cytostatic effect on bacteria (8Jakobi R. Huang Z. Walter B.N. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4414-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that often caused random mutations. The cDNAs for WT Pak2 and the mutants were subcloned into the baculovirus vector pAcG2T to express mutant proteins in insect cells as described by Jakobi et al. (8Jakobi R. Huang Z. Walter B.N. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4414-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+ for HA-Pak2 as described by Huang et al. (20Huang Z. Ling J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13101-13109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The entire sequences of mutant cDNAs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Pak2—TN5B-4 insect cells were maintained in EX-CELL 401 with 50 μg/ml gentamicin and incubated at 27 °C. The pAcG2T plasmids for S141A, S141D, S165A, and S165D were individually transfected into insect cells and, after 2 days, the cells were collected and lysed as described previously (8Jakobi R. Huang Z. Walter B.N. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4414-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). GST-Pak2 was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and released from the beads with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) or the GST was removed by cleavage with thrombin as described elsewhere (10Walter B.N.

Autophosphorylation of Pak—Recombinant GST-Pak2 (0.3 μg) was autophosphorylated in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity was 1,000 cpm/pmol) for 20 min at 30 °C in the absence and presence of Cdc42 (6 μg), preloaded with GTPγS (0.18 mm) for 10 min at 30 °C as described elsewhere (5Jakobi R. Chen C.-J. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6206-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To terminate autophosphorylation, 10 μl of SDS sample buffer was added. Autophosphorylation of Pak2 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie blue and autoradiography. Protein Kinase Assays—To measure the protein kinase activity of Pak2, phosphorylation of the peptide substrate S3 (AKRESAA) was carried out in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing pre-autophosphorylated GST-Pak2 (0.22 μg) as described above, with the addition of 1 mm S3 and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin (24Tuazon P.T. Spanos W.C. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16059-16064Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and terminated on ice with 6 μl of 100 mm non-radiolabeled ATP. The peptide was precipitated on P81 phosphocellulose paper with 75 mm H3PO4. The paper was washed with 75 mm H3PO4 three times, washed with water twice, and dried. S3 phosphorylation was quantified by scintillation counting. Tryptic Phosphopeptide Mapping—To perform tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, autophosphorylated GST-Pak2 was excised from the polyacrylamide gel and extensively digested with trypsin as described by Tuazon et al. (25Tuazon P.T. Merrick W.C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2773-2777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were separated in the first dimension by electrophoresis and in the second dimension by thin layer chromatography. 32P-labeled peptides were detected using the PhosphorImager SI (Amersham Biosciences). Culture and Transfection of 293T Cells—Cells (5×105) were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with HA-Pak2 in the pcDNA 3.1+ vector alone (0.4 μg) or with HA-Cdc42 L61 or N17 in pcDNA 3.1+ (0.2 μg) using the FuGENE6 reagent as described by the manufacturer. The transfected DNA was normalized to 0.6 μg by addition of the empty vector. At 24 h post-transfection the cells were collected, washed twice with chilled phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen at -80 °C prior to further analyses. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—To prepare the cell lysate for immunoprecipitation of HA-Pak2, frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na3P2O5, 10 nm okadaic acid, and 1 mm Na3VO4), and protease inhibitors (4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Resuspended cells were kept on ice for 20 min, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Total protein was quantified using Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard protein. To analyze the interaction between Pak2 and Cdc42, 200 μg of lysate were incubated with 0.4 μg of Pak2 antibody N-19 for 1 h at 4°C. Additionally, 20 μl of protein A/G agarose beads (1:1 slurry solution) were added, and the sample was incubated for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 1 min and washed three times with lysis buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. HA-Pak2 and HA-Cdc42 were detected by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody as described (20Huang Z. Ling J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13101-13109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GST Pull-down Assay—To study the effect of autophosphorylation on the interaction of Pak2 with Cdc42, 0.2 μg of Pak2 was incubated with 1 μg of GST-Cdc42 pre-loaded with GTPγS in the absence and presence of ATP (0.2 mm) for 30 min at 30°C in a 40-μl reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Glutathione beads (20 μl) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Pak2 bound to Cdc42 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the Pak2 antibody N-19. GST-Cdc42 was detected by Coomassie staining of the membrane. GST-Cdc42(GTPγS) was incubated with 293T cell lysate (200 μg) containing WT or mutants of HA-Pak2 at 4 °C for 30 min and then incubated with 30 μl of glutathione beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were spun down and washed three times with lysis buffer. Bound Pak2 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-HA antibody and quantified using NIH ImageJ. Data Analysis—All of the observations were confirmed in at least three independent experiments. The statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t test. A p value of 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Analysis of Autophosphorylation of Wild-type and Mutants of Pak2—Autophosphorylation of Pak2 at serines 141 and 165 required Cdc42(GTP). Ser-141 is situated at the C terminus of the AID domain, whereas Ser-165 is located in a region of undefined function (Fig. 1A). Ser-141 is conserved in Pak1 (Ser-144) and Pak3 (Ser-139); Pak1 also contains a second autophosphorylation site at Ser-149. Ser-165 is present only in Pak2 from rabbit and rat; all other isoforms contain proline instead of serine (Fig. 1B). To examine the effects of autophosphorylation of Ser-141 and Ser-165 on Cdc42-mediated activation of Pak2, the two sites were mutated to either alanine or aspartate mimicking a non-phosphorylated or a phosphorylated residue, respectively. WT Pak2, the mutants S141A, S165A, S141D, S165D, and T402A were expressed and purified from insect cells as GST fusion proteins and autophosphorylated in the absence and presence of Cdc42(GTPγS). The extent of autophosphorylation of WT Pak2 with Cdc42 was maximal at 20 min. WT Pak2 and the mutants, autophosphorylated in the absence of Cdc42, migrated as a single band. Slower migrating bands were observed on SDS-PAGE when Pak2 was incubated with Cdc42(GTPγS) because of increased autophosphorylation (Fig. 2A, top section). With Cdc42, the two major bands of WT Pak2 were shifted upward on SDS-PAGE. Similar shifts were detected with serine 141 and serine 165 mutants. One shifted band was observed for T402A with Cdc42, which matched the faster migrating band of the two bands for WT with Cdc42. As shown by autoradiography (Fig. 2A, bottom section), there was a significant increase in the autophosphorylation of WT, S141A and S141D, and S165A and S165D upon the addition of Cdc42. Essentially no phosphorylation of T402A was observed in the absence of Cdc42, and T402A had a low level of autophosphorylation with Cdc42. To compare the extent of autophosphorylation between WT and mutant forms of GST-Pak2, the level of autophosphorylation was normalized to the amount of Pak2 protein, and autophosphorylation of WT Pak2 in the presence of Cdc42(GTPγS) was set at 1.00 (Fig. 2B). Autophosphorylation of WT GST-Pak2 was stimulated 7-fold by the addition of Cdc42. The Ser-141 and Ser-165 mutants showed a 4- to 7-fold stimulation of autophosphorylation by Cdc42. There was no significant difference between the basal levels of autophosphorylation with WT and the mutants of Ser-141 and Ser-165. However, the basal autophosphorylation of T402A was ∼3-fold lower than that of WT. Replacement of Thr-402 with alanine significantly decreased autophosphorylation of Pak2 with Cdc42, as compared with WT activated by Cdc42. Mutation of Ser-141 to alanine reduced the level of autophosphorylation to 0.62, as compared with activated WT Pak2. The three mutants S141D, S165A, and S165D showed a similar level of autophosphorylation as WT Pak2 with Cdc42. Thus, the full extent of autophosphorylation of Pak2 with Cdc42 required autophosphorylation of Thr-402 and Ser-141, but not Ser-165. To further evaluate the mutants of Pak2 in terms of autophosphorylation, WT Pak2 and the mutants phosphorylated in the presence of Cdc42(GTPγS) were analyzed by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. The two-dimensional map of WT Pak2 had 10 identified phosphopeptides as shown in the schematic (Fig. 3, upper left and middle sections). Previously, Gatti et al. (7Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) sequenced the tryptic phosphopeptides of Pak2 following two-dimensional peptide gel electrophoresis. The identified phosphopeptides were individually eluted from the peptide gel and analyzed in the two-dimensional system used in these experiments. 3P. T. Tuazon and J. A. Traugh, unpublished data. The phosphopeptides are summarized in Fig. 3, lower left section. To examine the result of autophosphorylation, the three mutants were compared with WT Pak2. Two phosphopeptides, 7 and 8, previously identified as Thr-402, were missing in the map of T402A (Fig. 3, upper right section). Spot 3 corresponded to Ser-141, and phosphopeptide 3 was missing in the map of S141A (Fig. 3, lower middle panel). In the map of S165A, all of the spots were detected (Fig. 3, lower right panel). This was due to the fact that spots 6 and 9 also contained peptides with autophosphorylated Ser-197 (7Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although the extent of autophosphorylation of S141A and T402A was reduced as compared with the WT level, all of the phosphopeptides except those containing the mutation site were detected in the two-dimensional maps. Thus phosphorylation of Ser-141 and Thr-402 could alter the conformation of Pak2 rather than directly regulate autophosphorylation at other sites. The Protein Kinase Activity of WT Pak2 and Pak2 Mutants—To determine the effects of the mutations of the autophosphorylation site mutants, WT and mutant forms of Pak2 were assayed with the peptide substrate S3. Pak2 was pre-autophosphorylated in the absence and presence of Cdc42(GTPγS), and the substrate was added and phosphorylated under kinetically valid conditions where <5% of S3 was phosphorylated. The rate of phosphorylation of S3 with WT Pak2 was increased 6-fold with Cdc42(GTPγS); the level of phosphorylation of S3 by Cdc42-activated Pak2 was set as 1.00 (Fig. 4). The rate of phosphorylation with S141A was stimulated 5-fold by Cdc42(GTPγS), but the level was reduced to 0.56 as compared with that of WT, although S141D was similar to WT (0.95). Phosphorylation of S3 with S165A was increased 10-fold by Cdc42 to 1.21, whereas the activity of S165D was 0.88. There was little or no substrate phosphorylation by T402A with and without Cdc42. Taken together, the data indicated that autophosphorylation of Ser-141 was required for full protein kinase activity. In contrast, the substitution of Ser-165 to alanine or aspartate had essentially no inhibitory effect on Pak2 activity. Similar effects were observed with histone 4 and myelin basic protein (data not shown). Interaction of Pak2 with Cdc42—Because Pak2 was activated by association with Cdc42 and autophosphorylation, we examined whether autophosphorylation of Pak2 altered the interaction between Pak2 and Cdc42. Purified Pak2 was incubated with GST-Cdc42(GTPγS) in the absence and presence of ATP, and GST pull-down assays were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Pak2 antibody to detect Pak2 bound to Cdc42. As shown in the input, autophosphorylated Pak2 had two bands whereas non-phosphorylated Pak2 had only the lower band (Fig. 5). There was significant binding of non-phosphorylated Pak2 to Cdc42(GTPγS). In four independent experiments the association of autophosphorylated Pak2 and Cdc42 was decreased to 0.24 ± 0.03 (p < 0.01) as compared with non-phosphorylated Pak2. Thus, autophosphorylation of Pak2 negatively regulated the interaction between Pak2 and Cdc42. The association of Pak2 with Cdc42 was examined further using the mutant forms of Pak2. Pak2 was expressed in 293T cells and subjected to pull-down analyses with GST-Cdc42. As compared with the WT, the expression of S141A was 60% lower than that of WT, whereas the expression S165A was slightly higher than that of WT (Fig. 6A, upper section). In contrast, other mutants such as kinase-negative K278R and T402A, kinase-active T402E, and the phosphomimics S141D and S165D were expressed at a 3- to 5-fold higher level than WT, as shown by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. This result is consistent with previous data showing that the expression of Pak2 is tightly regulated by ubiquitination and degradation through the proteosome pathway because of the cytostatic nature of the protein kinase (20Huang Z. Ling J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13101-13109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Roig J. Tuazon P.T. Zipfel P.A. Pendergast A.M. Traugh J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14346-14351Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutants that lack the ability to induce cytostasis are expressed at significantly higher levels. The reduced expression of S141A suggests that it has similar cytostatic properties. Cell lysates containing expressed HA-WT or mutants of Pak2 were incubated with GST-Cdc42(GTPγS), and the Pak2 associated with GST-Cdc42 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. WT Pak2 and the mutants S141D and S141A bound to GST-Cdc42 (Fig. 6A, lower sections). The other mutants, K278R, T402A, T402E, S165A, and S165D, were not detected by Western blotting and thus did not bind to Cdc42(GTPγS). When the level of Pak2 bound to Cdc42 was normalized to the amount of expressed protein, the association of S141A with Cdc42 was similar to that of WT and 6-fold higher than that of S141D (Fig. 6B). The amount of Cdc42 was not a limiting factor in the assay, as the amount of GST-Cdc42 used in these experiments was 5-fold higher than that of HA-Pak2 in the cell lysate. Thus the phosphomimic S141D bound Cdc42(GTP) to a lesser extent than S141A or WT. The interaction between Pak2 and Cdc42 was also analyzed in vivo. 293T cells were cotransfected with HA-Pak2 WT and mutants and constitutively active Cdc42 L61 or dominant negative Cdc42 N17. HA-Pak2 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Pak2 antibody N-19, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-HA antibody to detect both Pak2 and Cdc42. Active Cdc42 L61 coimmunoprecipitated with WT Pak2, S141D, and S141A but not with the other mutants, consistent with the results of the GST pull-down assays (Fig. 7, upper left sections). Dominant negative Cdc42 N17 did not bind to any of Pak2 proteins assayed (Fig. 7, upper right sections). The expression levels of the Pak2 proteins were similar to the data shown in Fig. 6. K278R, T402A, T402E, S141D, and S165D were expressed at a 3- to 5-fold higher level than WT Pak2. WT Pak2, S141A, and S165A were significantly reduced. Cdc42 L61 and N17 were coexpressed at a similar level throughout (Fig. 7, lower sections). When the data were quantified and the ratio of Cdc42 bound to Pak2 WT set as 1.0, the ratio for S141D was 1.1 whereas that of S141A was 3.6. Thus, the interaction of Cdc42 L61 with S141A was 3-fold higher than that with S141D, which was consistent with the result of GST pull-down assay. The data suggest that the phosphorylation status at Ser-141 can alter the interaction of Pak2 and Cdc42. Pak2 is activated through dissociation of the AID from the catalytic site by the binding of Cdc42(GTP) or following caspase 3 cleavage and subsequent autophosphorylation at multiple sites. Autophosphorylation of Ser-141, Ser-165, and Thr-402 is correlated with Cdc42-dependent activation of Pak2 (7Gatti A. Huang Z. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8022-8028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr-402 is essential for the full level of autophosphorylation and activation of Pak2 following binding of active Cdc42 or cleavage with caspase 3 (8Jakobi R. Huang Z. Walter B.N. Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4414-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 10Walter B.N. Huang Z. Jakobi R. Tuazon P.T. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Traugh J.A. J. Biol.

In this study we showed that autophosphorylation of Ser-141 in the regulatory domain is necessary for activation of Pak2 by Cdc42 and also has a second function, modulating the interaction with Cdc42. As summarized in TABLE ONE, the alanine mutant of Ser-141 has less activity than WT and the S141D mutant, but the association of S141A with Cdc42(GTP) is significantly enhanced as compared with WT and S141D.TABLE ONESummary of the activity and the levels of expression and association with Cdc42 of WT Pak2 and the mutantsPak2ActivityaThe relative activity of Pak2 was measured by S3 phosphorylation in vitroExpression in 293T cellsbThe relative expression of Pak2 was determined by Western blotting following transfection of HA-Pak2 in 293T cellsStable association with active Cdc42cInteraction with active Cdc42 was determined by pull-down assay with GST-Cdc42(GTPγS) and 293T cell lysates containing HA-PAK2WT212S141A113S141D231S165A220S165D230T402A020T402E2dData not shown30K278R0dData not shown30a The relative activity of Pak2 was measured by S3 phosphorylation in vitrob The relative expression of Pak2 was determined by Western blotting following transfection of HA-Pak2 in 293T cellsc Interaction with active Cdc42 was determined by pull-down assay with GST-Cdc42(GTPγS) and 293T cell lysates containing HA-PAK2d Data not shown Open table in a new tab Autophosphorylation of Ser-141, as well as Thr-402, is required to obtain full autophosphorylation and a maximal rate of substrate phosphorylation by Cdc42-activated Pak2. Ser-141 is conserved in all three Pak enzymes; replacement of Ser-144 in Pak1 and Ser-139 in Pak3 with alanine was shown to significantly reduce the protein kinase activity of these enzymes (22Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17347-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the position of Ser-141, which is located in the C terminal region of AID. This region, including serine 144, is positioned to make contacts with the active cleft of the catalytic domain in the crystal structure of Pak1 (27Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.-C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In this structure, lysine 141 forms salt bridges with Asp-389 in the catalytic loop and Asp-407 in the magnesium positioning loop, suggesting that autophosphorylation of Ser-144 could change the charge distribution in the contact region and interfere with the ionic interaction between Lys141 and aspartate residues 389 and 407. Thus, we suggest that autophosphorylation of Ser-141 in Pak2 could play a role in maintaining the protein kinase in an active conformation by inhibiting the autoinhibitory interaction. Autophosphorylation of Pak2, induced by binding of Cdc42(GTP), also negatively regulates the interaction between Pak2 and Cdc42 as well as activating the protein kinase. The interaction of brain-specific Pak3 with Cdc42 and Rac1 was significantly decreased by p21-induced autophosphorylation (3Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). It was suggested that autophosphorylation of Pak could release the GTPases from Pak as Pak became activated. Our studies take this further. WT Pak2, S141D, and S141A binds to Cdc42(GTPγS) and constitutively active Cdc42 L61, as shown by GST pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation. This association is stable as compared with that of other kinase mutants that are activated by Cdc42 such as S165A, S165D, and T402A. Although the autophosphorylation and activity of these enzymes are stimulated by Cdc42, they do not form a stable complex with Cdc42. Following autophosphorylation, the continued association of Pak with Cdc42 is not required for Pak activity (2Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Binding of S141A to Cdc42 is 6-fold higher than the association of S141D with Cdc42. The stable association with Cdc42 could be involved in maintaining the subcellular localization of Pak2 in the ER, which is modulated by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Ser-141. Subcellular localization as well as protein kinase activity is critical for the physiological functioning of Pak. Cdc42/Rac1-activated Pak1 has been shown to localize to focal adhesions, modulate cytoskeleton reorganizations, and stimulate cell migration (14Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 28Sells M.A. Pfaff A. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast Cdc42-activated Pak2 is localized to the ER. In exponentially growing 3T3-L1 cells, Pak2 is primarily inactive and only a small amount of total Pak2 (∼5%) is associated with the ER (17Roig J. Huang Z. Lytle C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16933-16940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Huang Z. Ling J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13101-13109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In response to stress such as hyperosmolarity, Cdc42 translocates Pak2 to the ER, which results in autophosphorylation and activation (17Roig J. Huang Z. Lytle C. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16933-16940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The association of Pak with the ER inhibits cell division, indicating a cytostatic state (20Huang Z. Ling J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13101-13109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The Pak2 mutant S490D and the C-terminal deletion mutant Δ488 do not localize to the ER and do not inhibit cell division even though these mutants have high levels of protein kinase activity, whereas S490A has cytostatic properties similar to those of WT Pak2 (20Huang Z. Ling J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13101-13109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As shown in the model in Fig. 8, under cell growth conditions Pak2 is primarily inactive through the interaction of AID with the active site of the catalytic domain. Pak2 can be partially autophosphorylated without being activated. This basal level of autophosphorylation is at five serine sites (Ser-19, Ser-20, Ser-55, Ser-192, and Ser-197) in the regulatory domain (soluble inactive Pak2). When Cdc42(GTP) binds Pak2, disrupting the autoinhibitory conformation of Pak2, the Cdc42-associated Pak2 is translocated to the ER and activated by autophosphorylation at Ser-165 and Thr-402 (ER-associated, partially active Pak2). With additional phosphorylation at Ser-141, Pak2 is fully activated, leading to phosphorylation of downstream target protein(s) and cell growth arrest. At the same time, phosphorylation of Ser-141 lowers the affinity of the interaction between Pak2 and Cdc42. This could alter the association of Pak2, which could promote Cdc42 to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, resulting in dissociation of Cdc42(GDP) from Pak2 (ER-associated fully active Pak2).

As the “guardian of the genome,” p53 acts as a link between upstream signaling cascades and downstream response pathways. Genotoxic stress results in p53 activation, and the protein primarily functions as a sequence-specific transcriptional activator of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (1Vogelstein B.

However, there are several lines of evidence that show that p53 also participates in other cellular processes in a transcription-independent manner.

Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 639-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). p53 can also modulate BLM and WRN helicase activity on Holliday junction templates (27Yang Q. Zhang R. Wang X.W. Spillare E.A. Linke S.P. Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. Li J.L. Hickson I.D. Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Mazur S.J. Appella E. Brosh Jr., R.M. Karmakar P. Bohr V.A. Harris C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31980-31987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Strand exchange between two duplexes is a key step in homologous recombination creating a four-stranded Holliday junction intermediate. Branch migration of the Holliday junction results in further exchange between the two strands; this process can be spontaneous or protein-induced. As a result, heteroduplexes can be created if the exchanged strands are not completely complementary. p53 has been shown to bind both heteroduplexes and Holliday junctions as well as increase junction resolution by resolvases (11Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7532-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, p53 regulation of homologous recombination could involve interactions with recombination-specific proteins or direct association with the DNA intermediates. By recognizing and binding to these structures, the protein can ensure that exchange between imperfectly matched sequences does not occur.p53 also plays an important role in monitoring the various steps of DNA replication to ensure faithful transmission of genetic material. p53 blocks replication initiation if DNA damage is present upstream of the origin. Using templates containing the polyoma virus origin (which contains an internal p53 binding site) and upstream damage sites, Zhou and Prives (28Zhou J. Prives C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3881-3892Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) showed that replication was inhibited and proposed a model of DNA looping between the two p53 sites, thus sterically hindering replication initiation or elongation. Once replication has been initiated, fork arrest can result from a variety of factors such as the presence of DNA lesions on the parental strand or bound proteins that act as a barrier to fork progression. Recombinational repair can be used to restart these stalled forks in which double strand breaks are created followed by strand invasion by the broken strand and duplication from the intact chromatid. However, this process may generate small insertions or deletions in the daughter strand. A second mechanism of fork reactivation is replication fork reversal in which reverse migration causes the newly synthesized strands to anneal to each other and extrude a fourth strand, thus creating a “chickenfoot” intermediate that resembles Holliday junctions. Once the lesion on the parental strand is repaired, reverse branch migration can restore the fork to the initial position by a non-recombinogenic method. Alternately, endonucleolytic cleavage of the chickenfoot structure and recombinational repair can also restart the fork. Yoon et al. (26Yoon D. Wang Y. Stapleford K. Wiesmuller L. Chen J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 639-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have shown that hRAD51 can promote regression of stalled replication forks and that this activity is inhibited by p53. However, the exact mechanism of p53-dependent hRad51 inhibition was not clear. These authors (26Yoon D. Wang Y. Stapleford K. Wiesmuller L. Chen J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 639-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) proposed either interference with hRad51 promoted nucleofilament formation or branch migration could be responsible for p53 inhibition. p53 also modulates BLM helicase activity on stalled replication forks, but the mechanism involved is unknown.To understand the exact role of p53 in processing stalled replication forks, we generated large templates that resemble these structures and used electron microscopy (EM) 2The abbreviations used are: EMelectron microscopydsdouble strand.2The abbreviations used are: EMelectron microscopydsdouble strand. to examine the interactions of p53 with these substrates. The results show that p53 bound with high affinity at the junction of stalled replication forks. Additionally, some of the bound templates were found to be rearranged to form four-stranded or chickenfoot structures. These appear to be formed as a result of p53 trapping intermediates of spontaneous fork regression. In some cases p53 can also induce fork regression reactions. Additionally, two cancer-related p53 mutants bound very poorly to these templates. These observations suggest that p53 functions in the processing of stalled replication forks as well as branch migration of Holliday junctions containing heteroduplexes by binding to functional intermediates, thus preventing further strand movement until any DNA damage present is repaired.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—The 400-bp G-less cassette (29Sawadogo M.

Complementary oligomers 1) 5′-AATTCGCTAAGGACCGACGCTTAAGTAGGTTAAGGGTTAAGCTGAGG-3′ and 2) 5′-CCTCAGCTTAACCCTTAACCTACTTAAGCGTCGGTCCTTAGCGC-3′ were annealed to create a 35-bp duplex that has a 5′-overhang complementary to EcoRI and a 3′-blunt end. The duplex contains a site for the nicking endonuclease, N.BbvCIA, indicated in bold on oligonucleotide 1. The 35-bp duplex was cloned into the EcoRI/SmaI site of pBSGless to create pGLGAP.Preparation of Replication Fork Templates—Plasmids (10 μg) were digested with N.BbvCIA (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA) using the manufacturer's conditions to introduce a single nick at the start of the G-less cassette. Single strand tails were created by strand displacement using 5 units of the Klenow fragment (exo–) (New England Biolabs) in 20-μl reactions containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 5 mm each dATP, dTTP, and dGTP at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were purified using DNA Clean and Concentrator spin columns (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) following the manufacturer's conditions. To create a double strand tail, primer 25 (5′-CTTCCTCCATCTATACCACC-3′) was annealed to the 3′-end of the displaced single strand at a 10-fold molar excess at 37 °C for 30 min in 40-μl reactions containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 5 mm each dATP, dTTP, and dCTP followed by the addition of 5 units of Klenow fragment (exo–) and further incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The templates were purified using DNA Clean and Concentrator spin columns and quantified. This results in a duplex circle with a double strand tail that has a 25-nucleotide gap at the junction of the circle and tail. In some cases the plasmids were linearized with XmnI (New England Biolabs), placing the double strand tails asymmetrically.DNA Probes—Holliday junction probes were synthesized as described previously (30Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2427-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, one strand of the probe was first end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) followed by the addition of the other three strands to create a four-way junction. The samples were heated to 65 °C for 10 min in the presence of 0.4 m NaCl and allowed to slowly cool to room temperature overnight. Annealed products were purified on 10% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels.Proteins—Wild type p53 as well as mutants, R175H and R273H (obtained from Dr. Arnold Levine), were purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described previously (31Wu L. Bayle J.H. Elenbaas B. Pavletich N.P. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Electron Microscopy—Reactions (20 μl) containing 45 fmol of DNA, 180 fmol of p53 (tetramers), 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and fixed with gluteraldehyde (0.6% final concentration) for an additional 10 min. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free proteins on a 1-ml gel filtration column (4% agarose, Agarose Bead Technologies, Tampa, FL) and mounted on carbon-coated copper grids followed by ethanol dehydration and rotary shadowcasting with tungsten as described previously (32Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Samples were examined on a Phillips CM12 electron microscope, and images were captured on a Gatan multiscan 794 digital camera (Pleasanton, CA) or on sheet film. Image contrast was adjusted, and the panels were arranged used Adobe Photoshop. Molecule lengths were measured using Gatan Digital Micrograph software. For linear templates, the length of the short segment and total DNA were measured for each molecule in nm and then converted to bp by the following equation.shortarm(bp)=(shortarm(nm)totallength(nm))×3400bp The total length of the templates was 1172.2 ± 49.8 nm (n = 550); therefore variations due to measurement errors are 144 bp.Mobility Shift Assays—End-labeled probes (0.18 pmol) were incubated with proteins (1.8 or 3.6 pmol) in 20-μl reactions containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 25 ng of salmon sperm DNA as nonspecific competitor for 20 min at room temperature. Reaction products were separated on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) and were run at 200 V for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography.RESULTSPreparation of Replication Fork Templates—To create templates that mimic replication forks, we generated plasmids that contain a 400-bp G-less cassette (see “Experimental Procedures”) as well as an N.BbvCIA recognition site at the 5′-end of this cassette (Fig. 1). Supercoiled plasmids were nicked at the N.BbvCIA site, and strand displacement reactions were carried out with the Klenow fragment (exo–) in the absence of dCTP so that polymerization stopped at the end of the cassette when the first guanine was encountered. Additionally, nonspecific strand displacement reactions were prevented by the exclusion of dCTP. Primers were annealed to the 3′-end of the single strand displaced tail leaving a 25-nucleotide gap at the fork junction followed by strand extension using the Klenow fragment (exo–) thus generating a 400-bp double strand (ds) tail on a 3.4-kb duplex circle (Fig. 1). The ds tail represents the lagging strand where one arm of the circle is the leading strand, and the other arm is the parental strand. By EM, we found that 95% of the molecules scored had ds tails that had an average length of 390 ± 80 bp (n = 280).p53 Binds to the Junction of Replication Forks—To examine p53 binding to replication forks, ds tailed templates were incubated with the protein (1:4 molar ratio of DNA/p53 tetramers), and the reaction products were analyzed by EM. The results showed that 69.4 ± 1.7% of the DNA molecules were bound by p53 (n = 240, three independent experiments). Binding to the junction of replication forks (Fig. 2, A and B) was observed in 69.7 ± 6.2% of the protein-bound molecules, whereas 11.6 ± 4.0% had protein associated with the circle or tail. Interestingly, a fraction of the molecules (10.6 ± 4.1%) were p53-bound but had 2 shorter ds tails associated with the complex at the replication fork junction (Fig. 2, C and D). The sum of the length of the 2 short tails measured ∼ 400 bp, which is the same as the tail length of the initial substrate. These structures were not observed in the absence of p53. Incubation with the checkpoint protein, claspin, as well as the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 complex did not produce these double-tailed molecules (Ref. 33Sar F. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Subramanian D. Croteau D.L. Hutsell S.Q. Griffith J.D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39289-39295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, data not shown). We believe these structures to be products of fork regression reactions thus creating chickenfoot intermediates. One possible mechanism of chickenfoot formation would involve p53-induced regression in molecules that it recognizes as stalled replication forks. Alternately, the substrates could undergo spontaneous branch migration resulting in products where the ds tail has moved to a new position that is 400 bp from the original site. In the absence of p53 this may occur rapidly, and the only molecules observed would be the initial template and the final product. Addition of p53 could result in trapping chickenfoot intermediates formed during the migration, thus preventing further strand movement. Both processes represent mechanisms by which p53 can signal the presence of stalled replication forks. On circular molecules, the products of complete regression cannot be distinguished by EM from the original templates, and therefore these substrates cannot be used to determine the total fraction of regressed forks, whether spontaneous or p53-induced.FIGURE 2p53 interactions with stalled replication forks. Circular replication forks were incubated with p53, and products were visualized by electron microscopy. Samples were mounted onto thin carbon-coated copper grids and rotary shadowcasted with tungsten. A and B, p53 bound to the junction of replication forks. C and D, p53 bound to chickenfoot intermediates. Images are shown in reverse contrast. The bar is equivalent to 400 bp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)p53 Induces Regression of Stalled Replication Forks—By converting the duplex circles into linear molecules, the position of the ds tail can be determined by measuring the length of the segments on either side of the tail. Templates were synthesized as described above followed by digestion of the circle with XmnI to produce asymmetrical arms that measure 1.05 kb (short) and 2.35 kb (long). If complete regression occurs, then the position of the ds tail should move by 400 bp, and the segments will measure 1.45 and 1.95 kb, respectively. Control reactions were carried out in the absence of p53, and the length of the short segment was measured to determine the position of the tail. Molecules were sorted into three categories: unregressed (short segment = 1.05 ± 0.075 kb), fully regressed (short segment = 1.45 ± 0.075 kb), and partially regressed (short segment with intermediate lengths between unregressed and fully regressed). The results show that 81% of the molecules measured (n = 100) had short arms of 1.05 ± 0.075 kb (that is, they had not regressed), whereas 17% were fully regressed. The remaining 2% had short segments of intermediate length, but no double-tailed structures were observed in these molecules presumably because one of the tails was too short to be visualized by EM. These results indicate that a fraction of the templates undergoes spontaneous regression; however, in the absence of p53, regression mostly progresses to completion. This is similar to the observation by Yoon et al. (26Yoon D. Wang Y. Stapleford K. Wiesmuller L. Chen J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 639-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that approximately 10–20% of their replication fork templates underwent reverse branch migration.Linear templates were incubated with p53 and scored for binding efficiency as well as tail position. Binding to linear templates showed patterns similar to circular templates, with 76.3 ± 4.9% of total molecules (n = 300, three independent reactions) bound by p53 (TABLE ONE). Most of the binding occurred at the fork junction (65%), whereas 8% of the molecules showed chickenfoot structures. The lengths of the short arms of p53-bound molecules (n = 100) were determined and sorted based on the tail position. Addition of p53 resulted in an increase in the number of completely regressed molecules from 17 to 26% (TABLE TWO). Furthermore, there was also a greater number (20%) of partially regressed molecules, which included chickenfoot structures. Not all partially regressed molecules had 2 visible tails, most likely because they were either obscured by the protein mass or the second strand was too small to be seen by EM. Indeed, the visible strand of these partially regressed molecules measured 311 ± 70 bp, making the second tail ∼80 bp in length, which would be easily missed by EM. Overall, the total number of regressed molecules (complete and partial) increased by 2.5-fold with the addition of p53 indicating that the protein can actively promote fork regression. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the partially regressed molecules are a result of p53 trapping intermediates of spontaneous regression.TABLE ONEp53 binding to stalled replication forksTemplateUnboundBoundp53JunctionChickenfootCircle or tailMultiple proteins% total% total% boundRF253723.7 ± 4.976.3 ± 4.964.9 ± 5.58.0 ± 3.021.1 ± 7.16.1 ± 2.9RF254235.7 ± 4.664.3 ± 4.663.3 ± 3.310.3 ± 1.717.1 ± 0.89.3 ± 3.8RF255527.7 ± 10.871.7 ± 10.462.5 ± 4.216.0 ± 2.317.1 ± 4.04.4 ± 2.2 Open table in a new tab TABLE TWOFork regression as a function of p53 bindingMoleculesTail positionRF2537RF2542RF2555-p53+p53-p53+p53-p53+p53% totalUnregressed (1.05 ± 0.075 kb)80.654.367.760.266.757.6Fully regressed (1.45 ± 0.075 kb)17.226.122.626.123.322.8Partially regressed (1.125-1.325 kb)2.219.69.713.68.919.6 Open table in a new tab p53 Binds Intermediates of Spontaneous Regression to Prevent Further Strand Movement—We observed that the amount of spontaneous regression in the templates could be altered by changing the temperature at which the second strand primer was annealed. The substrates used in the above experiments were synthesized by annealing the primer at 37 °C (RF2537). Additional templates were synthesized by increasing the annealing temperature to 42 °C (RF2542) and 55 °C (RF2555) followed by second strand synthesis and digestion with XmnI. In the absence of p53, both RF2542 and RF2555 showed greater levels of spontaneous regression (TABLE TWO). Completely regressed molecules increased to 23% in both cases (compared with 17% with RF2537), whereas partially regressed molecules increased to ∼10% (compared with 2% with RF2537). p53 bound to these new templates with the same efficiency as RF2537 and showed similar binding patterns (TABLE ONE) except for increased chickenfoot structures (16%) with RF2555. Measurement of the short segment following p53 addition showed that ∼25% of both templates had tails positioned at 1.45 ± 0.075 kb on the linear template, i.e. they were completely regressed. This is not significantly different from the untreated templates. However, an increase in the number of partially regressed molecules (including chickenfoot molecules) was observed with the addition of p53, from 10 to 14% with RF2542 and from 9 to 20% with RF2555. In the case of RF2542, the total amount of regression (complete and partial) increased from 33 to 40% with the addition of p53, whereas with RF2555, it increased from 32 to 42%. These data suggest that with these two templates, the majority of observed chickenfoot molecules resulted from p53 trapping intermediates of spontaneous regression, and the contribution from active fork regression by the protein was not as great. However, with the RF2537, where spontaneous regression is not as high, p53 appears to switch functions and induce fork regression.Mutants of p53 Do Not Recognize Stalled Replication Forks—Certain mutations in p53 can result in an increase in genomic rearrangements in vivo, making cells more cancer-prone. We tested two such p53 mutants (175H and 273H) for their ability to recognize stalled replication forks as well as the four-stranded intermediates. To examine the ability of the two p53 mutants to bind four-stranded structures, mobility shift assays were performed using probes resembling Holliday junctions. We have shown previously that wild type p53 binds to these structures with high affinity (30Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2427-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, the two p53 mutants bound poorly to these probes (Fig. 3) with the 273H mutant showing slightly higher affinity than the 175H mutant.FIGURE 3Binding of p53 mutants to Holliday junctions. End-labeled probes (9 nm) were incubated with either 90 or 180 nm wild type p53 (lanes 2 and 3), mutant 173H (lanes 4 and 5), or mutant 273H (lanes 6 and 7), and reaction products were separated on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography.

Among them, one of the most strongly down-regulated in epithelial TIS7-overexpressing cells was OPN (–2.9-fold; see Table I in Ref. 3Vietor I. Vadivelu S.K. Wick N. Hoffman R. Cotten M. Seiser C.

This result was also confirmed by an independent real-time PCR technique (-2.1-fold (3Vietor I. Vadivelu S.K. Wick N. Hoffman R. Cotten M. Seiser C. Fialka I. Wunderlich W. Haase A. Korinkova G. Brosch G. Huber L.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4621-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). We have shown recently that TIS7 is capable of specific transcriptional repression in a HDAC-dependent manner, since it can interact with mSin3B and HDAC1, as well as other members of the HDAC complex (3Vietor I. Vadivelu S.K. Wick N. Hoffman R. Cotten M. Seiser C. Fialka I. Wunderlich W. Haase A. Korinkova G. Brosch G. Huber L.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4621-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Using bioinformatic analysis we have further identified a common binding site for the C/EBPα-Sp1 transcription factor “module” within the upstream regulatory regions of TIS7-regulated genes, OPN among them (4Wick N. Schleiffer A. Huber L.A. Vietor I. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our experimental data showed that TIS7 inhibits the expression of target genes through its inhibitory effect on the Sp1 portion of this module (4Wick N. Schleiffer A. Huber L.A. Vietor I. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We have recently generated by homologous recombination mice lacking the tis7 gene (5Vadivelu S.K. Kurzbauer R. Dieplinger B. Zweyer M. Schafer R. Wernig A. Vietor I. Huber L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3514-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Disruption of the tis7 gene delayed muscle regeneration and altered isometric contractile properties of skeletal muscles after muscle crush damage in TIS7–/– mice. We found reduced expression of myogenic marker genes such as MyoD, myogenin, and laminin-α2 in the TIS7–/– mice. In general, these mice and muscle satellite cells isolated from them display a migration, differentiation, cell cycle, and apoptosis phenotype. Therefore we wanted to know whether the OPN gene expression is up-regulated in TIS7–/– animals. Since we have previously shown that TIS7 regulates gene expression via interaction with histone deacetylases, and it was shown recently that β-catenin transcriptional activity is activated by the histone acetyl transferase p300 (6Levy L. Wei Y. Labalette C. Wu Y. Renard C.A. Buendia M.A. Neuveut C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3404-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), our additional goal was to analyze the possible mechanism of OPN transcriptional regulation by TIS7 regulated acetylation of the β-catenin transcriptional complex.OPN is a glyco-phosphoprotein that functions in cell adhesion, chemotaxis, stress-dependent angiogenesis, prevention of apoptosis, and anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells by regulating cell-matrix interactions and cellular signaling through binding with integrin and CD44 receptors. While constitutive expression of OPN exists in several cell types, induced expression has been detected in tumor cells. Substantial evidence has linked OPN with the regulation of metastatic spread by tumor cells (reviewed in Refs. 7Wai P.Y. Kuo P.C. J. Surg. Res. 2004; 121: 228-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar and 8Standal T. Borset M. Sundan A. Exp. Oncol. 2004; 26: 179-184PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that regulate the OPN expression are incompletely understood and therefore its transcriptional regulators may be of interest as potential modulators of the OPN-mediated phenotypes such as angiogenesis, apoptosis, inflammation, wound healing, tumor metastasis, adhesion, migration, and cell survival. Deletion and mutagenesis analyses of the OPN promoter region identified a proximal promoter element that is essential for maintaining high levels of OPN expression in the tumor cells. This element contains binding sites for transcription factors Sp1, the glucocorticoid receptor, the E-box-binding factors, and the octamer motif-binding protein (9Wang D. Yamamoto S. Hijiya N. Benveniste E.N. Gladson C.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5801-5809Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10El-Tanani M. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P.S. Campbell F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20794-20806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that c-Myc and OCT-1 proteins participate in forming DNA-protein complexes with the OPN-binding elements. These elements in the OPN promoter act synergistically to promote up-regulation of OPN synthesis by tumor cells (9Wang D. Yamamoto S. Hijiya N. Benveniste E.N. Gladson C.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5801-5809Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since activated β-catenin and OPN overexpression coincide (11Nagai S. Hashimoto S. Yamashita T. Toyoda N. Satoh T. Suzuki T. Matsushima K. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) in migrating cells (12Muller T. Bain G. Wang X. Papkoff J. Exp. Cell. Res. 2002; 280: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), OPN may be a transcriptional target of the β-catenin-T cell factor (Tcf) complex (13El-Tanani M. Barraclough R. Wilkinson M.C. Rudland P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5619-5629PubMed Google Scholar). The c-Myc oncogene was identified as a target gene of the β-catenin-Tcf complex signaling pathway. Mutations of adenomatous polyposis coli cause aberrant accumulation of β-catenin, which then binds T cell factor-4 (Tcf-4), causing increased transcriptional activation of downstream target genes. Expression of c-Myc was shown to be repressed by wild-type adenomatous polyposis coli and activated by β-catenin, and these effects were mediated through Tcf-4-binding sites in the c-Myc promoter (14He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4047) Google Scholar).Here we identified that OPN transcription is up-regulated in cells and tissues derived from homozygous mice lacking the TIS7 gene. In transactivation assays, using a specific reporter construct and combination of histone acetyl transferase or deacetylase transfection and treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitor we show that increased TIS7 expression negatively regulates the β-catenin/Tcf/Lef-mediated transcriptional activation. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments we show that TIS7 possesses the capacity to increase the amount of the histone deacetylase bound to β-catenin. Our histone acetylase activity assays document that this β-catenin co-immunoprecipitated HDAC is even enzymatically active. Furthermore, in a specific gene expression analysis we have identified c-Myc, a known β-catenin downstream target gene to be up-regulated in TIS7–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Based on these experimental data we propose that TIS7 regulates the OPN expression most probably through acetylation-dependent changes in β-catenin transcriptional activity affecting the c-Myc expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—TIS7 mouse embryonic fibroblasts were immortalized according to the NIH 3T3 protocol and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 1% l-glutamine. The 293 cell line was from the ATCC and was cultured in minimal essential medium-α with 10% newborn calf serum. C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine. Stocks of C2C12 were kept less than 30% confluent as they tend to fuse when too confluent. C2C12 stocks were grown for about six passages, and then a new vial was thawed as C2C12 cells fuse less with higher passages.Plasmids—The cloning of full-length mTIS7 into the pcDNA3.1(–)/MycHis (Invitrogen) and pcDNA3.1(–) with a C-terminal Myc9-tag plasmids were described previously (3Vietor I.

Protein samples isolated in parallel were used for Western blot analysis of protein expression. Primer sequences for the amplification of OPN were: GAC CAT GAG ATT GGC AGT GAT TTG (forward primer) and GTT TCG GTC GGA TGT AGT (reverse primer); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), CGG AGT CAA CGG ATT TGG TCG TAT (forward primer) and AGC CTT CTC CAT GGT GGT GAA GAC (reverse primer); and for c-Myc, ATC TGC GAC GAG GAA GAG AA (forward primer) and ATC GCA GAT GAA GCT CTG GT (reverse primer). SYBR-Green-detected PCR was performed with the Opticon MJ Research™ (with software Opticon Monitor Version 1.08) using the reagents and protocol as published previously (19Yin J.L. Shackel N.A.

For the amplification the following program was used: denaturation, 2 min at 95 °C; amplification, 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. This cycle was repeated 39 times. Fluorescence was detected after each elongation step at an optimal temperature to obtain specific signal only. The amplification specificity was determined from the melting curve after each run. Correct amplicon size and identity were confirmed by gel analysis and sequencing. Fluorescence intensity was plotted against cycle number on a logarithmic scale. All samples were analyzed in parallel with standards. Cycle number when fluorescent signal was first detected was plotted against copy number derived from standard curves. Average data for specific PCR products were normalized to values of GAPDH and also on the PCR reaction efficiency using proprietary software from the company Biozym (supplier of the real-time PCR system Opticon).Antibodies—Raising and purification of the rabbit antiserum to TIS7 was described previously (3Vietor I. Vadivelu S.K. Wick N. Hoffman R. Cotten M. Seiser C. Fialka I. Wunderlich W. Haase A. Korinkova G. Brosch G. Huber L.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4621-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal affinity purified α-Myc antibodies were from Gramsch Laboratories (Schwabhausen, Germany). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Xpress epitope were from Invitrogen, against β-catenin from Transduction Laboratories, and against HA epitope tag from Babco, Inc. Mouse monoclonal α-HDAC1 antibodies were prepared in the laboratory of C. Seiser. Rabbit polyclonal α-HDAC4 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology.HDAC Activity Assay—HDAC activity was determined as described previously (16Bartl S. Taplick J. Lagger G. Khier H. Kuchler K. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol.

Acta. 1996; 1296: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) using [3H]acetate-prelabeled chicken reticulocyte histones as substrate. To measure HDAC enzymatic activity equal amounts of immunoprecipitates obtained from 375 μl of whole cell lysates were used. Sample aliquots of 50 μl were mixed with 10 μl of total [3H]acetate-prelabeled chicken reticulocyte histones (1 mg/ml) yielding ∼35,000 cpm. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 1 m HCl, 0.4 m acetyl acetate, and 0.8 ml of ethyl acetate. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min an aliquot of 600 μl of the upper phase was counted for radioactivity in 3 ml of liquid scintillation mixture.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed on ice in HDAC activity assay buffer as described previously (16Bartl S. Taplick J. Lagger G. Khier H. Kuchler K. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged to separate insoluble proteins. Equal amounts of soluble proteins were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of the respective antibodies followed by 10 μl of (1:1) protein G-agarose slurry (Ultralink, Pierce). Following four washes with the lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with the sample buffer and boiling. Luciferase assay lysates were used for documentation of protein expression performed by analysis. Western blots for all but HDAC4 antibodies were performed as described previously (21Vietor I. Bader T. Paiha K. Huber L.A. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Western blot with HDAC4 antibodies was performed strictly according to the manufacturer's protocol.Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assay—All transient transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). pTOPflash, pFOPflash, or OPN-pGL3 luciferase reporter constructs were used as a reporter constructs. Expression constructs or empty vector DNA used as a control were co-transfected. pCMV-β-Gal plasmid expressing β-galactosidase protein was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. The total amount of transfected DNA (2 μg of DNA per well) was equalized by addition of empty vector DNA. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection in 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100 buffer and assayed for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. Transfections were performed in triplicates, and all experiments were repeated several times.RESULTSTIS7 Inhibits the OPN Gene Expression—In our previous study (3Vietor I. Vadivelu S.K. Wick N. Hoffman R. Cotten M. Seiser C. Fialka I. Wunderlich W. Haase A. Korinkova G. Brosch G. Huber L.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4621-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) of the transcriptional regulatory effects of the TIS7 protein we have identified a group of predominantly down-regulated genes following the overexpression of TIS7 in mouse epithelial cells. Among these the expression of OPN (secreted phosprotein I; GenBank™ accession number AA 108928) was significantly down-regulated (–2.9-fold). Second, we have identified that homozygous TIS7–/– mice display a muscle regeneration phenotype and decreased expression of certain genes, important for muscle differentiation. Therefore the OPN gene expression was tested by real-time PCR analysis in RNA samples isolated from quadriceps muscles of TIS7+/+ and TIS7–/–, respectively. The OPN expression in 3-month-old TIS7–/– animals was 29.7-fold higher than in the control group of TIS7+/+ animals of the same age (Fig. 1A).In the next experiment we have measured the OPN gene expression in representative clones of the TIS7+/+ and TIS7–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (22Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell. Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1990) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1B is shown a real-time PCR result of a representative experiment performed in TIS7+/+ clone #3 and TIS7–/– clone #9. The OPN gene expression was 2.5-fold increased in the TIS7–/– MEFs when compared with the TIS7+/+ MEFs.We were then interested to know whether the increase in OPN RNA levels is caused by up-regulation of RNA synthesis through the binding elements of specific transcription factors. Therefore, we analyzed the OPN transcriptional activity using a luciferase reporter construct driven by an OPN-specific promoter (10El-Tanani M. Platt-Higgins A. Rudland P.S. Campbell F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20794-20806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) transiently transfected into TIS7 MEFs (TIS7+/+ clone #3 and TIS7–/– clone #9). The constitutive levels of OPN transcriptional activity were 6-fold increased in TIS7–/– MEFs when compared with the TIS7+/+ MEFs (Fig. 1C). OPN was recently identified as one of the β-catenin/Tcf-4 transcriptional signaling targets (13El-Tanani M. Barraclough R. Wilkinson M.C. Rudland P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5619-5629PubMed Google Scholar, 23El-Tanani M.K. Barraclough R. Wilkinson M.C. Rudland P.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1793-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To test whether TIS7 regulates OPN expression through the β-catenin/Tcf/Lef transcriptional pathway in addition to the previously shown C/EBPα-Sp1 transcription factor module we tested the activity of an OPN-luciferase-reporter with mutated Tcf-binding sites. Both, mutation of a single as well as two Tcf-binding sites in the OPN promoter effectively abolished Lef-1 and Lef-1/β-catenin enhancement of the OPN promoter-reporter activity (Fig. 1C). These novel data indicated that TIS7 regulates the OPN expression mainly through the cooperative activity of the β-catenin/Tcf signaling pathway and only partially through the C/EBPα-Sp1 transcription factor module (4Wick N. Schleiffer A. Huber L.A. Vietor I. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).According to our previously published data TIS7 expression affects not only muscle regeneration but also cell cycle progression under differentiation conditions. TIS7–/– muscle satellite cells (MSCs) in culture continue to proliferate under low mitogen (differentiation-stimulating) conditions that normally induce cell cycle withdrawal and terminal differentiation of TIS7+/+ MSCs (5Vadivelu S.K. Kurzbauer R. Dieplinger B. Zweyer M. Schafer R. Wernig A. Vietor I. Huber L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3514-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Higher number of TIS7–/– than of TIS7+/+ MSCs stayed in S-phase (5Vadivelu S.K. Kurzbauer R. Dieplinger B. Zweyer M. Schafer R. Wernig A. Vietor I. Huber L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3514-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since c-Myc is an OPN promoter-binding protein regulating OPN expression (9Wang D. Yamamoto S. Hijiya N. Benveniste E.N. Gladson C.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5801-5809Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a known regulator of the cell cycle progression, and one of the best known β-catenin/Tcf-4 transcriptional targets (14He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4047) Google Scholar), we decided to measure c-Myc expression in TIS7+/+ and TIS7–/– MEFs. Interestingly, c-Myc gene expression, as measured by the real-time PCR, was 3-fold increased in TIS7–/– MEFs when compared with the TIS7+/+ MEFs (Fig. 1D).TIS7 Inhibits β-Catenin/Tcf/LEF-mediated Transcriptional Activation —Our previous work identified TIS7 as a transcriptional co-repressor (3Vietor I. Vadivelu S.K. Wick N. Hoffman R. Cotten M. Seiser C. Fialka I. Wunderlich W. Haase A. Korinkova G. Brosch G. Huber L.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4621-4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have shown here that TIS7 inhibits OPN as well as c-Myc gene expression. Since c-Myc is a known downstream target of β-catenin and Tcf/Lef-mediated transcriptional activation (14He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4047) Google Scholar), we have measured the transcriptional activity of this complex in TIS7+/+ and TIS7–/– MEF clones. Several independent MEF clones were transiently co-transfected with a Tcf-4-responsive pTOPflash luciferase reporter. The transcriptional activity was almost doubled in all TIS7–/– MEF when compared with the TIS7+/+ tested clones (numbers of tested independent clones as shown in the figure legend) (Fig. 2A). The TOPflash transcriptional activity was repeatedly measured in several passages of the two representative clones TIS7+/+ clone #3 and TIS7–/– clone #9. One representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2B. The TOPflash transcriptional activity was 4.8-fold increased in the TIS7–/– clone #9 when compared with the TIS7+/+ clone #3 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore we were interested to know whether TIS7 overexpression would revert the increased β-catenin/Tcf/Lef transcriptional activity of this clone. The cells were co-transfected with the reporter plasmid as before and additionally with β-catenin and TIS7 expression plasmids, respectively, as indicated in the legend of the graph. TIS7 overexpression completely abolished the β-catenin-induced transcriptional activity (Fig. 2C). Many features of OPN expression are cell type-specific; therefore we evaluated the transcriptional responses in C2C12 murine skeletal myoblast cell line. C2C12 cells, like the muscle satellite cells, exhibit multiple cellular potentials and readily fuse to form contractile myotubes in culture. We have co-transfected proliferating C2C12 cells with the TOPflash reporter plasmid, β-catenin, and TIS7 expression plasmids, respectively, as indicated in the legend of the graph. TIS7 overexpression inhibited the β-catenin/Tef/Lef transcriptional activity also in the C2C12 myoblasts documenting that this is not a cell line-specific effect (Fig. 2D). Moreover, additional experiments in human embryonic kidney 293 cells documented a dose-dependent effect of the TIS7-stimulated transcriptional inhibition (supplemental Fig. 1).FIGURE 2TIS7 inhibits β-catenin/Tcf-4 transcriptional activity. A, TIS7+/+ or TIS7–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were transiently co-transfected with the pTOPflash luciferase reporter andβ-galactosidase expression vector. 48 h after the transfection luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured. The experiment was repeated with several independent clones as indicated by the legend. Mean and standard deviations are shown. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized on transfection efficiency using the β-galactosidase values. B, the experiment was repeated three times with two particular MEF clones (TIS7+/+ clone #3 and TIS7–/– clone #9); mean and standard deviation are shown. Results were normalized and evaluated as described for A. C, TIS7–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (TIS7–/– clone #9) were transiently co-transfected with the pTOPflash luciferase reporter, β-galactosidase, β-catenin, and TIS7 expression vectors (3 μg of plasmid DNA per well) as indicated by the legend. Results were normalized and evaluated as described for A. D, C2C12 mur"

The mammalian homologues of yeast Class C type of vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) proteins appear to control the fusion events of late endosomes and lysosomes that are the major pathway of the intracellular protein degradation (6Kim B.Y. Kramer H. Yamamoto A. Kominami E. Kohsaka S. Akazawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29393-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Sato T.K. Rehling P. Peterson M.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). There are four genes in human Class C VPS: hVPS11, hVPS16, hVPS18, and hVPS33. Studies of the domains of hVPS11 and hVPS18 have consistently revealed the existence of a RING-H2 motif, a member of RING fingers, located near the C-terminal. RING-H2 finger domains are present in a wide variety of proteins, and in the recent past it has been found that several RING-H2 finger proteins take part in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by playing as E3 ubiquitin ligases. The ubiquitin conjugation has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including cell-cycle control, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and cell death (8Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 9Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the conjugation with ubiquitin also serves as a sorting signal that determines the destination of various proteins at the different subcellular organelles such as the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi network, and the endosome (10Schnell J.D. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35857-35860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The conjugation of ubiquitin to substrate proteins requires at least three enzymes: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). The RING-H2 finger is a zinc binding domain with an octet of cysteines and histidines with a defined space representing the largest class of ubiquitin ligases to date. For instance, mammalian genomes encode hundreds of RING finger proteins, and it has not yet been clear whether all of these proteins have E3 activity or not (11Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10 (-R87): R84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, a number of molecules are waiting for characterization that may help us to understand how the intracellular protein levels are controlled. Despite the recent investigation of the Class C VPS in the membrane traffic of the yeast and mammals, the molecular mechanisms remain undefined. In this report, we demonstrate that hVPS18 is a genuine ubiquitin ligase E3 and search in the rat brain for interacting molecules with hVPS18 using the yeast two-hybrid screen. Here we identified SNK as one of the candidate substrates of the ubiquitin ligase activity of hVPS18. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen and cDNA Cloning—For the yeast two-hybrid screen, the yeast strain AH109 was transformed sequentially with pGBKT7-hVPS18, as a bait, and a cDNA library of the rat brain (BD Biosciences Clontech) using the lithium acetate method. We screened 2 × 106 transformants on the plate containing synthetic dropout medium lacking histidine, tryptophan, and leucine. Positive clones were selected on 5 mm 3-aminotriazole-containing medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and verified with a filter assay for β-galactosidase activity. The prey plasmids were recovered and sequenced. The full-length SNK was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR from the rat brain cDNA. We assessed the interaction of hVPS18 and rat SNK in AH109 cells transformed sequentially with pGBKT7-hVPS18 (full-length or ΔRING) and pGADT7 containing SNK or clone #A12-1 by quantifying β-galactosidase activity. Plasmid Construction—Full-length and various truncated SNK cDNAs were subcloned into the following vectors: the pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) prokaryotic expression vector for the production of GST-tagged fusion proteins; the pCMV-HA, pCMV-FLAG, and pCMV-Myc mammalian expression vectors (BD Biosciences Clontech) for the production of HA-tagged, FLAG-tagged, and Myc-tagged fusion proteins. Myc-tagged and HA-tagged hVPSs (hVPS11, hVPS18, hVPS18ΔRING, hVPS16, and hVPS33a) mammalian expression vectors were prepared as described previously (6Kim B.Y. Kramer H. Yamamoto A. Kominami E.

The full-length hVPSs (hVPS11, hVPS18, and hVPS16) were subcloned into pFastBacHTb insect expression vector (Invitrogen) to generate His-tagged hVPSs.

The supernatant, after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, was used for the ubiquitylation reaction. Full-length and various truncated mutants of GST-SNK were expressed in E. coli strain BL21-AI, and the recombinant proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete protease inhibitor mixture. His-tagged hVPSs (hVPS11, hVPS18, and hVPS16) were expressed in Sf9 insect cells using baculovirus protein expression system (Invitrogen), and the recombinant proteins were purified by using ProBond metal affinity beads (Invitrogen) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 mm NaCl. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—COS7, HeLa, and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in humidified incubators with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were transfected with various plasmids by FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies—His-tagged full-length rat SNK was expressed in Sf9 cells. The protein was purified by ProBond metal affinity resin and used as immunogens in Wistar rats. The affinity purification using His-SNK coupled to a HiTrap NHS-activated column (Amersham Biosciences) was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. The rabbit anti-SNK polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. M. H. Sheng. Anti-hVPS antibodies (hVPS11, hVPS16, and hVPS18) were prepared as described previously (6Kim B.Y. Kramer H. Yamamoto A. Kominami E. Kohsaka S. Akazawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29393-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used were as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (3F10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (Sigma), and mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (B-5-1-2, Sigma). Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 3 mm EDTA) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Total cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatants was determined. Identical amounts of the protein from each sample were precleared by incubation with protein A/G Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C. After the removal of protein A/G-Sepharose by brief centrifugation, the solution was incubated with 2 μg of monoclonal anti-Myc antibody, monoclonal anti-HA antibody, or control IgGs at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitation of the antigen-antibody complex was accomplished by adding 40 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Sepharose-bound proteins were solubilized in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analyses were performed. In Vitro Pull-down Assay—Full-length and various truncated mutants of GST-SNK were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and equilibrated with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for three times. The resin was incubated with His-tagged hVPSs at 25 °C for 30 min and washed with the wash buffer for three times. The resin was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analyses were performed by either anti-hVPS18 antibody, anti-hVPS11 antibody, or anti-hVPS16 antibody. In Vivo and in Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—Myc-tagged hVPS18, hVPS11, hVPS16, FLAG-tagged SNK, and HA-tagged ubiquitin were co-transfected to COS7 cells using FuGENE 6. Transfected cells were treated with 30 μm MG132 for 3 h at 16 h post-transfection. Immunoprecipitation was performed by using anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose, and conjugated HA-ubiquitin was detected by Western blot analyses using anti-HA antibody. An in vitro ubiquitylation assay was performed as described previously (12Yogosawa S. Miyauchi Y. Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). GST-SNK full-length was mixed with yeast E1 (500 ng, Boston Biochem), E2-enzyme mixture (Boston Biochem), or UbcH4, ubiquitin (10 μg, Boston Biochem) and His-hVPS18. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP in a 50-μl volume. After incubation, the mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analyses using anti-GST antibody, anti-ubiquitin antibody, or anti-hVPS18 antibody. Establishment of HeLa Cell Lines Up-regulates/Down-regulates hVPS18 by Lentivirus Vector—The lentivirus containing full-length of hVPS18 or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference was raised by the method previously described (13Katayama K. Wada K. Miyoshi H. Ohashi K. Tachibana M. Furuki R. Mizuguchi H. Hayakawa T. Nakajima A. Kadowaki T. Tsutsumi Y. Nakagawa S. Kamisaki Y. Mayumi T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 560: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, synthetic oligonucleotides (top-strand: 5′-GATCCCCAGGTGTCCATCTTCGCAAAGCGTGTGCTGTCCGCTTTGTGAAGATGGGCACTTTTTTTGGAAAT-3′; bottom-strand: 5′-CTAGATTTCCAAAAAAAGTGCCCATCTTCACAAAGCGGACAGCACACGCTTTGCGAAGATGGACACCTGGG-3′; underline, loop sequence) were annealed and ligated into the BglII-XbaI site of pENTR4-H1. The full length of hVPS18 cDNA was ligated into the EcoRI-XhoI site of pENTR3C. Then either pENTR4-H1-hVPS18-shRNA or pENTR3C/hVPS18 was incubated with pLent6/V5 DEST (Invitrogen) in the presence of Gateway LR Clonase (Invitrogen) for plasmid recombination. To obtain recombinant lentivirus, the Clonase-recombinated plasmid was co-transfected with packaging construct (pCAG-HIVgp), and vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein-expressing, Rev-expressing construct (pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev) to HEK293T cells. The titer of virus was determined by measuring the amount of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 p24 gag antigen using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The recombinant lentivirus (titer: 5 × 107 IU/ml) was infected to HeLa cells with 10 μg/ml Blasticidin S (Invitrogen) to select the virus-infected cells. The Blasticidin S-resistant colony was identified and expanded to establish the HeLa cell lines that constitutively overexpress hVPS18 (HeLa-hVPS18(OE)) or constitutively knock-down hVPS18 by shRNA interference (HeLa-hVPS18(shRNA)). Uo confirm the expression level of hVPS18 and SNK in the established HeLa cell lines, Western blot analyses and immunocytochemistry were performed as previously described (6Kim B.Y. Kramer H. Yamamoto A. Kominami E. Kohsaka S. Akazawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29393-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine and [35S]Cysteine Pulse-chase Analysis—Three lines of HeLa cells (Control, hVPS18(OE), and hVPS18(shRNA)) were subjected to the in vivo pulse-chase analyses using [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine. Each cell was washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times and incubated for 1 h with Met(-)/Cys(-)-DMEM without serum. The medium was then replaced with Met(-)/Cys(-)-DMEM containing 1 mCi of [35S]Met/[35S]Cys Express Protein Labeling Mixture (Amersham Biosciences) and 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation for 2 h, the medium was replaced with non-radioactive DMEM complete medium. Cells were then incubated for indicated chase time and harvested. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated, using anti-SNK antibody and protein A/G-Sepharose 4 fast flow. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by BAS5000 image analyzer (FUJI Film). Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cell cycle of HeLa cells was synchronized and released from G1/S arrest. Briefly, the cells were treated with 3 μg/ml aphidicolin and serum starvation for 14 h. Then, the cells were stimulated to progress the cell cycle by with 10% serum in the absence of aphidicolin for the indicated times. Prior to each harvest, the cells were labeled for 30 min in the presence of BrdUrd at the concentration of 10 μm. For immunostaining of BrdUrd-incorporated DNA, cells were treated as recommended by the manufacturer (BrdU Flow Kit, BD Biosciences). Subsequently, cells were stained with propidium iodide and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses based on DNA content. The each sample (1 × 106 cells) was analyzed by the cell-cycle distribution using FACStar cell sorter (BD Bioscience). RING-H2 Domain of hVPS18 Has a Ubiquitin Ligase Activity—It has been shown that hVPS18, a member of Class C VPS protein, has a RING-H2 finger domain in its C-terminal region (6Kim B.Y. Kramer H. Yamamoto A. Kominami E. Kohsaka S. Akazawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29393-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To examine whether hVPS18 has a ubiquitin ligase activity, we performed in vitro ubiquitylation assay using an E. coli lysate as an anonymous substrate. Because Nedd4 has a HECT (homologous to E6-associated protein carboxy terminus) type ubiquitin ligase activity, we used Nedd4 as a positive control of E3 activity (Fig. 1A, lane 7). As shown in Fig. 1A, the ubiquitylated proteins were detected in the presence of E1, E2-enzyme mixture, hVPS18, ubiquitin (Fig. 1A, lane 6) but not detected in the absence of either E1, E2, hVPS18, or E. coli lysate (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-5). Therefore, hVPS18 has a ubiquitin ligase activity using bacterial proteins as substrates. In a series of ubiquitylation pathways, it is required for the specific interaction between E3, E2, and substrate, to transfer ubiquitins to a target substrate. To examine the selectivity and the specificity of E2 enzymes for hVPS18, we performed in vitro ubiquitylation assay using various E2 enzymes. As shown in Fig. 1B, hVPS18 has a preference for UbcH4 (Fig. 1B, lane 5). Moreover, we examine whether RING-H2 domain of hVPS18 is responsible for ubiquitin ligase activity. As shown in Fig. 1C, hVPS18ΔRING does not have ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro (Fig. 1C, lane 3), suggesting that VPS18 functions as a ubiquitin ligase depending on its RING-H2 domain. Identification of SNK That Interacts with hVPS18—To explore the interacting proteins with hVPS18, we screened the rat brain cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid using the full-length human hVPS18 cDNA as a bait. From the screening of 2 × 106 clones, we obtained some rat clones encoding the homologues of hVPS11, hVPS16, and hVPS33a (data not shown), that have been shown to constitute a hetero-oligomeric complex with hVPS18, confirming the validity of this screen. Four of the positive clones, two identical clones (clone #A12-1, Fig. 2A) and two independents, have a sequence identity with the rat SNK cDNA (accession number: NM_031821), which was previously characterized as a new type of serine/threonine kinase highly induced in the presence of serum and stimuli that produce synaptic plasticity (14Simmons D.L. Neel B.G. Stevens R. Evett G. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Kauselmann G. Weiler M. Wulff P. Jessberger S. Konietzko U. Scafidi J. Staubli U. Bereiter-Hahn J. Strebhardt K. Kuhl D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5528-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). SNK is one of the Plks that associate with cell cycle (16Warnke S. Kemmler S. Hames R.S. Tsai H.L. Hoffmann-Rohrer U. Fry A.M. Hoffmann I. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1200-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Ma S. Liu M.A. Yuan Y.L. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 376-384PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ma S. Charron J. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6936-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The full-length SNK cDNA revealed that SNK is a 682-amino acid protein with calculated molecular mass of 77.8 kDa, containing kinase domain at the N-terminal regions and polo-box domain (PBD) at the C-terminal regions (14Simmons D.L. Neel B.G. Stevens R. Evett G. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 19Glover D.M. Ohkura H. Tavares A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1681-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We further confirmed the interaction of hVPS18 and SNK using the two-hybrid assays. Results of β-galactosidase color reaction were summarized in Fig. 2B. The clone A12-1 and full-length SNK bind to both the full-length hVPS18 (FL) and hVPS18 lacking RING-H2 domain (ΔRING), but not to hVPS18 lacking the C-terminal coiled-coil domain and RING-H2 domain (ΔCC2ΔRING). This suggests that hVPS18 interacts with SNK through the second coiled-coil domain. hVPS18 Interacts with SNK in Vitro and in Vivo—To answer the question whether the full-length SNK interacts with hVPS18, we performed immunoprecipitation assays. HEK293T cells were transfected with Myc-SNK and HA-tagged hVPS11, hVPS18, hVPS16, and hVPS33a, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3A, SNK was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with hVPS18 and the other Class C VPS. Please note that the interaction between SNK and hVPS18 is strongest among other members of Class C VPS complex. To further confirm the association of SNK and the Class C VPS in vitro, we performed an in vitro pull-down assay. The bacterial expressed GST-SNK was immobilized on glutathione beads, and insect-expressed His-tagged hVPS11, hVPS18, and hVPS16 were loaded. As shown in Fig. 3B (lanes 1-6), in a good agreement with the data obtained in the yeast two-hybrid screen, GST-SNK preferentially interact with His-hVPS18. As shown in Fig. 3B (lanes 7-12), hVPS11 and hVPS16 were retained with GST-SNK in the presence of hVPS18. These results suggest that the interaction between SNK and other Class C VPS in co-immunoprecipitation assay is partly mediated by hVPS18, and all of the Class C VPS proteins may constitute a large hetero-oligomeric complex in vivo (6Kim B.Y. Kramer H. Yamamoto A. Kominami E. Kohsaka S. Akazawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29393-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because the highly conserved PBD plays an important role for the correct subcellular localization and molecular interaction, we performed in vitro pull-down assays using the bacterially expressed GST proteins fuse to the various deletion forms of SNK. As shown in Fig. 4, SNK full-length and deletion mutants containing PBD at the C-terminal regions, efficiently bind to hVPS18, indicated that the PBD of SNK is involved in protein-protein interaction consistent with previous report (20Elia A.E. Rellos P. Haire L.F. Chao J.W. Ivins F.J. Hoepker K. Mohammad D. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5757-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). VPS18 Ubiquitylates SNK in Vitro and in Vivo—To answer the question whether SNK is ubiquitylated by hVPS18, we performed ubiquitylation assays of SNK in vivo and in vitro. COS7 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged SNK, and various combinations of Myc-tagged hVPS18, hVPS11, and hVPS16, in the presence or absence of HA-tagged ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 5A, SNK was heavily conjugated with HA-ubiquitin in the cells overexpressing hVPS18 (Fig. 5A, lane 3). The faint smearing in lanes 2, 4, and 5 suggests the possibility that SNK was ubiquitylated by endogenous VPS18 or other anonymous E3 of COS7 cells. It is necessary to observe the direct ubiquitylation of SNK by hVPS18 in vitro, we carried out ubiquitylation assays in which bacterially expressed GST-SNK proteins were incubated in the presence of E1, E2, His-hVPS18, ubiquitin, and ATP. As shown in Fig. 5B, SNK was ubiquitylated dependent on hVPS18, suggesting that SNK is one of the target substrates for hVPS18 E3 ubiquitin ligase. HeLa Cell Lines That Overexpress hVPS18 or Knockdown hVPS18—To characterize the physiological relation of SNK and hVPS18, we established HeLa cells that overexpress hVPS18 (HeLa-hVPS18(OE)) or shRNA interference of hVPS18 (HeLa-hVPS18(shRNA)) by lentivirus. After infection with the recombinant lentivirus, HeLa cells were treated with 10 μg/ml Blasticidin S, which is a selection antibiotic drug of the recombinant lentivirus infection. After 7-14 days of incubation with Blasticidin S, the resistant colony was isolated and expanded. To confirm the expression level of hVPS18 and SNK, Western blot analyses were performed. Compared with the control HeLa cell, the cells treated with shRNA interference lentivirus of hVPS18 show up-regulated expression of SNK. Conversely, the cells overexpressing hVPS18 show down-regulated SNK (Fig. 6A). To define the subcellular localization of SNK and hVPS18, immunohistochemistry was performed using established HeLa cell lines as shown in Fig. 6B. Up-regulated expression of SNK was observed in the cells that knocked down hVPS18 by shRNA interference lentivirus, whereas down-regulated expression of SNK was observed in the cells overexpressing hVPS18. The reciprocal level of expression between hVPS18 and SNK strongly suggests the endogenous SNK expression is regulated, at least in part, by hVPS18. To further analyze the role of hVPS18 in the SNK protein turnover, in vivo cell labeling by [35S]Met/[35S]Cys was performed. As shown in Fig. 7, the three lines of HeLa cells (control, hVPS18(OE), and hVPS18(shRNA)) were labeled and pulse-chased at five time points (0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min). The total cell lysates were incubated with rat anti-SNK antibody, and the immunoreactive bands were resolved by SDS-PAGE. In general, polyubiquitylated proteins are promptly subjected to degradation by 26 S proteasome. In a good accordance with our results that SNK is ubiquitinylated, the level of SNK protein degraded quickly (half-life, 20 min, Fig. 7B) as shown in the control HeLa cells. When hVPS18 was overexpressed, the degradation of SNK protein was enhanced (half-life, 13.5 min, Fig. 7B). Conversely, the degradation of SNK protein was retarded in the HeLa cells knocked-down hVPS18 expression (half-life, 45 min, Fig. 7B). The degradation pattern was reproducible by using the independent antibody against SNK provided by Dr. M. Sheng (data not shown). These results suggest that the degradation of endogenous SNK in HeLa cells can be regulated by the level of hVPS18 expression. Delayed Entry to S Phase When Overexpressed with hVPS18—Our hypothesis is that hVPS18 is involved in the degradation of SNK. It was previously reported that the kinase activity of SNK is required for centriole duplication close to the G1 to S phase transition (16Warnke S. Kemmler S. Hames R.S. Tsai H.L. Hoffmann-Rohrer U. Fry A.M. Hoffmann I. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1200-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cultured SNK-/- embryonic fibroblasts showed delayed entry to S phase (18Ma S. Charron J. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6936-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We thus examined the cell-cycle progression of HeLa cells overexpressing hVPS18. Although the profile of cell cycle between control HeLa cells and hVPS18 overexpressing HeLa cells was almost similar, the proportion of cells to S phase after 20 h was significantly lower than the control HeLa cells (Fig. 8). These results are in good accordance with the null mutant analyses and suggest that the expression level of hVPS18 may regulate the SNK protein level in vivo (18Ma S. Charron J. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6936-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The main findings of this study are that hVPS18 acts as a genuine ubiquitin ligase to induce the ubiquitylation and degradation of SNK using in vitro and in vivo experiments. The turnover of SNK protein was shortened by the overexpression of hVPS18, meanwhile the turnover was retarded by the shRNA interference of hVPS18. It suggests that the protein level of SNK is regulated by hVPS18. In HeLa cells overexpressing hVPS18, the delayed entry to S phase was observed during the cell-cycle progression. The targeted protein degradation has been increasingly understood to be a general mechanism by which cells properly regulate the intracellular protein levels. In eukaryotic cells, lysosomes/vacuoles are important organelles for the protein degradation. The Class C VPS complex has been intensively characterized as the molecules mediating the vesicle transport between late endosomes and lysosomes (6Kim B.Y. Kramer H. Yamamoto A. Kominami E. Kohsaka S. Akazawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29393-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Overexpression of VPS18 elicited abnormal perinuclear aggregation of late endosomes and lysosomes (22Sevrioukov E.A. He J.P. Moghrabi N. Sunio A. Kramer H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 479-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Knockdown of VPS18 by RNA interference resulted in dispersion of these organelles throughout the cell periphery (23Poupon V. Stewart A. Gray S.R. Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Mol. Bio. Cell. 2003; 14: 4015-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Taken together with our current results that hVPS18 functions as ubiquitin ligase, it is possible to propose an overlapped mechanism of protein degradations between endosome/lysosome and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways through hVPS18. hVPS18 contains several domains that are conserved in multiple species; a putative clathrin heavy chain repeat and coiled-coil domain that may mediate a protein-protein interaction, and C-terminal RING-H2 finger motif (6Kim B.Y. Kramer H. Yamamoto A. Kominami E. Kohsaka S. Akazawa C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29393-29402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The RING-H2 finger is a cysteine-rich, zinc-binding domain that is involved in diverse cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, RNA transport, signal transduction, and membrane trafficking (9Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar, 11Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10 (-R87): R84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are several lines of evidence showing that RING-H2 finger protein may function as a ubiquitin ligase. RING-H2 finger governs the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the protein substrate. From our in vitro experiments using anonymous substrates of E. coli, hVPS18 efficiently transferred ubiquitins from UbcH4. Because the recombinant hVPS18 devoid of RING-H2 did not show any E3 activity, the E3 activity of hVPS18 is dependent on its RING-H2 domain. In this report, we identified SNK as one of the target substrates for hVPS18 by the yeast two-hybrid screen. SNK was originally identified as an immediate-early transcript in NIH3T3 cells (14Simmons D.L. Neel B.G. Stevens R. Evett G. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences revealed that SNK is a member of Plks that are a family of serine/threonine kinases closely related to polo of Drosophila (24Hamanaka R. Maloid S. Smith M.R. O'Connell C.D. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 249-257PubMed Google Scholar). Plks have been identified in evolutionarily diversified eukaryotes, and they share a conserved N-terminal kinase domain and a homologous non-catalytic C terminus. A domain of ∼30 amino acid residues is highly conserved among these kinases and thus denoted as the polo-box domain (PBD) (19Glover D.M. Ohkura H. Tavares A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1681-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One of the functions of PBD was described as a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine binding domain that mediates the targeting of Plks to the subcellular structures such as centrosomes (20Elia A.E. Rellos P. Haire L.F. Chao J.W. Ivins F.J. Hoepker K. Mohammad D. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 83-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 25Elia A.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 299: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 26Jang Y.J. Lin C.Y. Ma S. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1984-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Previously, it was reported that endogenous SNK expression was regulated by the post-transcriptional level by showing the short half-life of ∼15 min (17Ma S. Liu M.A. Yuan Y.L. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 376-384PubMed Google Scholar). Such a short half-life is reasonable from our results that SNK was ubiquitylated and degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. But in the overexpression of full-length hVPS18, the SNK degradation is significantly enhanced. Our results suggest that hVPS18 regulates the protein level of SNK through its binding to the polo-domain and ubiquitylation of SNK. Activation of a number of protein kinases, such as protein kinase C (27Lu Z. Liu D. Hornia A. Devonish W. Pagano M. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), Src (28Hakak Y. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Harris K.F. Shoji I. Cooper E.M. Kumar S. Oda H. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13738-13743Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and ERK1/2 (30Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), results in ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation that is dependent on their kinase activity. Taken together, SNK is regulated by the two fundamental intracellular mechanisms, phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, that control its kinase activity and molecular abundance. Previous study revealed a functional role of SNK by establishing SNK-null mutant mice (18Ma S. Charron J. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6936-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Only growth retardation of embryo and slight delay of skeletal development of late gestation were reported as well as a delayed entry to S phase. Such mild phenotypes indicate that members of Plks may mutually compensate their function. Although it has not been clear how much hVPS18 contributes to the physiological protein level of SNK in vivo, the cell-cycle progression is similar between SNK-/- cells and HeLa cells overexpressing hVPS18. We assume that hVPS18 is involved in the degradation of SNK, at least in HeLa cells. In some cases, hVPS18 may not be the only E3 involved in SNK ubiquitylation, because the knock-down of hVPS18 did not completely abolish the ubiquitylation and degradation of SNK in vivo (data not shown). Several different classes of E3 ubiquitin ligases appear to directly regulate the same substrate in the case of p53, Numb, and Notch receptor (31Nie J. McGill M.A. Dermer M. Dho S.E. Wolting C.D.

For the ubiquitylation of Notch receptor, HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligase Suppressor of Deltex negatively regulates Notch through ubiquitylation (33Cornell M. Evans D.A. Mann R. Fostier M. Flasza M. Monthatong M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Baron M. Genetics. 1999; 152: 567-576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Meanwhile, its related Itch has been shown to ubiquitylate Notch 1 in vivo and in vitro (34Qiu L. Joazeiro C. Fang N. Wang H.Y. Elly C. Altman Y. Fang D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35734-35737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence suggest that the other pathway(s) for ubiquitylation of SNK may exist. Further analyses will be required to reveal the molecular mechanisms in detail. Recently, Pak and Sheng (35Pak D.T. Yang S. Rudolph-Correia S. Kim E. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 289-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) used the yeast-two hybrid screen to identify SNK as a new binding molecule for SPAR (spine-associated Rap guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating protein) that belongs to a growing list of post-synaptic proteins. The overexpression of SNK causes a depletion of SPAR and a loss of mature spines in hippocampal neurons. Biochemical analyses have shown that the neuronal activity induces the expression of SNK and that SNK phosphorylates SPAR (5Pak D.T. Sheng M. Science. 2003; 302: 1368-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Together with our findings, the intracellular level of SNK protein plays a pivotal role not only in the regulation of cell-cycle progression, but also in the brain-specific functions such as learning and memory formation. Additional studies will be required to define further the precise mechanisms that control the protein level of SNK. We greatly appreciate the help and support of Drs. Satoru Masuda, Keiji Wada, Eiki Kominami, Keiji Tanaka, and Yoshihisa Kudo. We thank members of the Dept. of Neurochemistry, NCNP, for discussion."

The DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) is composed of the 40-kDa CAD (DFF40) in complex with its cognate 45-kDa inhibitor (inhibitor of CAD: ICAD or DFF45). The association of ICAD with CAD not only inhibits the DNase activity but is also essential for the co-translational folding of CAD. Activation of CAD requires caspase-3-dependent proteolysis of ICAD. The tertiary structures of neither the inactive nor the activated DFF have been conclusively established. Whereas the inactive DFF is thought to consist of the CAD/ICAD heterodimer, activated CAD has been isolated as a large (>MDa) multimer, as well as a monomer. To establish the subunit stoichiometry of DFF and some of its structural determinants in normal and apoptotic cells, we utilized size-exclusion chromatography in combination with co-immunoprecipitation and mutagenesis techniques. Both endogenous and heterologously expressed DFF have an apparent molecular mass of 160-190 kDa and contain 2 CAD and 2 ICAD molecules (CAD/ICAD)2 in HeLa cells. Although the N-terminal (CIDE-N) domain of CAD is not required for ICAD binding, it is necessary but not sufficient for ICAD homodimerization in the DFF. In contrast, the CIDE-N domain of ICAD is required for CAD/ICAD association. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), dimerization of ICAD in DFF was confirmed in live cells. In apoptotic cells, endogenous and exogenous CAD forms limited oligomers, representing the active nuclease.

A model is proposed for the rearrangement of the DFF subunit stoichiometry in cells undergoing programmed cell death. Apoptosis or programmed cell death ensures the elimination of unwanted cells during normal development and tissue homeostasis without affecting the viability of adjacent cells. At the molecular level, apoptosis comprises a cascade of proteolytic events mediated by a family of cysteine-aspartate proteases, the caspases, involved in both the signaling and the execution phase of cell death (1Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells undergo preprogrammed morphological changes, reflected by cell and nuclear shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and apoptotic body formation, ultimately engulfed by scavenger cells (2Hanayama R. Tanaka M. Miwa K. Shinohara A. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 2002; 417: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). One of the biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis is the cleavage of nuclear DNA into oligonucleosome-sized fragments, or DNA fragmentation, a mechanism thought to be essential for preventing autoimmune diseases and horizontal gene transfer (3Zhang J. Xu M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 84-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 4Herrmann M. Voll R. Zoller O. Hagenhofer M. Ponner B. Kalden J. Arthr.

Although, several nucleases (e.g. endonuclease G, AIF, DNase I, and DNase II) have been implicated in the degradation of genomic DNA during apoptosis (5Scovassi A. Torriglia A. Eur. J. Histochem. 2003; 47: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the 40-kDa caspase-activated DNase (CAD) 2The abbreviations used are: CADcaspase-activated DNaseBRETbioluminescence resonance energy transferBRET2a modified version of BRETCIDEcell-inducing DFF45-like effectorDFFDNA fragmentation factorICADinhibitor of caspase-activated DNasePBSphosphate-buffered salineFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateHAhemagglutininAbantibody. or DNA fragmentation factor 40 (DFF40) is considered to account for the majority of nuclease activity responsible for chromosomal DNA fragmentation (6Nagata S.

In proliferating cells, CAD is expressed as an inactive nuclease by binding to the 45-kDa inhibitor of CAD (ICAD or DFF45), forming the heterodimeric DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) (8Liu X. Zou H.

Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar) but more recent evidence indicates that DFF is constitutively targeted into the nucleus. Two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) at the C termini of CAD and ICAD co-operate for the nuclear uptake of the DFF (15Lechardeur D. Drzymala L. Sharma M. Pacia J. Hicks C. Usmani N. Zylka D.

A 35-kDa splicing variant of ICAD (ICAD-S or DFF35), lacking the C-terminal domain is also ubiquitously expressed, but does not appear to interact with CAD (16Samejima K. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, caspase-3 and -7-mediated cleavage of ICAD provokes the release and activation of CAD, leading to the generation of double-stranded breaks in internucleosomal chromatin regions (18Widlak P.

Several pieces of evidence support the role of protein-protein interactions in the regulation of CAD activity at the co-translational and post-translational levels (3Zhang J. Xu M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 84-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). ICAD appears to be essential for the co-translational folding of CAD in concert with Hsp/Hsc70 and Hsp40 (19Sakahira H. Nagata S. J. Biol.

Biosynthesis of CAD in the absence of ICAD fails to produce folded CAD in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems (20Sakahira H. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8091-8096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, complex formation of CAD with ICAD inhibits the nuclease activity providing a safeguard mechanism against inadvertent activation of the DNase (10Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K.

A variety of DNA-binding proteins, such as histone H1, high mobility group (HMG) 1/2, and topoisomerase II have been invoked in the stimulation of CAD in vitro, as allosteric activators and/or by influencing the DNA conformation (9Liu X.

Both CAD and ICAD are composed of an N-terminal regulatory domain homologous to the N terminus of the pro-apoptotic CIDE (cell-inducing DFF45-like effector) A/B proteins (24Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Benedict M.A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 270-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The CIDE-N domains of CAD and ICAD have been shown to mediate their heterodimerization in DFF (24Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Benedict M.A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 270-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The oligomerization tendency of the CIDE-N domain also provided a plausible explanation for the observation that the CAD/ICAD complex is expressed as a heterodimer (apparent molecular mass 85 kDa) (8Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 13Liu X. Zou H. Widlack P. Garrard W. Wang X. J. Biol.

The quaternary structure of activated DFF is less well established. Following the caspase-3-dependent proteolysis of ICAD, CAD was identified in large homo-oligomers (>1 MDa), constituting the active form of the DNase (13Liu X. Zou H. Widlack P. Garrard W. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13836-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Meiss G. Scholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Pingoud A.

Whereas the activated CAD, purified from lymph node cells, was monomeric (10Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar), recombinant DFF showed multimodal size distribution with the prevalence of large oligomers (21Widlak P. Lanuszewska J. Cary R.B. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26915-26922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Large homo-oligomers as representative of activated endogenous CAD were detected by native pore-exclusion limit electrophoresis as well (21Widlak P. Lanuszewska J. Cary R.B. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26915-26922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 27Widlak P. Garrard W.T. J. Cell Biochem. 2005; 94: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Notably, the crystal structure of CAD suggested a homodimeric configuration in the form of molecular scissors of DNA (28Woo E.-J. Kim Y.-G. Kim M.-S. Han W. Shin S. Robinson H. Park S.-Y. Oh B.-H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To assess the composition of endogenous and exogenous DFF in normal and apoptotic cells, we used complementary in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our results, obtained by size-exclusion chromatography, co-immunoprecipitation, and the bioluminescence fluorescence energy transfer (BRET) technique suggest that the inactive DFF contains two ICAD and two CAD molecules. Whereas the CIDE-N domain of CAD is necessary but not sufficient for CAD-dependent homodimerization of ICAD in the inactive DFF, it is not required for ICAD/CAD dimerization. Following the proteolysis of ICAD in vivo, the molecular mass of both endogenous and heterologously expressed CAD is consistent with the formation of dimeric/tetrameric CAD. We propose that conversion of the heterotetrameric DFF into homo-oligomeric CAD contributes to the activation mechanism of DFF in apoptotic cells. Plasmid Construction—The cDNA, encoding the human and mouse CADs (hCAD and mCAD) were kindly provided by Dr. R. Halenbeck (Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA) and Dr. S. Nagata (Department of Genetics, Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan), respectively. The cDNA of human ICAD was isolated by PCR cloning using a cDNa library prepared from CaCo-2 cells (American Type Culture Collection, HTB37) as a template (15Lechardeur D. Drzymala L. Sharma M. Pacia J. Hicks C. Usmani N. Zylka D. Rommens J. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged CADs and ICADs were obtained as described previously (15Lechardeur D. Drzymala L. Sharma M. Pacia J. Hicks C. Usmani N. Zylka D. Rommens J. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, hICAD, mCAD, and hCAD were subcloned into the expression plasmid vector pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1, incorporating in-frame fusion of the coding sequence of the HA, Myc, or the FLAG epitope at either the C or the N terminus. ΔCIDE deletion mutants of mCAD and hICAD were obtained by PCR, amplifying the cDNA fragments encoding amino acid residues 84-344 in mCAD and 83-331 in hICAD. The cDNA fragments were inserted into pcDNA3.1 harboring a Myc tag at the C terminus. hICAD-S expression vector was constructed by PCR and encoded amino acid residues 1-266 of hICAD. The expression plasmid encoding the HA-CAD-EGFP fusion protein (CAD-GFP) was constructed by subcloning the coding region of the HA-CAD into pEGFP-N1 plasmid (BD Biosciences). N- and C-terminal truncations of hCAD were obtained by PCR, and the mutants were subcloned into pEGFP-N1 plasmid as described (29Lechardeur D. Xu M. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ICAD-Rluc expression vector was obtained by inserting hICAD lacking its stop codon into the pRluc-N1 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). GFP2, the F64L mutant of GFP, was cut out from the pRluc-GFP2 vector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and fused to the C terminus of the hICAD. All constructs were verified by dideoxy chain termination DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Induction of Apoptosis—HeLa and COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2 containing air. Transfections were performed with FuGENE (Roche Applied Science), and cells were harvested after 24-48 h. The ratio of CAD/ICAD plasmid DNA was 1:1 or 2:1 in transient transfections. To maintain the DNA/lipid ratio and comparable transfection efficiency, identical levels of the total amount of DNA (8 μg of DNA/24 μl of FuGENE for 10 cm, 60% confluent tissue culture dish) was utilized in different transfections by supplementing the indicated expression vectors with the appropriate amount of pcDNA3.1. Apoptosis was induced with 2 μm staurosporine (Sigma) for 2 h in tissue culture medium. S-100 Fractions of HeLa Cells and Caspase-3-induced Activation of CAD—Transiently transfected HeLa cells were resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 15 min of incubation on ice, cells were disrupted by 15 strokes in a 2-ml Kontes homogenizer (B pestle, Kontes Glass). The lysates were cleared (15,000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C), and insoluble materials were sedimented in a bench-top Beckman ultracentrifuge (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Aliquots of the S-100 fraction were incubated for 1 h at 21 °C with recombinant human caspase-3 (Calbiochem) at the indicated concentration. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitations were performed on cells transiently transfected with the indicated CAD and ICAD constructs. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, detached from culture dishes with a non-enzymatic cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), and sedimented by centrifugation (2000 × g, 5 min at 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended and incubated in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C), and soluble proteins were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer (LSB) or immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using the indicated antibodies (see below) and protein G-agarose (Sigma). Proteins were eluted from the beads with 2× LSB containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-HA.11 (Covance), mouse monoclonal anti-Myc 9E10 (Covance), mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (Molecular Probes), monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-mCAD (AAP-351, Stressgen), rabbit polyclonal anti-human CAD (BD Pharmingen), and monoclonal anti-Hsc/HSP70 (Calbiochem). The rabbit polyclonal anti-hICAD was prepared and characterized as described (15Lechardeur D. Drzymala L. Sharma M. Pacia J. Hicks C. Usmani N. Zylka D. Rommens J. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs (Amersham Biosciences) and Supersignal West Pico Stable peroxide solution (Pierce). Immunostaining—Transfected HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3), and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked in 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with the rat monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-Myc (Santa Cruz), and the M2 mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibodies, in blocking solution. Primary antibodies were visualized with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat (Jackson), TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson), and Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen). Triple-stained cells were analyzed with a Zeiss 510 fluorescence laser confocal microscope. Single optical sections were taken consecutively, using the 488-, 543-, and 633-nm laser lines. Control experiments verified that no fluorescence spill-over occurred in any of the cells stained with a single-fluorophore (data not shown). Images were assembled with Adobe Photoshop 7 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Gel Filtration Chromatography—HeLa cells were solubilized as described for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Lysates were cleared by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) in a bench-top Beckman ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was loaded on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 15% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4 and mounted on a Beckman Gold Nouveau HPLC system (166 pump module, 168 detector). Fractions of 300 μl were collected on ice at a flow rate of 0.2-0.3 ml/min. The following molecular size markers were used to calibrate the gel filtration column after each separation: carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; alcohol dehydrogenase, 150 kDa; β-amylase, 200 kDa; apoferritin, 443 kDa; thyroglobulin, 669 kDa, and blue dextran, 2 MDa (molecular weight marker kit, Sigma). 80 μl from each fraction were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis as described in the figure legend. BRET2 Measurement—Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer between ICAD-GFP2 and ICAD-Rluc fusion proteins was analyzed on transiently transfected COS-7 cells essentially as described (31Perroy J. Pontier S. Charest P.G. Aubry M. Bouvier M. Nature Met. 2004; 1: 203-208Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cells were detached from the culture dishes and suspended in PBS containing 0.1% glucose before addition of the Rluc substrate DeepBlue Colenterazine (DeepBlueC, Packard Biosciences) in 96-well plates (Costar). BRET was monitored by a Polarstar Ultima (BMG Labtech) luminometer. The BRET signal was determined by calculating the ratio of the light emitted by the ICAD-GFP2 (500-530 nm) and the light emitted by the ICAD-Rluc (370-450 nm). The values were corrected by subtracting the background signal of non-transfected cells. In each experiment nonspecific BRET2 signal of ICAD-GFP co-expressed with Rluc and Rluc alone was also determined. Contribution of CAD and ICAD to the Formation of DFF in Vivo—To test whether DFF is a heterodimer in vivo, as proposed previously (13Liu X. Zou H. Widlack P. Garrard W. Wang X. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar) the molecular mass of DFF components was determined by size-exclusion chromatography. Triton X-100 (0.2%) not only fully extracted the cellular DFF content, but also preserved the association of CAD and ICAD, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies (data not shown and Ref. 15Lechardeur D. Drzymala L. Sharma M. Pacia J. Hicks C. Usmani N. Zylka D. Rommens J. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In HeLa cell lysates, endogenous CAD was detected as a single polypeptide band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼40 kDa by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A, lys). The polyclonal anti-ICAD Ab recognized both the full-length form (ICAD, ∼45 kDa) and its spliced variant, ICAD-S (∼35 kDa, Fig. 1A, lys and Ref. 15Lechardeur D. Drzymala L. Sharma M. Pacia J. Hicks C. Usmani N. Zylka D. Rommens J. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of size-fractionated cell extracts revealed that endogenous CAD was associated with a macromolecular complex of ∼150-190 kDa (Fig. 1A, top panel), which was significantly larger than the predicted molecular mass of the CAD/ICAD heterodimer (∼72 kDa). Regarding the ICAD elution pattern, two distinct populations could be distinguished. A significant amount of ICAD was co-fractionated with CAD between ∼150 and ∼190 kDa (Fig. 1A, lower panel), conceivably because of their complex formation. Immunoreactive CAD, however, was absent from the second population of ICAD, confined between ∼45 and ∼90 kDa (Fig. 1A). This could be explained by the biosynthesis of molar excess of ICAD, unable to bind CAD (Fig. 1A). Virtually all the endogenous ICAD-S was fractionated in the absence of CAD with an apparent molecular mass of <70 kDa, consistent with its negligible binding to CAD in the presence of excess ICAD (Fig. 1 and Ref. 17Sholz S.R. Korn C. Gimadutdinow O. Knoblauch M. Pingoud A. Meiss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when the chromatography was performed on HeLa S-100 fraction (data not shown). The Endogenous and Exogenous DFF Has Similar Molecular Mass—The molecular mass of the endogenous DFF (∼150-190 kDa) is consistent with the possibility that DFF is composed of more than a single CAD/ICAD heterodimer in dividing cells. This hypothesis is at variance with previous propositions indicating that DFF is a heterodimer (∼80 kDa) (13Liu X. Zou H. Widlack P. Garrard W. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13836-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 10Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). In an attempt to establish the subunit composition of the DFF, we utilized a panel of epitope-tagged (HA, Myc, and FLAG) CAD and ICAD molecules. As a convention, the N-terminal tag precedes (e.g. HA-CAD), whereas the C-terminal tag follows (e.g. CAD-HA) the name of the polypeptide. We have established that ∼5-fold overexpression of CAD and ICAD relative to their endogenous level was sufficient to ensure preferential incorporation of tagged molecules into the heterologous DFF (29Lechardeur D. Xu M. Lukacs G.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Control experiments demonstrated that the tagged CAD and ICAD reproduced the cellular phenotype (constitutive nuclear targeting) and biochemical properties (chaperone function of ICAD, complex formation between ICAD and CAD, and immobilization of activated CAD to the nuclear matrix) of their endogenous counterparts (Refs. 15Lechardeur D.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and data not shown). To validate that the complex formation of epitope-tagged CAD and ICAD was preserved, extracts of HeLa cells, transiently co-expressing CAD-HA and ICAD-Myc, were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography. The elution profiles of CAD-HA (Fig. 1B, upper panel) and ICAD-Myc (Fig. 1B, lower panel) were visualized with the anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies, respectively. CAD-HA was eluted as a single, ∼150-200-kDa peak, similar to that of the endogenous CAD (Fig. 1A). ICAD-Myc resided in the same fractions as CAD-HA (Fig. 1B, lower panel), consistent with their association. A fraction of ICAD-Myc was eluted at ∼70-100 kDa, likely representing uncomplexed protein, similar to that observed for the endogenous mammalian ICAD as well as Drosophila dICAD (21Widlak P. Lanuszewska J. Cary R.B. Garrard W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26915-26922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Mukae N. Enari M. Sakahira H. Fukuda Y. Inazawa J. Toh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9123-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The observation that the endogenous and exogenous CADs have similar chromatographic profiles confirmed that epitope-tagged CAD and ICAD preserved their oligomerization propensity and were suitable for investigating the subunit stoichiometry of DFF. These data also imply that the DFF either incorporates more than one CAD/ICAD heterodimer, or associates with other polypeptides in vivo. Two ICAD Molecules Are Incorporated into the DFF—If DFF consists of two CAD/ICAD heterodimers in non-apoptotic cells, co-expression of ICAD-Myc and HA-ICAD should be observed in ∼50% of the exogenous DFF complexes. To test this prediction, it was necessary to transiently co-express ICAD-Myc and HA-ICAD (or ICAD-Myc and FLAG-ICAD) in the presence of FLAG-CAD (or CAD-HA) and to evaluate their oligomerization with the co-immunoprecipitation technique. To this end, we demonstrated first that co-expression of CAD and ICAD molecules with three different epitope tags did not interfere with their nuclear targeting by immunostaining (Fig. 2A). Most of the cells contained the three constructs, suggesting that they"

Although the head group structure of acyl chain-labeled NBD phospholipids has been shown to influence the mechanism of flip across the plasma membrane, the extent to which the acyl chain region and the associated fluorophore affect flip has not been assessed. Given the identification of these proteins required for NBD-PC flip, it is now possible to determine whether the fluorophore attached to a phospholipid acyl chain influences the mechanism of flip. Thus, flip of phosphatidylcholine molecules with three different Bodipy fluorophores (Bodipy FL, Bodipy 530, and Bodipy 581) was tested and compared with that of NBD-PC in strains carrying deletions in LEM3, DNF1, and DNF2. Deletion of these genes significantly reduced the flip of NBD-PC and Bodipy FL-PC but had no effect on that of Bodipy 581-PC and Bodipy 530-PC. These data, in combination with comparisons of the effect of ATP depletion, collapse of the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane, and culture density led to the conclusion that at least three different flip pathways exist in yeast that are selective for the structure of the fluorophore attached to the acyl chain of phosphatidylcholine molecules.

Fluorescent acyl chain-labeled phospholipids have been used extensively as reporters to study the transport and intracellular trafficking of phospholipids in a wide range of cells (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Nichols J.W.

Attachment of the fluorophore to the terminal end of one acyl chain permits the synthesis of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids with a wide range of different head groups. The fluorophore is generally attached to a shortened acyl chain in the sn-2 position to facilitate the introduction of these reporter phospholipids into the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This approach has demonstrated that the nature of the head group is a major determinant of the pathway of internalization and subsequent intracellular trafficking and localization of these reporter phospholipids (4Pagano R.E. Sleight R.G. Science. 1985; 229: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Application of genetic and genomic approaches available for Saccharomyces cerevisiae has led to the identification of three gene products that are required for the normal uptake of a phosphatidylcholine reporter labeled in the sn-2 acyl chain with NBD 4The abbreviations used are: NBD7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-ylNBD-PC1-myristoyl-2-[6-(NBD) aminocaproyl]-phosphatidylcholineBodipy FL-PC2-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineBodipy 530-PC2-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-diphenyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineBodipy 581-PC2-(4,4-difluoro-5-(4-phenyl-1,3-butadienyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineCCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazoneSDCsynthetic complete medium: 0.67% yeast nitrogen base; 2% glucose; complete amino acid supplementsSC-NaN3SDC lacking glucose but containing 2% sorbitol and 20 mM NaN3.

A similar inhibition of NBD-PC internalization is observed in strains deleted in both DNF1 and DNF2 (7Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. Van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Dnf1p and Dnf2p are members of the P-type ATPase family that couple ATP hydrolysis to the transmembrane transport of a wide spectrum of ions. They belong to a subfamily of P-type ATPases that has been reported to actively transport phospholipids (8Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P.

Lem3p encodes an integral membrane protein that is necessary for exit of Dnf1p from the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a role as a chaperone but not ruling out a role as a subunit of a functional transporter complex at the plasma membrane (10Saito K.

The identification of three proteins that define an internalization pathway for NBD-PC provides the opportunity for the first time to determine whether the structure of the fluorescent reporter group in the acyl chain region affects the mechanism of internalization. With this goal in mind, the plasma membrane flip of NBD-PC was compared with that of phosphatidylcholine molecules differing only in the structure of the Bodipy probe attached to the sn-2 acyl chain in strains deleted for LEM3, DNF1, and DNF2. The results indicated that, dependent on the structure of the fluorescent probe in the acyl chain, phosphatidylcholine molecules were flipped across the plasma membrane by at least two different mechanisms. NBD-PC flip across the plasma membrane is also inhibited by ATP depletion, nutrient depletion, and collapse of the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Comparison of the plasma membrane flip of the four phosphatidylcholine reporter molecules in response to these perturbations led to the identification of a third flip mechanism dependent on the fluorophore structure. Thus, at least three different mechanisms for phosphatidylcholine flip across the plasma membrane of yeast can be distinguished by altering the structure of the fluorescent moiety in the acyl chain region. Materials—Yeast medium was obtained from Difco. All other reagents, unless otherwise noted, were purchased from Sigma. NBD-PC was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. All other lipids, including Bodipy FL-PC, Bodipy 530-PC, and Bodipy 581-PC, were purchased from Molecular Probes. Stocks of the four fluorescent phospholipids (5 mm) were prepared by solubilization of the dried phospholipids in dimethyl sulfoxide. Phospholipids were stored at -20 °C and periodically monitored for purity by thin-layer chromatography. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by absorbance in methanol at 466 nm for NBD-PC (ϵ = 22,000), 503 nm for Bodipy FL-PC (ϵ = 80,000), 534 nm for Bodipy 530-PC (ϵ = 64,000), and 582 nm for Bodipy 581-PC (ϵ = 124,000). Extinction coefficients were provided by Molecular Probes. Yeast Strains and Culture—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are shown in TABLE ONE.

Open table in a new tab Internalization of Phospholipids into Yeast—For analysis of wild-type and deletion strains at physiological temperature, overnight cultures were diluted to 0.1 A600 and grown for several hours to early log phase (A600 0.2-0.4) in SDC at 30 °C. Dimethyl sulfoxide-solubilized lipid was added to a final concentration of 5 μm and vortex mixed. After a 30-min incubation with the phospholipid at 30 °C or a 1-h incubation with the phospholipid at 2 °C, cells were harvested and washed three times with ice-cold SC-NaN3. Cells were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy and/or flow cytometry. For analysis of ATP-depleted parent strains, cultures were grown as described above. Immediately prior to labeling, cells were harvested, resuspended in SC-NaN3, and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Labeling was then performed at 2 °C as described above. Collapse of the plasma membrane proton electrochemical gradient was accomplished by incubation of the cells in 0, 1, 5, 20, or 50 μm CCCP in SDC for 10 min at 30 °C preceding labeling at 2 °C. After labeling with the fluorescent phospholipids, washed cells were incubated for 15 min with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2 phenylindole to label mitochondrial and nuclear DNA prior to imaging by fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of lipid remaining intact after internalization was determined for each strain and each fluorescent phospholipid used in this study via analysis of TLC-separated cell extracts following labeling. Quantification of fluorescent products present in the extracts revealed greater than 80% of fluorescence was from intact lipid for all fluorescent-labeled phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in all strains. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometric analysis of the phospholipid-labeled cells was performed with a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). For all analyses, 10 μl of a 75-μm stock solution of propidium iodide was added to ∼4 × 105 cells in 1 ml of SC-NaN3 immediately prior to dilution (∼3-fold) and flow cytometric analysis on a cytometer equipped with an argon laser operating at 488 nm. Ten thousand cells were analyzed without gating during the acquisition. Analysis was performed with CellQuest (BD Biosciences) software. A dot plot of forward scatter versus the red fluorescence channel (propidium iodide) was used to set a gate that excluded dead cells from the analysis. The percentage of excluded dead cells was <5% during analysis of untreated mutant and parent strains. This percentage increased to a maximum of 15% in those experiments involving ATP depletion, CCCP treatment, and high density. Channels for analysis of each fluorophore-conjugated lipid were chosen based on the maximum wavelengths of emission for each fluorophore. Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope equipped with barrier filters allowing for detection of each probe. Filter sets were obtained from Chroma Technology Corp. A multiband dichroic mirror (86000 BS) was used with the filter combinations exciter S490/20 and emitter S528/38 for NBD and Bodipy FL and exciter S555/28 and emitter S617/73 for Bodipy 530 and Bodipy 581. The fluorescence images were captured with a Qimaging Retiga Exi CCD camera and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). The mean pixel intensity for each cell region was calculated and corrected for background fluorescence of a region containing no cells. Data from each independent experiment represent the average pixel intensity of no less than 30 cells. Although analysis by flow cytometry is quantitatively more accurate, microscopic pixel analysis was necessary to quantify the internalization of Bodipy 581-PC because of the lack of a suitable laser for its excitation. The remaining three fluorescent PC molecules were analyzed by both methods to demonstrate the degree of reproducibility between the methods. In all cases, the qualitative differences in cell-associated fluorescence observed between strains and treatment conditions were maintained. The Bodipy and NBD Phosphatidylcholine Analogs Are Distributed to Different Intracellular Organelles—In previous work, we demonstrated that at 30 °C NBD-PC is internalized primarily by flip and trafficked to the lumen of the vacuole via the prevacuolar compartment (12Hanson P.K. Grant A.M. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2725-2733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) where it is degraded by vacuolar hydrolases (13Kean L.S. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphatidylcholine molecules with different fluorophores attached to the acyl chain were trafficked to the vacuole in a similar manner, we labeled cells at 30 °C with three different Bodipy fluorophores (Bodipy 581-PC, Bodipy FL-PC, and Bodipy 530-PC; see Fig. 1 for structures) and observed their distribution within the cells by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2). NBD-PC was the only fluorescent-tagged phosphatidylcholine molecule that was trafficked to the vacuole. Bodipy 581-PC localized primarily to the mitochondria, as shown by co-localization with the 4′,6-diamidino-2 phenylindole staining of mitochondrial DNA. Bodipy FL-PC- and Bodipy 530-PC-labeled membranes surrounding 4′,6-diamidino-2 phenylindole stained nuclear DNA, indicative of nuclear/endoplasmic reticulum membranes, as well as additional unidentified membranous organelles. The various distribution patterns observed for the Bodipy-labeled phosphatidylcholine reporter molecules are unlikely to be caused by differences in degradation because >85% remained intact as determined by quantification of TLC-separated cell extracts following labeling (data not shown).FIGURE 2Fluorescently labeled phosphatidylcholine analogs localize to different intracellular regions at 30 °C.

Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed for the three Bodipy-labeled phosphatidylcholine analogs. Deletion of END4 had little or no effect on the 30 °C internalization and localization of each of the three Bodipy-labeled phosphatidylcholine molecules (data not shown), indicating that, as with NBD-PC, internalization of the Bodipy-labeled phosphatidylcholine molecules is not dependent on endocytosis and thus is internalized primarily by flip across the plasma membrane. These data indicate that all four of the phosphatidylcholine reporter molecules are internalized predominantly by flip across the plasma membrane and that the structure of the fluorescence moiety attached to the acyl chain is sufficient to alter their partitioning and/or trafficking from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to the other membranous organelles of the cell. The work reported below will focus on the mechanism of flip and address specifically whether the Bodipy-labeled phosphatidylcholine molecules are flipped by the same mechanism as identified previously for NBD-PC. The molecular details underlying the observed differential localization patterns for the fluorescent reporter molecules will be addressed in future investigations. LEM3 Is Required for Flip of NBD-PC and Bodipy FL-PC, but Not for Bodipy 581-PC and Bodipy 530-PC—In our previous work, we demonstrated that the net accumulation of NBD-PC in cells labeled at 30 °C is determined by the rates of both inward-directed (flip) and outward-directed (flop) transport across the plasma membrane (15Kean L.S.

To determine the effect of gene deletions on the rate of flip in the absence of flop, the net accumulation of each of the fluorescent phosphatidylcholine molecules was measured at 2 °C (Figs. 3A and 4A, left panels). At this temperature, the rate of flop for NBD-PC (16Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol.

Furthermore, because endocytosis and vesicle budding and fusion are also blocked at 2 °C (14Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W.

Thus, a Δlem3 strain (LMY102) and its isogenic LEM3 parent strain (LMY94) were labeled with each of the fluorescent phosphatidylcholine molecules at 2 °C. Visualization of the fluorescence images and quantification by image analysis and flow cytometry (Fig. 3) confirmed the expected reduction in NBD-PC flip in the Δlem3 strain (6Hanson P.K. Malone L. Birchmore J.L. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36041-36050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Deletion of LEM3 decreased flip of Bodipy FL-PC in a manner similar to NBD-PC, whereas flip of Bodipy 581-PC and Bodipy 530-PC was actually slightly increased. These data indicate that Bodipy 581-PC and Bodipy 530-PC are internalized by a flip mechanism that is independent of the expression of the Lem3 protein. Because each of these fluorescent phospholipids has the identical glycerophosphorylcholine backbone and head group, these data demonstrate that the selectivity for the flip mechanism is determined by the structure of the acyl chain and the attached fluorophore in addition to that of the head group. DNF1 and DNF2 Are Required for Flip of NBD-PC, but Not Bodipy 581-PC or Bodipy 530-PC—Because deletion of DNF1 and DNF2, alone and in combination, has been shown to reduce the low temperature flip of NBD-PC (7Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. Van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether flip of the three Bodipy-labeled phosphatidylcholine molecules was similarly dependent on their expression. We measured the low temperature flip of the four fluorescent phosphatidylcholine reporters in strains deleted in DNF1 (LMY165), DNF2 (LMY166), and the two combined (LMY167). As expected from the results of Pomorski et al. (7Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. Van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), flip of NBD-PC was slightly reduced, if at all, in the Δdnf1 strain, reduced ∼50% in the Δdnf2 strain, and reduced >80% in the double deletion Δdnf1Δdnf2 strain (Fig. 4). On the other hand, flip of Bodipy 530-PC is slightly inhibited in both Δdnf1 and Δdnf2 single deletion strains but significantly increased in the double deletion Δdnf1Δdnf2 strain. A similar increase in Bodipy 581-PC flip was observed in the Δdnf1Δdnf2 strain, although little or no difference was observed between the parent and single deletion strains. These data indicate that contrary to flip of NBD-PC, flip of Bodipy 530-PC and Bodipy 581-PC does not require the expression of Dnf1p and Dnf2p. In fact, it is actually increased in their absence. This finding suggests that the deletion of DNF1 and DNF2 results in the up-regulation of an alternative mechanism(s) that is/are responsible for flip of Bodipy 581-PC and Bodipy 530-PC. Quantitative data in Fig. 4, B and C, indicate that the amount of Bodipy FL-PC taken into the cell is only slightly reduced in the Δdnf1Δdnf2 strain. However, microscopic images shown in Fig. 4A illustrate that the cell-associated fluorescence is accumulated at the plasma membrane as opposed to internal membranes seen in the parent and single deletion mutant strains. Based on the observed partial inhibition of Bodipy FL-PC flip in both of the single dnf null mutants, the appearance of plasma membrane labeling in the Δdnf1Δdnf2 strain suggests a complete block of flip resulting in accumulation in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that in the double deletion strain, the Bodipy FL-PC is flipped to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane but its transfer to internal membranes is blocked. Further experiments will be required to distinguish between these two possibilities. Fluorescently Labeled Phosphatidylcholine Analogs Differ in Their Response to ATP Depletion—Depletion of cellular ATP stores has been shown previously to inhibit the low temperature flip of NBD-PC by >80% (14Grant A.M. Hanson P.K. Malone L. Nichols J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In an effort to characterize further the putative alternative flip pathways identified for the Bodipy-labeled phosphatidylcholine analogs, we tested the effect of ATP depletion on their low temperature flip. Cells were labeled with each of the fluorescent phosphatidylcholine analogs following ATP depletion by incubation in glucose-deficient medium containing 10 mm NaN3 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). This treatment reduces ATP levels by 80% (13Kean L.S. Fuller R.S. Nichols J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Both the fluorescent images and quantitative data concur that ATP depletion substantially reduces the rate of NBD-PC and Bodipy FL-PC flip to <40% of normal (Fig. 5). The low temperature flip of Bodipy 581-PC is slightly inhibited by ATP depletion, whereas that of Bodipy 530-PC is surprisingly increased. The increase in low temperature flip of Bodipy 530-PC following ATP depletion suggests yet a third mechanism of transport that is specific for Bodipy 530-PC relative to the other phosphatidylcholine analogs and is inhibited or down-regulated in the presence of normal levels of ATP. The Plasma Membrane Proton Electrochemical Gradient Is Required for Normal Flip for Each of the Four Phosphatidylcholine Analogs—Incubation of yeast cells with the protonophore CCCP in a concentration sufficient to collapse the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane almost completely blocks the low temperature flip of NBD-PC (16Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because yeasts grown in glucose do not depend on oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP, it is possible to collapse the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane without substantially depleting cellular ATP levels (20Serrano R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). 5H. C. Stevens and J. W. Nichols, unpublished observations. Thus, the proton electrochemical gradient is required for NBD-PC flip even in the presence of ATP. Given this requirement for NBD-PC flip, it was of interest to determine whether the Bodipy-labeled phosphatidylcholine analogs were similarly dependent on the plasma membrane proton electrochemical gradient. The effect of increasing concentrations of CCCP on the low temperature flip of each of the fluorescent phosphatidylcholine analogs was measured (Fig. 6). CCCP treatment reduced flip of all four of the fluorescent phosphatidylcholine analogs without affecting the pattern of intracellular localization (data not shown). NBD-PC and Bodipy 581-PC flip was inhibited by ∼90% at 50 μm CCCP, whereas that of Bodipy FL-PC and Bodipy 530-PC was affected to a lesser extent (40-50%). These data indicate that flip of all four of the fluorescent phosphatidylcholine analogs is at least partially dependent on the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. The partial inhibition observed for Bodipy FL-PC and Bodipy 530-PC suggests an alternative pathway that is independent of the proton electrochemical driving force. Culture Growth Past Early Log Phase Reduces Flip of All Lipids Except Bodipy 581-PC—Flip of NBD-PC is at its most active in early log phase cultures, and the rate steadily declines as the culture density increases and the culture medium is depleted of nutrients (16Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine whether low temperature flips of the Bodipy-labeled phosphatidylcholine analogs were affected similarly, we measured their flip in cells at various times following inoculation into fresh SDC medium (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Plots of low temperature flip versus growth phase represented by A600 of the cultures (Fig. 7) revealed three different patterns of regulation depending on the structure of the fluorophore. Flip of NBD-PC and Bodipy FL-PC declined steadily with increasing culture density, whereas Bodipy 581-PC flip was independent of culture density over the range studied. Flip of Bodipy 530-PC, however, exhibited a biphasic response. Its flip was initially reduced, followed by a recovery to maximum rates at higher culture density. These data provide additional support for the identification of three different mechanisms for low temperature flip depending on the structure of the fluorescent moiety in the acyl chain of phosphatidylcholine molecules. The steady decrease in the rate of flip as a function of culture density observed for NBD-PC and Bodipy FL-PC reflects the regulation of at least one pathway. The lack of regulation in response to culture density observed for Bodipy 581-PC reflects a second pathway. The biphasic regulation observed for Bodipy 530-PC reflects a third. Data presented here provide the first demonstration that the acyl chain moiety of fluorescent phosphatidylcholine analogs can determine the pathway by which a phospholipid molecule is transported in the cell. We have shown that at the physiological temperature of 30 °C only NBD-PC is transported to the vacuole for degradation, whereas each of the Bodipy-labeled phosphatidylcholine analogs is internalized to a different combination of intracellular membranes (Fig. 2). The observation that the extent of internalization and intracellular distribution of the four fluorescent phosphatidylcholine analogs is unaffected in strains in which endocytosis is blocked by the deletion of END4 (data not shown) suggests that each of the phosphatidylcholine analogs is internalized by flip across the plasma membrane. These data demonstrate that the structure of the fluorophore attached to the acyl chain of a phosphatidylcholine molecule is sufficient to produce the differential distribution between the intracellular membranes observed for the four labeled phosphatidylcholine molecules. The fluorophore likely alters some combination of the following: the pathway for flip, the pathway for flop, the mechanism of intracellular trafficking, or the spontaneous transport and partitioning between membranes. To focus on the mechanism of flip across the plasma membrane, internalization of the four phosphatidylcholine analogs was studied at 2 °C. At this temperature, not only is endocytosis blocked but efflux (flop) across the plasma membrane is also blocked (see Ref. 16Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar for NBD-PC; data not shown for Bodipy analogs). Thus, the effect of genetic and biochemical perturbations on the mechanism of flip could be studied in isolation. At this temperature, each of the phosphatidylcholine analogs was flipped across the plasma membrane and differentially distributed among the intracellular membranes (Figs. 3A and 4A). The relative effects of each of the experimental parameters on the low temperature flip of the four phosphatidylcholine analogs are summarized in TABLE TWO.TABLE TWOSummary of effectors of fluorescent phosphatidylcholine flipaSize and direction of arrows reflect the relative effect of perturbation on fluorescent-labeled phosphatidylcholine internalization at 2 °C.a Size and direction of arrows reflect the relative effect of perturbation on fluorescent-labeled phosphatidylcholine internalization at 2 °C. Open table in a new tab As shown previously (5Kato U. Emoto K. Fredriksson C. Nakamura H. Ohta A. Kobayashi T. Murakami-Murofushi K. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37855-37862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 6Hanson P.K. Malone L. Birchmore J.L. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36041-36050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), deletion of LEM3 significantly inhibited the low temperature flip of NBD-PC (Fig. 3). Low temperature flip of Bodipy FL-PC was also significantly inhibited, although not to the same extent. Interestingly, flip of the other two Bodipy analogs was actually increased relative to the isogenic parent strain. Thus, Bodipy 530-PC and Bodipy 581-PC are not dependent on the expression of Lem3p to flip across the plasma membrane. In addition, the observed increase in flip in the Δlem3 strain suggests the up-regulation of an alternative flip pathway that selectively transports Bodipy 530-PC and Bodipy 581-PC, but not Bodipy FL-PC or NBD-PC. Comparison of the low temperature flip of the four phosphatidylcholine analogs in strains deleted in both DNF1 and DNF2 provides further support for a second selective flip pathway. Deletion of DNF1 and DNF2 dramatically inhibited the low temperature flip of NBD-PC as shown previously (7Pomorski T. Lombardi R. Riezman H. Devaux P.F. Van Meer G. Holthuis J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, flip of Bodipy 530-PC and Bodipy 581-PC was increased in this strain. As a result of the accumulation of Bodipy FL-PC at the plasma membrane in the Δdnf1Δdnf2 strain, the cell-associated fluorescence measured by flow cytometry and pixel analysis does not appear to be significantly reduced. However, the fluorescence is primarily localized to the plasma membrane, suggesting Bodipy FL-PC flips across the plasma membrane or its subsequent delivery to intracellular membranes is blocked in the absence of Dnf1p and Dnf2p expression. Summarizing the genetic perturbation experiments, the data demonstrated the presence of at least two pathways for low temperature flip that almost exclusively distinguish NBD-PC as substrate from Bodipy 530-PC and Bodipy 581-PC. Bodipy FL-PC appears to be recognized to some extent by both pathways based on the partial inhibition in the Δlem3 strain and the appearance of plasma membrane staining in the Δdnf1Δdnf2 strain. Distinction of a third putative selective flip pathway was identified from the effect of biochemical perturbations on the low temperature flip of the four phosphatidylcholine analogs. Separate mechanisms for the low temperature flip of Bodipy 530-PC and Bodipy 581-PC can be distinguished by the effect of ATP depletion and culture density (Figs. 5 and 7). Depletion of cellular ATP by treatment with NaN3 modestly reduced the low temperature flip of Bodipy 581-PC, whereas that of Bodipy 530-PC actually increased. In addition, flip of Bodipy 581-PC was unaffected by culture density, whereas that of Bodipy 530-PC was regulated in a biphasic pattern, early inhibition followed by a return to starting values. Bodipy FL-PC flip decreased steadily with increasing culture density in a manner observed previously for NBD-PC (16Hanson P.K. Nichols J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9861-9867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Flip of all four phosphatidylcholine analogs was shown to be partially inhibited by collapse of the proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane with CCCP. At the highest concentration of CCCP tested (50 μm), NBD-PC and Bodipy 581-PC were inhibited from 80 to 90% whereas Bodipy FL-PC and Bodipy 530-PC were inhibited 40-50%. The difference in the effect of Bodipy 530-PC and Bodipy 581-PC provides further support for a third flip pathway that distinguishes between these two analogs. The observations presented and discussed above raise several interesting questions worthy of further investigation. Although the data indicate that more than one pathway for flip of phosphatidylcholine analogs exists, the nature of these pathways has yet to be determined. It is possible that the flip pathways that are independent of the expression of LEM3, DNF1, and DNF2 are the result of membrane perturbations, either the loss of transbilayer asymmetry or changes in membrane composition, that allow for the spontaneous, protein-independent movement across the plasma membrane. Although this possibility cannot be ruled out, observations that Bodipy 530-PC and Bodipy 581-PC respond differently to the depletion of cellular ATP and culture density are not easily reconciled with a spontaneous leak pathway. A more likely interpretation is that the flip pathways that are independent of LEM3, DNF1, and DNF2 result from the regulated expression of additional protein-dependent flip mechanisms. In this case, the expected membrane perturbations resulting from the loss of expression of LEM3, DNF1, and DNF2 may be the signal for the increased expression of genes encoding additional flippases with different specificities for the acyl chain region. This type of regulation has already been suggested for Rsb1p, a protein first identified as being involved in the translocation of sphingoid long-chain bases (21Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Rsb1p has also recently been shown to increase flip and decrease flop of NBD-PC and NBD-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine in yeast (21Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, expression of Rsb1p was increased in both Δlem3 and Δdnf1Δdnf2 strains (21Kihara A. Igarashi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that expression of proteins involved in lipid translocation can be altered by the absence of other lipid translocation proteins. Further experimentation is needed to determine whether Rsb1p is acting in a lipid translocation pathway independent of Lem3p and Dnf1p/Dnf2p, as well as whether the Rsb1p pathway contributes to flip of Bodipy 581-PC and/or Bodipy 530-PC. These data raise the question of what structural and/or physical-chemical properties of the phosphatidylcholine analogs determine the different mechanisms of low temperature flip. It is possible that the three different flip mechanisms reflect the presence of three different transporters that recognize the fluorescent groups attached to the phosphatidylcholine molecules. In this case, the transporter would recognize the fluorophore and the remainder of the phospholipid molecule would play a minor role in the recognition and/or transport process. This possibility can be ruled out for NBD- and Bodipy FL-labeled phospholipids and sphingolipids because the head group has been shown to be a major determinant of the mechanism of internalization regardless of the structure of the fluorophore (1Nichols J.W. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 3Marks D.L. Singh R.D. Choudhury A. Wheatley C.L. Pagano R.E. Methods. 2005; 36: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Pagano R.E. Sleight R.G. Science. 1985; 229: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Similar experiments determining the head group dependence of phospholipids labeled in the acyl chain with Bodipy 530 and Bodipy 581 have not been performed, and therefore primary recognition of the structure of Bodipy 530 and Bodipy 581 by different transporters cannot be excluded. However, based on inference from the NBD and Bodipy FL results, it seems more likely that either the recognition by and/or accessibility to the appropriate flippase is determined by the physical-chemical properties of the fluorescent groups (e.g. hydrophobicity and size). Different flippases may be required to transport phosphatidylcholine molecules that differ in the hydrophobicity of the acyl chains. For example, phosphatidylcholine molecules with shorter, more unsaturated acyl chains may be recognized by a different flippase than those with long saturated chains. On the other hand, the physical-chemical properties may determine accessibility to different flippases by favoring partitioning into different microdomains within the plasma membrane. Flippases may differentially partition into these microdomains such that they only flip phosphatidylcholine molecules with access to the same microdomain. For example, if certain fluorescently labeled phosphatidylcholine analogs preferentially partition into the more ordered “lipid raft” type domains, they would have access to lipid transporters present in these domains. In this case, these lipids may be more accurately representing what occurs with endogenous long chain, di-saturated species of phosphatidylcholine. Likewise, fluorescent phosphatidylcholine analogs that partition into the unordered phase would have access to another set of transporters not present in the ordered phase of the membrane. These probes may therefore be representing endogenous species of lipids that are more likely to partition into the unordered phase, such as di-unsaturated species. The differential partitioning of NBD-PC and Bodipy FL-PC has previously been examined and supports the hypothesis that the fluorophore can affect partitioning into membrane phases (22Wang T.Y. Leventis R. Silvius J.R. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 919-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In these experiments it was shown that NBD-PC has a 2-fold higher affinity for vesicles containing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol over vesicles containing sphingomyelin/cholesterol relative to Bodipy FL-PC, although both phospholipids preferred unordered membrane domains. Based on their structures, the differences in relative affinities seen between NBD-PC and Bodipy FL-PC may be even further exaggerated when comparing NBD-PC to the other, more bulky, and hydrophobic Bodipy 530 and Bodipy 581 groups used in this study. Further investigation will be needed to determine whether all the probes used in our study partition differentially into ordered and unordered domains, as well as whether particular proteins involved in lipid translocation are present in these domains. This study demonstrates that the nature of the fluorescent group attached to a phosphatidylcholine molecule has a profound effect on its intracellular trafficking as well as the mechanism by which it is flipped across the plasma membrane. The putative identification of two additional mechanisms for phosphatidylcholine flip that are independent of LEM3, DNF1, and DNF2 expression suggests that the regulation of phospholipid transport and asymmetry is more complex than previously appreciated. These studies provide the basis for the identification of additional flip mechanisms as well as the tools required to uncover the physical-chemical properties of the acyl chain region of phosphatidylcholine species that determine their differential trafficking in cells.

Endoproteolysis is performed by two prohormone convertases, PC1 and PC2. Proteolysis of pro-TRH begins in the trans-Golgi network and forms two intermediates that are then differentially processed as they exit the Golgi and are packaged into immature secretory granules. We hypothesized that this initial endoproteolysis may be necessary for downstream sorting of pro-TRH-derived peptides as it occurs before Golgi exit and thus entry into the regulated secretory pathway. We now report that when pro-TRH is transiently expressed in GH4C1 cells, a neuroendocrine cell line lacking PC1, under pulse-chase conditions release is constitutive and composed of more immature processing intermediates. This is also observed by radioimmunoassay under steady-state conditions. When a mutant form of pro-TRH, which has the dibasic sites of initial processing mutated to glycines, is expressed in AtT20 cells, a neuroendocrine cell line endogenously expressing PC1, both steady-state and pulse-chase experiments revealed that peptides derived from this mutant precursor are secreted in a constitutive fashion. A constitutively secreted form of PC1 does not target pro-TRH peptides to the constitutive secretory pathway but results in sorting to the regulated secretory pathway. These results indicated that initial processing action of PC1 on pro-TRH in the trans-Golgi network, and not a cargo-receptor relationship, is important for the downstream sorting events that result in storage of pro-TRH-derived peptides in mature secretory granules.

For a number of years TRH was the only peptide derived from pro-TRH known to behave as a hormone, but recent work has demonstrated that the other peptides derived from pro-TRH may have physiological function (26Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 599-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Direct physiological evidence of these peptides having functions independent of TRH is currently lacking but is being studied. Processing of pro-TRH by PC1 begins in the TGN generating processing intermediates of pro-TRH prior to packaging into immature secretory granules (27Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.

Because the rat pro-TRH molecule contains several structural elements that have been implicated in the regulated sorting of other prohormone molecules such as dibasic residues (20Feliciangeli S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12461-12467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we have hypothesized that the processing of pro-TRH before packaging into immature secretory granules is critical for its downstream sorting. The early and subsequent PC1 processing events may expose sorting signals, which then become accessible for targeting of the various pro-TRH-derived peptides. To study if pro-TRH sorting to the regulated secretory pathway is affected by PC1 processing, three experimental approaches were utilized: the first one where PC1 itself was either present or absent, the second where the proTRH sequence was mutated to prevent the initial processing by PC1 at the level of the TGN, and third, when pro-TRH was co-expressed with a constitutively secreted PC1 construct (31Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40337-40343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Under both steady-state and pulse-chase conditions in two neuroendocrine cell lines, we found that if PC1 is absent or if PC1 processing is blocked it results in pro-TRH sorting to the constitutive secretory pathway. We conclude that the effect of PC1 on pro-TRH sorting is not because of a cargo-receptor interaction like that observed between brain-derived neurotrophic factor and carboxypeptidase E, (32Lou H. Kim S.K. Zaitsev E. Snell C.R. Lu B. Loh Y.P. Neuron. 2005; 45: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), because the constitutively secreted PC1 acted to increase regulated sorting of pro-TRH as did the wild-type PC1, indicating that processing of pro-TRH itself is important for downstream sorting of pro-TRH. In this study we present the first evidence that PC1 activity greatly enhances the sorting of pro-TRH-derived peptides to the regulated secretory pathway of two neuroendocrine cells lines. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against pro-TRH-derived peptides TRH, pYE26, pAV37, pYE17, and pFE22 were generated by BIOSOURCE and protein G purified before use, except for pFE22 which was affinity-purified before use.

This construct was used for in vitro expression of wild-type prepro-TRH and as a template for creation of the pro-TRH mutant, PC1-Block (Fig. 1). The mutations to pro-TRH were created with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's specifications. Successful mutation and cloning were confirmed by DNA sequencing. AtT20 cells (D16v-F2 subclone; ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with high glucose, 30 mm sodium bicarbonate, 1mm sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine calf serum, and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. GH4C1 cells were grown in the same media as AtT20 cells. GH4C1 cells stably expressing PC1 (GH4C1+PC1) were grown in the same media with 250 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) added to select for cells stably expressing PC1 (35Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Arvan P. Mol.

Plasmid DNA was transiently transfected into AtT20 or GH4C1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagents (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency was evaluated by co-transfection with pEGFP1 (Clontech) and subsequent visualization of green fluorescent protein fluorescence, except when cells were to be used for immunocytochemical experiments. 1 × 107 AtT20 cells were transiently transfected with either wild-type prepro-TRH or PC1-Block. Forty eight hours after transfection, the cells were put under a selection pressure of 250 μg/ml of geneticin (Invitrogen). Clonal populations were then removed from each dish and cultured individually under continual selection pressure. Clones were evaluated for pro-TRH expression, fold stimulation, and by immunocytochemistry to ensure that all cells in each clonal line expressed the transfected constructs.

Open table in a new tab The assays used for pro-TRH-derived peptides were developed in our laboratory by using custom-synthesized or commercially available peptides and primary antibodies (29Gorr S.U. Huang X.F. Cowley D.J. Kuliawat R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C121-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The trace was iodinated using the chloramine T oxidation-reduction method followed by high pressure liquid chromatography purification. The N-terminal antiserum anti-prepro-TRH-(25–50) (pYE26), the C-terminal antiserum anti-prepro-TRH-(240–255) (pYE17), and TRH, which were used to study pro-TRH processing and RIAs, were performed as standard in our laboratory (36Nillni E.A. Friedman T.C. Todd R.B. Birch N.P. Loh Y.P. Jackson I.M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2462-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All RIAs were performed on the same volume of material, in duplicate. The intra- and inter-assay variabilities were 5–6 and 9–12% respectively. Transfected AtT20 or GH4C1 cells were cultured in DMEM labeling media lacking leucine for 20 min to clear cells of endogenous leucine stores. The preclear media were removed and replaced with 5 ml of a mixture containing 90% DMEM labeling media, 10% complete DMEM, and 400 μCi of [3H]leucine. The pulse was continued for 2 h, which is the optimal time determined experimentally for labeling sufficient amounts of pro-TRH for later detection. This was followed by two washes with complete DMEM and a 4-h chase with complete DMEM containing a 4-fold excess of leucine. This 4-h chase was designed to allow for release of most or all of the recently synthesized peptide, which was traveling within the constitutive and or constitutive-like secretory pathways. The complete DMEM was then collected for immunoprecipitation of pro-TRH peptides and replaced with basal DMEM media lacking serum (basal media). After 1 h, basal medium was collected for immunoprecipitation and replaced with a defined secretion medium (basal media with 1 mm BaCl2 added as a secretagogue) designed to stimulate release of granule contents. This medium was collected for immunoprecipitation, and the cells were then scraped into cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. The cells were then lysed by addition of 500 μl of 2 n acetic acid with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and heating to 95 °C for 10 min. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Clarified lysates were then lyophilized to prepare them for immunoprecipitation. Media—Conditioned media were first precleared with normal rabbit serum (3 μg/5 ml of media; normal rabbit serum was from BIOSOURCE) and 50 μl of 50% proteinA/G-plus resin for 1 h at 4° C.The precleared media were then placed in a fresh tube containing 30 μl of proteinA/G-plus-agarose preconjugated to 5 μg of either α-pFE22 or α-pAV37. The immunoprecipitation was allowed to continue overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. The protein A/G-agarose-antibody conjugates were collected by centrifugation and then washed three times in wash buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) followed by one wash in PBS. 2× SDS-PAGE-Sample buffer was then added to the beads, and the sample was boiled for 10 min. The tubes were centrifuged for 30 s, and the supernatants were fractionated with Tris/Tricine gels as described previously (37Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Gels were then cut into 2-mm slices with a gel slicer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco) and placed individually into scintillation vials. Peptides were extracted from the gel slices with a 16-h incubation at room temperature in 500 μlof2 n acetic acid. Radioactivity was determined by addition of 5 ml of Bio-Safe II scintillation fluid (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) followed by 10 min of counting per tube in a beta counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Counts/min were determined automatically. Cell Content—Lyophilized cell content was solubilized in 500 μl of resuspension buffer (0.5% BSA, 17 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.4) and cleared of insoluble material by centrifuging at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysate was then precleared, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed as described for the media samples. To correct for the fact that counts/min measurements only determine amounts of [3H]leucine and not relative amounts of peptide recovered, the counts/min of lower molecular weight peaks recovered by immunoprecipitation were multiplied by the following formula: corrected cpm = (determined cpm) × (number of leucines expected in highest molecular weight peak recovered/number of leucines expected in other recovered peak/s). By utilizing this formula, all cpm results are presented as the theoretical value that would have been obtained had each peptide recovered contained the same number of leucines thus indicating the relative abundance of each prepro-TRH-derived peptide recovered. Immunocytochemistry experiments were conducted as described previously (2Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5651-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, AtT20 or GH4C1 cells were fixed for 1 h with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate sucrose buffer (PSB: 120 mm sucrose, 100 mm PIPES, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8). Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PSB for 7 min. Cells were then washed with 1% BSA in PSB, followed by three 10-min washes with 100 mm NH4Cl in PBS (buffer A). The cells were then incubated in buffer A with 5% BSA for 1 h followed by three washes with 100 mm NH4Cl in PBS. Antibody was added to the cells at a 1:1,000 dilution in buffer A with 0.2% normal goat serum (buffer B) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day cells were washed three times with buffer B and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Vector Labs Burlingame, CA) for 2 h in buffer B. Cells were then washed three times in buffer B and then covered with mounting media containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). This mounting medium is used to stain cell nuclei and to protect against photobleaching. Confocal images were acquired with a Nikon PCM 2000 digital camera (Nikon Inc. Mellville, NY) using the argon (488) laser. Serial optical sections were performed with Simple 32, C-imaging computer software (Compix Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Z series sections were collected at 0.7 μm with a ×60 PlanApo lens and a scan zoom of ×1. Images were processed and reconstructed in NIH Image shareware (National Institutes of Health, Springfield VA). PC1 Increases Regulated Sorting of Pro-TRH in GH4C1 Cells—To test if the presence of active PC1 enzyme was necessary for proper sorting of pro-TRH-derived peptides, we transiently transfected either GH4C1 or GH4C1 cells stably expressing PC1 (GH4C1-PC1). GH4C1 cells are known to lack PC1 and PC2, possess secretory granules, and possess the ability to sort and store endogenously and exogenously expressed proteins to the regulated secretory pathway with modest efficiency (35Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Arvan P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1959-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), making them an ideal neuroendocrine cell line to test the importance of PC1 processing on pro-TRH sorting. For these experiments we had the use of one clonal GH4C1-PC1 cell line. This line was described to express PC1, sort PC1 to the regulated secretory pathway, and to increase the regulated storage and release of exogenously expressed proinsulin (35Kuliawat R. Prabakaran D. Arvan P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1959-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To follow the processing and sorting of pro-TRH, we conducted pulse-chase experiments. It is a well reported fact that although tumoral cell lines serve as a good model to study protein trafficking to the regulated secretory pathway, the majority of their newly synthesized material is released in an unregulated fashion (38Moore H.P. Andresen J.M. Eaton B.A. Grabe M. Haugwitz M. Wu M.M. Machen T.E. Arch. Physiol. Biochem. 2002; 110: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For this reason the pulse-chase experiment is designed with a long initial chase of 4 h to allow material that has not entered the regulated secretory pathway to exit constitutively. The long chase is then followed by two 1-h chases that allow us to study protein release from secretory granules under basal and stimulated conditions. Under these experiments we determined that protein is sorted to the regulated secretory pathway if there is an increase in labeled peptide release in the presence of secretagogue. If release is absent or continues at a similar rate under the last two chase conditions, we know that protein is being secreted via the constitutive and/or constitutive-like secretory pathways. Expression levels were double-checked by RIA (data not shown). For these experiments we chose to use α-pFE22 for immunoprecipitation because it recognizes intact pro-TRH and several processing intermediates (Fig. 1 and TABLE ONE) and is affinity-purified, increasing its specificity. Under these conditions we observed that in the absence of PC1 and PC2 pro-TRH was still processed into mature peptides (prepro-TRH-(178–199), pFE22), but these mature forms and intact pro-TRH were recovered during the 4-h chase only and thus not stored in compartments for stimulated release indicating mis-sorting (Fig. 2A). Processing of pro-TRH observed in GH4C1 cells is most likely mediated by furin, which can process pro-TRH very efficiently, generating TRH and all non-TRH peptides (33Schaner P. Todd R.B. Seidah N.G. Nillni E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19958-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Intact pro-TRH and a peak expected to be mature pFE22 were recovered from GH4C1-PC1 cells during the 4-h chase indicating that much of the newly synthesized pro-TRH is released in a constitutive and constitutive-like fashion as expected from a tumoral cell line. However, no pro-TRH was recovered during the basal period, and a significant amount of pFE22 was released during the subsequent 1-h incubation with secretagogue (26.2 ± 3.2% of total recovered peptide, n = 3; Fig. 2B). In contrast GH4C1 cells did not exhibit any significant stimulated release of pro-TRH peptides in the presence of secretagogue (11.9 ± 11% of total recovered peptide, n = 3; Fig. 2A). This indicates that pro-TRH was sorted to secretory granules where release was dependent on the secretagogue in GH4C1-PC1 cells. Notably, only mature pFE22 was recovered from the cells during incubation with the secretagogue indicating that pro-TRH was also more efficiently processed when targeted to the regulated secretory pathway. Only when PC1 was present was regulated release observed, indicating that PC1 processing, which occurs at the TGN, is impo"

Yeast. 2004; 21: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently the killing mechanism of this killer toxin has been elucidated (10Santos A. Marquina D. Yeast. 2004; 21: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Regardless of certain possible additional effects, the killer toxin of P. membranifaciens CYC 1106 acts by disrupting plasma membrane electrochemical gradients. The death of sensitive cells in the presence of killer toxin is characterized by a leakage of common physiological ions through non-regulated ion channels in the plasma membrane causing a discharge of cellular membrane potential and changes in ionic homeostasis in a way comparable to that of certain killer toxins (K1) (11Kagan B.L. Nature. 1983; 302: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Non-selective channel formation has been suggested to be the cytotoxic mechanism of action of PMKT (10Santos A. Marquina D.

Yeasts must cope with different adverse environmental conditions, including heat shock, oxidative stress, high osmolarity, extreme pH values, nutrient availability, and toxins from plants, fungi, or bacteria as well as heavy metals and different xenobiotics. Yeasts have therefore adapted to growth under these conditions by developing a variety of protective mechanisms ranging from general stress responses to highly specific regulatory pathways. A variety of changes in the environment activate multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, which convert these signals into appropriate metabolic responses (12Kapteyn J.C. Ter Riet B.

Five mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades that coordinate intracellular activities in response to rapidly changing environmental conditions have been characterized (14Madhani H.D. Fink G.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 151-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Because of our knowledge about its sequenced genome and the availability of powerful genetic tools, S. cerevisiae has been a particularly valuable model system for studying such responses. Of particular significance for this unicellular eukaryote is its response to changes in the osmolarity of the medium. Yeast cells are able to detect and respond to changes in osmolarity by two independent osmosensors: Sln1p and Sho1p (15Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 16Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 17Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). These membrane-bound proteins activate the so-called high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and this results in a rise in the intracellular glycerol concentration to adapt the cellular osmotic pressure and to prevent the loss of water (18Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These survival mechanisms must operate within the first seconds after a sudden osmotic shift because water loss or uptake occurs very fast (22Blomberg A. Adler L. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1992; 33: 145-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of glycerol synthesis is achieved by increasing the transcription of genes such as GPD1 (encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), GPP2 (glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase), HSP12 (heat shock protein), CTT1 (cytosolic catalase T), YAP4 (yeast activator protein), STL1 (encoding a member of the hexose transporter family of the major facilitator superfamily), etc. (23Albertyn J.

Regardless of their effects on osmolarity, high concentrations of certain ions, such as lithium or sodium, may be toxic for yeast cells because they block several metabolic reactions (34Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29029-29033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this case, the transcriptional activation of the ENA1 gene, which encodes a P-type ATPase, is required for the efflux of sodium ions (35Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 36Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J. Davidow L.S. Mao J.I. Moir D.T. Cell. 1998; 58: 133-145Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Two plasma membrane proteins, Psr1p and Psr2p, are essential for an efficient sodium ion stress response through transcriptional activation of ENA1 (37Siniossoglou S. Hurt E.C. Pelham H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19352-19360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Apart from the HOG-dependent induction during sodium ion stress, ENA1 transcription is also induced by another independent pathway mediated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (38Heath V.L.

The aim of this study was to determine the global gene expression responses of S. cerevisiae to the killer toxin produced by P. membranifaciens CYC 1106 with a view to gaining insight into the mechanisms and processes underlying the killing of sensitive yeast cells. Here for the first time we report evidence that the transcriptional response of S. cerevisiae to the presence of PMKT is very similar to the response of cells undergoing adaptation to ionic or osmotic changes in the cellular environment. Western analysis of the signaling through the HOG pathway revealed a Hog1p phosphorylation in response to PMKT. The analysis of arrayed ORFs was complemented and extended by the fact that a high proportion of deletion mutants of genes whose expression was observed to be affected by PMKT had altered sensitivity phenotypes. Yeast Strains and General Media—The killer strain used in this study was P. membranifaciens CYC 1106 (Complutense Yeast Collection, Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain) originally isolated from olive brines (41Marquina D. Peres C. Caldas F.V. Marques J.F. Peinado J.M. Spencer-Martins I. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 14: 279-283Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The sensitive wild-type strain used in this study was S. cerevisiae Hansen BY4743 (MATa/MATα his3Δ1/his3Δ1 leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0 LYS2/lys2Δ0 MET15/met15Δ0 ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0) (deletion parental strains, catalog number 95400.BY4743, Invitrogen). Deletant strains were from the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project and are available commercially at Invitrogen (Yeast Deletion Pools-Homozygous Diploid, catalog number 95401.H1Pool). Homozygous diploids mutants were BY4743 (orf Δ::kan MX4/orf Δ::kan MX4). The basic medium used for this study was YMA medium (1% (w/v) glucose, 0.3% (w/v) yeast extract (Difco), 0.3% (w/v) malt extract (Difco), 0.5% (w/v) proteose peptone Number 3 (Difco), and 2% agar). The strains were maintained at 20 °C in YMA medium supplemented with 15% glycerol, 200 mg/liter G418 (Geneticin), and 2% agar. Time course experiments of the killing process were carried out in buffered YMB medium (YMA medium without glycerol, Geneticin, and agar) and buffered with 100 mm sodium citrate-phosphate, pH 4.0. Killer toxin activity was determined on YMA-MB agar plates (YMA medium (without glycerol and Geneticin) supplemented with 30 mg/liter methylene blue and 100 mm sodium citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4.0). Killer Toxin Assay—We assayed for killer toxin sensitivity with a diffusion test using 6-mm-diameter antibiotic assay AA Whatman paper discs on buffered YMA-MB seeded with the selected S. cerevisiae mutant strains in parallel with the wild-type strain. Incubation was carried out at 20 °C because killer factor is rapidly inactivated at temperatures above 25 °C. The diameter of the inhibition zone was used as a measure of sensitivity to the killer toxin. For each mutant, sensitivity was tested up to three times, and the results were compared with those from the wild-type strain ((mutant inhibition area)/(wild-type inhibition area) × 100). Purification Procedure—P. membranifaciens CYC 1106 was cultured in YNB-D-Brij 58 medium (yeast nitrogen base-dextrose; Difco), 3 × 1 liter, in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks for 3 days at 20 °C at 150 rpm. The cells were centrifuged (4,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was adjusted to a final glycerol concentration of 15% (v/v). The purification process was done as reported previously (9Santos A. Marquina D. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2527-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cell Death—S. cerevisiae BY4743 cells were grown to logarithmic phase in buffered YMB medium, collected, and subsequently resuspended in the same medium containing killer activity (1,205 AU/ml). The final cell concentration was 106 cells/ml. A control with heat-inactivated (5 min at 75 °C) killer toxin was run in parallel. Aliquots were taken periodically, and additional 10-fold dilutions were made serially to a final dilution of 10–4. Four volumes of 50 μl each were used for plating on YMA medium. The colonies were counted after 48 h of growth at 30 °C. Experimental Design and RNA Isolation—For RNA isolation, time course experiments of the killing process, using S. cerevisiae BY4743, were performed as three independent biological repeats. Approximately 200 ml of asynchronously grown cells were cultured in YMB medium (buffered with 100 mm sodium citrate-phosphate, pH 4.0) at 20 °C, shaking at 125 rpm until an A600 of 0.5 was reached. Ten milliliters of cells were harvested by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (at this point cells were collected for determination of expression profiles under basal conditions). Immediately afterward the rest of the culture was exposed to the killer toxin (1,205 AU/ml), and samples of 10 ml each were collected at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min. Then samples for RNA extraction were harvested and frozen as above. Total RNA was extracted using the hot acid phenol method (42Lyne R. Burns G. Mata J. Penkett C.J. Rustici G. Chen D. Langford C. Vetrie D. Bähler J. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Microarray Hybridization, Scanning, and Data Acquisition—Based on the results on cell death, measured by plating, reverse transcription (Superscript, Invitrogen) was performed for 40 μg using total RNA extracted from cells after 45 min of exposure to PMKT. After the Cy3- and Cy5-dCTP-labeled cDNAs had been hybridized onto glass DNA microarrays containing 100% of all known and predicted S. cerevisiae genes, 40 μl of the mixed cDNA solution were allowed to hybridize to the microarrays at 62 °C for 12 h (Agilent hybridization chamber, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). When the hybridization process was completed, the microarrays were washed with buffer A (0.1% SDS, 0.6× SSC) at 50 °C followed by a 5-min wash in buffer B (0.03× SSC) at 20 °C. Microarrays were scanned with Agilent scanner G2565BA (Agilent Technologies), and microarray images were analyzed with Agilent Feature Extraction software, version 7.5 (43DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3690) Google Scholar, 44Spellman P.T. Sherlock G. Zhang M.Q. Iyer V.R. Anders K. Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3888) Google Scholar). If expression ratios were >+3.0 (up-regulated) or <-2.0 (down-regulated) in four different arrays, the corresponding genes were then considered to be expressed differentially, and the average ratio from the change in expression was calculated and treated as the true ratio between the different arrays. Only genes with constant expression ratios between different experiments were considered. It must be taken into account that a large proportion of the genes (those between +3.0-fold induction and –2.0-fold repression) responded, according to our results, in an apparently random manner. It is known that when a stimulus occurs the nature of regulated transcripts changes over time, suggesting that different functions need to be activated at different time points. The origin of this variability is unknown but may be due to events that affect cells at different moments of the killing process but not simultaneously for the whole PMKT-treated yeast population. Other possibilities are small differences in toxin purity (high performance liquid chromatography-tested), media composition, or cell age. In light of this, we decided to confirm these results with quantitative real time PCR under the assumption that the constantly expressed genes were the main ones involved in the underlying process of killing. Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was obtained from cells at a time point of 45 min and then treated with DNase I (Sigma). cDNA was synthesized from samples of 1.5 μg of total RNA making use of the random primer procedure and the RETRoscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. Q-PCR was performed on an ABI PRISM® 7900 HT (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) device using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and specific oligonucleotide primers at a concentration of 300 nm. Matching oligonucleotide primers were designed using the Primer Express software (PerkinElmer-Applied Biosystems) and Oligo software (Oligo Analizer) and synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (Sigma-Genosys, Ltd). Amplification of cDNA was performed over 40 cycles. The first cycle was performed at 95 °C for 10 min. Cycles 2–40 were performed at 95 °C for 15 s followed by 60 °C for 1 min. Each assay was performed in quadruplicate. For normalization of cDNA loading, all samples were run in parallel with a housekeeping gene (IPP1, inorganic pyrophosphatase). The specificity of PCR amplifications from the different sets of oligonucleotide primers was examined routinely by agarose gel electrophoresis. Northern Blot Analysis of the PMKT-dependent Genes—According to the results from microarrays, confirmed by Q-PCR, some osmoresponsive genes (GPD1 and GPP2) as well as CTT1 and HSP12, two general stress-responsive genes; PDR12 and TRK2, two genes highly induced at low pH; and ENA1, a gene known to be induced under high salt conditions, were studied by Northern blotting (32Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5474-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To determine the extent of induction or repression of gene expression, all signals were compared with IPP1, which encodes inorganic pyrophosphatase, whose expression is not affected by osmotic stress (33Rep M. Krantz M. Thevelein M.J. Hohmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8290-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cells (BY4743 and hog1Δ) at the selected time points (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min), separated by formaldehyde gels, and transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond XL, Amersham Biosciences). Probes were generated by PCR from chromosomal DNA of BY4743. PCR probes of GPD1, GPP2, CTT1, HSP12, PDR12, TRK2, ENA1, and IPP1 were radiolabeled by random priming with [α-32P]ATP (MegaPrime, Amersham Biosciences), G-50-purified, and hybridized overnight at 65 °C in hybridization buffer (7% (w/v) SDS, 0.25 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). The blots were washed (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 1 mm EDTA), and the signal was detected either by exposure to radiosensitive film (Biomax MR, Eastman Kodak Co.). Values were normalized by comparison with IPP1 signals. Western Blotting of Hog1p and Hog1p Phosphorylation—Separation of total soluble protein (30 μg of total protein), isolated as described previously (45Davenport K.R. Sohaskey M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. Gustin M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 270: 30157-30161Google Scholar, 46Siderius M. Rots E. Mager W.H. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3241-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was accomplished on 12% polyacrylamide gels (BioRad), whereas subsequent Western blotting of Hog1p and phosphorylated Hog1p was performed according to standard procedures on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Briefly total soluble protein was isolated from S. cerevisiae BY4743 strain grown in buffered YMB medium after 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min of exposure to PMKT. Dual phosphorylation of Hog1p was determined using an anti-dually phosphorylated (Thr-174 and Tyr-176) p38 antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Hog1p was detected using an anti-C-terminal Hog1p antibody (Yc20, catalog number sc-6815, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody binding was visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) after the binding of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Glycerol Determination—Cells (BY4743 and hog1Δ) grown overnight in YMB medium (buffered with 100 mm sodium citrate-phosphate, pH 4.0) at 20 °C were diluted to an A600 of 0.3 and grown for 4 h at 20°C. Cells were then subjected to PMKT (1,205 AU/ml). At time points (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 4 h) and in triplicate, 10-ml samples were taken for glycerol and dry weight determinations. Intracellular glycerol was determined by filtration with glass microfiber filters (Whatman GF/C), measuring the glycerol released by boiling the filters for 10 min. Dry weight was determined by drying filters with cells at 80 °C for 16 h. To determine the glycerol concentration of the extracellular medium during PMKT treatment, 1-ml samples of the treated cultures were centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for glycerol assays. Glycerol was determined with a glycerol measurement kit (catalog number 148270, Roche Applied Science). Genome-wide Gene Expression Profiles—To examine the gene expression response to PMKT a time course study of the killing process was carried out. After exposure of asynchronously grown cells to PMKT at times between 0 and 8 h (not shown), cell death was observed to begin after 1 h. The cell death rate in the presence of PMKT (1,205 AU/ml) was 0.22 h–1. From these death kinetics, a PMKT dosage of 1,205 AU/ml and sampling times of 0 min (untreated control) and 45 min (treated cells) after exposure to PMKT were chosen for mRNA isolation and subsequent microarray studies and Q-PCR. Genome-wide gene expression profiles of S. cerevisiae cultures grown asynchronously were examined after exposure to PMKT using whole-genome microarrays and Q-PCR. Similar results were observed for mRNA expression levels using both techniques. Validation of microarray results with Q-PCR was done to verify that array data were not the result of problems inherent to the array technology. The grouped distribution of genes that were either up- or down-regulated after exposure to PMKT (TABLES ONE and TWO) provided information pertinent to the killing mechanism of PMKT and to the response of S. cerevisiae to the toxin at the molecular level. The mRNA level of a total of 99 genes was at least 3-fold higher after the addition of PMKT (TABLE ONE). Forty-seven genes were observed to exhibit 2-fold or higher repression levels after 45 min of exposure to PMKT (TABLE TWO).TABLE ONEGenes induced by more than 3-fold after a PMKT exposureGene nameORFDescription of gene product-Fold inductionPMKT death zoneMicroarraysQ-RT-PCR%Signal transduction, gene expression, transcription, and RNA processing (31 genes)TFS1YLR178CCdc25-dependent nutrient and ammonia response cell cycle regulator15.312.5108GSP2YOR185CGTP-binding protein involved in trafficking through nuclear pores5.14.3104NAM8YHR086WProtein involved in meiotic recombination10.210.1106GIP2YER054CGlc7p-interacting protein4.33.8105SDS22YKL193CRegulatory subunit for the mitotic function of type I protein phosphatase5.54.8106YAP1aORFs falling into different categories.YML007WTranscription factor involved in halotolerance and oxidative stress response12.711.6121CUP2YGL166WCopper-dependent transcription factor6.67.2103XBP1aORFs falling into different categories.YIL101CStress-induced transcriptional repressor3.83.6WTREG1YDR028CRegulatory subunit for protein phosphatase Glc7p4.14.1102PAP1YKR002WPoly(A) polymerase required for mRNA 3′ end formation4.03.9108KSP1YHR082CSerine/threonine protein kinase5.24.3114KKQ8YKL168CWeak similarity to serine/threonine protein kinase14.111.7109PTK2YJR059WSerine/threonine protein kinase of required for polyamine uptake8.16.4104AKL1YBR059CArk family kinase-like protein; probable serine/threonine-specific protein kinase3.53.3110SCH9aORFs falling into different categories.YHR205WSerine/threonine protein kinase involved in stress response and nutrient-sensing signaling pathway10.612.5138STE20YHL007CSerine/threonine protein kinase of the pheromone pathway15.913.8114PSK1aORFs falling into different categories.YAL017WPAS kinase involved in the control of sugar metabolism and translation8.510.1123PBS2YJL128CTyrosine protein kinase of the MAP kinase kinase family19.918.5125MED2YDL005CTranscriptional regulation mediator15.314.5103ITC1YGL133WSubunit of Isw2 chromatin-remodeling complex6.68.4107SW16YLR182WTranscription factor3.32.3103TIS11YLR136CtRNA-specific adenosine deaminase 37.15.3WTUGA3YDL170WTranscriptional activator for GABA catabolic genes3.24.3104SRB2YHR041CDNA-dire"
https://openalex.org/W2145499795,"Pluripotent neural crest (NC) cells differentiate to diverse lineages, including the neuronal, sympathoadrenal lineage. In primary NC cultures, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) requires moderate activation of cAMP signaling for induction of the sympathoadrenal lineage. However, the mechanism by which cAMP signaling synergizes with BMP2 to induce the sympathodrenal lineage is unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that moderate activation of cAMP signaling induces both transcription and activity of proneural transcription factor Phox2a. In NC cultures inhibition of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription by expression of dominant-negative CREB suppresses Phox2a transcription and sympathoadrenal lineage development. Interestingly, the constitutively active CREBDIEDML, despite inducing Phox2a transcription, is insufficient for sympathoadrenal lineage development, requiring activation of the cAMP pathway. Because CREBDIEDML-mediates cAMP-dependent transcription without requiring activation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), these results identify PKA activation as necessary in sympathoadrenal lineage development. Treatment of NC cultures with the PKA inhibitor H89 or 1-10 nm okadaic acid (OA), a serine/threonine PP2A-like phosphatase inhibitor, suppresses sympathoadrenal lineage development. Likewise, OA treatment of the CNS-derived catecholaminergic CAD cell line inhibits cAMP-mediated neuronal differentiation. Specifically, OA inhibits cAMP-mediated Phox2a dephosphorylation, cAMP-dependent Phox2a DNA binding in vitro, and cAMP- and Phox2a-dependent dopamine-β-hydroxylase-luciferase reporter expression. Together, these results support cAMP-dependent Phox2a dephosphorylation is required for its activation. We conclude that moderate activation of cAMP signaling has dual inputs in catecholaminergic, sympathoadrenal lineage development; that is, regulation of both Phox2a transcription and activity. These results provide the first mechanistic understanding of how moderate activation of the cAMP pathway in synergy with BMP2 promotes sympathoadrenal lineage development. Pluripotent neural crest (NC) cells differentiate to diverse lineages, including the neuronal, sympathoadrenal lineage. In primary NC cultures, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) requires moderate activation of cAMP signaling for induction of the sympathoadrenal lineage. However, the mechanism by which cAMP signaling synergizes with BMP2 to induce the sympathodrenal lineage is unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that moderate activation of cAMP signaling induces both transcription and activity of proneural transcription factor Phox2a. In NC cultures inhibition of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription by expression of dominant-negative CREB suppresses Phox2a transcription and sympathoadrenal lineage development. Interestingly, the constitutively active CREBDIEDML, despite inducing Phox2a transcription, is insufficient for sympathoadrenal lineage development, requiring activation of the cAMP pathway. Because CREBDIEDML-mediates cAMP-dependent transcription without requiring activation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), these results identify PKA activation as necessary in sympathoadrenal lineage development. Treatment of NC cultures with the PKA inhibitor H89 or 1-10 nm okadaic acid (OA), a serine/threonine PP2A-like phosphatase inhibitor, suppresses sympathoadrenal lineage development. Likewise, OA treatment of the CNS-derived catecholaminergic CAD cell line inhibits cAMP-mediated neuronal differentiation. Specifically, OA inhibits cAMP-mediated Phox2a dephosphorylation, cAMP-dependent Phox2a DNA binding in vitro, and cAMP- and Phox2a-dependent dopamine-β-hydroxylase-luciferase reporter expression. Together, these results support cAMP-dependent Phox2a dephosphorylation is required for its activation. We conclude that moderate activation of cAMP signaling has dual inputs in catecholaminergic, sympathoadrenal lineage development; that is, regulation of both Phox2a transcription and activity. These results provide the first mechanistic understanding of how moderate activation of the cAMP pathway in synergy with BMP2 promotes sympathoadrenal lineage development.

Importantly, our earlier studies (16Bilodeau M.L. Boulineau T. Hullinger R. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) demonstrated moderate activation of cAMP signaling synergizes with BMP2 in promoting development of the SA lineage. However, the molecular mechanism by which cAMP signaling in synergy with BMP2 promotes SA cell development is unknown. The cAMP pathway (18Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar), via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), activates the transcription factor CREB by Ser-133 phosphorylation (19Andrisani O.M.

Phospho-CREB interacts with the coactivator CBP/p300, mediating cAMP-dependent transcription (21Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). CREB null mice (22Lonze B.E. Riccio A. Cohen S. Ginty D.

These results implicate CREB in sympathetic neuron development by an unknown mechanism. Herein, we investigate how cAMP signaling promotes SA cell development by examining the role of CREB and PKA activation in development of NC cells to the SA lineage. Transcription factors required for SA cell development include ASH1 or MASH1 (23Guillemot F. Lo L.-C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L.

Ernsberger U. Unsicker K. Development. 2002; 129: 4729-4738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in Phox2a expression. Phox2a -/- mice lack the locus ceruleus, a major catecholaminergic center in the central nervous system (CNS), but Phox2b expression and sympathetic neuron development is largely normal (30Morin X. Cremer H. Hirsch M.-R. Kapur R.P. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F Neuron. 1997; 18: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In Phox2b null embryos, NC cells migrate to the dorsal aorta and express MASH1, but catecholaminergic neurons fail to develop (31Pattyn A. Morin X. Cremer H. Goridis C. Brunet J.-F. Nature. 1999; 399: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In vivo Phox2a or Phox2b overexpression generates additional noradrenergic and cholinergic neurons (33Stanke M. Junghans D. Geissen M. Goridis C. Ernsberger U. Rohrer H. Development. 1999; 126: 4087-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, in vitro in primary NC cultures Phox2a overexpression induces TH expression and SA cell development only with activation of cAMP signaling (15Lo L. Morin X. Brunet J.F. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, these studies (15Lo L. Morin X. Brunet J.F. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) under-score the importance of the cAMP pathway in Phox2a action and SA cell development. cAMP signaling is also required for Phox2a-mediated transcription from the TH- and DBH-luciferase reporters studied in NC-derived PC12 cells and CNS-derived catecholaminergic Cath.a cells (34Zellmer E. Zhang Z. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Swanson D.J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Biol.

Thus, cAMP signaling is important in Phox2a activation, studied by employing Phox2a-responsive reporter constructs in established cell lines. However, the mechanism by which cAMP signaling induces development of primary NC cells to the SA lineage and, specifically, the role of cAMP signaling in Phox2a regulation in NC cells is unknown. Herein, we examine the role of the cAMP pathway in catecholaminergic cell development employing avian primary NC cultures, in conjunction with the CNS-derived catecholaminergic Cath.a cell line (37Suri C. Fung B.P. Tischler A.S. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line provides another cellular model for comparative studies of NC-derived and CNS-derived catecholaminergic neuron development. The Cath.a cell line originated from brain tumors of transgenic mice expressing the SV40 T-antigen under control of the TH promoter (37Suri C. Fung B.P. Tischler A.S. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cath.a cells, like catecholaminergic SA cells, are characterized by expression of TH and DBH, synthesis of catecholamines, and development of neurites. The CAD cell line used herein, a variant of the Cath.a cell line, undergoes neuronal differentiation characterized by expression of TH and development of neurites (17Bilodeau M.L. Ji M. Paris M. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 38Qi Y. Wang J.K. McMillian M. Chikaraishi D.M. J.

Neurosci. 2005; 29: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Herein, we demonstrate the molecular mechanism and the essential role of the cAMP pathway in catecholaminergic, sympathoadrenal lineage development; the cAMP pathway has dual inputs in sympathoadrenal cell development, namely, transcriptional induction of proneural Phox2a by CREB and regulation of Phox2a activity by PKA. Neural Crest Cell Cultures—Primary cultures of NC cells were prepared from J. quail embryos, stage 14-15 (39Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 195: 231-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar), as described (16Bilodeau M.L. Boulineau T. Hullinger R. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, 48-h embryo explants from trunk region of neural tube were cultured for 42 h. After removal of neural tube (Fig. 1A, day 0), the remaining cells are NC cells, assessed by HNK1-positive immunostaining. Mass cultures of NC cells (day 0) were harvested by trypsin treatment and replated at a density of 320 cells/mm2 (16Bilodeau M.L. Boulineau T. Hullinger R. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Clonal cultures of NC cells (day 0) were replated at density of 300 cells/35-mm dish in dishes coated with Vitrogen 100 (Collagen Corp.) and bovine fibronectin (20 μg/ml). Growth Media and Other Reagents—Reagents for NC cultures were described in Bilodeau et al. (16Bilodeau M.L. Boulineau T. Hullinger R. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Concentrations of other reagents used were 10 ng/ml BMP2 (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.), 100 μm 3-isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; Sigma), 1-10 nm okadaic acid (OA; Sigma), and 5-10 μm H89 (Sigma), as indicated. Chicken embryo fibroblast cultures were from embryonic day 10 chicks, cultured as described (40Fekete D.M. Cepko C.L. Mol. Cell.

McMillian M. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% fetal calf serum or in serum-free media containing sodium selenite (50 mg/ml) for onset of differentiation. Transient Transfections—DBH-luciferase reporter (50 ng) co-transfected with Phox2a (36Adachi M. Lewis E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22915-22924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) expression vector (500 ng) in NC or CAD cells by the FuGENE 6 method (Roche Applied Science). Cells transfected for 24 h were pretreated (30 min.) with 10-100 nm OA followed by the addition (2 h) of BMP2 and IBMX (36Adachi M. Lewis E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22915-22924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After the 2-h treatment, cells were assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was normalized per μg of protein extract. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described (42Andrisani O.M. Pot D.A. Zhu Z. Dixon J.E. Mol. Cell.

Lewis E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22915-22924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunodetection and Histofluorescence—TH expression was monitored by Western blot analyses and immunofluorescence microscopy (16Bilodeau M.L. Boulineau T. Hullinger R. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of foreign protein expression, those fused to FLAG epitope, was via the M2 antibody (Sigma) or to E1A protein antibody (Lab Vision, Inc). For immunofluorescence of Phox2a, CAD cells were permeabilized (30 min) in PBT (0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in calcium-magnesium-free-phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4)) containing 1% goat serum; Phox2a antibody (Chemicon International) was added (1:200) in PBT containing 1% goat serum. Phox2a immunoprecipitations were performed with Phox2a antibody (Sigma) and 1 mg of whole cell extract (WCE) from CAD cells grown with IBMX, IBMX and OA (10 nm), or PD 98059 (20 μm). Phox2a immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with (1:2000) phospho-Thr/Ser-Pro-specific antibody (Cell Signaling). Western blot analyses for activated CREB employed phospho-CREB or CREB antibodies (Upstate) and WCE from NC cultures serum-starved (1 h) followed by treatment (10 min) with IBMX or forskolin (0.1-10 μm). Histofluorescence of catecholamines was performed as described in Furness et al. (43Furness J.B. Costa M. Wilson A.J.

Virol. 1999; 64: 4421-4427Crossref Google Scholar) were cloned into the ClaI site of the RCASBP (A) vector by subcloning the PCR-generated inserts into SLAX12NCO plasmid (48Morgan B.A. Fekete D.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1996; 51: 185-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CREBDIEDML-FLAG insert generated by “sticky-end PCR” (49Zeng G. Biotechniques. 1998; 25: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) resulting in cohesive ClaI ends, was subcloned in SLAX12NCO. All subcloned inserts were sequenced. RCAS BP (A) vectors were transfected in chicken embryo fibroblast cells by the calcium phosphate method. 7-10 days following transfection, supernatants were collected and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (48Morgan B.A. Fekete D.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1996; 51: 185-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Hollenbeck P.J. Fekete D.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2003; 71: 369-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Viral titers were determined by immunostaining for p19gag protein employing the ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Typical titers were 109 IU/ml. NC cultures were infected at day 0 with 106 IU per 105 cells. Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated by the Trizol method (Invitrogen) from NC cultures (grown in 35-mm dishes) or CAD cells. cDNA (20 μl) was synthesized from 2 μg of RNA.cDNA(2 μl) was used in quantitative real-time PCR as described in detail in Lee et al.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3004-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) NC cultures require moderate activation of the cAMP pathway in synergy with BMP2 for SA lineage development. However, the mechanism by which cAMP signaling promotes SA cell development is unknown. To determine whether the cAMP pathway participates in SA cell development by regulating cAMP-responsive, CREB-mediated transcription, we expressed in primary NC cultures a dominant negative (44Ahn T. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) or a constitutively active (52Cardinaux J.R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q.H.

Methods Cell Biol. 1996; 51: 185-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RCAS vectors were also used encoding the wild type (WT) Ad2 12 S E1A, which interferes with CBP function required for CREB-mediated transcription. The inactive N-terminal deletion Δ2-32 E1A was used as negative control (45Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 46Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). To establish the infection kinetics of the RCAS viruses and the expression of the foreign proteins, a time course was performed employing NC cultures infected at day 0 (Fig. 1A). Western blot analyses of cellular extracts isolated from virus-infected NC cultures demonstrate the expression of the foreign proteins (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence microscopy at 24, 48 (Fig. 1C), and 72 h (data not shown) post-infection demonstrates that nearly 100% of the cells express the foreign proteins. Moderate activation of cAMP signaling by treatment with the cAMP-elevating agents IBMX (100 μm) or forskolin (0.1-1.0 μm) synergizes with BMP2, inducing expression of Phox2a (16Bilodeau M.L.

Herein, employing quantitative real-time PCR, we quantified Phox2a expression after treatment with IBMX in combination with BMP2. In comparison to IBMX, co-treatment with BMP2 and IBMX mediated a synergistic more than additive induction in Phox2a mRNA expression (Fig. 2A), suggesting the cAMP pathway together with BMP2 is involved in Phox2a transcription. Importantly, NC cultures treated with either IBMX or a low concentration of forskolin (0.1-1.0 μm) display CREB phosphorylation required for cAMP-mediated transcription (Fig. 2A). To demonstrate the transcriptional involvement of the cAMP pathway in Phox2a expression, we examined the effects of dominant negative ACREB (44Ahn T. Olive M. Aggarwal S. Krylov D. Ginty D.D. Vinson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 967-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and constitutively active CREBDIEDML (52Cardinaux J.R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q.H. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) via infection of NC cultures with the respective RCAS viruses. Infection of NC cultures at day 0 (Fig. 1A) with the control RCAS virus in the presence of both BMP2 and IBMX results in a progressive increase of Phox2a mRNA at day 2, reaching a maximal level by day 3 (Fig. 2B). By comparison, infection with RCAS-ACREB virus in the presence of BMP2 and IBMX interferes with Phox2a mRNA expression, reducing its expression by nearly 10-fold (Fig. 2B). Infection with RCAS-CREBDIEDML virus in the presence of BMP2 mediates Phox2a mRNA induction (Fig. 2C), comparable with that with BMP2 and IBMX (Fig. 2B). Because CREBDIEDML is transcriptionally active (52Cardinaux J.R. Notis J.C. Zhang Q.H. Vo N. Craig J.C. Fass D.M. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1546-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) without activation of the cAMP pathway, these results (Fig. 2C) directly demonstrate the transcriptional involvement of the cAMP pathway in Phox2a mRNA expression via active CREB. The co-activator CBP is required for CREB-mediated transcription (53Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). WT E1A represses CREB-dependent CBP function via direct interaction with CBP, whereas Δ2-32 E1A does not interact with CBP and does not interfere with CBP function (45Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 46Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H.

Accordingly, we examined the effect of WT E1A and its inactive Δ2-32 mutant on Phox2a mRNA expression in NC cultures infected with the respective viruses. WT E1A reduces Phox2a mRNA by day 3, reaching a 50% reduction by day 4. By contrast, the Δ2-32 E1A mutant has no noticeable effect (Fig. 2D). Although the mechanism of this E1A-mediated inhibition of Phox2a mRNA expression has not been further investigated, the results support CBP involvement in Phox2a expression.

The expression of BCL-2 was higher in M-MΦ, and M-CSF withdrawal down-regulated the expression. The expression of BCL-XL was higher in A-MΦ and GM-MΦ, and the expression was CSF-independent. The expression of MCL-1 and BAX were not different between M-MΦ and GM-MΦ and were CSF-independent. Down-regulation of the expression of BCL-2 and BCL-XL by RNA interference showed the important role of BCL-2 and BCL-XL in the survival of M-MΦ and GM-MΦ, respectively. Human erythrocyte catalase (HEC) and conditioned medium obtained from GM-MΦ or A-MΦ cultured in the absence of GM-CSF prevented the M-MΦ from apoptosis and restored the expression of BCL-2. The activity of the conditioned medium was abrogated by pretreatment with anti-HEC antibody. Anti-HEC antibody also induced the apoptosis of M-MΦ cultured in the presence of M-CSF and GM-MΦ and A-MΦ cultured in the presence or absence of GM-CSF and down-regulated the expression of BCL-2 and BCL-XL in these MΦs. GM-MΦ and A-MΦ, but not M-MΦ, can produce both extracellular catalase and cell-associated catalase in a CSF-independent manner.

In a previous study, we reported that human A-MΦ and GM-CSF-induced monocyte-derived macrophages (GM-MΦ) are resistant to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via their high basal and inducible levels of catalase activity and that M-CSF-induced monocyte-derived macrophages (M-MΦ) are sensitive to low levels of H2O2 with low levels of catalase activity (2Komuro I.

GM-MΦ is phenotypically identical to A-MΦ, whereas M-MΦ closely resembles peritoneal MΦ in respect to morphology, cell surface antigen expression, and several biological functions (2Komuro I.

These findings suggest that a high level of catalase activity enables long survival of GM-MΦ and A-MΦ with positive regulation of BCL-2 family protein.In this study, we found that M-MΦ absolutely require CSF for their survival and express high levels of BCL-2 gene and protein in the presence of M-CSF. In contrast to M-MΦ, GM-MΦ and A-MΦ can survive in the absence of CSF via high levels of BCL-XL gene and protein. We further examined the relation between catalase activity and distinct expression of BCL-2 family protein and make clear the roles of CSF in the regulation of catalase activity and BCL-2 family protein in human tissue macrophages under the influence of oxidative stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation and Culture of Macrophages—Monocytes (Mo) were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of normal healthy volunteers using a magnetic cell separation system (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) with anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody-coated microbeads as described previously (7Komuro I. Yokota Y. Yasuda S. Iwamoto A. Kagawa K.S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).

Oligonucleotides with random sequences were used as negative controls. Cells were treated with oligonucleotides complexed with Lipofectin (5 mg/ml; Invitrogen) cationic lipid delivery agent according to the manufacturer's directions.Assessment of Cell Number and Cell Viability—The number of adherent Mo and MΦ was determined by counting the liberated intact nuclei from lysed cells stained with 1% (w/v) cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (Cetavelone; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in 0.1 m citric acid with 0.05% (w/v) naphthol blue black (Sigma). Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue dye exclusion test.Assessment of Apoptosis—DNA fragmentation was detected by immunohistochemical staining using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling method (Apo-tag kit; Oncor Co.) or visualized as DNA ladder formation (5Hashimoto S.I. Komuro I. Yamada M. Akagawa K.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3619-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated with 1% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline for inactivation of endogenous peroxidase for 5 min at room temperature. Incorporation of digoxigenin-conjugated dUTP to the terminal 3′-OH of fragmented DNA by exogenous terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction products were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-digoxigenin antibody at 37 °C for 30 min and visualized with the substrate 3-3′ diaminobenzidine plus 0.6% H2O2.Cells were lysed with hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% Triton-X), and crude DNA was extracted from the lysed cells by incubation with 40 μg/ml RNase and 40 μg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 37 °C. The DNA was precipitated with final 50% propanol at -20 °C overnight and washed with 70% (w/v) ethanol. Electrophoresis was performed in 2% agarose at 50 V, and the migrated DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Transmission Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed by immersion in a 2.5% glutaraldehyde-2% paraformaldehyde mixture (10Shankaranarayanan P. Nigam S. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), followed by 1% glutaraldehyde-0.5% tannic acid diluted in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) at 4 °C for 2 h. Samples were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 (osmium tetroxide; Wako) at 4 °C for 2 h and then embedded in epoxy resin (Epok 812; Okenshoji. Co., Ltd., Tokyo). Thin sections were cut using a LKB-8800 ultratome (LKB, Uppsala, Sweden) and observed using a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi H-7000) after staining with uranyl acetate (Serva Electrophoresis GmbH)-0.2% lead citrate buffer (Wako).Neutralization of Conditioned Medium—Conditioned medium was obtained from MΦ cultured in medium alone for 48 h at 37 °C and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml rabbit anti-human erythrocyte catalase (HEC) IgG (lot PTC 9301; Athens Research and Technology, Inc., Athens GA) or with normal rabbit IgG (Organon Teknika Co.) as a control.Measurement of Catalase Activity—Intracellular and extracellular catalase activity was measured according to Aebi's modified method as described previously (2Komuro I. Keicho N. Iwamoto A. Akagawa K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24360-24364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Purified HEC (5 × 104 units/mg, lot 643793; Calbiochem-Nova Biochem) was used for conversion of the catalase activity in samples into real catalase activity, and the activity was expressed as milliunits/ml per 2.5 × 105 cells or units/mg protein. Protein was measured using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories).Measurement of GSH Level—The total GSH level was determined using a BIOXYTECH S. A. kit. Briefly, the cells were lysed with 5% metaphosphoric acid, and the chromophore formation catalyzed at pH 13.4 was measured at 400 nm as described previously (15Anderson M.E. Dolphind D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. A. 1989: 339-365Google Scholar). The intracellular GSH level was expressed as pmol/mg protein.Isolation of RNA and Northern Blot Analysis—Isolation of total RNA and Northern blot analysis were performed as described previously (5Hashimoto S.I. Komuro I. Yamada M. Akagawa K.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3619-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized with cDNA probes against human catalase (kindly donated by Dr. K. Onozaki, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University) and β-actin (Sigma). All the probes were labeled using a multiprime DNA-labeling system with [α-32P]dCTP (New England Nuclear Research Products, Boston, MA). The blots were analyzed using a Fuji BAS 2000 bioimage analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo).Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed as described in our previous report (7Komuro I. Yokota Y. Yasuda S. Iwamoto A. Kagawa K.S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 mg/ml rabbit anti-HEC antibody (anti-Cat Ab; Athens Research and Technology, Inc.), mouse anti-BCL-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-BCL-xL/S antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-BCL-X antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), mouse anti-MCL-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-BAX antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or normal rabbit or mouse IgG and then at room temperature for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were visualized with Amersham ECL reagent on Hyper ECL film (Amersham Biosciences).Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNAs (1 mg) were prepared by use of RNA Zol B (Cinna/Biotecx Laboratories, Friendswood, TX) and reverse transcribed by incubation in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 6.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, each dNTP at 1 mm, 2 mm random primer, and 2.4 units/ml Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase for 1 h at 42°C (Takara Shyzo, Otsu, Japan). The conditions for PCR were as follows: in a 50-μl reaction, 0.15 mm each primer, each dNTP at 2.5 mm, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Takara Shyzo). Primers used were as follows: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: sense, 5′-CCTTCATTGACCTCAACTAC-3′ and antisense, 5′-AGTGATGGCATGGACTGTGGT-3′; BCL-2: sense, 5′-CATTTCCACGTCAACAGAATTG-3′ and antisense, 5′-AGCACAGGATTGGATATTCCAT-3′; BCL-XL: sense, 5′-TTGGACAATGGACTGGTTGA-3′ and antisense, 5′-GTAGAGTGGATGGTCAGTG-3′; MCL-1: sense, 5′-GAGGAGGAGGACGAGTTGTA-3′ and antisense, 5′-CAGCTTTCTTGGTTTATGGT-3′; BAX: sense, 5′-AAGAAGCTGAGCGAGTGTC-3′ and antisense, 5′-CGGCCCCAGTTGAAGTTGC-3′. Reactions were incubated in a PerkinElmer DNA thermal cycler for 25 cycles (with each cycle consisting of denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 30 s at 60 °C, and extension for 60 s at 72 °C) (5Hashimoto S.I. Komuro I. Yamada M. Akagawa K.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3619-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Statistical Analyses—Statistical analyses of the data were performed using Student's t-test. p values <0.01 were considered significant. The results shown are representative of three to seven independent experiments.RESULTSRequirement for Continuous Presence of CSF for the Survival of M-MΦ, but not of GM-MΦ and A-MΦ—M-MΦ, GM-MΦ, and A-MΦ were cultured with or without CSF, and then cell viability was determined. M-CSF withdrawal from M-MΦ induced cell death in a time-dependent manner; ∼60% of the cells died by 2 days and almost all of the cells died by 8 days (Fig. 1A). In contrast, GM-CSF withdrawal from GM-MΦ or A-MΦ did not induce cell death significantly during the culture period (Fig. 1A). M-MΦ cultured in the absence of M-CSF changed from spindle shaped to round and then detached from the dish and floated, with a shrunken cytosol and nucleus and with chromatin condensation and apoptotic vacuoles without microvilli (Fig. 1B). No such morphological change was observed in M-MΦ cultured with M-CSF or in GM-MΦ cultured with or without GM-CSF (Fig. 1B). A typical ladder pattern of internucleosomal DNA cleavage was detected in DNA of M-MΦ cultured for 24 h in the absence of M-CSF, whereas no significant DNA fragmentation was detected in DNA of M-MΦ cultured in the presence of M-CSF or that of GM-MΦ cultured in the presence or absence of GM-CSF (Fig. 1C). Apoptosis and DNA fragmentation of A-MΦ were similar to those of GM-MΦ (data not shown). These findings suggest that M-CSF withdrawal from M-MΦ induces apoptosis but both GM-MΦ and A-MΦ can survive in the absence of CSF.Different Expression of BCL-2 and BCL-XL Genes in M-MΦ, GM-MΦ, and A-MΦ and the Opposite Effect of CSF on Expression—BCL-2 family genes play important roles in the apoptosis of many types of cells (10Shankaranarayanan P.

We therefore examined the expression of BCL-2 family genes and the effect of CSF on their expression in M-MΦ and GM-MΦ by RT-PCR. In M-MΦ, the transcript of the BCL-2 gene was stronger than that of the BCL-XL gene, and M-CSF withdrawal decreased the expression of the BCL-2 gene but induced a slight decrease in the expression of the BCL-XL gene (Fig. 2A). In contrast to M-MΦ, GM-MΦ expressed strongly the BCL-XL gene but weakly the BCL-2 gene, and GM-CSF withdrawal had no significant effect on the expression of these two genes (Fig. 2A). In contrast to BCL-2 and BCL-XL, the transcriptional levels of the MCL-1 and BAX genes were not significantly different between M-MΦ and GM-MΦ and were not affected by CSF deprivation (Fig. 2A). In accordance with the gene expression, the expression of the BCL-2 protein was higher in M-MΦ compared with GM-MΦ and M-CSF withdrawal decreased the expression of BCL-2 protein in M-MΦ (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the expression of the BCL-XL protein was higher in GM-MΦ than in M-MΦ, but GM-CSF withdrawal had no significant effect on the expression of BCL-XL protein in GM-MΦ (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Effects of CSF and catalase on the levels of protein and mRNA expression of BCL-2 family genes in monocyte-derived MΦ and A-MΦ. A, RT-PCR analysis of mRNA levels of BCL-2 family genes and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene in total RNA preparations (200 ng/lane) from these MΦs at 3 h of cultivation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” M-MΦ and GM-MΦ were cultured in medium with or without CSF or supplemented with catalase.

To investigate this possibility, the conditioned medium (CM) obtained from these MΦ cultured for 48 h without CSF was used to examine its effect on the survival of M-CSF-withdrawn M-MΦ. CM of GM-MΦ or A-MΦ, but not of M-MΦ, prevented cell death of M-CSF-depleted M-MΦ (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Effect of endogenously produced or exogenously added catalase on the survival of M-MΦ and GM-MΦ. A, M-MΦ were cultured for 48 h in the medium with M-CSF, medium containing the indicated concentrations of catalase, or 100% of conditioned medium (CM) obtained from M-MΦ, GM-MΦ, or A-MΦ. GM-MΦ were used as the control. Cell number and viability of MΦ were assessed as described in Fig. 1. Values are expressed as the means of triplicate cultures ± S.D.

Values are expressed as the means of triplicate cultures ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A previous study showed that human CEM T cells can survive in serum-free medium supplemented with a low level of extracellular catalase (21Sandstrom P.A. Buttke T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4708-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether extracellular catalase prevents apoptosis in M-CSF-withdrawn M-MΦ and stimulates the expression of both BCL-2 gene and protein. Addition of HEC prevented M-CSF-withdrawn M-MΦ from undergoing cell death in a dose-dependent manner, and 10 units/ml of HEC completely rescued the cells from apoptosis. Addition of 10 units/ml HEC to GM-CSF-withdrawn GM-MΦ had no such effect (Fig. 3A).Then we examined the effect of anti-HEC antibody (anti-Cat Ab) on the activity of the CM of GM-MΦ. Pretreatment of the CM with anti-Cat Ab, but not with control IgG, completely abrogated the ability to rescue the cell death of M-CSF-withdrawn M-MΦ (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained in experiments using the CM of A-MΦ (data not shown).Next, we examined the role of catalase in the expression of BCL-2 family genes in M-CSF-withdrawn M-MΦ. Addition of catalase to M-CSF-withdrawn M-MΦ restored the expression of BCL-2 but did not affect the gene expression of BCL-XL, MCL-1, or BAX (Fig. 2A). Addition of catalase did not significantly change the gene and protein expression of BCL-2 family genes in GM-CSF-withdrawn GM-MΦ (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the active molecule in the CM of GM-MΦ and A-MΦ that can rescue the survival of M-CSF-withdrawn M-MΦ via restoration of BCL-2 expression is catalase.Anti-catalase Antibody Abolished the Expression of BCL-2 in M-MΦ Cultured with M-CSF and BCL-XL in GM-MΦ or A-MΦ Cultured with or without GM-CSF and Induced Apoptosis of These MΦs—The above results indicate that catalase can stimulate the expression of BCL-2 and rescue the survival of M-CSF-withdrawn M-MΦ. Therefore we next examined whether extracellular catalase also plays a critical role in the CSF-dependent survival of M-MΦ and in the survival of GM-MΦ and A-MΦ. Addition of anti-Cat Ab suppressed the expression of BCL-2 protein in M-MΦ cultured in the presence of M-CSF and of BCL-XL protein in both GM-MΦ and A-MΦ cultured without GM-CSF (Fig. 2B). In accordance with these data, addition of anti-Cat Ab induced cell death of M-MΦ cultured with M-CSF and GM-MΦ cultured with or without GM-CSF, and addition of control IgG had no effect on the cell viability of these MΦs (Fig. 3C). The cell death of these MΦ induced by anti-Cat Ab was due to apoptosis, as indicated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling staining (data not shown).GM-MΦ and A-MΦ, but Not M-MΦ, Can Produce Enough Levels of Extracellular Catalase in the Absence of CSF—The above results sugge"
https://openalex.org/W2134115318,"Transcription of hepatic L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) gene is cell type-specific and is under the control of various nutritional conditions. The L-PK gene contains multiple cis-regulatory elements located within a 170-bp upstream region necessary for these regulations. These elements can synergistically stimulate L-PK gene transcription, although their mechanisms are largely unknown. Because nuclear factor (NF) 1 family members bind to specific cis-regulatory elements known as L-IIA and L-IIB and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1α binds to the adjacent element L-I, we examined the functional and physical interactions between these two transcription factors. Reporter gene assay showed that these two factors synergistically activated the L-PK promoter containing the 5′-flanking region up to –189. Although two NF1-binding sites are required for the maximum synergistic effect of NF1 family members with HNF1α, significant functional interaction between the two factors was observed in the L-PK promoter containing two mutated NF1-binding sites and also in the promoter containing only the HNF1α-binding site, raising the possibility that NF1 proteins function as HNF1α co-activators. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that both NF1 proteins and HNF1α bound to the promoter region of the L-PK gene in vivo. In vitro binding assay confirmed that NF1 proteins directly interacted mainly with the homeodomain of HNF1α via their DNA-binding domains. This interaction enhanced HNF1α binding to the L-I element and was also observed in rat liver by co-immunoprecipitation assay. Thus, we conclude that cooperative interaction between NF1 family members and HNF1α plays an important role in hepatic L-PK transcription.

Four PK isozymes are known to exist in mammals and are designated as L, R, M1, and M2 types (1Yamada K. Noguchi T. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). They are produced from two genes, PKL and PKM, by alternative use of two promoters and mutually exclusive alternative splicing, respectively (2Noguchi T. Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13807-13812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Takenaka M. Noguchi T. Inoue H. Yamada K. Matsuda T. Tanaka T. J. Biol.

The L-type isozyme (L-PK) is expressed in a tissue-specific manner; this form is expressed primarily in hepatic parenchymal cells and is also present in pancreatic β cells, kidney, and small intestine (1Yamada K. Noguchi T. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Hepatic L-PK gene expression is also transcriptionally controlled positively by glucose in the presence of insulin and negatively by polyunsaturated fatty acids or glucagon via cyclic AMP (5Noguchi T. Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14393-14397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Decaux J.F. Antoine B. Kahn A. J. Biol.

These regulations of the L-PK gene transcription are mediated via the multiple cis-regulatory elements located within a 170-bp upstream region from the transcription start site, as shown in Fig. 1 (8Liimatta M. Towle H.C. Clarke S. Jump D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1147-1153PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yamada K. Noguchi T. Matsuda T. Takenaka M. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Tanaka T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1989; 209: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We have named these elements L-I (–94 to –76), L-II (–149 to –126), and L-III (–170 to –150) (9Yamada K. Noguchi T. Matsuda T. Takenaka M. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19885-19891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, another group has identified a weak negative element (–116 to –99) between L-I and L-II (10Vaulont S. Puzenat N. Levrat F. Cognet M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although this element has been named L2, we will refer to this as L-IIA and L-II as L-IIB hereafter. Although L-IIB is considered to be a regulatory element responsible for polyunsaturated fatty acid suppression of L-PK gene transcription (8Liimatta M. Towle H.C. Clarke S. Jump D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1147-1153PubMed Google Scholar), L-III itself possesses carbohydrate responsiveness and is thus termed a carbohydrate response element (11Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13222-13228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bergot M.-O. Diaz-Guerra M.M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the natural promoter context, however, L-III alone does not confer carbohydrate responsiveness to the promoter, and synergistic interaction between L-IIB and L-III is crucial for carbohydrate responsiveness (13Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12787-12795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, L-IIB also functions as an accessory element for L-III. We have observed functional interactions between L-I and L-IIB, L-IIB and L-III, but not L-I and L-III (9Yamada K. Noguchi T. Matsuda T. Takenaka M. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19885-19891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inclusion of all three elements oriented in the same direction showed the maximum synergistic effect, indicating that these elements function as a unit. This unit possesses cell type specificity as well as carbohydrate responsiveness in vivo (15Cuif M.-H. Porteu A. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13769-13772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Noguchi T. Okabe M. Wang Z. Yamada K. Imai E. Tanaka T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the transcription factors that bind to these elements may interact with each other, and these interactions may be crucial to the further understanding of L-PK gene transcriptional regulation.It has been shown that hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1α binds to L-I (9Yamada K.

Although several transcription factors are reported to interact with the L-III element (10Vaulont S. Puzenat N. Levrat F. Cognet M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. J. Mol.

Takenoshita M. Sakurai M. Bruik R.K. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Arnot D. Uyeda K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9116-9121Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 21Iizuka K.

It has been widely accepted that HNF4α is involved in transcriptional activation of the L-PK gene, because reporter gene assays and binding assays showed that HNF4α stimulates the L-PK promoter activity by binding to the L-IIB element (10Vaulont S. Puzenat N. Levrat F. Cognet M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7725-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, we suspected an alternative mechanism, because NF1 family members also bind to the L-IIB element as well as the accessory element in the S14 gene, whereas HNF4α does not bind to this element in the S14 gene (25Yamada K. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The S14 accessory element located in the adjacent region to carbohydrate response element is involved in carbohydrate responsiveness of the S14 gene and therefore corresponds to L-IIB in the L-PK gene (14Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of HNF4α and L-PK genes in the liver are regulated by hormones and diet in opposite ways (26Oyadomari S. Matsuno F. Chowdhury S. Kimura T. Iwase K. Araki E. Shichiri M. Mori M. Takiguchi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). However, functional significance of NF1 family members in the L-PK gene regulation has never been clarified. We assumed that NF1 family proteins play important roles in transcriptional regulation of the L-PK gene by interactions with HNF1α and ChREBP.HNF1α (also called LF-B1) is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor expressed in liver, kidney, pancreatic β cells, and small intestine (28Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 29Schrem H. Klempnauer J. Borlak J. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 129-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). HNF1α is implicated in hepatocyte differentiation and is required for liver-specific expression of several genes, including albumin, β-fibrinogen, and other genes for homeostasis and metabolisms of glucose, lipids, steroids, and amino acids. HNF1α consists of 628 amino acids and contains three functional domains, an N-terminal dimerization domain, a DNA-binding domain (a Pit1-Oct1-Unc86-like domain and an atypical homeodomain), and a C-terminal transactivation domain.NF1 family proteins are ubiquitously expressed and regulate, not only ubiquitously expressed genes, but also hormonally and developmentally regulated genes (30Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 31Osada S. Matsubara T. Daimon S. Terazu Y. Xu M. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). There are four NF1 genes in mammals, NF1-A, -B, -C, and -X, from which numerous NF1 isoforms are generated through alternative splicing or promoter usage. NF1 proteins are highly conserved in the N-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization domains, whereas the C termini contain diverse transactivation/repression domains.In this study, we focused our research on the role of NF1 family members in transcriptional regulation of the L-PK gene. We examined functional and physical interaction between HNF1α and NF1 family proteins that bind to adjacent regions of the L-PK promoter and found that cooperative interaction between HNF1α and NF1 family proteins plays an important role in L-PK transcription in the liver.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The dye terminator cycle sequencing kit was obtained from PE Applied Biosystems. The dual luciferase reporter gene assay kit, pGL3-Basic, pRL-SV40, and the T7 TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system were purchased from Promega.

Plasmid pSPORT 1 and Wako PURE system, an in vitro transcription/translation system, were obtained from Invitrogen and Wako, respectively.Animals and Treatment—6–8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley and Wister rats were used. To examine the effect of a high carbohydrate diet, rats were starved for 24 or 48 h and were then refed with a high carbohydrate diet containing 61% dextrin and 20% sucrose (5Noguchi T. Inoue H. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14393-14397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee, Nagoya University, and rats were treated in accordance with the guidelines.Plasmids—Reporter plasmids pLluc189 and pLluc62 were generated by ligating promoter fragments of the L-PK gene isolated from pLcat189 and pLcat 62 (9Yamada K. Noguchi T. Matsuda T. Takenaka M. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Tanaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19885-19891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into pGL3-Basic vector, respectively. Reporter plasmid p(LI)2luc62 was produced by insertion of two copies of L-I oligonucleotide (–94 to –76) into the XbaI site of pLluc62. HNF1α expression plasmid pRSV-HNF1α was generously provided by Drs. P. Monaci and A. Nicosia (Instituto di Ricerche di Biologia Moleculare, Rome, Italy). To construct pRSV-NF1 expression plasmids, cDNAs of NF1 family members were isolated from corresponding cDNA clones in pBluescript (31Osada S. Matsubara T. Daimon S. Terazu Y. Xu M. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) using appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into pGM4 vector (25Yamada K. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. Biochem.

NF1-C cDNA was isolated from the above cDNA clone by digestion with SalI and XhoI and ligated into the SalI/XhoI sites of pSPORT 1. The resultant plasmid was then digested with SalI and HindIII, and the cDNA was isolated and inserted into the SalI/HindIII sites of pQE-30 to produce pQE-NF1-C. HNF1α expression plasmid in Escherichia coli, pT7-B1, was described previously (9Yamada K. Noguchi T. Matsuda T. Takenaka M. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Tanaka T. J. Biol.

Plasmids expressing glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of NF1 family members or HNF1α were constructed as follows. cDNA fragments encoding complete coding sequences of NF1 family members were isolated from the above cDNA clones by digestion with SalI/NotI and were then inserted into the SalI/NotI sites of pGEX-5X-1.

The resultant supernatant was used for EMSAs. HNF1α and NF1-C were synthesized in vitro from pT7-B1 using the T7 TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system and from pT7-NF1-C using the Wako PURE system, respectively, and both were also used for EMSAs. The oligonucleotides used in EMSAs are listed in TABLE ONE. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. 10 μg of nuclear extract were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the 32P-labeled probe in a reaction mixture containing 12.5 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). When in vitro synthesized HNF1α and NF1-C were used for EMSAs, the reaction mixture contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg of sonicated single-stranded DNA, and the 32P-labeled probe. Competition experiments included a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides. Supershift assays were carried out by preincubating the nuclear extract with anti-NF1 antibody or anti-HNF1α antibody (34Miura N. Iwai K. Miyamoto I. Eur. J.

Polyclonal anti-NF1 antibody 8199 was kindly provided by Dr. Naoko Tanese (New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY). After the binding reaction, the mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 200 V for 1 h.

Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were treated with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 15 min. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. After being washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were suspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 1% SDS and 10 mm EDTA. The lysate was sonicated to generate DNA fragments with a length of <1,000 bp. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 10-fold with buffer containing 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl and then precleared for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose in the presence of normal rabbit IgG and 2 μg of sonicated denatured DNA to reduce the nonspecific background. The supernatant was incubated with normal rabbit IgG, anti-NF1 antibody or anti-HNF1α antibody, or without any antibody overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The reaction mixture was centrifuged, and protein A-Sepharose was washed extensively. DNA was eluted from the precipitate, reverse cross-linked by incubating at 65 °C for 6 h, and then treated by proteinase K. The purified DNA was dissolved in water and analyzed by PCR using primer sets for the promoter region (–246 to –23, 5′-TACAGACCTGATCTGAGCCTTTG-3′ and 5′-TTTATACTGCGCCTTTGTCAGTG-3′) and exon 12 (5′-GCTCTGGCTATACCAACATCATGC-3′ and 5′-CGGATTGAGACAGGGATATACAAC-3′) of the L-PK gene. The input sample contained 1/250 of the supernatant used for immunoprecipitation. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.Western Blotting—The proteins were separated by electrophoresis using 9 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by transfer to membranes. The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the antibodies indicated in Figs. 8 and 9 and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 before being probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies. Blots were developed using ECL plus reagent and exposed to Hyperfilm, according to the manufacturer's protocols.FIGURE 8Identification of the region of HNF1α interacted with NF1-C.

https://openalex.org/W2063005932,"During translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli, glucose is phosphorylated by phospho-IIAGlc and Enzyme IICBGlc, the last two proteins in the phosphotransfer sequence of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system. Transient state (rapid quench) methods were used to determine the second order rate constants that describe the phosphotransfer reactions (phospho-IIAGlc to IICBGlc to Glc) and also the second order rate constants for the transfer from phospho-IIAGlc to molecularly cloned IIBGlc, the soluble, cytoplasmic domain of IICBGlc. The rate constants for the forward and reverse phosphotransfer reactions between IIAGlc and IICBGlc were 3.9 × 106 and 0.31 × 106 m–1 s–1, respectively, and the rate constant for the physiologically irreversible reaction between [P]IICBGlc and Glc was 3.2 × 106 m–1 s–1. From the rate constants, the equilibrium constants for the transfer of the phospho-group from His90 of [P]IIAGlc to the phosphorylation site Cys of IIBGlc or IICBGlc were found to be 3.5 and 12, respectively. These equilibrium constants signify that the thiophospho-group in these proteins has a high phosphotransfer potential, similar to that of the phosphohistidinyl phosphotransferase system proteins. In these studies, preparations of IICBGlc were invariably found to contain endogenous, firmly bound Glc (estimated K′D ∼10–7 m). The bound Glc was kinetically competent and was rapidly phosphorylated, indicating that IICBGlc has a random order, Bi Bi, substituted enzyme mechanism. The equilibrium constant for the binding of Glc was deduced from differences in the statistical goodness of fit of the phosphotransfer data to the kinetic model.

Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 2Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Robillard G.T. Broos J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 73-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Siebold C. Flukiger K. Beutler R. Erni B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The PTS has several important functions in eubacterial cell physiology in addition to its major role in sugar transport, especially in Gram-positive bacteria (5Hu K.Y. Saier Jr., M.H. Res. Microbiol. 2002; 153: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).When the PTS catalyzes sugar transport, the sugar is phosphorylated as it crosses the membrane, and this process requires 3–6 proteins, depending on the sugar. One example is the Glc transport system in enteric bacteria, shown in Fig. 1.The first two proteins, Enzyme I and HPr, are the so-called general proteins of the system, meaning that they are not sugar-specific. The second pair of proteins, IIAGlc and IICBGlc, are the sugar-specific components. In other cases, the sugar-specific proteins vary from one to four separately encoded proteins. All of the phosphotransfer reactions except the last step (transfer to the sugar) are physiologically reversible. A second point is that the phosphorylation site residues in the PTS proteins are generally His, but in a number of the membrane proteins, the phosphorylation site can be a Cys residue. The phosphoryl group is transferred from PEP through a chain of His proteins to the membrane Enzyme II, where the phosphorylation site can be a His or a Cys (as it is in IICBGlc), and finally to the sugar. In IICBGlc, the B domain extends into the cytoplasm and contains the phosphorylation site Cys.Our long term goal is to be able to predict the kinetics of Glc uptake by intact cells, and for this purpose it is necessary to obtain the rate constants for each of the reactions in Fig. 1. We established the basic methodology by developing a rapid quench method for determining the rate constants for the reversible phosphotransfer from phospho-HPr to IIAGlc (6Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the technique has now been applied to the other reactions shown in Fig. 1. The B and C domains of IICBGlc have been genetically cloned by Buhr et al. (7Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and kinetic results with the B domain, called IIBGlc, and with intact IICBGlc are reported below.We address two other questions. First, several of the integral membrane sugar transporters, when unphosphorylated, have been shown to bind their sugar substrates (3Robillard G.T. Broos J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 73-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Siebold C. Flukiger K. Beutler R. Erni B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and this bound sugar can be phosphorylated, but the rate has never been measured. In the present case, it was essential to quantify and characterize the bound sugar, Glc, for accurate determination of the kinetic constants. Second, we have obtained, for the first time, the apparent equilibrium constants for the phosphotransfer reactions between the His residue in IIAGlc and the Cys residue in domain IIB, from which the phosphotransfer potential of a phospho-S-Cys protein can be derived. Whereas the phospho-S-Cys structure is relatively rare, it is also found in the protein-tyrosine phosphatases of eukaryotic cells (8Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All materials used for the assay of Glc are given in supplemental data. l-α-Dioleoylphosphatidyl-dl-glycerol (P-9664; Sigma); N-lauroylsarcosine (L-5777; Sigma); adenosine 5′-[γ-32P]triphosphate (110 TBq/m mol) (PB10168; Amersham Biosciences); and d-[6-3H]glucose (1.9 TBq/mmol) (NET 100C; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were purchased from the indicated sources. All buffer salts and other reagents were of a purity typical for research reagents from standard commercial sources. The pH of all buffers is reported at the temperature and concentration at which they were used.Assays for Glc and for the Binding of Glc to Escherichia coli Membranes—Supplemental data describe the four methods used to characterize the Glc found “contaminating” both highly purified IICBGlc and membrane suspensions and for measuring the binding of Glc to these membranes. These are described in detail in supplemental data. For the routine assay of Glc in membrane suspensions being prepared for rapid quench experiments, two sources of data were used. The first was the hexokinase assay using adenosine 5′-[γ-32P]triphosphate described in supplemental data. The second was the actual experimental results of the rapid quench assay when conducted with a stoichiometric excess of the phosphodonor, [32P]IIAGlc. 4For the proteins listed in Footnote 3, the prefix [P]or[32P] denotes the P-phosphoprotein or 32P-phosphoprotein, respectively. The quantity of Glc measured by the two methods was similar.Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Media—All strains were grown on Luria-Bertani broth containing the required antibiotics and inducers. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (F– ompT hsdSB (r –B m –B) gal dcm (DE3)) (Novagen) was used as the host for plasmid pJBH, which encodes the IIBGlc-His6 gene fragment (a generous gift of Prof. B. Erni, University of Basel) and was grown as described (7Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strain ZSC112ΔG (ΔptsG::cat manZ glk) from which the chromosomal gene for IICBGlc was deleted (7Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the host for plasmid pTGH11 (encoding IICBGlc-His6) (both also gifts from B. Erni) for the preparation of membranes and for the purification of IICBGlc-His6. E. coli strain ZSC112ΔG was also used as the host for plasmid pCB30 (encoding wild type IICBGlc) (9Bouma C.L. Meadow N.D. Stover E.W. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) for the preparation of membranes.Preparation of Washed Membranes—Cultures of 3 liters, at an A600 of 0.6–1.0, were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 50 mm Tris/Cl– buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm KCl, and finally resuspended in this solution in a volume equal to 1% of that of the original culture. To discharge phospho-groups from the PTS proteins, 10 mm methyl α-glucoside and 10 mm KF were added to the final cell suspension, which was incubated at room temperature for 15 min (10Pelton J.G. Torchia D.A. Meadow N.D. Wong C.-Y. Roseman S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10043-10057Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and then frozen at –80 °C. After thawing, the cells were homogenized by two passages through a French pressure cell (Spectronic Instruments) at 110 megapascals, the homogenate was centrifuged at 5,600 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 370,000 × g for 2 h. The particulate fraction was resuspended in 10 mm Tris/glycine buffer (pH 8.9), 1 mm dithiothreitol (11Waeber U. Buhr A. Schunk T. Erni B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) to the original volume of the homogenate and centrifuged again; the high speed centrifugation was repeated a third time unless otherwise indicated. The membranes were resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer per g of original wet weight of cells and frozen in aliquots at –80 °C.The final membrane preparations contained variable quantities of Glc, and its concentration increased slowly upon storage or incubation and during the 1–3 h required to complete a rapid quench experiment (supplemental data). Whereas the source of Glc was not identified, a procedure was developed that eliminated the increase in Glc concentration but did not significantly affect the activity of the enzyme, reducing it by less than 20% as determined by PTS sugar phosphorylation assays. The method was to incubate the preparation in a dialysis cassette (Pierce Slide-A-Lyzer) versus Tris/glycine buffer, pH 8.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol or 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% sodium azide at 37 °C for 15 h and continued for several hours at 4 °C.Kinetic Properties of Endogenous Glc in Membrane Preparations—The concentration of endogenous Glc after treating the membrane preparations as described above was variable but was always in the same range as the concentration of IICBGlc. Modeling the kinetics of Reactions V, VI, and VII (Fig. 2, Scheme I) required an understanding of the kinetic properties of this pool of endogenous Glc as well as decisions about how to model the kinetics of Reactions V(t), VI(t), and VII(t) when [3H]Glc was added to the syringe containing the solution of [32P]IIAGlc. These methods are described in supplemental data on kinetics.FIGURE 2Phosphotransfer from [P]IIAGlc to Glc and the random order of addition mechanism for IICBGlc. The upper panel shows the proposed catalytic mechanism of IICBGlc; it is a Bi Bi, random order of addition, substituted enzyme mechanism. The lower panel shows the scheme of balanced first and second order equations for the reactions of the Bi Bi, random order mechanism, except Reaction IVa, which applies only to the IIBGlc domain. The rate constants of the reactions (kXXX) are determined (using the kinetic simulator, Kinsim) by numerical integration of the differential equations defined by the chemical reactions. The signs of the rate constants (kXXX) are positive for reactions proceeding left to right. Reactions pertaining to [3H]Glc are identified by a t. These data are treated as separate reactions in the model, because the appearance of [3H]Glc-6-[32P] was a separate data set, independent of the data on the appearance of total Glc-6-[32P]. In modeling with the simulator, these constants were held equal to the corresponding constants for unlabeled Glc; therefore, they are not given in the tables or figures. Rate constants that are omitted were assigned values of 0 in the simulator because of their low thermodynamic reversibility. In this work, Reactions IV and V are referred to as the “upper pathway,” and Reactions VI and VII are referred to as the “lower pathway.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SCHEME 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)General Methods—Assays for the PTS proteins by measuring the rate of sugar phosphorylation were performed as described (9Bouma C.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was used for IIAGlc and for membrane proteins.The concentration of HPr or IIAGlc was measured by using the lactate dehydrogenase coupled assay (12Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) (using homogenous auxiliary proteins), which measures the quantity of protein that can accept a phospho-group from PEP. The concentrations of HPr or IIAGlc estimated from the specific activity of the [32P]PEP agreed with the results of the lactate dehydrogenase assay within 5%.IIBGlc was quantified by three methods: (a) by solutions of the protein, purified to apparent homogeneity, were thoroughly dialyzed and analyzed for nitrogen by the method of Jaenicke (15Jaenicke L. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 61: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); (b) quantitative phosphorylation of the protein using an excess of [32P]PEP (of accurately known specific activity) and catalytic quantities of Enzyme I, HPr, and IIAGlc; (c) by the lactate dehydrogenase assay (12Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). When all three methods were applied to the same sample, the results agreed to within 10%.IICBGlc, both purified and in membranes, was quantified by two methods. (a) The sample was assayed for its activity in PEP driven sugar phosphorylation, using a range of concentrations of IIAGlc. These data were used to calculate the Vmax, which was converted to the concentration of the IICBGlc protein by using the specific activity of the homogenous enzyme (97 μmol of sugar phosphate/min/mg of IICBGlc) (9Bouma C.L. Meadow N.D. Stover E.W. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). (b) IICBGlc was also quantified by quantitatively labeling the protein in membrane suspensions with [32P]PEP of accurately known specific activity (1–3 TBq/mol) (6Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) as follows. A mixture of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 25 nmol of [32 P]PEP, 10 pmol of enzyme I, 7 pmol of HPr, 15 pmol of IIAGlc, and ∼150 pmol of IICBGlc in a volume of 100 μl was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. It was then quenched with 50 μl of 0.6 m KOH and analyzed by gel filtration chromatography by the same methods used for rapid quench samples (see below). When applied to three membrane preparations, the two methods agreed to within 15%. Membranes prepared from ZSC112ΔG exhibited insignificant activity in the PEP-driven sugar phosphorylation assay as well as insignificant labeling with [32P]PEP.Purification of Proteins—Enzyme I, HPr, and IIAGlc were separately overproduced in cells carrying the relevant plasmids. The proteins were purified by the methods used previously (6Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). IIBGlc-His6 was purified by the method of Buhr et al. (7Buhr A. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23437-23443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) was substituted for Sephadex G75. The final preparations were apparently homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE. IICBGlc-His6 was purified using modifications of the method of Waeber et al. (11Waeber U. Buhr A. Schunk T. Erni B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column was used, but neither Glc nor methyl α-d-glucopyranoside was added to solutions. Before being employed in either rapid quench experiments or in the PTS sugar phosphorylation assay, the IICBGlc was activated, except as noted, by mixing with an equal volume of a solution of lipid/detergent mixed micelles (5 mg/ml dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol, 1 mg/ml sodium lauroyl sarcosinate), as described by Bouma et al. (9Bouma C.L. Meadow N.D. Stover E.W. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Synthesis of [32P]PEP—The enzymatic synthesis (16Roossien F.F. Brink J. Robillard G.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 760: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) was performed with the modifications described previously (6Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The purification by anion exchange chromatography was further modified by the substitution of KCl for triethylamine/H2CO3 as the eluant. We suspect that triethylamine or a contaminant in it occasionally interferes with the phosphotransfer reactions (data not shown). To stop the enzymatic reaction, 25 μl of 20% (v/v) Norite A suspension was added to the reaction mixture. The Bio-Rad AG1-x8 column was equilibrated with 10 mm BisTris/Cl, pH 6.0, which was also a component of all of the eluant solutions. The reaction mixture (including the Norite A) was placed onto the column, which was then washed with 5 ml of the buffer, and the Pi was eluted with 5 ml of 0.1 m KCl. The PEP was eluted with 0.3 m KCl; 0.5-ml fractions were collected in tubes containing 40 μl of 0.2 m Na3PO4, 0.2 m K2PO4 and counted by liquid scintillation counting. The peak concentration of [32P]PEP appeared in fractions 5–10. Prepared by this method and stored at 4 °C, the PEP had a spontaneous rate of hydrolysis at 4 °C of 0.4% per day.Preparation of [32P]HPr, [32P]IIAGlc, [32P]IIBGlc, and [32P] IICBGlc—[32P]HPr and [32P]IIAGlc were prepared as described previously (6Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). [32P]IIBGlc was prepared under the conditions used for the preparation of [32P]IIAGlc, using a molar ratio of HPr/IIAGlc/IIBGlc = 1:24:24. A Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) was employed to fractionate the proteins.[32P]IICBGlc was prepared from purified protein, which was sonicated for 30 s in a bath type sonicator in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of [32P]IIAGlc and incubated for 15 min (with no added phospholipid). The proteins were separated on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column.The columns used to fractionate the phosphorylation mixtures were equilibrated with 20 mm carbonate/bicarbonate (pH 9.5) buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The specific activity of all four phosphoproteins ranged from 10 to 40 TBq/mol, with emphasis on the accuracy of the specific activity of the [32P]PEP (6Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Stability of [32P]IIBGlc and [32P]IICBGlc under Quench Conditions—[32P]IIBGlc and [32P]IICBGlc were isolated as described and stored at –80 °C in 20 mm carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5). Tests of the effect of pH on the rate of hydrolysis of the phospho-group were made by diluting 10 μl of 0.5 μm [32P]IIBGlc solution into 3.5 ml of buffer or diluting 100 μl of 0.33 μm [32P]IICBGlc into 4.0 ml of buffer. All equipment and vessels were pretreated with bovine serum albumin to minimize adsorption of protein. The buffers were as follows: pH 2, 0.1 m HCl/KCl; pH 3.8, 50 mm citric acid/sodium citrate; pH 6.0 and pH 8.1, 50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4; pH 10.1, 50 mm Na2CO3/NaHCO3; pH 12, 25 mm Na3PO4; pH 13, 0.1 m NaOH; pH 14, 1 m NaOH; and pH 14.3, 2 m NaOH (the last three solutions were prepared from fresh, commercial 2 m NaOH standard solution). The mixtures were incubated at 23 °C for 5 min to 4 h and filtered through 23-mm diameter polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (Millipore Corp.) in a vacuum apparatus that allowed collection of the filtrate; both the filter and the filtrate were counted to ensure quantitative recovery of the radioactivity. Tests of the membrane with [32P]Pi showed that the background was negligible and that washing of the filter was not required. Other controls showed that protein adsorption to the membranes was quantitative.The high rate of hydrolysis above pH 13 (see “Results”) made use of a quench solution containing 1 m KOH unsuitable for the phosphotransfer measurements involving IIBGlc, especially since heating of the quenched reaction is required to fully denature [32P]IIAGlc (6Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The conditions for quenching that were developed for maintaining the phospho-S-Cys bond intact were as follows: 0.1 m KOH, 3 m urea, and heating for 5 min at 55 °C. These conditions yield a level of hydrolysis sufficiently low (less than 1% per min) to allow preparation (with careful timing) of the quenched samples for separation by gel filtration (where the rate of hydrolysis is negligible).We unexpectedly found that IICBGlc is rapidly fragmented when heated under the conditions developed for the chromatography of [32P]IIBGlc. When heated to 55 °C for 5 min in 0.1 m KOH, 3 m urea quench solution, as much as 65% of the radioactivity in [32P]IICBGlc or [32P]IICBGlc-His6 appears in fractions containing 10–20-kDa molecules. These fractions also contain the six histidine residues from IICBGlc-His6, as shown by using dot blots treated with anti-His antibodies (data not shown); corresponding fractions from control membranes do not bind the anti-His antibodies. Urea (3 m) enhances the rate of fragmentation by about 30%. These results suggest that a peptide bond somewhere in the linker region between the B and C domains is very labile at high pH. Optimal conditions for attaining rapid quenching while minimizing protein cleavage and hydrolysis of the phospho-group were found to be 0.2 m KOH (final concentration in the quenched reaction) with no heating before injection onto the gel filtration column. Careful timing between thawing the quenched samples and injection produced a reproducible 13 ± 3% fragmentation, with acceptable speed of quenching of the reaction. The raw data for the concentration of the phosphoproteins in quenched reactions was therefore corrected by 13%.Rapid Quench Assays—The present study employed the rapid quench apparatus used previously, and all of the details for its set-up were the same (6Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of 32P-labeled proteins were diluted with the same solution used to fractionate the phosphorylation mixture at the time of its preparation (see above). Stock solutions of IIBGlc or membrane suspensions were diluted with 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The phosphate buffer was pH 7.5 (rather than pH 6.5 (6Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)) to correlate with work on the kinetics of Enzymes II published by the time the present work was started (e.g. see Refs. 17Lolkema J.S. ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17844-17849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 18Garcia-Alles L.F. Zahn A. Erni B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10086Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The rate of phosphotransfer between HPr and IIAGlc is not significantly affected by a change in pH from 6.5 to 7.5 (6Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 5N. D. Meadow, R. S. Savtchenko, S. J. Remington, and S. Roseman, unpublished data. Another significant modification (described above) was of the conditions used for quenching the reactions. Preparation of the solutions for rapid quench experiments required large dilutions from stock solutions and a change from the frozen state to ambient temperature (∼23 °C), at which all experiments were performed. The diluted solutions were therefore preincubated for 1 h at ambient temperature before the experiment was started.When the phosphotransfer between IIAGlc and IIBGlc was studied, a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (6Meadow N.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33440-33445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was used to separate the proteins in the quenched reactions. When the phosphotransfer reactions between IIAGlc and IICBGlc were studied, the column was a Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences). This column cannot resolve Glc-6-P from inorganic phosphate, which is always present because of hydrolysis of the phosphodonor protein during storage following its preparation. For this purpose, a separate aliquot of each quenched reaction mixture was chromatographed on a Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) that was equilibrated with 35 mm Na3PO4, 0.1 m Na2SO4.When [3H]Glc was used in rapid quench experiments, the [3H]Glc-6-P was isolated by anion exchange"
