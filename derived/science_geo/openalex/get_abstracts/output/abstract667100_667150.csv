https://openalex.org/W3121102891,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Governments are instituting mobile tracking technologies to perform rapid contact tracing. However, these technologies are only effective if the public is willing to use them, implying that their perceived public health benefits must outweigh personal concerns over privacy and security. The Australian federal government recently launched the ‘COVIDSafe’ app, designed to anonymously register nearby contacts. If a contact later identifies as infected with COVID-19, health department officials can rapidly followup with their registered contacts to stop the virus’ spread. The current study assessed attitudes towards three tracking technologies (telecommunication network tracking, a government app, and Apple and Google’s Bluetooth exposure notification system) in two representative samples of the Australian public prior to the launch of COVIDSafe. We compared these attitudes to usage of the COVIDSafe app after its launch in a further two representative samples of the Australian public. Using Bayesian methods, we find widespread acceptance for all tracking technologies, however, observe a large intention-behaviour gap between people’s stated attitudes and actual uptake of the COVIDSafe app. We consider the policy implications of these results for Australia and the world at large."
https://openalex.org/W3122176006,"Amidst the rapid global spread of Covid-19, many governments enforced country-wide lockdowns, with likely severe well-being consequences. In this regard, South Africa is an extreme case suffering from low levels of well-being, but at the same time enforcing very strict lockdown regulations. In this study, we analyse the causal effect of a lockdown and consequently, the determinants of happiness during the aforementioned. A difference-in-difference approach is used to make causal inferences on the lockdown effect on happiness, and an OLS estimation investigates the determinants of happiness after lockdown. The results show that the lockdown had a significant and negative impact on happiness. In analysing the determinants of happiness after lockdown, we found that stay-at-home orders have positively impacted happiness during this period. On the other hand, other lockdown regulations such as a ban on alcohol sales, a fear of becoming unemployed and a greater reliance on social media have negative effects, culminating in a net loss in happiness. Interestingly, Covid-19, proxied by new deaths per day, had an inverted U-shape relationship with happiness. Seemingly people were, at the onset of Covid-19 positive and optimistic about the low fatality rates and the high recovery rates. However, as the pandemic progressed, they became more concerned, and this relationship changed and became negative, with peoples' happiness decreasing as the number of new deaths increased."
https://openalex.org/W3123769934,"Objectives Rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) is a major health problem in patients with liver cirrhosis. The impact of MDRO colonization in liver transplantation (LT) candidates and recipients on mortality has not been determined in detail. Methods Patients consecutively evaluated and listed for LT in a tertiary German liver transplant center from 2008 to 2018 underwent screening for MDRO colonization including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (MDRGN), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). MDRO colonization and infection status were obtained at LT evaluation, planned and unplanned hospitalization, three months upon graft allocation, or at last follow-up on the waiting list. Results In total, 351 patients were listed for LT, of whom 164 (47%) underwent LT after a median of 249 (range 0–1662) days. Incidence of MDRO colonization increased during waiting time for LT, and MRDO colonization was associated with increased mortality on the waiting list (HR = 2.57, p&lt;0.0001. One patients was colonized with a carbapenem-resistant strain at listing, 9 patients acquired carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CRGN) on the waiting list, and 4 more after LT. In total, 10 of these 14 patients died. Conclusions Colonization with MDRO is associated with increased mortality on the waiting list, but not in short-term follow-up after LT. Moreover, colonization with CRGN seems associated with high mortality in liver transplant candidates and recipients."
https://openalex.org/W3122848089,"A fundamental premise of river management is that practitioners understand the resource they are working with. In river management this requires that baseline information is available on the structure, function, health and trajectory of rivers. Such information provides the basis to contextualise, to plan, to be proactive, to prioritise, to set visions, to set goals and to undertake objective, pragmatic, transparent and evidence-based decision making. In this paper we present the State-wide NSW River Styles database, the largest and most comprehensive dataset of geomorphic river type, condition and recovery potential available in Australia. The database is an Open Access product covering over 216,600 km of stream length in an area of 802,000 km 2 . The availability of the database presents unprecedented opportunities to systematically consider river management issues at local, catchment, regional and state-wide scales, and appropriately contextualise applications in relation to programs at other scales (e.g. internationally)–something that cannot be achieved independent from, or without, such a database. We present summary findings from the database and demonstrate through use of examples how the database has been used in geomorphologically-informed river management. We also provide a cautionary note on the limitations of the database and expert advice on lessons learnt during its development to aid others who are undertaking similar analyses."
https://openalex.org/W3122202611,"Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is one of the most important indicators of cell viability. Extracellular ATP (eATP) is commonly detected in cultures of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells but is not the focus of current scientific research. Although ATP release has traditionally been considered to mainly occur as a consequence of cell destruction, current evidence indicates that ATP leakage also occurs during the growth phase of diverse bacterial species and may play an important role in bacterial physiology. ATP can be conveniently measured with high sensitivity in luciferase-based bioluminescence assays. However, wild-type luciferases suffer from low stability, which limit their use. Here we demonstrate that an engineered, thermostable luciferase is suitable for real-time monitoring of ATP release by bacteria, both in broth culture and on agar surfaces. Different bacterial species show distinct patterns of eATP accumulation and decline. Real-time monitoring of eATP allows for the estimation of viable cell number by relating luminescence onset time to initial cell concentration. Furthermore, the method is able to rapidly detect the effect of antibiotics on bacterial cultures as Ampicillin sensitive strains challenged with beta lactam antibiotics showed strongly increased accumulation of eATP even in the absence of growth, as determined by optical density. Patterns of eATP determined by real-time luminescence measurement could be used to infer the minimal inhibitory concentration of Ampicillin. Compared to conventional antibiotic susceptibility testing, the method presented here is faster and more sensitive, which is essential for better treatment outcomes and reducing the risk of inducing antibiotic resistance. Real-time eATP bioluminescence assays are suitable for different cell types, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic, thus, permitting their application in diverse fields of research. It can be used for example in the study of the role of eATP in physiology and pathophysiology, for monitoring microbial contamination or for antimicrobial susceptibility testing in clinical diagnostics."

https://openalex.org/W3125727119,"Objective This overview of reviews aims to map and compare of objectives, methods, and findings of existing systematic reviews to develop a greater understanding of the information available about prolonged beta-lactam infusions in hospitalized patients with infection. Design Overview of systematic reviews. Data sources Medline, Embase, PROSPERO and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from January, 1990 to June, 2019 using a peer reviewed search strategy. Grey literature was also searched for relevant reviews. Eligibility criteria for selecting reviews Systematic reviews were sought that compared two or more infusion strategies for intravenous beta-lactam antimicrobials and report clinical cure or mortality. Populations of included reviews were restricted to hospitalized patients with infection, without restrictions on age, infection type, or disease. Data extraction and analysis Abstract screening, data extraction, quality and risk of bias assessment were conducted by two independent reviewers. Overlap between reviews was assessed using a modified corrected covered area. Overview findings are reported in accordance with Cochrane’s recommendation for overview conduct. Clinical outcomes extracted included survival, clinical cure, treatment failure, microbiological cure, length of stay, adverse events, cost, and emergence of resistance. Results The search strategy identified 3327 unique citations from which 21 eligible reviews were included. Reviews varied by population, intervention and outcomes studied. Between reviews, overlap of primary studies was generally high, methodologic quality generally low and risk of bias variable. Nine of 14 reviews that quantitatively evaluated mortality and clinical cure identified a benefit with prolonged infusions of beta lactams when compared with intermittent infusions. Evidence of mortality and clinical cure benefit was greater among critically ill patients when compared to less sick patients and lower in randomized controlled trials when compared with observational studies. Conclusions Findings from our review demonstrate a consistent and reproducible lack of harm with prolonged infusions of beta-lactam antibiotics with variability in effect size and significance of benefits. Despite 21 systematic reviews addressing prolonged infusions of beta-lactams, this overview supports the continued need for a definitive systematic review given variability in populations, interventions and outcomes in the current systematic reviews. Subsequent systematic reviews should have more rigorous and transparent methods, only include RCTs and evaluate the proposed benefits found in various subgroup-analyses—i.e. high risk of mortality.

https://openalex.org/W3121740756,"Background Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of acquired heart disease among febrile children under the age of 5 years old. It is also a clinically diagnosed disease. In this study, we developed and assessed a novel score system using objective parameters to differentiate Kawasaki disease from febrile children. Methods We analyzed 6,310 febrile children and 485 Kawasaki disease subjects in this study. We collected biological parameters of a routine blood test, including complete blood count with differential, C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase. Receiver operating characteristic curve, logistic regression, and Youden’s index were all used to develop the prediction model. Two other independent cohorts from different hospitals were used for verification. Results We obtained eight independent predictors (platelets, eosinophil, alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and monocyte) and found the top three scores to be eosinophil &gt;1.5% (score: 7), alanine aminotransferase &gt;30 U/L (score: 6), and C-reactive protein&gt;25 mg/L (score: 6). A score of 14 represents the best sensitivity value plus specificity prediction rate for Kawasaki disease. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for our cohort were 0.824, 0.839, and 0.838, respectively. The verification test of two independent cohorts of Kawasaki disease patients (N = 103 and 170) from two different institutes had a sensitivity of 0.780 (213/273). Conclusion Our findings demonstrate a novel score system with good discriminatory ability for differentiating between children with Kawasaki disease and other febrile children, as well as highlight the importance of eosinophil in Kawasaki disease. Using this novel score system can help first-line physicians diagnose and then treat Kawasaki disease early."
https://openalex.org/W3123444790,"When standing, intrinsic ankle stiffness is smaller when measured using large perturbations, when sway size is large, and when background torque is low. However, there is a large variation in individual intrinsic ankle stiffness. Here we determine if individual variation has consequences for postural control. We examined the relationship between ankle stiffness, ankle torque and body sway across different individuals. Ankle stiffness was estimated in 19 standing participants by measuring torque responses to small, brief perturbations. Perturbation sizes of 0.2 &amp; 0.9 degrees (both lasting 140 ms) measured short- and long-range stiffness respectively, while participants either stood quietly on a fixed platform or were imperceptibly tilted to reduce stability (0.1 Hz sinusoid; 0.2 &amp; 0.4 deg). The spontaneous body sway component (natural random relatively rapid postural adjustments) and background ankle torque were averaged from sections immediately before perturbations. The results show that, first, intrinsic ankle stiffness is positively associated with ankle torque, and that this relationship is stronger for long-range stiffness. Second, intrinsic ankle stiffness is negatively associated with body sway, but, in contrast to the relationship with torque, this relationship is stronger for short-range stiffness. We conclude that high short-range intrinsic ankle stiffness is associated with reduced spontaneous sway, although the causal relationship between these two parameters is unknown. These results suggest that, in normal quiet standing where sway is very small, the most important determinant of intrinsic ankle stiffness may be stillness. In less stable conditions, intrinsic ankle stiffness may be more dependent on ankle torque."
https://openalex.org/W3121292269,"Social media fatigue (SMF), which refers to social media users’ tendency to withdraw from social media because of feeling overwhelmed, is closely related to individuals’ social life and well-being. Many studies focused on understanding SMF and exploring its enablers and influences. However, few pieces of research administered a standard measurement of SMF. This study aimed to develop and validate a measure of SMF, and a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1599 participants in total. Semi-structured interviews of 30 participants were firstly conducted as a pilot study, and an initial version of the social media fatigue scale (SMFS) with 24 items was generated. Then, both exploratory factor analysis (N = 509) and confirmatory factor analysis (N = 552) as well as reliability and validity analysis (N = 508) were conducted and a 15-item SMFS was finally developed. The results demonstrated that: 1) SMF was a multi-dimension concept including a cognitive aspect, an emotional aspect and a behavioral aspect; 2) the three-dimensional structure of the SMFS (cognitive-behavioral-emotional structure) fitted the data well; 3) the McDonald’s Omega coefficients for the SMFS was 0.83, suggesting that the SMFS was reliable; 4) criterion validity was satisfactory as indicated by both the significant correlations between self-rated scores of fatigue and total SMFS scores and the significant regression model of SMF on social media privacy, social media confidence, and negative feeling after comparison. Based on the Limited Capacity Model, the present study expanded SMF from a unidimensional model to a three-dimension model, and developed a 15-item SMFS. The study enriched the existing knowledge of SMF, and coined a reliable and valid tool for measuring it. Besides, concluding the typical characteristics of SMF, the study may provide some inspiration for both researchers and social media managers and operators in mitigating SMF."
https://openalex.org/W3121234258,"A simple method for extraction of high quality RNA from cells that have been fixed, stained and sorted by flow cytometry would allow routine transcriptome analysis of highly purified cell populations and single cells. However, formaldehyde fixation impairs RNA extraction and inhibits RNA amplification. Here we show that good quality RNA can be readily extracted from stained and sorted mammalian cells if formaldehyde is replaced by glyoxal—a well-characterised fixative that is widely compatible with immunofluorescent staining methods. Although both formaldehyde and glyoxal efficiently form protein-protein crosslinks, glyoxal does not crosslink RNA to proteins nor form stable RNA adducts, ensuring that RNA remains accessible and amenable to enzymatic manipulation after glyoxal fixation. We find that RNA integrity is maintained through glyoxal fixation, permeabilisation with methanol or saponin, indirect immunofluorescent staining and flow sorting. RNA can then be extracted by standard methods and processed into RNA-seq libraries using commercial kits; mRNA abundances measured by poly(A)+ RNA-seq correlate well between freshly harvested cells and fixed, stained and sorted cells. We validate the applicability of this approach to flow cytometry by staining MCF-7 cells for the intracellular G2/M-specific antigen cyclin B1 (CCNB1), and show strong enrichment for G2/M-phase cells based on transcriptomic data. Switching to glyoxal fixation with RNA-compatible staining methods requires only minor adjustments of most existing staining and sorting protocols, and should facilitate routine transcriptomic analysis of sorted cells."
https://openalex.org/W3122858134,"Spatial neglect (SN) is a common cognitive disorder after brain injury. Prism adaptation treatment (PAT) is one of the promising interventions for SN albeit inconsistent results from previous studies. We carried out a comparison intervention (PAT vs. Sham) and aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PAT on visuospatial symptoms of SN in an inpatient rehabilitation setting that offered a highly intensive comprehensive brain injury rehabilitation program. A total of 34 patients with moderate-to-severe SN secondary to stroke or traumatic brain injury were randomized to the PAT group and the Sham group (an active control group). Both groups received 10 sessions of treatment, over two weeks, in addition to the rehabilitation therapies provided by their rehabilitation care teams. Outcomes were measured using an ecological instrument (the Catherine Bergego Scale) and paper-and-pencil tests (the Bells Test, the Line Bisection Test and the Scene Copying Test). Patients were assessed at baseline, immediately after treatment, two weeks after treatment, and four weeks after treatment. 23 (67.6%) patients completed treatment and all the assessment sessions and were included in the final analyses using mixed linear modeling. While SN symptoms reduced in both groups, we found no difference between the two groups in the degree of improvement. In addition, the average SN recovery rates were 39.1% and 28.6% in the PAT and Sham groups, respectively, but this discrepancy did not reach statistical significance. Thus, the present study suggests that PAT may contribute little to SN care in the context of a highly intensive inpatient rehabilitation program. Further large-scale investigation is required to uncover the mechanisms underlying PAT and Sham in order to refine the treatment or create new interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3125428483,"Litter size is one of the most important economic traits in sheep. Identification of gene variants that are associated with the prolificacy rate is an important step in breeding program success and profitability of the farm. So, to identify genetic mechanisms underlying the variation in litter size in Iranian Baluchi sheep, a two-step genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed. GWAS was conducted using genotype data from 91 Baluchi sheep. Estimated breeding values (EBVs) for litter size calculated for 3848 ewes and then used as the response variable. Besides, a pathway analysis using GO and KEGG databases were applied as a complementary approach. A total of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with litter size were identified, one each on OAR2, OAR10, and OAR25. The SNP on OAR2 is located within a novel putative candidate gene, Neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 2. This gene product works as a receptor which is essential for follicular assembly, early follicular growth, and oocyte survival. The SNP on OAR25 is located within RAB4A which is involved in blood vessel formation and proliferation through angiogenesis. The SNP on OAR10 was not associated with any gene in the 1Mb span. Moreover, gene-set analysis using the KEGG database identified several pathways, such as Ovarian steroidogenesis, Steroid hormone biosynthesis, Calcium signaling pathway, and Chemokine signaling. Also, pathway analysis using the GO database revealed several functional terms, such as cellular carbohydrate metabolic, biological adhesion, cell adhesion, cell junction, and cell-cell adherens junction, among others. This is the first study that reports the NTRK2 gene affecting litter size in sheep and our study of this gene functions showed that this gene could be a good candidate for further analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3123347131,"Background In response to the Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, in-patient units in hospitals around the world have altered their patient care routines and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) practices. Our interdisciplinary team of applied Human Factors (HF), ethnography, and IPC experts assisted one Unit, normally serving general surgical and orthopedic patients, as it rapidly converted to deliver COVID-19-specific care. This paper describes the conversion experience of the Unit, and outlines broader lessons for other acute care teams faced with similar issues. Methods We deployed walkthroughs, simulations, and ethnography to identify important safety gaps in care delivery processes on the Unit. These interventions were undertaken using interdisciplinary theories of implementation that combined systems-level HF perspectives, ethnographic approaches, and individual-level IPC perspectives. Timely recommendations were developed and delivered to Unit staff for feedback and implementation. Results We describe three interventions on the Unit: 1) the de-cluttering and re-organization of personal protective equipment (PPE); 2) the reconfiguring of designated ‘dirty’ tray tables and supplies; and 3) the redesign of handling pathways for ‘dirty’ linens and laundry. Each of these interventions was implemented to varying degrees, but all contributed to discussions of safety and IPC implementation that extended beyond the Unit and into the operations of the broader hospital. Conclusions Leveraging our team’s interdisciplinary expertise and blended approaches to implementation, the interventions assisted in the Unit’s rapid conversion towards providing COVID-19-specific care. The deployment and implementation of the interventions highlight the potential of collaboration between HF, ethnography, and IPC experts to support frontline healthcare delivery under pandemic conditions in an effort to minimize nosocomial transmission potential in the acute healthcare setting."
https://openalex.org/W3124673583,"This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of Technology Lipido-Colloid with Nano Oligo Saccharide Factor (TLC-NOSF) wound dressings versus neutral dressings in the management of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) from a French collective perspective. We used a Markov microsimulation cohort model to simulate the DFU monthly progression over the lifetime horizon. Our study employed a mixed method design with model inputs including data from interventional and observational studies, French databases and expert opinion. The demographic characteristics of the simulated population and clinical efficacy were based on the EXPLORER double-blind randomized controlled trial. Health-related quality of life, costs, and resource use inputs were taken from the literature relevant to the French context. The main outcomes included life-years without DFU (LYs w/DFU ), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), amputations, and lifetime costs. To assess the robustness of the results, sensitivity and subgroup analyses based on the wound duration at treatment initiation were performed. Treatment with the TLC-NOSF dressing led to total cost savings per patient of EUR 35,489, associated with gains of 0.50 LY w/DFU and 0.16 QALY. TLC-NOSF dressings were established as the dominant strategy in the base case and all sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, the model revealed that, for every 100 patients treated with TLC-NOSF dressings, two amputations could be avoided. According to the subgroup analysis results, the sooner the TLC-NOSF treatment was initiated, the better were the outcomes, with the highest benefits for ulcers with a duration of two months or less (+0.65 LY w/DFU , +0.23 QALY, and cost savings of EUR 55,710). The results from the French perspective are consistent with the ones from the German and British perspectives. TLC-NOSF dressings are cost-saving compared to neutral dressings, leading to an increase in patients’ health benefits and a decrease in the associated treatment costs. These results can thus be used to guide healthcare decisionmakers. The potential savings could represent EUR 3,345 per treated patient per year and even reach EUR 4,771 when TLC-NOSF dressings are used as first line treatment. The EXPLORER trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01717183."
https://openalex.org/W3122598154,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the largest infectious disease with 10 million new active-TB patients and1.7 million deaths per year. Active-TB is an inflammatory disease and is increasingly viewed as an imbalance of immune responses to M . tb . infection. The mechanisms of a switch from latent infection to active disease is not well worked out but a shift in the immune responses is thought to be responsible. Increasingly, the role of gut microbiota has been described as a major influencer of the immune system. And because the gut is the largest immune organ, we aimed to analyze the gut microbiome in active-TB patients in a TB-endemic country, Pakistan. The study revealed that Ruminococcacea , Enetrobactericeae , Erysipelotrichaceae , Bifidobacterium , etc. were the major genera associated with active-TB, also associated with chronic inflammatory disease. Plasma antibody profiles against several M . tb . antigens, as specific biomarkers for active-TB, correlated closely with the patient gut microbial profiles. Besides, bcoA gene copy number, indicative of the level of butyrate production by the gut microbiome was five-fold lower in TB patients compared to healthy individuals. These findings suggest that gut health in TB patients is compromised, with implications for disease morbidity (e.g., severe weight loss) as well as immune impairment."
https://openalex.org/W3123841860,"Background Pregnancies that occur in the first year after birth can result in adverse outcomes for the mothers and their babies. Postpartum family planning (PPFP) can save lives of many mothers and children. Only few data are available about the magnitude of PPFP use and its determinants in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Objective To assess PPFP utilization and associated factors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Method A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2018. A total of 625 women were enrolled in the study. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software was used to analyze the data. Binary logistic regression model with adjusted odd ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to identify the factors associated with PPFP use. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. Result The magnitude of PPFP utilization in Addis Ababa was 71.8%. Previous family planning (FP) information (AOR = 13.2; 95% CI: (1.96, 88.07)), FP information from health facility visit (AOR = 2.23; 95% CI: (1.45, 3.43)), antenatal care (AOR = 4.96; 95% CI: (1.58, 15.64)), counseling on FP at postnatal care (AOR = 1.97; 95% CI: (1.27, 3.05)), menses resumption after birth (AOR = 1.75; 95% CI: (1.11, 2.76)), and commencing sexual activity after birth (AOR = 9.34; 95% CI: (5.39, 16.17)) were the factors associated with PPFP use. Conclusion and recommendation Though the magnitude of PPFP use is encouraging, still three out of the ten postpartum women did not use PPFP. The determinants of PPFP use were having FP information, having FP information from health facility visit, antenatal care, counseling about FP during postnatal care, menses resumption after birth, and commencing sexual activity after birth. The health system in the City and the healthcare providers should strive to reach every woman who is not accessing the PPFP services and antenatal care services, and improve counseling services on PPFP during delivery and postnatal care services."
https://openalex.org/W3121977077,"Data obtained in primarily Caucasian (C) and African American adults show that ethnicity does not mediate responsiveness to exercise training. It is unknown if Hispanics (H), who face elevated health risks and are less active than C, exhibit a similar response to exercise training. This study compared cardiorespiratory and hemodynamic responses to high intensity interval training (HIIT) between C and H women. Twelve C and ten H women ages 19–35 yr who were non-obese and inactive completed nine sessions of HIIT over a 3 wk period. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) was assessed twice at baseline during which thoracic impedance was used to evaluate heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO). Habitual physical activity was assessed using accelerometry. Results showed a significant main effect of training for VO 2 max in C and H (F = 13.97, p = 0.001) and no group by training interaction (p = 0.65). There was a main effect of training for CO and SV in C and H (F = 7.57, p = 0.01; F = 7.16, p = 0.02), yet post hoc analyses revealed significant increases were only exhibited in C. There was a tendency for a group by training interaction for a-VO 2 diff (F = 1.32, p = 0.054), and a large effect size was seen in H (d = 1.02). Overall, data show no effect of ethnicity on changes in VO 2 max with low-volume HIIT, yet C and H may achieve this outcome differently. Longer studies in similar populations are needed to verify this result."
https://openalex.org/W3122288501,"The pathological interaction between oak trees and Phytophthora cinnamomi has implications in the cork oak decline observed over the last decades in the Iberian Peninsula. During host colonization, the phytopathogen secretes effector molecules like elicitins to increase disease effectiveness. The objective of this study was to unravel the proteome changes associated with the cork oak immune response triggered by P . cinnamomi inoculation in a long-term assay, through SWATH-MS quantitative proteomics performed in the oak leaves. Using the Arabidopis proteome database as a reference, 424 proteins were confidently quantified in cork oak leaves, of which 80 proteins showed a p-value below 0.05 or a fold-change greater than 2 or less than 0.5 in their levels between inoculated and control samples being considered as altered. The inoculation of cork oak roots with P . cinnamomi increased the levels of proteins associated with protein-DNA complex assembly, lipid oxidation, response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, and pyridine-containing compound metabolic process in the leaves. In opposition, several proteins associated with cellular metabolic compound salvage and monosaccharide catabolic process had significantly decreased abundances. The most significant abundance variations were observed for the Ribulose 1,5-Bisphosphate Carboxylase small subunit (RBCS1A), Heat Shock protein 90–1 (Hsp90-1), Lipoxygenase 2 (LOX2) and Histone superfamily protein H3.3 (A8MRLO/At4G40030) revealing a pertinent role for these proteins in the host-pathogen interaction mechanism. This work represents the first SWATH-MS analysis performed in cork oak plants inoculated with P . cinnamomi and highlights host proteins that have a relevant action in the homeostatic states that emerge from the interaction between the oomycete and the host in the long term and in a distal organ."
https://openalex.org/W3123264356,"Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in Vietnam pioneered the practice of clinical pharmacy; however, hospitals in HCMC have faced numerous challenges that might influence the job satisfaction of clinical pharmacists (CPs). Additionally, there have been no official statistics about clinical pharmacy activities that have been reported so far. Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the current status of the clinical pharmacy profession and to analyze the key factors affecting job satisfaction of CPs in HCMC. This was a cross-sectional study. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to all the CPs in all the 128 hospitals in HCMC via an online survey tool from May to June 2020. Only about 30% of the respondents were full-time CPs. The percentage of CPs participating in clinical wards was relatively low (52.79%). “Provide drug information for patients and medical employees ” was the most common clinical pharmacy activity, with the percentage of CPs participating in it being nearly 90%. Overall, 74.1% of the 197 CPs surveyed were satisfied with their current job. The factors that they were satisfied with the most and the least were “Inter &amp; Intra professional relationships” (95.9%) and “Income” (59.9%), respectively. The only demographic and work-related characteristic that had a statistically significant association with overall job satisfaction was “Ward round participation” . Most clinical pharmacy tasks noted a high rate of participation from the CPs. Nevertheless, hospitals in HCMC was found to be experiencing a shortage of CPs and low levels of participation of CPs in ward rounds, and most CPs were unable to completely focus on clinical pharmacy tasks. Regarding CPs’ job satisfaction-related aspects, income and ward round participation appear to be the two factors that should be increased, in order to enhance CPs’ job satisfaction."

Regression analyses indicated that children's learning performance moderated the relationship between socioeconomic status and both syntactic and vocabulary language comprehension scores. For children demonstrating high learning, socioeconomic status had a weaker effect on language compared to children showing low learning. These results suggest that high statistical learning ability can provide a buffer against the disadvantages associated with being raised in a lower socioeconomic status household."
https://openalex.org/W3125363940,"The processed pseudogene PTENP1 is involved in the regulation of the expression of the PTEN and acts as a tumor suppressor in many types of malignances. In our previous study we showed that PTENP1 methylation is present not only in tumor, but also in normal endometrium tissues of women over 45 years old. Here we used methylation-specific PCR to analyze methylation status of CpG island located near promoter region of PTENP1 in malignant and non-malignant endometrium tissues collected from 236 women of different age groups. To confirm our results, we also analyzed RNA sequencing and microarray data from 431 women with endometrial cancer from TCGA database. We demonstrated that methylation of PTENP1 is significantly increased in older patients. We also found an age-dependent increase in the level of PTENP1 expression in endometrial tissue. According to our data, PTENP1 methylation elevates the level of the pseudogene sense transcript. In turn, a high level of this transcript correlates with a more favorable prognosis in endometrial cancer. The data obtained suggested that PTENP1 methylation is associated with age-related changes in normal and hyperplastic endometrial tissues. We assumed that age-related increase in PTENP1 methylation and subsequent elevation of its expression may serve as a protective mechanism aimed to prevent malignant transformation of endometrial tissue in women during the perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause periods."
https://openalex.org/W3122723786,"This paper examines an important but underappreciated mechanism affecting urban segregation and integration: urban venues. The venue- an area where urbanites interact- is an essential aspect of city life that tends to influence residential location. We study the venue/segregation relationship by overlaying venues onto Schelling’s classic (1971) [1] agent-based segregation model. We show that a simulation world with venues makes segregation less likely among relatively tolerant agents and more likely among the intolerant. We also show that multiple venues can create spatial structures beyond their catchment areas and that the initial location of venues shapes later residential patterns. Finally, we demonstrate that the social rules governing venue participation alter their impacts on segregation. In the course of our study, we compile techniques for advancing Schelling-style studies of urban environments and catalogue a set of mechanisms that operate in this environment."
https://openalex.org/W3122744905,"The purpose of this study was to cross-sectionally estimate the prevalence of recreational running in Portugal and describe characteristics of adult recreational runners. A random representative sample of 1068 Portuguese adults was selected. Socio-demographic information, physical activity habits and running behavior were assessed. Recreational runners’ training habits, motivations, barriers, vitality and flow were also assessed. The prevalence of recreational running in Portugal was 10.6%. It was higher in men (14.6% vs. 6.6%, p = .024) and in younger runners (13.6% vs. 7.7%, p = .026). Participants ran on average 3 times, 20 kilometers and 3 hours per week. General health orientation (88%), self-esteem (63%), and life meaning (57%) were the most predominant motives for running, while time was the most prevalent barrier (43%). This first Portuguese running prevalence representative study, indicates that almost 11% of adults ran regularly, and describes correlates of running, which can inform future running promotion interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3123399547,"There is a growing interest in studying consistency and site fidelity of individuals to assess, respectively, how individual behaviour shapes the population response to environmental changes, and to highlight the critical habitats needed by species. In Antarctica, the foraging activity of central place foragers like Adélie penguins ( Pygoscelis adeliae ) is constrained by the sea-ice cover during the breeding season. We estimated the population-level repeatability in foraging trip parameters and sea-ice conditions encountered by birds across successive trips over several years, and we examined their foraging site fidelity linked to sea-ice concentrations throughout the chick-rearing season. Penguins’ foraging activity was repeatable despite varying annual sea-ice conditions. Birds’ site fidelity is constrained by both sea-ice conditions around the colony that limit movements and resources availability, and also behavioural repeatability of individuals driven by phenological constraints. Adélie penguins favoured sea-ice concentrations between 20–30%, as these facilitate access to open water while opening multiple patches for exploration in restricted areas in case of prey depletion. When the sea-ice concentration became greater than 30%, foraging site fidelity decreased and showed higher variability, while it increased again after 60%. Between two trips, the foraging site fidelity remained high when sea-ice concentration changed by ± 10% but showed greater variability when sea-ice concentrations differed on a larger range. In summary, Adélie penguins specialize their foraging behaviour during chick-rearing according to sea-ice conditions to enhance their reproductive success. The balance between being consistent under favourable environmental conditions vs. being flexible under more challenging conditions may be key to improving foraging efficiency and reproductive success to face fast environmental changes."
https://openalex.org/W3125428379,"Background Tai Chi (TC) mind-body exercise has been shown to reduce falls and improve balance and gait, however, few studies have evaluated the role of lower extremity muscle activation patterns in the observed benefits of TC on mobility. Purpose To perform an exploratory analysis of the association between TC training and levels of lower extremity muscle co-contraction in healthy adults during walking under single-task (ST) and cognitive dual-task (DT) conditions. Methods Surface electromyography of the anterior tibialis and lateral gastrocnemius muscles was recorded during 90 sec trials of overground ST (walking normally) and DT (walking with verbalized serial subtractions) walking. A mean co-contraction index (CCI), across all strides, was calculated based on the percentage of total muscle activity when antagonist muscles were simultaneously activated. A hybrid study design investigated long-term effects of TC via a cross-sectional comparison of 27 TC experts and 60 age-matched TC-naïve older adults. A longitudinal comparison assessed the shorter-term effects of TC; TC-naïve participants were randomly allocated to either 6 months of TC training or to usual care. Results Across all participants at baseline, greater CCI was correlated with slower gait speed under DT (β(95% CI) = -26.1(-48.6, -3.7)) but not ST (β(95% CI) = -15.4(-38.2, 7.4)) walking. Linear models adjusting for age, gender, BMI and other factors that differed at baseline indicated that TC experts exhibited lower CCI compared to TC naives under DT, but not ST conditions (ST: mean difference (95% CI) = -7.1(-15.2, 0.97); DT: mean difference (95% CI) = -10.1(-18.1, -2.4)). No differences were observed in CCI for TC-naive adults randomly assigned to 6 months of TC vs. usual care. Conclusion Lower extremity muscle co-contraction may play a role in the observed benefit of longer-term TC training on gait and postural control. Longer-duration and adequately powered randomized trials are needed to evaluate the effect of TC on neuromuscular coordination and its impact on postural control. Trial registration The randomized trial component of this study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT01340365 )."
https://openalex.org/W3121624997,"Leafy sweet potato is rich in total phenolics (TP) which play key roles in health protection, the chlorogenic acid (CGA) constitutes the major components of phenolic compounds in leafy sweet potato. Unfortunately, the mechanism of CGA biosynthesis in leafy sweet potato is unclear. To dissect the mechanisms of CGA biosynthesis, we performed transcriptome, small RNA (sRNA) and degradome sequencing of one low-CGA content and one high-CGA content genotype at two stages. A total of 2,333 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and the enriched DEGs were related to photosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. The functional genes, such as CCR, CCoAOMT and HCT in the CGA biosynthetic pathway were down-regulated, indicating that the way to lignin was altered, and two possible CGA biosynthetic routes were hypothesized. A total of 38 DE miRNAs were identified, and 1,799 targets were predicated for 38 DE miRNAs by using in silico approaches. The target genes were enriched in lignin and phenylpropanoid catabolic processes. Transcription factors (TFs) such as apetala2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) and Squamosa promoter binding protein-like (SPL) predicated in silico were validated by degradome sequencing. Association analysis of the DE miRNAs and transcriptome datasets identified that miR156 family negatively targeted AP2/ERF and SPL. Six mRNAs and six miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR, and the results showed that the expression levels of the mRNAs and miRNAs were consistent with the sequencing data. This study established comprehensive functional genomic resources for the CGA biosynthesis, and provided insights into the molecular mechanisms involving in this process. The results also enabled the first perceptions of the regulatory roles of mRNAs and miRNAs, and offered candidate genes for leafy sweet potato improvements."
https://openalex.org/W3122556574,"A novel conversation-analytically informed paradigm was used to examine how joint decision-making interaction, with its various types of proposal sequences, is reflected in the physiological responses of participants. Two types of dyads–dyads with one depressed and one non-depressed participant (N = 15) and dyads with two non-depressed participants (N = 15)–engaged in a series of conversational joint decision-making tasks, during which we measured their skin conductance (SC) responses. We found that the participants’ SC response rates were higher and more synchronized during proposal sequences than elsewhere in the conversation. Furthermore, SC response rates were higher when the participant was in the role of a proposal speaker (vs. a proposal recipient), and making a proposal was associated with higher SC response rates for participants with depression (vs. participants without depression). Moreover, the SC response rates in the proposal speaker were higher when the recipient accepted (vs. not accepted) the proposal. We interpret this finding with reference to accepting responses suggesting a commitment to future action, for which the proposal speaker may feel specifically responsible for. A better understanding of the physiological underpinnings of joint decision-making interaction may help improve democratic practices in contexts where certain individuals experience challenges in this regard."
https://openalex.org/W3124848405,"Urbanization is among the largest threats to wildlife populations through factors such as fragmentation, isolation, and habitat destruction. Urban open spaces, such as parks and golf courses, have the potential to provide wildlife with suitable habitat within an urbanized matrix. These refugia may be particularly important for amphibians, which represent one of the most endangered and least vagile vertebrate groups on earth. During the spring and summer of 2018, we conducted surveys to determine the presence of anurans at 51 wetland sites within the Piedmont ecoregion of South Carolina. Nearly one-third of these wetlands were located within urban open spaces, one-third in low development areas, and one-third in highly developed areas. Impervious surface and total road length surrounding the wetlands were measured at two scales, a core habitat scale (300 m) and average maximum migration scale (750 m), and we measured several within-wetland habitat variables. Urban Open Space wetlands had levels of surrounding impervious surface similar to High Urbanization wetlands at the larger scale and were intermediate between Low and High Urbanization wetlands at the smaller scale. The total length of road segments occurring within buffers (at both scales) surrounding our study wetlands was higher for Urban Open Space compared to Low and High Urbanization sites. Among the within-wetland variables measured, Low Urbanization sites had higher canopy cover and were more likely to have a terrestrial buffer zone relative to the other categories. Species richness decreased significantly as total road length increased among all wetlands. Wetland category was not a significant driver explaining species richness, but β-diversity was more variable among Urban Open Space wetlands than either Low or High Urbanization wetlands. Urban Open Space wetlands did not appear to increase suitability for anurans relative to High Urbanization wetlands. Urban Open Space wetlands had higher variability in species composition, which was perhaps attributable to the diversity among sites represented in the Urban Open Space category."
https://openalex.org/W3121140780,"In this work, we explore the possibility of using a heterogeneous Susceptible- Infected-Susceptible SIS spreading process on an airline network to model airport congestion contagion with the objective to reproduce airport vulnerability. We derive the vulnerability of each airport from the US Airport Network data as the congestion probability of each airport. In order to capture diverse flight features between airports, e.g. frequency and duration, we construct three types of airline networks. The infection rate of each link in the SIS spreading process is proportional to its corresponding weight in the underlying airline network constructed. The recovery rate of each node is also heterogeneous, dependent on its node strength in the underlying airline network, which is the total weight of the links incident to the node. Such heterogeneous recovery rate is motivated by the fact that large airports may recover fast from congestion due to their well-equipped infrastructures. The nodal infection probability in the meta-stable state is used as a prediction of the vulnerability of the corresponding airport. We illustrate that our model could reproduce the distribution of nodal vulnerability and rank the airports in vulnerability evidently better than the SIS model whose recovery rate is homogeneous. The vulnerability is the largest at airports whose strength in the airline network is neither too large nor too small. This phenomenon can be captured by our heterogeneous model, but not the homogeneous model where a node with a larger strength has a higher infection probability. This explains partially the out-performance of the heterogeneous model. This proposed congestion contagion model may shed lights on the development of strategies to identify vulnerable airports and to mitigate global congestion by e.g. congestion reduction at selected airports."
https://openalex.org/W3122961399,"Introduction It has been estimated that between 15% and 18% of patients who start antiretroviral therapy (ART) do not achieve a successful immune recovery despite complete virological suppression. In the literature this phenomenom is known as poor immune recovery or immunovirological discordance (IVD). Zinc has an immunomodulatory role associated with T lymphocytes and its supplementation could enhance immune recovery. Objective To determine if zinc supplementation on IVD patients prevents immune failure after 12 months of supplementation. Secondary objectives were to determine serum zinc levels in HIV patients with and without IVD and the frequency of hypozincemia in discordant patients. Method We reviewed the historical record of patients under care at Arriarán Foundation. Following inclusion criteria were defined: 1) age ≥ 18 years, 2) standard ART (three effective drugs) for at least 18 months, 3) virologically suppressed for 12 months, 3) persistence of CD4 count ≤200 cells/mm 3 and/or increase ≤ 80 cells/mm 3 after one year of viral undetectability. A control group was assigned paired 1:1 by sex, age (± 2 years) that did achieved an increase of CD4&gt; 350 cells/ mm 3 . In both groups plasma zinc levels were determined. In a later phase, patients with IVD were randomized to receive zinc (15 mg daily) versus placebo. Patients were followed for 12 months with CD4 count, viral load and zinc levels determinations every 4–6 months. Results A total of 80 patients, 40 patients with IVD criteria and 40 controls were included. 92.5% were men, and age average was 47.5 years. The median baseline CD4 was 189 cells/mm 3 (71–258) in the cases vs. 552.5 cells/ mm 3 (317–400) in the control group with a median increase at the end of the study of 39 cell/mm 3 and 19 cell/mm 3 respectively. There was no difference in baseline plasma zinc levels between both groups (81.7 + 18.1 in cases versus 86.2 + 11.0 in controls). In the 40 patients with IVD, the median absolute increase in CD4 after annual zinc supplementation was 31.5 cells/mm 3 in the treated group versus 50 cells/mm 3 in the placebo group, this difference being statistically not significant (p = 0.382). Conclusions Patients with IVD have plasma zinc levels similar to those who achieve adequate immune recovery. Zinc supplementation in IVD patients showed a statistically non-significant difference in in CD4 levels between cases and controls. The results warrant a comparative study with a larger number of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3124130416,"Background The incidence of gestational breast cancer (GBC) is increasing in high-income countries. Our study aimed to examine the epidemiology, management and outcomes of women with GBC in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Methods A retrospective cohort study using linked data from three NSW datasets. The study group comprised women giving birth with a first-time diagnosis of GBC while the comparison group comprised women giving birth without any type of cancer. Outcome measures included incidence of GBC, maternal morbidities, obstetric management, neonatal mortality, and preterm birth. Results Between 1994 and 2013, 122 women with GBC gave birth in NSW (crude incidence 6.8/ 100,000, 95%CI: 5.6–8.0). Women aged ≥35 years had higher odds of GBC (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 6.09, 95%CI 4.02–9.2) than younger women. Women with GBC were more likely to give birth by labour induction or pre-labour CS compared to women with no cancer (AOR 4.8, 95%CI: 2.96–7.79). Among women who gave birth by labour induction or pre-labour CS, the preterm birth rate was higher for women with GBC than for women with no cancer (52% vs 7%; AOR 17.5, 95%CI: 11.3–27.3). However, among women with GBC, preterm birth rate did not differ significantly by timing of diagnosis or cancer stage. Babies born to women with GBC were more likely to be preterm (AOR 12.93, 95%CI 8.97–18.64), low birthweight (AOR 8.88, 95%CI 5.87–13.43) or admitted to higher care (AOR 3.99, 95%CI 2.76–5.76) than babies born to women with no cancer. Conclusion Women aged ≥35 years are at increased risk of GBC. There is a high rate of preterm birth among women with GBC, which is not associated with timing of diagnosis or cancer stage. Most births followed induction of labour or pre-labour CS, with no major short term neonatal morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W3124965936,"Nutritionally-based mutualisms with bacteria are known to occur in a wide array of invertebrate phyla, although less commonly in the Platyhelminthes. Here we report what appears to be a novel example of this type of association in two geographically disparate and phylogenetically distant species of tapeworms of eagle rays—the lecanicephalidean Elicilacunosus dharmadii off the island of Borneo and the tetraphyllidean Caulobothrium multispelaeum off Senegal. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the grooves and apertures on the outer surfaces of both tapeworms open into expansive cavities housing concentrations of bacteria. This led us to reject the original hypothesis that these structures, and their associated mucopolysaccharides, aid in attachment to the host mucosa. The cavities were found to be specialized in-foldings of the tapeworm body that were lined with particularly elongate filitriches. Given tapeworms lack a gut and employ filitriches to assist in nutrient absorption, enhanced nutrient uptake likely occurs in the cavities. Each tapeworm species appeared to host different bacterial monocultures; those in E . dharmadii were coccoid-like in form, while those in C . multispelaeum were bacillus-like. The presence of bacteria in a specialized structure of this nature suggests the structure is a symbiotic organ. Tapeworms are fully capable of obtaining their own nutrients, and thus the bacteria likely serve merely to supplement their diet. Given the bacteria were also extracellular, this structure is more consistent with a mycetome than a trophosome. To our knowledge, this is not only the first evidence of an external symbiotic organ of any type in a nutritionally-based mutualism, but also the first description of a mycetome in a group of invertebrates that lacks a digestive system. The factors that might account for the independent evolution of this unique association in these unrelated tapeworms are unclear—especially given that none of their closest relatives exhibit any evidence of the phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W3126070905,"Human behavior (movement, social contacts) plays a central role in the spread of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2. The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 was driven by global human movement, and initial lockdown measures aimed to localize movement and contact in order to slow spread. Thus, movement and contact patterns need to be explicitly considered when making reopening decisions, especially regarding return to work. Here, as a case study, we consider the initial stages of resuming research at a large research university, using approaches from movement ecology and contact network epidemiology. First, we develop a dynamical pathogen model describing movement between home and work; we show that limiting social contact, via reduced people or reduced time in the workplace are fairly equivalent strategies to slow pathogen spread. Second, we develop a model based on spatial contact patterns within a specific office and lab building on campus; we show that restricting on-campus activities to labs (rather than labs and offices) could dramatically alter (modularize) contact network structure and thus, potentially reduce pathogen spread by providing a workplace mechanism to reduce contact. Here we argue that explicitly accounting for human movement and contact behavior in the workplace can provide additional strategies to slow pathogen spread that can be used in conjunction with ongoing public health efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3035253903,"Sport is becoming increasingly competitive and athletes are being exposed to greater physical demands, leaving them prone to injuries. Monitoring athletes with the use of wearable technology could provide a way to potentially manage training and competition loads and reduce injuries. One such technology is the VERT inertial measurement unit, a commercially available discrete wearable device containing a 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis magnetometer. Some of the main measurement outputs include jump count, jump height and landing impacts. While several studies have examined the accuracy of the VERT’s measures of jump height and jump count, landing impact force has not yet been investigated. The objective of this research study was to explore the validity of the VERT landing impact values. We hypothesized that the absolute peak VERT acceleration values during a jump-land cycle would fall within 10% of the peak acceleration values derived simultaneously from a research-grade accelerometer (Shimmer). Fourteen elite university-level volleyball players each performed 10 jumps while wearing both devices simultaneously. The results showed that VERT peak accelerations were variable (limits of agreement of -84.13% and 52.37%) and had a propensity to be lower (mean bias of -15.88%) when compared to the Shimmer. In conclusion, the validity of the VERT device’s landing impact values are generally poor, when compared to the Shimmer."
https://openalex.org/W3121738358,"Background Independence in daily activities is defined as the ability to perform functions related to daily living, i.e. the capacity of living independently in the community with little or no help from others. Objective We focused on non-attenders as a subgroup of patients whose health status is not well known to family practice teams. Our goal was to estimate the prevalence of dependence and its severity level in the daily activities of patients, and to determine the factors that are associated with the occurrence of dependence. Design Cross-sectional observational study. Settings and participants Data was obtained in family medicine settings. Participants in the study were adults living in the community (aged 18 or over) who had not visited their chosen family physician in the last 5 years (non-attenders) and who were able to participate in the study. Through the electronic system, we identified 2,025 non-attenders. Community nurses collected data in the participants’ homes. The outcome measure was dependence in daily activities, assessed through eight items: personal hygiene; eating and drinking; mobility; dressing and undressing; urination and defecation; continence; avoiding hazards in the environment; and communication. Results The final sample consisted of 1,999 patients (98.7% response rate). The mean age was 59.9 (range 20 to 99). Dependence in daily activities was determined in 466 or 23.3% (95% CI: [21.5, 25.2]) of the patients. Older patients (over 60 years), with at least one chronic disease, increased risk of falling, moderate feelings of loneliness and a lower self-assessment of health were statistically significantly more likely to be dependent in their daily activities, according to our multivariate model. Conclusions A considerable proportion of family practice non-attenders were found to be dependent in daily activities, though at a low level. We identified several factors associated with this dependence. This could help to identify people at risk of being dependent in daily activities in the general adult population, and enable specific interventions that would improve their health status."
https://openalex.org/W3123151538,"Background E-cigarette (EC) use is increasing worldwide. Understanding the practices and perceptions of e-cigarette users and profiling the symptoms they experience is essential for regulating the use of such products. This study aims to investigate the practices and perceptions of e-cigarette users in Jordan and examine the symptoms (e.g. respiratory) they associate with e-cigarette use. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted to assess EC use and tobacco smoking behaviors and the corresponding health symptoms among EC users in Jordan. EC use expectancies were also assessed using the Short Form Vaping Consequences Questionnaire, which was first translated into Arabic and tested for validity and reliability. Results Out of the 400 EC users surveyed, 95.5% were male, 76.2% used nicotine-containing juice, and 56.8% were concurrent tobacco smokers. Further, the participants had a mean age of 28.9 years (±10.2). Among dual EC/cigarette users, 88.6% reported that they tried to quit cigarette smoking, with e-cigarette use being the most commonly tried method of smoking cessation. The smoking-related symptoms reported by regular cigarette smokers mainly included sputum production (77.5%). The participants reported that using e-cigarettes instead of tobacco cigarettes had led to improvements in their sputum production (60.8%), breathing (59%), and general wellbeing (52%). Pleasant taste, enjoyable taste sensation, and flavor were significantly stronger ( P -value &lt; 0.05) among e-cigarette users compared to dual users. Dual EC/cigarette users reported stronger perceptions in the negative consequences scale, particularly with regards to the hazardous effects of smoking on health ( P -value &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Dual daily use of e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes is a common practice among EC users. We recommend that further research is conducted on dual EC/cigarette use and the potential health risks this may have (e.g. higher nicotine intake as compared to the single use of either products)."

Polymorphisms in these genes can lead to the development of various diseases. This study was conducted to examine a potential association between tobacco substance usage (TSU) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the exon regions of the P53, P21, and MDM2 genes by comparing populations of smokers and non-smokers from Saudi Arabia. P53 rs1042522 (C/G), P21 rs1801270 (A/C), and MDM2 rs769412 (A/G) were investigated by genotyping 568 blood specimens: 283 from male/female smokers and 285 from male/female non-smokers. The results obtained from the smokers and their control non-smokers were compared according to age, sex, duration of smoking, and type of TSU. Heterozygous CG, homozygous GG, and CG+GG genotypes, as well as the G allele of rs1042522 were significantly associated with TSU in Saudi smokers compared with non-smokers. The C allele frequency of rs1801270 was also associated with TSU in smokers (OR = 1.33, p = 0.049) in comparison with non-smokers, in younger smokers (≤29 years) (OR = 1.556, p = 0.03280) in comparison with non-smokers of the same age, in smokers who had smoked cigarettes for seven years or less (OR = 1.596, p = 0.00882), and in smokers who had consumed shisha (OR = 1.608, p = 0.04104) in comparison with the controls. However, the genotypic and allelic frequencies for rs769412 did not show significant associations with TSU in Saudis. The selected SNP of P53 was strongly associated with TSU and may be linked to TSU-induced diseases in the Saudi Arabian population."
https://openalex.org/W3124784119,"Data on adverse events from research bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is lacking. As research bronchoscopy with BAL is useful for isolation of immune cells and investigation of CF lung microbiome, we sought to investigate the safety of bronchoscopy in adult patients with CF. Between November 2016 and September 2019, we performed research bronchoscopies on CF subjects (32) and control subjects (82). Control subjects were nonsmokers without respiratory disease. CF subjects had mild or moderate obstructive lung disease (FEV 1 &gt; 50% predicted) and no evidence of recent CF pulmonary exacerbation. There was no significant difference in the age or sex of each cohort. Neither group experienced life threatening adverse events. The number of adverse events was similar between CF and control subjects. The most common adverse events were sore throat and cough, which occurred at similar frequencies in control and CF subjects. Fever and headache occurred more frequently in CF subjects. However, the majority of fevers were seen in CF subjects with FEV 1 values below 65% predicted. We found that CF subjects had similar adverse event profiles following research bronchoscopy compared to healthy subjects. While CF subjects had a higher rate of fevers, this adverse event occurred with greater frequency in CF subjects with lower FEV 1 . Our data demonstrate that research bronchoscopy with BAL is safe in CF subjects and that safety profile is improved if bronchoscopies are limited to subjects with an FEV 1 &gt; 65% predicted."
https://openalex.org/W3124805852,"Background and objectives Schema therapy (ST) has become a mainstream therapy for the treatment of psychopathology and has been validated through a series of large scale, international randomized control trials. Among other things, schema therapy emphasizes the meeting of core emotional needs in children by primary caregivers as these unmet needs continue to adversely affect their lives into adulthood. An early intervention parenting program has been developed to help parents meet these core emotional needs in order to prevent the development of psychopathology in the first place. The program, Good Enough Parenting, is equally focused on reducing problems and strengthening parenting practices, regardless of where the child is on the “disordered to well-being continuum”. This study aims to explore “patient experience” by users of this program. Best clinical research guidelines advocate that participants should be used as collaborators rather than pure recipients; this process should predate large scale trials. Design An exploratory qualitative study with 55 parent-participants of Good Enough Parenting was conducted. Methods One-to-one interviews were conducted with participants, using critical incident technique and guided by semi-structured interview schedule, to explore their experiences with the program. Transcripts were then analyzed using thematic analysis. Results Coding showed a high degree of inter-rater reliability (kappa value of 0.78). The themes that emerged were Cultivating Awareness of Parents’ Own Schemas, Cultivating Intentionality, Working through Developmental Issues, Responses to Challenges at Home, Performing Multiple Roles, and the Learning Process. Participants overwhelmingly reported satisfaction within these key themes. Conclusions The results support the development of the program and the choice of “participant reported outcome measures” for use in subsequent randomized controlled trials."
https://openalex.org/W3119510812,"Background This study aimed to compare incidence, management and outcomes of women transfused their blood volume or more within 24 hours during pregnancy or following childbirth. Methods Combined analysis of individual patient data, prospectively collected in six international population-based studies (France, United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, the Netherlands and Denmark). Massive transfusion in major obstetric haemorrhage was defined as transfusion of eight or more units of red blood cells within 24 hours in a pregnant or postpartum woman. Causes, management and outcomes of women with massive transfusion were compared across countries using descriptive statistics. Findings The incidence of massive transfusion was approximately 21 women per 100,000 maternities for the United Kingdom, Australia and Italy; by contrast Denmark, the Netherlands and France had incidences of 82, 66 and 69 per 100,000 maternities, respectively. There was large variation in obstetric and haematological management across countries. Fibrinogen products were used in 86% of women in Australia, while the Netherlands and Italy reported lower use at 35–37% of women. Tranexamic acid was used in 75% of women in the Netherlands, but in less than half of women in the UK, Australia and Italy. In all countries, women received large quantities of colloid/crystalloid fluids during resuscitation (&gt;3·5 litres). There was large variation in the use of compression sutures, embolisation and hysterectomy across countries. There was no difference in maternal mortality; however, variable proportions of women had cardiac arrests, renal failure and thrombotic events from 0–16%. Interpretation There was considerable variation in the incidence of massive transfusion associated with major obstetric haemorrhage across six high-income countries. There were also large disparities in both transfusion and obstetric management between these countries. There is a requirement for detailed evaluation of evidence underlying current guidance. Furthermore, cross-country comparison may empower countries to reference their clinical care against that of other countries."
https://openalex.org/W3121470442,"Spatial structuring of mid-trophic level forage communities in the Gulf of Alaska (GoA) is poorly understood, even though it has clear implications for the health of fisheries and marine wildlife populations. Here, we test the hypothesis that summertime (May-August) mesozooplankton communities are spatially-persistent across years of varying ocean conditions, including during the marine heatwave of 2014–2016. We use spatial ordinations and hierarchical clustering of Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) sampling over 17 years (2000–2016) to (1) characterize typical zooplankton communities in different regions of the GoA, and (2) investigate spatial structuring relative to variation in ocean temperatures and circulation. Five regional communities were identified, each representing distinct variation in the abundance of 18 primary zooplankton taxa: a distinct cluster of coastal taxa on the continental shelf north of Vancouver Island; a second cluster in the western GoA associated with strong currents and cold water east of Unimak Pass; a shelf break cluster rich in euphausiids found at both the eastern and western margins of the GoA; a broad offshore cluster of abundant pelagic zooplankton in the southern GoA gyre associated with stable temperature and current conditions; and a final offshore cluster exhibiting low zooplankton abundance concentrated along the northeastern arm of the subarctic gyre where ocean conditions are dominated by eddy activity. When comparing years of anomalous warm and cold sea surface temperatures, we observed change in the spatial structure in coastal communities, but little change (i.e., spatial persistence) in the northwestern GoA basin. Whereas previous studies have shown within-region variability in zooplankton communities in response to ocean climate, we highlight both consistency and change in regional communities, with interannual variability in shelf communities and persistence in community structure offshore. These results suggest greater variability in coastal food webs than in the central portion of the GoA, which may be important to energy exchange from lower to upper trophic levels in the mesoscale biomes of this ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W3122046663,"Coiled tubing (CT) has been widely used for oil and gas exploitation, however corrosion of CT under high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) environment was often reported, also corrosion induced failures of CT welds were often observed to occur during service. Corrosion related behaviors of CT welds are not clear. Therefore, a study of the corrosion resistance of CT welds under HPHT environment is carried out. In order to efficiently evaluate the corrosion resistance of welds, some test samples were obtained by linear cutting out of a CT110 in service on the site. The water samples from gas field were used as the test reagent to simulate the actual corrosive medium. Based on the results of weight loss test under HPHT corrosive environment and tensile test under room conditions, the corrosion sensitivities of the welding seam and base material under various temperatures and partial pressures of CO 2 as well as the mechanical properties of the corroded CT were compared and evaluated quantitatively, the corrosion morphologies and material products of the test samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The test results showed that the corrosion rates of the welding seam in a HPHT caldron were 1.7, 2.0 and 1.2 times of the base metal’s when the total pressure is 4MPa, and the temperature is 30°C, 60°C and 90°C, respectively. The corrosion rates of the welding seam is 2.0, 2.1 and 2.0 times of the base metal’s when the partial pressure of CO 2 is 0.1MPa, 0.2MPa and 0.3MPa, respectively. The yield strength of the weld seam after corrosion test was found to be reduced by 4.8% (the yield strength of the base metal was reduced by 4.0%) and its tensile strength was reduced by 8.2% (the base metal was reduced by 7.1%). This indicates that CT weld seam is more susceptible to corrosion than CT base material under service condition."
https://openalex.org/W3125101690,"Aim To evaluate the prevalence and associated factors of abnormal renal function among Ethiopian HIV-infected patients at baseline prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and during follow-up. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of HIV infected patients who initiated ART at the outpatient ART clinic of Mehal Meda Hospital of North Shewa, Ethiopia from January 2012 to August 2018. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from the medical records of patients. Renal function was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to determine the factors associated with abnormal renal function at baseline and during follow-up. Results Among 353 patients, 70 (19.8%) had baseline eGFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m 2 and 102 (28.9%) had eGFR = 60–89.9 ml/min/1.73m 2 . Factors associated with baseline renal impairment (eGFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m 2 ) included female sex (AOR = 3.52, CI 1.75–7.09), CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/mm 3 (AOR = 2.75, CI 1.40–5.42), BMI &lt; 25 Kg/m 2 (AOR = 3.04, CI 1.15–8.92), low hemoglobin (AOR = 2.19, CI 1.16–4.09) and high total cholesterol (AOR = 3.15, CI 1.68–5.92). After a median of 3.0 years of ART, the mean eGFR declined from 112.9 ± 81.2 ml/min/1.73m 2 at baseline to 93.9 ± 60.6 ml/min/1.73m 2 ( P &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of renal impairment increased from 19.8% at baseline to 22.1% during follow-up. Of 181 patients with baseline normal renal function, 49.7% experienced some degree of renal impairment. Older age (AOR = 3.85, 95% CI 2.03–7.31), female sex (AOR = 4.18, 95% CI 2.08–8.40), low baseline CD4 (AOR = 2.41, 95% CI 1.24–4.69), low current CD4 count (AOR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.15–4.68), high BMI (AOR = 2.91, 95% CI 1.49–5.71), and low hemoglobin (AOR = 3.38, 95% CI 2.00–7.46) were the factors associated with renal impairment during follow-up. Conclusion Impaired renal function was common in HIV-infected patients initiating ART in an outpatient setting in Ethiopia, and there appears to be a high prevalence of renal impairment after a median ART follow-up of 3 years. There is a need for assessment of renal function at baseline before ART initiation and regular monitoring of renal function for patients with HIV during follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3121756637,"There is limited data on iron reduction therapy (IRT) after successful allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) for patients with thalassemia major (TM). We present the long term outcome of IRT in 149 patients with TM who underwent aHSCT during January, 2001-December, 2012. The median age was 7 years (range:1–18) and 92 (61.7%) belonged to Pesaro class 3 with a median ferritin at aHSCT of 2480ng/ml (range:866–8921). IRT was reinitiated post-aHSCT at a median of 14 months (range:5–53) post aHSCT with phlebotomy alone in 10 (6.7%) patients or iron chelation alone in 60 (40.3%) patients while 79 (53%) were treated with the combination. Reduction in serum ferritin/month [absolute quantity (ng/ml/month) was as follows: 87 (range:33–195), 130 (range:17–1012) and 147 (range:27.7–1427) in the phlebotomy, chelation and combination therapy groups, respectively (p = 0.038). With a median follow up of 80 months (range:37–182), target ferritin level of &lt;300ng/ml was achieved in 59(40%) while a level &lt;500ng/ml was achieved in 88 patients (59%) in a median duration of 41 months of IRT (range: 3–136). Patients in class III risk category and higher starting serum ferritin levels (&gt;2500ng/ml) were associated with delayed responses to IRT. Our data shows that IRT may be needed for very long periods in ex-thalassaemics to achieve target ferritin levels and should therefore be carefully planned and initiated as soon as possible after aHSCT. A combination of phlebotomy and iron chelators is more effective in reducing iron overload."
https://openalex.org/W3123216813,"To assess the objective and subjective image quality, and respiratory motion of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) using the contrast-enhanced four-dimensional dual-energy computed tomography (CE-4D-DECT). For twelve patients, the virtual monochromatic image (VMI) derived from the CE-4D-DECT with the highest contrast to noise ratio (CNR) was determined as the optimal VMI (O-VMI). To assess the objective and subjective image quality, the CNR and five-point score of the O-VMI were compared to those of the standard VMI at 77 keV (S-VMI). The respiratory motion of the PVTT and diaphragm was measured based on the exhale and inhale phase images. The VMI at 60 keV yielded the highest CNR (4.8 ± 1.4) which was significantly higher ( p = 0.02) than that in the S-VMI (3.8 ± 1.2). The overall image quality (4.0 ± 0.6 vs 3.1 ± 0.5) and tumor conspicuity (3.8 ± 0.8 vs 2.8 ± 0.6) of the O-VMI determined by three radiation oncologists was significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.01) than that of the S-VMI. The diaphragm motion in the L-R (3.3 ± 2.5 vs 1.2 ± 1.1 mm), A-P (6.7 ± 4.0 vs 1.6 ± 1.3mm) and 3D (8.8 ± 3.5 vs 13.1 ± 4.9 mm) directions were significantly larger ( p &lt; 0.05) compared to the tumor motion. The improvement of objective and subjective image quality was achieved in the O-VMI. Because the respiratory motion of the diaphragm was larger than that of the PVTT, we need to be pay attention for localizing target in radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3124155184,"Risk stratification by index colonoscopy is well established for first surveillance endoscopy, but whether the previous two colonoscopies affect the subsequent advanced neoplasias has not been established. Therefore, the subsequent risk based on the findings of the index and first surveillance colonoscopies were investigated. This retrospective, cohort study was conducted in two clinics and included participants who had undergone two or more colonoscopies after index colonoscopy. High-risk was defined as advanced adenoma (≥ 1 cm, or tubulovillous or villous histology, or high-grade dysplasia). Based on the findings of the index and first surveillance colonoscopies, patients were classified into four categories: category A (both colonoscopy findings were normal), category B (no high-risk findings both times), category C (one time high-risk finding), and category D (high-risk findings both times). The incidence of subsequent advanced neoplasia was examined in each category. A total of 13,426 subjects were included and surveyed during the study periods. The subjects in category D had the highest risk of advanced neoplasia (27.4%, n = 32/117). The subjects in category A had the lowest risk (4.0%, n = 225/5,583). The hazard ratio for advanced neoplasia of category D compared to category A was 9.90 (95% Confidence interval 6.82–14.35, P&lt;0.001). Classification based on the findings of index and first surveillance colonoscopies more effectively stratifies the risk of subsequent advanced neoplasia, resulting in more proper allocation of colonoscopy resources after two consecutive colonoscopies."
https://openalex.org/W3122148145,"One principle of tuberculosis control is to prevent the development of tuberculosis disease by treating individuals with latent tuberculosis infection. The diagnosis of latent infection using the tuberculin skin test is not straightforward because of concerns about immunologic cross reactivity with the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine and environmental mycobacteria. To parse the effects of BCG vaccine and environmental mycobacteria on the tuberculin skin test, we estimated the frequency distribution of skin test results in two divisions of Kampala, Uganda, ten years apart. We then used mixture models to estimate parameters for underlying distributions and defined clinically meaningful criteria for latent infection, including an indeterminate category. Using percentiles of two underlying normal distributions, we defined two skin test readings to demarcate three ranges. Values of 10 mm or greater contained 90% of individuals with latent infection; values less than 7.2 mm contained 80% of individuals without infection. Contacts with values between 7.2 and 10 mm fell into an indeterminate zone where it was not possible to assign infection. We conclude that systematic tuberculin skin test surveys within populations at risk, combined with mixture model analysis, may be a reproducible, evidence-based approach to define meaningful criteria for latent tuberculosis infection."
https://openalex.org/W3124475706,"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) has emerged as a clinically important neurotropic virus following poliovirus eradication. Recent studies have shown that human tonsillar epithelial cell lines (UT-SCC-60A and UT-SCC-60B) were susceptible to EV-A71, suggesting that human tonsillar crypt epithelium could be important in EV-A71 pathogenesis. However, the mechanism about how EV-A71 infects the upper oro-digestive tract remains largely unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that the human tonsillar epithelial cells infected with EV-A71 underwent apoptotic, in which cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria to the cytosol and caspase-9 was activated, while caspase-2 and -8 were not cleaved or activated during the infection. A selective inhibitor of caspase-9, Z-LEHD-FMK, inhibited the cleavage of the executioner caspase-3 and -7, indicating that only mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway was activated in EV-A71-infected tonsillar epithelial cells. No evidence of pyroptosis or necroptosis was involved in the cell death. EV-A71 infection induced interferon, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IFN-β, IL-6, CCL5, and TNF-α in tonsillar epithelial cells, which may play a critical role in EV-A71-caused herpangina. Our data indicated that the induction of the cytokines was partially regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway. The findings unveiled the host response to EV-A71 and its regulation mechanism, and will further our understanding the significance about the tonsillar crypt epithelium as the initial and primary portal in viral pathogenesis for EV-A71 infection."
