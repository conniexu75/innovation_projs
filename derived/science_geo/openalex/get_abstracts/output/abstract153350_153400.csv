Both three-dimensional structures show the typical nuclear receptor fold. The change of two residues in the ligand-binding pocket between the human progesterone receptor and hAR is most likely the source for the specificity of R1881 to the hAR. The structural implications of the 14 known mutations in the ligand-binding pocket of the hAR ligand-binding domains associated with either prostate cancer or the partial or complete androgen receptor insensitivity syndrome were analyzed. The effects of most of these mutants could be explained on the basis of the crystal structure.

In addition, AR and PR are members of a group of four closely related steroid receptors including the mineralocorticoid receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor recognizing the same hormone response element. In general, steroid receptors are comprised of five to six domains and act as ligand-activated transcription factors that control the expression of specific genes. To date, no experimentally determined three-dimensional structure is available for a complete receptor. During the past few years, x-ray structures have been published for two of the domains, the DNA-binding domain as well as for a number of ligand-binding domains (LBD) including LBD·ligand complexes of the estrogen receptor α and β, the PR, the vitamin D receptor, the retinoic acid receptors (X,RXR; acid, RAR), the thyroid hormone receptor, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (1Moras D.

Despite the low sequence homology of as low as 20% between the LBDs of different nuclear receptor families, all these proteins share a similar fold. They are comprised of up to 12 helices and a small β-sheet arranged in a so-called α-helical sandwich, a kind of fold that up to now has only been observed for the LBDs of nuclear receptors. Depending on the nature of the bound ligand, agonist, or antagonist, the carboxyl-terminal helix H12 is found in either one of two orientations. In the agonist-bound conformation, helix H12 serves as a “lid” to close the ligand-binding pocket (LBP), whereas in the antagonist-bound conformation helix H12 is positioned in a different orientation thus opening the entrance to the LBP. Androgens and their receptors play an important role in male physiology and pathology. AR binds the male sex steroids, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone (14Teutsch G. Goubet F. Battmann T. Bonfils A. Bouchoux F. Cerede E. Gofflo D. Kelly M.G. Philibert D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and regulates genes for male differentiation and development. Therefore, mutations in the androgen receptor gene may lead to several disease states like prostate cancer (PC) or the androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). In males, defects in the AR gene result in a spectrum of developmental abnormalities ranging from a phenotypic female to varying degrees of incomplete genital phenotype. These mutations are well documented in the Androgen Receptor Gene Mutations Data Base of the Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research (15Gottlieb B. Lehvaslaiho H. Beitel L.K. Lumbroso R. Pinsky L. Trifiro M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this study we present the crystal structure of the human hAR LBD in complex with the ligand metribolone (R1881) in comparison with the crystal structure of the human hPR LBD in complex with the same ligand. AR and PR belong to the same steroid receptor subfamily and share a 54% LBD sequence identity (Fig. 1). A number of different ligands bind with similar binding affinities to both receptors (14Teutsch G. Goubet F. Battmann T. Bonfils A. Bouchoux F. Cerede E. Gofflo D. Kelly M.G. Philibert D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure analysis of both receptors in complex with the same ligand (R1881, Fig.2) should increase our understanding of ligand specificities. Furthermore, the analysis of published mutant data on the basis of the hAR LBD crystal structure might give us a deeper insight into AR-related diseases.Figure 2Numbering scheme of R1881 (top) and progesterone (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The cDNAs coding for hAR and hPR were obtained from the groups of A. Cato (Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany) and P. Chambon (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France), respectively. The LBDs of the hAR (amino acid residues 663–919) and the hPR (amino acid residues 677–933) were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction technology using the appropriate primers and cloned into a pGEX-KG vector (16Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 202: 293-298Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion proteins consisted of a glutathione S-transferase, containing a carboxyl-terminal thrombin cleavage site, optimized by a glycine-rich “kinker” region followed by the corresponding LBD. The constructs were then transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Fermentation using the corresponding rec E. coli strains expressing hAR LBD was carried out in 2X YT medium in the presence of ampicillin (200 μg/ml) supplemented with 10 μm R1881. Expression was induced with 30 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, and the fermentation (10 liters) was continued at 15 °C for 14–16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted twice in a continuous high pressure homogenizer (9000PSI) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 100 μm R1881, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mmDTT. All buffers were purged with nitrogen before adding DTT. The supernatants from ultracentrifugation were loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column, washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μm R1881, 0.1% n-octyl-β-glucoside, and 1 mm DTT, and the fusion protein was eluted using the same buffer supplemented with 15 mm reduced glutathione. The eluate was diluted with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μm R1881, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1%n-octyl-β-glucoside up to a fused protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. A thrombin cleavage (2 NIH units/mg fusion protein) was performed overnight at 4 °C. The protein mixture was further diluted 3-fold with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 10 nm R1881, 10 mm DTT, and 0.1%n-octyl-β-glucoside and loaded onto a Fractogel SO3− column and eluted with a gradient of 50–500 mm NaCl in a 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol supplemented with 10 nm R1881, 10 mm DTT, and 0.1% n-octyl-β-glucoside. Approximately 2.4 mg of purified hAR LBD were recovered from 1 liter ofE. coli cell cultures. Protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Fermentation and purification of the hPR LBD was performed identically, but a HEPES pH 7.3 buffer was used from the beginning. A model of the hAR LBD was built based on the coordinates of the hPR LBD-progesterone complex (molecule A) (9Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions were made based on the sequence alignment in Fig. 1 using the Insight 98.0 software (MSI Inc., San Diego). Soaking of the initial model and the energy minimization protocols applied are described in detail elsewhere (17Letz M. Bringmann P. Mann M. Mueller-Fahrnow A. Reipert D. Scholz P. Wurtz J.M. Egner U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Both proteins were dialyzed after purification with buffer containing 50 mm HEPES pH 7.2 for hAR LBD or 10 mm HEPES pH 7.2 for hPR LBD, respectively, 10% glycerol, 10 mm DTT, 0.1% n-octyl-β-glucoside, 10 mm R1881, and 150 mmLi2SO4 and were concentrated up to 3 mg/ml for the hPR LBD-R1881 and up to 4.4 mg/ml for the hAR LBD-R1881, respectively. Vapor diffusion method was used at 20 °C for the hAR LBD complex and at 4 °C for hPR LBD complex. Crystallization experiments had to be set up immediately after concentration. For the hAR LBD·R1881 complex, the reservoir solution contained 0.4 mNa2HPO4·2(H2O), 0.4 mK2HPO4, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1m (NH4)2HPO4, and 5% polyethylene glycol 200. Drops were composed of equal volumes of protein and reservoir solution and were set up using the sitting drop method. Within 2 days crystals appeared and grew to typical dimensions of 50 × 50 × 80 μm3 surrounded by precipitate. Crystals were flash-frozen using a cryoprotecting solution of 60% polyethylene glycol 400 in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Data were collected from one crystal at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) at beam line ID14-EH4 to a resolution of 2.4 Å. For the hPR LBD·R1881 complex, the reservoir solution contained 10% isopropyl alcohol, and 100 mmsodium citrate in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.5. The hanging drop method was used with a 2:1 ratio of protein and reservoir solution. First crystals appeared after 5 weeks and grew to a size of approximately 160 × 120 × 40 μm3. One crystal was flash frozen using a cryo-protecting solution containing 30% glycerol. Data were collected at beam line BM14 at the ESRF (Grenoble, France) to a resolution of 2.8 Å. Before data collection was complete the crystal decomposed in the x-ray beam. Both data sets were integrated and reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Contrary to the hPR LBD·progesterone complex that crystallizes with one homodimer in the monoclinic space group P21 the hAR LBD crystallizes with one monomer in the orthorhombic space group P212121. The hPR LBD·R1881 complex crystallizes in the same monoclinic space group P21and with similar cell constants as the hPR LBD·progesterone complex. The structure determination for the hAR LBD·R1881 and hPR LBD·R1881 complexes were carried out using the molecular replacement method in AMoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) with the coordinates of the hPR LBD·progesterone complex (Protein Data Bank entry, 1A28 (9Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar)). Clear solutions were obtained for both structures using data between 15.0 and 3.5 Å for the hAR LBD and 12.0 and 3.5 Å for the hPR LBD, respectively. The molecular replacement solution obtained was refined using X-PLOR (20Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar). In all refinements and map calculations with X-PLOR a bulk solvent correction was used, and all low resolution data were included. Prior to the refinement calculations, a random 5% sample of the reflection data was flagged for R-free calculations (21Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). All model interactive visualization and editing was carried out using TURBO (22Roussel A. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Cambillau C. XV International Union of Crystallography Congress. Bordeaux, France1990: 66-67Google Scholar). Refinement started using data up to 3.5 Å, and resolution was gradually extended to 2.4 Å. The model was edited according to the known hAR LBD sequence (23Lubahn D.B. Joseph D.R. Sar M. Tan J. Higgs H.N. Larson R.E. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) using 2 F o − F c and F o − F c maps calculated at 3.2 Å resolution and simulated annealed omit maps.

Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Prior to its inclusion in the model, the electron density for the R1881 ligand was clearly visible in all maps. A model for the ligand was obtained from the Cambridge Structural Data Base entry HMESTR (26Precigoux G. Busetta B. Geoffre S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1981; 37: 291-293Crossref Google Scholar, 27Allen F.H. Bellard S. Brice M.D. Cartwright B. Doubleday A. Higgs H. Hummelink T. Hummelink-Peters B.G. Kennard O. Motherwell W.D.S. Rodgers J.R. Watson D.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1979; 35: 2331-2339Crossref Google Scholar). The XPLOR topology and parameter dictionaries were built using program XPLO2D (28Kleywegt G.J. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1995; 31: 45-50Google Scholar). In the final refinement at 2.4 Å, 26 water molecules were included in the model, and individual restrained B-factors were refined for all non-hydrogen atoms. The final values of R andR-free were 21.0 and 29.7%, respectively. TheR-free/R ratio is only slightly smaller than expected (29Tickle I.J. Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Bulk solvent scaling ofF o and F c was applied based on Tronrud's solvent correction, and all available data with no ς cutoffs were used. All map calculations were done including calculatedF values for missing reflections. To avoid model bias, calculated maps using only F o were checked. After the first refinement step the SigmaA-weighted calculated 2 F o − F c andF o − F c maps were inspected using the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar), and electron density of the ligand was clearly observed. The ligand was built up in SYBYL 6.5 (Tripos Inc.) and was included in further refinement steps. A dictionary file for distance restraints for the R1881 molecule was prepared using MAKEDICT (32Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). Towards the end of the refinement, only one water molecule in the LBP of molecule A was added due to the low resolution and missing data. The final model comprises 4027 protein atoms, 42 ligand atoms, and 1 water molecule with final R values ofr = 21.7% and R-free = 34.3%, respectively. A summary of the refinement and model statistics is included in Table II. Coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (33Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams Jr., G.J.B.

Protein Data Bank accession codes are 1e3gfor hAR LBD-R1881 and 1e3k for hPR LBD-R1881. GlutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins can be expressed to very high levels in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (16Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 202: 293-298Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This system was used successfully for the production of the hPR LBD (9Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and hAR LBD. The expression of soluble fusion proteins strongly depends on the presence of ligand in the cells during fermentation (data not shown). During cell disruption, purification, and concentration, any protein oxidation was avoided by purging all buffers with nitrogen and by using DTT as an antioxidant. Fusion proteins were purified by the use of glutathione-Sepharose and subsequently cleaved with thrombin. Cation exchange chromatography yielded purified LBDs. Concentration was performed with a nitrogen pressure diafiltration system. The model and the crystal structures of the hAR LBD are very similar with respect to their overall structure, the LBP and the ligand orientation. The root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation between 149 equivalent Cα atoms in helices between the model and crystal structure of the hAR LBD is 1.09 Å. It is comparable to the r.m.s. deviation of 0.84 Å between the crystal structures of the hAR LBD and the hPR LBD·progesterone complex. The most striking difference between the model and the crystal structure was found in helix H6, where an α-helix was identified in the crystal structure in this region, whereas in the hPR LBD·progesterone complex (molecule A) no α-helix is observed. The ligand orientation in both the hAR LBD-R1881 model and crystal structure is very similar, and the same hydrogen bonds are found. Both crystal structures were analyzed with PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and their stereochemical quality parameters were within their respective confidence intervals. In the Ramachandran (36Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar) ϕ,φ plot, 87.7% for the hAR LBD-R1881 and 85% for the hPR LBD-R1881 structures, respectively, lie within the most favored regions. For the hAR LBD·R1881 complex no residue is outside the normally allowed regions, whereas in the hPR LBD·R1881 complex two residues are located in disallowed regions (Asn705 and Ser793 in molecule A), and three residues (Thr796 in molecule A and Asn705 and Ser793 in molecule B) are located in generously allowed regions. These residues are not involved in ligand binding and are located in loop regions that are most probably not involved in ligand recognition. In the hAR LBD-R1881 structure there is only one close contact (2.6 Å) between Met895 and Ala896carbonyl oxygens. In the hPR LBD-R1881 structure some close contacts were observed, but due to the resolution and completeness of the data this is not surprising. The overall fold of the hAR and hPR LBD-R1881 structures is very similar and also with that of hPR LBD complexed with progesterone (9Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). On the basis of the secondary structure calculated with PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) according to Kabsch and Sander (37Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (11986) Google Scholar), the hAR LBD-R1881 structure contains 9 α-helices, two 310helices, and four short β-strands associated in two anti-parallel β-sheets. The helices are arranged in the typical “helical sandwich” pattern as in hPR LBD·progesterone complex (9Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), and helices H4, H5, H10, and H11 are contiguous. In hAR LBD-R1881 helix H12 seems to be split into two shorter helical segments, with nine and five residues each, respectively. This observation was not seen in the hPR LBD-R1881 structure, although a bending of helix H12 is also seen here. Fig. 1 shows a comparison between the amino acid sequences of hAR LBD and hPR LBD. A ribbon diagram of the hAR LBD-R1881 structure is shown in Fig. 3 along with a superimposed Cα trace of the hAR LBD-R1881 and hPR LBD-R1881 molecules. The crystal structure coordinates of hAR LBD-R1881 were superimposed with those of hPR LBD-R1881 (molecule A) and hPR LBD-progesterone (molecule A) using LSQKAB (38Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). For the superposition the main chain atoms except three amino-terminal (Cys669-Pro671) and one carboxyl-terminal (Thr918) residues were used. The r.m.s. coordinate deviations were 1.16 and 1.22 Å, respectively, again an indication of the similarity of the overall fold of these three molecules. In hAR LBD-R1881, Cys669 and Cys844 are very close, and a disulfide bridge between them was modeled, based on the electron density. However there is no supporting biochemical evidence so far, and it should be noted that the temperature factors of both cysteine residues and the adjacent residues are very high. A cispeptide bond is found at position Pro849 in hAR LBD-R1881. The model of the hAR LBD which is based on the hPR LBD·progesterone complex is very similar to the hAR LBD crystal structure with respect to the overall fold and ligand orientation but shows a stronger bending of helices H10 and H11. Our model structure differs from other published models (39Yong E.L. Tut T.G. Ghadessy F.J. Prins G. Ratnam S.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 137: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with respect to the secondary structure alignment. The secondary structure assignment by Yong et al. (39Yong E.L. Tut T.G. Ghadessy F.J. Prins G. Ratnam S.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 137: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as compared with the hAR LBD crystal structure is similar between helices H3 and H10 but differs most for helices H11, H12, and the additional helix at the carboxyl-terminal end. There are a total of 18 amino acid residues in hAR LBD and hPR LBD that interact with the bound ligand (either R1881 or progesterone). These residues are highlighted in Fig. 1 and included in Fig. 4. Most of these residues are hydrophobic and interact mainly with the steroid scaffold, whereas a few are polar and may form hydrogen bonds to the polar atoms in the ligand. The hydrogen-bonding scheme to O-3 of R1881 and progesterone is similar but not identical, as shown in Fig. 4. In the hAR LBD-R1881 crystal structure, this oxygen atom forms a hydrogen bond to Arg752(Arg766 in hPR LBD), but in contrast with the hPR LBD·progesterone complex the distance of 3.9 Å to Gln711(Gln725 in hPR LBD) does not allow a hydrogen bond. There is a water molecule near O-3 that is hydrogen-bonded to three other residues with a nearly triangular geometry (Arg752Nη1, Met745 O, and Gln711 Oε1 in hAR LBD; Arg766 Nη1, Met759 O, and Gln725 Oε1 in hPR LBD-progesterone). Two of these residues are acceptors; therefore, a third acceptor atom (O-3 in either progesterone or R1881) in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the triangle is unlikely, also due to unfavorable geometry. The water molecule hydrogen-bonded to Gln711 Nε2 in hAR LBD (Gln725 in hPR LBD) has hydrogen bonds to two other residues (Val685 O and Phe764 O in hAR LBD, Ile699 O and Phe777 O in hPR LBD), and in hAR LBD it is hydrogen-bonded to a further water molecule, the overall hydrogen bond geometry being distorted tetrahedral. In the hPR LBD-R1881 structure, the ligands in molecules A and B possess slightly different hydrogen bond patterns. In molecule A, O-3 of R1881 forms two hydrogen bonds (3.2 Å to Gln725Nε2 and 2.9 Å to Arg766Nη2). One water molecule was located in theF o − F c electron density w"

J. (1996) Neurosci. Lett. 209, 57–60). The role of 14-3-3 in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis is not known. In this study, we found that the 14-3-3ζ isoform is associated with tau in brain extract and profoundly stimulates cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzed in vitro phosphorylation on Ser262/Ser356 located within the microtubule-binding region of tau. 14-3-3ζ binds to both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated tau, and the binding site is located within the microtubule-binding region of tau. From brain extract, 14-3-3ζ co-purifies with microtubules, and tubulin blocks 14-3-3ζ-tau binding. Among four 14-3-3 isoforms tested, β and ζ but not γ and ε associate with tau. Our data suggest that 14-3-3ζ is a tau protein effector and may be involved in the abnormal tau phosphorylation occurring during Alzheimer's disease ontogeny.

Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The appearance of neurofibrillary tangles correlates spatially and temporally with Alzheimer's disease severity (2Baak H. Baak E Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11423) Google Scholar). Neurofibrillary tangles are composed mostly of paired helical filaments (PHFs).1 The principle component of PHFs is microtubule-associated protein tau (3Lee V.M.-Y. Balin B.J. Otvos L. Trojanowski J.Q. Science. 1991; 251: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar, 4Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). PHF-tau (tau associated with PHFs) is abnormally phosphorylated (contains more phosphate than normal tau), has reduced mobility on SDS-gel, and is incapable of performing its microtubule-related function (1Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 460-465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 3Lee V.M.-Y. Balin B.J. Otvos L. Trojanowski J.Q.

Dephosphorylated PHF-tau has normal migration on SDS-gel and binds and promotes microtubule assembly in vitro (5Alonso A.D.C. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is thought that abnormal phosphorylation causes loss of tau function, microtubule instability, PHF formation, and neurodegeneration. Abnormal tau phosphorylation has been suggested to be the key event in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology (1Goedert M.

The abnormally phosphorylated PHF-tau contains 5–9 mol of phosphate/mol of tau, whereas tau isolated from normal brain contains 2–3 mol of phosphate/mol of tau (7Kopek E. Tung Y.-C Shaikh S. Alonso A.del C. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24374-24384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo normal adult tau is phosphorylated on Thr181, Ser202, Thr231, Ser262, and Ser404 (all tau residues are numbered according to the longest isoform of human tau (8Goedert M. Spillantini M.G.

Similarly, fetal tau is phosphorylated on all of the above sites plus Ser198, Ser199, Thr217, Ser235, Ser396, and Ser400 (9Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K.

PHF-tau on the other hand is phosphorylated on 19 sites (Table I). Thus, PHF-tau is phosphorylated to a higher extent in terms of stoichiometry and sites. Aberrant activation of a tau-specific kinase(s) has been suggested to be involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis (1Goedert M.

Several kinases phosphorylate tau in vitro. These kinases include neuronal Cdc2-like protein kinase (NCLK), mitogen-activated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, microtubule affinity-regulating kinase, phosphorylase kinase, protein kinase C, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2, casein kinase 1 and 2, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) (11Paudel H.K.

Thus, kinases that phosphorylate Ser198, Ser208, Ser210, Thr403, Ser412, Ser413, and Ser422 are yet to be identified.

Horm. 1996; 52: 149-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There are nine isoforms of 14-3-3. These isoforms are α, β, γ, ε, ζ, τ, ς, δ, and η. The α and δ isoforms are phosphorylated forms of β and ζ, whereas τ and ς are expressed only in T and epithelial cells, respectively. Originally, 14-3-3 was described as the activator of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases (22Ichimura T. Isabe T. Okuyama T. Takahashi N. Araki K. Kuwano R. Takahashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, 14-3-3 plays important roles in the regulation of diverse cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle, apoptosis, exocytosis, and neurotransmitter biosynthesis (20–35). Recently, 14-3-3 was found to be associated with neurofibrillary tangles (36Layfield R. Fergusson J. Aitken A. Lowe J. Landon M. Mayer R.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 209: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The role of 14-3-3 in PHF formation is not known. In this study, we have investigated the effect of 14-3-3ζ on tau phosphorylation. Herein we report that 14-3-3ζ is associated with tau in brain extract and stimulates tau phosphorylation. Our data suggest that 14-3-3ζ is an effector of tau phosphorylation. Nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were employed to produce human 14-3-3ζ cDNA. First, Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) PCR (30 cycles) was carried out using the outer primer pair (5′-AAA AAG AAC ATC CAG TCA-3′ and 5′-TAG CAA AAA TAA TGA AAG-3′) and a human cDNA library (CLONTECH) as template for 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 51 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was purified and used as template for the second PCR (25 cycles), which was performed as above using the inner primer pair (5′-GGA TCC ATG GAT AAA AAT GAG CTG GTT-3′ and 5′-ACC AGT ATG TAG GCA GTT TTC-3′). After the second PCR, Taq polymerase was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was incubated at 72 °C for 10 min. The final PCR product was isolated and ligated into a pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) and amplified. The DNA insert was excised from pGEM-T Easy Vector and ligated into the BamHI/EcoRI cloning sites of pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) bacterial expression vector. The cDNA was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Recombinant GST (glutathioneS-transferase)-14-3-3ζ was purified from bacterial lysates. The overnight bacterial culture was diluted 20 fold in fresh medium and incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. After 2 h, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce protein synthesis, and shaking continued for another 3 h. The bacterial culture was centrifuged, and the pellet was suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm EDTA) containing 1% Tween 20, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin. The suspended bacterial pellet was sonicated for 30 s with a probe sonicator and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against lysis buffer for 2 h and mixed with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The beads were shaken end-over-end for 3 h and packed in a glass column. The column was washed with a 20-column volume of lysis buffer and eluted with 10 mmreduced glutathione in lysis buffer. Eluted GST-14-3-3ζ was concentrated, dialyzed against lysis buffer, and stored frozen until used. Tau and the tau deletion mutants Tau-(1–244), Tau-(245–369), and Tau-(245–441), containing tau residues 1–244, 245–369, and 245–441, respectively, were purified from respective bacterial lysates as described (37Sobue K.

Each bacterial lysate was heated in a boiling water bath and centrifuged, and the supernatant was chromatographed through Q Sepharose followed by S-Sepharose columns as described (37Sobue K.

Microtubules were purified from fresh bovine brain extract by three cycles of microtubule assembly and disassembly (37Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Wei L. Wei S. Miura Y. Paudel H.K. J. Biol.

Protein kinase A catalytic subunit and its peptide substrate kemptide were purchased from Sigma. NCLK peptide substrate (KTPKKAKKPKTPKKAKKL) was synthesized at the peptide synthetic facility of the University of Calgary. Monoclonal anti-14-3-3ε was from Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal antibodies against ζ, γ, and β 14-3-3 isoforms were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-tau antibody that cross-reacts with phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated tau equally was raised at the antibody facility of the University of Calgary. Monoclonal antibody Tau-1 was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Monoclonal antibodies PHF-1 and 12E8 were gifts from Dr. Peter Davis (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York) and Ruth N. Motter (Athena Neurosciences), respectively. Glutathione-agarose beads (50 μl each) coated with GST or GST-14-3-3ζ were mixed with 500 μl of brain extract (∼1 mg/ml protein in buffer A (25 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 15 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40)) or tau solution (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, and 20 μg/ml indicated tau species) for 3 h at 4 °C with end-over-end shaking. Beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm DTT. Washed beads were mixed with 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled, and centrifuged, and 10 μl was immunoblotted with anti-tau antibody. Tau was mixed with GST or GST-14-3-3ζ in a vial and preincubated for 15 h at 4 °C with end-over-end shaking. The concentrations of various components in the preincubation mixture were 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 30 μg/ml GST-14-3-3ζ, and 0.2 mg/ml tau or 100 μmpeptide substrate. To 80 μl of each preincubated mixture, 10 μl of protein kinase A or NCLK was added. Phosphorylation was then initiated by adding 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP/Mg2+ to each mixture. The final concentrations of various components in the assay were 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 24 μg/ml GST-14-3-3ζ, 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 units/ml NCLK or 10 μg/ml protein kinase A, and 0.16 mg/ml tau or 80 μm peptide substrate. To determine tau phosphorylation, aliquots (10 μl each) were withdrawn after the indicated time point, mixed with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS gel. The gel was stained and destained, and the tau band was sliced out from the gel and counted in a liquid scintillation counter to determine the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the protein. Peptide phosphorylation activities of NCLK and A kinase were measured by filter paper assay (16Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Brain extract (∼0.5 ml) containing ∼1 mg/ml protein in buffer A was precleared with 25 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) pre-equilibrated in buffer A and divided into equal halves. To each half, 25 μl of either preimmune serum or anti-tau antiserum was added, and both halves were shaken end-over-end at 4 °C. After 4 h of shaking, 25 μl of protein A-agarose beads pre-equilibrated in buffer A were added to each half, and shaking continued for another 1 h. Protein A-agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed five times with ice-cold buffer A, and immunoblotted using the indicated anti-14-3-3 antibody. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed essentially as described (16Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1777-1785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. NCLK concentration was based on units (11Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of protein kinase A and kemptide were based on dry weights. Concentration of NCLK peptide substrate was determined by amino acid analysis. When tau was phosphorylated by protein kinase A in the presence of GST-14-3-3ζ, tau phosphorylation progressively increased with an increasing GST-14-3-3ζ concentration (Fig.1 A). At 30 μg/ml GST-14-3-3ζ concentration, the maximum tau phosphorylation was observed. When a similar experiment was performed using GST in place of GST-14-3-3ζ, tau phosphorylation remained unaffected (data not shown). These observations indicated that 14-3-3ζ stimulates tau phosphorylation by protein kinase A. 14-3-3ζ may stimulate tau phosphorylation by activating protein kinase A. Alternatively, 14-3-3ζ may make tau a better kinase substrate. To examine these possibilities, we tested the effect of GST-14-3-3ζ on kemptide phosphorylation by protein kinase A. As shown in Fig. 1 B, GST-14-3-3ζ showed no effect on kemptide phosphorylation (open circles) but stimulated tau phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (solid circles). These data suggested that 14-3-3ζ is a tau effector (i.e. makes tau a better substrate of protein kinase A). If 14-3-3ζ acts through tau, it should stimulate tau phosphorylation by other kinases as well. To test this, we examined the effect of GST-14-3-3ζ on tau phosphorylation by NCLK. GST-14-3-3ζagain stimulated tau phosphorylation and had no effect on the synthetic peptide substrate phosphorylation (Fig. 1 C). Control GST showed no effect on both tau or peptide phosphorylation by NCLK (data not shown). Based on these data, we concluded that 14-3-3ζis a tau phosphorylation modulator. In Fig.1, we preincubated tau with various GST-14-3-3ζ amounts for ∼15 h before phosphorylation. To further examine 14-3-3ζ-stimulated tau phosphorylation, we kept GST-14-3-3ζ concentration constant and preincubated tau and GST-14-3-3ζ mixture for different time points. Each preincubated tau species was phosphorylated by NCLK or protein kinase A. GST-14-3-3ζ displayed very little effect on tau phosphorylation by NCLK when tested without any preincubation. The stimulatory effect of GST-14-3-3ζ became apparent after ∼2 h preincubation. At the ∼10-h preincubation time point, the stimulatory effect peaked and remained constant during the next 24 h, the maximum time point tested (data not included). NCLK phosphorylation of control tau species preincubated with GST for various time points remained constant throughout the preincubation time points. Similarly, protein kinase A phosphorylation of tau preincubated with GST-14-3-3ζ increased with increasing preincubation time point, peaked at ∼10 h preincubation time and then remained constant, whereas phosphorylation of tau species preincubated with GST was unaffected by preincubation time (data not shown). These observations indicated that 14-3-3ζ stimulates tau phosphorylation by protein kinase A or NCLK only when the tau-14-3-3ζ mixture is preincubated. Tau phosphorylated by several kinases displays a characteristic reduced mobility on SDS gels (13Scott C.W. Spreen R.C. Herman J.L. Chow F.P. Davison M.D. Young J. Caputo C.B. J. Biol.

Heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of both α and βγ subunits that can signal independently to diverse intracellular signaling pathways including those that activate MAP kinases. In this study, we examined the ability of isoproterenol, an agonist of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), to stimulate extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Using HEK293 cells, which express endogenous β2AR, we show that isoproterenol stimulates ERKs via β2AR. This action of isoproterenol requires cAMP-dependent protein kinase and is insensitive to pertussis toxin, suggesting that Gαs activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is required. Interestingly, β2AR activates both the small G proteins Rap1 and Ras, but only Rap1 is capable of coupling to Raf isoforms. β2AR inhibits the Ras-dependent activation of both Raf isoforms Raf-1 and B-Raf, whereas Rap1 activation by isoproterenol recruits and activates B-Raf. β2AR activation of ERKs is not blocked by expression of RasN17, an interfering mutant of Ras, but is blocked by expression of either RapN17 or Rap1GAP1, both of which interfere with Rap1 signaling. We propose that isoproterenol can activate ERKs via Rap1 and B-Raf in these cells.

Growth factors activate receptor tyrosine kinases to stimulate a number of intracellular signaling cascades. One cascade, the MAP1 kinase (or ERK) cascade triggers cellular proliferation through multiple mechanisms including inducing stimulation of progression through the G1/S transition of the cell cycle and by activating rate-limiting proteins involved in both DNA and protein synthesis (1Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,2Graves L.M. Guy H.I. Kozlowski P. Huang M. Lazarowski E. Pope R.M. Collins M.A. Dahlstrand E.N. Earp III, H.S. Evans D.R. Nature. 2000; 403: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). ERKs are activated in cancerous cells through the action of proto-oncogenes like ras that lie upstream of the MAP kinase cascade. Hormones can also activate the MAP kinase cascade to stimulate proliferation in many cell types (3Dhanasekaran N. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Endocrine Rev. 1995; 16: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Some hormones, like insulin, act like growth factors to activate receptor tyrosine kinases to stimulate intracellular cascades leading to ERK (4Avruch J. Mol. Cell.

However, most hormones act via serpentine (or seven-transmembrane receptors), and couple to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) to elicit their effects (6Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 7Ginell R.P. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).Heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of two functional units, an α subunit and a βγ subunit. Both α and βγ are released from hormone receptors upon ligand binding and can directly bind to and activate specific effectors. For α, one of these effectors is adenylate cyclase. Historically α subunits that stimulate adenylate cyclase are called αs for stimulatory, whereas those that inhibit adenylate cyclase are termed αi, for inhibitory. Over the past 5 years, cross-talk between G protein-coupled signaling pathways have been identified for many G protein-coupled receptors (3Dhanasekaran N. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L.

Nature. 1999; 400: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) provides the cross-talk necessary to modulate signals to the small G proteins Ras or Rap1, respectively, to regulate the MAP kinase cascade.Perhaps the best studied mechanism of cross-talk between G proteins and the MAP kinase cascade involves the βγ subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. Activation of both Gq- and Gi-coupled receptors releases βγ to activate the tyrosine kinase c-Src, which can activate Ras via the phosphorylation of the adaptor molecule Shc, which then recruits a complex consisting of Grb2 and SOS, the Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), to the membrane where it can activate Ras (20Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12133-12136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In some cases, a role for phosphoinositol 3-kinase γ in Src activation has been shown (21Lopez-Llasaca M. Crespo P. Pellicci P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In other cases, Src is activated by a calcium-sensitive kinase PYK2 (12Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Despite variations on the mechanisms used, all examples of βγ signaling to ERKs require Ras activation.Recently, the α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins have also been shown to signal to the MAP kinase cascade. The α subunits of Gi and Go (which share extensive sequence homology and PTx sensitivity) both bind to Rap1GAP1, aGTPase-activating protein specific for a distinct small G protein Rap1 (19Mochizuki N.

Rap1 is a cell type-specific antagonist of Ras-dependent signaling, and its inhibition by Rap1GAP1 can allow Ras to signal effectively to ERKs. The α subunit of Gs has also been implicated in MAP kinase activation. For example, constitutively activated mutants of Gαs are oncogenic (22Landis C. Masters S. Spada A. Pace A. Bourne H. Vallar L. Nature. 1989; 340: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 23Lyons J. Landis C.A. Harsh G. Vallar L. Grunewald K. Feichtinger H. Duh Q.Y. Clark O.H. Kawasaki E. Bourne H.R. McCormack F.

Activated Gαs triggers the synthesis of the second messenger cAMP through direct association with specific adenylate cyclases (26Masters S.B. Sullivan K.A. Miller R.T. Beiderman B. Lopez N.G.

Therefore, in B-Raf-expressing cells, cAMP has at least two potential mechanisms to activate ERKs through Ras-independent pathways, one via PKA and another through direct activation of Rap1-GEFs.The ability of hormones that couple to Gαs to activate Rap1 and ERKs has been examined in transfected cell lines overexpressing specific serpentine receptors. In Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the adenosine A2A receptor, adenosine has been shown to activate ERKs via Rap1 (39Seidel M.G. Klinger M. Freissmuth M. Holler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25833-25841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells, a well studied model of G protein coupling, overexpression of β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) was shown to couple to ERKs via a Ras-dependent pathway (40Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T.

Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The best studied receptor system coupled to Gαs is the β2AR and its activation by the agonist isoproterenol. In this study, we examine the mechanism by which isoproterenol activates ERKs in HEK293 cells expressing endogenous levels of β2AR.DISCUSSIONThe second messenger cAMP is the best studied intracellular signal. Its major action, the activation of PKA (28Butcher R.W. Robison G.A. Hardman J.G. Sutherland E.W. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1968; 6: 357-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1975; 5: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar) allows hormonal signals to couple to intracellular phosphorylation events. Hormonal elevation of cAMP levels is triggered by the specific heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gαs. The range of extracellular ligands that couple to Gαs is extensive and includes moderately sized peptides, including vasoactive intestinal peptide-like, members of the glucagon/secretin superfamily, adrenocorticotropic hormone, parathyroid stimulating hormone, and a large family of hypothalamic releasing factors, as well as the family of large glycoproteins thyroid stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone. Small molecules can also activate Gs to stimulate adenylate cyclases, including dopamine (via the D1 receptor), adenosine (via the A2A receptor), prostaglandin E, and the family of adrenergic molecules, including epinephrine and norepinephrine (58Spiegel A.M.

Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The cognate receptors for all these ligands are heptahelical transmembrane proteins (also called serpentine receptors) that associate with Gαs.In the unliganded, resting state, these receptors bind inactive GDP-bound Gαs subunits that are associated with specific βγ subunits. Upon ligand binding, exchange of GTP for GDP converts α into its active GTP-bound state, causing it to be released from the receptor, where it is free to bind to, and activate, membrane-associated adenylate cyclases. At the same time that Gαs dissociates from the receptor, βγ is released from Gαs and can activate effectors independently of Gαs. βγ signaling from Gs-coupled receptors has not been reported. However, βγ release from Gi and Gq is well known to activate a number of intracellular kinases, including phosphoinositol 3-kinase (20Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Endocrine Rev. 1995; 16: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The best studied actions of cAMP on ERK signaling are inhibitory and lead to a decrease in cellular proliferation (30Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W.

This is achieved, in part, by a PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the MAP kinase kinase kinase Raf-1 on serine 43, which uncouples Raf-1 from its upstream activator Ras (30Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). In cells that express the Raf isoform B-Raf (which does not contain a PKA site corresponding to serine 43), cAMP can activate ERKs (9Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S.

Although this has been shown in multiple cell types, additional factors may influence cAMPs ability to activate B-Raf. Indeed, cAMP has also been reported to inhibit the activation of B-Raf through a PKA phosphorylation near the kinase domain itself. However, this effect is only seen in truncated proteins lacking the N terminus of B-Raf (64MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13193-13197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In cells that express a truncated splice variant of B-Raf that also lacks the N terminus, cAMPs inhibitory effects may predominate (65Vaillancourt R.R. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6522-6530Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, cAMP robustly activates the full-length B-Raf protein, which is achieved via the activation of the small G protein Rap1 (9Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S.

Recently, Rap1 activators have been identified that can be directly activated by cAMP, suggesting that cAMP can activate Rap1 via both PKA-dependent and PKA-independent mechanisms (37Kawasaki H.

The ability of β2AR to inhibit ERK signals has been demonstrated in adipocytes (32Sevetson B.R. Kong X. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

In this study, we show that β2AR can activate ERKs in HEK293 cells by activating a Rap1/B-Raf pathway, while simultaneously blocking Ras-dependent signals.HEK293 cells are commonly used to examine signaling pathways downstream of transfected receptors (39Seidel M.G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We show that these cells express endogenous β2AR and upon isoproterenol stimulation utilize β2AR to activate ERKs. This activation shows an EC50 of roughly 1–3 μm, consistent with other actions of isoproterenol, and is rapid and transient (43Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Its actions on ERKs are mimicked by forskolin and require PKA, suggesting the involvement of Gαs and cAMP. Although signaling via Gαs is classically thought to be insensitive to PTx, recent reports have demonstrated that β2AR can couple to ERKs via PTx-sensitive pathways (41Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). These studies, which utilized transiently transfected cDNAs encoding β2AR in HEK293 cells, proposed a PKA-dependent switch in β2AR affinity from Gs to Gi. In our hands, PTx did not block β2AR's activation of ERKs, while blocking the action of known Gi-coupled agents, including carbachol, lysophosphatidic acid, and clonidine. It is possible that the ability of β2AR to couple to PTx-sensitive pathways is dependent on elevated levels of β2AR expression.Both Ras-dependent and Rap1-dependent mechanisms of β2AR's activation of ERKs have been proposed (35Wan Y. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14533-14537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 40Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Indeed, we show that both Ras and Rap1 were activated by isoproterenol. Ras is activated rapidly and transiently, whereas Rap1 activation is slower and is sustained. This is similar to the kinetics seen in other cell types, including PC12 cells (47York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and in platelets (75Franke B. van Triest M. de Bruijn K.M. van Willigen G. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Negrier C. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activation of Rap1, but not Ras, required PKA. Forskolin, which acts downstream of Gαs to elevate cAMP, also activated Rap1 but did not activate Ras. These data suggest that β2AR utilized distinct pathways to activate Ras and Rap1. We propose that Rap1 is activated by Gαs(via cAMP and PKA), and that Ras is activated independently of Gαs, possibly by a βγ-dependent pathway. For Rap1, PKA appears to act upstream of Rap1 itself, possibly through a mechanism involving the Rap1 guanine-nucleotide exchanger C3G (47York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). C3G is expressed in HEK293 cells and is distinct from recently proposed exchangers like cAMP-GEFs (Epacs) that appear to be activated by cAMP in a PKA-independent manner (37Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 38de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar).Surprisingly, only Rap1, but not Ras, was required for β2AR's activation of ERKs. Two agents that interfere with Rap1 signaling, RapN17 and Rap1GAP1, were used. Overexpression of RapN17 is thought to sequester endogenous activators of Rap1, whereas Rap1GAP1 stimulates the GTPase activity of endogenous Rap1 to terminate Rap1 signaling (9Vossler M. Yao H.

These data suggest that, although both Ras and Rap1 are activated by β2AR, only Rap1 is capable of transmitting a signal to ERKs. The signal to ERKs is likely to be B-Raf, since B-Raf is the only known MAP kinase kinase kinase that can be activated by Rap1. Indeed, HEK293 cells express the 96-kDa isoform of B-Raf that is activated by cAMP (9Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar), and endogenous B-Raf is recruited to Rap1 upon isoproterenol stimulation, in a PKA-dependent manner. Both Raf-1 and B-Raf have been shown to be efficiently recruited to Ras under the appropriate conditions (54Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J.

In bacterial type II systems, the first initiation step in elongation is the condensation of acetyl-CoA with malonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) catalyzed by β-ketoacyl-ACP III (FabH). An open reading frame in theMycobacterium tuberculosis genome (Rv0533c), now termedmtfabH, was 37.3% identical to Escherichia coli ecFabH and contained the Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad signature. However, the purified recombinant mtFabH clearly preferred long-chain acyl-CoA substrates rather than acyl-ACP primers and did not utilize acetyl-CoA as a primer in comparison to ecFabH. In addition, purified mtFabH was sensitive to thiolactomycin and resistant to cerulenin in an in vitro assay. However, mtFabH overexpression in Mycobacterium bovis BCG did not confer thiolactomycin resistance, suggesting that mtFabH may not be the primary target of thiolactomycin inhibition in vivo and led to several changes in the lipid composition of the bacilli. The data presented is consistent with a role for mtFabH as the pivotal link between the type I and type II fatty acid elongation systems inM. tuberculosis. This study opens up new avenues for the development of selective and novel anti-mycobacterial agents targeted against mtFabH."

The currently established role of RGS proteins is to negatively regulate G protein-linked signaling pathways by reducing the lifetime of G proteins in the active GTP-bound state. RGS proteins achieve this by functioning as GAPs for Gα subunits (4Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11924-11927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). RGS proteins are characterized by a homologous 120-amino acid region, referred to as the RGS domain, that is responsible for binding Gα and stimulating its GTPase rate (12Popov S., Yu, K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Faurobert E. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Outside of this RGS domain, however, the more than 30 members of the family are structurally diverse. Other structural elements found in RGS proteins include PDZ, pleckstrin homology, proline-rich, and Dbl-homology (DH) domains, which might mediate subcellular targeting, assemble signaling complexes, or be involved in the regulation of RGS GAP activity (6Hepler J.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 376-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 7De Vries L. Farquhar M.G.

A distinct subfamily of RGS proteins, including RGS6, -7, -9, and -11, contains two unique domains. One is the Disheveled/Egl-10/pleckstrin (DEP) domain, which is found at the N-terminal part of the proteins, and has an unknown function. The other domain is the G protein γ-like (GGL) domain, which is responsible for the specific interaction with the neurospecific G protein β subunit, Gβ5 (14Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M.

Reconstitution of Gβ5 and RGS7 in vitro has shown that Gβ5 preferentially forms a heterodimer with RGS7 over Gγ2 (15Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The dimers of Gβ5 and RGS6, -7, and -11 display GAP activity toward Gαo in vitro, but not other Gα subunits (14Snow B.E.

The Gβ5L-RGS9 complex from photoreceptor outer segments can act as a GAP for Gαt in concert with its effector, the γ subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDEγ) (18Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Importantly, previous work has shown that Gβ5-RGS complexes exist in vivo (18Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, despite the fact that Gβ5 has been shown to interact with Gγ subunits in vitro (21Jones M.B. Garrison J.C. Anal.

Here, we asked if Gβ5 is always complexed with RGS proteins, does it exist as a monomer, or is it associated with Gγ in native tissues. We found that in the cytosol and detergent extracts of membranes from both the retina and brain, Gβ5 exists exclusively as a dimer with RGS. We also demonstrate through co-expression of Gβ5 and RGS7 in cultured cells that a mechanism regulating the stoichiometry of these proteins exists. Furthermore, although Gβ5-RGS complexes do not bind to Gα subunits with high affinity, the complex can inhibit Gαq-mediated signaling through the muscarinic M3 receptor. Polyclonal antisera were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 463–477 of bovine RGS9 by Alpha Diagnostic International. Antibodies against RGS7, Gβ1, and Gβ5 were described previously (15Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1998; 249: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). RGS7 and RGS9 antisera were affinity-purified by passing the serum over a Sulfolink column (Pierce) with covalently attached immunizing peptide. Anti-Gαo antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Allen Spiegel (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), anti-Gαt by Dr. Melvin Simon (Caltech, Pasadena, CA), anti-Gαq by Dr. David Manning (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), anti-PDEγ by Dr. Eva Faurobert (IPMC-CNRS, Valbonne, France), anti-arrestin by Dr. Vsevolod Gurevich (Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ), and anti-phosducin by Dr. Rehwa Lee (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). Antibodies against the various Gγ subunits were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunologicals. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously (15Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Cabrera J.L. de Freitas F. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Visualization of protein bands was performed using ECL reagents obtained from Pierce, Inc. The Gβ5-containing complex was purified from the soluble fraction of bovine retina as described previously (19Cabrera J.L. de Freitas F. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For purification of brain complexes, rat brains were removed from adult female rats and homogenized in 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5 (TEBS). Total brain homogenate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 20 min. at 4 °C. The supernatant was then directly applied to a 5-ml Q-Sepharose column and further resolved on SP-Sepharose. For analysis of the membrane proteins, the pellet was washed twice in ice-cold TEBS buffer. The pellet was then resuspended in TEBS buffer also containing 1% sodium cholate or 1% Genapol C-100. The suspensions were then mixed at 4 °C for 1 h before centrifugation at 50,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was diluted 1:2 using TEBS buffer and loaded onto a 5-ml Q-Sepharose column. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 50 mm to 500 mm in a total volume of 25 ml. Fractions containing Gβ5 and RGS7, as detected by Western blot, were pooled and diluted 4-fold in TEBS buffer without NaCl and applied to a 2-ml SP-Sepharose column and eluted with a 10-ml gradient from 50 to 500 mm NaCl in TEBS. Fractions (500 μl) were collected and analyzed by Western blot. COS-7 monkey kidney cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. 2 × 105 cells/well were plated into 12-well plates 1 day before transfection. 1 μg of total plasmid DNA, typically containing 0.5 μg of Gβ5, RGS7, RGS7Δ (15Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), or LacZ, was mixed with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 200 μl of OPTI-MEM and added to the washed cells. For RGS7, 0.9 μg of plasmid DNA needed to be used to reliably detect the protein using Western blot. Five hours later, the transfection mixture was removed and replaced with 1 ml of 10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM. Twenty-four and 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and assayed by Western blot. All cDNAs were carried by the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The probe used for RNase protection assay was a 350-base pair 3′-terminal fragment of bovine RGS7 cloned into pBluescript KS+ vector (Stratagene). After linearization, antisense [α-32P]UTP-labeled probe was synthesized with Maxiscript T7 kit (Ambion). Full-length transcript was purified by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 murea-Tris borate/EDTA gel. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) from 106 of COS-7 cells 48 h after transfection with pcDNA3 plasmids encoding LacZ, RGS7, and Gβ5. The RNase protection assay was performed with 2–10 μg of total RNA and 80,000 cpm of RGS7 probe using an RPA III kit (Ambion). After hybridization overnight at 45 °C and RNase digestion, separation, and detection of the protected RNA probe was performed by trichloroacetic acid as described by Pham et al. (25Pham K. LaForge K.S. Park S.W. Choi S.-Y. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The protected RNA probe was precipitated with 1 ml of 0.75% sodium pyrophosphate in 5% trichloroacetic acid and 0.025% bovine serum albumin. The precipitated RNA probes were collected onto glass microfiber filters (GFC grade, Whatman) by vacuum filtration. The filters were rinsed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and radioactivity measured in 4 ml of scintillation mixture in a scintillation counter. To verify the integrity of the RNA probe after RNase digestion, an aliquot of the samples were subjected to 5% polyacrylamide electrophoresis and subsequently visualized using autoradiography (BioMax MR, Eastman Kodak Co.). Total RNA (5–15 μg) prepared from transfected COS-7 cells was denatured with glyoxal/dimethyl sulfoxide, resolved on a 1% agarose gel, blotted onto BrightStar-Plus membrane (Ambion), and subsequently hybridized to RGS7-specific [α-32P]UTP-labeled riboprobe prepared as described above. Pre-hybridization was carried out for 30 min at 68 °C in ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion) in hybridization oven. The blot was hybridized with 5 × 106 cpm probe/ml pre-hybridization buffer for 3 h at 68 °C, washed at room temperature for 20 min (twice for 10 min), followed by another 30 min (twice for 15 min) wash at 68 °C. The blot was exposed to autoradiography film (BioMax MR, Kodak). COS-7 cells were transfected with RGS7, Gβ5, RGS7 + Gβ5, or LacZ cDNA constructs as described earlier. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells (3 × 105) were incubated at 37 °C in 60 × 15-mm dishes in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h. A pulse of 200 μCi/dish of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (NEN Life Science Products) was given for 1 h in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. After washing the cells twice using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were chased with serum-free DMEM at 37 °C. The cells were harvested at the indicated times in 500 μl of PBS containing 10 mm EDTA and 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following freeze-thawing, the cells were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatants were then pre-cleared with Protein A-Sepharose beads, and 200 μl of the supernatant was immunoprecipitated using affinity-purified anti-RGS7 antibody (1 μg of IgG/20 μl of Protein A) or anti-Gβ5 antibody for the Gβ5 monomer. After incubating with mixing for 1 h, the beads were washed twice with PBS and then eluted using 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, visualized by autoradiography (BioMax MR, Kodak), and quantified using Scion Image. Bovine retinas were processed according to the procedure for the isolation of transducin as described in detail previously (26Bigay J. Chabre M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 139-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, the retinas were resuspended, in an isotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) containing 45% sucrose. The suspension was passed through cheesecloth and centrifuged. Unsolubilized material was pelleted (P1) at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (S1) was diluted 1:1 in isotonic buffer. Crude rod outer segments (ROS) were collected (P2) by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The crude outer segment (OS) pellet was further subjected to ultracentrifugation on a stepwise sucrose density gradient and the purified OS were recovered at the interface of the 1.115 and 1.135 density gradient steps. The enucleated eye from an euthanized mouse was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. The lens and cornea were removed, and the remaining eyecup was fixed for 1 h. After fixation, the eyecup was rinsed three times, 15 min each, in cold PBS, and infiltrated with 30% sucrose overnight. The next day, the eyecup was embedded in OCT and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and 10-μm cryosections were obtained. The retinal sections were blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% goat serum, and 0.3% Triton X-100. Affinity-purified RGS7 polyclonal antibody was diluted 1:100 in the block solution, applied to the sections, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, after which the sections were washed three times, 5 min each, in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% goat serum. The fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector laboratories) was diluted 1:50 and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After rinsing three times for 5 min each time in PBS, the sections were mounted in Vectashield and viewed under a fluorescent microscope. Protein A-Sepharose beads (15 μl) were washed with TEBS buffer and then incubated on ice with 1 μg of affinity-purified RGS7 or RGS9 antibody for 30 min. After collecting the unbound material, the antibody-containing beads were mixed with 75 μl of either brain or outer segment extract for 1 h on ice. After washing the beads twice with a large volume of TEBS buffer, a third wash using 75 μl was collected for analysis on Western blot. The proteins were eluted using 75 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. For immunoprecipitation of photoreceptor outer segments, the membranes were first solubilized with 60 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma) as described in He et al. (27He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) in either the presence or absence of AMF (25 μm AlCl3, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF). In initial experiments, a control in which pre-immune serum was bound to the Protein A-Sepharose was tested and revealed no binding of RGS and Gβ5 proteins. In subsequent immunoprecipitations, the negative control was extract-mixed with Protein A-Sepharose beads without antibody. CHO cells in six-well plates were either not transfected or transfected with the indicated combinations of cDNAs encoding the human muscarinic M3 receptor (3 μg/well), RGS7 (5 μg/well), and Gβ5 (5 μg/well). Twenty-four hours following transfection, cells were harvested in trypsin/EDTA and re-plated in 96 well plates. Approximately 40 h later, cells were loaded for 1 h at room temperature in a balanced salt solution with 5 μm fluo-3-AM in the presence of 0.2% Pluronic F-127. Cells were washed and subsequently excited at 505 nm with emission recorded at 530 nm as an index of [Ca2+]i using fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) according to standard protocol (28Sullivan E. Tucker E.M. Dale I.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 114: 125-133PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with metacholine 20 s after the monitoring of fluorescence began. Data are presented as arbitrary units of fluorescence. Although complexes of Gβ5 with RGS proteins have been reconstituted in vitro and found in native tissues, Gβ5-Gγ complexes have only been studiedin vitro (21Jones M.B. Garrison J.C. Anal.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In an attempt to detect native Gβ5-Gγ, the Gβ5-containing fraction from the soluble fraction of bovine retina was purified to homogeneity as described previously in Cabrera et al. (19Cabrera J.L. de Freitas F. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This purified sample was analyzed using silver stain and Western blot. As shown previously in Cabrera et al. (19Cabrera J.L. de Freitas F. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), Gβ5 and RGS7 co-migrated throughout the purification. Fig.1 shows that this Gβ5-RGS complex does not contain a Gγ subunit. As a control for the presence of a Gγ subunit, the SDS-PAGE lane with an equivalent amount of purified transducin heterotrimer shows a band characteristic of Gγ1 at approximately 10 kDa. These results show that in the retinal cytosol Gβ5 is bound to RGS and is not associated with Gγ. We reasoned that Gβ5 could exist in a complex with Gγ in certain non-retinal cell types and thus attempted to detect Gβ5-Gγ complexes in brain extracts. Because Gβ5 is found in both soluble and membrane-associated forms (23Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28154-28160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Betty M. Harnish S.W. Rhodes K.J. Cockett M.I. Neuroscience. 1998; 85: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we examined Gβ5 in cytosolic and detergent-extracted membrane fractions of rat brain. Fig.2 A shows that in brain cytosol, similarly to the retina, Gβ5 co-migrates with RGS7 upon consecutive anion- and cation-exchange chromatographies. We previously demonstrated that cation-exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose can be used as an assay for the association of Gβ5 with an RGS (15Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Since the majority of proteins are negatively charged at physiologic pH, at least 90% of proteins in crude extracts do not bind to this matrix. RGS7 and other GGL-containing RGS proteins contain positively charged amino acid clusters, which perhaps interact with the cation-exchanger and allow the Gβ5-RGS complexes to be absorbed. Thus, co-elution of Gβ5 with RGS7 as a single peak through ion-exchange chromatographic steps indicates that they are associated. In some experiments (one of which is represented in Fig. 2 B), a small portion of Gβ5 did not bind SP-Sepharose. However, even if Gβ5 could be detected in the unbound fraction, it represented less than 1% of the total Gβ5. Furthermore, with prolonged development of the Western blots, RGS7 could also be seen in the same sample. In one experiment, we re-loaded the unbound fraction on fresh SP-Sepharose and both Gβ5 and RGS7 then absorbed to the column. This indicates that the small portion of Gβ5 in the unbound fraction is likely due to incomplete absorption on SP-Sepharose due to some variations of experimental conditions rather than Gβ5 existing without an RGS. To confirm the interaction between Gβ5 and RGS7 using an alternative approach, we co-immunoprecipitated Gβ5 with RGS7 using an affinity-purified antibody to RGS7 (Fig. 2 C). Despite the fact that both the immunoprecipitating and detecting antibodies were raised in rabbits, we were able to clearly distinguish the bands for both RGS7 and Gβ5 over the background IgG bands in the Western blots. In all our experiments, a small portion (<10%) of Gβ5 remained in the unbound fraction. This most likely results from Gβ5 being associated with other RGS proteins present in the brain (i.e. RGS6, -9, and -11), that would not bind to the anti-RGS7 antibody. Supporting this interpretation, in photoreceptor outer segments where RGS9 is the only RGS species present, 100% of Gβ5L is immunoprecipitated with RGS9-specific antibody (Fig. 8 A). Thus, two different approaches show that in the cytosolic fraction of the brain, Gβ5 and RGS7 are always present as a complex. We next examined the possibility that a Gβ5-Gγ complex could be present in the brain membrane. It has been shown that some ionic detergents dissociate the recombinant Gβ5-Gγ2 complex, but in the non-ionic detergent Genapol C-100, the dimer remains intact (21Jones M.B. Garrison J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, we extracted the membranes using either sodium cholate or Genapol C-100 to minimize the effect of solubilization on the status of the native Gβ5 complex. Both detergents solubilized Gβ5, RGS7, and Gα subunits from the membranes. The protein extracts were analyzed by chromatography and immunoprecipitation using the protocols developed for the cytosol. Following 10-fold enrichment on Q-Sepharose, the Gβ5-RGS7-containing fractions were pooled and further resolved on SP-Sepharose (Fig.3 A). Chromatography on SP-Sepharose resulted in at least an additional 100-fold purification, and both Gβ5 and RGS7 co-eluted during the procedure. Similarly to the results in Fig. 2 (A and B), regardless of which detergent was used, only a small portion (<1% of total) of Gβ5 could be detected in the unbound fraction in some experiments (Fig. 3 A). The chromatographic behavior of the membrane-bound Gβ5-RGS7 complex suggests that it is essentially identical to the cytosolic form, as well as the reconstituted dimer (15Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Importantly, since neither Gβ1nor Gγ2 bound to SP-Sepharose, Gβ5 is completely resolved from “classic” Gβγ subunits (Fig.3 B). Finally, Gβ5 was immunoprecipitated from the detergent extracts using the anti-RGS7 antibody (Fig.3 C). Recent work by Zhang and Simonds has also shown that Gβ5 and RGS7 can be co-immunoprecipitated (20Zhang J.H. Simonds W.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: RC59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these results, we have to conclude that in brain membranes, as well as in the cytosol, Gβ5 is always present in a dimer with either RGS7 or one of the other GGL-containing RGS proteins.

In vitro binding assays with glutathione S-transferase-paxillin demonstrated an interaction of α-tubulin with the C terminus of paxillin.

The interaction between paxillin and both α- and γ-tubulin in vivo was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from human T lymphoblasts. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that, in adherent T cells, paxillin localized to sites of cell-matrix interaction as well as to a large perinuclear region. Confocal microscopy revealed that this region corresponds to the lymphocyte microtubule organizing center, where paxillin colocalizes with α- and γ-tubulin. The localization of paxillin to this area was observed in cells in suspension as well as during adhesion to integrin ligands. These data constitute the first characterization of the interaction of paxillin with the microtubule cytoskeleton, and suggest that paxillin, in addition to its well established role at focal adhesions, could also be associated with the lymphocyte microtubule network.

Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). These sites, in addition to mediating mechanical linkage between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton, are complex regulatory units that integrate environmental information and intracellular signaling pathways. Focal adhesion proteins customarily have been categorized as either structural molecules, such as the actin-binding proteins tensin, α-actinin and vinculin, or regulatory molecules, including the focal adhesion tyrosine kinase (FAK) and Src (2Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Paxillin is a focal adhesion protein that serves as an adapter molecule, providing docking sites for both structural and regulatory proteins (3Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of paxillin, composed of four LIM domains, mediates paxillin targeting to focal adhesions (4Brown M.C.

A leucine-rich motif that is repeated five times within the N terminus of paxillin binds a protein complex containing the p21 GTPase-activated kinase PAK, the adapter protein Nck, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor PIX, and the new multidomain ARF-GAP protein p95PKL (paxillin kinase linker) (11Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Paxillin expression is not confined to adherent cells in organized tissues. Other cells, such as circulating leukocytes, also express high levels of this protein (3Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In these cells paxillin phosphorylation and association with signaling molecules occurs in response to a variety of stimuli. For example: (i) activation of T cells through CD3 or CD45 induces paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation and association with Lck and Pyk2 (12Ostergaard H.L. Lou O. Arendt C.W. Berg N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5692-5696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), (ii) integrin ligation of NK cells also induces paxillin phosphorylation and association with Pyk2 (13Gismondi A. Bisogno L. Mainiero F. Palmieri G. Piccolo M. Frati L. Santoni A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4729-4736PubMed Google Scholar), (iii) tumor necrosis factor stimulation of neutrophils induces paxillin phosphorylation (14Fuortes M. Jin W.W. Nathan C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and (iv) paxillin interacts directly with the cytoplasmic tail of α4 integrin in Jurkat T cells (15Liu S. Thomas S.M.

The microtubule network of an interphase cell is a dynamic polarized structure. The fast growing plus ends of the microtubules extend toward the cell periphery, whereas relatively stable minus ends are localized to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC), which is typically located at a perinuclear position in cultured cells. This organelle nucleates the assembly and establishes the polarity of microtubules. γ-Tubulin is a specialized member of the tubulin family that localizes to the MTOC and is involved in microtubule nucleation (16Wiese C. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 250-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified an interaction between paxillin and the microtubule cytoskeleton in T lymphocytes. We show that paxillin colocalizes with γ-tubulin at the cell MTOC, and interacts in vivo and in vitro with both α- and γ-tubulin. The association of paxillin with microtubule cytoskeletal components suggests a potential role for paxillin in the regulation of microtubule network functions. Fibronectin (FN) and poly-l-lysine were obtained from Sigma. ICAM-1-Fc was obtained as described (17Berendt A.R. McDowall A. Craig A.G. Bates P.A. Sternberg M.J.E. Marsh K. Newbold C.I. Hogg N. Cell. 1992; 14: 9-18Google Scholar). Anti-γ-tubulin polyclonal antibody, anti-vimentin (clone V9) mAb, anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate, and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin clone RG-16 peroxidase conjugate were purchased from Sigma. Negative controls P3X63 myeloma protein (IgG1, κ), and normal rabbit serum (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The two mAb anti-paxillin (clones 349 and 165) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit anti-talin N681 polyclonal antibody was kindly donated by Dr. K. Burridge (Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Human mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized blood of healthy adult volunteers by Ficoll-sodium metrizoate (IsoPrep, Robbins Scientific Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) density gradient centrifugation. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (were purified by two rounds of plastic adherence to remove monocytes. Monocytes were obtained by exhaustive negative selection using a mAb mixture and immunomagnetics beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Human T lymphoblasts were obtained from peripheral blood lymphocytes by treatment with phytohemagglutinin at 5 μg/ml for 48 h, and 50 units/ml interleukin-2. T lymphoblasts cultured by 7–12 days were typically used in the experiments (18Campanero M.R. Sanchez-Mateos P. del Pozo M.A. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The LexA two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins that interact with paxillin by screening a two-hybrid library. Reagents were provided by Dr. R. Brent (The Molecular Sciences Institute, Berkeley, CA) and Dr. R. Finley (Center For Molecular Medicine & Genetics; Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI). The C-terminal domain of paxillin (encoding LIM domains, amino acids 324–559) and the “nonspecific” protein bait, Bicoid, were cloned into pEG202 as a C-terminal fusion to LexA. Full-length () and paxillin N terminus () demonstrated transactivation potential and therefore were not amenable for a two-hybrid hunt. A HeLa cDNA library in pJG4–5, fused to the activation domain B42, was used in the screen. Plasmids were sequentially transformed by lithium acetate, into the yeast strain EGY48 harboring reporter genes LEU2 and lacZ(pSH18–34), that contain binding sites for LexA. Positive pJG4–5 library/prey plasmids were isolated and a directed interaction of the positive, isolated library/prey with nonspecific protein bait, Bicoid, was performed. A directed interaction with paxillin LIM domain plasmid (pEG202LIMS) was also performed to confirm the association. True-positive clones were sequenced at the BioResource Center of Cornell University (Ithaca, NY). Epicurian coliXL2-Blue Ultracompetent Cells (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) transformed with the appropriate pGEX2T-paxillin construct were grown overnight, diluted 1:20, and grown for an additional 4 h. Protein expression was induced for 3 h by the addition of 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranose. Cells were harvested and sonicated in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl), pH 7.6, containing protease inhibitors. Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the cells were incubated on ice for 60 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, the fusion proteins were recovered from the supernatant by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A lysate of T lymphoblasts (150 × 106 cells) was prepared in ice-cold lysis buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After two pre-clearings with GST-glutathione-Sepharose 4B, lysates were incubated overnight with the various GST-paxillin fusion proteins coupled to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads or with GST-glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Samples were then processed as in immunoprecipitation assays. After electrophoresis in 10% SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with the appropriate antibody. Cells (100 × 106 T lymphocytes) were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer A. Total cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. Supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with different primary antibodies. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing three times with lysis buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), and once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, proteins were solubilized in 2× Laemmli's buffer, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk protein and probed with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescent system (Pierce). Immunofluorescence analysis was performed essentially as described with slight changes (19Sanchez-Mateos P. Arroyo A.G. Balboa M.A. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2642-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, either 2 × 104 T lymphoblasts or monocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, on coverslips coated with 5 μg/ml ICAM-1Fc protein or 10 μg/ml FN and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, or coated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine or a suspension of peripheral blood lymphocytes was cytocentrifuged onto glass slides. Cells were fixed and permeabilized (2% formaldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 10 min and rinsed in Tris-buffered saline. Cells were stained with specific mAb or polyclonal antibodies, and after washing, were incubated with Cy2-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG and/or Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E800 photomicroscope with 100× oil immersion objective, 1.4 numeric aperture. Preparations were photographed on either Ektachrome or TMAX 400 ASA films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Confocal microscopy was performed using an MRC-1024 confocal laser scanning system (Bio-Rad) connected to a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope. Images of cellular sections were acquired every 0.5 μm. The C-terminal half of paxillin (amino acids 313–559) contains four contiguous double zinc finger LIM domains that are essential for targeting the protein to focal adhesions (4Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In a search for molecules that interact with paxillin LIM domains, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed with the C-terminal half of paxillin fused to LexA as a bait. Forty positive clones were isolated from the screening of 2.85 × 108 recombinant colonies. To confirm the observed interactions, selected clones were subjected to an additional round of screening using either a nonspecific protein bait, Bicoid, or the paxillin LIM domains. Sixteen plasmids turned out to be positive for paxillin LIM domain binding and simultaneously, negative for Bicoid association. The insert of one of the selected plasmids was isolated and its sequence revealed 100% identity with human α-tubulin sequence. The plasmid insert contained the entire coding region for α-tubulin (amino acids 1–451) as well as 172 nucleotides from the 3′-untranslated region. The isolated α-tubulin prey plasmid exhibited strong and specific interaction with paxillin LIM domains (Fig. 1 A). To confirm the specificity of binding between the C-terminal half of paxillin and α-tubulin, we used GST fusion proteins, corresponding to full-length paxillin, the C terminus (residues 325–559, composed of four LIM domains), or the N terminus (residues 1–313, containing five leucine-rich motifs). The ability of each fusion protein to bind to α-tubulin was tested by precipitation binding assays using an unlabeled T lymphoblast lysate, followed by Western blotting with antibodies to α-tubulin. Consistent with the two-hybrid results, α-tubulin was precipitated by the C-terminal half of paxillin as well as by the full-length paxillin (Fig. 1 B,lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, the N-terminal half of paxillin showed no affinity for α-tubulin (Fig.1 B, lane 4). These results indicate that the C-terminal LIM domains of paxillin interact in vitro with α-tubulin. Based on paxillin immunolocalization studies in T lymphocytes (see below), we also analyzed the interaction of paxillin with γ-tubulin, another member of the tubulin family that localizes specifically to the MTOC (20Stearns T. Evans L. Kirschner M. Cell. 1991; 65: 825-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To this end, similar GST-paxillin co-precipitation assays were performed and probed by Western blotting with antibodies to γ-tubulin. Interestingly, both the C and N termini, as well as full-length paxillin, bound to γ-tubulin (Fig. 1 C,lanes 2–4). Since γ-tubulin is a minor protein, present at less than 1% the level of α- and β-tubulin (20Stearns T. Evans L. Kirschner M. Cell. 1991; 65: 825-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), its association with paxillin appears to be very strong. Moreover, the data suggest that paxillin contains regions within both the C- and N terminus for binding γ-tubulin. To demonstrate the in vivo relevance of these interactions, α- or γ-tubulin were immunoprecipitated from a T lymphoblast lysate. The precipitates were subsequently blotted with paxillin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, a characteristic band of ∼68 kDa, which corresponds to paxillin, was co-immunoprecipitated with either α- or γ-tubulin (lanes 1 and 4, respectively). Conversely, α-tubulin was co-precipitated in the paxillin immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2,lane 8). As a control for specificity, paxillin was not detected in the immunoprecipitates of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin (data not shown). These data indicate that paxillin associates specifically with α- and γ-tubulin in T lymphoblasts. To study the subcellular distribution of paxillin in T lymphoblasts, cells were allowed to spread on ICAM-1-coated coverslips. Adherent cells displayed both a round or an initial polarized morphology (Fig.3 A). Immunofluorescence labeling revealed that paxillin was localized to the area of cell contact with the substratum, displaying a punctate distribution. Paxillin was also concentrated in a large perinuclear spot that appeared to be located in a different plane of focus (Fig.3 A). Immunofluorescence labeling with an alternative anti-paxillin mAb yielded an indistinguishable pattern of paxillin distribution, and staining with isotype-matched IgG or with secondary antibody alone revealed virtually no detectable signal (data not shown). Confocal microscopy analysis of a polarized lymphocyte confirmed that the large perinuclear spot of paxillin was at a distance of 2 μm above the substratum (Fig. 3 B). This position of the stained paxillin spot, at the base of the trailing edge of the polarized lymphocyte, is also the predicted location for the lymphocyte MTOC (21Sanchez-Madrid F. del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). To verify that the perinuclear paxillin staining corresponds to the MTOC, T lymphoblasts plated on ICAM-1 substratum were stained by double-label immunofluorescence with antibodies against paxillin and γ-tubulin (Fig. 4, A andB). The colocalization of the two proteins within the same optical section indicates that paxillin may be associated with γ-tubulin at the MTOC of T lymphoblasts. In addition, paxillin also colocalized with α-tubulin at the MTOC, but did not label cytoplasmic microtubules (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Similar results were obtained when single immunofluorescence labeling for paxillin, α- and γ-tubulin was performed, ruling out cross-detection of fluorescence (data not shown). Paxillin localizes primarily to focal adhesions in adherent cell types (3Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although lymphocytes do not develop these complex structures, several focal adhesion-associated proteins such as talin, α-actinin, and vinculin have been observed at the leading lamellipodium of these cells (18Campanero M.R. Sanchez-Mateos P. del Pozo M.A. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To analyze the relation of paxillin with this structure, double-staining of T lymphoblasts with paxillin and talin was performed. A fraction of paxillin was observed to colocalize with talin at the contact area with the substratum (Fig. 4 C). However, in contrast to the clear relocalization of talin to the leading lamellipodium, paxillin was only occasionally seen to concentrate at this structure (Fig. 4, C and D). Next, we studied whether the localization of paxillin to the MTOC could be detected during lymphocyte adhesion to fibronectin or poly-l-lysine. The same pattern of perinuclear staining of paxillin was observed when T lymphoblasts were plated on coverslips coated with both substrata (Fig. 5,A and B), indicating that paxillin localization to the MTOC was independent of the cellular receptors mediating adhesion. The distribution of paxillin in non-polarized resting peripheral blood lymphocytes was also studied using cytospin preparations. Most resting lymphocytes displayed a perinuclear spot of paxillin (Fig. 5 C) with no morphological correlation with the degree of cell polarization (Fig. 5 D). Finally, monocytes obtained from peripheral blood and plated on fibronectin were double stained for paxillin and γ-tubulin to localize the MTOC. A larger spot was differentiated from an additional paxillin staining pattern of small dots (Fig. 5 E). This larger spot of paxillin colocalized with γ-tubulin staining (Fig. 5 F), indicating that, in monocytes, paxillin may also be associated with the MTOC. The smaller dots of paxillin staining, located at the cell contact area with the substratum, are probably small focal contacts or focal complexes (Fig. 5 E). Therefore, we conclude that a constitutive localization of paxillin at the MTOC occurs in resting lymphocytes, monocytes and T lymphoblasts, and it is also present during the adhesion of these cells to various substrata. Paxillin is a focal adhesion-associated protein that functions as a multi-domain adapter molecule interacting with several structural and signaling proteins associated with focal adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton (3Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Here, we report a novel interaction of paxillin with components of the microtubule cytoskeleton in T lymphocytes, namely α- and γ-tubulin. This association is supported by: (i) the isolation of α-tubulin in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the C-terminal LIM domains of paxillin as a bait, (ii) the identification of both α- and γ-tubulin as proteins binding to GST fusion proteins containing different domains of paxillin in precipitation binding assays, (iii) the co-immunoprecipitation of paxillin with α- and γ-tubulin in T lymphoblasts, and (iv) the subcellular localization of paxillin to the MTOC of T cells, where it colocalizes with α and γ-tubulin. The localization of paxillin to focal adhesions has been demonstrated in a variety of adherent cell types, where it has previously been implicated in the regulation of focal adhesion assembly and in the modulation of the signal transduction through these elements (3Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 22Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1058-1068Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The LIM domains of paxillin function in determining the subcellular localization of this protein, with LIM3 being required for targeting paxillin to focal adhesions (4Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the present study α-tubulin was isolated as a paxillin LIM domain-interacting protein. The in vivo relevance of this interaction was explored in T lymphoblasts, where we had previously demonstrated that the paxillin-binding proteins FAK and Pyk2 localize to the MTOC (23Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Gomez M. Luque A. Hogg N. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabañas C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1891-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this cellular system, paxillin was found to co-immunoprecipitate with α-tubulin and to localize to the MTOC. Based on this localization, another member of the tubulin family, γ-tubulin, which associates specifically with the MTOC, was included in this study. The co-immunoprecipitation and the colocalization of paxillin and γ-tubulin suggest an in vivo interaction of these proteins. γ-Tubulin is believed to distribute between cytoplasmic and MTOC-associated pools (24Moudjou M. Bordes N. Paintrand M. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 875-887PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of paxillin to the centrosomal area suggests that an interaction between paxillin and the MTOC-resident γ-tubulin can take place at this region. However, the interaction of paxillin with cytoplasmic γ-tubulin complexes cannot be excluded. The biochemical properties of centrosomal and cytoplasmic γ-tubulin appear to be similar, and, in both cases, the γ-tubulin exists in large complexes, whose exact composition remains to be determined (25Stearns T. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 623-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 26Zheng Y. Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 857-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is of note that both the N- and C-domains of paxillin bind to γ-tubulin, suggesting that paxillin could interact with more than one γ-tubulin molecule. We have observed the MTOC localization of paxillin in cells exhibiting both integrin- and non-integrin-mediated adhesions, indicating that this distribution is not related to the nature of the receptors mediating the cell attachment to the substratum. Furthermore, we have shown that this perinuclear localization is present in resting lymphocytes in suspension, indicating that this pattern of paxillin distribution could be constitutive in lymphoid cells. Interestingly, the signaling molecules FAK, Pyk2, and the isoenzymes of protein kinase C β(I) and protein kinase C δ also localize to the MTOC of T cells (23Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Gomez M. Luque A. Hogg N. Sanchez-Madrid F. Cabañas C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1891-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Volkov Y. Long A. Kelleher D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6487-6495PubMed Google Scholar). Since paxillin binds to FAK and Pyk2 in a variety of cellular settings, our data indicating the paxillin association with γ-tubulin provide a potential mechanism for the attachment of these regulatory molecules to the lymphocyte MTOC. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the lymphocyte MTOC could be another important cellular area in which the compartmentalization of kinases and their interaction with substrates may take place. This confluence of signaling molecules could have a role in the regulation of centrosomal functions, such as positioning of cytoplasmic organelles, during the immune response. For example, during the interaction of lymphocytes with either target cells, or antigen-presenting cells, the Golgi apparatus is rapidly positioned by the MTOC to face the bound cell (31Kupfer A.

In this regard, recent reports implicate distinct and specific signaling pathways in the regulation of MTOC reorientation in lymphocytes (33Lowin-Kropf B. Shapiro V.S. Weiss A. J.

Accordingly, we have recently described the translocation of Pyk2 and the MTOC from the uropod to the cell-cell contact area upon specific recognition of target cells by NK cell receptors (35Sancho D. Nieto M. Llano M. Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Tejedor R. Avraham S. Cabañas C. Lopez-Botet M. Sanchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1249-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to ascertain the role of paxillin and other regulatory molecules during this process. The dynamic interactions between the actin and microtubule systems appear to be critical for many cellular processes including cell migration, organelle transport, and nuclear and cleavage furrow positioning (36Gavin R.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 173: 207-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several molecules have been implicated in linking microtubule and microfilament networks in relation with each of these processes, but the functional significance of these interactions remains to be elucidated (for a review, see Refs. 37Fuchs E. Yang Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 547-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar and 38Goode B.L. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Recent work indicates that changes in microtubule dynamics affect microfilament assembly at the leading edge of migrating cells (39Waterman-Storer C.M. Salmon E.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Interestingly, during cell spreading and cell migration, the growing ends of microtubules are targeted to and captured at early focal adhesions (40Kaverina I. Rottner K. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the targeting of microtubules to focal adhesions correlates with instability of these structures, resulting in their disassembly and localized cell detachment from the substratum. This suggests an important role for microtubules in regulating cell motility and polarity through modulating the interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and its associated proteins (41Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Our results, demonstrating a direct interaction between the focal adhesion protein paxillin and α-tubulin, suggest that paxillin could be responsible for this capture of microtubule ends at cortical actin foci.

MARCKS-GFP was rapidly translocated from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm after the treatment with phorbol ester, which translocates protein kinase C (PKC) to the plasma membrane. In contrast, PKC activation by hydrogen peroxide, which was not accompanied by PKC translocation, did not alter the intracellular localization of MARCKS-GFP. Non-myristoylated mutant of MARCKS-GFP was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, including the nucleoplasm, and was not translocated by phorbol ester or by hydrogen peroxide. Phosphorylation of wild-type MARCKS-GFP was observed in cells treated with phorbol ester but not with hydrogen peroxide, whereas non-myristoylated mutant of MARCKS-GFP was phosphorylated in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide but not with phorbol ester. Phosphorylation of both MARCKS-GFPs reduced the amount of F-actin. These findings revealed that PKC targeting to the plasma membrane is required for the phosphorylation of membrane-associated MARCKS and that a mutant MARCKS existing in the cytoplasm can be phosphorylated by PKC activated in the cytoplasm without translocation but not by PKC targeted to the membrane.

This multifunctional enzyme consists of at least 10 subtypes that can be classified into three groups based on structure, cPKC (α, βI, βII, and γ), nPKC (δ, ε, η, and θ), and aPKC (ζ and λ) (3Nishizuka Y.

Studying the electron microscopic co-localization of PKC subtypes and substrate has been thought to be an attractive way to learn about the functional specificity of PKC subtypes, but it was also demonstrated that PKC translocates to different subcellular compartments after activation by physiological stimuli. The mechanism of PKC translocation was then studied in living cells using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PKC, and it has been shown that each PKC subtype has a spatially and temporally different targeting mechanism that depends on the extracellular signals, contributing to the subspecies-specific functions of PKC (12Oancea E.

In the present study, to clarify the physiological significance of PKC targeting and to elucidate the importance of PKC targeting in the phosphorylation of a substrate by the enzyme, the movement of MARCKS was monitored in living cells using GFP-tagged MARCKS. Also, the phosphorylation of MARCKS and of its mutants was examined after PKC activation with or without PKC translocation. TPA and UTP were purchased from Sigma. Hydrogen peroxide was from Santoku Chemical Industries Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Staurosporine was from Kyowa Pure Pharmaceutical Industries (Osaka, Japan). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Strain CHO-K1 (ATCC CCL 61) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 44 mmNaHCO3 and 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The medium was supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and the fetal bovine serum used was not heat-inactivated. An expression plasmid for mammalian cells (designated as BS354) that can fuse humanized GFP (a kind gift from Dr. Umezono, Kyoto University) at the C terminus of the target protein was prepared as described previously (14Shirai Y. Kashiwagi K. Yagi K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 511-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). cDNA for MARCKS/80K-L (44Sakai K. Hirai M. Kudoh J. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Genomics. 1992; 14: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pBluescript II KS(–) (designated as BS 518). A MARCKS cDNA withEcoRI site at both the 5′ and 3′ termini was produced by PCR using BS 518 as a template. The sense and antisense primers used were 5′-TTGAATTCAGCATGGCTGCCCAG-3′ and 5′-TTCCGGAATTCCTCTGCCGCCTC-3′, respectively. After digestion with EcoRI, the PCR products were subcloned into EcoRI site in BS 354. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using an Exsite PCR site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with BS 518 as a template, in order to make a mutant MARCKS-GFP, the three putative PKC phosphorylation sites of which (Ser-152, Ser-156, and Ser-163) were substituted to Ala (designated as BS 580 (m3)) (Fig.1 C). For m3 mutant, the PCR primers used were 5′-CCTTCAAGCTGAGCGGCTTCGCCTTCAAG-3′ and 5′-CCTTCTTGAAGGCAAAGCGCTTCTTTTT-3′. In addition, to make a mutant MARCKS-GFP that was not myristoylated and was unable to bind plasma membrane, a glycine residue (at position 2) was replaced with Ala using the same methods as described above (Fig. 1 B). For this, the primers used were 5′-TTGAATTCAGCATGGCTGCCCAG-3′ and 5′-TTCCGGAATTCCTCTGCCGCCTC-3′. All PCR products were verified by sequencing. Plasmids (∼5.5 μg) including wild-type MARCKS-GFP and its mutant cDNAs (BS555, BS580, and BS644) were transfected to 106 CHO-K1 cells by lipofection using TransITTM-LT2 (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. The fluorescence of MARCKS-GFP became detectable 16 h after the transfection. All experiments were performed 2 days after transfection. MARCKS-GFP or its mutant cDNAs (BS555 and BS644) were transiently transfected into CHO-K1 cells by Trans IT. After transfected cells were cultured at 37 °C for 16 h, cells were treated with 100 nm TPA or 5 mm H2O2 for 10 min at 37 °C and then harvested with 5 ml of homogenate buffer (250 mmsucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). After the sonication (UD-210 Tomy Seiko, Tokyo, Japan) (output, 5; duty, 50%; 10 times at 4 °C), samples were centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), and supernatant was collected as the cytosol fraction. The pellets were sonicated with 500 μl of homogenate buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 19,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected as the particulate fraction. For immunoblotting, the same amount of samples from each fraction (20 μg) were subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding sites on the polyvinylidene difluoride filters were blocked by incubation with 2% bovine serum albumin in 0.01 m PBS containing 0.03% Triton X-100 for 18 h. The polyvinylidene difluoride filters were then incubated with the anti-phospho-MARCKS polyclonal antibody (anti-pp-3) (45Yamamoto H. Matsumura T. Kugiyama K. Oishi Y. Ogata N. Yasue H. Miyamoto E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (diluted 1:200) or the anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) (diluted 1:1000) for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing with 0.01 m PBS containing 0.03% Triton X-100, the filters were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunogloblin G (The Jackson Laboratory, Arlington Heights, IL) (diluted 1:10000) for 30 min. After three rinses, the immunoreactive bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation of MARCKS-GFP or its mutants, transfected cells were harvested with 0.5 ml of homogenate buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and were homogenated by sonication. After centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was rotated with an anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:50) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 h at 4 °C and then with protein A-Sepharose for an additional 2 h. Samples were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and pellets were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS(–)). Finally, the pellet was suspended in 50 μl of PBS(–) and used for phosphorylation or immunoblotting studies as described below. CHO-K1 cells expressing MARCKS-GFP or its mutants were spread onto glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and cultured for at least 16 h before observation. The culture medium was replaced with normal Hepes buffer composed of 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Hepes, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3. The fluorescence of GFP was monitored under a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at 488-nm argon excitation with a 515-nm-long pass barrier filter. Translocation of the fusion protein was triggered by the addition of various stimulators at high concentrations into the Hepes buffer to obtain the appropriate final concentrations. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. CHO-K1 cells cultured in glass-bottomed dishes expressing MARCKS and its fusion protein were observed under a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope. After the conformation of their translocation by TPA, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 mPBS for 30 min. After three washes with 0.1 m PBS, the cells were treated with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum for 20 min. Cells were sequentially incubated with anti-phospho-MARCKS polyclonal antibody (pp-3, diluted 1:1000) for 40 min in PBS with 0.03% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) and 10% normal goat serum and then with Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at room temperature. The fluorescence of phospho-MARCKS-like immunoreactivity was observed under a confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope at 588-nm argon excitation with a 590-nm-long pass barrier filter. GFP fluorescence was observed at 488-nm argon excitation with a 515-nm-long pass barrier filter. Endogenous δ-PKC was immunoprecipitated from normal CHO-K1 cells using anti-δ-PKC antibody, and δ-PKC-GFP was immunoprecipitated from CHO-K1 cells transfected with δ-PKC-GFP. The immunoprecipitated samples (10 μl of suspended pellet) were used for kinase assays. The kinase activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of 32Pi into calf thymus H1 histone from [γ-32P]ATP without any activators, such as phosphatidylserine, diolein, and Ca2+, as described previously (47Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujii M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MARCKS-GFP and its mutants were prepared by immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP antibody from CHO-K1 cells transfected with the corresponding cDNA. The standard phosphorylation assay was performed in the reaction mixture containing MARCKS-GFP or its mutants, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 16 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 1.6 μg/ml diolein, 15–50 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP, and the immunoprecipitated PKCδ using monoclonal anti-δ PKC antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) in a total volume of 15 μl. The reaction was carried out for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 2× SDS-sample buffer, and the phosphorylated proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For photobleaching experiments, a squared region within a plane of the cell was photobleached by scanning for 30 s with the highest laser power. Recovery of fluorescence into the photobleached region was then observed by imaging the entire cell by confocal fluorescent microscopy with low laser power at the indicated times after photobleaching. In all of the images, the noise levels were reduced by line scan averaging. The CHO-K1 cells expressing wild-type and mutant MARCKS-GFP were cultured in glass-bottomed dishes. The cells were treated with TPA and H2O2 in the KRH buffer and then fixed with a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.01 m PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were treated with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum for 10 min. For the staining of F-actin, cells were incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin (0.18–0.36 units/ml) for 40 min in PBS-T and 5% normal goat serum. After three washes with PBS-T for 10 min, the fluorescence of stained F-actin was observed under a confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope (LSM 410 invert, Carl Zeiss). The fluorescence of rhodamine-phalloidin was observed at 588 nm argon excitation with a 590-nm-long pass barrier filter. We examined the effects of GFP fusion on the characteristics of MARCKS by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2, MARCKS-GFP was predominantly detected in the particulate fraction as a specific single band with the reasonable molecular mass of 110 kDa by anti-GFP polyclonal antibody. Treatment with TPA induced the translocation of MARCKS-GFP from the particulate to the cytosol fraction. No degraded products of MARCKS-GFP were found in the control cells or even in the cells treated with TPA. We examined the expression levels of endogenous and GFP-fused MARCKS. The cells expressing MARCKS-GFP were homogenated after the TPA treatment (1 μm, 10 min), and then the samples were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-MARCKS (anti-pp-3) antibodies. Alternatively, the homogenate of cells expressing MARCKS-GFP was treated with TPA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and then the expression levels were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The GFP-tagged MARCKS was expressed at a level between 7- and 10-fold that of endogenous MARCKS (data not shown). The translocation of MARCKS after the activation of PKC was visualized by monitoring GFP fluorescence in living cells expressing MARCKS-GFP. Intense fluorescence of MARCKS-GFP was observed on the plasma membrane of the transfected CHO-K1 cells in vivo (Fig.3). The activation of PKC by 100 nm TPA induced a rapid translocation of MARCKS from the plasma membrane to the cytosol (Fig. 3 A) within 20 s after the stimulation. Fluorescence gradually accumulated in the perinuclear region, remained there for at least 60 min after treatment with TPA, and did not return to the plasma membrane. The activation of PKC through purinergic receptors by UTP (100 μm) induced a rapid and reversible translocation of MARCKS-GFP (Fig.3 B). Within 10 s after UTP stimulation, MARCKS-GFP was translocated from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, then from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, and was restored within 1 min to a state similar to that before stimulation. To investigate whether or not the translocation of MARCKS is induced by its phosphorylation by PKC, we examined the effects of staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of protein kinases, on the translocation of MARCKS-GFP. TPA-induced translocation was completely blocked by pretreatment with 1 μmstaurosporine (Fig. 3 C). Similarly, UTP-induced translocation was inhibited by staurosporine (data not shown). GFP fluorescence showed that MARCKS-GFP was mainly found on the plasma membrane and faintly in the cytoplasm (Fig.4 a), as seen in the living cells. However, no immunoreactivity for phospho-MARCKS was detected in the untreated CHO-K1 cells expressing MARCKS or MARCKS-GFP when anti-phospho-MARCKS (anti-pp-3) antibodies that recognize the three putative PKC phosphorylation sites were used (Fig. 4, b andc). After TPA treatment, intense immunoreactivity for phospho-MARCKS was observed in the cytosol of the CHO-K1 cells expressing MARCKS or MARCKS-GFP (Fig. 4, e andf). The intracellular distribution of the GFP fluorescence of MARCKS-GFP corresponded with the immunoreactivities for phospho-MARCKS in TPA-treated CHO-K1 cells expressing MARCKS or MARCKS-GFP (Fig. 4, d–f). To examine the mechanism of the translocation of MARCKS-GFP induced by PKC activation, we constructed cDNAs for mutants of MARCKS-GFP. In BS580 (m3), three PKC phosphorylation sites (Ser-152, Ser-156, and Ser-163) were mutated to alanine, as described above (Fig. 1). BS580 was not expected to be phosphorylated by PKC. The m3 mutant (BS580) was only seen on the plasma membrane of the transfected cells, and TPA failed to induce the translocation of this mutant (Fig.5 A). In BS644 (G2A), the N-terminal glycine was replaced with alanine, resulting in a non-myristoylated molecule. Non-myristoylated MARCKS-GFP was present throughout the cytoplasm, including the nucleoplasm, and no significant change in its localization was seen after TPA treatment (Fig. 5 B). Stimulation with UTP that also activates PKC through G protein-coupled purinergic receptors also failed to induce the translocation of both m3 and G2A mutants of MARCKS-GFP (data not shown). We examined whether translocation of MARCKS-GFP is induced by treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that activates δ-PKC by its tyrosine phosphorylation but does not translocate δ-PKC (46Konishi H.

Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basal kinase activity of transfected δ-PKC-GFP, which was immunoprecipitated with the anti-δ-PKC antibody, was 2–2.5-fold higher than that of endogenous δ-PKC (Fig.6 B). The kinase activities of both endogenous and transfected δ-PKC-GFP were increased 3-fold after treatment with 5 mm H2O2 for 10 min. However, the same treatment with H2O2 did not alter the localization of MARCKS-GFP, as seen in Fig.6 A. The phosphorylation of MARCKS-GFP and its mutants (m3 and G2A) was examined by immunoblotting after TPA and H2O2 treatment (Fig.7) using anti-phospho-MARCKS (anti-pp-3) antibody. Wild-type MARCKS-GFP was predominantly localized in the particulate fraction, and phosphorylated MARCKS-GFP was not detected before stimulation with TPA. TPA treatment translocated MARCKS-GFP from particulate to cytosolic fraction, and the translocated MARCKS-GFP in the cytosol was phosphorylated (Fig. 7 A). The m3 mutant MARCKS-GFP was also unphosphorylated before stimulation, whereas the G2A mutant was slightly phosphorylated without stimulation. The expression level of the two mutants was similar to that of wild-type MARCKS-GFP (approximately 7–10-fold that of endogenous MARCKS). Neither the localization of G2A in the cytosol fraction nor that of m3 mutant in the particulate fraction was altered by TPA treatment. Furthermore, neither mutant was phosphorylated by TPA treatment. In contrast, H2O2 treatment caused neither PKC-dependent phosphorylation nor translocation of either wild-type or m3 mutant of MARCKS. It is noteworthy that G2A mutant MARCKS-GFP was phosphorylated after treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 7 B), although G2A mutant MARCKS-GFP did not show translocation by H2O2treatment. We further examined the phosphorylation of wild-type MARCKS-GFP and G2A mutant MARCKS-GFP by δ-PKC in vitro using autoradiography and immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MARCKS (anti-pp3) antibody. δ-PKC, which was immunoprecipitated from non-treated CHO-K1 cells overexpressing δ-PKC, phosphorylated both wild-type and G2A mutant MARCKS-GFP in the presence of TPA (Fig.8 A). In addition, δ-PKC, which was immunoprecipitated from the H2O2- or TPA-treated cells, also phosphorylated both types of MARCKS in the absence of TPA (Fig. 8). The levels of phosphorylation were similar between wild-type and G2A mutant MARCKS-GFP and also similar between the treatment with TPA and H2O2 (Fig.8). However, the levels of phosphorylation of both types of MARCKS using PKC from treated cells without TPA were slightly lower than that assayed in the presence of TPA using PKC from untreated cells (data not shown). We investigated the phosphorylation-dependent interaction of MARCKS with macromolecule within the cells. Although both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated G2A mutants were distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the transfected cells, wild-type MARCKS accumulated around the nucleus after TPA treatment (Fig.9 A). In the photobleaching experiments, we measured the time necessary for the recovery of fluorescence in a square that was photobleached by a 488-nm argon laser. Photobleaching of wild-type MARCKS-GFP in the perinuclear region of the TPA-treated cell abolished the fluorescence of GFP in the square, and the fluorescence slowly recovered. The phosphorylated wild-type MARCKS-GFP had a recovery time of more than 5 min (Fig.9 A). In contrast, photobleaching of G2A-GFP in a squared area of H2O2-treated cells r"

In this study we examine the role of the ER LBD in mediating ligand-dependent RelA transrepression. Both ERα and ERβ inhibit RelA in response to 17β-estradiol but not in the presence of antihormones. We have identified residues within the ERα LBD that are responsible for receptor dimerization and show that dimerization is necessary for transactivation and transrepression. Moreover we have generated mutant receptors that have lost their ability to inhibit RelA but retain their capacity to stimulate transcription and conversely mutants that are transcriptionally defective but capable of antagonizing RelA. Overexpression of p160 and cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300 co-activators failed to relieve repression of RelA, which is consistent with the demonstration that RelA inhibition can occur independently of these co-activators. These findings suggest it is unlikely that sequestration of these cofactors required for ER transcriptional activation can account for hormone-dependent antagonism of RelA. The identification of ER mutants that discriminate between transactivation and transrepression implies that distinct surfaces within the LBD are involved in mediating these two receptor functions.

In common with other members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, ER contains three functional domains, an N-terminal region with a hormone-independent activation function (AF1), a conserved central DNA binding domain (DBD), and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD), which is responsible for high affinity ligand binding, dimerization, and hormone-dependent activation (AF2) (1Parker M.G.

In response to hormone binding, ER homodimers contact estrogen response elements (ERE) located within the regulatory sequences of target genes, resulting in the recruitment of co-activator proteins and consequent initiation of gene transcription (6Bevan C.

In addition to stimulating transcription by directly binding cognate response elements within the promoters of responsive genes, NRs are able to regulate gene expression in the absence of DNA binding by modulating the activity of other transcription factors.

NF-κB is a key inducible regulator of multiple genes involved in proliferation and immune functions. In its latent state, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through association with inhibitory IκB proteins. Activation of a variety of signaling pathways leads to the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, resulting in the release of NF-κB and subsequent translocation to the nucleus where it binds to DNA recognition elements and stimulates gene transcription (29Baldwin A.S.

Proteins comprising the NF-κB family share a conserved N-terminal Rel homology domain, which contains the DNA binding domain, dimerization interface, and nuclear localization signals that are masked when this region interacts with IκB. Transcriptionally active NF-κB is composed of homo- or heterodimers of various family members, most typically heterodimers of RelA (p65), which contains two C-terminal transcription activation domains, and NF-κB1 (p50) (29Baldwin A.S.

In this study we have examined the role of specific residues within the ERα LBD in mediating ligand-dependent inhibition of RelA activity. Based on the recently determined structural models of NR LBDs, we have identified residues that are essential for receptor dimerization and demonstrate that dimerization is required for both receptor transcriptional activity and antagonism. Using point mutagenesis of the LBD we have identified transcriptionally inactive ERα mutants that retain their ability to suppress RelA and conversely mutants that activate transcription but have lost their capacity to inhibit RelA. Discrimination between the transactivation and transrepression properties of the receptor suggests that different surfaces in the LBD are involved in mediating these two ligand-dependent functions and moreover that the p160/CBP cofactors required for ER-induced gene transcription are unlikely to be involved in functional antagonism of NF-κB. The following wild-type and mutant mouse estrogen receptors have been described previously: pMT2 MOR, (ERα) G525R, L543A/L544A (43Lahooti H. White R. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Mol.

RelA cDNA was digested from RelA pBluescript as a HindIII-XbaI fragment that was end-filled and ligated into the SmaI site in pSG5. The pSG5 TIF2, pCMVβ-p300, pRc/Rous sarcoma virus CBP, and 2XERE-pS2-CAT reporter plasmids were kind gifts of Dr. P. Chambon, Dr. R. Goodman, and Dr. B. Katzenellenbogen. The 2XERE-pS2-pGL3 reporter was made by subcloning the 2XERE-pS2 promoter region as anAsp718 and NcoI fragment from 2XERE-pS2-CAT into the pGL3 vector. Recombinant polymerase chain reaction using overlapping oligonucleotides containing base substitutions was used to generate the ERα helix 11 mutants pSG5 L508A/L512A/L515A, L508E/L512E/L515E, A509E, S516A/R519A, H520A/N523A, and S516A/R519A/H520A/N523A using wild-type pSG5 ERα template and to make the RelA mutant pSG5-RelA L453A/L454A. All polymerase chain reaction-derived mutant constructs were verified by automated sequencing. HeLa and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transient transfection assays, cells were plated into 24-well plates in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% dextran-charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected using a modified calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (49Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar) with either 1 μg of ICAM-tk-Luc reporter plasmid, 150 ng of PDMLacZ internal control plasmid, 10 ng of pSG5-RelA, and 250 ng of estrogen receptor expression plasmids or with 1 μg of either 2XERE-pS2-CAT or 2XERE-pS2-pGL3 reporter, 150 ng of PDMLacZ, and 10 ng of estrogen receptor expression plasmids. Where appropriate, empty expression vectors were added to equalize the amount of DNA present in each well, and where indicated 100 ng of co-activators SRC1, TIF2, CBP, and p300 were cotransfected with reporter and expression plasmids. After 16 h the cells were washed, fresh medium containing ethanol vehicle, 10−8m 17β-estradiol (E2), 10−7m 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), or 10−7m ICI 182,780 (ICI) was added as shown, and the cells were incubated for a further 24 h. Subsequently cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.65% Nonidet P-40), and the extracts were assayed for luciferase (12Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) and CAT (50Sleigh M.J. Anal.

Reporter activities were then standardized against β-galactosidase activity of the internal control vector PDMLacZ measured by the Galacto-Light chemiluminescent assay (Tropix). For Western analysis, wild-type and mutant receptors were overexpressed in COS-1 cells, whole cell extracts were prepared, and protein content was determined as described previously (13Henttu P.M.A. Kalkhoven E. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1832-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In vitrotranslated ERα wild-type and mutant receptors were synthesized using the TNT-coupledin vitro translation system (Promega). Proteins were incubated with a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing a consensus ERE from the vitellogenin A2 gene promoter in the presence of preimmune serum or ERα-specific MP16 antibody as described previously (51Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Receptor-DNA complexes were resolved from unbound DNA on nondenaturing 7% polyacrylamide gels and were visualized by autoradiography. Whole cell extracts were prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant ERα expression vectors. Samples containing 5 μg of total protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. The membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% nonfat milk powder, washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated for 1 h with either the MP16 polyclonal antibody raised against the 130–142 region of mouse ERα (51Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) or the H222 monoclonal antibody raised in rat against human ERα. Following washing, the membranes were incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit or anti-rat immunoglobulins (DAKO), respectively, the membranes were washed, and bound antibodies were visualized with the ECL western detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST and GST-SRC1-(570–780) fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the method previously described (52Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10009-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Proteins were synthesized in vitro from wild-type and mutant ERα cDNA templates using the TNT-coupled in vitro translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with GST or GST-SRC1 fusion proteins coupled to beads for a minimum of 3 h in NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors in the presence or absence of 10−6m E2. Samples were washed in NETN, and bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm equivalent amounts of GST proteins were present followed by detection of labeled proteins by fluorography. The ability of ER to modulate RelA activity in the presence of various ligands was determined in HeLa cells cotransfected with a RelA expression plasmid and ICAM-tk-Luc reporter containing three NF-κB-response elements in the presence or absence of ERs. Cells were subsequently treated with either no hormone (NH), E2, OHT, or ICI, and the effect on RelA transactivation is presented in Fig. 1. Consistent with previous findings, expression of ERα in the presence of E2 resulted in a 5-fold decrease in RelA activity. The receptor also inhibited RelA activity in the absence of ligand, a phenomenon that has been previously noted with ER, progesterone receptor, and AR (28Stein B. Yang M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4971-4979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kalkhoven E. Wissink S. van der Saag P.T. van der Berg B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24151-24156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To address whether this effect could be attributed to residual steroids present in the medium, we made use of the ERα mutant G525R, which cannot bind E2 but retains responsiveness to OHT (53Danielian P.S. White R. Hoare S.A. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of RelA and G525R resulted in a hormone-independent decrease in RelA activity relative to RelA alone, although this reduction was less than with wild-type ERα in the absence of hormone. As expected, the addition of E2 had no further effect on G525R-mediated RelA transrepression. This finding suggests that low levels of estrogens in the culture medium may, in part, account for the observed ligand-independent inhibition; however, the unoccupied receptor is capable of functionally interfering with RelA transcriptional activity. We next examined the effect of hormone on the modulation of RelA activity by ERβ (Fig. 1). In common with ERα, expression of ERβ resulted in a decrease in RelA activity, which was further reduced in the presence of E2. Antihormones abrogate the ability of the ER to stimulate transcription of ERE-containing reporter genes in many cell types. It was therefore of interest to determine whether these agents also antagonize the inhibitory effect of ER on RelA transcription. Treatment with OHT and ICI had no effect on RelA activity alone but completely relieved transrepression of RelA mediated by ERα and ERβ (Fig. 1). In addition, exposure to OHT abolished the inhibitory effect of the G525R mutant on RelA. The above findings demonstrate that both ERα and ERβ mediate similar ligand-dependent actions on RelA transcriptional activity. We have previously characterized a region within ERα, which is responsible for receptor dimerization (51Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G.

Synaptotagmin can bind the assembled SNARE complex and penetrate into membranes simultaneously (12Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These interactions occur at Ca2+concentrations capable of eliciting exocytosis (2Heidelberger R. Heinemann C. Neher E. Matthews G. Nature. 1994; 371: 513-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) and therefore may couple Ca2+ influx to fusion. These findings prompt a model in which the interaction of the C2A domain with membranes serves to alter the physical relationship between SNAREs and the lipid bilayer. This model prompts the question as to whether Ca2+triggers the interaction of the C2A domain of synaptotagmin with the synaptic vesicle membrane (a “cis” interaction) or whether Ca2+·C2A interacts with the presynaptic plasma membrane (a “trans” interaction). To address this issue we have reconstituted an N-terminal fragment of synaptotagmin that encodes the luminal, transmembrane, linker, and C2A domain of the protein into proteoliposomes. The C2A domain was modified to contain a single fluorescent reporter group, a tryptophan (Trp), which could be used to monitor the penetration of C2A into membranes in real-time (11, 12), and a kinetic approach was used to discern betweencis and trans interactions. In the course of these experiments we observed a novel mode of synaptotagmin oligomerization mediated via the N-terminal region of the protein. Furthermore, we refined the geometry of C2A·membrane interactions by measuring the depth of penetration of the Ca2+-binding loops of C2A. Finally, we observed that Ca2+-triggered synaptotagmin·lipid and synaptotagmin·SNARE interactions can be uncoupled via mutagenesis of the C2A domain making it possible to address discrete synaptotagmin interactions via genetic approaches. cDNAs encoding rat synaptotagmin I (7Perin M.

After purification, C2A-TMRTrp was dialyzed against 4 liters of HEPES buffer I (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 mNaCl, and 1% sodium cholate) overnight. For acrylamide and brominated-lipid quenching experiments, soluble C2A, with either a loop 1 Trp reporter (Trp-173) or a loop 3 Trp reporter (Trp-234) were prepared as described (12Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Brain-derived phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylcholine (PC), synthetic dansyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (dansyl-PE), 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(6,7)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (6,7-Br2-PC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(11,12)-dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (11,12-Br2-PC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). To prepare proteoliposomes, lipids were dried and dissolved in HEPES buffer I containing 2 μm protein. Proteoliposomes were formed by dialyzing the lipid/detergent/protein mixture against 4 liters of HEPES buffer II (50 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl) overnight at 4 °C. For fluorescence studies, large (∼100 nm) unilamellar liposomes (26MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P.M. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) were prepared using an Avanti Polar Lipids extruder according to the manufacturer's instructions. l-3-Phosphatidyl[N-methyl-3H]choline-1,2-dipalmitoyl ([3H]PC) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.3H-Labeled 25% PS/75% PC liposome binding assays were carried out as described (11, 27). In all experiments, error bars represent the standard deviations from triplicate determinations. For Ca2+titration experiments, [Ca2+]free was determined using an MI-600 Ca2+ electrode and an MI-402 microreference electrode (Microelectrode Inc., Bedford, NH) and World Precision Instruments Inc. (Sarasota, FL) Ca2+ standards (pCa2+ range of 1–8). Ca2+ concentrations below 100 μm were buffered using 2 mmEGTA. Proteoliposomes (75 μl aliquots) were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min in an Airfuge (Beckman). Pelleted proteoliposomes were resuspended in the indicated buffers and incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and again subjected to centrifugation. 8% of the supernatants and pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using anti-synaptotagmin monoclonal antibodies (41.1). Mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against synaptobrevin (69.1) and synaptotagmin (41.1) were kindly provided by R. Jahn (Göttingen, Germany). All immunoprecipitation and bead-binding experiments were carried out at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of recombinant SNARE complexes was carried out as described (12Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, SNARE complexes were incubated with recombinant synaptotagmin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) plus 0.5% Triton X-100 in the presence of 2 mm EGTA or 1 mm Ca2+ for 2 h. Synaptobrevin was immunoprecipitated by incubating the samples with 69.1 (1.5 μl) ascites for 2 h and 12 μl of protein G-Sepharose Fast-Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue. As a control for nonspecific precipitation of synaptotagmin, samples were also prepared lacking SNAREs. In each case, the immunoprecipitating antibodies did not bind synaptotagmin, and, under the conditions of the binding assays, synaptotagmin did not precipitate in the absence of SNAREs. Thus, for experiments shown in Fig. 1, samples lacking SNARE complexes (−) also lacked immunoprecipitating antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation of synaptotagmin was quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-670 imaging densitometer. To avoid increases in synaptotagmin co-immunoprecipitation due to Ca2+-triggered oligomerization, a nonoligomerizing version of synaptotagmin I (7Perin M. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C.

Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) was used in all co-immunoprecipitation experiments. 20 μg of GST, GST-C2A-TMR (amino acids 1–265), GST-C2A (), and GST-synaptobrevin (full-length) immobilized on beads was incubated with 1 μm soluble His6-C2A-TMR (amino acids 1–265) for 4 h in 150 μl of HEPES II buffer in either 2 mm EGTA or 1 mm Ca2+. Beads were washed three times in binding buffer plus 2 mm EGTA or 1 mm Ca2+. 7% of the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using monoclonal Penta-His antibodies (Qiagen). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were made at 24 °C using a PTI QM-1 fluorometer and Felix software, samples were mixed using a castle-style stir bar. Proteoliposome suspensions containing 2 μm protein and 0.75 mm lipid were mixed with protein free liposomes and excited at 285 nm with 2-nm resolution. For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, protein free liposomes contained 5% dansyl-PE, 25% PS, and 70% PC. FRET was monitored by quenching of the Trp donor fluorescence by the dansyl acceptor. Stopped-flow rapid mixing experiments were carried out at 24 °C using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrometer. Samples were excited at 285 nm, and emitted light was collected using a 326.1-nm bandpass filter. Acrylamide quenching measurements were carried out using a 2 m stock solution of acrylamide. The quencher was added to 7.5 μm C2A-Trp reporter (Trp-173 in loop 1 and Trp-234 in loop 3, respectively) in the presence of either 2 mm EGTA, 1 mmCa2+ or 1 mm Ca2+ plus liposomes (2 mm lipid; 75%PC/25%PS) as indicated. The emission spectra were corrected for blank, dilution, and instrument response and integrated from 300–400 nm to yield the fluorescence intensity. The degree of quenching was analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation (Equation 1): Fo/F=1+KSV[Q]Equation 1 where F o and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of acrylamide, respectively, K SV is the Stern-Volmer constant for collisional quenching, and [Q] is the concentration of the quencher. The equation predicts a linear plot ofF o/F versus[Q] for a homogeneous solution (28Birks J.B. Photophysics of Aromatic Molecules. Wiley-Interscience, New York1970Google Scholar). The depth measurement was performed according to parallax analysis (29Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5312-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Chattopadhyay A. London E.

Specifically, the distance of the tryptophan residue from the bilayer center (Z CF) is given by Equation2:ZCF=LC1+[−ln(F1/F2)/πC−L2]/2LEquation 2 where L C1 represents the distance from the bilayer center to the shallow quencher (11 Å for 6,7-Br2-PC), C is the mole fraction of the quencher divided by the lipid area (70 Å2),F 1 and F 2 are the relative fluorescence intensities of the shallow (6,7-Br2-PC) and deep quenchers (11,12-Br2-PC), respectively, and L is the difference in the depth of the two quenchers (0.9 Å per CH2 or CBr2group). For these brominated lipids the thickness of the hydrophobic region is ∼29 Å (32McIntosh T.J. Holloway P.W. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Our first goals were to confirm whether the C2A domain of synaptotagmin possesses all of the PS/PC binding activity of the intact cytoplasmic domain of the protein (24Chapman E.R. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5735-5741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Chapman E.R.

Structural studies indicate that five acidic amino acid residues (Asp-172, -178, -230, -232, and -238) serve as critical Ca2+ ligands within C2A (8Sutton R.B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). These ligands are precisely conserved in the C2B domain (7Perin M. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, neutralization of any of the acidic Ca2+ ligands within C2A, by substitution with Asn or Ser residues, abolished Ca2+-triggered PS/PC liposome binding activity of the intact cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin. These data are consistent with studies of the isolated C2A domain (27Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Zhang X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 57: 12395-12403Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast, neutralization of four of the five putative Ca2+ ligands in the C2B domain (D309N/D363N/D365N/D371N) had little effect on Ca2+-triggered PS/PC-binding activity (Fig. 1 A). These data indicate that Ca2+-triggered PS/PC binding activity is regulated by Ca2+ ligands within C2A. A previous report indicated that Asp residue 178 was not essential for Ca2+-triggered binding of the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin to syntaxin (33Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ca2+-triggered interactions with lipids and with SNAREs can be uncoupled. However, other reports indicated that the interaction of the isolated C2A domain of synaptotagmin with syntaxin was abolished by neutralization of Asp-178 (36Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). We have re-examined this issue by assaying the ability of wild type and mutant forms of the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin to assemble onto the core of the ternary SNARE complex composed of syntaxin, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin. The fully assembled SDS-resistant SNARE complex (20Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig.1 B (right upper panel). Because both C2 domains of synaptotagmin are critical for high affinity interactions with SNAREs (12Davis A.F. Bai J. Fasshauer D. Wolowick M.J. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 363-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 14Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6328-6336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we analyzed three synaptotagmin mutants. Two mutants possessed mutations in the Ca2+ ligands within the C2A domain (D178N and D230,232N) and in the third mutant four of the five conserved Ca2+ ligands within the C2B domain were neutralized (D309N/D363N/D365N/D371N). Each mutant was assayed for co-immunoprecipitation with assembled SNARE complexes using anti-synaptobrevin antibodies in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 1 B (left panel), wild type and D309N/D363N/D365N/D371N mutant synaptotagmin bound to the SNARE complex in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Consistent with previous reports of synaptotagmin·syntaxin interactions (33Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), the D178N mutant also bound to the SNARE complex in response to Ca2+. However, 50% of the Ca2+effect was inhibited by this mutation. In contrast, the D230,232N mutant did not exhibit any Ca2+-promoted SNARE complex binding activity but did retain the Ca2+-independent component of binding activity. These data are plotted in Fig.1 B (right lower panel) and demonstrate that, analogous to the binding of anionic phospholipids, all of the Ca2+ ligands that regulate binding to the SNARE complex lie within the C2A domain. However, the D178N mutation can uncouple Ca2+-triggered synaptotagmin·lipid interactions from Ca2+-triggered synaptotagmin·SNARE complex interactions, indicating that these interactions have distinct structural requirements. To formally confirm that C2A mediates all of the anionic phospholipid binding activity of synaptotagmin, equimolar amounts of the cytoplasmic domain (designated C2AB), as well as the isolated C2A and C2B domains, were immobilized as GST fusion proteins and assayed for radiolabeled liposome binding activity in the presence and absence of Ca2+. As shown in Fig.2 A, C2A bound liposomes to the same extent as did C2AB; C2B did not bind liposomes in response to Ca2+. Having established that all of the anionic phospholipid binding activity of synaptotagmin is mediated by the C2A domain, we next sought to generate an optical reporter to follow C2A·membrane interactions using synaptotagmin that has been reconstituted into proteoliposomes via its N-terminal transmembrane segment. The goal of these experiments is to determine whether C2A interacts with the same membrane in which synaptotagmin is embedded (a “cis” interaction) or whether C2A interacts with protein free target vesicles (a “trans” interaction). We therefore prepared a C2A domain that includes the transmembrane segment of synaptotagmin and encompasses amino acids 1–265, where residues 58–79 correspond to the transmembrane anchor and residues 140–265 form the C2A domain. Two versions of this domain were prepared, a wild type (C2A-TMRWT) and mutant form (C2A-TMRTrp) in which all native Trp residues were replaced with phenylalanines, and phenylalanine 234, within Ca2+- and lipid-binding loop 3, was substituted with a tryptophan residue. Thus, C2A-TMRTrpcontains a single Trp reporter, which we have shown in a previous study penetrates into lipid bilayers in response to binding Ca2+(11, 12). Membrane penetration results in an increase in fluorescence intensity and a blue shift in the emission spectrum of the Trp reporter, thus providing a convenient means to monitor Ca2+-triggered C2A·lipid interactions in real-time. C2A-TMR and C2A-TMRTrp bound liposomes to the same extent as the isolated C2A domain of synaptotagmin (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the Ca2+ sensitivities of C2A, C2A-TMR, and C2A-TMRTrp for binding liposomes were identical (Fig.2 B; [Ca2+]1/2 ∼ 20–21 μm; Hill coefficient 1.9–2.2). These data indicate that C2A-TMRTrp is fully active and is suitable for use in reconstitution experiments, as described below. To determine whether C2A docks onto the same membrane in which synaptotagmin is embedded (i.e. the synaptic vesicle membrane; designated here as a cis interaction) or whether synaptotagmin docks onto a distinct target membrane (i.e. the presynaptic plasma membrane; designated here as atrans interaction) C2A-TMRTrp was generated as a His6-tagged protein and reconstituted into proteoliposomes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The degree of successful reconstitution was assayed by sedimentation of C2A-TMRTrp proteoliposomes under various conditions. As shown in Fig. 3 A, in HEPES buffer II, all of the C2A-TMRTrp co-sedimented with proteoliposomes. Addition of 1 m salt, a high pH buffer (pH 11) or 5 m urea failed to solubilize the protein, indicating that C2A-TMRTrp was efficiently embedded into proteoliposomes. Surprisingly, 2% Triton solubilized only 50% of the C2A-TMRTrp. Addition of a chaotropic agent (5 murea) or a reducing agent (10 mm DTT) to the 2% Triton buffer resulted in complete solubilization. These data indicate that a secondary process contributes to the sedimentation of C2A-TMRTrp in the co-sedimentation assay. Therefore, before carrying out the cis/trans analysis described further below, we"

Ca2+-activated K+ reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) phosphate-buffered saline pascal(s) During tooth development, odontoblasts originating from the neural crest are the cells responsible for the dentin formation (1Lumsden A.G.S. Development. 1988; 103: 155-169PubMed Google Scholar). These highly polarized cells synthesize the dentin organic matrix made of collagen and noncollagenous macromolecules, which further mineralize. They play a central role in the transport and accumulation of calcium to the mineralization front (2Linde A. Lundgren T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 213-222PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that the calcium pathway for dentin formation involves plasma membrane Ca2+channels, because specific calcium channel blockers dramatically impair Ca2+ transport into dentin mineral (3Lundgren T. Linde A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1997; 60: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Besides these Ca2+ channels, Na+, K+, and recently Cl− channels have also been described in human dental pulp cells cultured in vitro or odontoblasts isolated by enzyme treatment (4Davidson R.M. Arch. Oral Biol. 1993; 38: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5Davidson R.M. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Guo L. Davidson R.M. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 350-351Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is suggested that these channels play a role in calcium homeostasis as well as in the cellular mechanisms underlying sensory transduction in teeth, a phenomenon that still remains unclear. Indeed, sensory axons have been identified in close contact with the odontoblast bodies or processes corresponding to the proximal end of the cells and running within the mineralized dentin tubules (for review, see Ref. 7Hildebrand C. Fried K. Tuisku F. Johansson C.S. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1995; 45: 165-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, it is thought that a transductive mechanism for somatic sensation could exist via ion channels in odontoblasts. However, because they form a layer of cells close to the dentin, in situ electrophysiological studies of ion channels in odontoblasts as well as interaction between odontoblastic and neuronal elements proved to be impossible.We recently developed a unique cell culture system allowing the differentiation of human dental pulp cells into odontoblasts at both the morphological and functional levels (8Couble M.L. Farges J.C. Bleicher F. Perrat-Mabillon B. Boudeulle M. Magloire H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2000; 66: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of this cell culture system to use the patch clamp recording techniques to examine, at the single channel level, the characteristics of ion channels in the plasma membrane of odontoblasts. We focus in this paper on high conductance Ca2+-activated K+(KCa)1 channels. Indeed, these channels have been found to be present in the plasma membrane of different cell types and implicated in the regulation of a variety of functions, such as cell firing in neurons, secretion in endocrine or exocrine cells, and myogenic tone in arterial smooth muscle (9Blatz A.L.

The gene encoding the pore-forming α-subunit of this channel was first cloned in Drosophila (14Atkinson N.S. Robertson G.A. Ganetzky B. Science. 1991; 253: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and later from various species, including human (HSLO) (15Dworetzky S.I. Trojnacki J.T. Griboff V.K. Mol.

Furthermore, using RT-PCR,in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry techniques, we provide evidence for the expression and distribution of KCa channels at strategic locations in odontoblastsin vivo.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we report that KCa channels are present in odontoblasts in culture originating from human dental pulp. Our cell culture system allowed us to unambiguously experiment on highly differentiated odontoblasts (8Couble M.L. Farges J.C. Bleicher F. Perrat-Mabillon B. Boudeulle M. Magloire H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2000; 66: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We showed that odontoblast KCa channels are weakly active in on-cell patches even at highly depolarized membrane potentials but can be activated by applying suction in the pipette or in response to an osmotic shock applied to the cell. KCa channel activity was already described in human pulp cells in culture and dissociated odontoblasts from rat, but questions remain about the identity of the cells under study (4Davidson R.M. Arch. Oral Biol. 1993; 38: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Guo L. Davidson R.M. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 350-351Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that these channels displayed mechanosensitivity. However, these data were obtained in excised patches in the presence of activating [Ca2+] at the cytoplasmic face, and we could not exclude that stretch sensitivity resulted from some alteration of subsarcolemmal components subsequent to patch excision. We showed that stretch activation could be revealed in the absence of calcium at the external face of the membrane (see Fig. 3 B). This indicates that the increase in channel activity in response to membrane stretch was not the consequence of an influx of calcium via stretch-activated channels or stretch-induced Ca2+ leak. We cannot rule out a possible transduction via intracellular second messenger systems or cytosolic factors. However, the fact that stretch-induced activation was also observed in excised patches favors the hypothesis according to which the membrane stretch directly affects the odontoblast KCa channel protein itself or a membrane component closely related to the channel. Activation of KCa channels in response to membrane stretch and not mediated by an increase in Ca2+ entry has also been observed in osteoblast-like cells, renal cells, smooth and skeletal muscle cells, and neurons (19Davidson R.M.

In these preparations, channel activation was observed in the same range of pressure as in odontoblasts, i.e. half-maximal activation was achieved at pressures around −3 kPa.In agreement with our electrophysiological data, PCR experiments andin situ hybridization performed in cultured odontoblasts demonstrated expression of the transcripts of the HSLO gene encoding the pore-forming α-subunit of KCa channels. Additionally, the presence of the channel protein was confirmed with specific antibodies. More importantly, using in situhybridization experiments, we showed that the HSLO gene was expressed by odontoblasts in vivo. Transcripts were also detected in nerve terminals as well as in vascular smooth muscle cells. These latter distributions are not surprising, because KCachannels have been shown to be involved in the regulation of smooth muscle tone and excitability of nerve terminals in central and sensory neurons (16Tseng-Crank J.

Dwortzky S.I. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 37: 319-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In odontoblasts as well as in nerve terminals and vascular smooth muscle cells, a relatively weak signal was detected. Similar findings were reported by Rosenblatt et al. (25Rosenblatt K.P. Sun Z.P. Heller S. Hudspeth A.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1061-1075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) using in situ hybridization in cochlea, nerve terminals, and vascular smooth muscle cells despite a well established functional expression of these channels in these different cell types. These results could indicate that the KCa channel protein undergoes a low turnover.In vivo immunocytochemical experiments showed that the channel protein was strongly expressed at the apical pole of the cells. Interestingly, the localization correlates to the spatial distribution of l-type Ca2+ channels. Odontoblasts actively transport calcium to the mineralization front of the dentin matrix. This process is known to take place at the apical pole of the cell and is thought to involve voltage-dependent l-type Ca2+ channels (3Lundgren T. Linde A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1997; 60: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Seux D. Joffre A. Fosset M. Magloire H. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported (27Guo L. Davidson R.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1357-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that extracellular Ca2+ increased intracellular free Ca2+ through a mechanism involving both influx of external Ca2+ via l-type Ca2+ channels as well as release of Ca2+ from internal stores. Colocalization of Ca2+ and KCa channels at the apical pole suggests that KCa channels could exert a negative control of calcium entry by hyperpolarizing odontoblasts and closing voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in response to an increase in intracellular Ca2+.The presence of KCa channels displaying mechanosensitivity in odontoblasts could also have relevance in the sensory transduction phenomenon in teeth. Mechanical stimulation of odontoblasts and fluid flow in dentinal tubules are known to elicit nociceptive responses (28Dong W.K. Chundler E.H. Martin R.F. Brain Res. 1985; 334: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar,29Jyväsjärvi E. Kniffki K.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 411: 663-675Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Additionally, changes in osmotic gradient or probing dentin were shown to increase the discharge rate of pulp cells and evoke action potentials in their primary afferents. Afferent nerve terminals are known to coil around odontoblasts, and the close association of odontoblast processes and nerve endings (30Byers M.R. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1984; 25: 39-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 31Ibuki T. Kido M.A. Kiyoshima T. Terada Y. Tanaka T. J. Dent. Res. 1996; 75: 1963-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) has presupposed an interaction between these cells as the earliest step of tooth pain transmission. Stretch-activated KCa channels could be involved in this process. We found that KCa channels open in response to an osmotic shock, which was also recently found to induce an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ in living odontoblasts from sliced dental pulp (32Shibukawa Y. Susuki T. Bull. Tokyo Dent. Coll. 1997; 38: 177-185PubMed Google Scholar). It can be postulated that, in response to mechanical stimuli, the combination of increased intracellular Ca2+ plus membrane stretch could cause KCa channel opening in odontoblasts. The resulted elevation in the extracellular [K+] in the restricted cleft delimited by the neuronal and odontoblast membranes may depolarize the nerve endings and lower threshold for nerve firing in the sensory tract. This could explain why K+-containing agents placed into deep dentinal cavities induce a brief burst of high frequency activity in the intradental nerves (33Markowitz K. Bilotto G. Kim S. Arch. Oral Biol. 1991; 36: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).In conclusion, the results presented here show that in vitrodifferentiated human odontoblasts express mechanosensitive KCa channels. The HSLO transcripts coding for the α-subunit constituting the pore of these channels are expressed in odontoblasts in vivo. The preferential localization of the Slo protein at the apical pole of the cells in vivosuggests a role of KCa channels in the mineralization process and in the mechanotransduction of fluid displacement within dentinal tubules into electrical cell signals. During tooth development, odontoblasts originating from the neural crest are the cells responsible for the dentin formation (1Lumsden A.G.S. Development. 1988; 103: 155-169PubMed Google Scholar). These highly polarized cells synthesize the dentin organic matrix made of collagen and noncollagenous macromolecules, which further mineralize. They play a central role in the transport and accumulation of calcium to the mineralization front (2Linde A. Lundgren T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 213-222PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that the calcium pathway for dentin formation involves plasma membrane Ca2+channels, because specific calcium channel blockers dramatically impair Ca2+ transport into dentin mineral (3Lundgren T. Linde A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1997; 60: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Besides these Ca2+ channels, Na+, K+, and recently Cl− channels have also been described in human dental pulp cells cultured in vitro or odontoblasts isolated by enzyme treatment (4Davidson R.M. Arch. Oral Biol. 1993; 38: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5Davidson R.M. Arch. Oral Biol. 1994; 39: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Guo L. Davidson R.M. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 350-351Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is suggested that these channels play a role in calcium homeostasis as well as in the cellular mechanisms underlying sensory transduction in teeth, a phenomenon that still remains unclear. Indeed, sensory axons have been identified in close contact with the odontoblast bodies or processes corresponding to the proximal end of the cells and running within the mineralized dentin tubules (for review, see Ref. 7Hildebrand C. Fried K. Tuisku F. Johansson C.S. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 1995; 45: 165-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, it is thought that a transductive mechanism for somatic sensation could exist via ion channels in odontoblasts. However, because they form a layer of cells close to the dentin, in situ electrophysiological studies of ion channels in odontoblasts as well as interaction between odontoblastic and neuronal elements proved to be impossible. We recently developed a unique cell culture system allowing the differentiation of human dental pulp cells into odontoblasts at both the morphological and functional levels (8Couble M.L. Farges J.C. Bleicher F. Perrat-Mabillon B. Boudeulle M. Magloire H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2000; 66: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of this cell culture system to use the patch clamp recording techniques to examine, at the single channel level, the characteristics of ion channels in the plasma membrane of odontoblasts. We focus in this paper on high conductance Ca2+-activated K+(KCa)1 channels. Indeed, these channels have been found to be present in the plasma membrane of different cell types and implicated in the regulation of a variety of functions, such as cell firing in neurons, secretion in endocrine or exocrine cells, and myogenic tone in arterial smooth muscle (9Blatz A.L. Magleby K.L. Trends Neurosci. 1987; 10: 463-467Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 10Latorre R. Oberhauser A. Labarca P. Alvarez O. Ann. Rev.

Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 321-329Google Scholar). Their basic characteristic is that channel opening is induced by an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] as well as membrane depolarization. The gene encoding the pore-forming α-subunit of this channel was first cloned in Drosophila (14Atkinson N.S. Robertson G.A. Ganetzky B. Science. 1991; 253: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and later from various species, including human (HSLO) (15Dworetzky S.I. Trojnacki J.T. Griboff V.K. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 27: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D. Krause J.D. Mertz R. Godinot N. Dichiara T.J. Reinhart P.H.

Receptors Channels. 1995; 3: 185-199PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate here, in on-cell patches, that these K+channels display mechanosensitivity. Furthermore, using RT-PCR,in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry techniques, we provide evidence for the expression and distribution of KCa channels at strategic locations in odontoblastsin vivo. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we report that KCa channels are present in odontoblasts in culture originating from human dental pulp. Our cell culture system allowed us to unambiguously experiment on highly differentiated odontoblasts (8Couble M.L. Farges J.C. Bleicher F. Perrat-Mabillon B. Boudeulle M. Magloire H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2000; 66: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We showed that odontoblast KCa channels are weakly active in on-cell patches even at highly depolarized membrane potentials but can be activated by applying suction in the pipette or in response to an osmotic shock applied to the cell. KCa channel activity was already described in human pulp cells in culture and dissociated odontoblasts from rat, but questions remain about the identity of the cells under study (4Davidson R.M. Arch. Oral Biol. 1993; 38: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 6Guo L. Davidson R.M. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 350-351Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that these channels displayed mechanosensitivity. However, these data were obtained in excised patches in the presence of activating [Ca2+] at the cytoplasmic face, and we could not exclude that stretch sensitivity resulted from some alteration of subsarcolemmal components subsequent to patch excision. We showed that stretch activation could be revealed in the absence of calcium at the external face of the membrane (see Fig. 3 B). This indicates that the increase in channel activity in response to membrane stretch was not the consequence of an influx of calcium via stretch-activated channels or stretch-induced Ca2+ leak. We cannot rule out a possible transduction via intracellular second messenger systems or cytosolic factors. However, the fact that stretch-induced activation was also observed in excised patches favors the hypothesis according to which the membrane stretch directly affects the odontoblast KCa channel protein itself or a membrane component closely related to the channel. Activation of KCa channels in response to membrane stretch and not mediated by an increase in Ca2+ entry has also been observed in osteoblast-like cells, renal cells, smooth and skeletal muscle cells, and neurons (19Davidson R.M. Tatakis D.W. Auerbach A.L. Pflügers Arch. 1990; 416: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Pacha J. Frindt G. Sackin H. Palmer L.G. Am. J.

https://openalex.org/W2042628318,"Chimeric Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) is characterized by a serine-threonine kinase domain, an autoinhibitory domain, a calmodulin-binding domain and a neural visinin-like domain with three EF-hands. The neural visinin-like Ca2+-binding domain at the C-terminal end of the CaM-binding domain makes CCaMK unique among all the known calmodulin-dependent kinases. Biological functions of the plant visinin-like proteins or visinin-like domains in plant proteins are not well known. Using EF-hand deletions in the visinin-like domain, we found that the visinin-like domain regulated Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation of CCaMK. To investigate the effects of Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation on the interaction with calmodulin, the equilibrium binding constants of CCaMK were measured by fluorescence emission anisotropy using dansylated calmodulin. Binding was 8-fold tighter after Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation. This shift in affinity did not occur in CCaMK deletion mutants lacking Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation. A variable calmodulin affinity regulated by Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation mediated through the visinin-like domain is a new regulatory mechanism for CCaMK activation and calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. Our experiments demonstrate the existence of two functional molecular switches in a protein kinase regulating the kinase activity, namely a visinin-like domain acting as a Ca2+-triggered switch and a CaM-binding domain acting as an autophosphorylation-triggered molecular switch. Chimeric Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) is characterized by a serine-threonine kinase domain, an autoinhibitory domain, a calmodulin-binding domain and a neural visinin-like domain with three EF-hands.

Biological functions of the plant visinin-like proteins or visinin-like domains in plant proteins are not well known. Using EF-hand deletions in the visinin-like domain, we found that the visinin-like domain regulated Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation of CCaMK. To investigate the effects of Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation on the interaction with calmodulin, the equilibrium binding constants of CCaMK were measured by fluorescence emission anisotropy using dansylated calmodulin. Binding was 8-fold tighter after Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation. This shift in affinity did not occur in CCaMK deletion mutants lacking Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation. A variable calmodulin affinity regulated by Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation mediated through the visinin-like domain is a new regulatory mechanism for CCaMK activation and calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. Our experiments demonstrate the existence of two functional molecular switches in a protein kinase regulating the kinase activity, namely a visinin-like domain acting as a Ca2+-triggered switch and a CaM-binding domain acting as an autophosphorylation-triggered molecular switch. calmodulin dansylated calmodulin stimulated autophosphorylation Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II visinin-like domain Ca2+/CaM1-dependent protein phosphorylation is believed to play a pivotal role in amplifying and diversifying Ca2+/CaM-mediated signals and has been implicated in regulating a broad range of physiological and developmental processes in animals (1Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1993; 12: 185-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A number of different kinds of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases have been cloned and characterized from animal systems (2Wang W. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12001-12008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Understanding of CaM-regulated protein kinase systems as mediators in Ca2+-signal transduction in plants is very limited. The predominant forms of Ca2+-regulated protein kinases in plants are Ca2+-dependent but CaM-independent protein kinases, and they are widely expressed and abundant in plants (3Roberts D.M. Harmon A.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 375-414Crossref Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 4Harper J.F. Sussman M.R. Schaller G.E. Putnam-Evans C. Charbonneau H. Harmon A.C. Science. 1991; 252: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Three Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases sharing some features of mammalian multifunctional protein kinase (CaMK II) have been reported to exist in plants (5Watillon B. Kettmann R. Boxus P. Burny A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1381-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Patil S.D. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Planta. 1996; 199: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), but only chimeric Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) isolated from lily (6Patil S.D. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) has the neural visinin-like Ca2+-binding domain. CCaMK is highly tissue-specific and developmentally regulated (8Poovaiah B.W. Xia M. Liu Z. Wang W. Yang T. Sathyanarayanan P.V. Franceschi V.R. Planta. 1999; 209: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization has revealed that it requires both Ca2+/CaM for activation (9Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CCaMK has a serine-threonine kinase domain, a regulatory domain consisting of an autoinhibitory domain and a CaM-binding domain (highly similar to mammalian CaMK II), and a neural visinin-like Ca2+-binding domain (6Patil S.D. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Neural visinin-like Ca2+-binding proteins are members of a family of Ca2+-sensitive regulators, which include frequenin, neurocalcin, and hippocalcin and have not been reported to exist in plants (6Patil S.D. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These proteins are activated at nanomolar concentrations of Ca2+ (10Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso. 1998; 43 Suppl. 12: 1681-1687Google Scholar), and they are not reported to exist as chimeric proteins or to be associated with any CaM kinases in animal systems. The C-terminal visinin-like Ca2+-binding domain of CCaMK makes this kinase unique among all other Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinases known in animal and plant systems and raises the question of its role in regulating the kinase activity. Here we demonstrate that Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation, mediated by the C-terminal neural visinin-like domain, significantly tightens the binding of CaM to CCaMK. This increase in affinity is autophosphorylation-dependent and also Ca2+-dependent. We also show that EF-hand deletions in the visinin-like domain abolish autophosphorylation and increased affinity for CaM. The neural visinin-like domain of CCaMK could function as a Ca2+-sensitive switch regulating autophosphorylation and CaM affinity. Our results demonstrate for the first time the autophosphorylation-dependent changes in affinity for CaM by a plant protein kinase. CCaMK cDNA from lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb cv. Nellie White) and deletion mutants were cloned in pET3b vector (Novagen, Inc.) and expressed in Escherichia coli. These proteins were purified as described previously (9Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Potato calmodulin PCM1 cDNA cloned in expression vector pET3b was labeled using [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) as described by Fromm and Chua (11Fromm H. Chua N.H. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 199-206Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar).35S-Labeled CaM was purified from bacteria using phenyl-Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography (11Fromm H. Chua N.H. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 199-206Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation assay of CCaMK and deletion mutants were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm [32P]ATP, and either 2.5 mmEGTA or 0.2 mm CaCl2 (9Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The autophosphorylated CCaMK and mutants were analyzed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the [32P]PO4 incorporation were measured by isolating the protein bands from the gels and counting them using a scintillation counter. The data were analyzed using the parameter SAP (stimulated autophosphorylation) index, which is the ratio of [32P]PO4 incorporation (autophosphorylation) in the presence of Ca2+ to the [32P]PO4 incorporation in the absence of Ca2+. The data were plotted using SIGMAPLOT software (Jandel Scientific). CCaMK with or without autophosphorylation were spotted on to nitrocellulose filters (Millipore). CaM binding was assessed by incubating these nitrocellulose filters containing CCaMK with 35S-CaM (0.5 × 106 cpm/μg) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk), plus either 1 mm Ca2+ or 5 mm EGTA as described previously (9Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Dansyl CaM was prepared as described (12Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Briefly purified CaM (PCM1) was incubated with an approximately 4-fold molar excess of dansyl chloride (Pierce) for 45 min at room temperature (12Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) (10 mg/ml CaM, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 9.0). Unreacted dansyl chloride was then separated from dansylated CaM by dialysis (Spectrapor 1, Spectrum Medical Industries) against dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 m NaCl and 0.1 mm EGTA). CaM species with different amounts of labeling were separated by fast protein liquid chromatography (Macro Prep t-Butyl HIC column, Bio-Rad) in an ammonium sulfate gradient (1.2 m to 0 m; 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0, present in both buffers). Fractions were collected, and the concentration of CaM-D was estimated by absorbance and the Bradford method. Each fraction was tested for Ca2+binding-induced changes in anisotropy (see below). The fractions that showed changes in anisotropy upon Ca2+ binding were designated as CaM-D and used for all studies. The CaM-D was used in substrate phosphorylation experiments using histone II AS (Sigma) as substrate as described previously (9Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and found to be capable of stimulating kinase activity. All reagents used for fluorescence measurements were screened for fluorescence impurities, treated with CaM-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to deplete endogenous Ca2+, and filtered using a 0.2-μm filter. Autophosphorylated CCaMK for anisotropy measurements was prepared as described above using 2 μm ATP or AMP-PNP. Fluorescence anisotropy was measured in a T-format using an SLM 4800 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 335 nm, and the excitation bandpass was 4 nm. Emitted light was collected without a monochromator through a 400-nm Schott low cut-off filter. Experiments were performed at 30 °C in 100-μl cuvettes. Anisotropy was calculated using SLM software. Data plotted are the values obtained after about 10 consecutive averages (integrated for 1 s). We used fluorescence anisotropy as an index of the fraction of fluorescent calmodulin (CaM-D) bound to the kinase. The equations used for this analysis were taken from Ref. 13Lundbald J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612PubMed Google Scholar to determine the value of K, the equilibrium association constant for a simple non-cooperative binding isotherm. At any kinase concentration (L), Fb = fraction of CaM-D bound to the kinase can be obtained from Equation 1. Fb=(A−Af)/(Ab−Af)Equation 1 The measured anisotropy (A) is from a titration where CaM-D concentration is kept constant (10 nm) and less than the binding constant for the kinase while the kinase concentration (L) is varied. Af is the anisotropy of the free CaM-D, and Ab is the anisotropy of bound CaM-D. Ab was determined in an independent experiment where the concentration of the kinase was sufficient to >95% saturate the CaM-D. In our case, the quantum yield of bound CaM-D is not equal to the quantum yield of the free CaM-D. Therefore, Equation 1 must be modified to account for this (Equation 2). Fb=(A−Af)/[(Ab−A)X+A−Af]Equation 2 X is the ratio of quantum yield of the bound to the quantum yield of the free CaM-D. X was determined in an independent experiment to be 1.9 by the following procedure. The fluorescence intensities for free and bound CaM-D (see above) were determined at two different emission polarizer settings, 90° and 0°, to obtain Iperpendicular and Iparallel, respectively. The absolute intensities for each sample were then calculated from Equation 3. Iabsolute=Iparallel+2(Iperpendicular)Equation 3 The ratio (Iabsolute bound)/(Iabsolute free) =X. Equation 4 can be used for a simple binding isotherm, where L approximates Ltotal, which is true in our case because the CaM-D concentration (10 nm) is less than the binding constant for the kinase. Fb=KL/(1+KL)Equation 4 Therefore, the relationship between A and L, in terms of K, can be obtained by rearranging Equation 2 and substituting in Equation 4, as shown below. A=Fb(XAb−Af)+Af1+XFb−FbEquation 5 The anisotropy (A) versus kinase concentration (L) plots were fit (SigmaPlot) to this equation to obtain K, Ab , and Af by giving initial parameter estimates of these variables. The fitted values for Ab and Af were in reasonable agreement with those determined experimentally. The fits to the data did not appreciably change by fixing Ab and Af to the experimentally determined values. The role of the neural visinin-like domain in regulating CCaMK was investigated. Here we report the effect of successive EF-hand deletions from the COOH terminus of the visinin-like domain on autophosphorylation and CaM activation of CCaMK. The autophosphorylation of three mutants lacking one, two, or three EF-hands were performed as described and analyzed using the parameter SAP. This is the ratio of [32P]PO4incorporation (autophosphorylation) in the presence of Ca2+to the [32P]PO4 incorporation in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1; Table. 1). The SAP index values for all the EF-hand deletion mutants were almost unity (Fig. 1). However, wild type CCaMK showed a 4.8-fold increase in autophosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+ and ATP. Presence of 2.5 mm EGTA in the phosphorylation assay mixture abolished Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation of wild type CCaMK. Previous studies from our laboratory (14Ramachandiran S. Takezawa D. Wang W. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have shown that binding of Ca2+/CaM releases autoinhibition (intrasteric regulation) making CCaMK fully active. The effect of autophosphorylation of CCaMK on interaction with CaM was investigated (Fig. 2). Equilibrium binding of CaM-D was monitored by fluorescence emission anisotropy measurements in solution. The rotational correlation time of free CaM-D (mass 17 kDa) is increased upon binding of CCaMK (mass 57 kDa). This change in correlation time is reflected in the anisotropy and can be used to quantitate the equilibrium binding constant (13Lundbald J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the increase in anisotropy of CaM-D (10 nm) as the kinase concentration was increased from 0 to 160 nm. The dissociation constants were calculated to fit the anisotropy data as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This showed that autophosphorylation tightens the binding by approximately a factor of 8 (see Table II). Competitive binding studies using unlabeled CaM showed a large decrease in anisotropy (Fig. 2) in the presence of excess (1:100) unlabeled CaM, 0.2 mm Ca2+, 2 μm ATP, and autophosphorylated CCaMK.Table IIEquilibrium dissociation constants (K d) for binding of CaM-D to CCaMK and deletion mutantsConstructKdUnphosphorylated + 0.2 mmCa2+Autophosphorylated + 0.2 mmCa2+, 2 μm ATPControl + 2.5 mm EGTAnmnmnmWild type55.3 (0.3)6.5 (0.4)>400M1(1–356)61.9 (0.2)55.6 (0.6)>400M2(1–438)51.5 (0.4)56.4 (0.4)>400M3(1–482)49.7 (0.4)50.1 (0.4)>400These data were calculated from Figs. 2 and 4 (A–C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the average calculated from four titrations.

Open table in a new tab These data were calculated from Figs. 2 and 4 (A–C) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the average calculated from four titrations. Standard deviation is given in parentheses. We used an unhydrolyzable ATP analog (AMP-PNP) to study whether the increase in affinity for CaM is due to binding of ATP to the kinase active site or due to the consequent autophosphorylation of the kinase. Incubation of CCaMK with 0.2 mm Ca2+ and 2 μm AMP-PNP in the assay mixture containing 10 nm CaM-D did not show any significant changes in anisotropy values (Fig. 2) compared with those in the absence of ATP (assay mixture containing 10 nm CaM-D and 0.2 mmCa2+). Deletion mutants of CCaMK were used to test whether Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation is a prerequisite for the variable affinity for CaM and to study contributions of visinin-like domain. The three deletion mutants (Fig.1) were used to carry out fluorescence anisotropy measurements (Fig. 4,A–C). Interestingly, none of the three EF-hand deletion mutants showed any increase in affinity for CaM-D in the presence of 0.2 mm Ca2+ and 2 μm ATP (Table II). These mutants showed Ca2+-dependent interaction with CaM-D, suggesting a functional CaM binding site. As an additional measure to test the autophosphorylation-dependent changes in the affinity for CaM by CCaMK, we performed filter-binding experiments using35S-labeled CaM as described. Our data suggested a significant increase in CaM binding upon autophosphorylation of CCaMK (Fig. 3) compared with unphosphorylated controls. Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation of CCaMK and different EF-hand deletion mutants were analyzed using SAP index. We found this index very useful to compare the extent of stimulation of different mutants by Ca2+. The SAP index values for all the EF-hand deletion mutants were almost unity (Fig. 1, TableI). However, wild type CCaMK showed a 4.8-fold increase in autophosphorylation in the presence of Ca2+ and ATP. The results of the successive deletions in the visinin-like domain suggest that the third EF-hand is absolutely essential for the functioning of the visinin-like domain. We expected that the mutant M1 with all three EF-hands deleted would show Ca2+/CaM-dependent autophosphorylation similar to CaMK II (15Colbran R.J. Schworer C.M. Hashimoto Y. Fong Y.L. Rich D.P. Smith M.K. Soderling T.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) because the kinase domain and CaM-binding domain of CCaMK and CaMK 11 are highly similar (9Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) at the amino acid level (although they have different C-terminal domains). In CaMK II, deletion of the C-terminal association domain does not have any effect on Ca2+/CaM-dependent autophosphorylation. Interestingly, the Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation was absent in this mutant, indicating a different mechanism of autophosphorylation operating for CCaMK unlike other CaM-dependent kinases. The PROFILE scan analysis on Ca2+-binding sites of the c-terminal visinin-like domain (normalized scores: EF hand 1: 7.6, EF hand 2: 9.3, EF hand 3: 10.3) suggest that different EF-hands may have different affinities for Ca2+. However, we did not detect any intermediary levels of autophosphorylation (in terms of SAP index values) with different EF-hand deletions under the conditions tested (Fig. 1). Reduction in Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation upon deletions in the visinin-like domain (VLD) could be explained by either the loss of autophosphorylation sites due to deletions in the VLD or due to lack of Ca2+ binding to VLD. We have observed from the cyanogen bromide cleavage experiments 2P. V. Sathyanarayanan, W. F. Siems, and B. W. Poovaiah, manuscript in preparation. that the autophosphorylation sites are around the calmodulin-binding domain of CCaMK and not in the VLD. Thus, the decreased Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation is most likely due to lack of calcium binding to the VLD. A biological function for visinin-like proteins in plants or visinin-like domains in plant proteins is not well known. Visinin-like Ca2+-binding proteins are members of a family of Ca2+-sensitive regulators, which include frequenin, neurocalcin, and hippocalcin and are activated at nanomolar concentrations of Ca2+ (6Patil S.D. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 10Kobayashi M. Takamatsu K. Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso. 1998; 43 Suppl. 12: 1681-1687Google Scholar). Comparison of amino acid sequence of the visinin-like domain (amino acids 338–520) of CCaMK with neural visinin-like calcium-binding protein shows 52–54% sequence similarity and 32–35% sequence identity (6Patil S.D. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our autophosphorylation data (Fig. 1) suggests that the visinin-like domain of CCaMK acts as a Ca2+-sensitive switch and that the third EF hand is important in regulating Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation.Table IDependence of Ca 2+ upon the autophosphorylation of CCaMK and CCaMK deletion mutantsConstructAutophosphorylationSAP index+ Ca2+−Ca2+cpmWild type1142 ± 28238 ± 94.8 ± 0.2M1(1–356)41 ± 642 ± 81.0 ± 0.2M2(1–438)73 ± 772 ± 91.0 ± 0.2M3(1–482)166 ± 8159 ± 81.0 ± 0.1Autophosphorylation was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cpm shown are the average and standard deviation of four gel slice measurements for each sample.

We performed fluorescence emission anisotropy measurements using dansylated calmodulin to quantitate the interaction between calmodulin and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the kinase. In the presence of 0.2 mm Ca2+, addition of nonphosphorylated kinase to the assay mixture containing 10 nm CaM-D resulted in a significant increase in anisotropy indicating Ca2+-dependent interaction between CaM-D and nonphosphorylated CCaMK (Fig. 2). Such an increase in anisotropy was absent when nonphosphorylated CCaMK was added to the assay mixture containing 2.5 mm EGTA. In the presence of 0.2 mm Ca2+ and 2 μm ATP, addition of autophosphorylated kinase resulted in a very large increase in anisotropy (Fig. 2). The anisotropy data were analyzed as described and the dissociation constants were calculated (TableII). The dissociation constant for CaM-D was changed from 55.3 nm to 6.5 nm upon autophosphorylation of CCaMK. This significant increase in anisotropy due to the addition of autophosphorylated kinase is Ca2+-dependent and reversible as evident from the large decrease in anisotropy when the free Ca2+ was lowered to less than 100 nm by the addition of EGTA (data not shown). Competitive binding studies using unlabeled CaM showed a large decrease in anisotropy (Fig. 2) in the presence of excess (1:100) unlabeled CaM, 0.2 mm Ca2+, 2 μmATP, and autophosphorylated CCaMK. This demonstrates that the increase in anisotropy is due to the specific interaction between CaM-D and autophosphorylated kinase. Filter binding experiments using biosynthetically labeled CaM (35S-CaM) suggested that CaM could distinguish between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the kinase (Fig. 3). We used an unhydrolyzable ATP analog (AMP-PNP) to study whether the increase in affinity for CaM is due to binding of ATP to the kinase active site or due to the consequent autophosphorylation of the kinase. Incubation of CCaMK with AMP-PNP (Fig. 2) did not show any significant changes in anisotropy values compared with those in the absence of ATP. Thus, the increased affinity could not be induced with the unhydrolyzable ATP analog. This suggests that an ATP-mediated modification (autophosphorylation) is absolutely necessary for increased affinity for CaM. This is a novel finding that autophosphorylation-dependent affinity for CaM could function as a molecular switch in regulating plant CCaMK. Deletion mutants of CCaMK were also used to test whether Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation is a prerequisite for the variable affinity for CaM and to study contributions of C-terminal visinin-like domain. The three deletion mutants were used to carry out fluorescence anisotropy measurements (Fig.4, A–C). Interestingly none of the three EF-hand deletion mutants showed any increase in affinity for CaM-D in the presence of 0.2 mm Ca2+ and 2 μm ATP (Table II). However, these mutants showed a Ca2+-dependent interaction with CaM-D (Fig. 4,A–C) evident from the increase in anisotropy in the presence of 0.2 mm Ca2+, suggesting a functional CaM-binding site. The increase in anisotropy was not observed when the mutant kinases were added to the assay mixture containing 2.5 mm EGTA. The increase in anisotropy obtained in the presence of Ca2+ could be reversed by adding 2.5 mm EGTA (data not shown). These mutants also did not show any Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation (Fig. 1). This suggests that autophosphorylation of CCaMK mediated by the visinin-like domain is a prerequisite for increased affinity for CaM by CCaMK. Our results provide the first biochemical mechanism for CaM regulation of a plant protein kinase. Nonphosphorylated CCaMK has low affinity (Kd = 55.3 nm), whereas autophosphorylated form of CCaMK has significantly increased affinity for CaM (Kd = 6.5 nm) (Fig. 2, TableII). The autophosphorylation-dependent increase in affinity for CaM acts as a switch for maximal kinase activity. The state of high affinity for CaM due to Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation could be physiologically significant in plants. This mechanism may help to maintain kinase activity when the free CaM concentration is limiting. This condition could result from Ca2+concentrations that do not saturate CaM or from CaM concentrations that are locally lower than the concentration of CaM-binding sites (12Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation-dependent affinity changes for CaM is a new mechanism of signal transduction in plants. It is necessary to explore the properties of the Ca2+ messenger system in detail to understand how Ca2+ regulates diverse cellular processes. The ability to transmit information by Ca2+ messenger system is greatly enhanced through the use of amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) (16Berridge M.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 759-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 17Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 157-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the mammalian Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase, CaMK II, can decode the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations (12Meyer T. Hanson P.I. Stryer Schulman H. Science. 1992; 256: 1199-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 18Konick P.D. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar and 19Putney Jr., J.W. Science. 1998; 279: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It may be possible that the visinin-like domain can mediate some kind of signal modulation (FM or AM) regulating the kinase activity in the target tissues. CCaMK is highly tissue-specific, developmentally regulated, and found to be expressed in dividing cells like pollen mother cells in anther where it is expressed during the onset of meiosis through the tetrad stage (8Poovaiah B.W. Xia M. Liu Z. Wang W. Yang T. Sathyanarayanan P.V. Franceschi V.R. Planta. 1999; 209: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Here we describe a new mechanism of regulation of a chimeric kinase by Ca2+ and Ca2+/CaM previously not known to operate for protein kinases from plants or animals or microbial systems. In animals visinin-like Ca2+ sensing proteins and Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases are encoded by two different genes, whereas in plants it appears that these two gene products exist as a chimeric kinase. We have compared the Ca2+ binding properties of the E. coli expressed visinin-like domain protein of CCaMK to CaM. Our results have revealed that the visinin-like domain protein binds Ca2+ at nanomolar range where as CaM binds at micromolar range. 3W. Wang and B. W. Poovaiah, unpublished results. A possible mechanism of CCaMK activation that arises from consideration of this paper and previously published work from our laboratory can be summarized as follows (Fig. 5). In the ground state the kinase is autoinhibited and inactive. The first event in the kinase cycle could be the perception of Ca2+ signals by the neural visinin-like domain at the C-terminal (could serve as a molecular antenna for the kinase domain). In the presence of ATP, Ca2+ binding to the visinin-like domain results in autophosphorylation of the kinase, and an increased affinity for CaM. Ca2+/CaM binding to the CaM-binding domain displaces the autoinhibitory region interacting with kinase domain and releases autoinhibition (14Ramachandiran S. Takezawa D. Wang W. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), thus stimulating the kinase activity. At this stage the CCaMK is maximally active. In the case of CaMK II, the autophosphorylation and release of autoinhibition are reported to occur by Ca2+/CaM binding to the CaM binding region (20Colbran R.J. Fong Y.L. Schworer C.M.

Unlike CCaMK, for Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation, CaM is absolutely required by CaMK II (15Colbran R.J. Schworer C.M. Hashimoto Y. Fong Y.L. Rich D.P. Smith M.K. Soderling T.R. Biochem.

In the case of CCaMK these are two separate processes, autophosphorylation mediated by visinin-like domain and release of autoinhibition mediated by Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 5). Previous reports from this laboratory (9Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) indicated that incubation of 1 μm CaM in the autophosphorylation assay mixture decreased autophosphorylation. This suggests that CaM binding may reduce access to the autophosphorylation sites. Our results suggest that autophosphorylation and CaM binding are two separate steps in the activation of CCaMK, one leading to the other. Autophosphorylation regulated variable affinity for CaM mediated by the neural visinin-like domain of plant CCaMK could be a mechanism of transducing Ca2+/CaM signals into precise phosphorylation signals. Elucidating the precise molecular nature of the information transfer leading to the autophosphorylation of CCaMK and variable CaM affinity should provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of the Ca2+/CaM-mediated signal transduction in plants.

https://openalex.org/W2001515987,"Barnacles produce a cement that is a proteinaceous underwater adhesive for their secure attachment to the substratum. The biochemical properties of the cement have not previously been elucidated, because the insolubility of the cement proteins hampers their purification and characterization. We developed a non-hydrolytic method to render soluble most of the cement components, thereby allowing the proteins to be analyzed. Megabalanus rosa cement could be almost completely rendered soluble by its reduction with 0.5 m dithiothreitol at 60 degrees C in a 7 m guanidine hydrochloride solution, the high concentration of dithiothreitol being indispensable to achieve this. The effectiveness of this reduction treatment was confirmed by the detachment of the barnacle from the substratum. Three proteins comprising up to 94% of the whole cement were identified as the major cement components. The cDNA clone of one of these major proteins was isolated, and the site-specific expression of the gene in the basal portion of the adult barnacle, where the cement glands are located, was demonstrated. A sequence analysis revealed this cement component to be a novel protein of 993 amino acid residues, including a signal peptide. This is the first report of the major component of the barnacle cement protein complex."

The Ras family of small GTP-binding proteins plays an essential role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Distributing signals to downstream effector pathways, mainly those mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),1phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Ral-GDS (1Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Ras GTPases cycle between an inactive, GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state, and it is known that this mechanism is controlled by at least two types of regulatory proteins directly acting on Ras: GAPs (GTPase-Activating Proteins), potentiators of the capacity of Ras to hydrolyze GTP, and GEFs (Guanine nucleotide ExchangeFactors) that catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP, thus promoting its activation (2Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Ras-GRF/Cdc25mn is a GEF for the Ras family of small GTP-binding proteins cloned by virtue of its homology with theSaccharomyces cerevisiae CDC25 gene product that stimulates nucleotide exchange on S. cerevisiae RAS (3Martegani E.

In mammalians, Ras-GRF is expressed at high levels in brain (3Martegani E. Vanoni M. Zippel R. Coccetti P. Brambilla R. Ferrari C. Sturani E. Alberghina L.

Font de Mora J. Santos E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1097-1107PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Ras-GRF primary structure reveals the presence of a number of functional motifs presumably involved in diverse signaling control mechanisms and protein-protein interactions. As such, the carboxyl-terminal Cdc25 domain has strong homology with S. cerevisiae CDC25, thus its name, and it has been shown to catalyze nucleotide exchange on Ras. This domain is also present in other GEFs for the Ras family (8Feig L.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In its amino terminus, Ras-GRF contains a Dbl homology domain (DH) (9Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossmann K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) that bears strong resemblance to the oncoprotein Dbl, a GEF for the GTPase Cdc42 (10Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The DH domain is generally present in GEFs for the Rho family of small G proteins (11Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar) and other proteins such as Ect2 (12Miki T. Smith C.L. Long J.E. Eva A. Fleming T.P. Nature. 1993; 362: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) of yet unidentified function but also believed to be involved in the regulation of the Rho family GTPases. In Ras-GRF, the DH domain is flanked by two Pleckstrin homology domains (PH) also present in Rho family GEFs and other unrelated proteins. Although suggested to bind phospholipids and play a role in membrane targeting, the function of the PH domain remains largely unknown (13Lemmon M.A. Fergusson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). With regards to the biological role of Ras-GRF and the mechanisms governing it, it has been shown that Ras-GRF is capable of inducing cellular transformation in fibroblast (14Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Zhang K. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7718-7724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Ras-GRF is also involved in conveying signals from G protein-coupled receptors to Ras (15Marttingly R.R. Macara I.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 16Shou C. Wurmser A. Ling K. Barbacid M. Feig L.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1887-1893PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zippel R. Orecchia S. Sturani E. Martegani E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2697-2703PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium can also regulate Ras-GRF activity by a mechanism mediated through a calmodulin-binding motif (IQ domain) present in its amino terminus (18Cheney R.E. Mooseker M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (suppl.): 21aGoogle Scholar, 19Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Gosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). As such, calcium ionophores like ionomycin can enhance Ras-GRF-mediated activation of the MAPK pathway (19Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Gosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 20Buchsbaum R. Telliez J. Gooneskera S. Feig L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutations within the DH domain inhibit ionomycin-induced MAPK activation (21Freshney N.W. Gooneskera S.D. Feig L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Ras-GRF DH domain may somehow function in the regulation of this signaling route. In this study we have investigated the role of Ras-GRF DH domain in the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway. We present evidence that Ras-GRF requires its DH domain to translocate to the membrane and, in so doing, become activated. We also demonstrate that, in an unprecedented fashion, this process is regulated by the GTPase Cdc42 that when GDP-bound precludes Ras-GRF recruitment to the membrane and the subsequent activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Ras-GRF mutants: ΔPH1 (bp 74–460 deleted), ΔDH (bp 578–1519), ΔPH2 (bp 1417–1993), and ΔCdc25 (bp 1993–3790) were obtained by standard restriction enzyme digestions and polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis. Sequences of the oligonucleotides used and the mutation strategies followed are available upon request. All constructs were in the pCEV mammalian expression vector background (22Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were regularly grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Subconfluent cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran technique (22Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 3–4 μg per plate with vector DNA when necessary. NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum DNA and transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (23Wigler M.S. Silverstein L.S. Lee S. Pellicer A. Cheng Y. Axel R. Cell. 1977; 11: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). After 10–15 days in culture plates, the cells were stained in 5% Giemsa, and transformed foci were scored. MAPK and JNK kinase activities were determined as described previously (24Ajenjo N. Aaronson D.S. Ceballos E. Richard C. León J. Crespo P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7189-7197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in anti-HA immunoprecipitates using myelin basic protein (Sigma) or GST-ATF2 as substrates for MAPK or JNK, respectively, and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 5× Laemmli buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. The gels were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Total lysates were fractionated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cappel). Mouse monoclonal anti-AU5 antibody was from Babco. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-Ras-GRF and anti-Cdc42 were from Santa Cruz Laboratories. Anti-FLAG antibody was from Eastman Kodak. In vivo nucleotide exchange was determined in COS-7 cells cotransfected with AU5-tagged GTPases and the different activating constructs as described (25Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 26Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured for 48 h, serum-starved in phosphate-free DMEM for 18 h, labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) for 2–6 h and disrupted in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-AU5 antibody for 1 h, and immunocomplexes were recovered using protein G-Sepharose beads, washed once in lysis buffer, washed twice in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, and resuspended in 1 mKH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Bound nucleotides were released by heating and fractionated using polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography plates. This was performed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, buffer, basically as described previously (21Freshney N.W. Gooneskera S.D. Feig L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Bacterially synthesized GST-fusion proteins were purified using standard procedures. 20 μg were incubated with lysates from cells transfected with Ras-GRF, basically as described previously (27Byrne J.L. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2055-2065PubMed Google Scholar). AU5 Cdc42-transfected cells were lysed in: 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 10 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 4% glycerol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin. GTP-bound AU5 Cdc42 was affinity-sequestered with bacterially synthesized GST-PAK Rac/Cdc42 binding domain (RBD) (70–106 amino acids) basically as described (28Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were performed as described above using anti-AU5 antibody. To investigate the role of Ras-GRF DH domain in the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, we utilized transient overexpression as an experimental approach, because most of the available data on Ras-GRF biochemistry has been obtained by this method. To begin with, we generated a series of expression plasmids encoding for deletion mutants of the different domains present in Ras-GRF, and their expression in COS-7 cells was ascertained by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 A,top panel). Because the anti-GRF antibody utilized (Santa Cruz) recognizes a carboxyl terminus epitope absent in the Cdc25 deletion mutant (ΔCdc25), we tagged this mutant with an amino-terminal FLAG epitope to enable its detection (Fig.1 A, right panel). We first assayed the ability of the deletion mutants to catalyze GDP/GTP exchange on Ras. For this purpose, the different Ras-GRF constructs were cotransfected into COS-7 cells together with an AU5-tagged H-Ras (26Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), cells were incubated with [P32]orthophosphate, and nucleotide exchange was scored in anti-AU5 immunoprecipitates after thin-layer chromatography (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 1 A(lower panel), deletion of the PH1 and PH2 domains (ΔPH1, ΔPH2) had no effect on the capacity of Ras-GRF to induce GDP/GTP exchange on Ras, but the disruption of the DH domain (ΔDH) decreased Ras-GRF exchange activity to an extent similar to that caused by deleting the catalytic Cdc25 domain (ΔCdc25). Consequently, we then determined how the different deletions affected Ras-GRF-induced MAPK activation, by cotransfecting the mutants with an HA epitope-tagged form of ERK2 (29Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). In full agreement with the data above, we found that there were no significant differences on the activation of MAPK elicited by the wild type, ΔPH1, and ΔPH2 mutants. On the other hand, MAPK activation was severely diminished on those cells transfected with the DH domain deletion mutant (Fig.1 B). It would be conceivable that the observed inactivity of the ΔDH mutant could be due to the deletion of the DH domain resulting in a misfolded, nonfunctional protein. To rule out this possibility, we assayed the activation of MAPK by another Ras-GRF mutant (DH−) in which the conserved LTLHELL motif within the DH domain had been substituted (21Freshney N.W. Gooneskera S.D. Feig L.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and where no misfolding should be expected. We found that DH− was also impaired in its ability to activate MAPK (Fig.1 C). Moreover, both the ΔDH and DH− mutants could interact in vitro with H-Ras as efficiently as did the wild type protein (Fig. 1 D). This ruled out a misfolded protein incapable of interacting with Ras as the reason for the inability of the ΔDH mutant to stimulate the Ras/MAPK pathway. The fact that Ras-GRF has been shown to transform murine fibroblasts (14Cen H. Papageorge A.G. Vass W.C. Zhang K. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7718-7724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Khosravi-Far R. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Solski P.A. Eva A. Burridge K. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6848-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate how the removal of the DH domain would affect the Ras-GRF ability to induce focus formation. To do so, we utilized the standard focus-formation assay in NIH 3T3 murine fibroblasts (23Wigler M.S. Silverstein L.S. Lee S. Pellicer A. Cheng Y. Axel R. Cell. 1977; 11: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). The colonies arising after transfection of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with Ras-GRF showed a typical “Ras” phenotype (Fig.2 and data not shown). Nevertheless, Ras-GRF transforming potential, as ascertained by the number of foci generated upon transfection, was 20-fold less than that exhibited by Ras V12. Deletion of the PH1 domain did not alter focus-formation induced by Ras-GRF. Surprisingly, ΔPH2 which, as shown above, exhibited an unaltered capacity for inducing Ras GDP/GTP exchange and MAPK stimulation, was entirely inhibited in its focus-forming activity. On the other hand, the absence of the DH domain completely abolished Ras-GRF-induced transformation, just as much as deleting the catalytic Cdc25 domain (Fig. 2). Overall, these results indicate that the DH domain is essential for Ras-GRF activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway and subsequent biological activity. Because deletion of Ras-GRF DH domain had dramatic consequences on the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway and because the DH domain is a common structural feature of proteins that interact with Rho family G proteins (10Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar), we next explored whether the participation of a Rho family GTPase would be necessary for Ras activation induced by Ras-GRF. As an approach, we utilized the Rho family dominant inhibitory mutants analogous to Ras N17 (31Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). It was found that Cdc42 N17 caused a 60% reduction on Ras-GRF-induced GDP/GTP exchange over Ras, almost as much as Ras N17 (Fig. 3 A). But Rac and Rho dominant inhibitory mutants, otherwise capable of blocking JNK activation in COS-7 and 293T cells respectively (22Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 32Teramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar and data not shown), were ineffective. As an additional control, none of these inhibitory mutants affected MAPK stimulation by an activated MEK mutant (MEK E) known to act downstream of Ras (33Crews C.M. Alessandrini M.A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 257: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 B). These results suggested that Cdc42 could be participating in the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway by Ras-GRF. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect exerted by Cdc42 dominant interfering mutant was specific for Ras-GRF, because it did not affect the activation of MAPK by another Ras exchange factor such as SOS (Fig.3 C) under the same experimental setting. The above results suggested that there could exist a functional relationship between Cdc42 and Ras-GRF. This led us to investigate the existence of a direct interaction between Ras-GRF and Cdc42. In vitroexperiments have revealed that Ras-GRF cannot stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange in Rho family proteins, including Cdc42 (4Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To confirm if this was the case in vivo, we tested whether Ras-GRF could promote nucleotide exchange on Cdc42 in COS-7 cells, by scoring 32P-labeled GDP bound to the GTPases as a method to evaluate radiolabeled nucleotide incorporation rates (25Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E. Science. 1996; 271: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 26Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). We found that Ras-GRF readily induced GDP/GTP exchange on cotransfected AU5-Ras but failed to catalyze GTP uptake on AU5 Cdc42, whereas under the same experimental setting Dbl (10Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar), a bona fide Cdc42 exchange factor, potently stimulated Cdc42 exchange activity (Fig.4 A, top panel). Thus, verifying in vivo that Ras-GRF is not an exchange factor for Cdc42. This result was further substantiated, as Cdc42 is a potent activator of Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) in COS-7 cells (22Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). However, Ras-GRF was unable to induce any JNK activation, whereas under the same experimental conditions, two exchange factors known to act on Cdc42, Dbl or Ost (34Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), markedly stimulated JNK (Fig.4 A, lower panel). Also, we could not detect any physical association in vitro between Ras-GRF and Cdc42, when nucleotide-free glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions of the Rho family GTPases were incubated with Ras-GRF-transfected COS-7 cell lysates. However, Ras-GRF specifically associated with GST-Ras under the same setting (Fig. 4 B). In a similar fashion, GDP and GTPγS-loaded Cdc42 did not interact with Ras-GRF either (data not shown). These results demonstrate that there is no direct functional, nor physical, relationship between Ras-GRF and Cdc42. It has been previously demonstrated that the amino-terminal region of Ras exchange factors is critical for determining their membrane localization (27Byrne J.L. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2055-2065PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chen R.H. Corbalan-Garcia S. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, we then examined how the deletion of the DH domain affected the subcellular localization of Ras-GRF. As shown in Fig.5 A, in transfected COS-7 cells Ras-GRF was evenly distributed between the cytosolic and particulate fractions. However, Ras-GRF ΔDH was almost completely absent from the membranous fraction. Strikingly, whereas Rac N17 and Rho N19 inhibitory mutants did not affect Ras-GRF cellular distribution, cotransfecting Cdc42 N17 together with Ras-GRF mimicked the effect of deleting the DH domain, by preventing the presence of Ras-GRF in the particulate fraction. Wild type Cdc42, which similar to Cdc42 N17 is preferentially GDP-bound under serum starvation conditions utilized in this assay (36Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), also diminished Ras-GRF recruitment to the particulate fraction. On the other hand, a constitutively active, GTP-bound, Cdc42 QL (22Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar) did not alter Ras-GRF distribution (Fig. 5 A). The cellular distribution of Ras-GRF under these circumstances was further substantiated with the aid of enhanced green fluorescent protein chimeras in which the Cdc25 domains of wild type and ΔDH Ras-GRF were substituted by enhanced green fluorescent protein, generating proteins clearly visible under the microscope. By this method we could verify the above-mentioned results: the presence in the membrane of Ras-GRF wt and its disappearance from this structure upon cotransfection with Cdc42 N17, resembling the distribution of the ΔDH mutant present solely in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Interestingly, the effects of the different Cdc42 proteins on Ras-GRF localization in the particulate fraction, matched their influence over the Ras-GRF-induced activation of MAPK: Cdc42 N17 caused a 60% reduction, Cdc42 wild type diminished it by 30%, and MAPK activation was unaffected by Cdc42 QL (Fig. 5 B). These effects could not be attributed to their expression levels, because they were similarly expressed (inset in Fig. 5 B). The inhibitory effect of Cdc42 wild type was dose-dependent, because increasing the amount of cotransfected Cdc42 wild type gradually decreased Ras-GRF-induced MAPK activation, concomitantly with the disappearance of Ras-GRF from the particulate fraction and its accumulation in the cytoplasm (data not shown). These results suggested that the DH domain might be required for positioning Ras-GRF in the particulate fraction and, in so doing, bringing about the activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway. As such, we reasoned that targeting inactive Ras-GRF ΔDH to the membrane might restore its ability to activate MAPK. To ascertain this point, we engineered a membrane-bound Ras-GRF ΔDH by the addition of an H-Ras CAAX box (37Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) (ΔDH CAAX). It was found that this protein, verified to be preferentially located in the membrane fraction, was capable of potently activating MAPK (Fig. 5 C). Thereby, this proved that the DH domain is involved in Ras-GRF recruitment to the membrane, a requirement for activating MAPK. In the same line, we hypothesized that, if Cdc42 N17 would be inhibiting Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation by precluding its recruitment to the particulate fraction, a membrane-targeted Ras-GRF should be insensible to Cdc42 N17 restraint. As reasoned, we found that activation of MAPK by the membrane-bound Ras-GRF CAAX, mainly located in the particulate fraction, was unaffected by Cdc42 N17 (Fig. 5 D). Therefore, this supports the notion that Cdc42 has a role in directing Ras-GRF to the membrane. The experiments described above demonstrated that Cdc42 wild type and N17, but not QL, blocked MAPK activation by Ras-GRF. This implied that Cdc42 would be acting as a blocker in the GDP-bound but not in the GTP-bound state. If this were to be the case, induction of GDP/GTP exchange on Cdc42 should facilitate Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation. To ascertain this hypothesis, we cotransfected the Rho family GEFs Dbl and Vav with suboptimal concentrations of Ras-GRF, not enough to yield MAPK per se. High concentrations of Cdc42 wt were also cotransfected in order to make more remarkable any effect exerted by the exchange factors. As shown in Fig. 6 A, Dbl markedly potentiated Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation, whereas Vav, a Rac-1-specific exchange factor (26Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), was largely ineffective. On the other hand, JNK activation by the exchange factors was unaffected by the presence of Ras-GRF (Fig. 6 A). This result suggested that decreasing the amount of GDP-bound Cdc42 promoted MAPK stimulation by Ras-GRF. The calcium ionophore ionomycin has been shown to greatly potentiate Ras-GRF activity (19Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Gosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 524-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that GDP-bound Cdc42 inhibits the activation of Ras-GRF. Therefore, to stimulate Ras-GRF, ionomycin would be expected to alleviate the Cdc42-mediated restraint by diminishing the levels of GDP-Cdc42, something that could be accomplished by the induction of GDP/GTP exchange over Cdc42. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the ionomycin-induced generation of GTP-bound Cdc42 by specifically capturing it with the aid of a GST-PAK Rac/Cdc42 binding domain (RBD) fusion (28Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (634) Google Scholar). For this purpose, COS-7 cells transfected with AU5-Cdc42 were stimulated with ionomycin for 1 min, and this treatment induced the formation of GTP-Cdc42 to the same extent as in those cells transfected with the Cdc42 exchange factor Dbl (Fig. 6 B). Moreover, the Cdc42 N17 dominant interfering mutant could markedly diminish Ras-GRF-mediated MAPK activation induced by ionomycin in a specific fashion, because Rac and Rho inhibitory mutants failed to affect it (Fig. 6 C). This proves that the stimulatory effect of ionomycin over Ras-GRF activity is dependent on Cdc42. In this study we have investigated the role of the DH domain in Ras-GRF biochemical and biological functions. Using a set of deletion mutants for the different domains harbored in the Ras-GRF regulatory domain, we show that the amino-terminal PH1 domain is dispensable for the sti"

We have characterized apoptosis induced by the nuclear death domain-containing protein p84N5. Adenovirus-mediated N5 gene transfer or transfection of p84N5 expression vectors induces apoptosis in tumor cell lines with nearly 100% efficiency as indicated by cellular morphology, DNA fragmentation, and annexin V staining. Using peptide substrates and Western blotting, we have determined that N5-induced apoptosis is initially accompanied by activation of caspase-6. Activation of caspases-3 and -9 does not peak until 3 days after the peak of caspase-6 activity. Expression of p84N5 also leads to activation of NF-κB as indicated by nuclear translocation of p65RelA and transcriptional activation of a NF-κB-dependent reporter promoter. Changes in the relative expression level of Bcl-2family proteins, including Bak and Bcl-Xs, are also observed during p84N5-induced apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrate that p84N5-induced apoptosis does not require p53 and is not inhibited by p53 coexpression.

Programmed cell death (PCD)1 is essential for normal development, tissue homeostasis, and host defense mechanisms. PCD is recognized by a collection of distinctive morphological and biochemical characteristics termed apoptosis (1Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar). An intrinsic genetic program that is conserved through evolution controls PCD in mammals (2Ellis R.E. Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). For example, the ced-3 gene that is required for PCD inCaenorhabditis elegans encodes a protein that is a functional homologue of the family of mammalian cysteine proteases termed caspases (3Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). Activation of these caspases by proteolytic processing is required for the execution of apoptosis. Members of the mammalian Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulatory proteins also have a homologue in C. elegans, the ced-9gene (4Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Some members of this family, like Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, inhibit apoptosis, whereas others like Bax, Bak, or Bcl-Xs promote apoptosis (5Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar). The pathways leading to apoptosis in response to extracellular stimuli, like tumor necrosis factor, or in response to mitochondrial apoptotic signals, such as cytochrome c release, are well characterized (6Yuan J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 7Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Initiator caspases are typically recruited to protein complexes composed of death receptors and/or adapter molecules. These proteins contain signature protein interaction motifs like the death domain, the death effector domain, or the CARD domain. The locally high concentration of recruited caspase proenzyme presumably leads to proteolytic processing to more active forms, thereby triggering a caspase proteolytic cascade. Apoptotic signals can also originate from within the nucleus. For example, DNA damage caused by radiation triggers a stress response that can result in apoptotic cell death (8Haimovitz-Friedman A. Radiat. Res. 1998; 150: S102-S108Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The mechanisms utilized by nuclear apoptotic signals to initiate caspase proteolytic cascades are not well understood. A number of nuclear transcription factors can induce apoptosis, including p53. Although p53 has a well-documented role in the cell's response to DNA damage, the mechanism used by p53 to initiate apoptosis is controversial. Although it is presumed to trigger apoptosis from within the nucleus by altering the expression of genes more directly involved in the execution of apoptosis, non-nuclear mechanisms unrelated to transcriptional regulation have also been proposed (12Bennett M. Macdonald K. Chan S.W. Luzio J.P. Simari R. Weissberg P. Science. 1998; 282: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Few proteins other than transcription factors have been documented to initiate apoptosis from within the nucleus. Nuclear localization of expanded polyglutamine repeat proteins is required for their ability to induce apoptosis that causes progressive neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease or spinocerebellar ataxia (9Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 10Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H. Hersch S.M. Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Cell. 1998; 95: 41-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-8 is a required step in this process (11Sanchez I. Xu C.J. Juo P. Kakizaka A. Blenis J. Yuan J. Neuron. 1999; 22: 623-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-8 apparently occurs by a novel mechanism involving recruitment of the proenzyme to characteristic protein aggregates that are associated with these diseases. Recently, we demonstrated that the nuclear protein encoded by the N5 gene (p84N5) was capable of initiating apoptosis (13Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Evans R. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The N5 gene was originally isolated based on the ability of p84N5 to bind an amino-terminal domain of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) (14Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Association of p84N5 with pRb inhibits p84N5-induced apoptosis, identifying p84N5 as a potential mediator of pRb's inhibitory effects on apoptosis (15Wang J.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because p84N5 is unique among nuclear proteins in containing a death domain that is required for its ability to induce apoptosis (13Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Evans R. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it may participate directly in a nuclear apoptotic pathway. In the current study, we characterize this pathway by analyzing caspase activation, Bcl-2 family member expression, the effects of p53, and NF-κB activation during p84N5-induced apoptosis. SAOS-2, 293, MCF-7, and C-33A cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin), in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Growth curves with these cell lines were assayed by plating 500,000 cells per well of a 60-mm tissue culture dish, treating with indicated virus at an multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10, harvesting cells by trypsinization at the indicated time after infection, and counting the number of cells that exclude trypan blue with a hemacytometer. The Colo357 X cell line was obtained from Dr. Keping Xie (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center) and was grown as above. Growth assays of virally infected Colo357 X cells were performed by plating at a density of 20,000 cells/well in 24-well plates in triplicate. One day later, the cells were infected with the indicated adenoviruses at a total m.o.i. for all viruses of 50. An equal number of cells were treated with PBS as a control. Cells were harvested at different time intervals and viable cells, as indicated by trypan blue exclusion, were counted using a hemacytometer. The full-length p84N5 cDNA was subcloned into pCEP4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) expression vector to create the expression vector pCMVN5. The Bcl-2 (16Herrmann J.L. Beham A.W. Sarkiss M. Chiao P.J.

Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) were described previously. To generate the recombinant p84N5 expressing adenovirus, the p84N5 cDNA was subcloned into the pAdCMV (AS)-BGHpa vector (Dr. T. J. Liu, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center). The resulting plasmid, was coelectroporated with pJM17, the adenovirus backbone plasmid, into 293 cells and recombinant N5 adenovirus (AdN5) identified by polymerase chain reaction using primers specific for N5 essentially as described (21Zhang W.-W. Fang X. Branch C.D. Mazur W. French B.A. Roth J.A. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 868-872PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus was purified by CsCl equilibrium density gradient centrifugation, and viral particle numbers were estimated by A 260 in the presence of SDS as described (22Huyghe B.G. Liu X. Sutjipto S. Sugarman B.J. Horn M.T. Shepard H.M. Scandella C.J. Shabram P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1403-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Infectious titer was determined by an end point assay using an adenovirus direct immunofluorescence kit (Chemicon International, Inc.). The GFP- and p53-expressing adenoviruses were gifts of Dr. T. J. Liu and were prepared as above. For transfections, cells were seeded on 100-mm dishes and transfected the following day by calcium phosphate precipitation (23Wigler M. Sweet R. Sim G.K. Wold B. Pellicer A. Lacy E. Maniatis T. Silverstein S. Axel R. Cell. 1979; 16: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar) using 6–30 μg of total DNA. To analyze transfected or infected cells for DNA fragmentation, cells were collected 24 h after treatment and free DNA ends were stained with terminal deoxytransferase (TUNEL) using the APO-DIRECT kit (Phenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA) according to manufacture's instructions. Annexin V staining was assayed 2 days following infection by harvesting cells by trypsinization, washing with PBS, and staining with annexin V Alexa 568 following the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). FACS analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur instrument (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Hoechst 33342 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) staining was performed by adding the dye at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml to the culture media. Cells were incubated with the dye for 10 min and immediately photographed at 100× magnification under a fluorescence microscope with a UV filter. To assay activation of caspase activity, cells were infected by addition of AdGFP or AdN5 to the culture media. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for the desired length of time and then collected, washed twice with PBS, and extracted, and the extracts were analyzed for caspase activity using colorimetric peptide substrates as directed by the manufacturer (BioVision, Palo Alto, CA). For analysis of luciferase reporter gene activity, transfected cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed, and aliquots of the lysate corresponding to 5 × 104successfully transfected cells were assayed for luciferase activity using reagents from the Analytical Luminescence Laboratory (Ann Arbor, MI). The pEGFP-C1 vector was included in the transfections to determine the transfection efficiency. Cells were examined for GFP by fluorescence microscopy prior to extraction. For Western analysis, transfected cells were extracted in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin on ice for 10 min. The total protein concentration of the soluble extract was determined by Bradford assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 70 μg of total protein for each sample was resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted, and stained as described previously (13Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Evans R. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Antibodies directed against p84N5 (14Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and pRb (24Connell-Crowley L. Harper J.W. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) were described previously. All other primary antibodies were used as directed by the manufacturer. Antibodies directed against caspases were obtained from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA); all other antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Primary antibodies were detected using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The full-length, wild type N5 cDNA was used to generate a recombinant, E1-deleted, replication-defective adenovirus (AdN5) that expressed wild-type p84N5 under control of the cytomegalovirus early promoter and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal. This adenovirus was used to drive expression of p84N5 in infected cells. The proliferation of cells infected with AdN5 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 slowed significantly by the third day after infection (Fig.1 A). Nearly all AdN5-infected cells died by 6 days after infection. The proliferation of cells infected with a similarly constructed GFP-expressing recombinant adenovirus (AdGFP) was similar to uninfected cells. Both AdGFP-infected and untreated cells reached confluency by day 4, explaining the decrease in proliferation rate observed at the later stages of the experiment. To test whether the observed decrease in cell viability of AdN5-infected cells was due to apoptosis, cells were assayed for the presence of fragmented DNA by TUNEL 3 days after infection. Nearly 80% of cells infected with AdN5 contained fragmented DNA (Fig.1 B). Infection with AdGFP did not alter the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells relative to uninfected cells. Consistent with this observation, AdN5-infected cells also demonstrated an increase in phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane as determined by annexin V staining (Fig. 1 C). Finally, AdN5-infected cells exhibited an increased permeability to Hoechst 33342 and condensed chromatin (Fig. 1 D). AdGFP-infected cells did not show increases in annexin V or Hoechst 33342 staining. To ensure that apoptosis induced by AdN5 coincided with increased expression of p84N5, protein extracts prepared from infected cells were analyzed by Western blotting using a mouse anti-N5 monoclonal antibody. 24 h after infection, the level of p84N5 expression had increased in AdN5-treated cells at least 5-fold relative to AdGFP-treated cells (Fig. 1 E). The efficiency of adenoviral-mediated gene transduction under the conditions used in these experiments was 98% as determined by fluorescent microscopy of AdGFP-infected cells. To identify the caspases activated during N5-induced apoptosis, extracts prepared from infected cells have been assayed for caspase activity using seven different colorimetric peptide substrates. Extracts prepared 48 h after infection contain significant VEID peptide cleavage activity (Fig.2 A). VEID is an efficient substrate for caspase-6 (25Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the level AdN5-induced DEVD cleavage activity does not increase above background until 4 days after infection, and the relative extent of activation is lower than VEID cleavage activity. DEVD is an efficient substrate for caspases-3 and -7. A small increase in LEHD cleavage activity is also observed 4–5 days after infection. LEHD is an efficient substrate for caspase-9. Increases in cleavage activity of the other peptides tested, which include efficient substrates for capases-1, -2, -4, -5, and -8, were not detected upon AdN5 infection. AdGFP-infected cell extracts did not contain cleavage activity above background for any of the peptides tested. 2J. Doostzadeh-Cizeron, unpublished observation. To confirm that caspase-6 was involved in the increase in VEID cleavage activity upon AdN5 infection, extracts were analyzed for proteolytic processing of caspases-6 and -9 by Western blotting. Proteolytically processed caspase-6 was detected in extracts prepared 2 or 3 days after infection with AdN5, but not in extracts prepared from AdGFP-infected cells (Fig. 2 B). Processing of caspase-9 was also detected in extracts prepared 4 days after infection. These observations indicated that the activation of VEID cleavage activity detected was likely due, at least in part, to activation of caspase-6. Activation of NF-κB serves as a survival signal in response to varied apoptotic stimuli, including genotoxic agents like ionizing radiation (26Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-kB involves translocation of the protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor to regulate the expression of target genes. To examine possible activation of NF-κB by p84N5, nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts prepared from 293 cells transfected with pCMVN5 or empty vector have been analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-p65RelA monoclonal antibody. In comparison to cells transfected with empty vector, the level of p65RelA in the cytoplasm of pCMVN5-transfected cells decreases while the relative level of p65RelA in the nucleus increases (Fig. 3 A). To test whether the nuclear translocation of p65RelA coincides with increased transcriptional activity, a luciferase reporter gene driven by an artificial NF-κB-responsive promoter was cotransfected with pCMVN5 or empty vector, and the levels of luciferase activity in the extracts of transfected cells were assayed. Expression of p84N5 potently increases luciferase activity generated from the NF-κB-responsive promoter construct but not from a reporter construct containing a mutant promoter that is insensitive to NF-κB (Fig.3 B). The level of reporter gene induction by p84N5 expression was similar to that achieved by expression of exogenous p65RelA. Bcl-2 and its homologues are critical regulators of cell death. Changes in the expression of either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic family members can facilitate apoptosis. We have examined the expression of Bak, Bax, Bad, Bcl-Xs, and Bcl-2 during p84N5-induced apoptosis by Western blot analysis. Transfection of pCMVN5 into 293 cells or SAOS-2 cells causes detectable apoptosis within 48 h (13Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Evans R. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An increase in relative protein expression of Bak and Bcl-Xs was detected in similarly transfected 293 cells relative to cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 4 A). No change in the relative level of expression of Bad, Bax, or Bcl-2 was detected in N5-transfected cells. Nor were their changes in MAD protein expression. Bak and Bcl-Xs are apoptotic agonists that heterodimerize withBcl-2 and inhibit its ability to protect cells from cell death (27Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T.

Nature. 1995; 374: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The increase in expression of these genes may facilitate p84N5-induced apoptosis. If true, a compensating increase inBcl-2 expression would be predicted to inhibit p84N5-induced apoptosis. To test this possibility, we have coexpressedBcl-2 with p84N5 and measured the effect on apoptosis using the TUNEL assay. More than 90% of transfected cells expressing p84N5 alone contain fragmented DNA. Coexpression of Bcl-2 with p84N5 decreases the percentage of cells containing fragmented DNA to near background levels (Fig. 4 B). We have demonstrated that expression of p84N5 in p53 null SAOS-2 cells (30Chandar N. Billig B. McMaster J. Novak J. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) induces apoptosis (Fig. 1 A), indicating that p53 was not required for p84N5-induced apoptosis. We wished to explore the possibility that p53 may inhibit p84N5-induced apoptosis. To this aim, p84N5 and wild-type p53 were expressed in SAOS-2 cells and the cells assayed for apoptosis by TUNEL. Coexpression of wild-type p53 did not affect the percentage of cells containing fragmented DNA (Fig.5 A). Consistent with our previous results (13Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Evans R. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), expression of a constitutively active pRb mutant (RbΔCDK) decreased the percentage of cells containing fragmented DNA. Expression of p53 and RbΔCDK upon transfection of the appropriate expression vectors was confirmed by Western blotting.2 We also compared the effects of pCMVN5 transfection in wild-type p53 expressing MCF-7 cells or SAOS-2 cells. MCF-7 and SAOS-2 cells were equally sensitive to p84N5-induced apoptosis as indicated by the similar percentage of transfected cells containing fragmented DNA (Fig.5 B). MCF-7 and SAOS-2 cells were also equally sensitive to apoptosis induced by AdN5 (32Yin, S., Hung, M.-C., and Goodrich, D. W. (2000) Cancer Gene Ther., in press 32Google Scholar). Finally, we checked the effect of p84N5 expression on the relative level of endogenous p53, p110Rb, p16, or p27 expression by Western blotting. The expression level of each of these proteins was similar in CMVN5-transfected cells and cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 5 C). These observations suggested that N5 and p53 function in different apoptotic pathways. If true, the effects of each gene on the inhibition of cell growth would be expected to be at least additive. To test this prediction, the effect of AdN5 infection, Adp53 infection, or a combination of both on the growth of Colo357 X cells was determined. These cells are relatively resistant to the effects of AdN5, 3S. Yin, unpublished observation. allowing any increase in the effect of infection on cell growth to be determined. Both AdN5 infection and Adp53 infection decreased the growth rate of these cells. Treatment with either virus caused the number of cells to decrease by day 6. The kinetics of cell accumulation upon AdN5 or Adp53 infection appeared similar; AdN5 had a slightly greater effect on cell growth than did Adp53. Interestingly, infection with a combination of both viruses had an even greater effect on cell growth (Fig.6). The number of cells infected with AdN5 and Adp53 at any one time were typically 2- to 4-fold less than the number of cells infected with either AdN5 or Adp53 alone. This difference is likely an underestimate, because the m.o.i. of each virus in the combination infection is half that of the m.o.i. in the single infections. Our data indicate that forced expression of p84N5, either by transfection or adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, renders cells inviable. Loss of viability is due to induction of apoptotic cell death, because p84N5-expressing cells exhibit many of the typical characteristics of this process, including fragmentation of DNA, exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, changes in membrane permeability, and changes in cellular and nuclear morphology. The p84N5 protein has significant sequence similarity to the death domains of other proteins involved in apoptosis (31Feinstein E. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and characteristic point mutations known to inactivate other death domain proteins also compromise p84N5-induced cell death (13Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Evans R. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p84N5 is unique among death domain-containing proteins in its nuclear localization (14Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and nuclear localization is required for p84N5-induced cell death. 4R. Evans and D. W. Goodrich, unpublished observation. There is a relatively small number of proteins that are known to initiate apoptosis from within the nucleus, including the expanded polyglutamine repeat proteins and possibly transcription factors like p53. To test whether the apoptotic pathway triggered by p84N5 expression is similar to that triggered by these other nuclear proteins, we have examined the activation of NF-κB, changes in Bcl-2 family protein expression, the effects of p53, and caspase activation during p84N5-induced apoptosis. NF-κB activation during p84N5-induced apoptosis is indicated by the change in localization of p65RelA from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in AdN5-infected cells but not in AdGFP-infected cells. The change in subcellular localization is accompanied by an increase in NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation as determined by increased levels of a luciferase reporter gene whose transcription is dependent on NF-κB transactivation. In contrast to p84N5, expression of p53 inhibits NF-κB activation (33Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3485-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wadgaonkar R. Phelps K.M. Haque Z. Williams A.J. Silverman E.S. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1879-1882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB is observed during apoptosis initiated by DNA-damaging agents like ionizing radiation (35Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 36Singh S.P. Lavin M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5279-5285Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), among others (37Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 38Legrand-Poels S. Bours V. Piret B. Pflaum M. Epe B. Rentier B. Piette J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6925-6934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although similar mechanisms may be utilized to activate NF-κB, p84N5-induced apoptosis is unlikely to be mediated by NF-κB-mediated Fas ligand expression, and CD95 ligation as has been proposed for some DNA-damaging agents (37Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Fas-mediated apoptosis requires activation of caspase-8 and is CrmA-sensitive, whereas p84N5-induced apoptosis does not require caspase-8 activation and is insensitive to Crm A (see below). Our results also demonstrate that apoptosis induced by p84N5 is accompanied by an increase in the relative expression of pro-apoptoticBcl-2 family members Bak and Bcl-Xs. The expression ofBcl-2, Bax, and Bad are unchanged during p84N5-induced apoptosis. In contrast, p53-induced apoptosis involves an increase in the relative expression of Bax (39Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Alteration in the levels ofBcl-2 family protein expression can change mitochondrial membrane permeability allowing release of cytochrome c. Cytoplasmic cytochrome c participates in a protein complex composed of caspase-9 and Apaf-1 that leads to caspase activation (40Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). For example, Bak can accelerate release of cytochromec through mitochondrial porin channels (41Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Bak can also disrupt association of Apaf-1 and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2family protein Boo (42Song Q. Kuang Y. Dixit V.M. Vincenz C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hence, p84N5-induced apoptosis may be facilitated by the increase in Bak expression observed. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that coexpression of Bcl-2can inhibit p84N5-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, like p84N5-induced apoptosis, apoptosis induced by forced expression of Bak is insensitive to CrmA (43Orth K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8841-8844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, because p84N5-induced apoptosis is initiated by caspase-6 activation rather than caspase-9, Bak either facilitates apoptosis by a different mechanism or it participates in the later execution stages of the process. Whether p84N5 can directly influence transcription is unknown. However, NF-κB can regulate the transcription of some Bcl-2 family genes (44Lee H.H. Dadgostar H. Cheng Q. Shu J. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 45Tsukahara T. Kannagi M. Ohashi T. Kato H. Arai M. Nunez G. Iwanaga Y. Yamamoto N. Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Fujii M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7981-7987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so the effect of p84N5 on the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins may be indirect. Our data indicate that p84N5-induced apoptosis does not require p53. Cells with wild-type p53 (MCF-7) or null for p53 (SAOS-2) are equally sensitive to p84N5-induced cell death. Furthermore, we show that p84N5-induced apoptosis does not alter the level of p53 expression and that coexpression of p53 does not inhibit p84N5-induced apoptosis. For a number of reasons we believe it likely that N5 and p53 function in different apoptotic pathways. As described above, p53 and p84N5 have different effects on NF-κB activation and Bcl-2 family protein expression. Furthermore, p53-induced apoptosis is dependent on caspase-3 and/or caspase-9 in many cases (46Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J.G. Craig C.G. Robertson G.S. Nicholson D.W. Park D.S. Slack R.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7860-7869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Soengas M.S. Alarcon R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 48Yu Y. Little J.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). These caspases are not required for p84N5-induced apoptosis. Finally, we show that infection with both AdN5 and Adp53 causes a more dramatic reduction of Colo357 X cell growth than infection with either one alone. Genes that participate in or activate the same apoptotic pathway would not be expected to have such an additive or synergistic effect. Consistent with our hypothesis that N5 and p53 function in different pathways, N5-induced apoptosis is preceded by a G2/M cell cycle arrest while expression of p53 typically induces a G1 cell cycle arrest.2 The pattern of caspase activation during p84N5-induced apoptosis is atypical. Caspase-6 is the first caspase activated, and it makes up the majority of caspase activity observed in extracts of AdN5-infected cells. This conclusion is based upon cleavage of a peptide substrate, VEID, that is preferred by caspase-6 as well as by detection of proteolytically processed caspase-6. The pattern of caspase activation is unlikely to be influenced by adenoviral infection, because caspases are not activated in AdGFP-infected cells. Because activation of caspase-6 precedes or is coincident with DNA fragmentation, annexin V staining, and loss of cell viability, we conclude that it may mediate p84N5-induced apoptosis. Activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity is also detected in AdN5-infected cells. However, activation of these caspases is unlikely to mediate p84N5-induced apoptosis. First, activation of caspase-9 or -3 occurs after execution of apoptosis has already begun. The activation of a caspase-3, for example, is not detected until 4 days after infection, well after the time when DNA fragmentation can be detected. This observation suggests activation of caspases-9 and -3 is a consequence of earlier caspase-6 activation. Second, MCF-7 cells, which lack caspase-3 (49Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), are sensitive to AdN5. Hence, caspase-3 is not required for p84N5-induced apoptosis. This pattern of caspase activation suggests that p84N5 triggers an apoptotic pathway distinct from those triggered by expanded polyglutamine repeat proteins or death domain-containing receptors. Apoptosis induced by these proteins require caspases-3, -8, or -9, whereas p84N5-induced apoptosis involves caspase-6. Short prodomain caspases are presumed responsible for the execution phase of apoptosis and typically rely on long prodomain caspases for initial proteolytic activation. Caspase-6 is a short prodomain caspase yet is activated before activation of any other caspase, including long prodomain caspases-8 or -9, during p84N5-induced apoptosis. The activation of caspase-6 is not likely to depend on caspase-9, because caspase-6 is a poor substrate for caspase-9 in vitro (50Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Caspase-8 is also unlikely to be involved, because an efficient caspase-8 peptide substrate is not cleaved by extracts of AdN5-treated cells and because p84N5-induced apoptosis is insensitive to CrmA (13Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Evans R. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a potent inhibitor of caspase-8. Finally, caspase-3 is unlikely to be involved, because it is not required for p84N5-induced apoptosis. Caspase-6 is either activated by a protease whose activity has not been detected in our experiments or is activated by a novel mechanism during p84N5-induced apoptosis. By analogy to other death domain-containing proteins, p84N5 may play an important part in caspase-6 activation. In this study, we have characterized the apoptotic pathway triggered by the expression of the nuclear death domain-containing p84N5. Our data indicate that p84N5-induced apoptosis is characterized by activation of caspase-6, increases in the expression of Bcl-2pro-apoptotic family members Bak and Bcl-Xs, and activation of NF-kB. Furthermore, this pathway does not require p53, nor does the presence of p53 affect the efficiency of cell killing. Expression of Rb, however, does inhibit p84N5-induced apoptosis, presumably mediated by physical association between the two proteins (13Doostzadeh-Cizeron J. Evans R. Yin S. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3251-3261Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These observations, coupled with the fact that p84N5 is a death domain-containing protein localized within the nucleus, suggest that p84N5 participates in an apoptotic pathway that is different from those triggered by p53, death domain-containing receptors, or expanded polyglutamine repeat proteins.

In this report, crystal structures have been solved for the apoenzyme, binary complexes of the enzyme with reduced cofactor or 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA substrate, and an abortive ternary complex of the enzyme with NAD(+) and acetoacetyl-CoA. The models illustrate positioning of cofactor and substrate within the active site of the enzyme. Comparison of these structures with the previous model of the enzyme-NAD(+) complex reveals that although significant shifting of the NAD(+)-binding domain relative to the C-terminal domain occurs in the ternary and substrate-bound complexes, there are few differences between the apoenzyme and cofactor-bound complexes. Analysis of these models clarifies the role of key amino acids implicated in catalysis and highlights additional critical residues. Furthermore, a novel charge transfer complex has been identified in the course of abortive ternary complex formation, and its characterization provides additional insight into aspects of the catalytic mechanism of l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase."

The tail domains have been subdivided by sequence into three regions: a basic domain (TH-1),1 a Gly/Pro/Ala-rich (GPA) domain (TH-2), and a Src homology 3 domain (TH-3).

As we will discuss later (see “Discussion”), the TH-3 domain is likely to be involved in the localization of myosin Is and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (18Barylko B. Binns D.D. Albanesi J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The three Acanthamoeba myosin Is have similar catalytic activities. All have high ATPase activity in the presence of EDTA and either NH4+ or K+ and low activity in the presence of Mg2+ that is substantially activated by F-actin, a diagnostic characteristic of the myosin superfamily. However, the MgATPase activity of these amoeba myosin Is has an unusual triphasic dependence on the F-actin concentration (17Albanesi J.P. Coué M. Fujisaki H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13276-13280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Brzeska H. Lynch T.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 427-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lynch T.J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 19333-19339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),i.e. substantial activation at low F-actin concentrations peaking at about 2 μm, followed by a decrease in the activity and then normal hyperbolic activation that begins to plateau at about 80 μm F-actin. A variety of experimental data and computer modeling strongly support the conclusion that this triphasic actin dependence is caused by cooperative cross-linking of actin filaments by myosin I at high ratios of myosin I to actin (17Albanesi J.P. Coué M. Fujisaki H. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13276-13280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Brzeska H. Lynch T.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol.

The ability of these myosins to cross-link actin filaments can be explained by the presence of two actin-binding sites, the ATP-sensitive actin-binding site in the catalytic domain that is common to all myosins of all classes and the ATP-insensitive actin-binding site(s) in the tail that occurs in some (but not all) class I myosins including, in addition to the three Acanthamoeba myosin Is, two of the five Dictyostelium myosin Is (23Lee S.F.

Like other Paks, the 97-kDa MIHCK is activated by Rac and Cdc42 (34Brzeska H. Young R. Knaus U. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and lipids (35Brzeska H. Lynch T.J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3591-3594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only the 35-kDa C-terminal catalytic domain and a short p21-binding domain near the N terminus of MIHCK have sequence similarity to other Paks (34Brzeska H. Young R. Knaus U. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the central region of MIHCK is very rich in Pro residues, including multiple PXXP repeats characteristic of SH3-binding domains in other proteins (34Brzeska H. Young R. Knaus U. Korn E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seemed possible that the TH-3 (SH3) tail subdomain of theAcanthamoeba myosin Is might be a site for interaction with MIHCK. From this brief introduction, it is apparent that the three tail subdomains have important roles in the activity and function of theAcanthamoeba myosin Is. However, the properties of the tail domains have been characterized mostly by studying the properties of bacterially expressed peptides. In the work described in this paper, we compared the properties of expressed wild type Acanthamoebamyosin IC and truncated and deletion tail mutants to define more quantitatively the actin-binding region in the tail, to confirm that the triphasic actin dependence of the MgATPase activity is caused by the second actin-binding site in the tail, and to evaluate the possibility that the SH3 domain of Acanthamoeba myosin IC may interact with the Pro-rich region of MIHCK. After these studies were completed, Lee et al. (5Lee W.-L. Ostap E.M. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35159-35171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reported interesting results, which we will discuss later in this paper, on the actin-binding properties of bacterially expressed peptides corresponding to the TH-1 and TH-2 plus TH-3 regions of Acanthamoeba myosin IA. Standard methods were used for all DNA manipulations (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kington R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). The myosin I heavy chain cDNA (accession number AF051353) cloned into pBluescript plasmid (3Jung G. Korn E.D. Hammer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6720-6724Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,6Wang Z.Y. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Korn E.D. Hammer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15200-15205Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) served as the template for the PCR reactions described below. Fig. 1shows the mutants constructed in this study. The plasmid containing the TH-3 deletion mutant (ΔSH3) was constructed utilizing a unique SanDI site located upstream of the SH3 domain of myosin IC and an XbaI site in the vector located downstream of the myosin IC stop codon. Two primers were synthesized for PCR. The sense primer (primer A), 5′-CGTCCTACGTCGAGGGTCCCCCGCGCGCCG-3′ (bp 3134 and 3163 of myosin IC heavy chain) introduced a new SanDI restriction site (underlined) immediately downstream of the SH3 domain. The antisense primer (primer B) was 5′-GCTCACATGTTCTTTCCTGCGTTATCCCCTGATTC-3′ (bp 1128–1162 of pBluescript II KS+ vector). The original myosin IC plasmid was digested withSanDI and XbaI, and the PCR product was cloned between these sites resulting in a deletion of 198 bp, which encode the amino acids between Pro-986 and Ile-1051 in the myosin IC heavy chain (bp 2956–3153). An intermediate vector with a unique MluI site immediately following the myosin IC stop codon was constructed to generate all the truncation mutants. The sense primer (primer C), 5′-GTCCTCCTCCCCCGGGTCCC TA ACGCGTCCGGACCAATGC-3′ (bp 3539–3579 of myosin IC), was designed to introduce aSanDI restriction site (first underlined sequence) upstream of the stop codon (in bold) and an MluI site (second underlined sequence) downstream of the stop codon. The PCR was run between sense primer C and antisense primer B, and the product was cloned into the original plasmid digested with SanDI andXbaI. This produced a vector containing myosin IC heavy chain cDNA truncated at the SanDI site with anMluI site downstream of the stop codon. The T-2, T-3, T-4, T-5, and T-6 truncants were generated by PCR utilizing a unique ScaI site located within the light chain-binding region of the myosin IC heavy chain and anMluI site of the intermediate vector. The sense primer (primer D), 5′-CCGCGTCGTGTGCCCCAAGACCTGGTCCG-3′ (bp 1881–1909) was used to generate all the truncants. The antisense primers for each truncation contained a stop codon (in bold) that was introduced immediately after the truncation point and an MluI restriction site (underlined) downstream of the stop codon. The antisense primers were: for T-2, 5′-CAGGCGACGACGCACGCGT TAGTTGACGAGCGCGTCATTG-3) (bp 2142–2181); for T-3, 5′-ACGCTGATCAGCACGCGT TAGTCCTGCAGCGGGCTGAGGG-3′ (bp 2471–2511); for T-4, 5′-GCCGCCGCCTCCCACGCGT AAGAGGATCTGGTCCTTGTAGG-3′ (bp 2977–3012); for T-5, 5′-GTCATACAGCGCACGCACGCGT AAGGGTCCGGGCGC-3′ (bp 3141–3169); for T-6, 5′-GCGCAGCGACGCGTTAGATGAGTTCGACG-3′ (bp 3149–3169). The wild type myosin IC plasmid was used as template. Each of the PCR products was subcloned into the intermediate vector digested withMluI and partially digested with ScaI (because the vector DNA has a second ScaI site). T-1 was constructed utilizing the PstI site located within the head domain of the myosin IC heavy chain and the MluI site in the T-2 plasmid. Primers used for PCR were: sense primer 5′-CAACTTCGTGAAGCTGCAGCAGATCTTC-3′ (bp 1234–1267 of myosin IC heavy chain), which contains a PstI site (underlined); antisense primer 5′-GGTCTTGCGGAGGAATCTCACGCGT TAGTTGGCGTAGGAGAAC-3′ (bp 2061–2103 of myosin IC), which introduced a new stop codon (in bold) after the truncation point and an MluI site (underlined) immediately downstream of the stop codon. The PCR product was subcloned into pBluescript T-2 digested completely withMluI and partially with PstI (because the vector contains another PstI site). This produced truncated DNA encoding T-1 (Fig. 1). The sequences of all the mutant DNAs were confirmed. The wild type and mutant heavy chain DNAs were subcloned from pBluescript into the expression vector PVL1393 (PharMingen) by digestion with BamHI. A Flag epitope tag, MADYKDDDDYA, was placed at the N terminus of all of the heavy chains to provide a means for rapid purification of the wild type and mutant myosins. Sf-9 cells were cultured in suspension using Grace's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfection was achieved by mixing 2–4 μg of plasmid DNA with 0.5 μg of BaculoGold vector DNA (PharMingen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Recombinant viruses were identified as occlusion-negative plaques. Viral stock was amplified according to the manufacturer's protocols and kept at 4 °C. The myosin IC light chain (6Wang Z.Y. Wang F.

Brzeska, unpublished data. viral stocks were prepared previously in this laboratory. Wild type and mutant myosins were produced by co-infection of Sf-9 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) with heavy chain and light chain viral stocks. All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Wild type and mutant myosins were purified as described previously (6Wang Z.Y. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Korn E.D. Hammer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15200-15205Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, Sf-9 cells were harvested 48 h after infection. About 2 g of cells were homogenized in 20 ml of extraction buffer (200 mm NaCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman T170 rotor for 1 h, and the resultant supernatant was added to 1 ml of packed anti-FLAG antibody resin (Sigma) that had been washed with 0.1 m glycine (pH 3.5) and equilibrated with the extraction buffer. The resin was washed with 20 ml of extraction buffer, and myosin was eluted with 2.5 ml of extraction buffer containing 0.15 mg/ml FLAG peptide. The eluted fraction was concentrated about 3-fold by dialysis against 50% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. After dialysis the sample was clarified by spinning at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the final product was kept in liquid nitrogen until use. The myosins were partially phosphorylated during expression in Sf-9 cells. To prepare unphosphorylated myosins for use as substrates for MIHCK, wild type myosin IC and the T-2 mutant were dephosphorylated while bound to the FLAG affinity resin as an added step in the purification procedure. The resin with bound myosin was washed with ∼20 volumes of extraction buffer and then with one volume of phosphatase buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). About 4000 units of lambda protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) in 1 ml of phosphatase buffer (New England Biolabs) was added to ∼1 ml of the resin-bound myosin. Dephosphorylation was carried out at room temperature for 15 min with occasional resuspension of the resin by pipetting. The resin was then washed with the extraction buffer, and myosin was eluted and collected as described above. For expression of maximum actin-dependent MgATPase activity, the myosins must be fully phosphorylated on Ser-329. The wild type and mutant myosins were incubated with activated (autophosphorylated) 35K catalytic domain of MIHCK at a molar ratio of 1 to 8 in buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm ATP, 3.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EGTA (and 50 mm NaCl and 25% glycerol derived from the myosin storage buffer) at 30 °C for 10 min. As determined by the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP, phosphorylation was complete (1 mol/mol). The 35K catalytic domain and full-length MIHCK were purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column as described (32Brzeska H. Szczepanowska J. Hoey J. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Che m. 1996; 271: 27056-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Purified kinase was dialyzed against 50% glycerol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT and kept in liquid nitrogen until use. The kinase and 35K catalytic domain were essentially homogeneous as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). To obtain fully active, autophosphorylated kinases, the purified 35K catalytic domain and full-length MIHCK (both at 0.2 mg/ml) were first incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 mm imidazole (pH 7.0) containing 2.5 mm ATP, 3.5 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm EGTA and BSA (0.2 mg/ml). Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder according to Spudich and Watt (37Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Acanthamoeba actin, which was kindly provided by Dr. Kirsten Remmert (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute), was prepared as described (38Gordon D.J. Yang Y.Z. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7474-7479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of myosins and kinases were determined by the Bradford method using BSA as the standard (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Actin concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 0.62 cm2/ml at 290 nm. Assays were performed essentially as described (40Szczepanowska J.R., U. Herring C.J. Gruschus J.M Qin J. Korn E.D. Brzeska H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4146-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The activated kinases (4.5 nm) were incubated at 30 °C for 20 s with various concentrations of dephosphorylated wild type and T-2 mutant myosins, as substrates, in 50 mmimidazole (pH 7.0) containing 2.5 mm[γ-32P]ATP (30,000 cpm/nmol), 3.5 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm EGTA and BSA (0.2 mg/ml). At all substrate concentrations, the rate of phosphorylation was linear with time for the period of incubation. The binding of wild type and mutantAcanthamoeba myosin IC to F-actin was assayed in solutions containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, with or without 2.5 mm ATP as indicated, and NaCl at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Myosins were mixed with various concentrations of F-actin and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TL centrifuge at 4 °C. The fraction of myosin unbound was determined by measuring the NH4/EDTA-ATPase activity remaining in the supernatant. Steady state ATPase activities were determined at 30 °C by measuring the radioactivity of Pireleased from [γ-32P]ATP as described (2Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures for the assay of MgATPase activity contained 20 mmimidazole, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm [γ-32P]ATP (120 cpm/nmol) with or without F-actin as indicated. The reaction mixtures for the assay of NH4/EDTA-ATPase activity contained 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 400 mmNH4Cl, 35 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 3 mm [γ-32P]ATP (120 cpm/nmol). The reactions were started by the addition of myosin at 30 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). The separating gel consisted of two layers; the upper half contained 7.5% acrylamide and the lower half contained 13% acrylamide. The 129-kDa heavy chain of myosin IC can be divided into a head domain, residues 1–693; a light chain-binding neck domain, residues 694–720; and four tail domains: the basic TH-1 domain, residues 721–940; the TH-3 (SH3) domain, residues 997–1051; and the two segments of the GPA TH-2 domain, GPA-1, residues 941–996, and GPA-2, residues 1052–1186, that are separated by the SH3 domain (Fig.1). As described under “Materials and Methods,” we constructed six truncated mutants and one deletion mutant (Fig. 1): T-1, the head only; T-2, the head and neck; T-3, the head, neck, and one-half of TH-1; T-4, the head, neck, and entire TH-1; T-5, the head, neck, TH-1, and GPA-1; T-6, the head, neck, GPA-1, and SH3; and ΔSH3, the entire heavy chain except for the deleted SH3 region. The wild type heavy chain and seven mutant heavy chain constructs were individually co-expressed with the light chain in Sf-9 cells. All of the heavy chains were expressed very well (see Fig.2, first lane, for expression of wild type heavy chain). All of the myosins were readily purified by the procedure described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 2), except for T-3, the mutant that was truncated within the TH-1 domain, which we were unable to solubilize and, therefore, could not study further. We compared the binding of the wild type and six mutant myosins to an excess of muscle F-actin in the presence or absence of ATP. As expected, because the head domain of all myosins has a high affinity, ATP-sensitive actin-binding site, all of the expressed myosins bound to actin essentially quantitatively in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3). The wild type and ΔSH3 myosins also bound to F-actin in the presence of ATP but T-1 and T-2 did not. T-4, T-5, and T-6 had intermediate behavior. Each bound extensively to F-actin in the presence of ATP but not as well as in the absence of ATP. These results are consistent with the recent report by Lee et al. (5Lee W.-L. Ostap E.M. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35159-35171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that bacterially expressed peptides corresponding to the TH-1, TH-2, and TH-2/3 domains ofAcanthamoeba myosin IA bind to F-actin in the presence of ATP. Next, we quantified the relative affinities for F-actin of wild type myosin and the T-4, T-5, T-6, and ΔSH3 mutants in the presence of ATP (Fig. 4). The measuredKd values were: wild type, 22 nm; ΔSH3, 35 nm;"
https://openalex.org/W2091535783,"Abstract We have identified a cell quiescence-specific 33-kDa cytoplasmic protein kinase (p33QIK,Quiescence-Induced Kinase) based on induction of p33QIK-specific kinase activity of cells growth-arrested in the quiescent phase and deactivation upon entry into the cell cycle. Blockage of macromolecular synthesis prevents p33QIK from deactivation, indicating a requirement of newly synthesized regulators for deactivation of p33QIK during G0/G1 transition. Stress shock induces additional increases of p33QIK activity in a quiescence-dependent manner that correlates with induction of apoptosis. Using a specific antibody to Krs1/Mst2 protein, we found that p33QIK is related to p63Krs1 and is distinguishable from a 36-kDa protein kinase, which is induced through proteolytic modification of activated p63Krs1 in proliferating cells undergoing apoptosis. p33QIK is constantly expressed in quiescent, proliferating, and apoptotic quiescent cells. Regulation of p33QIK activity involves protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in a proteolysis-independent manner. Regulation of p33QIK and related p63Krs1 and p36 appears to involve distinct pathways in quiescent and proliferating cells, respectively. Our results illustrate the relevance of p33QIK activity for cell quiescence that may provide a new insight into signaling pathways regulated in cells during quiescence and quiescence-related apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2086796756,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha) are mitogenic hormones that exert their activity primarily by binding to the EGF receptor, also known as ErbB-1. We have recently characterized a set of EGF/TGFalpha chimeric molecules with similar high affinity for ErbB-1 as EGF and TGFalpha and shown that three of these chimeras induce mitogenic cell stimulation at already a 10-fold lower concentration than their wild-type counterparts (Lenferink, A.

In the present study we show that these so-called superagonistic chimeras do not differ from EGF and TGFalpha in their ability to induce ErbB-1 tyrosine phosphorylation but are considerably more potent in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Direct cell binding studies and analysis of ligand-receptor interaction by surface plasmon resonance measurements revealed that both the association rate constant (k(on)) and the dissociation rate constant (k(off)) of these superagonists is 3-5-fold higher in comparison with the wild-type ligands and nonsuperagonistic chimeras. These data indicate that the dynamic on and off rate constants for receptor binding may be more specific parameters for determining the mitogenic activity of peptide hormones than their constants for equilibrium receptor binding."
