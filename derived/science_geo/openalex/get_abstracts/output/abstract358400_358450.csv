The main assumptions., some of which have already been discussed by other physicists, are given below. We use the nomenclature employed by the Bristol observers for the different categories of mesons observed in photographic plates."

https://openalex.org/W2034885921,"THE amphibious snail Lymnæa truncatula, which serves as an intermediate host of the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, has been found in the past to be somewhat difficult to maintain in laboratory culture. In connexion with current work on the epidemiology of the severe disease of grazing animals which is caused by this parasite, one of our first problems was to establish satisfactory means of culturing the snail. Our attempts have proved so far successful that we are able to grow the snails in unlimited numbers, at different seasons of the year and to a larger size than they usually attain in their natural habitat."

Obviously, such determinations may be useful also in evaluating the normal and abnormal functions of other physiologically related endocrine glands as well as of organs like the liver and kidneys. The clinical applications of these data are self-evident. 

Various attempts have been made to circumvent the notoriously inaccurate values which have been obtained for the urinary estrogens by a variety of bioassay methods and calorimetric techniques (1, 2). The acknowledged shortcomings of these methods have led us to investigate the application of ultraviolet absorption spectrophotometry to the quantitative determination of the urinary estrogens in an attempt to develop an objective physical method for their accurate determination. It is known that the infra-red portion of the spectrum yields more differentially characteristic curves, but those of the ultraviolet range are more readily obtainable, and consequently better adapted to clinical use. 

This communication is concerned with studies of the following aspects of the problem: (1) spectrophotometric identification and quantitative micro determination of crystalline estrogens; (2) detection by spectrophotometric assay of gross errors in current methods for extraction and partition of estrogens; (3) studies on the ultraviolet absorption of substances comprising the background material; (4) separation of the phenolic estrogens from the so called neutral steroid fraction; (5) separation of urinary estrogens from other urinary phenolic substances by steam distillation; (6) micro-Girard separation of estrone from estradiol; (7) an essentially new method for the extraction and partition of crystalline estrone, estradiol, and estriol, and their quantitative assay by ultraviolet spectrophotometry."

https://openalex.org/W1986012762,"PODOCARPIC acid occurs as crystalline ‘heart shakes' in the wood of Dacrydium cupressinum, a forest tree endemic to New Zealand. It has been shown to possess the structure I by the work of Sherwood and Short1 and Campbell and Todd2,3. The latter workers established that the 7-isopropyl derivative of podocarpic acid differs from 6-hydroxydehydroabietic acid only in the configuration of the methyl and carboxyl groups at C1. The carboxyl group in podocarpic acid is, in fact, much more highly hindered than that of other resin acids."

In addition, all pigeons, except control birds, received daily 0.25 mgm. œstradiol dipropionate (‘Ovocycline P' Ciba, intramuscularly). The radiophosphorus was prepared by irradiations of phosphorus with deuterons produced by the cyclotron of the Laboratoire de Chimie Nucleaire of Paris (Prof. F. Joliot-Curie)."

https://openalex.org/W1991707418,"A LARGE number of investigations have been carried out on the disintegration of light nuclei bombarded with α-particles. In several cases excitation curves have been obtained for the γ-Radiation as a function of the energy of the α-particles. (A review of earlier polonium α-particle bombardments of light elements, particularly those which may be of interest for a possible γ-radiation, has baen published by the present writer in Arkiv. Mat., Ast. Fysih, 35 A, No. 31 ; 1948). The results of different authors, however, are often inconsistent. For that reason I made use of an available polonium sample of about .40 mC. for observing the excitation functions of the γ-radiation from light elements bombarded with α-particles. The energy of the α-particles was varied by means of carbon dioxide."

https://openalex.org/W2020542569,"THE use of ‘activated' glycerol dichlorhydrin as a reagent for the colorimetric or absorptiometric estimation of vitamin A has been proposed by Sobel and Werbin1. As reported, the reaction appears attractive in view of the stability of the chromophor, which makes for ease of measurement. A disadvantage is the low activity of the reagent compared with chloroformie antimony trichloride (Carr–Price reaction) ; the E (1 per cent, 1 cm.) 550 mµ value per unit of vitamin A is only about 25 per cent of the corresponding E(1 per cent, 1 cm.) 620 mµ (Carr–Price) value. The pure compound does not react at all; ‘activation' is effected by distillation with 1–2 per cent antimony trichloride1; but no account of what causes ‘activation' has yet appeared."

Malaria, which claims anything from 300 to 800 million victims a year, with an annual death roll of 3 to 4 million, is the most prevalent of all human infectious diseases and the worst scourge with which we have to contend throughout all our tropical and sub-tropical Colonies. It is not only responsible directly for enormous damage to health but it so lowers vitality by its destruction of blood cells that other infections are enabled to create perhaps even greater destruction than the malaria itself."

https://openalex.org/W4253368375,"THE plea for a historical approach in teaching science which Dr. J. B. Conant advanced in his Terry Lectures at Yale University, which have now been published under the title ‘On Understanding Science""*, raises questions of interest to many besides those who are concerned with teaching itself. Dr. Conant is indeed urging the use of case-histories in teaching science, and illustrates his proposal by the specific example of seventeenth-century experiments on the ‘spring of the air' with barometers, air pumps and vacua to show the influence of new techniques, the evolution of new concepts from experiment, the difficulties of experimentation and the significance of the controlled experiment, and the development of science as an organised social activity. These points are further emphasized by a study of the discovery of the electric battery and of the chemical revolution which placed our knowledge of combustion on a sound basis, in which he shows further how an accidental discovery may lead by a series of well-planned experiments to a new technique or a new concept, or both. In exploring a new phenomenon, the experiments may be Well planned without any working hypothesis as to the nature of the phenomenon ; furthermore, a useful concept may even be a barrier to the acceptance of a better one if it be long entrenched in the minds of scientific men. Experimental discoveries, he believes, must fit the times ; facts may be at hand for years without their significance being realized ; the total scientific situation must be favourable for the acceptance of new views."
