https://openalex.org/W755741475,"Typical data in a microbiome study consist of the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts that have the characteristic of excess zeros, which are often ignored by investigators. In this paper, we compare the performance of different competing methods to model data with zero inflated features through extensive simulations and application to a microbiome study. These methods include standard parametric and non-parametric models, hurdle models, and zero inflated models. We examine varying degrees of zero inflation, with or without dispersion in the count component, as well as different magnitude and direction of the covariate effect on structural zeros and the count components. We focus on the assessment of type I error, power to detect the overall covariate effect, measures of model fit, and bias and effectiveness of parameter estimations. We also evaluate the abilities of model selection strategies using Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Vuong test to identify the correct model. The simulation studies show that hurdle and zero inflated models have well controlled type I errors, higher power, better goodness of fit measures, and are more accurate and efficient in the parameter estimation. Besides that, the hurdle models have similar goodness of fit and parameter estimation for the count component as their corresponding zero inflated models. However, the estimation and interpretation of the parameters for the zero components differs, and hurdle models are more stable when structural zeros are absent. We then discuss the model selection strategy for zero inflated data and implement it in a gut microbiome study of > 400 independent subjects."
https://openalex.org/W1494520636,"Integrin α11β1 is a stromal cell-specific receptor for fibrillar collagens and is overexpressed in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We have investigated its direct role in cancer progression by generating severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice deficient in integrin α11 (α11) expression. The growth of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells and two patient-derived non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) xenografts in these α11 knockout (α11(-/-)) mice was significantly impeded, as compared with wild-type (α11(+/+)) SCID mice. Orthotopic implantation of a spontaneously metastatic NCI-H460SM cell line into the lungs of α11(-/-) and α11(+/+) mice showed significant reduction in the metastatic potential of these cells in the α11(-/-) mice. We identified that collagen cross-linking is associated with stromal α11 expression, and the loss of tumor stromal α11 expression was correlated with decreased collagen reorganization and stiffness. This study shows the role of integrin α11β1, a receptor for fibrillar collagen in differentiation of fibroblasts into CAFs. Furthermore, our data support an important role for α11 signaling pathway in CAFs, promoting tumor growth and metastatic potential of NSCLC cells and being closely associated with collagen cross-linking and the organization and stiffness of fibrillar collagen matrices."
https://openalex.org/W1603781996,"The forkhead transcription factor FOXM1 has a key role in DNA damage response, and its deregulated overexpression is associated with genotoxic drug resistance in breast cancer. However, little is known about the posttranslational mechanisms by which FOXM1 expression is regulated by genotoxic agents and how they are deregulated in resistant cells. Initial co-immunoprecipitation studies verified previous proteomic analysis finding that the OTUB1 is a novel FOXM1-interacting protein. Western blot analysis showed that both OTUB1 and FOXM1 expression reduced upon genotoxic agent treatment in MCF-7 cells, but remained relatively constant in resistant cells. FOXM1 expression reduced upon OTUB1 depletion by siRNA and increased with OTUB1 overexpression in MCF-7 cells, arguing that OTUB1 positively regulates FOXM1 expression. In agreement, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that FOXM1 expression is associated with OTUB1 binding but inversely correlates with conjugation to the protein degradation-associated Lys-48-linked ubiquitin-chains. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) OTUB1, but not the OTUB1(C91S) mutant, disrupted the formation of Lys48-linked ubiquitin-conjugates on FOXM1. Importantly, knockdown of OTUB1 by siRNA resulted in an increase in turnover of FOXM1 in MCF-7 cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, whereas overexpression of WT OTUB1, but not the OTUB1(C91S) mutant, significantly enhances the half-life of FOXM1. In addition, proliferative and clonogenic assays also show that OTUB1 can enhance the proliferative rate and epirubicin resistance through targeting FOXM1, as OTUB1 has little effect on FOXM1-deficient cells. The physiological relevance of the regulation of FOXM1 by OTUB1 is further underscored by the significant correlations between FOXM1 and OTUB1 expression in breast cancer patient samples. Cox-regression survival analysis indicates that OTUB1 overexpression is linked to poorer outcome in particular in patients treated with chemotherapy. Collectively, these data suggest that OTUB1 limits the ubiquitination and degradation of FOXM1 in breast cancer and has a key role in genotoxic agent resistance."
https://openalex.org/W881622586,"Genome-wide association studies of inflammatory bowel diseases identified susceptible loci containing an autophagy-related gene. However, the role of autophagy in the colon, a major affected area in inflammatory bowel diseases, is not clear. Here, we show that colonic epithelial cell-specific autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) conditional knock-out (cKO) mice showed exacerbation of experimental colitis with more abundant bacterial invasion into the colonic epithelium. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that cKO mice had abnormal microflora with an increase of some genera. Consistently, expression of antimicrobial or antiparasitic peptides such as angiogenin-4, Relmβ, intelectin-1, and intelectin-2 as well as that of their inducer cytokines was significantly reduced in the cKO mice. Furthermore, secretion of colonic mucins that function as a mucosal barrier against bacterial invasion was also significantly diminished in cKO mice. Taken together, our results indicate that autophagy in colonic epithelial cells protects against colitis by the maintenance of normal gut microflora and secretion of mucus."
https://openalex.org/W1894201636,"Defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes, altered bioenergetics and metabolic shift are often seen in cancers. Here we show a role for the dysfunction of the electron transport chain component cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) in cancer progression. We show that genetic silencing of the CcO complex by shRNA expression and loss of CcO activity in multiple cell types from the mouse and human sources resulted in metabolic shift to glycolysis, loss of anchorage-dependent growth and acquired invasive phenotypes. Disruption of the CcO complex caused loss of transmembrane potential and induction of Ca2+/Calcineurin-mediated retrograde signaling. Propagation of this signaling includes activation of PI3-kinase, IGF1R and Akt, Ca2(+)-sensitive transcription factors and also TGFβ1, MMP16 and periostin, which are involved in oncogenic progression. Whole-genome expression analysis showed the upregulation of genes involved in cell signaling, extracellular matrix interactions, cell morphogenesis, cell motility and migration. The transcription profiles reveal extensive similarity to retrograde signaling initiated by partial mitochondrial DNA depletion, although distinct differences are observed in signaling induced by CcO dysfunction. The possible CcO dysfunction as a biomarker for cancer progression was supported by data showing that esophageal tumors from human patients show reduced CcO subunits IVi1 and Vb in regions that were previously shown to be the hypoxic core of the tumors. Our results show that mitochondrial electron transport chain defect initiates a retrograde signaling. These results suggest that a defect in the CcO complex can potentially induce tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W747889517,"Little information exists on coyote (Canis latrans) space use and habitat selection in the southeastern United States and most studies conducted in the Southeast have been carried out within small study areas (e.g., ≤1,000 km2). Therefore, studying the placement, size, and habitat composition of coyote home ranges over broad geographic areas could provide relevant insights regarding how coyote populations adjust to regionally varying ecological conditions. Despite an increasing number of studies of coyote ecology, few studies have assessed the role of transiency as a life-history strategy among coyotes. During 2009–2011, we used GPS radio-telemetry to study coyote space use and habitat selection on the Albemarle Peninsula of northeastern North Carolina. We quantified space use and 2nd- and 3rd-order habitat selection for resident and transient coyotes to describe space use patterns in a predominantly agricultural landscape. The upper limit of coyote home-range size was approximately 47 km2 and coyotes exhibiting shifting patterns of space use of areas >65 km2 were transients. Transients exhibited localized space use patterns for short durations prior to establishing home ranges, which we defined as “biding” areas. Resident and transient coyotes demonstrated similar habitat selection, notably selection of agricultural over forested habitats. However, transients exhibited stronger selection for roads than resident coyotes. Although transient coyotes are less likely to contribute reproductively to their population, transiency may be an important life history trait that facilitates metapopulation dynamics through dispersal and the eventual replacement of breeding residents lost to mortality."

https://openalex.org/W1540823275,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, which is mainly due to its high risk of metastatic dissemination. One critical point of this process is the ability of cancer cells to detach from the primary tumor and migrate through the extracellular matrix; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In the present study, we identified the small GTPase RhoB as a key regulator of bronchial cell morphology in a three-dimensional (3D) matrix. RhoB loss, which is frequently observed during lung cancer progression, induced an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterized by an increased proportion of invasive elongated cells in 3D. The process was mediated by Slug induction and E-cadherin repression. In addition, downregulation of RhoB induced Akt1 activation, which in turn activated Rac1 through the guanine-exchange factor Trio to control cell shape rearrangement. Further, we provide evidence that RhoB interacted with and positively regulates phosphatase PP2A through the recruitment of its regulatory subunit B55, which was found to be crucial for Akt dephosphorylation. B55 inhibition completely suppressed RhoB-mediated PP2A regulation. Finally, we show that PP2A inactivation, by targeting either its catalytic or its regulatory B55 subunit, completely reversed RhoB-dependent morphological changes and also fully prevented the ability of RhoB to decrease the invasiveness of bronchial cells. Altogether, these results highlight a novel signaling axis and describe new molecular mechanisms that could explain the tumor suppressor role of RhoB in lung cancer. Therefore, we propose that RhoB could be responsible for early metastatic prevention by inhibiting the EMT-derived invasiveness of lung cells through the control of PP2A activity."

https://openalex.org/W1527819984,"The atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF31 is highly expressed in human breast cancer, the most frequent neoplastic lethality among women. Here, RNF31 depletion in breast cancer cells in combination with global gene expression profiling revealed p53 (TP53) signaling as a potential RNF31 target. Interestingly, RNF31 decreased p53 stability, whereas depletion of RNF31 in breast cancer cells caused cell cycle arrest and cisplatin-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, RNF31 associated with the p53/MDM2 complex and facilitated p53 polyubiquitination and degradation by stabilizing MDM2, suggesting a molecular mechanism by which RNF31 regulates cell death. Analysis of publically available clinical data sets displayed a negative correlation between RNF31 and p53 target genes, including IGFBP3 and BTG1, consistent with RNF31 regulating p53 function in vivo as well. Together, our findings suggest RNF31 as a potential therapeutic target to restore p53 function in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2339318149,"The Nencki Affective Word List (NAWL) has recently been introduced as a standardized database of Polish words suitable for studying various aspects of language and emotions. Though the NAWL was originally based on the most commonly used dimensional approach, it is not the only way of studying emotions. Another framework is based on discrete emotional categories. Since the two perspectives are recognized as complementary, the aim of the present study was to supplement the NAWL database by the addition of categories corresponding to basic emotions. Thus, 2902 Polish words from the NAWL were presented to 265 subjects, who were instructed to rate them according to the intensity of each of the five basic emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear and disgust. The general characteristics of the present word database, as well as the relationships between the studied variables are shown to be consistent with typical patterns found in previous studies using similar databases for different languages. Here we present the Basic Emotions in the Nencki Affective Word List (NAWL BE) as a database of verbal material suitable for highly controlled experimental research. To make the NAWL more convenient to use, we introduce a comprehensive method of classifying stimuli to basic emotion categories. We discuss the advantages of our method in comparison to other methods of classification. Additionally, we provide an interactive online tool (http://exp.lobi.nencki.gov.pl/nawl-analysis) to help researchers browse and interactively generate classes of stimuli to meet their specific requirements."
https://openalex.org/W1536072591,"The process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in addition to being an initiating event for tumor metastasis, is implicated in conferring several clinically relevant properties to disseminating cancer cells. These include stem cell-like properties, resistance to targeted therapies and ability to evade immune surveillance. Enrichment analysis of gene expression changes during transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced EMT in lung cancer cells identified complement cascade as one of the significantly enriched pathway. Further analysis of the genes in the complement pathway revealed an increase in the expression of complement inhibitors and a decrease in the expression of proteins essential for complement activity. In this study, we tested whether EMT confers resistance to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) in lung cancer cells and promotes tumor progression. CD59 is a potent inhibitor of membrane attack complex that mediates complement-dependent cell lysis. We observed a significant increase in the CD59 expression on the surface of cells after TGF-β-induced EMT. Furthermore, CD59 knockdown restored susceptibility of cells undergoing EMT to cetuximab-mediated CDC. TGF-β-induced CD59 expression during EMT is dependent on Smad3 but not on Smad2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that Smad3 directly binds to the CD59 promoter. Stable knockdown of CD59 in A549 cells inhibited experimental metastasis. These results demonstrate that TGF-β-induced EMT and CD59 expression confers an immune-evasive mechanism to disseminating tumor cells facilitating tumor progression. Together, our data demonstrates that CD59 inhibition may serve as an adjuvant to enhance the efficacy of antibody-mediated therapies, as well as to inhibit metastasis in lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2165067326,"Ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced skin damage contributes strongly to the formation of melanoma, a highly lethal form of skin cancer. Quercetin (Qu), the most widely consumed dietary bioflavonoid and well known inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signalling, has been reported to be chemopreventive in several forms of non-melanoma skin cancers. Here, we report that the treatment of ultraviolet (UV)-B-irradiated B16F10 melanoma cells with quercetin resulted in a dose dependent reduction in cell viability and increased apoptosis. The present study has brought out that the pro-apoptotic effects of quercetin in UVB-irradiated B16F10 cells are mediated through the elevation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, calcium homeostasis imbalance, modulation of anti-oxidant defence response and depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨM). Promotion of UVB-induced cell death by quercetin was further revealed by cleavage of chromosomal DNA, caspase activation, poly (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and an increase in sub-G1 cells. Quercetin markedly attenuated MEK-ERK signalling, influenced PI3K/Akt pathway, and potentially enhanced the UVB-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation. Furthermore, combined UVB and quercetin treatment decreased the ratio of Bcl-2 to that of Bax, and upregulated the expression of Bim and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF). Overall, these results suggest the possibility of using quercetin in combination with UVB as a possible treatment option for melanoma in future."
https://openalex.org/W2162803038,"Previous studies reported that Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients treated with natalizumab for one or two years exhibit a significant reduction in relapse rate and in cognitive impairment, but the long term effects on cognitive performance are unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of natalizumab on cognitive impairment in a cohort of 24 consecutive patients with relapsing remitting MS treated for 3 years. The neuropsychological tests, as well as relapse number and EDSS, were assessed at baseline and yearly for three years. The impact on cortical atrophy was also considered in a subgroup of them, and are thus to be considered as preliminary. Results showed a significant reduction in the number of impaired neuropsychological tests after three years, a significant decrease in annualized relapse rate at each time points compared to baseline and a stable EDSS. In the neuropsychological assessment, a significant improvement in memory, attention and executive function test scores was detected. Preliminary MRI data show that, while GM volume did not change at 3 years, a significantly greater parahippocampal and prefrontal gray matter density was noticed, the former correlating with neuropsychological improvement in a memory test. This study showed that therapy with Natalizumab is helpful in improving cognitive performance, and is likely to have a protective role on grey matter, over a three years follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W856819346,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a vital component of signaling pathways involving PI3K/AKT, is an attractive therapeutic target in breast cancer. Everolimus, an allosteric mTOR inhibitor that inhibits the mTOR functional complex mTORC1, is approved for treatment of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. Other mTOR inhibitors show interesting differences in target specificities: BEZ235 and GSK2126458 are ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors targeting both PI3K and mTORC1/2; AZD8055, AZD2014 and KU-0063794 are ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors targeting both mTORC1 and mTORC2; and GDC-0941 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor. We have addressed the question of whether mTOR inhibitors may be more effective in combination than singly in inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells. We selected a panel of 30 human breast cancer cell lines that included ER and PR positive, HER2 over-expressing, and ""triple negative"" variants, and determined whether signaling pathway utilization was related to drug-induced inhibition of proliferation. A significant correlation (p = 0.005) was found between everolimus IC50 values and p70S6K phosphorylation, but not with AKT or ERK phosphorylation, consistent with the mTOR pathway being a principal target. We then carried out combination studies with four everolimus resistant triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, and found an unexpectedly high degree of synergy between everolimus and the other inhibitors tested. The level of potentiation of everolimus inhibitory activity (measured by IC50 values) was found to be cell line-specific for all the kinase inhibitors tested. The results suggest that judicious combination of mTOR inhibitors with different modes of action could have beneficial effects in the treatment of breast cancer."

As such, there has been great interest in studying its mode of action, which remains unknown.

An improved purification protocol enabled us to obtain active full-length CDNF and to determine its three-dimensional structure in solution. CDNF contains two well folded domains (residues 10–100 and 111–157) that are linked by a loop of intermediate flexibility. We identified two surface patches on the N-terminal domain that were characterized by increased conformational dynamics that should allow them to embrace active sites. One of these patches is formed by residues Ser-33, Leu-34, Ala-66, Lys-68, Ile-69, Leu-70, Ser-71, and Glu-72.

https://openalex.org/W2147639568,"Zebrafish fin regeneration involves initial formation of the wound epidermis and the blastema, followed by tissue morphogenesis. The mechanisms coordinating differentiation of distinct tissues of the regenerate are poorly understood. Here, we applied pharmacologic and transgenic approaches to address the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling during fin restoration. To map the BMP transcriptional activity, we analyzed the expression of the evolutionarily conserved direct phospho-Smad1 target gene, id1, and its homologs id2a and id3. This analysis revealed the BMP activity in the distal blastema, wound epidermis, osteoblasts, and blood vessels of the regenerate. Blocking the BMP function with a selective chemical inhibitor of BMP type I receptors, DMH1, suppressed id1 and id3 expression and arrested regeneration after blastema formation. We identified several previously uncharacterized functions of BMP during fin regeneration. Specifically, BMP signaling is required for remodeling of plexus into structured blood vessels in the rapidly growing regenerate. It organizes the wound epithelium by triggering wnt5b expression and promoting Collagen XIV-A deposition into the basement membrane. BMP represents the first known signaling that induces actinotrichia formation in the regenerate. Our data reveal a multifaceted role of BMP for coordinated morphogenesis of distinct tissues during regeneration of a complex vertebrate appendage."
https://openalex.org/W1897938007,"The ETS transcription factor ERG has been implicated as a major regulator of both normal and aberrant hematopoiesis. In acute myeloid leukemias harboring t(16;21), ERG function is deregulated due to a fusion with FUS/TLS resulting in the expression of a FUS-ERG oncofusion protein. How this oncofusion protein deregulates the normal ERG transcription program is unclear. Here, we show that FUS-ERG acts in the context of a heptad of proteins (ERG, FLI1, GATA2, LYL1, LMO2, RUNX1 and TAL1) central to proper expression of genes involved in maintaining a stem cell hematopoietic phenotype. Moreover, in t(16;21) FUS-ERG co-occupies genomic regions bound by the nuclear receptor heterodimer RXR:RARA inhibiting target gene expression and interfering with hematopoietic differentiation. All-trans retinoic acid treatment of t(16;21) cells as well as FUS-ERG knockdown alleviate the myeloid-differentiation block. Together, the results suggest that FUS-ERG acts as a transcriptional repressor of the retinoic acid signaling pathway."

An RNAi-silencing trigger can induce H3K27Me2 deposits at both episomal and chromosomal loci, mediating gene silencing. Our data support two phases of RNAi-mediated TGS: an active silencing phase where the RNAi trigger is present and both H3K27Me2 and Ago2-2 concurrently enrich at chromosomal loci; and an established silencing phase in which the RNAi trigger is removed, but gene silencing with H3K27Me2 enrichment persist independently of Ago2-2 deposition.

https://openalex.org/W1511099714,"Chemotherapy resistance is the major reason for the failure of ovarian cancer treatment. One mechanism behind chemo-resistance involves the upregulation of multidrug resistance (MDR) genes (ABC transporters) that effectively transport (efflux) drugs out of the tumor cells. As a common symptom in stage III/IV ovarian cancer patients, ascites is associated with cancer progression. However, whether ascites drives multidrug resistance in ovarian cancer cells awaits elucidation. Here, we demonstrate that when cultured with ascites derived from ovarian cancer-bearing mice, a murine ovarian cancer cell line became less sensitive to paclitaxel, a first line chemotherapeutic agent for ovarian cancer patients. Moreover, incubation of murine ovarian cancer cells in vitro with ascites drives efflux function in these cells. Functional studies show ascites-driven efflux is suppressible by specific inhibitors of either of two ABC transporters [Multidrug Related Protein (MRP1); Breast Cancer Related Protein (BCRP)]. To demonstrate relevance of our findings to ovarian cancer patients, we studied relative efflux in human ovarian cancer cells obtained from either patient ascites or from primary tumor. Immortalized cell lines developed from human ascites show increased susceptibility to efflux inhibitors (MRP1, BCRP) compared to a cell line derived from a primary ovarian cancer, suggesting an association between ascites and efflux function in human ovarian cancer. Efflux in ascites-derived human ovarian cancer cells is associated with increased expression of ABC transporters compared to that in primary tumor-derived human ovarian cancer cells. Collectively, our findings identify a novel activity for ascites in promoting ovarian cancer multidrug resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2293423585,"E-learning is a candidate tool for clinical practice guidelines (CPG) implementation due to its versatility, universal access and low costs. We aimed to assess the impact of a five-module e-learning course about CPG for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) on physicians' knowledge and clinical practice.This work was conceived as a pre/post single-arm intervention study. Physicians from 11 European countries registered for the online course. Personal data, pre- and post-course questionnaires and clinical data about 3 to 5 children with AGE managed by each physician before and after the course were collected. Primary outcome measures included the proportion of participants fully adherent to CPG and number of patients managed with full adherence.Among the 149 physicians who signed up for the e-learning course, 59 took the course and reported on their case management of 519 children <5 years of age who were referred to their practice because of AGE (281 and 264 children seen before and after the course, respectively). The course improved knowledge scores (pre-course 8.6 ± 2.7 versus post-course 12.8 ± 2.1, P < 0.001), average adherence (from 87.0 ± 7.7% to 90.6 ± 7.1%, P = 0.001) and the number of patients managed in full adherence with the guidelines (from 33.6 ± 31.7% to 43.9 ± 36.1%, P = 0.037).E-learning is effective in increasing knowledge and improving clinical practice in paediatric AGE and is an effective tool for implementing clinical practice guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2126940689,"Islet antigen (IA)-2, IA-2β, and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65) are major autoantigens in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Autoantibodies to these autoantigens appear years before disease onset and are widely used as predictive markers. Little is known, however, about what regulates the expression of these autoantigens. The present experiments were initiated to test the hypothesis that microRNAs (miRNAs) can target and affect the levels of these autoantigens. Bioinformatics was used to identify miRNAs predicted to target the mRNAs coding IA-2, IA-2β, and GAD65. RNA interference for the miRNA processing enzyme Dicer1 and individual miRNA mimics and inhibitors were used to confirm the effect in mouse islets and MIN6 cells. We show that the imprinted 14q32 miRNA cluster contains 56 miRNAs, 32 of which are predicted to target the mRNAs of T1D autoantigens and 12 of which are glucose-sensitive. Using miRNA mimics and inhibitors, we confirmed that at least 7 of these miRNAs modulate the mRNA levels of the T1D autoantigens. Dicer1 knockdown significantly reduced the mRNA levels of all 3 autoantigens, further confirming the importance of miRNAs in this regulation. We conclude that miRNAs are involved in regulating the expression of the major T1D autoantigens."
https://openalex.org/W2139732978,"Plasmodium tryptophan-rich proteins are involved in host-parasite interaction and thus potential drug/vaccine targets. Recently, we have described several P. vivax tryptophan-rich antigens (PvTRAgs), including merozoite expressed PvTRAg38, from this noncultivable human malaria parasite. PvTRAg38 is highly immunogenic in humans and binds to host erythrocytes, and this binding is inhibited by the patient sera. This binding is also affected if host erythrocytes were pretreated with chymotrypsin. Here, Band 3 has been identified as the chymotrypsin-sensitive erythrocyte receptor for this parasite protein. Interaction of PvTRAg38 with Band 3 has been mapped to its three different ectodomains (loops 1, 3, and 6) exposed at the surface of the erythrocyte. The binding region of PvTRAg38 to Band3 has been mapped to its sequence, KWVQWKNDKIRSWLSSEW, present at amino acid positions 197-214. The recombinant PvTRAg38 was able to inhibit the parasite growth in in vitro Plasmodium falciparum culture probably by competing with the ligand(s) of this heterologous parasite for the erythrocyte Band 3 receptor. In conclusion, the host-parasite interaction at the molecular level is much more complicated than known so far and should be considered during the development of anti-malarial therapeutics."

Mutations in PAX3 are associated with Waardenburg syndrome (WS), but the mechanism of how mutant PAX3 proteins cause WS remains unclear. Here, we found that PAX3 loads on mitotic chromosomes using its homeodomain. PAX3 WS mutants with mutations in homeodomain lose the ability to bind mitotic chromosomes. Moreover, loading of PAX3 on mitotic chromosomes requires arginine methylation, which is regulated by methyltransferase PRMT5 and demethylase JMJD6. Mutant PAX3 proteins that lose mitotic chromosome localization block cell proliferation and normal development of zebrafish.

https://openalex.org/W2131615168,"Damage to the eye from blast exposure can occur as a result of the overpressure air-wave (primary injury), flying debris (secondary injury), blunt force trauma (tertiary injury), and/or chemical/thermal burns (quaternary injury). In this study, we investigated damage in the contralateral eye after a blast directed at the ipsilateral eye in the C57Bl/6J and DBA/2J mouse. Assessments of ocular health (gross pathology, electroretinogram recordings, optokinetic tracking, optical coherence tomography and histology) were performed at 3, 7, 14 and 28 days post-trauma. Olfactory epithelium and optic nerves were also examined. Anterior pathologies were more common in the DBA/2J than in the C57Bl/6 and could be prevented with non-medicated viscous eye drops. Visual acuity decreased over time in both strains, but was more rapid and severe in the DBA/2J. Retinal cell death was present in approximately 10% of the retina at 7 and 28 days post-blast in both strains. Approximately 60% of the cell death occurred in photoreceptors. Increased oxidative stress and microglial reactivity was detected in both strains, beginning at 3 days post-injury. However, there was no sign of injury to the olfactory epithelium or optic nerve in either strain. Although our model directs an overpressure air-wave at the left eye in a restrained and otherwise protected mouse, retinal damage was detected in the contralateral eye. The lack of damage to the olfactory epithelium and optic nerve, as well as the different timing of cell death as compared to the blast-exposed eye, suggests that the injuries were due to physical contact between the contralateral eye and the housing chamber of the blast device and not propagation of the blast wave through the head. Thus we describe a model of mild blunt eye trauma."

However, we show here that vascular calcification may also occur in the adventitia. The purpose of this work is to help elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying vascular calcification. The calcified lesions were examined by Von Kossa staining in ApoE-/- mice which were fed high fat diets (HFD) for 48 weeks and human subjects aged 60 years and older that had died of coronary heart disease, heart failure or acute renal failure. Explant cultured fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (SMCs)were obtained from rat adventitia and media, respectively. After calcification induction, cells were collected for Alizarin Red S staining. Calcified lesions were observed in the aorta adventitia and coronary artery adventitia of ApoE-/-mice, as well as in the aorta adventitia of human subjects examined. Explant culture of fibroblasts, the primary cell type comprising the adventitia, was successfully induced for calcification after incubation with TGF-β1 (20 ng/ml) + mineralization media for 4 days, and the phenotype conversion vascular adventitia fibroblasts into myofibroblasts was identified. Culture of SMCs, which comprise only a small percentage of all cells in the adventitia, in calcifying medium for 14 days resulted in significant calcification.Vascular calcification can occur in the adventitia. Adventitia calcification may arise from the fibroblasts which were transformed into myofibroblasts or smooth muscle cells."

We report here that the ELF domain of FANCL is required to mediate a non-covalent interaction between FANCL and ubiquitin. The interaction involves the canonical Ile44 patch on ubiquitin, and a functionally conserved patch on FANCL. We show that the interaction is not necessary for the recognition of the core complex, it does not enhance the interaction between FANCL and Ube2T, and is not required for FANCD2 monoubiquitination in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2138650086,"Lactoferrin (LF) is an interesting glycoprotein in the field of bone biology for its regulatory effect on cells involved in bone remodeling, that results compromised in several pathological conditions, as osteoporosis. In a previous study we observed that the coupling of LF and biomimetic hydroxyapatite nanocrystals (HA), a material well-known for its bioactivity and osteoconductive properties, leads to a combined effect in the induction of osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. On the basis of this evidence, the present study is an extension of our previous work aiming to investigate the synergistic effect of the coupling of HA and LF on bone homeostasis. Biomimetic HA nanocrystals were synthesized and functionalized with LF (HA-LF) and then pre-osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) and monocyte/macrophage cells lines (RAW 264.7), using as osteoclastogenesis in vitro model, were cultured separately or in co-culture in presence of HA-LF. The results clearly revealed that HA and LF act in synergism in the regulation of the bone homeostasis, working as anabolic factor for osteoblasts differentiation and bone matrix deposition, and as inhibitor of the osteoclast formation and activity."
https://openalex.org/W1779096793,"Parthenogenesis, unisexuality and triploidy are interesting but poorly studied phenomena occurring in some reptile species. The mourning gecko (Lepidodactylus lugubris) represents a complex of diploid and triploid parthenogenetic mostly all-female populations (males occur quite rarely) widely distributed in coastal areas of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Here, we study karyotypes of a male and two female L. lugubris (LLU) triploid individuals (3n = 66) using comparative painting with Gekko japonicus, Hemidactylus turcicus and H. platyurus chromosome specific probes to visualize the homologous regions and to reveal genus specific rearrangements. Also, we applied a 28S ribosomal DNA probe and Ag-staining to detect nucleolus organizer regions (NORs). Our results suggest that the karyotype of L. lugubris underwent a chromosome fission and a fusion after its divergence from a common ancestor of the Gekko-Hemidactylus group. The NORs were found to be located on one out of three homologs on each of LLU8, LLU15 and LLU18, thus further confirming a hybrid origin of triploid individuals. It seems that three different bisexual populations might have contributed to the origin of this triploid parthenogenetic population. We postulate that the heterozygosity in NOR localization is maintained in the triploid clone studied by the absence of recombination as described in whiptail lizards. The pattern of NOR localizations and homologous regions in males and females, as well as the absence of other detectable karyotypic differences, suggest that males arise spontaneously in all female populations and do not arise from independent hybridizations with different species."
https://openalex.org/W2140376697,"Defensins form a major family of antimicrobial peptides. Recently, human β-defensin 2 and fungal plectasin were shown to be immune-related potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 3 (Kv1.3) channel inhibitors. This work continued to show that the human α-defensins human neutrophil peptide (HNP) 1 and human defensin (HD) 5 are selective Kv1.3 channel inhibitors with 50% inhibition concentration values of 102.0 ± 30.3 nM and 2.2 ± 0.2 μM, respectively. Furthermore, HNP1 was found to inhibit Kv1.3 currents and IL-2 secretion in human CD3(+) T cells. Despite the structural similarity between HNP1 and HD5, HNP1 could simultaneously bind to the S1-S2 linker and the pore region of the Kv1.3 channel as both a toxinlike blocker and a novel modifier, whereas HD5 could only bind to the channel pore region as a toxinlike blocker. As a channel modifier, HNP1 could shift the conductance-voltage relationship curve of the Kv1.3 channel by ∼9.5 mV in the positive direction and could increase the time constant for channel activation through the electrostatic repulsion between the cationic HNP1 anchored in the S1-S2 linker and the positively charged S4 domain of the Kv1.3 channel. Together, these findings reveal that human α-defensins are novel endogenous inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels with distinct interaction mechanisms, which facilitates future research into their adaptive immune functions."

Thus, how these enzymes target their wide array of substrates is of considerable importance for understanding the function of the cell's diverse ubiquitination networks. Here, we characterize a yeast deubiquitinating enzyme, Ubp10, that possesses IDRs flanking its catalytic protease domain.

https://openalex.org/W1598141219,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins provide important information to understand their functional mechanisms, which are, however, likely to be hidden behind their complicated motions with a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. A straightforward and intuitive analysis of protein dynamics observed in MD simulation trajectories is therefore of growing significance with the large increase in both the simulation time and system size. In this study, we propose a novel description of protein motions based on the hierarchical clustering of fluctuations in the inter-atomic distances calculated from an MD trajectory, which constructs a single tree diagram, named a “Motion Tree”, to determine a set of rigid-domain pairs hierarchically along with associated inter-domain fluctuations. The method was first applied to the MD trajectory of substrate-free adenylate kinase to clarify the usefulness of the Motion Tree, which illustrated a clear-cut dynamics picture of the inter-domain motions involving the ATP/AMP lid and the core domain together with the associated amplitudes and correlations. The comparison of two Motion Trees calculated from MD simulations of ligand-free and -bound glutamine binding proteins clarified changes in inherent dynamics upon ligand binding appeared in both large domains and a small loop that stabilized ligand molecule. Another application to a huge protein, a multidrug ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, captured significant increases of fluctuations upon binding a drug molecule observed in both large scale inter-subunit motions and a motion localized at a transmembrane helix, which may be a trigger to the subsequent structural change from inward-open to outward-open states to transport the drug molecule. These applications demonstrated the capabilities of Motion Trees to provide an at-a-glance view of various sizes of functional motions inherent in the complicated MD trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W1657212401,"Underwater noise was recorded from the Wavestar wave energy converter; a full-scale hydraulic point absorber, placed on a jack-up rig on the Danish North Sea coast. Noise was recorded 25 m from the converter with an autonomous recording unit (10 Hz to 20 kHz bandwidth). Median sound pressure levels (Leq) in third-octave bands during operation of the converter were 106-109 dB re. 1 μPa in the range 125-250 Hz, 1-2 dB above ambient noise levels (statistically significant). Outside the range 125-250 Hz the noise from the converter was undetectable above the ambient noise. During start and stop of the converter a more powerful tone at 150 Hz (sound pressure level (Leq) 121-125 dB re 1 μPa) was easily detectable. This tone likely originated from the hydraulic pump which was used to lower the absorbers into the water and lift them out of the water at shutdown. Noise levels from the operating wave converter were so low that they would barely be audible to marine mammals and the likelihood of negative impact from the noise appears minimal. A likely explanation for the low noise emissions is the construction of the converter where all moving parts, except for the absorbers themselves, are placed above water on a jack-up rig. The results may thus not be directly transferable to other wave converter designs but do demonstrate that it is possible to harness wave energy without noise pollution to the marine environment."
https://openalex.org/W2105157721,"Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) play a role as master regulators because of their capacity to form heterodimers with other nuclear receptors (NRs). Accordingly, retinoid signaling is involved in multiple biologic processes, including development, cell differentiation, metabolism, and cell death. However, the role and function of RXRs in different heterodimer complexes remain unidentified, mainly because most RXR drugs (called rexinoids) are not selective of specific heterodimer complexes. The lack of selectivity strongly limits the use of rexinoids for specific therapeutic approaches. To better characterize rexinoids at specific NR complexes, we have developed and optimized luciferase (Luc) protein complementation(PCA)-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays that can directly measure recruitment of a coactivator (CoA) motif fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) by specific NR dimers. To validate the assays, we compared rexinoid modulation of CoA recruitment by the RXR homodimer and by the heterodimers Nur77/RXR and Nurr1/RXR. Results revealed that some rexinoids display selective CoA recruitment activities with homo- or heterodimer complexes. In particular, SR11237 (BMS649) has stronger potency for recruitment of CoA motif and transcriptional activity with the heterodimer Nur77/RXR than other complexes. This technology should be useful in identifying new compounds with specificity for individual dimeric species formed by NRs."
https://openalex.org/W1577019598,"The tumor-suppressor protein p53 is tightly controlled in normal cells by its two negative regulators--the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 and its homolog MDMX. Under stressed conditions such as DNA damage, p53 escapes MDM2- and MDMX-mediated functional inhibition and degradation, acting to prevent damaged cells from proliferating through induction of cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence or apoptosis. Ample evidence suggests that stress signals induce phosphorylation of MDM2 and MDMX, leading to p53 activation. However, the structural basis of stress-induced p53 activation remains poorly understood because of the paucity of technical means to produce site-specifically phosphorylated MDM2 and MDMX proteins for biochemical and biophysical studies. Herein, we report total chemical synthesis, via native chemical ligation, and functional characterization of (24-108)MDMX and its Tyr99-phosphorylated analog with respect to their ability to interact with a panel of p53-derived peptide ligands and PMI, a p53-mimicking but more potent peptide antagonist of MDMX, using FP and surface plasmon resonance techniques. Phosphorylation of MDMX at Tyr99 weakens peptide binding by approximately two orders of magnitude. Comparative X-ray crystallographic analyses of MDMX and of pTyr99 MDMX in complex with PMI as well as modeling studies reveal that the phosphate group of pTyr99 imposes extensive steric clashes with the C-terminus of PMI or p53 peptide and induces a significant lateral shift of the peptide ligand, contributing to the dramatic decrease in the binding affinity of MDMX for p53. Because DNA damage activates c-Abl tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates MDMX at Tyr99, our findings afford a rare glimpse at the structural level of how stress-induced MDMX phosphorylation dislodges p53 from the inhibitory complex and activates it in response to DNA damage."

Although the regulation of Di-Ras1/Di-Ras2 activity remains to be determined, Rap1GAP1 and Rap1GAP2 have been shown to stimulate GTPase activity of Di-Ras in vitro (7Gasper R. Sot B. Wittinghofer A. GTPase activity of Di-Ras proteins is stimulated by Rap1GAP proteins.Small GTPases. 2010; 1: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The biological function of Di-Ras proteins remains elusive. A previous study reported that overexpression of Di-Ras1 inhibited oncogenic H-Ras-induced cellular transformation and transactivation of the transcription factor Elk-1 (5Ellis C.A.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9876-9881Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Di-Ras1 could antagonize H-Ras-mediated signaling by competing for Ras effectors. However, Di-Ras proteins fail to interact with the Ras binding domain of Raf or the Ras association domain of RalGDS (6Kontani K. Tada M. Ogawa T. Okai T. Saito K. Araki Y. Katada T.

Northern blot analysis has shown that Di-Ras1 mRNA is expressed specifically in brain and heart, whereas Di-Ras2 mRNA is specifically expressed in brain (6Kontani K. Tada M. Ogawa T. Okai T. Saito K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41070-41078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that that a Caenorhabditis elegans Di-Ras homolog (drn-1) is expressed specifically in neuronal cells and is involved in the modulation of synaptic activity (8Tada M. Gengyo-Ando K. Kobayashi T. Fukuyama M. Mitani S. Kontani K. Katada T. Neuronally expressed Ras-family GTPase Di-Ras modulates synaptic activity in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genes Cells. 2012; 17: 778-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the present study we sought to characterize the biochemical properties of endogenous Di-Ras proteins. To this end we partially purified Di-Ras2 from rat brain cytosol and found that Di-Ras2 exists as a cytosolic complex with SmgGDS. SmgGDS was originally identified as a GEF for Rap1A and has guanine-nucleotide exchange activity on a number of small GTPases, including various Ras and Rho-family GTPases (9Chuang T.H. Xu X.

Chem. 1990; 265: 16626-16634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, SmgGDS binds tightly to Di-Ras2 without showing GEF activity for Di-Ras2. The affinities of Di-Ras2 for guanine nucleotides are reduced when Di-Ras2 forms a complex with SmgGDS, and the complex formation enhances the protein stability of Di-Ras2. We thus propose that cytosolic Di-Ras2 is in a low affinity state for guanine nucleotides because it forms a complex with SmgGDS. Monoclonal antibodies against Di-Ras1 or Di-Ras2 were generated using a previously reported method (14Tamatani T. Miyasaka M. Identification of monoclonal antibodies reactive with the rat homolog of ICAM-1, and evidence for a differential involvement of ICAM-1 in the adherence of resting versus activated lymphocytes to high endothelial cells.Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Briefly, female WKY/Ncrj rats were immunized in the hind footpads with purified recombinant Di-Ras1 or Di-Ras2 proteins (produced in Escherichia coli). Interiliac lymph node cells from these rats were then fused with the mouse myeloma cell line PAI to produce hybridoma cells. Hybridoma cell culture media were then screened by ELISA to select clones that produced antibodies specific for Di-Ras1 or Di-Ras2. The specificity and titer of the selected clones were then determined by Western blotting. Other antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-GAPDH (Millipore), anti-SmgGDS (anti-Rap1GDS1) (Sigma), anti-N-Ras (Santa Cruz), anti-R-Ras (BD Pharmingen), anti-Na+/K+ ATPase α-subunit (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma). Whole brain (∼40 g) of adult male Donryu rats was washed with a 5-fold volume of ice-cold TBS (20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) and homogenized in 400 ml of a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.025 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF). The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was then further centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min, and the clear supernatant (cytosol fraction, ∼350 ml) was stored at −80 °C until use. For purification of Di-Ras2, the cytosol fraction (160 ml) was applied to a Q-Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare, 2.2 × 15 cm, 60-ml bed volume) equilibrated with 240 ml of a common purification buffer, TMD (consisting of 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT), containing 40 mm NaCl. The column was washed with ∼60 ml of the equilibration buffer and then eluted with a 300-ml linear gradient of 40–225 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The obtained fractions were subjected to dot-blot analysis using anti-Di-Ras2 antibody. The fractions containing Di-Ras2 (∼50 ml eluted at ∼130 mm NaCl) were concentrated to ∼6 ml using an Amicon Ultra-15 ml 30-kDa Centrifugal Filters (Merck Millipore) and then applied to Sephacryl S-300 HR column (GE Healthcare, 2.6 × 60 cm, 320-ml bed volume) equilibrated with TMD containing 150 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted from the column at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The fractions containing Di-Ras2 (∼15 ml) were mixed with KPi to obtain a final concentration of 20 mm and applied to a ceramic-hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad, 1.0 × 4 cm, 3-ml bed volume) equilibrated with TMD containing 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm KPi. The column was washed with 5 ml of the equilibration buffer and eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 20–150 mm KPi at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions containing Di-Ras2 (∼4 ml eluted at 70∼100 mm KPi) were diluted with a 2–3-fold volume of TMD and applied to a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare, 0.5 × 3 cm, 0.6 ml-bed volume) equilibrated with TMD containing 30 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 2 ml of the equilibration buffer and then eluted with a 10-ml linear gradient of 30–200 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Di-Ras2 was eluted from the column at ∼100 mm NaCl. For a phenyl-Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare), the fractions containing Di-Ras2 were diluted with an equal volume of TMD containing 500 mm (NH4)2SO4 and applied to the hydrophobic column (0.5 × 2.5 cm, 0.5-ml bed volume) equilibrated with TMD containing 250 mm (NH4)2SO4. The column was washed with 5 ml of the equilibration buffer and eluted with a 5-ml linear gradient of 250–0 mm (NH4)2SO4 and an additional 20 ml of TMD at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Di-Ras2 was eluted from the column at the gradient end to 0 mm (NH4)2SO4 as a broad peak, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A 55-kDa band co-migrating with Di-Ras2 in various purification steps including the phenyl-Sepharose chromatography (see Fig. 2 and Table 1) was excised from the acrylamide gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry.TABLE 1Summary of purification of Di-Ras2·SmgGDS from rat brain cytosolPurification stepsFraction volumeTotal proteinsAmountImmunoreactive proteins: Di-Ras2·SmgGDSAmountConcentrationConcentrationSpecific activity-Fold purificationRecoverymlmgmg/mlpmolpmol/mlpmol/mg×%Cytosol1604803.07200/NSaNS, not shown.

Open table in a new tab Protein solutions containing Di-Ras2 were heat-denatured at ∼90 °C for 3 min and separated from the denatured proteins by centrifugation with an Amicon Ultra 0.5-ml 30-kDa centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore). The filters were further washed with 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), and both filtrates were combined in the total volume of 1 ml and applied to Mono Q column (0.5 × 5 cm, 1 ml-bed volume) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) and 50 mm LiCl. The column was washed with the equilibration buffer, and guanine nucleotides were eluted with a 5.25-ml linear gradient of 50–500 mm LiCl at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The eluate was monitored at 254 nm; GDP and GTP were eluted from the column at ∼230 and ∼300 mm LiCl, respectively, with >90% recovery. Whole brain from adult male C57BL/6J mice was washed with TBS and homogenized in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 10% (w/v) sucrose, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm AEBSF. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet (membrane fraction) was washed, resuspended in the homogenization buffer, and stored at −80 °C until use. The supernatant from the first 30,000 × g spin was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min, and the clear supernatant (cytosol fraction) and the residual pellet (microsome fraction) were stored at −80 °C until use. The following cDNAs corresponding to the indicated residues were subcloned into pGEX6P-1 (GE Healthcare) for the production of recombinant proteins in E. coli: mouse Di-Ras1 (NCBI reference sequence NP_660252.1, amino acid residues 1–194), mouse Di-Ras2 (NCBI reference sequence NP_001019645.1, amino acid residues 1–195), human Di-Ras2 (NCBI reference sequence NP_060064.2, amino acid residues 1–195), human RhoA (NCBI reference sequence NP_001655.1, amino acid residues 1–189) and human SmgGDS (NCBI reference sequence NP_001093898.1, amino acid residues 1–559). The cDNA of mouse SmgGDS (NCBI reference sequence NP_663519.2, amino acid residues 1–558) was subcloned into pCold-TF (TaKaRa). Point mutants in human SmgGDS were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. GST fusion proteins were induced in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus DE3 (Stratagene) harboring the corresponding plasmid with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 20 °C for 16 h. Recombinant proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) and then digested with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) to remove GST moieties. The digested proteins were applied to a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with another common buffer, TMDN (consisting of 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 100 mm NaCl) for SmgGDS or TMDN containing 0.1% (w/v) Lubrol PX (Nakalai Tesque) for Di-Ras2 and RhoA. The fractions containing recombinant proteins were collected and stored at −80 °C until use. His-tagged trigger-factor fusion proteins of SmgGDS (His-TF-SmgGDS) were induced at 15 °C for 24 h and purified with Ni2+-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare). His-TF-SmgGDS proteins were applied to a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with TMDN, and the fractions containing recombinant proteins were stored at −80 °C until use. Recombinant Di-Ras2 was incubated with His-TF (as a negative control) or His-TF-SmgGDS and further incubated with Ni2+-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed with an ice-cold wash buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, and the proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. [35S]GTPγS (a non-hydrolysable GTP analog) or [3H]GDP binding assays were performed as described previously (15Kawazu M. Ueno T. Kontani K. Ogita Y. Ando M. Fukumura K. Yamato A. Soda M. Takeuchi K.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 3029-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, purified small GTPases (5–10 pmol) were incubated at 30 °C with 1 μm [35S]GTPγS (20,000 cpm/pmol) or 5 μm [3H]GDP (4000–6000 cpm/pmol) in the presence or absence of SmgGDS (40 pmol) in 50 μl of TMDN containing 0.002% (w/v) Lubrol PX and 100 μg/ml BSA. After incubation at 30 °C for various time periods, the amount of [35S]GTPγS or [3H]GDP bound to the proteins was determined by a nitrocellulose-filter binding method as described previously (6Kontani K. Tada M. Ogawa T. Okai T. Saito K. Araki Y. Katada T. Di-Ras, a distinct subgroup of ras family GTPases with unique biochemical properties.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41070-41078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). RhoA or Di-Ras2 (5–10 pmol) was incubated for the appropriate time periods (6 h and 30 min for RhoA and Di-Ras2, respectively) with [35S]GTPγS (1 μm) or [3H]GDP (5 μm) in 40 μl of TMDN containing 0.002% (w/v) Lubrol PX and 100 μg/ml BSA. SmgGDS or vehicle was then added to the reaction mixture and incubated for various time periods, and the amount of [35S]GTPγS or [3H]GDP bound to the proteins was then determined by the nitrocellulose-filter binding method described above. Di-Ras2 (0.6 μm) or RhoA (0.6 μm) was incubated with 5 μm GTPγS in the presence or absence of SmgGDS (4 μm) at 30 °C for 30 min in 500 μl of TMDN containing 0.015% (w/v) Lubrol PX and 150 μg/ml BSA. The reaction mixture was separated by Superdex 200 prep grade (GE Healthcare) column chromatography (1.6 × 50 cm, 80-ml bed volume). Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were transfected with 2 or 5 μg (for 6- or 10-cm dishes, respectively) of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 and incubated for 24–48 h for subsequent experiments. HEK293T cells were transfected with a FLAG-tagged Di-Ras2 expression vector with or without a Myc-tagged SmgGDS expression vector. Guanine nucleotides associated with FLAG-Di-Ras2 were analyzed as described previously (6Kontani K. Tada M. Ogawa T. Okai T. Saito K. Araki Y. Katada T.

In brief, 48 h after transfection, the cells were labeled for 2 h with 32Pi (1.85 MBq/dish) in phosphate-free DMEM. The labeled cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of ice-cold TMDN containing 1% (w/v) Lubrol PX, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm AEBSF, and the cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 agarose affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C for 15 min. After washing the affinity gel with ice-cold TMDN containing 0.1% (w/v) Lubrol PX, the associated nucleotides were separated by thin-layer chromatography followed by detection and quantitation using a BAS-1500 imaging analyzer (Fuji film). Pulse-chase analysis was performed basically as described previously (16Bonifacino J.S. Metabolic labeling with amino acids.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2001; (Chapter 7, Unit 7.1)Crossref Google Scholar). In brief, HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-Di-Ras2 with or without Myc-SmgGDS were pulse-labeled for 1 h with EasyTag Express-[35S] Protein Labeling Mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (2.775 MBq/dish) and chased for up to 48 h. At each time point cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of an ice-cold lysis buffer and clarified followed by incubation with anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing, the immunocomplexes were eluted with an ice-cold wash buffer containing 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was analyzed using Typhoon FLA9000 phosphorimaging (GE Healthcare). We previously reported that the mRNAs of human Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2 are expressed in brain (6Kontani K. Tada M. Ogawa T. Okai T. Saito K. Araki Y. Katada T. Di-Ras, a distinct subgroup of ras family GTPases with unique biochemical properties.J. Biol.

To investigate the protein expression of Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2, we generated monoclonal antibodies against Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2, among which clones 6B10 and 2D6 specifically recognized Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2, respectively, with comparable titers (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of rat tissue extracts with the antibody 2D6 detected Di-Ras2 specifically in rat brain extracts (Fig. 1B), whereas Di-Ras1 was not detected in these extracts (data not shown). We then conducted centrifugation-based subcellular fractionation of mouse brain to determine the distribution of Di-Ras2. N-Ras and R-Ras are detected only in membrane fractions (17Hansen M.

During the course of the purification, we noticed an ∼55-kDa protein co-purifying with Di-Ras2 (Fig. 2, A–D). The 55-kDa protein band was excised from SDS-PAGE gels and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, which identified the protein as rat SmgGDS (accession number NP_001101198.1). M"
https://openalex.org/W1889539368,"A single nucleotide polymorphism in the ZNF804A gene, rs1344706, is associated with schizophrenia. The polymorphism has been suggested to alter fetal expression of ZNF804A. It has also been reported to be associated with altered cortical functioning and neural connectivity in the brain. Since developmental mechanisms are suggested in the pathophysiology for schizophrenia, expression of Zfp804A, the rat homolog of ZNF804A, was investigated in the developing rat brain. We found that expression of Zfp804A in most brain regions is developmentally regulated and peaks around birth, where after it decreases towards adult levels. This time point is developmentally the equivalent to the second trimester of fetal development in humans. An exception to this expression pattern is the hippocampus where the expression of Zfp804A appears to increase again in the adult brain. Using laser capture and quantitative PCR we found that Zfp804A mRNA expression in the adult rat hippocampus is highest in the CA1 sub region, where the overall firing rates of neurons is higher than in the CA3 region. In cultured cortical neurons Zfp804A mRNA expression peaked at day 4 and then decreased. The ZFP804A protein expression was therefore investigated with immunochemistry in such cultures. Interestingly, before day 4, the protein is mostly found in the perinuclear region of the cell but at day 4, ZFP804A was instead found throughout the cell and particularly in the growth cones. In conclusion we demonstrate that Zfp804A increases in the rat brain at the time of birth, coinciding with neuronal differentiation. We also show that ZFP804A is localized to growth cones of growing neurites. These data implicate ZFP804A in growth cone function and neurite elongation. The polymorphism rs1344706 lowers expression of ZNF804A during prenatal brain development. This may affect ZNF804A's role in cone function and neurite elongation leading to synaptic deficits and altered neural connectivity."

https://openalex.org/W2152765776,"Six decades ago the DI*A allele of the Diego blood group system was instrumental in proving Native American populations originated from Siberia. Since then, it has received scant attention. The present study was undertaken to reappraise distribution of the DI*A allele in 144 Native American populations based on current knowledge. Using analysis of variance tests, frequency distribution was studied according to geographical, environmental, and cultural parameters. Frequencies were highest in Amazonian populations. In contrast, DI*A was undetectable in subarctic, Fuegian, Panamanian, Chaco and Yanomama populations. Closer study revealed a correlation that this unequal distribution was correlated with language, suggesting that linguistic divergence was a driving force in the expansion of DI*A among Native Americans. The absence of DI*A in circumpolar Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dene speakers was consistent with a late migratory event confined to North America. Distribution of DI*A in subtropical areas indicated that gene and culture exchanges were more intense within than between ecozones. Bolstering the utility of classical genetic markers in biological anthropology, the present study of the expansion of Diego blood group genetic polymorphism in Native Americans shows strong evidence of gene-culture comigration."
https://openalex.org/W1930522881,"Studies of adaptation in the wild grass Anthoxanthum odoratum at the Park Grass Experiment (PGE) provided one of the earliest examples of rapid evolution in plants. Anthoxanthum has become locally adapted to differences in soil Al toxicity, which have developed there due to soil acidification from long-term experimental fertilizer treatments. In this study, we used transcriptome sequencing to identify Al stress responsive genes in Anthoxanhum and identify candidates among them for further molecular study of rapid Al tolerance evolution at the PGE. We examined the Al content of Anthoxanthum tissues and conducted RNA-sequencing of root tips, the primary site of Al induced damage. We found that despite its high tolerance Anthoxanthum is not an Al accumulating species. Genes similar to those involved in organic acid exudation (TaALMT1, ZmMATE), cell wall modification (OsSTAR1), and internal Al detoxification (OsNRAT1) in cultivated grasses were responsive to Al exposure. Expression of a large suite of novel loci was also triggered by early exposure to Al stress in roots. Three-hundred forty five transcripts were significantly more up- or down-regulated in tolerant vs. sensitive Anthoxanthum genotypes, providing important targets for future study of rapid evolution at the PGE."

Yet in the current literature, less was known regarding the psychological reasons why people engage in promotive voice. Through the lens of social exchange, we proposed that employees who received support from colleagues may develop higher level of felt obligation for constructive change which leads to promotive voice. Analyses of multi-source data from 51 cross-functional sources (51 team supervisors and 162 employees) showed that employees’ felt obligation for constructive change positively mediates the relationship between colleague support and promotive voice behavior. Moreover, the impact of colleague support on felt obligation for constructive change is stronger when there is a low level of subgroup formation in the team. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1608088030,"Although the protein translation inhibition activity of ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) is well documented, little is known about the contribution of the lectin chain to the biological activity of these proteins. In this study, we compared the in vitro and intracellular activity of several S. nigra (elderberry) RIPs and non-RIP lectins. Our data demonstrate that RIPs from elderberry are much more toxic to HeLa cells than to primary fibroblasts. Differences in the cytotoxicity between the elderberry proteins correlated with differences in glycan specificity of their lectin domain, cellular uptake efficiency and intracellular destination. Despite the fact that the bulk of the RIPs accumulated in the lysosomes and partly in the Golgi apparatus, we could demonstrate effective inhibition of protein synthesis in cellula. As we also observed cytotoxicity for non-RIP lectins, it is clear that the lectin chain triggers additional pathways heralding cell death. Our data suggest that one of these pathways involves the induction of autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2156886672,"We aimed to investigate whether 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) modulates glycometabolism and has toxicity in Eri silkworm (Samia cynthia ricini, Saturniidae). In this paper, hemolymph metabolites were used to explore metabolic changes after oral administration of DNJ or mulberry latex and to characterize the biological function of DNJ at the metabolic and systemic levels. Hemolymph samples were collected from fourth-instar larvae of Eri silkworm and ex-vivo high-resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired from the collected hemolymph samples. Then the obtained spectra were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and independent-samples t-test. Metabolic pattern recognition analysis of hemolymph samples indicated that the groups of 0.25% DNJ, latex, and the mixture of 0.5% DNJ and latex (1:1) were significantly different from the control group. Moreover, compared to the control group, the groups of 0.25% DNJ, latex, and the mixture of 0.5% DNJ and latex (1:1) showed the decreased levels of citrate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and glutamine in hemolymph, the groups of 0.25% DNJ and the mixture of 0.5% DNJ and latex (1:1) showed the increased levels of trehalose and lactate. In addition, mulberry leaves exude latex was highly toxic to Eri silkworm because rich unidentified high-molecular-weight factor (s) acted as toxic substances. In our results, latex caused 20 deaths among 50 fourth-instar larvae of Eri silkmoth, but DNJ or the mixture did not caused death. All these results suggest that DNJ has a positive impact on the reverse glycometabolism by modulating glycometabolism and inhibiting glucogenesis and energy metabolism. DNJ is a secure substance as a single-ingredient antidiabetic medicine due to its nontoxicity and bioactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2143850102,"Oxidant production from DUOX1 has been proposed to lead to neutrophil recruitment into the airways when lung homeostasis is compromised. The objective of this study was to determine whether DUOX-derived hydrogen peroxide is required for LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment, using a functional DUOX knock out mouse model. We found that LPS induced profound neutrophilic lung inflammation in both Duoxa(+/+)and Duoxa(-/-) mice between 3h and 24h. Duoxa(-/-) mice had significantly higher neutrophil influx 24h after LPS instillation despite similar cytokine levels (KC, MIP-2, or TGF-α) between the two groups. These findings suggest that LPS-TLR-4-induced KC or MIP-2 cytokine induction and subsequent neutrophil recruitment in the airway does not require DUOX-derived hydrogen peroxide from airway epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W783647272,"Most current studies investigating semantic memory have focused on associative (ring-emerald) or taxonomic relations (bird-sparrow). Little is known about the question of how causal relations (virus-epidemic) are stored and accessed in semantic memory. The goal of this study was to examine the processing of causally related, general associatively related and hierarchically related word pairs when participants were required to evaluate whether pairs of words were related in any way. The ERP data showed that the N400 amplitude (200-500 ms) elicited by unrelated related words was more negative than all related words. Furthermore, the late frontal distributed negativity (500-700 ms) elicited by causally related words was smaller than hierarchically related words, but not for general associated words. These results suggested the processing of causal relations and hierarchical relations in semantic memory recruited different degrees of cognitive resources, especially for role binding."
https://openalex.org/W822946650,"In May of 2009, the bloom-forming diatom Didymosphenia geminata was first identified in the Upper Esopus Creek, a key tributary to the New York City water-supply and a popular recreational stream. The Upper Esopus receives supplemental flows from the Shandaken Portal, an underground aqueduct delivering waters from a nearby basin. The presence of D. geminata is a concern for the local economy, water supply, and aquatic ecosystem because nuisance blooms have been linked to degraded stream condition in other regions. Here we ascertain the extent and severity of the D. geminata invasion, determine the impact of supplemental flows from the Portal on D. geminata, and identify potential factors that may limit D. geminata in the watershed. Stream temperature, discharge, and water quality were characterized at select sites and periphyton samples were collected five times at 6 to 20 study sites between 2009 and 2010 to assess standing crop, diatom community structure, and density of D. geminata and all diatoms. Density of D. geminata ranged from 0-12 cells cm(-2) at tributary sites, 0-781 cells cm(-2) at sites upstream of the Portal, and 0-2,574 cells cm(-2) at sites downstream of the Portal. Survey period and Portal (upstream or downstream) each significantly affected D. geminata cell density. In general, D. geminata was most abundant during the November 2009 and June 2010 surveys and at sites immediately downstream of the Portal. We found that D. geminata did not reach nuisance levels or strongly affect the periphyton community. Similarly, companion studies showed that local macroinvertebrate and fish communities were generally unaffected. A number of abiotic factors including variable flows and moderate levels of phosphorous and suspended sediment may limit blooms of D. geminata in this watershed."
