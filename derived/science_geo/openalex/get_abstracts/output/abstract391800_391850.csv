https://openalex.org/W2123347941,"Although most tissues in an organism are genetically identical, the biochemistry of each is optimized to fulfill its unique physiological roles, with important consequences for human health and disease. Each tissue's unique physiology requires tightly regulated gene and protein expression coordinated by specialized, phosphorylation-dependent intracellular signaling. To better understand the role of phosphorylation in maintenance of physiological differences among tissues, we performed proteomic and phosphoproteomic characterizations of nine mouse tissues. We identified 12,039 proteins, including 6296 phosphoproteins harboring nearly 36,000 phosphorylation sites. Comparing protein abundances and phosphorylation levels revealed specialized, interconnected phosphorylation networks within each tissue while suggesting that many proteins are regulated by phosphorylation independently of their expression. Our data suggest that the ""typical"" phosphoprotein is widely expressed yet displays variable, often tissue-specific phosphorylation that tunes protein activity to the specific needs of each tissue. We offer this dataset as an online resource for the biological research community."
https://openalex.org/W2130001957,"The woodland strawberry, Fragaria vesca (2n = 2x = 14), is a versatile experimental plant system. This diminutive herbaceous perennial has a small genome (240 Mb), is amenable to genetic transformation and shares substantial sequence identity with the cultivated strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) and other economically important rosaceous plants. Here we report the draft F. vesca genome, which was sequenced to ×39 coverage using second-generation technology, assembled de novo and then anchored to the genetic linkage map into seven pseudochromosomes. This diploid strawberry sequence lacks the large genome duplications seen in other rosids. Gene prediction modeling identified 34,809 genes, with most being supported by transcriptome mapping. Genes critical to valuable horticultural traits including flavor, nutritional value and flowering time were identified. Macrosyntenic relationships between Fragaria and Prunus predict a hypothetical ancestral Rosaceae genome that had nine chromosomes. New phylogenetic analysis of 154 protein-coding genes suggests that assignment of Populus to Malvidae, rather than Fabidae, is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2032919119,"The adipocyte-derived secretory factor adiponectin promotes insulin sensitivity, decreases inflammation and promotes cell survival. No unifying mechanism has yet explained how adiponectin can exert such a variety of beneficial systemic effects. Here, we show that adiponectin potently stimulates a ceramidase activity associated with its two receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, and enhances ceramide catabolism and formation of its antiapoptotic metabolite--sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)--independently of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK). Using models of inducible apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells and cardiomyocytes, we show that transgenic overproduction of adiponectin decreases caspase-8-mediated death, whereas genetic ablation of adiponectin enhances apoptosis in vivo through a sphingolipid-mediated pathway. Ceramidase activity is impaired in cells lacking both adiponectin receptor isoforms, leading to elevated ceramide levels and enhanced susceptibility to palmitate-induced cell death. Combined, our observations suggest a unifying mechanism of action for the beneficial systemic effects exerted by adiponectin, with sphingolipid metabolism as its core upstream signaling component."

Using E. coli as proof of principle, we show that combining large-scale chemical genomics with quantitative fitness measurements provides a high-quality data set rich in discovery. Probing growth profiles of a mutant library in hundreds of conditions in parallel yielded > 10,000 phenotypes that allowed us to study gene essentiality, discover leads for gene function and drug action, and understand higher-order organization of the bacterial chromosome. We highlight new information derived from the study, including insights into a gene involved in multiple antibiotic resistance and the synergy between a broadly used combinatory antibiotic therapy, trimethoprim and sulfonamides. This data set, publicly available at http://ecoliwiki.net/tools/chemgen/, is a valuable resource for both the microbiological and bioinformatic communities, as it provides high-confidence associations between hundreds of annotated and uncharacterized genes as well as inferences about the mode of action of several poorly understood drugs.

Phenomic profiling of E. coli identifies thousands of mutant growth phenotypes Patterns of growth phenotypes reveal new functional connections between genes Uncharacterized genes linked to many phenotypes tend to be evolutionarily restricted Mutant phenotypes generate insights into drug mode of action and drug synergy Before the physical basis of genes was understood, associating phenotypes with a heritable unit laid the foundation of modern genetics. Following discovery of the genetic code, linking a phenotype to the responsible gene remained the most expeditious way to unravel gene function. With the explosion of sequence information, the balance has shifted. We now have many genes of unknown function. To capitalize on the burgeoning sequence bank, it is imperative to develop high-throughput technologies that link genes to phenotypes and expedite discovery of gene function. This is particularly true for prokaryotes, which represent a major fraction of the sequenced genomes and are in the forefront of metagenomic efforts (Qin et al., 2010Qin J. Li R. Raes J. Arumugam M. Burgdorf K.S. Manichanh C. Nielsen T. Pons N. Levenez F. Yamada T. et al.MetaHIT ConsortiumA human gut microbial gene catalogue established by metagenomic sequencing.Nature. 2010; 464: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (6160) Google Scholar). Chemical and environmental perturbations have traditionally linked phenotypes to genotypes through forward genetic screens, but reverse genetic approaches are being increasingly utilized (Barker et al., 2010Barker C.A. Farha M.A. Brown E.D. Chemical genomic approaches to study model microbes.Chem. Biol. 2010; 17: 624-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Phenotype microarrays utilize a high-resolution readout of cellular respiration to evaluate fitness of a strain in hundreds of conditions (Bochner, 2009Bochner B.R. Global phenotypic characterization of bacteria.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2009; 33: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This approach is appropriate for studying a few strains but is difficult to expand to genome-scale screens. In pooled growth competitions, thousands of strains are assayed in a single culture environment. Fitness values are derived from measuring strain abundance in a test relative to control condition (Giaever et al., 2004Giaever G. Flaherty P. Kumm J. Proctor M. Nislow C. Jaramillo D.F. Chu A.M.

These approaches are very efficient, but competition between strains in each condition makes it difficult to determine relative strain growth across conditions (Girgis et al., 2009Girgis H.S. Hottes A.K. Tavazoie S. Genetic architecture of intrinsic antibiotic susceptibility.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5629Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), especially for strains that grow slowly even in the absence of perturbation (Lee et al., 2005Lee W.

Arraying mutant strains on solid media allows independent evaluation of strain fitness but has been used only for low-resolution measurements of entire libraries (Liu et al., 2010Liu A. Tran L.

Bussey H. et al.Systematic genetic analysis with ordered arrays of yeast deletion mutants.Science. 2001; 294: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar), are complementary to chemical genomics approaches. Such analyses quantitatively measure colony growth of double mutants in high-density format on agar surfaces and have led to numerous successes in identifying gene function and network organization (Beltrao et al., 2010Beltrao P. Cagney G. Krogan N.J. Quantitative genetic interactions reveal biological modularity.Cell. 2010; 141: 739-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Similar methodology has been developed for E. coli (Butland et al., 2008Butland G. Babu M. Díaz-Mejía J.J. Bohdana F. Phanse S. Gold B. Yang W. Li J. Gagarinova A.G. Pogoutse O. et al.eSGA: E. coli synthetic genetic array analysis.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, Typas et al., 2008Typas A. Nichols R.J. Siegele D.A.

Methods. 2008; 5: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We use E. coli to illustrate the power of applying the high-resolution quantitative fitness measurements of genetic interaction analysis to high-throughput phenotypic analysis of culturable microbes. “Phenomic profiling” provides a quantitative description of the response of all single-gene deletions to physiologically relevant stresses and drug challenges. By profiling ∼4000 genes in > 300 perturbations, we identified thousands of phenotypes and a diverse suite of conditionally essential genes. This approach provides new insights into the chromosome organization, functional landscape, and evolutionary trajectory of E. coli. It facilitates high-confidence association of genes of unknown function to those of known function, as highlighted by discovery of the role of a gene involved in multiple antibiotic resistance in this manuscript and identification of two lipoproteins essential for peptidoglycan synthesis (Typas et al., 2010Typas A. Banzhaf M. van den Berg van Saparoea B. Verheul J. Biboy J. Nichols R.J. Zietek M. Beilharz K.

Finally, the degree to which various gene deletions alter toxic drug effects has led to powerful insights regarding drug mode of action (Kohanski et al., 2008Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Wierzbowski J. Cottarel G. Collins J.J. Mistranslation of membrane proteins and two-component system activation trigger antibiotic-mediated cell death.Cell. 2008; 135: 679-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), and we demonstrate that our analysis generates numerous leads concerning drug function. We determined quantitative growth scores for the Keio single-gene deletion library (Baba et al., 2006Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H.

Biol. 2006; 2 (2006.0008)Crossref Scopus (4705) Google Scholar); essential gene hypomorphs (C-terminally tandem-affinity tagged [Butland et al., 2005Butland G. Peregrín-Alvarez J.M. Li J. Yang W. Yang X. Canadien V. Starostine A. Richards D. Beattie B. Krogan N. et al.Interaction network containing conserved and essential protein complexes in Escherichia coli.Nature. 2005; 433: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar] or specific alleles); and a small RNA/small protein knockout library (Hobbs et al., 2010Hobbs E.C. Astarita J.L. Storz G. Small RNAs and small proteins involved in resistance to cell envelope stress and acid shock in Escherichia coli: analysis of a bar-coded mutant collection.J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in conditions representing the range of stresses that E. coli encounters. Mutant strains arrayed in high density on agar plates (1536 colonies/plate) were grown in 324 conditions covering 114 unique stresses (Figure 1A and Figure S1A and Table S1 available online). Colony sizes were analyzed and converted to a drug-gene score using an approach developed for quantifying genetic interactions (see Extended Experimental Procedures). More than half of the conditions were antibiotic/antimicrobial treatments (Figure 1A). By using a subinhibitory concentration series that maximally inhibited growth of the wild-type (WT) strain ≤ 50%, we were able to search for specific drug-gene interactions (Figure S1A) and reduce the ability of spontaneous suppressor mutations to overtake the colony. Two independently derived clones of each mutant strain were analyzed (for sRNA mutants, a single isolate was arrayed twice), and screens were performed at least twice, enabling scores to be based on four to six independent measurements. Correlation between replicate colony size measurements was very high (r = 0.77; Figure 1B). The final data set (Table S2) was comprised of scores for the 3979 mutant strains passing quality control (e.g., proper normalized colony size distribution and replicate reproducibility; see Extended Experimental Procedures). The entire data set is available in an interactive, searchable format and as a flat file on the E. coli wiki website (at http://ecoliwiki.net/tools/chemgen/).Figure S1Colony Plates Illustrate High-Density Arrayed Screening, and Phenotypic Signatures Reproduce Known Connections between Biological Pathways, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Representative plates show the high-density array format used in our screens (1536 colonies/plate) and demonstrate the high-resolution condition-gene interactions (condition-gene interactions may be detected only under specific concentrations) identified by screening a range of drug concentrations (Vancomycin).(B) Phenotypic signatures reproduce known connections between biological pathways.

Download figure for higher resolution. The entire matrix (3979 mutants × 324 conditions) was subjected to two-dimensional (2D) hierarchical clustering (Figure 1C). Drugs with similar effects cluster on the x axis; mutants that behaved similarly cluster on the y axis. Notably, concentrations of the same drug, drugs of the same family, and/or similar conditions clustered together, as did mutants of genes known to be part of the same operon, biological pathway, and/or protein complex. Zoomed insets of our clustergram illustrate examples. Genes in the rfa operon (rfaG, rfaP, rfaQ, rfaB and rfaI), which encodes enzymes that synthesize the inner- and outer-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core, strongly cluster together with three/four genes that are responsible for the synthesis of one of the sugar building blocks, ADP-L glycero-β-D-manno heptose (rfaD, rfaE, and lpcA). Importantly, clustering reflects their shared sensitivities to a concentration series of compounds known to perturb the envelope integrity of the cell, consistent with the role of LPS. dsbA and dsbB, encoded in different operons, also cluster. The DsbA/DsbB complex generates disulfide bridges in the periplasm. The response of each mutant strain across all conditions is denoted as its “phenotypic signature.” High correlation between two phenotypic signatures is highly predictive of known indicators of functional connection between genes. Gene pairs with correlation coefficients (r) between 0.6 and 0.8 (p < 10−34) are more than 100-fold enriched for genes sharing common operon membership and 150-fold enriched for genes with known protein interactions determined from low-throughput experiments (http://www.ecocyc.org; Figure 1D). This benchmarking analysis indicates that our phenomics data set is biologically meaningful. Correlated phenotypic signatures also reproduce connections between curated biological pathways (Figure S1B). For example, electron transfer components cluster tightly (e.g., nuo genes encoding NADH dehydrogenase I complex; Figure 1C). Their clustering reflects high sensitivity to membrane-perturbing stresses, including detergents, dyes, and metals, and increased resistance to aminoglycosides, in agreement with early studies that illustrate decreased aminoglycoside uptake in the absence of a fully functional electron transport chain (Girgis et al., 2009Girgis H.S. Hottes A.K. Tavazoie S. Genetic architecture of intrinsic antibiotic susceptibility.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5629Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, Taber et al., 1987Taber H.W. Mueller J.P. Miller P.F. Arrow A.S. Bacterial uptake of aminoglycoside antibiotics.Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 439-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All three examples described in Figure 1C are consistent with the expectation that highly correlated phenotypic signatures are biologically meaningful (r ≥ 0.6−0.8). A central goal of this study was to systematically evaluate the impact of every gene deletion on E. coli fitness in diverse environments, as few gene deletions in E. coli have robust reported growth phenotypes, and only 8% of the genes are essential in rich media (Baba et al., 2006Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Construction of Escherichia coli K-12 in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants: the Keio collection.Mol. Syst.

Hasegawa M. et al.Update on the Keio collection of Escherichia coli single-gene deletion mutants.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 335Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We used a statistical method to define a reliable phenotype. In brief, we standardized the interquartile range of the distribution of scores for each screen and then determined the probability that each condition-gene interaction represented a true phenotype using a normal cumulative distribution function (see Extended Experimental Procedures). Using a 5% probability that these phenotypes arose by chance as a cutoff (false discovery rate [FDR] ≤ 5%), 49% of all strains tested (1957/3979 strains; Figure 2A ) had one or more phenotypes. We refer to these genes as the “responsive genome.” This responsive genome is a work in progress, as it is limited to genes whose removal causes growth phenotypes in response to the stresses tested. Expanding the stresses tested and/or the readout (e.g., motility) will certainly increase this number (Girgis et al., 2007Girgis H.S. Liu Y. Ryu W.S. Tavazoie S. A comprehensive genetic characterization of bacterial motility.PLoS Genet. 2007; 3: 1644-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A cumulative plot of the number of individual phenotypes per strain shows that very few genes have many phenotypes. Multi-stress responsive (MSR) strains (≥30 phenotypes; Table S3) participate in many cellular processes, suggesting that our stresses encompassed diverse cellular challenges (Figure 2B). With a stringent cutoff of 5% FDR, the maximum number of phenotypes from a single screen was 173 (∼4% strains; Figure S2A ), and the total number of phenotypes (13497) represents ∼1% of all condition-gene pairs tested. Overall, 80% of the phenotypes were negative (gene deletion more sensitive) and 20% positive (gene deletion more resistant), consistent with recent genetic interaction analyses in S. cerevisiae (Fiedler et al., 2009Fiedler D. Braberg H. Mehta M. Chechik G. Cagney G. Mukherjee P. Silva A.C. Shales M. Collins S.R. van Wageningen S. et al.Functional organization of the S. cerevisiae phosphorylation network.Cell. 2009; 136: 952-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and S. pombe (Roguev et al., 2008Roguev A.

Hayles J. et al.Conservation and rewiring of functional modules revealed by an epistasis map in fission yeast.Science. 2008; 322: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This suggests that removal of a gene product is more likely to decrease than enhance resistance to stress (Figure S2B). In summary, our analysis captured numerous highly specific condition-gene responses. Clearly, this data set can be used to assign more phenotypes at a lower confidence level. Indeed, a recent chemical genomics data set in S. cerevisiae reported phenotypes for more than 95% of gene deletions tested, many stemming from a handful of severe stresses (Hillenmeyer et al., 2008Hillenmeyer M.E. Fung E. Wildenhain J. Pierce S.E. Hoon S. Lee W. Proctor M. St Onge R.P. Tyers M.

Conditionally essential (CE) genes are essential for growth in a particular condition. Deletions of such genes shows very small colony sizes and high-confidence negative scores in particular conditions (see Extended Experimental Procedures). We identified 197 CE genes, comprised of auxotrophs, which exhibit no growth in minimal media, and rich-media CE genes, which exhibit no growth in at least one rich media-based stress (Table S4). Importantly, our data set had 70% overlap with a previous study of Keio Collection auxotrophs (Figure 2C; Joyce et al., 2006Joyce A.R. Reed J.L. White A. Edwards R. Osterman A. Baba T. Mori H. Lesely S.A. Palsson B.O. Agarwalla S. Experimental and computational assessment of conditionally essential genes in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8259-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) despite significant experimental differences (e.g., growth in liquid versus solid media). Many of the remaining 30% were extremely sick but above the stringent threshold that we used to define no growth. We also identified 23 additional auxotrophs specific to alternative carbon/nitrogen sources that were not tested in the Joyce et al. study. Genes that are essential for survival in natural environments are likely to extend beyond those required for laboratory growth and could be targets for new antimicrobials (D'Elia et al., 2009D'Elia M.A. Pereira M.P. Brown E.D. Are essential genes really essential?.Trends Microbiol. 2009; 17: 433-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The 116 rich-media CE genes that we identified (Figure 2C) result from physiologically relevant stresses and increase the current number of essential genes by roughly 30%. Interestingly, many of these gene products are located in the outer cell envelope (Figure 2D), a selective permeability barrier for Gram-negative bacteria that is severely underrepresented for known essential genes (Figure 2D). Many of the stresses generating CE phenotypes are part of the natural environment of E. coli, e.g., bile salts (Table S5), indicating that these genes are likely indispensable for E. coli to survive in vivo. Similarly, using the largest metagenomic data set to date, Qin et al. reported that envelope-specific functions, such as adhesion, were commonly required for life in the gut (Qin et al., 2010Qin J. Li R. Raes J. Arumugam M. Burgdorf K.S. Manichanh C. Nielsen T. Pons N. Levenez F. Yamada T. et al.MetaHIT ConsortiumA human gut microbial gene catalogue established by metagenomic sequencing.Nature. 2010; 464: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (6160) Google Scholar). A key motivation for our study was to provide phenotypes for mutants of genes without functional annotation. Using a recently assembled compendium of such “orphan genes” in E. coli (Hu et al., 2009Hu P. Janga S.C. Babu M. Díaz-Mejía J.J. Butland G. Yang W. Pogoutse O. Guo X. Phanse S. Wong P. et al.Global functional atlas of Escherichia coli encompassing previously uncharacterized proteins.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e96Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), we find that the fraction of mutant orphan genes with phenotypes is close to that of annotated genes (Figure 3A ), but the former tend to have fewer phenotypes, indicating the power of phenomic analysis for identifying their phenotypes. Importantly, the phenotypic profiles of > 25% of all orphan genes correlate strongly with those of annotated genes (r ≥ 0.5; Figure 3B and Table S6), providing high-confidence leads (p < 10−22) for discovery of their function. As these orphans are tied to a wide variety of cellular processes (Figure 3C), the data set will be of broad utility. A small fraction of orphan gene knockouts have many phenotypes. Whereas annotated genes that are responsible for many phenotypes are broadly distributed among bacteria, the most responsive orphans tend to be narrowly distributed (Figure 3D). This result suggests that evolutionary conservation is not a reliable indicator of the importance of an orphan gene to the organism and that annotating them solely by homology has limitations. Such orphans may have evolved to fulfill an important but specialized function required by the niche of the organism. In support of this idea, a multiresponsive orphan identified in this study (lpoB) is restricted to enterobacteria and regulates peptidoglycan synthesis, a conserved process that is ubiquitous among bacteria (Typas et al., 2010Typas A. Banzhaf M. van den Berg van Saparoea B. Verheul J. Biboy J. Nichols R.J. Zietek M. Beilharz K. Kannenberg K. von Rechen"

The sequence assembly covers approximately 80% of the genome. We sequenced and assembled the draft genome of Theobroma cacao, an economically important tropical-fruit tree crop that is the source of chocolate. This assembly corresponds to 76% of the estimated genome size and contains almost all previously described genes, with 82% of these genes anchored on the 10 T. cacao chromosomes. Analysis of this sequence information highlighted specific expansion of some gene families during evolution, for example, flavonoid-related genes. It also provides a major source of candidate genes for T. cacao improvement. Based on the inferred paleohistory of the T. cacao genome, we propose an evolutionary scenario whereby the ten T. cacao chromosomes were shaped from an ancestor through eleven chromosome fusions."

HGPS affects mesenchymal lineages, including the skeletal system, dermis, and vascular smooth muscle (VSMC). To understand the underlying molecular pathology of HGPS, we derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from HGPS dermal fibroblasts. The iPSCs were differentiated into neural progenitors, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, VSMCs, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Progerin levels were highest in MSCs, VSMCs, and fibroblasts, in that order, with these lineages displaying increased DNA damage, nuclear abnormalities, and HGPS-VSMC accumulating numerous calponin-staining inclusion bodies. Both HGPS-MSC and -VSMC viability was compromised by stress and hypoxia in vitro and in vivo (MSC).

Afflicted individuals generally die in their early teens due to myocardial infarction or stroke, but it is the wizened facial features and wasted bodies that have made this harrowing condition familiar to the population at large. The disease progression displays many symptoms of normal aging, such as severe growth retardation, alopecia, loss of subcutaneous fat, and progressive atherosclerosis, although other symptoms associated with aging such as neural degeneration, diabetes, malignancies, and cataracts are absent (Ackerman and Gilbert-Barness, 2002Ackerman J.

Med. 2008; 358: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). This disease, which seems to affect mainly mesenchymal lineages, is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the LMNA gene (De Sandre-Giovannoli et al., 2003De Sandre-Giovannoli A. Bernard R.

The most common (in 80%–90% of cases) mutation is a C-T transition at position 1824 in exon 11 that creates an efficient alternative splice donor site. This leads to the production of a truncated lamin A protein (progerin) with an internal deletion of 50 amino acids in the C-terminal globular domain. As a result of this mutation, progerin, but not mature lamin A, retains a C-terminal farnesyl tail that is normally only transiently present in the Lamin A precursor. Farnesyl retention is widely thought to underlie the intracellular disruption associated with progerin, although the exact roles of the farnesyl group and the deletion in the etiology of the disease are controversial (Yang et al., 2008Yang S.H. Andres D.A. Spielmann H.P. Young S.G. Fong L.G. Progerin elicits disease phenotypes of progeria in mice whether or not it is farnesylated.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3291-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The cell type-specific pathologies in HGPS have been attributed to a variety of causes, including progerin-mediated stem cell pool exhaustion (Halaschek-Wiener and Brooks-Wilson, 2007Halaschek-Wiener J.

Genomic instability and DNA damage responses in progeria arising from defective maturation of prelamin A.Aging. 2009; 1: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and nuclear fragility in mechanically stressed cells such as cardiomyocytes (Verstraeten et al., 2008Verstraeten V.L.

Interestingly, the same aberrant splicing event may also occur at much lower levels in normal cells (Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Lamin A-dependent nuclear defects in human aging.Science. 2006; 312: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Although low progerin RNA levels may not increase with age, several reports have suggested that progerin protein levels do increase, (McClintock et al., 2007McClintock D. Ratner D. Lokuge M. Owens D.M. Gordon L.B. Collins F.S. Djabali K.

Misteli T. Lamin A-dependent nuclear defects in human aging.Science. 2006; 312: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), possibly reflecting a low turnover of the protein or an age-related inability to remove cells with high progerin loads. This has led to speculation that studies on progeria may provide insight into the normal human aging process. Due to the rarity and juvenile mortality of this disease, biopsy and autopsy analysis has been limited, although pronounced vascular smooth muscle loss and artherosclerosis appear to be critical factors contributing to the death of patients (Stehbens et al., 2001Stehbens W.E.

Much of the information relating to the pathophysiology of HGPS has come from studies on patient-derived skin fibroblasts, wild-type and mutant lamin A overexpression in established cell lines (Cao et al., 2007Cao K.

The use of mouse models has been particularly informative; however, no one mouse model recapitulates all the symptoms seen in the human disease. Recently, a number of human disease models have been established by the transcription-factor-mediated reprogramming of somatic cells taken from patients with Lou Gehrig's disease (Dimos et al., 2008Dimos J.T.

Loewer S. et al.Telomere elongation in induced pluripotent stem cells from dyskeratosis congenita patients.Nature. 2010; 464: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In all cases, the reprogrammed cells (induced pluripotent stem cells [iPSCs]) were used to derive cell types that, in vivo, display a distinctive disease phenotype. The underlying hope behind these studies is that a disease pathology will emerge in a relatively short time (compared to disease progression in vivo) and generate insight into early disease pathophysiology, as well as providing cell types for drug screening and discovery. Here, we describe an iPSC model of HGPS. iPSC lines were made from patient-derived fibroblasts and differentiated into mesenchymal and nonmesenchymal lineages to analyze the impact of progerin on the functional properties of the different cell types. We find that progerin levels are highest in mesenchymal stem cells, VSMCs, and fibroblasts, and lowest in the neural progenitors. Progerin expressing VSMCs and MSCs, but not controls, are sensitive to hypoxia, and HGPS-MSCs fail to mediate circulatory restoration in a murine hind limb recovery model. We speculate that one significant cause of progeria pathology is a shortage of MSCs needed for tissue replacement, and this shortage is exacerbated by a loss of specific differentiated types due to progerin. Our experiments support the hypothesis that the MSC pool becomes exhausted due to replicative overload in HGPS patients (Halaschek-Wiener and Brooks-Wilson, 2007Halaschek-Wiener J. Brooks-Wilson A. Progeria of stem cells: stem cell exhaustion in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2007; 62: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), which is compounded by a parallel depletion due to progerin-induced sensitivity of the stem cells to their niche conditions. Skin-derived fibroblast cultures from two HGPS patients (AG11498 [PG1], AG06297 [PG2]) and two HGPS parents (AG03512 [N1], AG06299 [N2]) were obtained from the Coriell Institute. Both patient genomes contain the typical C-T mutation of LMNA gene at position 1824 of exon 11. The mutant protein, progerin, was detected exclusively in HGPS fibroblasts by western analysis and immunofluorescence using a progerin-specific antibody (Figure 1). Nuclear membrane deformation “blebbing” was seen in approximately 20%–30% HGPS fibroblasts at p15-20, in contrast to 3%–11% in normal fibroblast cells at similar passage. This increased to 60%–70% in HGPS fibroblasts by p25-30, with more modest increases seen in the control fibroblasts. PG1, PG2, and N2 fibroblasts displayed normal karyotypes. However, in N1 fibroblasts, 55% of cells had an abnormal karyotype with trisomy 7. We reprogrammed the four fibroblast lines by retrovirus infection of cells at p15-20 using the “Yamanaka” factor cocktail: OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and C-MYC. Infected fibroblasts were cultured on a murine feeder layer with 0.5 mM valproic acid in human ESC medium. iPSC colonies were observed at 2 to 3 weeks and picked between 3 to 4 weeks. Though the efficiency of reprogramming of HGPS fibroblasts was 4-fold lower than parental control fibroblasts (Figure 1C), all the colonies picked were expanded and displayed morphologies indistinguishable from human ESCs (Figure 1D): no colonies were obtained from the two HGPS fibroblast cultures at late passage (p26). We attribute this failure to the onset of senescence observed in these cultures beginning at p22 since efficient iPSC generation is associated with a cell's proliferative potential (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Saha K. Pando B. van Zon J. Lengner C.J. Creyghton M.P. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R. Direct cell reprogramming is a stochastic process amenable to acceleration.Nature. 2009; 462: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Five to ten colonies were picked to represent each patient or control, and for the N1-iPSC, about 50% of the colonies displayed a normal karyotype. Exogenous expression of the four reprogramming factors was screened for by RT-PCR in all the iPSC clones. No transgenic transcripts were found in any clone (Figure S1A available online). Two clones from each patient or control (given the suffix iPSC-1 or iPSC-2) each with a normal karyotype (Figure S1B) were selected for further characterization. DNA sequencing revealed HGPS-iPSC but no control clones had the C-T mutation of the LMNA gene (Figure S1C). All clones express the pluripotent markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, SSEA4, and TRA1-80, as determined by immunocytochemistry (Figure 1D). In addition, all iPSC lines showed reactivation of three endogenous pluripotency-related genes with similar level of expression as seen in hESCs (Figure S2A). As expected for hiPSCs, the OCT4 promoter region in all iPSCs (and hESC3) was hypomethylated in contrast to its hypermethylated state in the parental fibroblasts (Figure S2B). To test the pluripotency of iPSCs, teratoma assays were performed in SCID mice. All the clones developed teratomas comprised of tissues from all three germ layers (Figure S2C). The transcriptomes of two independently derived sister clones from each hiPSC genotype were compared to that in two different hESC lines (hESC3 and H9) by microarray analysis on 24,000 gene Illumina chips. Clustering analysis revealed a high degree of similarity (r = 0.99) between the reprogrammed HGPS-iPSCs (PG1-iPSCs, PG2-iPSCs) and parental control iPSC (N1-iPSCs, N2-iPSCs) that clustered with the hESC group (r = 0.99). The three groups were distant from the HGPS and control fibroblasts (r = 0.82) (Figure 1E, Table S1). The above data indicate that, despite the presence of progerin in the nucleus, somatic cells from HGPS patients can be reprogrammed into iPSCs with characteristics that are highly similar to embryo-derived human ESCs. Lamins A and C are transcribed from the same promoter and share the first 566 amino acids. Undifferentiated mESCs and hESCs do not express LMNA transcripts (Constantinescu et al., 2006Constantinescu D. Gray H.L. Sammak P.J. Schatten G.P. Csoka A.B. Lamin A/C expression is a marker of mouse and human embryonic stem cell differentiation.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent analysis of the iPSC colonies revealed that LMNA proteins were expressed in differentiated cells at the edge of the colony, whereas the bulk of the colony stained for the pluripotent marker SOX2 (Figure 2A ). No specific staining for progerin was detected in any region. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed the presence of LMNA transcripts but showed progerin transcripts present at lower levels. Colony dissection indicated that the majority of these transcripts were at the rim of the colonies (Figure 2B). In addition, RNA levels of LMNA and progerin expression in intact HGPS-iPSC colonies were less than 10% of those present in fibroblasts (Figure 3A ). These data demonstrate that LMNA expression in patient and control fibroblasts was suppressed by reprogramming.Figure 3Lamin A/C Expression in iPSC-Derived Fibroblasts, Endothelial Cells, Neural Progenitor Cells, VSMCs, and MSCsShow full caption(A) Relative Lamin A and progerin expression in iPSC differentiated samples by RT-PCR using Taqman probes.

Clinical and autopsy data indicate that in HGPS, the main lineages affected are mesenchymal in origin with neural lineages seemingly unaffected (McClintock et al., 2006McClintock D. Gordon L.B. Djabali K. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria mutant lamin A primarily targets human vascular cells as detected by an anti-Lamin A G608G antibody.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Since tissue samples from HGPS patients are extremely rare, we used existing or modified protocols to derive MSC, neural, and other candidate lineages for further examination. Differentiation of the HGPS-iPSC clones always resulted in expression of lamins A, C, and progerin. We quantified lamin A and C expression by both western and real-time RT-PCR analysis (Figures 3A and 3B). Progerin levels were highest in iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), followed by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), fibroblast, and endothelial cells, in that order. Neural progenitors consistently showed the lowest levels. Interestingly, we observed a 3- to 5-fold increase in progerin levels over prolonged culture for iPSC-MSCs (Figure 3C), whereas in only one of the two HGPS-iPSC fibroblast lines was an increase noted (data not shown). A similar inconsistency in progerin accumulation, with passage number in patient fibroblasts, was previously reported (Goldman et al., 2004Goldman R.D. Shumaker D.K. Erdos M.R. Eriksson M.

Overall, our observations are consistent with skin biopsy data in finding significant presence of progerin in endothelial and fibroblast lineages. Extended culture of HGPS and control fibroblasts revealed an accumulation of abnormal nuclear morphologies (Bridger and Kill, 2004Bridger J.M. Kill I.R. Aging of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome fibroblasts is characterised by hyperproliferation and increased apoptosis.Exp. Gerontol. 2004; 39: 717-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We obtained fibroblasts by FACS sorting of Thy1+ cells formed during differentiation of the iPSC lines. The purified cells expressed prolyl 4-hydroxylase and displayed a similar surface marker profile to parental fibroblasts—high in CD29, CD44, and CD90 (Thy1) and low in CD106 (Figure 4A and Figure S3A). As with the HGPS-iPSC fibroblasts, we found increased nuclear dysmorphology, DNA damage (% nuclei with 3 or more foci staining for γ-H2AX), and mislocalization of the nuclear protein, LAP2, in progerin-expressing lines (Figure 4A). Progerin accumulation was heterogeneous in the HGPS populations, and loss of LAP2 from the nuclei was more apparent in nuclei displaying higher progerin levels and more pronounced dysmorphology (Figure 4A, arrows). These results are similar to those for HGPS patient fibroblasts after extended culture (Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Lamin A-dependent nuclear defects in human aging.Science. 2006; 312: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Neither increased DNA-damage foci nor nuclear dysmorphologies were observed in iPSC-derived neural progenitors and endothelial cells (Figures 4B and 4C). Neural progenitors were propagated by neurosphere culture and characterized by nestin, vimentin, and Ki67 staining (Figure 4B). Endothelial cultures were CD31+ve/CD43−ve, stained for VE-cadherin (Figure 4C) and were also positive for CD31, VE-cadherin, C-KIT, and KDR transcripts (Figure S3B). Neural progenitors made from different hESC or iPSC lines at passages 7–10 were differentiated mainly into Tuj-1+ve neurons (Figure 4B), although some GFAP-staining glial cells were detected (data not shown). No differences were observed between HGPS and normal neurospheres in growth or neuronal differentiation. Both HGPS and control iPSC-derived endothelial cells formed lattice-like vessel structures on Matrigel (Figure 4C), a characteristic feature of endothelial cells. HGPS-iPSC endothelial cells also displayed a normal lipid uptake function (Figure 4C). MSCs were prepared from iPSC-derived EBs and were characterized by FACS analysis as negative or low for the surface markers of CD24, CD31, and CD34 and positive for CD29, CD44, CD73, CD105, and CD166 (Figure S3C). Cluster analysis of microarray data indicated that the iPSC-MSCs were more closely related to hESC-derived and fetal bone marrow-derived MSCs than adult bone marrow MSCs (Figure S3D). MSCs differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages in vitro when provided with appropriate growth conditions. All three lineages were formed from all the HGPS- and control-iPSC-MSC lines (Figures 4D and 4E). Under extended culture, the HGPS-MSCs showed considerable nuclear lobulation that correlated with increasing levels of progerin. The high percentage of nuclear malformation was accompanied by mislocalization of LAP2 (Figure 4F). A significant increase in nuclei-containing DNA damage foci was also observed in late passage HGPS-MSCs (Figure 4F). VSMC were obtained from iPSC derived MSCs by treatment with a combination of SPC and TGFβ1 (Jeon et al., 2006Jeon E.S. Moon H.J. Lee M.J. Song H.Y. Kim Y.M. Bae Y.C. Jung J.S. Kim J.H.

After 3 weeks of induction, 50%–60% cells showed specific VSMC marker expression of α-smooth muscle actin, calponin 1, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (Figure 5A ) with the VSMC lineage marker transcripts being confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 5B). The VSMCs displayed a characteristic spindle-like morphology and were induced to contract by carbachol administration (Figure 5C), supporting their VSMC identity. Like fibroblasts and MSCs, the HGPS-VSMCs displayed nuclear deformations, LAP2 mislocalization, and increased DNA damage on culture (Figure 5D).

We report a genome-wide association study for glycemic response to metformin in 1,024 Scottish individuals with type 2 diabetes with replication in two cohorts including 1,783 Scottish individuals and 1,113 individuals from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study. In a combined meta-analysis, we identified a SNP, rs11212617, associated with treatment success (n = 3,920, P = 2.9 × 10−9, odds ratio = 1.35, 95% CI 1.22–1.49) at a locus containing ATM, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene. In a rat hepatoma cell line, inhibition of ATM with KU-55933 attenuated the phosphorylation and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase in response to metformin. We conclude that ATM, a gene known to be involved in DNA repair and cell cycle control, plays a role in the effect of metformin upstream of AMP-activated protein kinase, and variation in this gene alters glycemic response to metformin."
https://openalex.org/W2145246556,"Johan Paulsson and Dann Huh report a mathematical modeling analysis proposing that stochastic partitioning errors during cell division contribute to non-genetic heterogeneity between cells in a population. They find that fluctuations arising from such partitioning errors are difficult to suppress and can mimic noise in gene expression. Gene expression involves inherently probabilistic steps that create fluctuations in protein abundances. The results from many in-depth analyses and genome-scale surveys have suggested how such fluctuations arise and spread, often in ways consistent with stochastic models of transcription and translation. But fluctuations also arise during cell division when molecules are partitioned stochastically between the two daughters. Here we mathematically demonstrate how stochastic partitioning contributes to the non-genetic heterogeneity. Our results show that partitioning errors are hard to correct, and that the resulting noise profiles are remarkably difficult to separate from gene expression noise. By applying these results to common experimental strategies and distinguishing between creation versus transmission of noise, we hypothesize that much of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity that has been attributed to various aspects of gene expression instead comes from random segregation at cell division. We propose experiments to separate between these two types of fluctuations and discuss future directions."
https://openalex.org/W2061428578,"The systemic regulation of stem cells ensures that they meet the needs of the organism during growth and in response to injury. A key point of regulation is the decision between quiescence and proliferation. During development, Drosophila neural stem cells (neuroblasts) transit through a period of quiescence separating distinct embryonic and postembryonic phases of proliferation. It is known that neuroblasts exit quiescence via a hitherto unknown pathway in response to a nutrition-dependent signal from the fat body. We have identified a population of glial cells that produce insulin/IGF-like peptides in response to nutrition, and we show that the insulin/IGF receptor pathway is necessary for neuroblasts to exit quiescence. The forced expression of insulin/IGF-like peptides in glia, or activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in neuroblasts, can drive neuroblast growth and proliferation in the absence of dietary protein and thus uncouple neuroblasts from systemic control."

https://openalex.org/W2129482408,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are conventionally classified as toxic consequences of aerobic life, and the brain is particularly susceptible to ROS-induced oxidative stress and damage owing to its high energy and oxygen demands. NADPH oxidases (Nox) are a widespread source of brain ROS implicated in seizures, stroke and neurodegeneration. A physiological role for ROS generation in normal brain function has not been established, despite the fact that mice and humans lacking functional Nox proteins have cognitive deficits. Using molecular imaging with Peroxyfluor-6 (PF6), a new selective fluorescent indicator for hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), we show that adult hippocampal stem/progenitor cells (AHPs) generate H(2)O(2) through Nox2 to regulate intracellular growth signaling pathways, which in turn maintains their normal proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Our results challenge the traditional view that brain ROS are solely deleterious by demonstrating that controlled ROS chemistry is needed for maintaining specific cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2078377283,"In both Drosophila and mammalian systems, the Hippo pathway plays an important role in controlling organ size, mainly through its ability to regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis. The key component in the Hippo pathway is the Yes-associated protein YAP1, which localizes in nucleus, functions as a transcriptional coactivator, and regulates the expression of several proliferation- and apoptosis-related genes. The Hippo pathway negatively regulates YAP1 transcriptional activity by modulating its nuclear-cytoplasmic localization in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Here, we describe the identification of several new PY motif-containing proteins, including angiomotin-like protein 1 (AMOTL1) and 2 (AMOTL2), as YAP1-associated proteins. We demonstrate that AMOTL1 and AMOTL2 can regulate YAP1 cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation through direct protein-protein interaction, which can occur independent of YAP1 phosphorylation status. Moreover, down-regulation of AMOTL2 in MCF10A cells promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a phenotype that is also observed in MCF10A cells with YAP1 overexpression. Together, these data support a new mechanism for YAP1 regulation, which is mediated via its direct interactions with angiomotin-like proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2139653729,"It is well established that the auxiliary Cavβ subunit regulates calcium channel density in the plasma membrane, but the cellular mechanism by which this occurs has remained unclear. We found that the Cavβ subunit increased membrane expression of Cav1.2 channels by preventing the entry of the channels into the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) complex. Without Cavβ, Cav1.2 channels underwent robust ubiquitination by the RFP2 ubiquitin ligase and interacted with the ERAD complex proteins derlin-1 and p97, culminating in targeting of the channels to the proteasome for degradation. On treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, Cavβ-free channels were rescued from degradation and trafficked to the plasma membrane. The coexpression of Cavβ interfered with ubiquitination and targeting of the channel to the ERAD complex, thereby facilitating export from the endoplasmic reticulum and promoting expression on the cell surface. Thus, Cavββ regulates the ubiquitination and stability of the calcium channel complex."

https://openalex.org/W1985336161,"Glucocorticoids play important roles in the regulation of distinct aspects of adipocyte biology. Excess glucocorticoids in adipocytes are associated with metabolic disorders, including central obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. To understand the mechanisms underlying the glucocorticoid action in adipocytes, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to isolate genome-wide glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding regions (GBRs) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, gene expression analyses were used to identify genes that were regulated by glucocorticoids. Overall, 274 glucocorticoid-regulated genes contain or locate nearby GBR. We found that many GBRs were located in or nearby genes involved in triglyceride (TG) synthesis (Scd-1, 2, 3, GPAT3, GPAT4, Agpat2, Lpin1), lipolysis (Lipe, Mgll), lipid transport (Cd36, Lrp-1, Vldlr, Slc27a2) and storage (S3-12). Gene expression analysis showed that except for Scd-3, the other 13 genes were induced in mouse inguinal fat upon 4-day glucocorticoid treatment. Reporter gene assays showed that except Agpat2, the other 12 glucocorticoid-regulated genes contain at least one GBR that can mediate hormone response. In agreement with the fact that glucocorticoids activated genes in both TG biosynthetic and lipolytic pathways, we confirmed that 4-day glucocorticoid treatment increased TG synthesis and lipolysis concomitantly in inguinal fat. Notably, we found that 9 of these 12 genes were induced in transgenic mice that have constant elevated plasma glucocorticoid levels. These results suggested that a similar mechanism was used to regulate TG homeostasis during chronic glucocorticoid treatment. In summary, our studies have identified molecular components in a glucocorticoid-controlled gene network involved in the regulation of TG homeostasis in adipocytes. Understanding the regulation of this gene network should provide important insight for future therapeutic developments for metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2080815080,"Canalization, also known as developmental robustness, describes an organism's ability to produce the same phenotype despite genotypic variations and environmental influences. In Drosophila, Hsp90, the trithorax-group proteins and transposon silencing have been previously implicated in canalization. Despite this, the molecular mechanism underlying canalization remains elusive. Here using a Drosophila eye-outgrowth assay sensitized by the dominant Kr(irregular facets-1)(Kr(If-1)) allele, we show that the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, but not the short interfering RNA or micro RNA pathway, is involved in canalization. Furthermore, we isolated a protein complex composed of Hsp90, Piwi and Hop, the Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein homolog, and we demonstrated the function of this complex in canalization. Our data indicate that Hsp90 and Hop regulate the piRNA pathway through Piwi to mediate canalization. Moreover, they point to epigenetic silencing of the expression of existing genetic variants and the suppression of transposon-induced new genetic variation as two major mechanisms underlying piRNA pathway-mediated canalization."

We investigated the role of octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of adrenaline and noradrenaline, in synaptic and behavioral plasticity in Drosophila. We found that an increase in locomotor speed induced by food deprivation was accompanied by an activity- and octopamine-dependent extension of octopaminergic arbors and that the formation and maintenance of these arbors required electrical activity. Growth of octopaminergic arbors was controlled by a cAMP- and CREB-dependent positive-feedback mechanism that required Octβ2R octopamine autoreceptors. Notably, this autoregulation was necessary for the locomotor response. In addition, octopamine neurons regulated the expansion of excitatory glutamatergic neuromuscular arbors through Octβ2Rs on glutamatergic motor neurons. Our results provide a mechanism for global regulation of excitatory synapses, presumably to maintain synaptic and behavioral plasticity in a dynamic range."
https://openalex.org/W2108974337,"Shear stress is a ubiquitous environmental cue experienced by stem cells when they are being differentiated or expanded in perfusion cultures. However, its role in modulating self-renewing stem cell phenotypes is unclear, since shear is usually only studied in the context of cardiovascular differentiation. We used a multiplex microfluidic array, which overcomes the limitations of macroperfusion systems in shear application throughput and precision, to initiate a comprehensive, quantitative study of shear effects on self-renewing mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), where shear stresses varying by >1000 times (0.016-16 dyn/cm(2)) are applied simultaneously. When compared with static controls in the presence or absence of a saturated soluble environment (i.e., mESC-conditioned medium), we ascertained that flow-induced shear stress specifically up-regulates the epiblast marker Fgf5. Epiblast-state transition in mESCs involves heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which have also been shown to transduce shear stress in endothelial cells. By disrupting (with sulfation inhibitors and heparinase) and partially reconstituting (with heparin) HSPG function, we show that mESCs also mechanically sense shear stress via HSPGs to modulate Fgf5 expression. This study demonstrates that self-renewing mESCs possess the molecular machinery to sense shear stress and provides quantitative shear application benchmarks for future scalable stem cell culture systems."

Using RNA binding and polymerase activity assays, we defined two elements of the SLA that are involved in polymerase interaction and RNA synthesis. Mutations at the top of the SLA resulted in RNAs that retained the ability to bind the polymerase but impaired promoter-dependent RNA synthesis. These results indicate that protein binding to the SLA is not sufficient to induce polymerase activity and that specific nucleotides of the SLA are necessary to render an active polymerase-promoter complex for RNA synthesis. We also report that protein binding to the viral RNA induces conformational changes downstream of the promoter element. Furthermore, we found that structured RNA elements at the 3′ end of the template repress dengue virus polymerase activity in the context of a fully active SLA promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2012325184,"Post-translational histone modifications play important roles in regulating gene expression programs, which in turn determine cell fate and lineage commitment during development. One such modification is histone ubiquitination, which primarily targets histone H2A and H2B. Although ubiquitination of H2A and H2B has been generally linked to gene silencing and gene activation, respectively, the functions of histone ubiquitination during eukaryote development are not well understood. Here, we identified USP12 and USP46 as histone H2A and H2B deubiquitinases that regulate Xenopus development. USP12 and USP46 prefer nucleosomal substrates and deubiquitinate both histone H2A and H2B in vitro and in vivo. WDR48, a WD40 repeat-containing protein, interacts with USP12 and USP46 and is required for the histone deubiquitination activity. Overexpression of either gene leads to gastrulation defects without affecting mesodermal cell fate, whereas knockdown of USP12 in Xenopus embryos results in reduction of a subset of mesodermal genes at gastrula stages. Immunohistochemical staining and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that USP12 regulates histone deubiquitination in the mesoderm and at specific gene promoters during Xenopus development. Taken together, this study identifies USP12 and USP46 as histone deubiquitinases for H2A and H2B and reveals that USP12 regulates Xenopus development during gastrula stages."
https://openalex.org/W2110945179,"The mechanisms used by the immune system to discriminate between pathogenic and commensal bacteria have remained largely unclear. Recently, we have shown that virulence of Staphylococcus aureus depends on secretion of phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) peptides that disrupt neutrophils at micromolar concentrations. Moreover, all S. aureus PSMs stimulate and attract neutrophils at nanomolar concentrations via interaction with the formyl-peptide receptor 2 (FPR2). Here, we demonstrate that FPR2 allows neutrophils to adjust their responses in relation to the aggressiveness of staphylococcal species, which differ largely in their capacity to infect or colonize humans and animals. PSM-related peptides were detected in all human and animal pathogenic staphylococci, but were absent from most commensal species. Three PSMβ-like peptides produced by the serious human pathogen Staphylococcus lugdunensis were identified as the previously described S. lugdunensis-synergistic hemolysins (SLUSHs). SLUSHs attracted and stimulated human leukocytes in a FPR2-dependent manner, indicating that FPR2 is a general receptor for all PSM-like peptide toxins. Remarkably, the release of PSMs correlated closely with the apparent capacity of staphylococcal species to cause invasive infections and with their ability to activate FPR2. These findings suggest that the innate immune system may be able to respond in different ways to pathogenic or innocuous staphylococci by monitoring the presence of PSMs via FPR2.—Rautenberg, M., Joo, H.

https://openalex.org/W2010203380,"Human telomeres are composed of duplex TTAGGG repeats and a 3' single-stranded DNA tail. The telomeric DNA is protected and regulated by the shelterin proteins, including the protection of telomeres 1 (POT1) protein that binds telomeric single-stranded DNA. The single-stranded tail can fold into G-quadruplex (G4) DNA. Both POT1 and G4 DNA play important roles in regulating telomere length homeostasis. To date, most studies have focused on individual quadruplexes formed by four TTAGGG repeats. Telomeric tails in human cells have on average six times as many repeats, and no structural studies have examined POT1 binding in competition with G4 DNA folding. Using single molecule atomic force microscopy imaging, we observed that the majority of the telomeric tails of 16 repeats formed two quadruplexes even though four were possible. The result that physiological telomeric tails rarely form the maximum potential number of G4 units provides a structural basis for the coexistence of G4 and POT1 on the same DNA molecule, which is observed directly in the captured atomic force microscopy images. We further observed that POT1 is significantly more effective in disrupting quadruplex DNA on long telomeric tails than an antisense oligonucleotide, indicating a novel POT1 activity beyond simply preventing quadruplex folding."

By examining the response of cells expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to a diverse selection of chemotherapeutics, we could generate a functional shRNA signature that was able to accurately group drugs into established biochemical modes of action. This, in turn, provided a diversely sampled reference set for high-resolution prediction of mechanisms of action for poorly characterized small molecules. We could further reduce the predictive shRNA target set to as few as eight genes and, by using a newly derived probability-based nearest-neighbors approach, could extend the predictive power of this shRNA set to characterize additional drug categories.

In addition to sensing multivalent cations including Ca2+ and Mg2+, the CaR is modulated by various l-amino acids (review: Ref. 1Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Trends Pharm. Sci. 2000; 21: 401-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on chimeric receptor and mutational analyses, l-amino acids bind in the receptor N-terminal Venus Fly Trap (VFT) domain (14Mun H.C. Franks A.H. Culverston E.L. Krapcho K. Nemeth E.F.

Comparative molecular modeling of the mGlu-1 and CaR VFT domain ligand binding surfaces indicates that, whereas the amino acid side-chain binding region is tightly defined by a cluster of positively charged residues in mGlu-1 and other mGlus (16Kunishima N.

Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 2032-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The larger side-chain binding surfaces in this subgroup of receptors appear to explain, at least in part, their notable promiscuity for various sub-classes of amino acids (reviews: Refs. 19Conigrave A.D. Hampson D.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 398-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 20Wellendorph P. Bräuner-Osborne H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 156: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and has led to the successful prediction that small peptides that retain α-amino and α-carboxylate functional groups at their N termini, including the tri-peptide glutathione would bind and activate the CaR expressed in HEK-293 cells (21Wang M. Yao Y. Kuang D. Hampson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8864-8870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Building on this observation, γ-glutamyl peptides were recently found to be potent taste enhancers (22Ohsu T. Amino Y. Nagasaki H. Yamanaka T. Takeshita S. Hatanaka T. Maruyama Y. Miyamura N. Eto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1016-1022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) raising the possibility that they may be physiologically important receptor modulators in various tissues in which the CaR is expressed. To further evaluate the physiological significance of these observations we have now tested the effects of the γ-glutamyl-tripeptides γ-Glu-Cys-Gly (glutathione), S-methylglutathione and S-propylglutathione, and dipeptides γ-Glu-Ala and γ-Glu-Cys, on extracellular Cao2+-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and suppression of cAMP levels in CaR-expressing HEK-293 cells. We then extended the investigation to consider the effects of these peptides on intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and PTH secretion in normal human parathyroid cells, and whether a double mutant T145A/S170T that selectively impairs amino acid-dependent activation of the CaR (15Mun H.C. Culverston E.L. Franks A.H. Collyer C.A. Clifton-Bligh R.J. Conigrave A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29067-29072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) might also impair the actions of γ-glutamyl peptides. The results indicate that various γ-glutamyl peptides including glutathione and its metabolite S-methylglutathione are potent positive allosteric modulators of the CaR that promote Ca2+i mobilization and lower intracellular cAMP levels in CaR-expressing HEK-293 cells and promote Ca2+i mobilization and suppress PTH secretion in normal human parathyroid cells. Results of a comparative analysis of HEK-293 cells that express either the wild-type or double mutant T145A/S170T CaR indicate that, distinct from Cao2+ and phenylalkylamines, γ-glutamyl peptides and l-amino acids modulate the receptor via a common mechanism linking binding of l-amino acids or γ-glutamyl peptides at closely related sites in the VFT domain to a characteristic change in receptor conformation that couples to the modulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and cAMP levels. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells stably expressing the CaR (HEK-CaR cells), untransfected HEK-293 cells, and HEK-293 cells that stably expressed a double mutant form of the CaR (HEK-CaR-T145A/S170T cells) were thawed from frozen stocks and cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen)/10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (15Mun H.C.

In general, cultured cells were studied between passage numbers 4 and 20. For microfluorimetry experiments, HEK-293 cells were transferred onto sterilized 15-mm diameter coverslips in 24-well plates and cultured for a further 24–48 h. Samples from normal human parathyroid auto-transplants were obtained during thyroid surgery at the Royal North Shore Hospital and North Shore Private Hospital, St Leonards, New South Wales and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, North Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. All procedures were performed under guidelines established by the relevant human research ethics committees, and all patients provided written informed consent for the use of the tissue for experimental purposes. Parathyroid tissue was transported to the laboratory in MEM that contained 1.25 mm CaCl2. Upon arrival in the laboratory, it was either used immediately or, more typically, stored overnight in MEM at 4 °C as described previously (23Conigrave A.D. Mun H.C. Delbridge L. Quinn S.J. Wilkinson M. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38151-38159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Prior to collagenase digestion, parathyroid tissue retains viability under these conditions (24Brown E.M. Hurwitz S. Aurbach G.D. Endocrinology. 1976; 99: 1582-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). For digestion, it was transferred to MEM that contained 1 mg/ml collagenase and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I. After brief oxygenation it was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The enzyme suspension was then decanted and the parathyroid tissue was transferred into 5 ml of MEM that contained 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The tissue was then subjected to trituration (10–15 times) through the tip of a disposable 5-ml syringe (no needle attached). The cloudy suspension containing clumped parathyroid cells was then passed through a 200-μm pore size nylon filter, sedimented (70 × g, 2.5 min), and the cell pellet gently resuspended then washed twice with 5 ml of BSA-containing MEM. It was finally resuspended in 2 ml of bovine serum albumin-containing MEM. Remaining pieces of undigested parathyroid tissue were then incubated for a further 20 min at 37 °C in fresh medium containing collagenase and DNase I. The enzyme suspension was once more decanted, and the parathyroid tissue subjected to trituration and centrifugal isolation as above. Stock amino acid-containing solutions were routinely made up in physiological saline at 50 or 100 mm and stored at −20 °C then diluted in amino acid-free physiological saline as required. Di-peptide and tri-peptide containing solutions, on the other hand, were made up fresh in physiological saline and used on the day of experiment. The control physiological saline solution (PSS) used in all microfluorimetry experiments had the following composition: 125 mm NaCl, 4.0 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (NaOH), 0.1% d-glucose (pH 7.4). HEK-293 cells that had been cultured on coverslips in 24-well plates were loaded with 5 μm fura2-AM in PSS that contained 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 2 h in the dark. This solution was then removed and replaced by fresh albumin-containing PSS and the cells were incubated for a further 30 min to promote the conversion of fura-2 to its fully ionized, Ca2+-binding form. Suspensions of normal human parathyroid cells, which had been prepared by collagenase digestion, were loaded with 1 μm fura-2 AM for 20 min at 37 °C in MEM containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). The cells were sedimented (70 × g, 2.5 min) and then resuspended in albumin-free physiological saline solution. Fura-2-loaded HEK-293 cells that had been cultured on coverslips or fura-2 loaded parathyroid cells, which readily attach to glass surfaces, were transferred into a superfusion chamber, placed in the light path of a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope (63× objective) and perifused with inorganic phosphate-free physiological saline solutions that were modified to contain various concentrations of Cao2+, l-Phe, and γ-glutamyl di- and tri-peptides. A Lambda DG-4 150 watt Xenon light source (Sutter) was programmed to alternate between two excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm) at a frequency of 1 s−1. Areas of interest were selected and digital images were then captured and downloaded using a high resolution AxioCam camera controlled by Stallion SB.4.1.0 PC software (Zeiss, Australia). Fura-2-loaded cells were imaged at 510 nm. For concentration-response analysis, fura-2 ratio data were integrated and then either plotted directly or expressed as a ratio of a control response (e.g. l-Phe or R-467). HEK-CaR, HEK-CaR-T145A/S170T, or control HEK-293 cells were seeded onto 15-mm coverslips in 24-well plates for 24 h and then transfected for 48 h with pcDNA3.1 containing the cAMP bio-sensor CFPnd-EPac1-cpVenus (EPac1; the generous gift of Dr Kees Jalink, Netherlands Cancer Institute) using Lipofectamine-2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The media were replaced with PSS containing 0.5 mm Ca2+ for 30 min at 37 °C, and coverslips were then transferred to a chamber placed in the light path of a Zeiss Axiovert epi-fluorescence microscope (63× objective) and perifused with PSS that contained various concentrations of Cao2+, l-Phe, γ-glutamyl di- or tri-peptides, or the type-II calcimimetic NPS R-467 as required. Epac1-transfected cells were excited continuously with light centered on a wavelength of 436 nm using the Lambda DG-4 light source and emitted light corresponding to CFP and Venus YFP emissions were sampled at 1s intervals using filters centered on 488 nm (CFP) and 528 nm (Venus-YFP) to permit the detection of cAMP-dependent changes in FRET. Cells of interest were selected and digital images were captured and downloaded as described above. The ratios of the fluorescence readings at 488 nm and 528 nm were plotted as a function of time after correcting for background in the absence of cells. Perifusion of normal human parathyroid cells was undertaken in low molecular mass (4–5 kDa) cut-off gel filtration micro beads so that intact PTH (∼9 kDa) would appear in the void volume as described previously (23Conigrave A.D. Mun H.C. Delbridge L. Quinn S.J. Wilkinson M. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38151-38159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Mun H.C. Brennan S.C. Delbridge L.

Gel filtration media were pre-equilibrated with physiological saline: 125 mm NaCl, 4.0 mm KCl, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm HEPES (NaOH), 0.1% d-glucose (pH 7.4) that contained 1× basal amino acid mixture (total concentration 2.8 mm; (26Conigrave A.D. Quinn S.J. Brown E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 4814-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar)), and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Around 40,000–50,000 cells were loaded onto the surface of a 0.4-ml bed volume of Bio-gel P-4 (nominal exclusion limit 4 kDa) and then gently covered with a 0.4-ml bead volume of Sephadex G-25 (nominal exclusion limit 5 kDa) in a small perifusion column. Tubing connections were then established downstream to a peristaltic pump and up-stream to a reservoir and the column was suspended in a water bath (37 °C) and perifused at 1.5 ml/min with 37 °C equilibrated control physiological saline that contained the 1-fold l-amino acid mixture and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Routinely, 2-min (i.e. 3 ml) samples were collected into tubes immersed in an ice bath and then transferred to dry ice. As required, solutions were changed to permit variations in the concentrations of Cao2+, amino acids or γ-glutamyl peptides. All samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis of intact human PTH using an Immulite 2000 autoanalyzer. For estimates of steady-state levels of PTH secretion, the first 2-min samples of all treatment periods, during which the cells were re-equilibrating, were routinely ignored and the means of the second and third samples were used for plotting the concentration-response relationships and curve-fit analysis. Microfluorimetry experiments yielded single cell data-sets consisting of fluorescence excitation ratios (F340/F380) and the corresponding times (s) since the start of the experiment. The fluorescence ratio data were integrated and the baseline responses corresponding to an initial control period were subtracted to yield activator- and concentration-dependent receptor-response values. The resulting data were plotted unmodified or expressed as ratios of control responses. For γ-glutamyl peptide responses, either 10 mm l-Phe or 5 μm NPS R-467 were used as controls. Experimental data were plotted using DeltaGraph 5.0 or GraphPad Prism 5.0b and curve-fitting was performed using the Hill equation: r = b + (a-b) Cn/(en+Cn) where r = response, a = maximum response, b = basal response, C = extracellular Ca2+ concentration (in mm), e = EC50 (the Cao2+ concentration that induced a half-maximal response) and n = Hill coefficient. PTH secretion data were fitted to the following equation: S = a − (a−b) Cn/(in+Cn) where S = secretory response, a = maximum secretory response, b = basal secretory response, C = extracellular Ca2+ concentration (in mm), i = IC50 (the Cao2+ concentration that yielded half-maximal inhibition) and n = Hill coefficient. The data were expressed routinely as means ± S.E. (number of experiments). Statistical comparisons between treatments within PTH secretion data sets were performed using Student's paired t test (two-tailed) in SPSS Statistics 17.0. Statistical comparisons between the effects of positive allosteric modulators on pEC50 values, maximum responses, or specific data points in Cao2+ concentration-response curves were performed using Student's unpaired t test (two-tailed) in SPSS. Statistically significant comparisons were accepted at p < 0.05. No effects of γ-glutamyl peptides were observed in untransfected HEK-293 cells (not shown). At extracellular Ca2+ (Cao2+) concentrations below 1.0 mm, the amino acid l-Phe (10 mm) and the tripeptide glutathione and two analogs S-methylglutathione and γ-Glu-Ala had no effect on intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) mobilization in HEK-CaR cells. For example, in the presence of 0.5 mm Cao2+, none of the peptides was effective at concentrations up to 100 μm (not shown). At Cao2+ concentrations above 1.0 mm, however, l-Phe and glutathione acutely and reversibly stimulated oscillations in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in HEK-CaR cells and a Cao2+ concentration of 2.5 mm was selected for experiments comparing the efficacies and potencies of γ-glutamyl peptides including the dipeptides γ-Glu-Ala and γ-Glu-Cys, and tripeptides, glutathione and S-methylglutathione (Fig. 1A and Table 1).TABLE 1Potencies of γ-glutamyl peptides for Cai2+ mobilization in CaR-expressing HEK-293 cellsγ-Glutamyl peptideEC50 for peptideμmS-Methylglutathione1.7 ± 0.5 (n = 4)Glutathione3.9 ± 0.7 (n = 4)γ-Glu-Cys4.7 ± 0.9 (n = 3)γ-Glu-Ala4.8 ± 0.7 (n = 3) Open table in a new tab All four γ-glutamyl peptides were effective positive allosteric modulators of Cai2+ mobilization in the presence of 2.5 mm Ca2+. The order of potency for Cai2+ mobilization was as follows (at Cao2+ = 2.5 mm; Fig. 1, B and C and Table 1): S-methylglutathione > glutathione > γ-Glu-Ala > l-Phe. In separate experiments, similar potencies were observed for γ-Glu-Cys and γ-Glu-Ala (Table 1). Co-administration of the recognized CaR-active amino acid, l-Phe and high potency γ-glutamyl peptide S-methylglutathione, at maximal concentrations i.e. 10 mm and 10 μm respectively, induced no additional effect when compared with either l-Phe or S-methylglutathione alone (not shown). On the other hand, at a Cao2+ concentration of 2.5 mm, maximally effective concentrations of S-methylglutathione and NPS R-467 exhibited significant positive interactions when compared with the effects of either compound alone (Fig. 2). Of the amino acids and peptides that had been identified as positive allosteric modulators of Cai2+ mobilization in HEK-CaR cells, l-Phe, γ-Glu-Ala, glutathione, and S-methylglutathione, together with another glutathione analog, S-propylglutathione were selected for further studies of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in fura-2 loaded normal human parathyroid cells. At Cao2+ concentrations at or below 0.5 mm, none of the compounds was effective. At Cao2+ concentrations greater than 1.0 mm, however, all of the compounds acutely mobilized intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3A). At a Ca2+ concentration of 1.5 mm, the concentration-response relations indicated that the γ-glutamyl peptides were effective in the micromolar concentration range with S-methylglutathione exhibiting a near maximal effect at around 2–5 μm (Fig. 3, B and C). The order of potency for intracellular Ca2+ mobilization was as follows: S-methylglutathione > glutathione > γ-Glu-Ala > S-propylglutathione (Fig. 3C and Table 2).TABLE 2Potencies of γ-glutamyl peptides for Cai2+ mobilization in normal human parathyroid cellsγ-Glutamyl peptideEC50 for peptideμmS-Methylglutathione0.38 ± 0.09 (n = 5)Glutathione5.4 ± 1.0 (n = 5)γ-Glu-Ala13.9 ± 5.7 (n = 6)S-Propylglutathione221 ± 107 (n = 4) Open table in a new tab We next tested the effects of γ-glutamyl peptides including γ-Glu-Ala, glutathione and S-methylglutathione (Fig. 4) on PTH secretion from perifused normal human parathyroid cells. All three peptides induced acute and reversible suppression of PTH secretion at a Cao2+ concentration of 1.0 mm (Fig. 4A) and exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of secretion (Fig. 4B; p < 0.01 for the effect of 20 μm S-methylglutathione with respect to the pre- and post controls). For S-methylglutathione, the IC50 value was 4.8 ± 0.3 μm (n = 3; Fig. 4, B and C). For γ-Glu-Ala, the IC50 value was ∼30 μm (supplemental Fig. S1). The results indicate that γ-glutamyl peptides and S-methylglutathione, in particular, are potent suppressors of PTH secretion raising the possibility that glutathione or an extracellular metabolite may act physiologically to modulate PTH secretion. In addition, S-methylglutathione or a structural analog may be of value in the treatment of various forms of hyperparathyroidism. Chimeric receptor analysis previously localized the CaR l-amino acid (14Mun H.C. Franks A.H. Culverston E.L. Krapcho K. Nemeth E.F. Conigrave A.D. J. Biol.

In the current study, we first confirmed that this mutant exhibited normal or near-normal Cao2+ sensitivity in the absence of l-Phe or S-methylglutathione (Fig. 5, A and B). In the presence of 10 mm l-Phe, HEK-293 cells expressing the wild-type CaR exhibited markedly enhanced Cao2+ sensitivity (Fig. 5C) whereas HEK-293 cells expressing the T145A/S170T double mutant CaR exhibited no change in Cao2+ sensitivity (Fig. 5D) as reported previously (15Mun H.C.

We next tested the impacts of the potent γ-glutamyl peptide, S-methylglutathione on the Cao2+ sensitivity of Ca2+i mobilization in wild-type CaR and T145A/S170T CaR-expressing cells. In HEK-CaR cells, 10 μm S-methylglutathione induced a marked increase in Cao2+ potency (Fig. 5E) but had little or no effect on Cao2+ potency in HEK-293 cells expressing the CaR double mutant T145A/S170T (Fig. 5F). Consistent with these findings, concentration-response relations for the wild-type CaR and T145A/S170T double mutant demonstrated very similar Cao2+ sensitivities in the absence of allosteric modulators (Fig. 6, A and B) and the EC50 values for Cao2+ were as follows: 3.9 ± 0.2 mm (n = 4) for HEK-293 cells that stably expressed the wild-type CaR and 3.6 ± 0.3 mm (n = 4) for HEK-293 cells that stably expressed the T145A/S170T double mutant CaR, respectively. Although the wild-type CaR exhibited markedly enhanced Cao2+ sensitivity in the presence of 10 mm l-Phe (EC50 for Cao2+ = 1.7 ± 0.3 mm; n = 4) or 10 μm S-methylglutathione (EC50 for Cao2+ = 2.4 ± 0.3 mm; n = 4), the double mutant exhibited markedly impaired responses to both modulators (see Fig. 6, A and B). Thus, the EC50 values for Cao2+ (in mm) were, respectively, 3.6 ± 0.3 (n = 5), 3.4 ± 0.2 (n = 7), and 3.5 ± 0.2 (n = 7) in the absence of modulators or in the presence of 10 mm l-Phe or 10 μm S-methylglutathione (p = 0.78 for l-Phe and p = 0.82 for S-methylglutathione with respect to control). To further investigate the impacts of l-Phe and S-methylglutathione on the CaR double mutant T145A/S170T, we examined the effects of stepwise increases in the concentrations of l-Phe and S-methylglutathione in the presence of a submaximal Cao2+ concentration, 2.5 mm using 5 μm NPS R-467 as a positive control (Fig. 7). In the case of the wild-type CaR, both l-Phe and S-methylglutathione induced robust concentration-dependent increases in Ca2+i mobilization in the presence of 2.5 mm Cao2+ (Fig. 7, A and C). In the case of the CaR double mutant T145A/S170T, however, the effects of both l-Phe and S-methylglutathione were attenuated (Fig. 7, B and D). Concentration-response relations for l-Phe and S-methylglutathione derived from experiments including those shown in Fig. 7 demonstrated marked impairment of Ca2+i mobilization responses in HEK-293 cells expressing the T145A/S170T double mutant when compared with wild-type (Fig. 8) and similar results were obtained whether the data were expressed as integrated fluorescence ratio responses (Fig. 8) or, alternatively, as fractional responses with respect to a control, 5 μm R-467 (not shown).FIGURE 8Behavior of CaR double mutant (T145A/S170T) in concentration-response analyses for l-Phe or S-methylglutathione-induced Cai2+ mobi"
https://openalex.org/W2003491575,"Background This study investigated the effects of obesity on attentional resources allocated to postural control in seating and unipedal standing. Methods Ten non obese adults (BMI = 22.4±1.3, age = 42.4±15.1) and 10 obese adult patients (BMI = 35.2±2.8, age = 46.2±19.6) maintained postural stability on a force platform in two postural tasks (seated and unipedal). The two postural tasks were performed (1) alone and (2) in a dual-task paradigm in combination with an auditory reaction time task (RT). Performing the RT task together with the postural one was supposed to require some attentional resources that allowed estimating the attentional cost of postural control. 4 trials were performed in each condition for a total of 16 trials. Findings (1) Whereas seated non obese and obese patients exhibited similar centre of foot pressure oscillations (CoP), in the unipedal stance only obese patients strongly increased their CoP sway in comparison to controls. (2) Whatever the postural task, the additional RT task did not affect postural stability. (3) Seated, RT did not differ between the two groups. (4) RT strongly increased between the two postural conditions in the obese patients only, suggesting that body schema and the use of internal models was altered with obesity. Interpretation Obese patients needed more attentional resources to control postural stability during unipedal stance than non obese participants. This was not the case in a more simple posture such as seating. To reduce the risk of fall as indicated by the critical values of CoP displacement, obese patients must dedicate a strong large part of their attentional resources to postural control, to the detriment of non-postural events. Obese patients were not able to easily perform multitasking as healthy adults do, reflecting weakened psycho-motor abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2085640039,"Because Varp (VPS9-ankyrin-repeat protein)/Ankrd27 specifically binds two small GTPases, Rab32 and Rab38, which redundantly regulate the trafficking of melanogenic enzymes in mammalian epidermal melanocytes, it has recently been implicated in the regulation of trafficking of a melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase-related protein 1 (Tyrp1) to melanosomes. However, the functional interaction between Rab32/38 and Varp and the involvement of the VPS9 domain (i.e. Rab21-GEF domain) in Tyrp1 trafficking have never been elucidated. In this study, we succeeded in identifying critical residues of Rab32/38 and Varp that are critical for the formation of the Rab32/38·Varp complex by performing Ala-based site-directed mutagenesis, and we discovered that a conserved Val residue in the switch II region of Rab32(Val-92) and Rab38(Val-78) is required for Varp binding activity and that its point mutant, Rab38(V78A), does not support Tyrp1 trafficking in Rab32/38-deficient melanocytes. We also identified two critical residues for Rab32/38 binding in the Varp ANKR1 domain and demonstrated that their point mutants, Varp(Q509A) and Varp(Y550A), do not support peripheral melanosomal distribution of Tyrp1 in Varp-deficient cells. Interestingly, the VPS9 domain point mutants, Varp(D310A) and Varp(Y350A), did support Tyrp1 trafficking in Varp-deficient cells, and knockdown of Rab21 had no effect on Tyrp1 distribution. We also found evidence for the functional interaction between a vesicle SNARE VAMP7/TI-VAMP and Varp in Tyrp1 trafficking. These results collectively indicated that both the Rab32/38 binding activity and VAMP7 binding activity of Varp are essential for trafficking of Tyrp1 in melanocytes but that activation of Rab21 by the VPS9 domain is not necessary for Tyrp1 trafficking."

IFN-α production during RNA virus infection is mediated by the master transcription factor IRF7, which is activated upon ubiquitination by TRAF6 and phosphorylation by IKKϵ and TBK1 kinases. We found that Fas-associated death domain (FADD), first described as an apoptotic protein, is involved in regulating IFN-α production through a novel interaction with TRIM21. TRIM21 is a member of a large family of proteins that can impart ubiquitin modification onto its cellular targets. The interaction between FADD and TRIM21 enhances TRIM21 ubiquitin ligase activity, and together they cooperatively repress IFN-α activation in Sendai virus-infected cells. FADD and TRIM21 can directly ubiquitinate IRF7, affect its phosphorylation status, and interfere with the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6. Conversely, a reduction of FADD and TRIM21 levels leads to higher IFN-α induction, IRF7 phosphorylation, and lower titers of RNA virus of infected cells. We conclude that FADD and TRIM21 together negatively regulate the late IFN-α pathway in response to viral infection.

Resolution of a functional costamere interactome is still limited but likely to be critical for understanding forms of muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. Dystrophin binds a set of membrane-associated proteins (the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex) as well as γ-actin and microtubules and also is required to align sarcolemmal microtubules with costameres. Ankyrin-B binds to dystrophin, dynactin-4, and microtubules and is required for sarcolemmal association of these proteins as well as dystroglycan. We report here that ankyrin-B interactions with β2 spectrin and dynactin-4 are required for localization of dystrophin, dystroglycan, and microtubules at costameres as well as protection of muscle from exercise-induced injury. Knockdown of dynactin-4 in adult mouse skeletal muscle phenocopied depletion of ankyrin-B and resulted in loss of sarcolemmal dystrophin, dystroglycan, and microtubules. Moreover, mutations of ankyrin-B and of dynactin-4 that selectively impaired binary interactions between these proteins resulted in loss of their costamere-localizing activity and increased muscle fiber fragility as a result of loss of costamere-associated dystrophin and dystroglycan. In addition, costamere-association of dynactin-4 did not require dystrophin but did depend on β2 spectrin and ankyrin-B, whereas costamere association of ankyrin-B required β2 spectrin. Together, these results are consistent with a functional hierarchy beginning with β2 spectrin recruitment of ankyrin-B to costameres. Ankyrin-B then interacts with dynactin-4 and dystrophin, whereas dynactin-4 collaborates with dystrophin in coordinating costamere-aligned microtubules."

Polymer synthesis is triggered by binding of its zinc finger 1 (Zn1) and 2 (Zn2) to DNA breaks and is followed by inactivation through automodification. The multiple functional domains of PARP-1 appear to regulate activation and automodification-mediated inactivation of PARP-1. However, the roles of these domains in activation-inactivation processes are not well understood. Our results suggest that Zn1, Zn2, and a domain identified in this study, the double-stranded DNA binding (DsDB) domain, are involved in DNA break-dependent activation of PARP-1. We found that binding of the DsDB domain to double-stranded DNA and DNA break recognition by Zn1 and Zn2, whose actual binding targets are likely to be single-stranded DNA, lead to the activation of PARP-1. In turn, the displacement of single- and double-stranded DNA from Zn2 and the DsDB domain caused by ADP-ribose polymer synthesis results in the dissociation of PARP-1 from DNA breaks and thus its inactivation. We also found that the WGR domain is one of the domains involved in the RNA-dependent activation of PARP-1. Furthermore, because zinc finger 3 (Zn3) has the ability to bind to single-stranded RNA, it may have an indirect role in RNA-dependent activation. PARP-1 functional domains, which are involved in oligonucleic acid binding, therefore coordinately regulate PARP-1 activity depending on the status of the neighboring oligonucleic acids.

PARP-1 activation also occurs through its binding to the linker DNA of nucleosomes and upon activation of transcription (11Kim M.Y. Mauro S. Gévry N. Lis J.T. Kraus W.L.

In addition to DNA, PARP-1 is capable of binding to RNA (13Parent M. Yung T.M. Rancourt A. Ho E.L. Vispé S. Suzuki-Matsuda F. Uehara A. Wada T. Handa H. Satoh M.S. J. Biol.

ADP-ribose synthesis leads to PARP-1 inactivation through automodification (27Zahradka P. Ebisuzaki K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These complex regulations of PARP-1 activity are carried out by at least six functional domains of PARP-1. PARP-1 is a 110-kDa enzyme with a modular architecture of multiple functional domains (see Fig. 1A). The most N-terminal end of PARP-1 is the DNA break binding (DBD) domain (28Gradwohl G. Ménissier de Murcia J.M. Molinete M. Simonin F. Koken M. Hoeijmakers J.H. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 2990-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 29Ikejima M.

Ménissier-de Murcia J. Schreiber V. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Binding of these zinc fingers to DSBs, SSBs and the linker DNA of nucleosomes is essential to activate PARP-1 (1Althaus F.R. Richter C. ADP-ribosylation of Proteins: Enzymology and Biological Significance. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987Crossref Google Scholar, 2de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Schreiber V.

Biol. 2007; 27: 7475-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that Zn1 recognizes DSBs and that Zn2 has a binding preference for SSBs, both fingers are required for full activation of PARP-1 (28Gradwohl G. Ménissier de Murcia J.M. Molinete M. Simonin F. Koken M. Hoeijmakers J.H. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 2990-2994Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 29Ikejima M. Noguchi S. Yamashita R.

It is, however, not well known how Zn1 and Zn2 recognize diverse types of DNA structures. Zn2 is linked to zinc finger 3 (Zn3) by a 26-residue peptide. This zinc finger was identified in recent years as being involved in PARP-1-PARP-1 homodimer formation (31Langelier M.F. Servent K.M. Rogers E.E. Pascal J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4105-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 32Tao Z. Gao P. Hoffman D.W. Liu H.W. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5804-5813Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Zn3 mutants are not activated by DNA breaks, indicating that functional homodimerization of PARP-1 through Zn3 is required for efficient activation of PARP-1 (33Altmeyer M. Messner S. Hassa P.O. Fey M. Hottiger M.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 3723-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 34Langelier M.F. Ruhl D.D. Planck J.L. Kraus W.L. Pascal J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 18877-18887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Following Zn3, an 80-residue peptide, which does not form any particular ternary structure, connects Zn3 with a domain called BRCT, involved in the interaction between PARP-1 and other enzymes, including XRCC1 and topoisomerase I (19Bauer P.I. Chen H.J. Kenesi E. Kenessey I. Buki K.G. Kirsten E. Hakam A. Hwang J.I. Kun E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Yung T.M. Sato S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Between the BRCT and the WGR domain, there is a highly basic 60-residue peptide in which the lysine and glutamic acid residues are known as ADP-ribose polymer attachment sites (33Altmeyer M. Messner S. Hassa P.O. Fey M. Hottiger M.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 3723-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 35Kameshita I. Matsuda Z. Taniguchi T. Shizuta Y. J. Biol.

Because this peptide does not form any particular ternary structure either, it is susceptible to protease digestion (35Kameshita I. Matsuda Z. Taniguchi T. Shizuta Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4770-4776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precise function of the WGR domain is not known, although a recent report suggests that it is involved in the regulation of the catalytic activity of PARP-1 (33Altmeyer M. Messner S. Hassa P.O. Fey M. Hottiger M.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 3723-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The C-terminal end of PARP-1 is the catalytic domain (CAT) domain, connected to the WGR domain by a 10-residue peptide. This domain is involved in ADP-ribose synthesis (2de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Schreiber V. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It appears that PARP-1 controls various fundamental cellular processes by coordinating the action of PARP-1 domains. Despite the accumulation of knowledge regarding such domains, the underlying mechanisms involved in PARP-1 activity regulation have not been fully elucidated. We thus performed characterization of Zn1, Zn2, Zn3, and the WGR domain. Furthermore, we have identified the double-stranded DNA binding domain (DsDB), which corresponds to the highly basic 60-residue peptide located between the BRCT and WGR domains. This domain, in its unbound form, inhibited the elongation of ADP-ribose polymers. Binding of the domain to dsDNA released the inhibition, allowing long ADP-ribose polymer formation. Our results suggest that the DsDB domain is one of the key domains involved in regulation of ADP-ribose polymer synthesis. Together with characterization results of the PARP-1 zinc fingers and WGR domain, we proposed a model for PARP-1 activity regulation. Sequences corresponding to Zn1 (aa 1–112), Zn2 (aa 94–213), Zn3 (aa 199–361), the DBD domain (aa 1–216), the DsDB-WGR-CAT fragment (aa 480–1014), the WGR-CAT fragment (aa 541–1014), the 89-kDa fragment (aa 215–1014), and the CAT domain (aa 656–1014) were cloned into pET32a. Proteins were expressed in HMS174 (DE3) pLysS and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose gel chromatography. In addition to His tag, FLAG tag was also attached at the N terminus of Zn1, Zn2, the DsDB-WGR-CAT, and the WGR-CAT fragments. Poly(dA), poly(dC), poly(T), poly(rA), poly(rC), poly(U), poly(dC)-biotin, and poly(U)-biotin of 30 nucleotides in length were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. ADP-ribose polymers labeled with 32P were prepared by incubation of PARP-1 (100 pmol) and [32P]NAD+ (10 μCi) in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 1 mm NAD+, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 30 °C. PARP-1 was then digested by proteinase K, and 32P-labeled ADP-ribose polymers were precipitated with ethanol. Reactions were carried out with 30 pmol of probes and various amounts of PARP-1 domains or fragments in 10-μl buffer aliquots containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at 23 °C. Proteins were fractionated on 7% native acrylamide gels. 32P activity was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a Typhoon 9200 imager (GE Healthcare) or an AlphaImager (Packard). Carboxyl surface sensor chips were purchased from Reichert Analytical Instruments. To create the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid surface, chips were washed with 1 mm NaOH. Then, the surface of the chips was soaked with 200 mm 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide for 10 min at room temperature followed by washing with 20 mm sodium acetate. Sensor chips were incubated with 1 mg/ml (S)-N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid hydrate for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing, the surface was treated with 1 m ethanolamine for 10 min at room temperature. Then, the surface was treated with 1 mm NaOH for 10 min and then incubated with 40 mm NiSO4 for 10 min at room temperature. After the surface was rinsed with 150 mm NaCl, the chips were used for analysis. A Reichert SR7000 was employed for analysis after immobilization of Zn1 or Zn2 to the sensor surface by injecting 1 mg/ml Zn1 or Zn2 at a flow rate of 0.005 ml/min. Then, the response was measured by injecting 25, 50, 75, 100, and 200 nm poly(dC) or poly(rC) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Binding constants of poly(dC) and poly(rC) to Zn1 or Zn2 were determined by the Prism and Scrubber programs. For dumbDNA, the sequence reported by Kulczyk et al. (38Kulczyk A.W. Yang J.C. Neuhaus D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 723-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was used. Two DNA stem loops (100 pmol) were ligated by T4 DNA ligase. Then, dumbDNA was fractionated on ethidium bromide-1% agarose gels and extracted. For the preparation of dumbDNA, which lacks DNA loops, 5′-CGACTCTGGCTGGCCGCGACCTCTGTCG-3′ and 5′-CGACAGAGGTCGCGGCCAGCCAGAGTCG-3′ were prepared and annealed. 5′-AAUGUUCUCGACAGCAAGUAC-3′ and 5′-GUACTTGCTGTCGAGAACAUU-3′ were annealed and used for assays. dumbDNAs or dsRNA (10 pmol) were incubated with various amounts of PARP-1 domains or fragments in a 20-μl mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at 37 °C. Reaction mixtures were fractionated on ethidium bromide-1.5% agarose gel. dumbDNAs or dsRNA were visualized using UV. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation assays were carried out with dumbDNAs with PARP-1 domains or fragments in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 1 μCi of [32P]NAD+, 1 mm NAD+, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 15 min. Proteins were fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Stacking gel was not used. 32P activity was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a Typhoon 9200 imager. The binding reaction was carried out as described above with 32P-labeled ADP-ribose polymers and Zn1, Zn2, the DsDB-WGR-CAT, or the WGR-CAT fragment. Then, these fingers or fragments were incubated with the anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing precipitates with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, urea-loading buffer was added. After incubation at 65 °C for 15 min, samples were fractionated on urea-10% or urea-15% polyacrylamide gel, and 32P activity was visualized by autoradiography. Either poly(dC)-biotin or poly(U)-biotin (0.25 pmol) was incubated with 32P-labeled poly(rA), poly(U), or poly(dC) (0.25 pmol) in 10 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and various amounts of PARP-1, Zn3, or the DBD domain for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then mixed with 5 μl of avidin-Sepharose for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the Sepharose, urea-loading buffer was added and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. 32P-labeled oligonucleic acids were fractionated on urea-10% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. DNA nicks, DNA gaps, and DSBs, including blunt, 3′-protruding, and 5′-protruding ends, are known binding targets of the DBD domain (2de Murcia G. Ménissier-de Murcia J. Schreiber V.

This domain is also capable of binding to DNA stem loops (41Lonskaya I. Potaman V.N. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Oussatcheva E.A. Lyubchenko Y.L. Soldatenkov V.A. J. Biol.

Recognit. 2009; 22: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), implying that the domain recognizes oligonucleic acid structures that commonly appear in DNA breaks and in DNA stem loops, such as ssDNA. Binding of the DBD domain to DNA breaks is a key step in PARP-1 activation, but its mechanism is not well understood. We thus began this study by characterizing Zn1 and Zn2 binding to ssDNA. When recombinant Zn1 and Zn2 (Fig. 1, A and B) were incubated with 30 nucleotides of synthetic 32P-labeled ssDNAs, i.e. poly(dA), poly(T), and poly(dC) (except poly(dG), which forms G-quadruplexes), discrete retarding bands were formed (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, neither recombinant showed significant binding to poly(rA), poly(U), and poly(rC) (Fig. 2B). We also used Zn3 and found that Zn3 is capable of binding to ssRNA (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that ssDNA is one of the potential binding targets of Zn1 and Zn2. Binding of Zn1 and Zn2 to ssDNA suggests that the DBD domain contains two ssDNA binding sites. To study whether the domain is capable of binding to two ssDNA molecules, we carried out cross-binding assays. As illustrated in Fig. 2C, this assay was designed to pull down 32P-labeled oligonucleic acid, using avidin-Sepharose, when the labeled oligonucleic acid binds to one functional zinc finger and biotinylated oligonucleic acid binds to the other. For example, 32P-labeled poly(rA) was pulled down when PARP-1 was incubated with biotinylated poly(dC), demonstrating the binding of Zn3 to poly(rA) and of Zn1 or Zn2 to poly(dC). 32P-labeled poly(U) is expected to be pulled down with biotinylated poly(U) if Zn3 forms a functional homodimer and if each Zn3 in the homodimer binds ssRNA. Indeed, 32P-labeled poly(U) was pulled down, suggesting that both Zn3 domains are capable of binding to ssRNA. In the case of the DBD domain, 32P-labeled poly(dC) was pulled down by avidin-Sepharose by incubation of the domain with biotinylated poly(dC). Two zinc fingers in the DBD domain can thus indeed independently bind to ssDNA. We then employed surface plasmon resonance biosensor and poly(dC) to investigate whether Zn1 and Zn2 have the necessary affinity to form stable complexes with ssDNA. As summarized in Table 1, the KD of Zn1 was 7.9 × 10−8 M. Although Zn2, which has a secondary role in DNA break binding (33Altmeyer M. Messner S. Hassa P.O. Fey M. Hottiger M.O.

Consistent with binding assay results (Fig. 2B), Zn1 and Zn2 showed negligible affinity for poly(rC). It has been reported that the binding affinity of PARP-1 toward DNA breaks is about 2.6 × 10−9 to 1.1 × 10−10 m (43D'Silva I. Pelletier J.D. Lagueux J. D'Amours D. Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. Lees-Miller S.P. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although the KD of Zn1 and Zn2 to poly(dC) is about 30–60-fold lower than that of PARP-1 to DNA breaks, these results suggest that Zn1 and Zn2 have sufficient affinity to establish stable bounds with ssDNAs. Thus, ssDNAs, which are formed at DNA break ends and at the loop region of DNA stem loops, can be binding targets of Zn1 and Zn2.TABLE 1Analysis of Zn1 and Zn2 binding to poly(dC) by surface plasmon resonance biosensorZn1Zn2KaKdKDKaKdKDm−1 s−1s−1mm−1 s−1s−1mpoly(dC)1.3 × 1050.01087.9 × 10−82.1 × 1050.03421.6 × 10−7poly(rC)NDNDNDNDNDND Open table in a new tab Although we have demonstrated that Zn1 and Zn2 bind to ssDNAs, biochemical studies of PARP-1 have indicated that ssDNAs only served as a weak activator of PARP-1 (39Benjamin R.C. Gill D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10502-10508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the explanations for this lack of full activation of PARP-1 by ssDNAs is that PARP-1 can distinguish whether it binds to free ssDNAs or to ssDNAs formed in dsDNA structures such as DNA breaks. Previously, Ikejima et al. (29Ikejima M. Noguchi S. Yamashita R. Ogura T. Sugimura T. Gill D.M. Miwa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21907-21913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested the presence of a dsDNA binding domain in the 89-kDa fragment of PARP-1 that is involved in the activation of PARP-1. Thus, we have studied whether such a domain indeed existed by preparing dsDNA with a minimal length of loop (dumbDNA (38Kulczyk A.W. Yang J.C. Neuhaus D. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 723-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 3A) and by carrying out DNA mobility assays. Zn1, Zn2, the DBD domain, Zn3, and the WGR-CAT fragment did not show any significant binding to dumbDNA (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, incubation of dumbDNA with the DsDB-WGR-CAT fragment, which contained a highly basic 60-residue peptide between the BRCT and the WGR domains, resulted in the formation of a smear that migrated near the origin. The DsDB-WGR-CAT fragment therefore bound to dumbDNA. Because dumbDNA contained small terminal loops, we then used dumbDNA that lacked these loops. Even in the absence of the loops, the DsDB-WGR-CAT fragment still bound dumbDNA (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the DsDB-WGR-CAT fragment did not show any specific binding to ssDNA (data not shown), and double-stranded RNA does not appear to be a preferred binding target for the DsDB domain (Fig. 3C). Thus, these results suggest that the dsDNA binding domain indeed exists as Ikejima et al. (29Ikejima M. Noguchi S. Yamashita R. Ogura T. Sugimura T. Gill D.M. Miwa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21907-21913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) predicted. We referred to this domain as the DsDB domain. Binding of Zn1 and Zn2 of the DBD domain to ssDNA and binding of the DsDB domain to dsDNA imply that a DNA structure composed of a junction between ssDNA and dsDNA could activate PARP-1. Thus, we prepared dumbDNA with a T-loop (dumbDNA-T) and dumbDNA containing an AT-rich region (dumbDNA-(AT)), which can be destabilized at 37 °C, thereby producing a single-stranded region (Fig. 4A). Although the DBD domain did not show significant binding to dumbDNA, it had the ability to bind to dumbDNA-T, dumbDNA-(AT), and dumbDNA-T(AT), which contained both the T-loop and the AT-rich region (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the ability of the DBD domain to bind dumbDNAs, the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity of PARP-1 was promoted, particularly by dumbDNA-(AT) and dumbDNA-T(AT) (Fig. 4C). Although DNA breaks were still the best PARP-1 activators, the promotion of automodified PARP-1 synthesis by these dumbDNAs suggests that activation of PARP-1 occurs through binding of Zn1 and Zn2 to ssDNA and of the DsDB domain to dsDNA at the junction between ssDNA and dsDNA. We then characterized the WGR domain, which is located at the N terminus of the DsDB domain and has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of the CAT domain (33Altmeyer M. Messner S. Hassa P.O. Fey M. Hottiger M.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 3723-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).

GST-PimM binds directly to eight promoters of the pimaricin cluster, as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Assays with truncated forms of the protein revealed that the PAS domain does not mediate specificity or the distinct recognition of target genes, which rely on the DBD domain, but significantly reduces binding affinity up to 500-fold. Transcription start points were identified by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and the binding regions of PimMDBD were investigated by DNase I protection studies. In all cases, binding took place covering the −35 hexamer box of each promoter, suggesting an interaction of PimM and RNA polymerase to cause transcription activation.

https://openalex.org/W2149809888,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the TNF superfamily. TRAIL is promising for anticancer therapy because it induces apoptosis in cancer cells with little or no toxicity to normal cells; hence, TRAIL-receptor agonists are currently undergoing clinical trials for cancer treatment. However, many molecular signaling mechanisms in TRAIL signaling are not completely characterized. The functions of adaptor proteins, including TNF-receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1) in TRAIL signaling have been controversial. We demonstrate that while wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are completely resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, MEFs derived from Tradd(-/-) mice are hypersensitive to TRAIL (IC(50)~0.5 nM rmTRAIL, 24 h), an effect also seen in primary keratinocytes treated with TRAIL/CHX. Restoration of TRADD in Tradd(-/-) MEFs restores TRAIL resistance, indicating that TRADD plays a survival role in TRAIL signaling. We show that TRADD is recruited to the TRAIL-receptor complex, and RIP1 recruitment is mediated by TRADD. While early activation of the MAP kinase ERK is deficient in Tradd(-/-) cells, the main mechanism for enhanced TRAIL sensitivity is likely due to increased recruitment of FADD to the receptor complex, indicating that TRADD may limit FADD binding within the receptor complex and also mediate RIP1-dependent nonapoptotic signaling events, thus reducing caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis. These novel findings have potential implications for cancer therapy using TRAIL-receptor agonists."

https://openalex.org/W2052133788,"Axons navigating through the developing nervous system are instructed by external attractive and repulsive cues. Emerging evidence suggests the same cues control dendrite development, but it is not understood how they differentially instruct axons and dendrites. We studied a C. elegans motor neuron whose axon and dendrite adopt different trajectories and lengths. We found that the guidance cue UNC-6 (Netrin) is required for both axon and dendrite development. Its repulsive receptor UNC-5 repelled the axon from the ventral cell body, whereas the attractive receptor UNC-40 (DCC) was dendritically enriched and promotes antero-posterior dendritic growth. Although the endogenous ventrally secreted UNC-6 instructs axon guidance, dorsal or even membrane-tethered UNC-6 could support dendrite development. Unexpectedly, the serine-threonine kinase PAR-4 (LKB1) was selectively required for the activity of the UNC-40 pathway in dendrite outgrowth. These data suggest that axon and dendrite of one neuron interpret common environmental cues with different receptors and downstream signaling pathways."

However, bioinformatic analysis revealed that many prokaryotic species that encode GSH-dependent proteins lack the gene for this enzyme. To understand how bacteria cope without gshA, we isolated Escherichia coli ΔgshA multigenic suppressors that accumulated physiological levels of GSH. Mutations in both proB and proA, the first two genes in L-proline biosynthesis, provided a new pathway for γ-glutamyl cysteine formation via the selective interception of ProB-bound γ-glutamyl phosphate by amino acid thiols, likely through an S-to-N acyl shift mechanism. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the L-proline biosynthetic pathway may have a second role in γ-glutamyl cysteine formation in prokaryotes. Also, we showed that this mechanism could be exploited to generate cytoplasmic redox buffers bioorthogonal to GSH."

IntroductionInfection with influenza viruses annually claims 250,000–500,000 lives worldwide (1Salomon R. Webster R.G. Cell. 2009; 136: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As exemplified by the 1918 influenza pandemic, which resulted in more than 50 million deaths (2Tumpey T.M. Belser J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), global spread of a pandemic influenza virus strain can lead to high morbidity and mortality. Besides inactivated vaccines, a live attenuated influenza virus vaccine (FluMist) (3Ambrose C.S. Luke C. Coelingh K. Influenza Other Respi.

Importantly, the degree of attenuation is critical for the safety of the live vaccines, but it also affects their efficacy. For safety reasons, children below the age of two and immunocompromised persons are excluded from vaccination with these live vaccines (3Ambrose C.S. Luke C. Coelingh K. Influenza Other Respi.

Furthermore, the live vaccine used in the 2007–2008 season was 50% less efficacious than the inactivated vaccine that was used (5Monto A.S. Ohmit S.E. Petrie J.G. Johnson E. Truscon R. Teich E.

Alteration of these conserved residues abrogates subunit interactions accompanied by restricted assembly of polymerase heterotrimers, resulting in decreased polymerase activities (6Perez D.R.

We identified mutations in the PA-binding domain of PB1 (PB1L8N), in the PB1-binding domain of PA (PAW706E), or in both domains simultaneously (PB1L8IPAW706E), all of which reduced PA-PB1 binding affinities, leading to impaired polymerase assembly and activity. We observed a correlation between reduction in polymerase activity and increased attenuation in cell culture and mice. Importantly, the attenuated phenotype of the polymerase assembly mutants was maintained in the IFNα/β receptor knock-out mice. Thus, targeting of the highly conserved protein-protein interaction domains of PA and PB1 represents a novel strategy to attenuate influenza A viruses.DISCUSSIONThe objective of this study was to generate attenuated influenza A viruses based on defects in the assembly of the polymerase complex. Accordingly, we reasoned that alteration of key amino acids involved in the subunit interactions would force the virus to escape by acquisition of new mutations, some of which would fail to restore efficient polymerase complex assembly and activity. Indeed, the majority of the rescued mutant viruses represent pseudo-revertants with various degrees of attenuation. Only a few intentionally introduced mutations (e.g. PB1L10D,K11D and PAW706E) were tolerated and, as predicted, recombinant viruses expressing these proteins were attenuated. However, the occurrence of compensatory mutations at other aa positions in PA or PB1 was not observed. This strongly suggests that only few aa exchanges are tolerated within these binding domains without loss of affinity. The lack of compensatory mutations especially in the relatively small core PA-binding domain might be caused by the involvement of several aa of the 310 helix in mediating contact to PA (12Obayashi E.

We therefore infer that targeting these key residues results in attenuation of virtually all influenza A virus strains. As exemplified by two unrelated viruses, the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain KAN-1 and the mouse-adapted strain SC35M (H7N7) mutation in PA (W706E) resulted in severe attenuation of both viruses in mice. However, the degree of attenuation is higher for the H5N1 mutant virus. This might reflect differences in intrinsic PA/PB1 binding affinities between these virus strains, as described recently for FluA and influenza B viruses (14Wunderlich K. Juozapaitis M. Mänz B. Mayer D. Götz V. Zöhner A. Wolff T. Schwemmle M. Martin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 16704-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).We also observed that targeting different key residues within the PA- or PB1-binding domains could vary the degree of attenuation because the mutation L8N in PB1 resulted in a less attenuated phenotype of SC35M in cell culture and mouse models when compared with the W706E mutation in PA or a combination of both mutations. The possibility to fine-tune the individual degree of attenuation by defined substitutions in PA or PB1 represents a unique tool to avoid over-attenuation. The repertoire of suitable mutations could possibly be extended to the similarly conserved PB2-PB1-binding site (11Sugiyama K. Obayashi E. Kawaguchi A. Suzuki Y. Tame J.R. Nagata K. Park S.Y. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1803-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).The polymerase assembly mutant viruses are also drastically attenuated in mice with immune system defects, as demonstrated in IFNAR0/0 mice, which are highly susceptible to virus infection (17Müller U.

We attribute this observation to the host-independent polymerase assembly defect of these viruses, which forces attenuation under all conditions. Our findings suggest that live vaccines harboring these mutations should possess a good safety profile in patients with impaired antiviral defense mechanisms.Several reasons might account for the genetic stability of the polymerase assembly mutants in mice and cell culture. The observed reduction in growth kinetics of these mutants further decreases the population size and thus the likelihood that viable escape mutants will emerge. Furthermore, the PB1/PA-binding interface is highly conserved and cannot tolerate many aa changes without reducing the binding affinity (12Obayashi E. Yoshida H. Kawai F. Shibayama N. Kawaguchi A.

Virol. 2007; 81: 7801-7804Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculate that point mutations, which cause reversions to wild-type polymerase activity, are unlikely.Live attenuated viruses confer several advantages as vaccines over traditionally used inactivated viruses, including induction of cellular as well as humoral immunity, broader protection among influenza virus subtypes, and better protection in children (3Ambrose C.S. Luke C. Coelingh K. Influenza Other Respi. Viruses. 2008; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the currently used cold-adapted influenza vaccine (FluMist) is not approved for children under the age of two or immunocompromised patients (3Ambrose C.S. Luke C. Coelingh K. Influenza Other Respi. Viruses. 2008; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our attenuation strategy might contribute to a better safety profile for these viruses, as demonstrated by infection of IFNAR0/0 mice. Furthermore, the cold-adapted master strain A/AnnArbor/6/60 H2N2 contains a fixed degree of attenuation (3Ambrose C.S. Luke C. Coelingh K. Influenza Other Respi. Viruses. 2008; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), whereas we have developed a strategy to easily identify new mutations, which allow attenuation to be fine-tuned.Overall, generation of polymerase assembly mutants can be applied to all influenza A viruses, resulting in adjusted degrees of attenuation. Thus, this novel approach may also contribute to the development of phenotypically stable live vaccines against seasonal and pandemic influenza. Furthermore, this attenuation strategy could also be used to make successful reassortment between attenuated live vaccines and circulating influenza A viruses less probable. Such reassortment events are of great concern because the resulting viruses might have an increased pathogenicity. By targeting a protein-protein interaction domain encoded on two segments, exchange of only one segment should maintain attenuation. However, our mutations could be combined with several other attenuation strategies, which have been described (3Ambrose C.S. Luke C. Coelingh K. Influenza Other Respi.

Thus, targeting the interaction domains of viral proteins that are essential for productive infection may represent a universal approach that could be applied to many other viruses. IntroductionInfection with influenza viruses annually claims 250,000–500,000 lives worldwide (1Salomon R. Webster R.G. Cell. 2009; 136: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As exemplified by the 1918 influenza pandemic, which resulted in more than 50 million deaths (2Tumpey T.M. Belser J.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), global spread of a pandemic influenza virus strain can lead to high morbidity and mortality. Besides inactivated vaccines, a live attenuated influenza virus vaccine (FluMist) (3Ambrose C.S. Luke C. Coelingh K. Influenza Other Respi. Viruses. 2008; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 4Maassab H.F. Nature. 1967; 213: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) is currently used for vaccination. Importantly, the degree of attenuation is critical for the safety of the live vaccines, but it also affects their efficacy. For safety reasons, children below the age of two and immunocompromised persons are excluded from vaccination with these live vaccines (3Ambrose C.S. Luke C. Coelingh K. Influenza Other Respi. Viruses. 2008; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the live vaccine used in the 2007–2008 season was 50% less efficacious than the inactivated vaccine that was used (5Monto A.S. Ohmit S.E. Petrie J.G. Johnson E. Truscon R. Teich E. Rotthoff J. Boulton M. Victor J.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 1260-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In the currently used influenza A virus (FluA) 3The abbreviations used are: FluAinfluenza A virusMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyIFNARIFNα receptoraaamino acid(s)p.i.post infection. live vaccine, the degree of attenuation is fixed because a specific master strain is used (3Ambrose C.S. Luke C. Coelingh K. Influenza Other Respi. Viruses. 2008; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, to vary the degree of attenuation and to identify new sites that contribute to the safety of live vaccines, new attenuation approaches applicable for all FluA strains are desirable.A promising target for attenuation of all known FluA strains is the trimeric polymerase complex. Its assembly from the subunits PA, PB1, and PB2 is crucial for polymerase activity and thus virus replication (6Perez D.R. Donis R.O. J.

https://openalex.org/W1984192235,"Background This study was designated to investigate whether increased extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) may correlate multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and mortality in sepsis. Methods We designed a prospective cohort study in an intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. Sixty-seven patients with severe sepsis were included. Data were used to determine an association between EVLWI and the development of MODS and mortality. These connections were determined by the multiple logistic regression, plotting the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and by Spearman test. Results EVLWI levels were higher in MODS patients on day 1 (median (IQR), 18(12.8–23.9) ml/kg, n = 38, p<0.0001) than in those without (median (IQR), 12.4 (7.9–16.3) ml/kg, n = 29) and day 3 (median (IQR), 17.8 (11.2–22.8) ml/kg, n = 29, p = 0.004) than in those without (median (IQR), 12.4 (8.0–16.3) ml/kg, n = 29). EVLWI was used as an independent predictor of the development of MODS (odds ratio, 1.6; p = 0.005; 95% confidence interval, 1.2∼2.2) during ICU stay. The area under the ROC curve showed that EVLWI levels could predict MODS (0.866) and mortality (0.881) during ICU stay. Meanwhile, the higher of SOFA score, the more EVLWI was found on day 1 (r = 0.7041, p<0.0001) and day 3 (r = 0.7732, p<0.0001). Conclusions Increased EVLWI levels correlates development of MODS and mortality during the patients' ICU stay. Further more, the potential of novel treatment in severe sepsis with lung injury may develop."
https://openalex.org/W1995359902,"Families of paralogous oligomeric proteins are common in biology. How the specificity of assembly evolves is a fundamental question of biology. The LysR-Type Transcriptional Regulators (LTTR) form perhaps the largest family of transcriptional regulators in bacteria. Because genomes often encode many LTTR family members, it is assumed that many distinct homooligomers are formed simultaneously in the same cell without interfering with each other's activities, suggesting specificity in the interactions. However, this assumption has not been systematically tested.A negative-dominant assay with λcI repressor fusions was used to evaluate the assembly of the LTTRs in E. coli K-12. Thioredoxin (Trx)-LTTR fusions were used to challenge the homooligomeric interactions of λcI-LTTR fusions. Eight cI-LTTR fusions were challenged with twenty-eight Trx fusions. LTTRs could be divided into three classes based on their interactions with other LTTRs.Multimerization of LTTRs in E. coli K-12 is mostly specific. However, under the conditions of the assay, many LTTRs interact with more than one noncognate partner. The physiological significance and physical basis for these interactions are not known."
https://openalex.org/W2086177258,"Ubiquitination is a common mechanism of down-regulation of mitogenic receptors. Here, we show that ubiquitination of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) at Lys(256) is necessary and sufficient for efficient Epo-induced receptor internalization, whereas ubiquitination at Lys(428) promotes trafficking of activated receptors to the lysosomes for degradation. Interestingly, EpoR that cannot be ubiquitinated has reduced mitogenic activities and ability to stimulate the STAT5, Ras/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. We therefore propose that ubiquitination of the EpoR critically controls both receptor down-regulation and downstream signaling."

In mouse sperm the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) isoform 4 plays a crucial role in Ca2+ transport. The two major splice variants of PMCA4 are PMCA4a and PMCA4b. PMCA4a differs from PMCA4b in the mechanism of calmodulin binding and activation. PMCA4a shows a much higher basal activity and is more effective than PMCA4b in returning Ca2+ to resting levels. Knock-out mice carrying a PMCA4-null mutation are infertile because their sperm cannot achieve a hyperactivated state of motility. As sperm reach functional maturity during their transit through the epididymis, the expression of PMCA4a and 4b was assessed in bull testis and epididymis. Quantitative PCR revealed that PMCA4b is the major splice variant in testis, caput, and corpus epididymidis. In contrast, PMCA4a is the major splice variant in cauda epididymidis, whereas sperm are transcriptionally silent. Immunohistochemical staining using a new antibody against bovine PMCA4a located the PMCA4a to the apical membrane of the epithelium of cauda epididymidis, whereas testis, caput, and corpus epididymidis were negative. Western blotting of testis, epididymis, and sperm isolated from caput and cauda epididymidis showed a much higher level of PMCA4a in cauda epididymidis and sperm from cauda epididymidis compared with testis membranes and sperm from caput epididymidis.

Null mice show normal spermatogenesis and mating behavior, but sperm of these animals cannot achieve a hyperactivated state of motility. Furthermore, PMCA4 is essential for achieving a low resting Ca2+ concentration in mouse sperm, whereas the contribution of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, mitochondrial uniporter, and the sarcoleudoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump to this effect are minimal (11Wennemuth G. Babcock D.F. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, a pivotal role of PMCA4 in the regulation of sperm function and intracellular Ca2+ levels in sperm has been proposed (7Okunade G.W. Miller M.L. Pyne G.J. Sutliff R.L. O'Connor K.T.

The epididymis is essential for sperm to acquire their fertilization capacity. Sperm maturation during transit through the epididymis from caput to cauda epididymidis is characterized by a change in the phospholipid and cholesterol composition of the sperm plasma membrane, modification of plasma membrane protein composition, and nuclear condensation of sperm (13Cooper T.G. Andrologia. 1996; 28: 57-59PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed the gene and protein expression of PMCA4 in bull testis, epididymis, and sperm because this PMCA isoform is believed to be essential for sperm fertilization capacity. We found that the two PMCA splice variants 4a and 4b are differentially expressed with a shift from 4b to 4a along the length of the epididymis from caput to cauda. This suggests that functional sperm maturation requires a shift in calcium pump expression from the slow PMCA4b to the faster PMCA4a isoform. Bovine testes and epididymides were obtained from the local slaughterhouse. Testes and epididymides were dissected immediately and frozen in liquid N2 for subsequent expression analysis or fixed with Bouin's fixative in PBS (pH 7.4) for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization experiments. Isolation of sperm from caput, corpus, and cauda epididymidis was performed as described previously (14Wilhelm B. Brandenburger T. Post H. Aumüller G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 129: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Total RNA from bull epididymidis (caput, corpus, and cauda), testis, seminal vesicle, heart, liver, and sperm was extracted using TriFAST Reagent (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was reverse transcribed as described (14Wilhelm B. Brandenburger T. Post H. Aumüller G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 129: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fragments of PMCA4 and β-actin cDNA were amplified in a total volume of 25 μl, containing 50 pmol of reverse and forward primers, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 μl of 10 × PCR buffer, 0.25 unit of PlatinumTaq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 10 mm nucleotide mix (Promega, Madison, WI), and 1 μl of cDNA. The primer sequences were as follows: PMCA4 forward, 5′-CAC CTT CGT GCT CAT GCA GC-3′; PMCA4 reverse, 5′-TGG AGT GAC CTC ACC ATC CAG-3′ (631-bp and 812-bp fragments for PMCA4b and PMCA4a, respectively); β-actin forward, 5′-GGA CTT CGA GCA AGA GAT GG-3′; β-actin reverse, 5′-AGC ACT GTG TTG GCG TAC AG-3′ (288 bp). The conditions for PMCA4 amplification were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 59 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 60 s. For β-actin, 28 cycles were performed consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s followed by annealing at 60 °C for 30 s and elongation at 72 °C for 40 s. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels and eluted using the Qiaex kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR products were subsequently cloned into the pCR®II vector using the TA Cloning kit Dual Promoter (Invitrogen) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain inv-alpha F′. The insert was sequenced by MWG (Ebersberg, Germany) and the sequences were aligned using the BLAST program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Total RNA was isolated as described above (n = 4). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Master Mix according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences were as follows: PMCA4 forward, 5′-GGC CAG GTC ATY TCY RCR ATA CCT AC-3′; PMCA4 reverse, 5′-AGC TCC ATC TCK GCA TGG TC-3′; PMCA4a reverse, 5′-CTC CCG TCT GGA ATK TGT TAA TTA C-3′; TaqMan probe, 6FAM-AAG GAY GCT GAG GGG CTG GA-BBQ (K = G/T; Y = C/T; R = A/G) (TIB Molbiol, Berlin, Germany). β-Actin was used for normalization (Assay ID Bt03279174_g1; Applied Biosystems). qPCR conditions were: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s on an Applied BioSystems 7300HT thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). All samples were run in duplicate, and PCR was repeated at least twice. Relative expression was estimated using the ΔΔCt method (15Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25138) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and labeling of riboprobes for PMCA4 were performed as described (14Wilhelm B. Brandenburger T. Post H. Aumüller G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2008; 129: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization was performed as described in detail by Wilhelm et al. (16Wilhelm B. Meinhardt A. Renneberg H. Linder D. Gabius H.J. Aumüller G. Seitz J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, deparaffinized tissue sections from testes and epididymides were treated with 0.1 m HCl for 10 min and incubated with proteinase K (15 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C to increase probe accessibility. After incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min, sections were rinsed twice in PBS. Thereafter, sections were acetylated and prehybridized in 50% deionized formamide, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl, 250 μg/ml tRNA, and 2.5 × Denhardt's solution for 2 h at 45 °C. Hybridization was performed overnight at 45 °C in hybridization buffer, consisting of prehybridization buffer plus 10% dextran sulfate and DIG-labeled PMCA4 probe (5 ng/μl). In situ hybridization was detected after overnight incubation with an anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated Fab fragment (diluted 1:500; Roche Diagnostics). Bound alkaline phosphatase was visualized by an enzyme-catalyzed color reaction utilizing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium salt (Promega) as chromogenic substrates. Primers for cloning of the full-length bovine splice variants PMCA4a and 4b were as follows: PMCA4 cloning forward, 5′-GTT GAG GGG CTT GGT AAC AG-3′; PMCA4 cloning reverse, 5′-TGG AGT GAC CTC ACC ATC CAG-3′. The PCR conditions were: 95 °C for 10 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 180 s. Complete cDNAs of the two PMCA4 splice variants were amplified using the Accu Prime Polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR products were gel electrophoresed and eluted using the Qiaex kit (Qiagen). The eluted products were cloned into TOPO XL vector (TOPO® XL PCR Cloning kit; Invitrogen) and transformed into chemically competent E. coli (XL Gold®). The insert was restricted by the endonucleases HindIII and SacI. Clones containing inserts of adequate size were sequenced twice by MWG (Ebersberg, Germany), and the sequences were aligned using BLAST at NCBI. Expression of human PMCA4a and 4b in Sf9 cells was performed as described previously (17Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25640-25648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Crude microsomal membranes from Sf9 cells, untransfected or transfected with PMCA4a or PMCA4b, were prepared as described for COS cells with some minor modifications (18Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10621-10626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of the amount of PMCA in microsomal membranes was done as described (17Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25640-25648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The included exon of splice variant 4a was identified by cloning and sequencing. The resulting amino acid sequence of bovine PMCA4a was subsequently used to identify a peptide for immunization (Coring; Gernsheim, Germany): GQHLDVKHVPSSSYV (residues 1114–1128, GI: 284156666). This peptide sequence shows no homology to other proteins but is 93% identical to the human PMCA4a sequence. A polyclonal antibody directed against the peptide was raised in rabbits according to a standard protocol (Coring). The polyclonal antibody was affinity-purified on a Sepharose column coupled to the immunogenic peptide. Specificity of the antibody was tested by ELISA (CovAbtest; Coring) and Western blotting using human PMCA4a and 4b overexpressed in SF9 cells as well as bovine brain membranes. A negative control was performed with the preimmune serum and showed no binding. Microsomal membranes of bovine brain, testis, epididymis, and sperm were prepared according to Sikdar et al. (19Sikdar R. Ganguly U. Pal P. Mazumder B. Sen P.C. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 103: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Sperm originating either from caput or cauda epididymidis as well as testis and epididymidis (caput, corpus, cauda) were homogenized in homogenization buffer (25 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 250 mm sucrose, and the protease inhibitor CompleteTM; 1 tablet/50 ml; Roche Diagnostics) using a tissue homogenizer. After centrifugation for 10 min at 600 × g and 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer, homogenized, and centrifuged again as above. The pooled supernatants were spun at 12,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer, and protein concentration was determined as described previously (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). 30 μg (PMCA4) or 40 μg (PMCA4a) of sperm, testis, epididymis, or brain membrane protein or 1 μg of recombinant overexpressed human PMCA4a and 4b was separated as described (14Wilhelm B.

After Western blotting transfer, membranes were incubated with the isoform-specific PMCA4 antibody (1:1,000 JA9 monoclonal; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) or the newly generated splice variant specific polyclonal PMCA4a antibody (1:100) at room temperature overnight. After washing, membranes were incubated with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)-anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (POD) antibody or ECL-anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (POD) antibody (1:2,000; Amersham Biosciences). The peroxidase reaction was visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Deparaffinized sections were rinsed twice in PBS, blocked in PBS containing 5% dried nonfat milk powder for 30 min, and incubated at 4 °C overnight with the isoform-specific PMCA4 antibody (1:1,000 JA9) or the splice variant-specific PMCA4a antibody (1:500). Bound antibody was detected using the CSA kit (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR values are presented as means ± S.D. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. The cDNA sequences of bovine PMCA4 splice variants were only partially known prior to this study. We therefore cloned and sequenced the bovine splice variants PMCA4a and 4b and deposited the complete sequences in the NCBI GenBank data base (GI:284156665, accession number, GU353069 for PMCA4a; GI:284156667, accession number GU353070 for PMCA4b).

To obtain information on the expression of the C-terminal splice variants of PMCA4 in bull testis and epididymis, we performed RT-PCR using primers flanking splice site C. Brain membranes were used as control tissue known to express PMCA4a and 4b. As shown in Fig. 1, PMCA4 is expressed in bull testis and all parts of the epididymis including caput, corpus, and cauda. Two major PCR fragments of 812 and 631 bp were observed which showed distinct distribution in different parts of the epididymis. Sequence analysis of the 631-bp PCR product confirmed that it corresponds to the PMCA4 cDNA sequence from position 2895–3525 representing the PMCA4b splice variant. The 812-bp PCR product matched with the cDNA sequence of PMCA4a and included an alternatively spliced exon of 181 bp in the C-terminal region. The PCR results show a switch of splice variant 4b to variant 4a from caput and corpus to cauda epididymis. Whereas PMCA4b is the quantitatively major splice variant in caput and corpus, PMCA4a predominates in cauda epididymidis. To investigate this finding further, we cut the bovine epididymis into 19 pieces, each 1 cm in length (Fig. 2A). We then performed semiquantitative RT-PCR and confirmed that although PMCA4b dominates in caput and corpus epididymidis, there is a distinct switch to splice variant 4a immediately beginning in cauda epididymidis (Fig. 2, B and C).FIGURE 2Semiquantitative PMCA4 RT-PCR of bovine epididymis. A, the bovine epididymis was cut into 19 pieces. Pieces 1-5 represent caput, pieces 6-17 represent corpus, and pieces 18 and 19 represent cauda epididymidis. B, PMCA4 gene expression was analyzed by using primers flanking splice site C. Bovine brain RNA served as positive control (lane B). Negative controls were performed by omitting cDNA (Neg). The PCR product of 812 bp represents PMCA4a, and the PCR product of 631 bp represents PMCA4b. A splice variant switch from PMCA4b to 4a is observed from corpus (piece 17) to cauda epididymidis (piece 18). C, β-Actin PCR served as internal standard.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression of PMCA4 and 4a transcripts in bull testis, epididymis, and sperm from caput and cauda epididymidis was further analyzed by qPCR. Fig. 3 shows the expression level of all PMCA4 transcripts (Fig. 3A) and of PMCA4a-specific transcripts (Fig. 3B) relative to that in bovine brain. The highest expression of PMCA4 mRNA (including both splice variants 4a and 4b) is found in cauda epididymidis (4.7-fold higher compared with brain, p < 0.01). PMCA4 mRNA levels in cauda are significantly higher (p < 0.01) than in testis and caput epididymidis. In contrast, expression of PMCA4 in testis and caput epididymidis is not significantly different from brain (relative expression testis, 2.2; caput epididymidis, 0.8). No expression of PMCA4 transcripts is detected in sperm from caput and cauda epididymidis, demonstrating the transcriptional inactivity of sperm. Similar to total PMCA4, the highest level of PMCA4a transcripts is observed in cauda epididymidis (3.2-fold higher than in brain, p < 0.01; Fig. 3B). This level is significantly (p < 0.01) higher compared with testis and caput epididymidis where PMCA4a transcripts are lower than in the brain (relative levels 0.6 and 0.83, respectively). As expected, PMCA4a transcripts are not expressed in sperm isolated from either caput or cauda epididymidis (Fig. 3B). To obtain information on the specific cell types that express the PMCA4, we performed in situ hybridization on paraffin-embedded sections. In the bovine testis, PMCA4 transcripts were expressed predominantly in spermatogonia and spermatocytes I (Fig. 4A). Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and peritubular cells are negative for PMCA4 RNA. PMCA4 mRNA was also not detectable in later spermatogenic stages such as late spermatocytes or spermatids (Fig. 4A). In the epididymis, strong expression was found in the epithelium of principal and basal cells of caput, corpus, and cauda, whereas the stroma was negative (Fig. 4, B–D). To determine the expression and localization pattern of the PMCA4 splice variants, we first generated an antibody specific for PMCA4a, using a unique peptide located in the C-terminal region of the bovine PMCA (see “Experimental Procedures”). To demonstrate the specificity of this antibody, human PMCA4a and 4b, overexpressed in Sf9 cell membranes, as well as bovine brain membranes, were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5B, the antibody recognizes human PMCA4a and a band of similar size (∼130 kDa) representing bovine PMCA4a in membranes from bovine brain. By contrast, the antibody fails to react with human PMCA4b. Both the human PMCA4a and 4b splice variants and the bovine brain membranes showed positive signals with the monoclonal pan-PMCA4 antibody JA9 (Fig. 5A). To localize PMCA4 in bull spermatogenic cells and epididymis, we performed immunohistochemical staining on paraffin-embedded sections of bull testis and epididymis, using the monoclonal antibody JA9 against all PMCA4 splice variants and the new polyclonal antibody against PMCA4a (Fig. 6). A PMCA4 signal is detectable in later stages of spermatogenesis in bull testis. Round and elongated spermatids are strongly positive for PMCA4 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, spermatogonia are negative or only faintly positive for PMCA4. In caput and corpus epididymidis, the peritubular cells show a stronger PMCA4 signal than the epithelial cells (Fig. 6, B and C). In cauda epididymidis, the basolateral membranes of the principal epithelial cells are highly positive for PMCA4 (Fig. 6D). On the other hand, a strong signal with the splice variant specific PMCA4a antibody was only observed in cauda epididymidis. Interestingly, PMCA4a staining is concentrated in the apical membranes of the principal cells in cauda epididymidis (Fig. 6H). Testis, caput, and corpus epididymidis are mostly negative for PMCA4a (Fig. 6, E–G). Finally, we analyzed the distribution of PMCA4 in bull testis, epididymis, and epididymal spermatozoa by Western blotting using the monoclonal pan-PMCA4 antibody and the polyclonal PMCA4a antibody. As expected, PMCA4 is present in testis and all parts of the epididymis as well as in the membranes from caput and cauda sperm. A double band, representing PMCA4a (128 kDa) and 4b (133 kDa), is visible in caput sperm and in tissue membranes of the epididymis (Fig. 7A). The signal for PMCA4a (lower band in Fig. 7A) is increasing from epididymal caput to cauda tissue, with the strongest PMCA4a band in cauda epididymidis. In contrast, the PMCA4a signal in caput sperm membranes is weak (lower band in Fig. 7A). Interestingly, only a single PMCA4-positive band is detectable in cauda sperm membranes and in testis. In testis, this is the more slowly migrating upper band corresponding to PMCA4b, whereas in cauda sperm, it is the lower band representing PMCA4a (Fig. 7A). To corroborate these findings, we used the new splice variant-specific PMCA4a antibody on a Western blot of the same sperm and tissue samples (Fig. 7B). As expected, the antibody detects a single band corresponding to the ∼128 kDa band recognized by the pan-PMCA4 antibody. PMCA4a is virtually undetectable in caput sperm membranes and appears as a weak and diffuse signal in testis. In contrast, PMCA4a is clearly detected in all parts of the epididymis, showing the expected increase in signal strength from epididymal caput to cauda tissue membranes (Fig. 7B). PMCA4a is also readily detected in cauda sperm membranes, with a signal that is much stronger than in caput sperm membranes. Taken together, the above results suggest that sperm in the epididymis undergo a splice variant shift from PMCA4b to 4a as they are transferred from caput to cauda. Because sperm in their late developmental stages show little or no PMCA4 transcriptional activity (as is evident from the qPCR and in situ hybridization data; FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4A), they likely acquire the PMCA4a isoform through a transcellular route from the epididymal cauda epithelium. PMCA4 appears to be essential for male fertility. PMCA4-knock-out mice are infertile. Sperm taken from these animals fail to achieve the hyperactivated motility needed to traverse the female genital tract (7Okunade G.W. Miller M.L. Pyne G.J. Sutliff R.L. O'Connor K.T. Neumann J.C.

Most mutations encountered in CDG are hypomorphic, thus leaving residual activity to the affected biosynthetic enzymes. We hypothesized that increased cellular levels of Dol-linked substrates might compensate for the low biosynthetic activity and thereby improve the output of protein N-glycosylation in CDG. To this end, we investigated the potential of the squalene synthase inhibitor zaragozic acid A to redirect the flow of the polyisoprene pathway toward Dol by lowering cholesterol biosynthesis. The addition of zaragozic acid A to CDG fibroblasts with a Dol-P-Man synthase defect led to the formation of longer Dol-P species and to increased Dol-P-Man levels. This treatment was shown to decrease the pathologic accumulation of incomplete Dol pyrophosphate-GlcNAc2Man5 in Dol-P-Man synthase-deficient fibroblasts. Zaragozic acid A treatment also decreased the amount of truncated protein N-linked oligosaccharides in these CDG fibroblasts. The increased cellular levels of Dol-P-Man and possibly the decreased cholesterol levels in zaragozic acid A-treated cells also led to increased availability of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor as shown by the elevated cell-surface expression of the CD59 protein.

Acta. 2009; 1792: 896-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) form the molecular basis of CDG. The majority of CDG encompass disorders affecting the assembly of the LLO precursor dolichol pyrophosphate (Dol-PP)-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3, which lead to under-occupancy of N-glycosylation sites (6Haeuptle M.A. Hennet T. Hum. Mutat. 2009; 30: 1628-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The stepwise biosynthesis of the LLO precursor begins at the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by transfer of GlcNAc-P to Dol-P and completes at the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Dol-P serves not only as a carrier of maturing LLO but also as a lipid component of Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc, both donor substrates for luminally acting mannosyl- and glucosyltransferases (7Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). The symptoms associated with CDG are principally of neurologic nature, such as psychomotor retardation, ataxia, and hypotonia, but also include hormonal alterations and coagulopathies (8Leroy J.G. Pediatr. Res. 2006; 60: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The clinical severity of CDG depends mainly on the degree of N-glycosylation site under-occupancy (9Hülsmeier A.J. Paesold-Burda P. Hennet T. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 2132-2138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which itself depends on the available pool of the complete LLO Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3. To date, only two forms of CDG can be successfully treated by oral carbohydrate supplementation. The glycosylation defects resulting from deficiency of Man-P isomerase can be corrected by Man supplementation (10Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Körner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P.

Skovby F. Freeze H.H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas Fuc uptake has been shown to rescue the deficiency of GDP-Fuc transport (12Marquardt T. Lühn K. Srikrishna G. Freeze H.H. Harms E. Vestweber D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3976-3985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the involvement of Dol throughout the LLO biosynthetic pathway, we hypothesized that increased cellular levels of Dol- and Dol-P-based substrates may increase the formation of Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 in CDG. Dol biosynthesis follows the sterol pathway up to the formation of the C15-intermediate farnesyl-PP (Fig. 1A) (13Swiezewska E. Danikiewicz W. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 235-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Instead of squalene formation by head-to-head assembly of two farnesyl-PP molecules (14Muscio F. Carlson J.P. Kuehl L. Rilling H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3746-3749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the consecutive condensation of isopentenyl-PP units leads to the diverging synthesis of polyprenyl-PP, a pre-stage of Dol-P. The enzyme squalene synthase catalyzes the first reaction, leading exclusively to the formation of sterol compounds, such as cholesterol and steroid hormones (Fig. 1A). Inhibition of squalene synthase, e.g. by zaragozic acid A (ZGA), leads to the stimulation of prior diverging pathways and hence to increased formation of Dol and Dol-P (15Keller R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ZGA, also known as squalestatin I, was discovered by screening metabolites of filamentous fungi for cholesterol-lowering activity (16Bergstrom J.D. Dufresne C. Bills G.F. Nallin-Omstead M. Byrne K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 607-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis disclosed that ZGA acts as a competitive inhibitor of squalene synthase by mimicking the farnesyl-PP substrate or the stable intermediate presqualene-PP with its bicyclic, highly acidic core (Fig. 1B). In contrast to statins acting on common steps of both Dol and cholesterol biosynthesis, such as the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors pravastatin (17Koga T. Shimada Y. Kuroda M. Tsujita Y. Hasegawa K. Yamazaki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1045: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), lovastatin (18Alberts A.W. Chen J. Kuron G. Hunt V. Huff J. Hoffman C. Rothrock J. Lopez M. Joshua H. Harris E. Patchett A. Monaghan R. Currie S. Stapley E. Albers-Schonberg G. Hensens O. Hirshfield J. Hoogsteen K. Liesch J. Springer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 3957-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar), and rosuvastatin (19McTaggart F. Buckett L. Davidson R. Holdgate G. McCormick A. Schneck D. Smith G. Warwick M. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 87: 28B-32BAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ZGA does not negatively affect the diverging pathways generating Dol, ubiquinone, or prenylated proteins (Fig. 1A). In this study, we investigated the ability of the squalene synthase inhibitor to increase Dol biosynthesis and thereby the output of N-glycosylation in CDG fibroblasts. ZGA was a gift from Merck. The C80-polyprenyl-P standards were purchased from Larodan Fine Chemicals AB (Malmö, Sweden), and broad-range mammalian Dol-P standards were from Sigma. Acetonitrile (Scharlau, Barcelona, Spain), dichloromethane (Sigma), and water (Sigma) were HPLC grade; other chemicals were analytical grade. Human primary skin fibroblasts (4 × 107 cells) cultured in DMEM (Sigma) with 10% fetal calf serum (Bioconcept, Allschwil, Switzerland) at 37 °C were treated for 72 h with either 100 μm ZGA or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) alone as a negative control. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in PBS, and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. To the cell pellet was added 1 ml of 4% (w/v) KOH in 90% ethanol. After vortexing, the solution was incubated for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath and transferred to a glass tube. After the addition of 80 μl of internal standard (0.1 mg/ml epi-coprostanol (Sigma) in pyridine), the solution was saponified for 60 min at 60 °C, mixed with 1 ml of water, and extracted three times with 2 ml of heptane. The pooled heptane extracts were dried under nitrogen and derivatized with 75 μl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (Macherey-Nagel, Oensingen, Switzerland) in 75 μl of pyridine at 60 °C for 60 min. For GC/MS analysis, the derivative mixture was diluted 5-fold with heptane, and 1 μl was injected (injector temperature of 280 °C, splitless injection). A Restek Rtx-1MS column (15 m, inner diameter of 0.25 mm; BGB Analytik AG, Böckten, Switzerland) was used for chromatographic separation of the sterols. The carrier gas was helium at a constant flow of 1.5 ml/min. After a dwell time of 3 min at 90 °C, the oven temperature was raised to 200 °C at 20 °C/min and then to 260 °C at 1.5 °C/min and was finally held at 260 °C for 10 min. MS was performed on a Finnigan PolarisQ ion trap mass spectrometer. Mass spectra were acquired in the mass range of m/z = 50–550. Fibroblasts (4 × 107 cells) were harvested and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were dissolved in 12 ml of water/methanol (1:1). Prior to alkaline hydrolysis (20Elmberger P.G. Eggens I. Dallner G. Biomed. Chromatogr. 1989; 3: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), 15 μg of C80-polyprenyl-P standards was added. The extracted Dol and Dol-P were purified on a Sep-Pak C18 column (Waters) and subsequently separated on a Sep-Pak silica column (Waters) (21Haeuptle M.A. Hülsmeier A.J. Hennet T. Anal. Biochem. 2010; 396: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Dol-P was dimethylated using diazomethane generated in an Aldrich diazomethane generator system (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting Dol-P-Me2 was selectively demethylated by overnight incubation in tert-butylamine (Sigma) at 70 °C (22Yamada K. Abe S. Suzuki T. Katayama K. Sato T. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Monomethylated Dol-P samples were dissolved in a saturated solution of 9-anthryldiazomethane (Sigma) in diethyl ether and incubated for 6 h on ice in the dark. Anthracene-labeled Dol-P was separated from non-reacted labeling agent by organic extraction (22Yamada K. Abe S. Suzuki T. Katayama K. Sato T. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The purified products were dissolved in acetonitrile/dichloromethane (3:2) and subjected to HPLC on an Inertsil ODS-3 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm; GL Sciences, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a precolumn. Isocratic elution in acetonitrile/dichloromethane (3:2) and 0.01% diethylamine (Sigma) was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (22Yamada K. Abe S. Suzuki T. Katayama K. Sato T. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fluorescent-labeled Dol-P were detected by excitation at 365 nm and emission at 412 nm. Defined amounts of the internal standard C80-polyprenyl-P were used for quantification. Approximately 4 × 107 fibroblasts were grown for 72 h in DMEM containing low Glc (5 mm; Sigma) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum and 100 μm ZGA or DMSO as a negative control. Low Glc medium was utilized to achieve improved Man incorporation (23Körner C. Lehle L. von Figura K. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cellular Dol-P-Man was metabolically labeled, extracted, and purified according to the protocol of Körner et al. (23Körner C. Lehle L. von Figura K. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fibroblasts were labeled by incubation in DMEM containing 0.5 mm Glc and 125 μCi of [3H]Man (Hartmann Analytic GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) for 30 min. Dol-P-Man and short LLO were extracted once with chloroform/methanol (2:1) and twice with chloroform/methanol (3:2). The combined organic phases were dried and washed. Thin-layer chromatography on Silica Gel 60 plates was performed in chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4). The plates were analyzed by radiography after signal enhancement with an EN3HANCE spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the areas containing Dol-P-Man were scraped and counted in a Packard Tri-Carb 2900TR liquid scintillation analyzer. Fibroblasts (2 × 105 cells) were harvested by trypsinization, washed once in PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum, and incubated with FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD59 antibody (Pharmingen) diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum for 20 min on ice (24Imbach T. Schenk B. Schollen E. Burda P. Stutz A. Grunewald S. Bailie N.M. King M.D. Jaeken J. Matthijs G. Berger E.G. Aebi M. Hennet T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were washed and analyzed on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). The LLO profiles of 1.5 × 107 fibroblasts treated for 72 h with either 100 μm ZGA or DMSO were analyzed as described (25Haeuptle M.A. Pujol F.M. Neupert C. Winchester B. Kastaniotis A.J. Aebi M. Hennet T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 82: 600-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cells were starved for 45 min in fetal calf serum- and Glc-free DMEM (Invitrogen) and metabolically labeled for 60 min by the addition of 150 μCi of [3H]Man. LLO were extracted from cell pellets, and oligosaccharides were released by mild acid hydrolysis in 0.1 n HCl. Glycoproteins recovered from the LLO extraction were denatured, and NLO were released by overnight incubation with peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) (26Grubenmann C.E. Frank C.G. Kjaergaard S. Berger E.G. Aebi M. Hennet T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides were purified by ion-exchange chromatography on AG 1-X2 and AG 50W-X8 resins (Bio-Rad) and by hydrophobic chromatography on Supelclean ENVI-Carb 120/400 beads (Supelco) and Sep-Pak C18 columns and subjected to HPLC analysis. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance test with the Bonferroni multiple comparison post-test was applied to confirm differences between groups. Significance was accepted for p < 0.05. The toxicity of ZGA was first determined by incubating human primary skin fibroblasts for 10 days with increasing concentrations of 10–500 μm. ZGA was tolerated by fibroblasts up to a concentration of 125 μm. Above that concentration, the rate of cell proliferation slowed down, and cell morphology was altered (data not shown).The addition of 100 μm ZGA to healthy control and CDG fibroblasts led to a moderate decrease in cellular cholesterol levels by 15 and 30%, respectively (Fig. 2). The effect of ZGA on glycosylation was determined by measuring cellular levels of Dol-P, Dol-P-Man, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored model protein, LLO, and NLO. The impact of ZGA on Dol-P levels was first addressed using healthy control fibroblasts. After labeling with the fluorochrome 9-anthryldiazomethane, Dol-P levels were quantitated after HPLC separation (21Haeuptle M.A. Hülsmeier A.J. Hennet T. Anal. Biochem. 2010; 396: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The resulting fluorescent HPLC profiles of untreated cells (Fig. 3A) and of cells treated with 100 μm ZGA for 72 h (Fig. 3B) were compared. The pattern of Dol-P species changed upon ZGA treatment, with the amount of the longer C100-Dol-P and C105-Dol-P species increasing in ZGA-treated fibroblasts (Fig. 3C). To address the effect of ZGA on various parameters of LLO biosynthesis in CDG, we chose fibroblasts with a deficiency of DPM1 (Dol-P-Man synthase-1) (24Imbach T. Schenk B. Schollen E. Burda P. Stutz A. Grunewald S. Bailie N.M. King M.D. Jaeken J. Matthijs G. Berger E.G. Aebi M. Hennet T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), which present low Dol-P-Man levels and an accumulation of the LLO Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man5 and the corresponding GlcNAc2Man5 glycan structure on glycoproteins. Dol-P-Man production was measured after labeling cells with [3H]Man. The [3H]Dol-P-Man pool determined in DPM1-deficient fibroblasts reached 65% of the levels measured in healthy control cells (Fig. 4). When DPM1-deficient fibroblasts were treated with 100 μm ZGA for 72 h, the [3H]Dol-P-Man levels increased by reaching 120% of normal values. Similarly, when healthy control fibroblasts were incubated with 100 μm ZGA, the levels of [3H]Dol-P-Man increased by 150% (Fig. 4). DPM1 deficiency leads to reduced cell-surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins because Dol-P-Man is required for the assembly of the GPI anchor (27Kinoshita T. Ohishi K. Takeda J. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Accordingly, low levels of the GPI-anchored protein CD59 have been detected on the cell surface of DPM1-deficient fibroblasts (24Imbach T. Schenk B. Schollen E. Burda P. Stutz A. Grunewald S. Bailie N.M. King M.D. Jaeken J. Matthijs G. Berger E.G. Aebi M. Hennet T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The addition of ZGA led to increased expression of CD59 in healthy control (Fig. 5A) and DPM1-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 5B) as monitored by flow cytometry. When DPM1-deficient fibroblasts were treated with 100 μm ZGA for 72 h, the cell-surface levels of CD59 returned to the levels observed in untreated control fibroblasts (Fig. 5C). A time course experiment showed that the ZGA effect was maximal by 72 h of treatment, whereas longer periods did not increase CD59 expression further (Fig. 5C). The effect on CD59 expression was also maximal upon application of ZGA at 100 μm, but changes were already visible with lower ZGA concentrations (Fig. 5D). The biosynthesis of the LLO Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 requires Dol as a carrier of the growing oligosaccharide and as a donor substrate for Dol-P-Man and Dol-P-Glc (7Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). In normal cells, only the complete LLO Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 could be detected (Fig. 6A). DPM1 deficiency led to the accumulation of the intermediate LLO Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man5 (Fig. 6C) (24Imbach T. Schenk B. Schollen E. Burda P. Stutz A. Grunewald S. Bailie N.M. King M.D. Jaeken J. Matthijs G. Berger E.G. Aebi M. Hennet T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28Kim S. Westphal V. Srikrishna G. Mehta D.P. Peterson S. Filiano J. Karnes P.S. Patterson M.C. Freeze H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The amount of this incomplete LLO could be reduced by treatment of DPM1-deficient fibroblasts with 100 μm ZGA. The ratio of the abnormal Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man5 peak to the mature Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 peak was decreased from 54 to 17% upon ZGA supplementation (Fig. 6D). By comparison, the addition of 100 μm ZGA to control fibroblasts did not influence the quality of the LLO profile (Fig. 6B). After transfer from LLO to proteins, the NLO GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 is trimmed by glucosidases and mannosidases in the endoplasmic reticulum (29Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). The analysis of NLO after [3H]Man labeling of control fibroblasts showed, as expected, GlcNAc2Man8, GlcNAc2Man9, and GlcNAc2Man9Glc1 as main oligosaccharide structures (Fig. 7A). In DPM1-deficient fibroblasts, several intermediary oligosaccharide structures ranging from GlcNAc2Man4 to GlcNAc2Man7 were found, whereas the normal oligosaccharides GlcNAc2Man8, GlcNAc2Man9, and GlcNAc2Man9Glc1 were under-represented (Fig. 7C). Although ZGA treatment did not affect the NLO profile of control fibroblasts (Fig. 7B), it decreased the occurrence of abnormal N-linked glycans GlcNAc2Man4–7 and increased the amounts of the normal NLO GlcNAc2Man8, GlcNAc2Man9, and GlcNAc2Man9Glc1 in DPM1-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 7D). In these cells, the ratio of the pathologic GlcNAc2Man5 peak to the normal GlcNAc2Man9 peak was 422%, and this ratio was decreased to 143% after the addition of ZGA (Fig. 7D). This normalization of the NLO profile demonstrated the beneficial effect of ZGA treatment on N-glycosylation. This study shows that treatment of human CDG fibroblasts with the squalene synthase inhibitor ZGA stimulated Dol-P biosynthesis and thereby improved the level of N-glycosylation under conditions of limited substrate availability as encountered in DPM1 deficiency. In addition, supplementation with ZGA resulted in normalization of the expression of the GPI-anchored protein CD59 on DPM1-deficient fibroblasts. Successful treatment of biosynthetic CDG is restricted so far to oral administration of Man to Man-P isomerase-deficient CDG patients (10Niehues R. Hasilik M. Alton G. Körner C. Schiebe-Sukumar M. Koch H.G. Zimmer K.P. Wu R. Harms E. Reiter K. von Figura K. Freeze H.H. Harms H.K. Marquardt T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Westphal V. Kjaergaard S. Davis J.A. Peterson S.M. Skovby F. Freeze H.H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The applied Man can be phosphorylated by hexokinase and allows functional bypassing of the defective isomerization of Fru-6-P to Man-6-P. In the group of Golgi-associated CDG, a deficiency of the Golgi GDP-Fuc transporter (SLC35C1-CDG or leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II) (30Lübke T. Marquardt T. Etzioni A. Hartmann E. von Figura K. Körner C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) can also be treated by simple supplementation of a monosaccharide. Oral Fuc administration induces the expression of fucosylated glycoproteins, and within short terms, the clinical symptoms of a SLC35C1-CDG patient can be relieved (12Marquardt T. Lühn K. Srikrishna G. Freeze H.H. Harms E. Vestweber D. Blood. 1999; 94: 3976-3985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a few elementary attempts have been conducted to treat PMM2 (phosphomannomutase-2) deficiency (PMM2-CDG), which forms by far the largest CDG subtype (31Freeze H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mutations in the PMM2 gene lead to disrupted conversion of Man-6-P to Man-1-P, which acts as precursor of GDP-Man (32Matthijs G. Schollen E. Pardon E. Veiga-Da-Cunha M. Jaeken J. Cassiman J.J. Van Schaftingen E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, Man-1-P is not able to diffuse through biological membranes, and a transport system does not exist. Thus, it needs chemical modification prior to direct administration to overcome this obstacle (33Eklund E.A. Merbouh N. Ichikawa M. Nishikawa A. Clima J.M. Dorman J.A. Norberg T. Freeze H.H. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Hardré R. Khaled A. Willemetz A. Dupré T. Moore S. Gravier-Pelletier C. Le Merrer Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Membrane-permeable Man-1-P analogs are successful in restoring LLO biosynthesis in CDG patient cells, but such prodrugs are toxic and very unstable and have to be applied in high concentrations (33Eklund E.A. Merbouh N. Ichikawa M. Nishikawa A. Clima J.M. Dorman J.A. Norberg T. Freeze H.H. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Shang and Lehrman (36Shang J. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9703-9712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) discovered a metformin-stimulated Man-specific transport activity in human fibroblasts. The resulting increased Man uptake was shown to be able to correct artificially induced defects in LLO biosynthesis and protein N-glycosylation in control and PMM2-CDG fibroblasts. However, the observation that the clinical phenotype of PMM2 deficiency cannot be treated with dietary Man, which is actually effective in cell models (31Freeze H.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1792: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), renders a therapeutic administration of metformin questionable. Our approach to increase Dol-P biosynthesis by inhibition of the squalene synthase offers a therapeutic perspective for inherited biosynthetic N-glycosylation defects featuring residual enzymatic activity. Conveniently, ZGA is well tolerated in animal experiments (37Baxter A. Fitzgerald B.J. Hutson J.L. McCarthy A.D. Motteram J.M. Ross B.C. Sapra M. Snowden M.A. Watson N.S. Williams R.J. Wright C. J.

Matthews M.L. Jarvis C. Nolan N.M. Belliveau P. Malloy M. Gandhi P. Clin. Ther. 2007; 29: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We could show that ZGA decreased cellular cholesterol levels, although only by 15–30%, indicating that membrane properties were likely unaltered due to this treatment. However, we cannot exclude an effect of the lowered cholesterol levels on the formation of glycolipid rafts, in which GPI-anchored proteins partition. Accordingly, the increased expression of the GPI-anchored protein CD59 observed in ZGA-treated cells could be caused by increased Dol-P availability and altered raft distribution. By contrast, the positive effects of ZGA supplementation on Dol-P-Man levels and LLO patterns in DPM1-CDG fibroblasts are unlikely to be related to decreased cholesterol biosynthesis because the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is low in cholesterol levels (40Liscum L. Underwood K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15443-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the effects of ZGA on protein modifications, such as farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, have not been investigated, so we cannot dismiss an impact of such modifications on the N-glycosylation pathway at this stage. This study was based on fibroblasts deficient in DPM1 because this form of CDG shows several measurable abnormalities along the biosynthesis of N-glycans and GPI-anchored proteins. By contrast, deficiency of PMM2, which represents the largest group of CDG cases (6Haeuptle M.A. Hennet T. Hum. Mutat. 2009; 30: 1628-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), does not feature accumulating LLO intermediates. Consequently, incomplete oligosaccharides on glycoproteins are usually not encountered in PMM2 deficiency. However, the up-regulation of Dol-P-dependent substrates by ZGA may be beneficial in normalizing the glycosylation disorders caused by deficiency of glycosyltransferases catalyzing the attachment of the last four Man and three Glc residues of the LLO precursor (7Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). Over the last decade, knock-out mouse models for PMM2, Man-P isomerase, and DPAGT1 deficiency have been generated (41DeRossi C. Bode L. Eklund E.A. Zhang F. Davis J.A. Westphal V. Wang L.

Biol. 2006; 26: 5615-5620Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These works clearly showed that disruption of LLO biosynthesis leads to early embryonic lethality. In this context, it would be interesting to investigate whether the embryonic lethality of the homozygotes could be delayed to a later stage of development by treating pregnant heterozygous mice with ZGA according to Keller (15Keller R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, the generation of viable CDG mouse models, e.g. by introduction of selected point mutations, would allow detailed analysis of organ-specific effects of ZGA in the context of inherited N-glycosylation deficiencies. This seems to be of particular interest considering that Keller reported an enormous effect of ZGA on Dol and Dol-P pools in rat livers, but not in other organs, such as brain, kidney, intestine, and testis (15Keller R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which was similarly observed in different brain cells (44Crick D.C. Suders J. Kluthe C.M. Andres D.A. Waechter C.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Subcutaneously administered ZGA might preferentially be taken up by mammalian livers via a specific hepatic transport mechanism, which was likewise proposed in other studies (37Baxter A. Fitzgerald B.J. Hutson J.L. McCarthy A.D. Motteram J.M. Ross B.C. Sapra M. Snowden M.A. Watson N.S. Williams R.J. Wright C. J. Biol.

Martin I. Pelaez F. Diez M.T. Alberts A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Considering the frequent impairment of liver function in CDG patients (8Leroy J.G. Pediatr. Res. 2006; 60: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the proposed hepatic transport system for ZGA would suggest that liver N-glycosylation may benefit from treatment with the compound. Along this line, it would be of interest to address the effect of ZGA supplementation in hepatic cell lines because fibroblasts do not represent suitable cell models to study glycoprotein secretion. The generation of hepatic cell lines with inactivated glycosylation genes will represent an opportunity to study the regulation of N-glycosylation by ZGA and similar compounds. In conclusion, this study suggests new perspectives in developing treatments of glycosylation deficiency by showing that manipulation of the dolichol biosynthesis pathway, as shown here by ZGA administration, represents a valid option. We are grateful to Merck for generously providing ZGA and to Eric G. Berger for critically reading the manuscript."

IntroductionTransition metals are essential for many important chemical processes in biological systems. Most of these metal-related processes occur by interactions with nucleic acids and proteins. Within the cell, metal ions can stabilize, destabilize, or modulate DNA and proteins by introducing conformational changes and by creating centers of activity. Although the use of metals as structural elements within the cell is well known, emerging evidence now recasts metals as signaling molecules able to activate critical cellular pathways. For example, metals such as iron, copper, and cobalt can produce reactive oxygen species that lead to the activation of redox-sensitive transcription factors including NF-κB, AP-1, and p53. Metals have also been suggested to affect the upstream regulatory components of the MAP kinase and the PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway (1Crouch P.J. Hung L.W. Adlard P.A. Cortes M. Lal V. Filiz G. Perez K.A. Nurjono M. Caragounis A. Du T. Laughton K. Volitakis I. Bush A.I. Li Q.X. Masters C.L. Cappai R. Cherny R.A. Donnelly P.S. White A.R. Barnham K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus the levels and regulation of metals in a cell can have a direct role on cell function and survival.Metal ions such as CoII and FeII can stimulate the expression of the neuroprotective protein Nedd4 family interacting protein 1 (Ndfip1) 4The abbreviations used are: Ndfip1Nedd4 family interacting protein 1DMT1divalent metal transporter 1CHXcycloheximideICP-MSinductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. in the brain (3Howitt J. Putz U. Lackovic J. Doan A. Dorstyn L. Cheng H. Yang B. Chan-Ling T. Silke J. Kumar S. Tan S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 15489-15494Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ndfip1 is a transmembrane protein that is localized to the Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles such as endosomes (4Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Putz U. Howitt J. Lackovic J. Foot N. Kumar S. Silke J. Tan S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32621-32627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Ndfip1 functions as an adaptor protein for the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin ligases that target proteins for both degradation and trafficking (4Harvey K.F. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Fotia A. Parton R.G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9307-9317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The metal-induced up-regulation of Ndfip1 results in the activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Ndfip1 recognizes and interacts with divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), this recruits the E3 ligase Nedd4–2 resulting in degradation of DMT1, preventing iron overload within the cell (3Howitt J. Putz U. Lackovic J. Doan A. Dorstyn L. Cheng H. Yang B. Chan-Ling T. Silke J. Kumar S. Tan S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 15489-15494Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Other targets for Ndfip1 have also been identified, including the transcription factor JunB that is regulated by Ndfip1 in association with the E3 ligase Itch (6Oliver P.M. Cao X. Worthen G.S. Shi P. Briones N. MacLeod M. White J. Kirby P. Kappler J. Marrack P. Yang B. Immunity. 2006; 25: 929-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the adult brain, Ndfip1 is endogenously present in cortical neurons at low levels, however it is up-regulated in a subset of neurons upon activation by injury or stress (7Sang Q. Kim M.H. Kumar S. Bye N. Morganti-Kossman M.C. Gunnersen J. Fuller S. Howitt J. Hyde L. Beissbarth T. Scott H.S. Silke J. Tan S.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7234-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Importantly, this up-regulation of Ndfip1 has been shown to be neuroprotective, and neurons with up-regulated Ndfip1 do not undergo apoptosis.Whereas high levels of exogenous CoII and FeII are toxic to cells, our previous results show they also stimulate Ndfip1 via still unknown mechanisms. Barring the effects of metal toxicity, this finding introduces an opportunity to harness the capacity of metal ions to up-regulate Ndfip1 for neuroprotective purposes. In the present study, we investigate the utility of non-toxic metal complexes for controlled intracellular delivery of cobalt to stimulate Ndfip1 expression. This was based on the premise that the reactivity of metal ions can be modulated by the formation of coordination complexes, with a complexed metal ion having remarkably different reactivity to the “free” metal ion or hydrated cation. The incorporation of metal ions into coordination complexes permits superior control over their reactivity, and minimizes unwanted interactions with other molecules (8Hambley T.W. Dalton Trans. 2007; : 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the coordination of metal ions to ligands permits manipulation of their distribution and diffusion properties across cell membranes.Here we report the design and synthesis of metal complexes capable of delivering cobalt ions into the cell that are bioactive at far lower concentrations than the free metal salts. We demonstrate that this approach is capable of delivering low, but biologically effective levels of cobalt into the cell, resulting in Ndfip1 up-regulation with sustainable biological effects. As proof of concept, we show that cobalt-induced Ndfip1 up-regulation provides protection against cell death from noxious stimuli such as hydrogen peroxide. Our approach centers on the coordination of metal ions with suitable ligands as a powerful means of drug design that can overcome traditional hurdles of metal toxicity without compromising biological outcomes.DISCUSSIONThe regulation of protein expression in the cell is essential not only for normal homeostasis but also critical at times of stress when cells are challenged by adverse environments. Here we report a novel application of cobalt metal complexes to up-regulate protein expression of Ndfip1, a known neuroprotectant (3Howitt J. Putz U. Lackovic J. Doan A. Dorstyn L. Cheng H. Yang B. Chan-Ling T. Silke J. Kumar S. Tan S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 15489-15494Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Sang Q. Kim M.H. Kumar S. Bye N. Morganti-Kossman M.C.

The designed compounds were effective at micromolar levels in their ability to up-regulate Ndfip1 expression. We have previously demonstrated that Ndfip1 can be up-regulated in response to metal-induced stress from iron and cobalt exposure, and the up-regulation is effective in protecting neurons from metal toxicity (3Howitt J. Putz U. Lackovic J. Doan A. Dorstyn L. Cheng H. Yang B. Chan-Ling T. Silke J. Kumar S. Tan S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 15489-15494Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). How this is achieved remains unclear, but one possibility is ubiquitin-mediated degradation of harmful proteins following binding to Ndfip1 (24Mund T. Pelham H.R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 11429-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For example, a proposed mechanism for cell protection is binding of up-regulated Ndfip1 to the metal transport protein DMT1, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome, thereby limiting further metal entry (3Howitt J. Putz U. Lackovic J. Doan A. Dorstyn L. Cheng H. Yang B. Chan-Ling T. Silke J. Kumar S. Tan S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 15489-15494Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This suggests that manipulating intracellular levels of metal ions within subtoxic thresholds can control Ndfip1 expression, providing leverage to intracellular events lying downstream of Ndfip1 activity. However, a key challenge in activating Ndfip1 levels is the high concentration (and toxic levels) of metal ions required for up-regulation. Therefore, a novel aspect of the present work is the exploitation of relatively benign metal complexes for cellular entry leading to metal ion release under the reducing conditions present within the cell. This approach is based on cobalt having an inert higher oxidation state CoIII and a less stable lower oxidation state, CoII. Complexes have been designed to be neutral, membrane permeable and yet kinetically inert to substitution in their CoIII oxidation state. Once inside the cell, complexes are reduced to the corresponding CoII complexes that are substitutionally labile and as a consequence release bioactive CoII.The success of this Trojan horse approach hinges not only on effective delivery of biologically inert CoIII metal complexes into the cell, but also demonstration that once inside the cell, the complexes are converted into biologically active CoII. Evidence in support of this was obtained using cyclic voltammetry and electronic absorption measurements showing that the CoIII metal complexes are susceptible to reduction by intracellular reductants to the labile CoII oxidation state. Additional evidence of metal release was provided by a fluorescence quenching assay to directly monitor the release of CoII (21Foot N.J. Dalton H.E. Shearwin-Whyatt L.M. Dorstyn L. Tan S.S. Yang B. Kumar S. Blood. 2008; 112: 4268-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Of the three complexes under study, complex C3 showed the highest rate of calcein fluorescene quenching, suggesting that C3 has a greater rate of CoII release. The greater potency of complex C3 is most likely related to its design involving ethyl substituents, rendering it more membrane permeable, or alternatively, more susceptible to reduction once inside the cell. As only CoII is capable of quenching the calcein fluorescence the data confirms that dissociation of the metal from the ligands inside the cell allows for the release of bioavailable CoII.Ndfip1 up-regulation by complex C3 is biologically meaningful, as demonstrated by its ability to protect cultured cells from death following exposure to hydrogen peroxide in vitro. The degree of protection is comparable to the effect observed within cells engineered to overexpress Ndfip1 by genetic means (3Howitt J. Putz U. Lackovic J. Doan A. Dorstyn L. Cheng H. Yang B. Chan-Ling T. Silke J. Kumar S. Tan S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 15489-15494Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We found that following stereotaxic injection of complex C3 into the cortex, Ndfip1 was up-regulated in neurons situated over an area ∼600 μm2 adjacent the injection site, suggesting its capacity to function in vivo. This effect was also elicited by high concentrations of the CoCl2 salt, suggesting that complex C3 is equally effective in perfusing the cell matrix as the free salt. Currently it is unclear whether complex C3 has the capability to remain stable and travel through intercellular spaces to activate neurons further from the injection site.A further advance in using the present approach is the low (micromolar) concentrations of cobalt complexes required for generating a biological effect when compared with the use of simple metal salts such as CoCl2. This is related to the high efficiency of cobalt complex uptake followed by complex reduction inside the cell releasing bioavailable CoII. We found this to be the case for all three complexes tested, which despite subtle differences in their design, are capable of Ndfip1 up-regulation at 1 μm concentration, compared with 200 μm for CoCl2. Their effectiveness at micromolar concentrations presents significant therapeutic potential without the side effects of metal toxicity. Our findings also have strong implications for the current use of high (200–500 μm) levels of CoCl2 for experimental modeling of hypoxia (25Choi J.H. Cho H.K. Choi Y.H. Cheong J.H. Biochem. J. 2009; 424: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Björklund O. Shang M. Tonazzini I. Daré E. Fredholm B.B. Eur. J.

Lett. 2008; 441: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In those studies it is frequently assumed that cobalt ions simulate hypoxic stress by direct activation of the promoter elements of HIF1-α gene or by redox activity of excess CoII causing reactive oxygen species production. By contrast the current study demonstrates that cobalt complexes C1-3 at concentrations of 10 μm, where higher levels of the metal are entering the cell compared with CoCl2 incubation, do not upregulate the stress reporter protein HSP70 or the hypoxia-stimulated protein HIF1-α (28Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar, 29Aït-Aïssa S. Porcher J. Arrigo A. Lambré C. Toxicology. 2000; 145: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These results suggest that unlike treatment with CoCl2, the up-regulation of Ndfip1 using cobalt complexes C1-3 is unlikely to be the result of a general cell stress response. It can also been inferred from the results that activation of HIF1-α or indeed HSP70 requires metal entry via a transporter on the cell surface for effective response. Significantly, these findings open up new opportunities for studying how cobalt ions cause cellular hypoxic stress and how cells are able to sense their surrounding environment.The potential for cobalt coordination complexes as therapeutic agents has previously been investigated by others (30Hall Matthew D. Failes Timothy W. Yamamoto N. Hambley Trevor W. Dalton Trans. 2007; : 3983-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 31Hambley T.W. Science. 2007; 318: 1392-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that in those complexes, the metal ion plays the role of a carrier and provides an inert framework for transportation of a cytotoxic agent, such as nitrogen mustards, but performs no direct action in the biological system. In the case of nitrogen mustards the formation of a coordination bond between the CoIII ion and a nucleophilic amine or oxygen masks the cytotoxicity of the compound and allows for bioreductive activation. In contrast, we synthesized CoIII complexes designed to deliver CoII in the cellular environment. The complexes presented here employ one tetradentate dianionic ligand and one monoanionic bidentate ligand resulting in the formation of stable, neutral, lipophilic six coordinate CoIII complexes. The tetradentate system are well known ligands derived from the condensation of 1,2-diaminoethane with substituted salicaldehydes to give proligands often given the trivial name salenH2. Complex C1 has previously been synthesized with unknown biological activity, but complexes C2 and C3 are novel. Complexes C2 and C3 bear methyl/ethyl substituents in the 2-position of the phenol ring to influence their lipophilicity and cellular uptake. All three complexes are membrane permeable, shown by measuring intracellular cobalt levels using ICP-mass spectrometry of treated SH-SY5Y cells. However complex C3 was observed to have properties that allow for a greater amount and rate of cobalt entry.The present work may be interpreted in the wider context of using metal ions for therapeutic purposes (2Donnelly P.S.

For example, copper-bis(thiosemicarbazone) complexes such as CuII(gtsm) can cross the blood-brain barrier and increase cellular metal ion bioavailability, leading to inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which ultimately results in degradation of Aβ and tau phosphorylation (1Crouch P.J.

In the present study, direct introduction of cobalt complex C3 into the adult mouse brain was efficient in increasing neuronal levels of Ndfip1. We propose that targeted delivery of such metals allows for the activation of intracellular pathways and have demonstrated this through the up-regulation of the neuroprotective protein Ndfip1.

The metal-induced up-regulation of Ndfip1 results in the activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Ndfip1 recognizes and interacts with divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), this recruits the E3 ligase Nedd4–2 resulting in degradation of DMT1, preventing iron overload within the cell (3Howitt J. Putz U. Lackovic J. Doan A. Dorstyn L. Cheng H. Yang B. Chan-Ling T. Silke J. Kumar S. Tan S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 15489-15494Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Other targets for Ndfip1 have also been identified, including the transcription factor JunB that is regulated by Ndfip1 in association with the E3 ligase Itch (6Oliver P.M. Cao X. Worthen G.S. Shi P.

In the adult brain, Ndfip1 is endogenously present in cortical neurons at low levels, however it is up-regulated in a subset of neurons upon activation by injury or stress (7Sang Q. Kim M.H. Kumar S. Bye N. Morganti-Kossman M.C. Gunnersen J. Fuller S. Howitt J. Hyde L. Beissbarth T. Scott H.S. Silke J. Tan S.S. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7234-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Importantly, this up-regulation of Ndfip1 has been shown to be neuroprotective, and neurons with up-regulated Ndfip1 do not undergo apoptosis.Whereas high levels of exogenous CoII and FeII are toxic to cells, our previous results show they also stimulate Ndfip1 via still unknown mechanisms. Barring the effects of metal toxicity, this finding introduces an opportunity to harness the capacity of metal ions to up-regulate Ndfip1 for neuroprotective purposes. In the present study, we investigate the utility of non-toxic metal complexes for controlled intracellular delivery of cobalt to stimulate Ndfip1 expression. This was based on the premise that the reactivity of metal ions can be modulated by the formation of coordination complexes, with a complexed metal ion having remarkably different reactivity to the “free” metal ion or hydrated cation. The incorporation of metal ions into coordination complexes permits superior control over their reactivity, and minimizes unwanted interactions with other molecules (8Hambley T.W. Dalton Trans. 2007; : 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the coordination of metal ions to ligands permits manipulation of their distribution and diffusion properties across cell membranes.Here we report the design and synthesis of metal complexes capable of delivering cobalt ions into the cell that are bioactive at far lower concentrations than the free metal salts. We demonstrate that this approach is capable of delivering low, but biologically effective levels of cobalt into the cell, resulting in Ndfip1 up-regulation with sustainable biological effects. As proof of concept, we show that cobalt-induced Ndfip1 up-regulation provides protection against cell death from noxious stimuli such as hydrogen peroxide. Our approach centers on the coordination of metal ions with suitable ligands as a powerful means of drug design that can overcome traditional hurdles of metal toxicity without compromising biological outcomes."

At 25 μM (∼EC(50)), Aza reduced total body sterol by 82.5%, confirming sterol depletion. Aza (25 μM) treatment of wild-type (N2) C. elegans grown in sitosterol (5 μg/ml) reduced MLS by 35%. Similar results were obtained for the stress-related mutants daf-16(mu86) and gas-1(fc21). Unexpectedly, Aza had essentially no effect on MLS in the stress-resistant daf-2(e1370) or mitochondrial complex II mutant mev-1(kn1) strains, indicating that Aza may target both insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) and mitochondrial complex II. Aza increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels 2.7-fold in N2 worms, but did not affect ROS production by mev-1(kn1), suggesting a direct link between Aza treatment and mitochondrial ROS production. Moreover, expression of the stress-response transcription factor SKN-1 was decreased in amphid neurons by Aza and that of DAF-28 was increased when DAF-6 was involved, contributing to lifespan reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2065704768,"SGLT1 is a sodium/glucose cotransporter that moves two Na+ ions with each glucose molecule per cycle. SGLT3 proteins belong to the same family and are described as glucose sensors rather than glucose transporters. Thus, human SGLT3 (hSGLT3) does not transport sugar, but extracellular glucose depolarizes the cell in which it is expressed.

The presence of glutamine at residue 457 increased the apparent Na+ and sugar affinities, whereas glutamate decreased the apparent Na+ affinity. Moreover, glutamate transported more cations per sugar molecule than the wild type protein. We propose a model where cations are released intracellularly without the release of sugar from an intermediate state.

Members of the SLC5 cotransporter family present highly diverse functions. They are capable of cotransporting Na+ with glucose (SGLT1 and SGLT2), with myoinositol (SMIT), with iodide (NIS), or with choline (CHT), among other substrates (reviewed in Ref. 1Wright E.M. Turk E. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In fact, there is one family member, human SGLT3, that is not a transporter but is a glucose sensor (2Diez-Sampedro A. Hirayama B.A. Osswald C. Gorboulev V. Baumgarten K. Volk C. Wright E.M. Koepsell H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11753-11758Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 3Bianchi L.

One residue that directly interacts with the sugar is glutamine 428, which is equivalent to amino acid 457 in mammalian SGLT proteins. Notably, the identity of the amino acid at position 457 in human SGLT1 (hSGLT1) has proven to have a dramatic effect on the function of the protein. Structure-function studies on hSGLT1 suggest that residue 457 interacts with sugar (6Díez-Sampedro A. Wright E.M. Hirayama B.A. J. Biol.

The crystal structure of vSGLT did not reveal the position of the single Na+-binding site. SGLT1 and other transporters like LeuT, and presumably SGLT3, have two Na+-binding sites. Based on structural homology to LeuT, whose two Na+-binding sites were identified, Na1 and Na2 (9Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), a Na+-binding site in vSGLT ∼ 10 Å away from the sugar binding site was proposed and corresponds to Na2 in LeuT (5Faham S.

The location of the other Na+ binding site in SGLT has not been identified, but it may correspond to Na1 in LeuT. These Na+-binding sites are likely to be conserved in SGLT1 and SGLT3 proteins. Despite ∼70% amino acid identity between hSGLT3 and hSGLT1, there are significant differences in their function, besides the inability of hSGLT3 to transport sugar. hSGLT3 also has a weaker apparent glucose affinity, no visible pre-steady-state currents and a different tissue distribution than SGLT1 (2Diez-Sampedro A. Hirayama B.A. Osswald C. Gorboulev V. Baumgarten K. Volk C. Wright E.M. Koepsell H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11753-11758Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 10Voss A.A.

In terms of amino acid sequence, all SGLT1 and SGLT2 proteins have a glutamine at residue 457, whereas most SGLT3 proteins have a glutamate. There are two exceptions, glycine in mouse SGLT3b and serine in rat SGLT3b (Fig. 1). Because of the strict conservation of amino acid 457 among the SGLT1 and SGLT2 glucose transporters and the difference with the SGLT3 glucose sensors, we explored whether the identity of this residue plays a major role in the differences in function between the different proteins. Specifically, we looked at the effect of modifying this residue in mSGLT3b. We sought to learn whether the identity of residue 457 in mSGLT3b would lead to significant changes in function. We made two mutations, G457Q-mSGLT3b and G457E-mSGLT3b, to recapitulate the residue in SGLT1 and human SGLT3, respectively. We then compared the characteristics of each of the mutants with the wild type protein. We found that the mutations changed the apparent affinity for sugar, as expected for being part of the sugar binding site, and surprisingly, also changed the apparent affinity of Na+. In addition, we found that residue 457 affects the charge:sugar cotransport ratio, indicating that it contributes to the uncoupled phenotype that occurs in SGLT3. We propose a mechanism for SGLT that explains the uncoupled transport that occurs in wild type mSGLT3b, G457E, and also in human SGLT3. Mouse SGLT3b cDNA in pGH19 was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: G457E-mSGLT3b (G457E-sense, 5′-CTCTTCCACTATATTGAGTCAGTTTCTAGCTAC-3′ and G457E -antisense, 5′-GTAGCTAGAAACTGACTCAATAT-AGTGGAAGAG-3′) and G457Q-mSGLT3b (G457Q-sense, 5′-CTCTTCCACTATATTCAGTCAGTTTCTAGCTAC-3′ and G457Q-antisense, 5′-GTAGCTAGAAACTGACTGAATATAGTGGAAGAG-3′. The underlined letters represent the nucleotides changed. The gene was sequenced from start to stop codon to ensure that only the desired mutation was present. Plasmids containing the wild type and mutant cDNAs were linearized with XhoI and RNAs were transcribed and capped in vitro using the T7 RNA promoter (MEGAscript kit, Ambion). X. laevis oocytes were injected with 50 ng of cRNA encoding each protein. Oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in OR2 supplemented with penicillin (10,000 units/ml)/streptomycin (10 mg/ml) for 5–8 days before experiments. Electrophysiology experiments were performed using a two-electrode voltage clamp with a rapid perfusion chamber. Oocytes were bathed in Na+ solution composed of the following: 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, and in Na+-free solution, with choline chloride replacing NaCl. To measure sugar-induced current, the membrane potential was held at −50 mV and stepped for 100 ms from −150 mV to +50 mV or to +110 mV in 20-mV increments. The sugar-dependent current was defined as the difference between the current recorded in sugar and the previous record in Na+ solution alone. Experiments were controlled, and data were acquired using pClamp software (Axon Instruments). Apparent Na+ affinity (K0.5Na+) was calculated by recording currents in 150 mm αM-Glc and in progressively increasing Na+ concentrations (0–100 mm). Apparent sugar affinity (K0.5) was obtained in 100 mm Na+ with increasing sugar concentrations (0–150 mm). The steady-state currents at each membrane potential were fit to the following equation: I = Imax[S]n/(K0.5n + [S]n), where Imax is the maximal current, [S] is the substrate concentration, K0.5 is the substrate concentration for one-half Imax, and n is the Hill coefficient. For fitting of sugar dose response curves, n was set to 1. The “off” currents were fit with double exponentials, and the membrane capacitive component obtained from the fit was subtracted from the current record, leaving the currents attributable to the transporter. The presteady-state transient charge, Q, was determined by integration of this transient off current with time, and the distribution of the charge moved as a function of membrane voltage (V) was calculated by fitting the data with the Boltzmann equation: (Q − Qhyp)/Qmax = 1/(1 + exp(z(V − V0.5)F/RT)), where Qmax = Qdep − Qhyp (Qdep and Qhyp are Q at depolarizing and hyperpolarizing limits, respectively), F is Faraday's constant, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. V0.5 is the membrane potential where there is 50% charge transfer, and z is the apparent valence of movable charge. Fits of data with equations were performed using SigmaPlot (version 9.0). Oocytes were incubated in 50 μm, 1 mm, or 6 mm of αM-Glc (as indicated in each experiment) with traces of [14C]αM-Glc for 1 h in Na+ solution or in Na+-free solution. After the incubation, the oocytes were washed with cold Na+-free solution and individually solubilized. Sugar uptake was determined by using a scintillation counter. Sugar uptake in noninjected oocytes from the same batch of oocytes was used as control. Oocytes clamped at −90 mV were perfused with 5 mm αM-Glc with traces of radioactive αM-Glc. In each oocyte, the sugar-induced current was recorded during the incubation. After the incubation, the oocyte was removed from the chamber, washed, and solubilized, and radioactive sugar uptake was determined by scintillation counting. αM-Glc uptake into noninjected oocytes from the same batch was used to correct for background endogenous uptake. Sugar-induced current was obtained as the difference between baseline and αM-Glc-induced current and integrated over the time course of the experiment. Then, the current was converted to its molar equivalent by using Faraday's constant as described previously (11Díez-Sampedro A. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Hirayama B.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F278-F282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WT-mSGLT3b and the mutant proteins G457E and G457Q were expressed in oocytes to test for differences in their function. First, we tested whether glucose induced any current in the proteins. The oocytes were clamped at −50 mV and glucose-induced currents were recorded at different voltages, ranging from −150 to +50 mV. Fig. 2 shows examples of induced currents recorded from WT-mSGLT3b (Fig. 2B), G457E (Fig. 2C), and G457Q (Fig. 2D) at those voltages, bathed in different glucose concentrations. The large currents that some of the glucose concentrations induced illustrate that there was robust expression of the three different clones in the oocytes. In addition, although the currents at any given sugar concentration through WT-mSGLT3b were approximately ohmic, there appeared to be increased voltage dependence in G457Q, and more dramatically in G457E, indicating that the nature of the residue at 457 affects the voltage dependence of the protein. Because a mutation at amino acid 457 in human SGLT1 can lead to the disease glucose-galactose malabsorption due to the lack of sugar transport (7Wright E.M. Turk E. Martin M.G. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 36: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8Lam J.T. Martín M.G. Turk E. Hirayama B.A. Bosshard N.U. Steinmann B. Wright E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1453: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the equivalent residue already present in the human SGLT3 appears to prevent glucose transport (3Bianchi L. Díez-Sampedro A. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we tested whether the mSGLT3b mutants have altered glucose transport properties. Fig. 3 shows that in the presence of 50 μm αM-Glc for 1 h, αM-Glc transport increased ∼4-fold in G457Q (36 ± 5 pmol; n = 4) compared with WT-mSGLT3b (9 ± 0.2 pmol; n = 4) but was reduced to noninjected control levels (2.5 ± 0.2 pmol; n = 4) in G457E (2 ± 0.1 pmol; n = 4). Additionally, we found that sugar uptake in WT-mSGLT3b and G457Q was Na+-dependent, as removal of Na+ from the bath abolished uptake. These results indicate that in 50 μm αM-Glc, glutamine at residue 457 in mSGLT3b increases the sugar transport, whereas glutamate decreases sugar transport. Apparent sugar affinities (K0.5) were calculated for WT-mSGLT3b and for the mutants G457E and G457Q. Table 1 presents the means of the apparent affinities for glucose and αM-Glc measured at −90 mV. The apparent affinities of WT-mSGLT3b for αM-Glc and glucose were 62 ± 5 mm (n = 5) and 77 ± 3 mm (n = 6), respectively. These apparent sugar affinities are low compared with SGLT1 or SGLT2 but agree with the previously published mSGLT3b sugar affinities (12Aljure O. Díez-Sampedro A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 299: C58-C65Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). G457E had very similar apparent sugar affinities to WT-mSGLT3b: K0.5 for αM-Glc was 65 ± 0.1 mm (n = 2), and K0.5 for glucose was 59 ± 4 mm (n = 4). However, when residue 457 was a glutamine, the apparent affinities were higher: 9 ± 0.6 mm (n = 4) and 6 ± 0.2 mm (n = 4) for αM-Glc and glucose, respectively. It was previously reported that the apparent affinity of WT-mSGLT3b for 6-deoxyglucose (6DO-Glc) is stronger than for glucose (12Aljure O. Díez-Sampedro A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 299: C58-C65Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Notably, we found here that the apparent affinity of G457Q for 6DO-Glc (4 ± 0.3 mm) was not significantly different than for glucose (Table 1). Thus, when residue 457 is glycine (WT) the −OH group of C6 of the pyranose ring prevents the sugar from binding strongly, but when it is glutamine (G457Q), the hydroxyl group does not affect the sugar binding, and glucose and 6DO-Glc interact strongly and similarly. This is interesting because the crystal structure of vSGLT shows that there is a direct interaction between the residue equivalent to the mammalian 457, Gln428 in vibrio, and the hydroxyl group of the C6 of the galactose (Fig. 4) (5Faham S. Watanabe A. Besserer G.M. Cascio D. Specht A. Hirayama B.A. Wright E.M. Abramson J. Science. 2008; 321: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). When the residue is short (glycine) the interaction is better when there is no −OH group at C6, and, when the residue is longer (glutamine) the interaction is not affected if there is no −OH group. Thus, the difference in apparent affinities between glucose and 6DO-Glc in mSGLT3b and G457Q could be due to allosteric alteration of the binding site, to differences in formation of hydrogen bonds, or both.TABLE 1Apparent affinities in mm for glucose and αM-Glc for WT-mSGLT3b, G457E, and G457Q, measured at −90 mV in oocytesSugarWT-mSGLT3bG457EG457QGlucose77 ± 359 ± 46 ± 0.2αM-Glc62 ± 565 ± 0.19 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab Fig. 5 shows the K0.5 values for glucose at different voltages in individual oocytes expressing each of the three proteins, demonstrating that WT-mSGLT3b and G457E had the same apparent affinity at all the voltages tested, whereas G457Q resulted in stronger apparent affinity. We next calculated the apparent Na+ affinity, K0.5Na+, for G457Q and G457E. The K0.5Na+ for WT-mSGLT3b is ∼ 20 mm (12Aljure O. Díez-Sampedro A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 299: C58-C65Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although the residue analogous to 457 in vSGLT is known to interact directly with the sugar molecule (5Faham S. Watanabe A. Besserer G.M. Cascio D. Specht A. Hirayama B.A. Wright E.M. Abramson J. Science. 2008; 321: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), we found that mutations at this residue in mSGLT3b affected the apparent affinity for Na+. Fig. 6A shows sugar-induced currents at different Na+ concentrations from WT-mSGLT3b, G457Q, and G457E at −50 mV. The lowest apparent Na+ affinity belonged to G457E and the highest to G457Q, whereas WT-mSGLT3b had an intermediate apparent affinity. We also calculated these apparent Na+ affinities across a range of voltages (Fig. 6B) and found that the apparent affinity for G457Q ranged from 11 ± 2 mm at −150 mV to 21 ± 4 mm at −10 mV (data are the mean ± S.E. of four different experiments). Comparing these results with the WT-mSGLT3b apparent affinities (data from Ref. 12Aljure O. Díez-Sampedro A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 299: C58-C65Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the apparent affinity of Na+ for G457Q is between two to three times higher than for WT-mSGLT3b. This change may be due to higher sugar affinity as K0.5Na+ is measured by sugar-induced currents at different [Na+]. For G457E-mSGLT3b, it was not possible to calculate the K0.5Na+ at voltages between −150 and −70 mV because the currents did not saturate and could not be accurately fit to a Hill equation. The data obtained at more depolarizing voltages indicated that the K0.5Na+ values are higher than the K0.5Na+ obtained for the WT-mSGLT3b protein, and the K0.5Na+ values are even higher at hyperpolarizing voltages. Because the apparent sugar affinity was higher in G457Q than in WT-mSGLT3b, the differences shown in K0.5Na+ may be an indirect effect of the differences in sugar affinity. However, the apparent sugar affinities for WT-mSGLT3b and G457E were similar; thus, the differences observed between their K0.5Na+ values were not due to different sugar affinities. Because the apparent affinities of sugar were higher for G457Q than for G457E and WT-mSGLT3b, we thought this might underlie the large difference we observed in the magnitude of sugar uptake between them (Fig. 3). Therefore, we repeated the sugar transport experiments at sugar concentrations that were ∼10% of the K0.5 of each of the respective proteins (Fig. 7). In these experiments, the external sugar concentrations were 6 mm for WT-mSGLT3b and G457E, and 1 mm for G457Q. At these concentrations, the sugar transport was similar in the WT-mSGLT3b and in G457Q-expressing oocytes. These data, compared with the data obtained with 50 μm sugar concentration, clearly show that apparent sugar affinities account for the differences in amount of sugar uptake within these transporters when performing the experiment with low concentrations of the substrate (Fig. 3) in WT-mSGLT3b and G457Q. However, the transport for G457E was still low, only ∼15% that of WT-mSGLT3b, indicating that G457E has less sugar transport capability. The question remains as to why the sugar transport in G457E was so much lower than the WT-mSGLT3b. We therefore analyzed the mutant G457E in more depth. We analyzed presteady-state currents of WT-mSGLT3b, G457Q, and G457E. Presteady-state currents represent partial reactions of the transport cycle that are voltage-dependent. By analyzing those currents, we obtained information on the distribution of the transporter in different states. Fig. 8A shows currents of one G457E-expressing oocyte in the presence of Na+ and without sugar. The figure shows the currents of an oocyte clamped at −50 mV and when the voltage was jumped from −150 to +50 mV in +20-mV increments. WT-mSGLT3b, G457E, and G457Q presteady-state currents were analyzed to obtain the charge transfer (Q) at each voltage and to fit those data with a Boltzmann equation. Charge/voltage obtained for G457E is presented in Fig. 8B (inverted triangle). For comparison, we also plotted data from WT-mSGLT3b to show how G457E data were shifted to depolarizing voltages. The same Q/V plot and analysis were done with G457Q (data not shown). Data obtained from the fit to the Boltzmann equation (dotted line) in G457E and G457Q along with the data for WT-mSGLT3b (from Ref. 12Aljure O. Díez-Sampedro A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 299: C58-C65Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) are presented in Table 2. V0.5 in G457E was +36 mV, whereas in G457Q, it was +3 mV, and this shift in V0.5 is even greater when we compare it with the V0.5 of WT-mSGLT3b, −17 mV. These data indicate that at the same membrane potential, the three proteins have different distributions among the different states of the protein cycle.TABLE 2Summary of kinetic parametersWT-mSGLT3bG457EG457QImax (nA)1800 ± 2501200 ± 1301600 ± 330Qmax (nC)25 ± 417 ± 225 ± 4V0.5 (mV)−17 ± 136 ± 23.3 ± 4Turnover (cycles sec−1)75 ± 3.476 ± 864 ± 6 Open table in a new tab Apart from the V0.5, the other kinetic parameters obtained from analyzing the presteady-state currents were similar in the three proteins. Turnover numbers, calculated as Imax divided by Qmax (as previously described for other SGLT proteins (13Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21016-21020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were 76, 64, and 75 cycles per second in G457E, G457Q, and WT-mSGLT3b respectively, and the Qmax were 17, 25, and 25 nC. These Qmax values indicate that the transport levels are comparable and that decreased expression levels do not explain the lower sugar uptake in G457E. Fig. 8C shows the average sugar-induced current in G457E and WT-mSGLT3b expressing oocytes (mean ± S.E.). At −150 mV, the sugar-induced current in G457E was the same as in WT-mSGLT3b. However, at more depolarizing voltages, the induced currents were lower in G457E than in the WT-mSGLT3b protein. These lower currents could explain, at least partially, why the sugar transport in G457E expressing oocytes is lower than in WT-mSGLT3b because the resting potential of the expressing oocytes is between −30 and −50 mV, and Fig. 7 represents sugar transport measured in nonclamped oocytes. Finally, we tested the ratio of charge to sugar transport (Fig. 8D). SGLT1 transports two sodium ions with each sugar (14Mackenzie B. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The WT-mSGLT3b ratio was 2.6 charges per sugar molecule (data from Ref. 12Aljure O. Díez-Sampedro A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 299: C58-C65Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), showing that this transport was not as tightly coupled as in SGLT1. In G457E, we found that charge:sugar transport was even more uncoupled, with an average of 4.5 charges per sugar molecule. Thus, the same magnitude of sugar-induced current in G457E as in WT-mSGLT3b will correspond with less sugar transported by G457E compared with WT-mSGLT3b. Thus, the lower rate of sugar transport observed in G457E (Fig. 7) can be due to either the decreased sugar-induced currents at resting potentials (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8C), to the uncoupled charge:sugar transport phenotype (Fig. 8D), or to a combination of both. The goal of this work was to understand the functional differences between SGLT1 and SGLT3. The advantage of studying mSGLT3b instead of human SGLT3 is that we can analyze presteady-state currents and calculate the apparent affinities of Na+. Typical recordings of hSGLT3 do not show presteady-state currents (3Bianchi L. Díez-Sampedro A. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and, to date, the apparent Na+ affinity in hSGLT3 has not been resolved. We studied the mSGLT3b mutants G457E and G457Q, which recapitulate the amino acids at residue 457 in hSGLT3 and SGLT1, respectively. Thus, we investigated the modifications in apparent sugar and Na+ affinities, ability to transport sugar, the distribution of the protein in different states, and the charge-to-sugar stoichiometry to suggest a mechanistic model for current transport uncoupled from sugar transport. We found that G457E has lower apparent Na+ affinity than WT-mSGLT3b, whereas both have the same apparent sugar affinity. Can a different distribution of G457E between inward and outward facing states explain this lower Na+ affinity? A simplified six-state ordered kinetic model that described the states of SGLT1 was proposed earlier (15Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 63-79PubMed Google Scholar, 16Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Half of the states have the binding site of the protein facing the extracellular space (C1, C2, and C3 of Fig. 9) and half the intracellular space (C4, C5, and C6). By introducing glutamate at residue 457, we added an extra negative charge to an already voltage-dependent protein. Analyzing the presteady-state currents in G457E, we observed that the V0.5, the voltage at which the charge is equally distributed between inward and outward facing conformations, is more positive than in the WT-mSGLT3b protein (Fig. 8, A and B, and Table 2). This means that at physiological voltages a higher percentage of the protein will be facing out. The extra negative charge in the protein weakens the apparent affinity for Na+ while leaving the apparent sugar affinity unaffected. Hence, the favorable distribution of G457E toward the outward facing conformation compared with WT-mSGLT3b does not explain the weaker K0.5Na+ of the protein because that distribution would cause a stronger affinity. The introduction of a negative charge at 457 weakened the apparent affinity of Na+, whereas a neutral mutation (G457Q-mSGLT3b) significantly strengthened it (although this could be due to a higher glucose affinity in G457Q). In vSGLT, one Na+-binding site was proposed to be ∼8–10 Å from the bound sugar based on structural homology to LeuT. This would correspond with the Na2 site in LeuT. In vSGLT, the Na1 site was not detected, but in LeuT, the octahedral coordination for that Na1 includes one leucine carboxyl oxygen (4Abramson J. Wright E.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 5Faham S. Watanabe A. Besserer G.M. Cascio D. Specht A. Hirayama B.A. Wright E.M. Abramson J.

We found that glutamate at residue 457 lowered the apparent Na+ affinity. This suggests that mutations at 457 may change the geometry of a nearby Na+ binding site, Na2, but that residue 457 is not part of the Na+ binding site. However, we cannot rule the possibility that in SGLT3b one Na+ binds to the sugar, similarly to Na1 in LeuT, so that alteration of the sugar binding will directly affect that Na+ binding. According to the existing six-state kinetic model developed for SGLT1 (16Loo D.D. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 17Loo D.D. Hirayama B.A. Gallardo E.M. Lam J.T. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), empty outward facing proteins (C1) first bind two sodium ions (C2), then bind one sugar molecule (C3) and undergo a subsequent conformational change that transitions the protein from outward to inward facing (C4) where the ligands are released (C5 and C6) before returning to the outward facing empty conformation (C1). Among SGLT clones that transport with stoichiometries close to 2:1, all bind Na+ with apparent affinities in the 10–30 mm range (SGLT1 (14Mackenzie B. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), mSGLT3b (12Aljure O. Díez-Sampedro A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 299: C58-C65Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and pig SGLT3 (11Díez-Sampedro A. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Hirayama B.A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F278-F282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). In contrast, G457E had weaker Na+ affinity and an uncoupled stoichiometry 4.5:1 (Fig. 8D), whereas the apparent affinity of human SGLT3 for Na+ remains undetermined. Applying the six-state model to all SGLT proteins, one simple explanation for progressively more uncoupled stoichiometries is a greater fraction of proteins that undergo the C2–C5 transition, thereby releasing internal Na+, but without any sugar binding or transport. However, this explanation cannot account for uncoupled current in its entirety. In particular, in human SGLT3, the current is sugar dependent yet none of the protein appears to reach state C4. What then is the determinant of sugar transport or nontransport in SGLT proteins? The apparent affinity of sugar does not appear to determine sugar transport, as WT-mSGLT3b and G457Q transport equally well when the sugar concentration was normalized to their respective K0.5 values (Fig. 7). However, G457E, with the same apparent sugar affinity but lower Na+ affinity than WT-mSGLT3b, transports sugar less efficiently (Fig. 7) and more uncoupled from the charge transport (Fig. 8D). These data suggest that the ability or failure to transport sugar depends upon completion of the conformational change after sugar binding. In other transporters, the existence of intermediate states between C3 to C4 has been proposed (18Forrest L.R. Rudnick G. Physiology. 2009; 24: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In SGLT1, although intermediate states have been described between C6 and C1 (19Loo D.D. Hirayama B.A. Karakossian M.H. Meinild A.K. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 701-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), none has been proposed between C3 and C4. The order of release of Na+ and sugar by SGLT is not yet well established. Equilibrium simulations performed in vSGLT suggest that Na+ is released intracellularly very quickly and before the sugar (20Li J. Tajkhorshid E. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: L29-L31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, using molecular dynamics simulations in LeuT, it was proposed that one Na+ is released before the other Na+ and the substrate (21Shi L. Quick M. Zhao Y. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, in our proposed model for SGLT (Fig. 9), one Na+ is first released inside from an intermediate state (C3′) between C3 and C4, whereas sugar and the other Na+ are occluded. Then, there is a conformational change that exposes the occluded Na+ and sugar (C4) followed by their release (C5 and C6). Uncoupled stoichiometries could be explained by the transition from C3′ to C3′a, where the first Na+ is released but the conformational change to expose Na+ and sugar does not occur. The side chain at residue 457 may be responsible for preventing the progression (C3′a to C4) toward the conformation that favors intracellular release of the other Na+ and sugar; thus, the transporter goes back toward the outward-facing conformation (C3′a to C3′b to C3). In fact, it was recently proposed that charge and polarity of residue 457 affect the conformational changes that occur after Na+ and sugar binding (22Liu T. Krofchick D. Silverman M. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 748-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Human SGLT3, which transports ions but not sugar, would then be the most extreme manifestation of this failure to complete the translocation step, shifting the protein toward C3′a and with no protein completing the C3′a to C4 transition. An alternative explanation for the failure to complete C3′a to C4 transition could be due to the premature release of the Na+ when apparent Na+ affinity is low. In addition, our data do not differentiate whether only one or both Na+ ions are released during sugar-dependent ion leak. In conclusion, the nature of the side chain at amino acid 457 has an effect on the apparent sugar and Na+ affinities and, moreover, on the uncoupled charge transport. Sugar affinity is likely to be affected by a direct effect of the sugar binding site, but the Na+ affinity may be affected by allosterically altering the Na+ binding site. Uncoupled stoichiometries may reflect the existence of an intermediate state from which the protein can release one Na+. This must be followed by difficulties in progressing to states where the other Na+ and sugar can be released. The degree of uncoupling in transport would then be dependent on the energetic balance between transition to the fully inward facing state, where the other Na+ and sugar could be released, versus returning to an outward facing conformation. Addendum After initial review, an additional structure of vSGLT was released by Watanabe et al. (23Watanabe A. Choe S. Chaptal V. Rosenberg J.M. Wright E.M. Grabe M. Abramson J. Nature. 2010; 468: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) who independently proposed intracellular Na+ release from an intermediate state consistent with our results and proposed model.
