https://openalex.org/W4220965228,"Within the last 2 decades, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2) have caused two major outbreaks; yet, for reasons not fully understood, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been significantly more widespread than the 2003 SARS epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-1, despite striking similarities between these two viruses. The SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, both of which bind to host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, have been implied to be a potential source of their differential transmissibility. However, the mechanistic details of prefusion spike protein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 remain elusive at the molecular level. Here, we performed an extensive set of equilibrium and nonequilibrium microsecond-level all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike proteins to determine their differential dynamic behavior. Our results indicate that the active form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is more stable than that of SARS-CoV-1 and the energy barrier associated with the activation is higher in SARS-CoV-2. These results suggest that not only the receptor-binding domain but also other domains such as the N-terminal domain could play a crucial role in the differential binding behavior of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4221097653,"Macrophages are highly plastic cells that can polarize into functionally distinct subsets in vivo and in vitro in response to environmental signals. The development of protocols to model macrophage polarization in vitro greatly contributes to our understanding of macrophage biology. Macrophages are divided into two main groups: Pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (classically activated) and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages (alternatively activated), based on several key surface markers and the production of inflammatory mediators. However, the expression of these common macrophage polarization markers is greatly affected by the stimulation time used. Unfortunately, there is no consensus yet regarding the optimal stimulation times for particular macrophage polarization markers in in vitro experiments. This situation is problematic, (i) as analysing a particular marker at a suboptimal time point can lead to false-negative results, and (ii) as it clearly impedes the comparison of different studies. Using human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in vitro, we analysed how the expression of the main polarization markers for M1 (CD64, CD86, CXCL9, CXCL10, HLA-DR, IDO1, IL1β, IL12, TNF), M2a (CD200R, CD206, CCL17, CCL22, IL-10, TGM2), and M2c (CD163, IL-10, TGFβ) macrophages changes over time at mRNA and protein levels. Our data establish the most appropriate stimulation time for the analysis of the expression of human macrophage polarization markers in vitro. Providing such a reference guide will likely facilitate the investigation of macrophage polarization and its reproducibility."
https://openalex.org/W4220888452,"Engineered proteins generally must possess a stable structure in order to achieve their designed function. Stable designs, however, are astronomically rare within the space of all possible amino acid sequences. As a consequence, many designs must be tested computationally and experimentally in order to find stable ones, which is expensive in terms of time and resources. Here we use a high-throughput, low-fidelity assay to experimentally evaluate the stability of approximately 200,000 novel proteins. These include a wide range of sequence perturbations, providing a baseline for future work in the field. We build a neural network model that predicts protein stability given only sequences of amino acids, and compare its performance to the assayed values. We also report another network model that is able to generate the amino acid sequences of novel stable proteins given requested secondary sequences. Finally, we show that the predictive model—despite weaknesses including a noisy data set—can be used to substantially increase the stability of both expert-designed and model-generated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4220939129,"Expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase ephrin receptor A10 (EphA10), which is undetectable in most normal tissues except for the male testis, has been shown to correlate with tumor progression and poor prognosis in several malignancies, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Therefore, EphA10 could be a potential therapeutic target, likely with minimal adverse effects. However, no effective clinical drugs against EphA10 are currently available. Here, we report high expression levels of EphA10 in tumor regions of breast, lung, and ovarian cancers as well as in immunosuppressive myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, we developed anti-EphA10 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically recognize cell surface EphA10, but not other EphA family isoforms, and target tumor regions precisely in vivo with no apparent accumulation in other organs. In syngeneic TNBC mouse models, we found that anti-EphA10 mAb clone #4 enhanced tumor regression, therapeutic response rate, and T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Notably, the chimeric antigen receptor T cells derived from clone #4 significantly inhibited TNBC cell viability in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Together, our findings suggest that targeting EphA10 via EphA10 mAbs and EphA10-specific chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy may represent a promising strategy for patients with EphA10-positive tumors."
https://openalex.org/W4220953220,"Antibodies that target immune checkpoint proteins such as programmed cell death protein 1, programmed death ligand 1, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 in human cancers have achieved impressive clinical success; however, a significant proportion of patients fail to respond to these treatments. Galectin-9 (Gal-9), a β-galactoside-binding protein, has been shown to induce T-cell death and facilitate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment by binding to immunomodulatory receptors such as T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 3 and the innate immune receptor dectin-1, suggesting that it may have potential as a target for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we report the development of two novel Gal-9-neutralizing antibodies that specifically react with the N-carbohydrate-recognition domain of human Gal-9 with high affinity. We also show using cell-based functional assays that these antibodies efficiently protected human T cells from Gal-9-induced cell death. Notably, in a T-cell/tumor cell coculture assay of cytotoxicity, these antibodies significantly promoted T cell-mediated killing of tumor cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate potent inhibition of human Gal-9 by neutralizing antibodies, which may open new avenues for cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4221082111,"eIF3a (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3a), a subunit of the eIF3 complex, has been suggested to play a regulatory role in protein synthesis and in cellular response to DNA-damaging treatments. S6K1 is an effector and a mediator of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) in regulating protein synthesis and integrating diverse signals into control of cell growth and response to stress. Here, we show that eIF3a regulates S6K1 activity by inhibiting mTORC1 kinase via regulating Raptor synthesis. The regulation of Raptor synthesis is via eIF3a interaction with HuR (human antigen R) and binding of the eIF3a-HuR complex to the 5'-UTR of Raptor mRNA. Furthermore, mTORC1 may mediate eIF3a function in cellular response to cisplatin by regulating synthesis of NER proteins and NER activity. Taken together, we conclude that the mTOR signaling pathway may also be regulated by translational control and mediate eIF3a regulation of cancer cell response to cisplatin by regulating NER protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4220693400,"Background and aims Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is characterized by acute liver failure, neurocognitive impairment and renal failure. Severe inflammatory reactions are also known to occur in AH. Inflammation and bacterial translocation in the gut are thought to have major impact on disease development and progression. The mortality rate for AH is close to 50%. We aimed to assess the efficacy of rifaximin in treating AH and its impact on inflammation and metabolism. Methods The trial was approved by relevant authorities (EudraCT no: 2014-02264-33, Scientific Ethics Committee, jr. no: H-1-2014-056). Primary outcomes were changes in metabolic and inflammatory markers. Secondary outcomes were portal hypertension, kidney and neurocognitive function. Results Thirty-two patients were randomized to standard medical therapy (SMT) or SMT plus rifaximin, allocation was concealed. Four patients in the SMT group and five patients in the SMT + rifaximin group died due to AH and liver failure. No adverse events related to the study medication were observed. We found no significant differences in amino acids or inflammation markers (IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, interferon-γ) between the groups after 28 and 90 days. Conclusion Rifaximin does not alter inflammation or metabolism in patients with AH."
https://openalex.org/W4220695445,"Wireless continuous vital sign monitoring by wearable devices have recently become available for patients on general wards to promote timely detection of clinical deterioration. Many continuous monitoring systems use conventional threshold alarm settings to alert nurses in case of deviating vital signs. However, frequent false alarms often lead to alarm fatigue and inefficiencies in the workplace. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of continuous vital sign monitoring without the use of alarms, thereby exclusively relying on interval trend monitoring.This explanatory sequential mixed methods study was conducted at an abdominal surgical ward of a tertiary teaching hospital. Heart rate and respiratory rate of patients were measured every minute by a wearable sensor. Trends were visualized and assessed six times per day by nurses and once a day by doctors during morning rounds. Instead of using alarms we focused exclusively on regular vital sign trend analysis by nurses and doctors. Primary outcome was feasibility in terms of acceptability by professionals, assessed by the Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of Use questionnaire and further explored in two focus groups, as well as fidelity.A total of 56 patients were monitored and in 80.5% (n = 536) of nurses' work shifts the trends assessments were documented. All deviating trends (n = 17) were recognized in time. Professionals (N = 46) considered continuous monitoring satisfying (4.8±1.0 on a 1-7 Likert-scale) and were willing to use the technology. Although insight into vital sign trends allowed faster anticipation and action upon changed patient status, professionals were neutral about usefulness (4.4±1.0). They found continuous monitoring easy to use (4.7±0.8) and easy to learn (5.3±1.0) but indicated the need for gaining practical experience. Nurses considered the use of alarms for deviating vital signs unnecessary, when trends were regularly assessed and reported.We demonstrated that continuous vital signs trend monitoring without using alarms was feasible in the general ward setting, thereby avoiding unnecessary alarms and preventing alarm fatigue. When monitoring in a general ward setting, the standard use of alarms may therefore be reconsidered."

https://openalex.org/W4220978810,"The conformationally dynamic HIV-1 envelope trimer (Env) is the target of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that block viral entry. Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has revealed that HIV-1 Env exists in at least three conformational states on the virion. Prior to complete host-receptor engagement (State 3), Env resides most prevalently in the smFRET-defined State 1, which is preferentially recognized by most bnAbs that are elicited by natural infection. smFRET has also revealed that soluble trimers containing prefusion-stabilizing disulfide and isoleucine-to-proline substitutions reside primarily in State 2, which is a required intermediate between States 1 and 3. While high-resolution Env structures have been determined for States 2 and 3, the structure of these trimers in State 1 is unknown. To provide insight into the State 1 structure, here we characterized antigenic differences between smFRET-defined states and then correlated these differences with known structural differences between States 2 and 3. We found that cell surface-expressed Env was enriched in each state using state-enriching antibody fragments or small-molecule virus entry inhibitors and then assessed binding to HIV-1 bnAbs preferentially binding different states. We observed small but consistent differences in binding between Env enriched in States 1 and 2, and a more than 10-fold difference in binding to Env enriched in these states versus Env enriched in State 3. We conclude that structural differences between HIV-1 Env States 1 and 3 are likely more than 10-fold greater than those between States 1 and 2, providing important insight into State 1."
https://openalex.org/W4221116399,"Ground-glass opacity (GGO)-a hazy, gray appearing density on computed tomography (CT) of lungs-is one of the hallmark features of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients. This AI-driven study is focused on segmentation, morphology, and distribution patterns of GGOs.We use an AI-driven unsupervised machine learning approach called PointNet++ to detect and quantify GGOs in CT scans of COVID-19 patients and to assess the severity of the disease. We have conducted our study on the ""MosMedData"", which contains CT lung scans of 1110 patients with or without COVID-19 infections. We quantify the morphologies of GGOs using Minkowski tensors and compute the abnormality score of individual regions of segmented lung and GGOs.PointNet++ detects GGOs with the highest evaluation accuracy (98%), average class accuracy (95%), and intersection over union (92%) using only a fraction of 3D data. On average, the shapes of GGOs in the COVID-19 datasets deviate from sphericity by 15% and anisotropies in GGOs are dominated by dipole and hexapole components. These anisotropies may help to quantitatively delineate GGOs of COVID-19 from other lung diseases.The PointNet++ and the Minkowski tensor based morphological approach together with abnormality analysis will provide radiologists and clinicians with a valuable set of tools when interpreting CT lung scans of COVID-19 patients. Implementation would be particularly useful in countries severely devastated by COVID-19 such as India, where the number of cases has outstripped available resources creating delays or even breakdowns in patient care. This AI-driven approach synthesizes both the unique GGO distribution pattern and severity of the disease to allow for more efficient diagnosis, triaging and conservation of limited resources."
https://openalex.org/W4220939185,"Foot posture which forms the distal supporting structure influences on postural stability. Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) who are more likely to be overweight or obese may present with flat foot with symptoms that affect daily activities. The aim of this study was to compare the foot posture and body composition measures between children with and without DCD. In addition, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between foot posture and fat percentage.Fifty-nine children with DCD (mean age = 8.07±1.10) and sixty-two typically developing children (mean age = 7.97±1.05) were recruited to the DCD and control group respectively. All children received a foot posture assessment and a whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. Foot Posture Index 6 (FPI-6) total scores, sub-scores and lower limb body composition measures including fat mass, lean mass, total mass, fat percentage and fat mass index were measured.Children with DCD revealed a significantly higher FPI-6 left (1.12; 95% CI: 0.172, 2.061) and right (1.15; 95% CI: 0.218, 2.079) total score. FPI-6 sub-scores (talar head palpation and abduction/adduction forefoot on rearfoot) illustrated significant differences between children with and without DCD. Children with DCD had a significantly higher total fat mass (1247.48g; 95% CI: 121.654, 2373.304), total fat percentage (1.82%; 95% CI: 0.115, 3.525) and fat mass index (0.56kg/m2; 95% CI: 0.036, 1.069). There was a significant relationship between FPI-6 right total score and total fat percentage.The findings of this study showed that children with DCD exhibited significantly more pronated foot posture and higher body composition measures compared to typically developing children. Moreover, with FPI-6 right total score significantly related to the total fat percentage, it may require more than just detecting abnormal foot structures in children with DCD but also promoting a healthy lifestyle to prevent obesity."
https://openalex.org/W4221055955,"Critical Thermal maximum (CTmax) is often used to characterize the upper thermal limits of organisms and represents a key trait for evaluating the fitness of ectotherms. The lack of standardization in CTmax assays has, however, introduced methodological problems in its measurement, which can lead to questionable estimates of species' upper thermal limits. Focusing on ants, which are model organisms for research on thermal ecology, we aim to obtain a reliable ramping rate that will yield the most rigorous measures of CTmax for the most species. After identifying three commonly used ramping rates (i.e., 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0°C min-1) in the literature, we experimentally determine their effects on the CTmax values of 27 species measured using dynamic assays. Next, we use static assays to evaluate the accuracy of these values in function of the time of exposure. Finally, we use field observations of species' foraging activities across a wide range of ground temperatures to identify the most biologically relevant CTmax values and to develop a standardized method. Our results demonstrate that the use of a 1°C min-1 ramping rate in dynamic assays yields the most reliable CTmax values for comparing ant species' upper thermal limits, which are further validated in static assays and field observations. We further illustrate how methodological biases in physiological trait measurements can affect subsequent analyses and conclusions on community comparisons between strata and habitats, and the detection of phylogenetic signal (Pagel's λ and Bloomberg's K). Overall, our study presents a methodological framework for identifying a reliable and standardized ramping rate to measure CTmax in ants, which can be applied to other ectotherms. Particular attention should be given to CTmax values obtained with less suitable ramping rates, and the potential biases they may introduce to trait-based research on global warming and habitat conversion, as well as inferences about phylogenetic conservatism."
https://openalex.org/W4220682703,"Vaccines are highly effective in minimizing serious cases of COVID-19 and pivotal to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite widespread availability, vaccination rates fall short of levels required to bring about widespread immunity, with low rates attributed to vaccine hesitancy. It is therefore important to identify the beliefs and concerns associated with vaccine intentions and uptake. The present study aimed to develop and validate, using the AMEE Guide, the Vaccination Concerns in COVID-19 Scale (VaCCS), a comprehensive measure of beliefs and concerns with respect to COVID-19 vaccines. In the scale development phase, samples of Australian (N = 53) and USA (N = 48) residents completed an initial open-response survey to elicit beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccines. A concurrent rapid literature review was conducted to identify content from existing scales on vaccination beliefs. An initial pool of items was developed informed by the survey responses and rapid review. The readability and face validity of the item pool was assessed by behavioral science experts (N = 5) and non-experts (N = 10). In the scale validation phase, samples of Australian (N = 522) and USA (N = 499) residents completed scaled versions of the final item pool and measures of socio-political, health beliefs and outcomes, and trait measures. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a scale comprising 35 items with 8 subscales, and subsequent confirmatory factor analyses indicated acceptable fit of the scale structure with the data in each sample and factorial invariance across samples. Concurrent and predictive validity tests indicated a theoretically and conceptually predictable pattern of relations between the VaCCS subscales with the socio-political, health beliefs and outcomes, and trait measures, and key subscales predicted intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The VaCCS provides a novel measure to assess beliefs and concerns toward COVID-19 vaccination that researchers and practitioners can use in its entirety or select specific sub-scales to use according to their needs."
https://openalex.org/W4220736739,"Staphylococcus lugdunensis has increasingly been recognized as a pathogen that can cause serious infection indicating this bacterium overcomes host nutritional immunity. Despite this, there exists a significant knowledge gap regarding the iron acquisition mechanisms employed by S. lugdunensis, especially during infection of the mammalian host. Here we show that S. lugdunensis can usurp hydroxamate siderophores and staphyloferrin A and B from Staphylococcus aureus. These transport activities all required a functional FhuC ATPase. Moreover, we show that the acquisition of catechol siderophores and catecholamine stress hormones by S. lugdunensis required the presence of the sst-1 transporter-encoding locus, but not the sst-2 locus. Iron-dependent growth in acidic culture conditions necessitated the ferrous iron transport system encoded by feoAB. Heme iron was acquired via expression of the iron-regulated surface determinant (isd) locus. During systemic infection of mice, we demonstrated that while S. lugdunensis does not cause overt illness, it does colonize and proliferate to high numbers in the kidneys. By combining mutations in the various iron acquisition loci (isd, fhuC, sst-1, and feo), we demonstrate that only a strain deficient for all of these systems was attenuated in its ability to proliferate to high numbers in the murine kidney. We propose the concerted action of heme and non-heme iron acquisition systems also enable S. lugdunensis to cause human infection."
https://openalex.org/W4220746922,"Brachypodium distachyon is a useful model organism for studying interaction of cereals with phytopathogenic fungi. The present study tested the possibility of a compatible interaction of B. distachyon with the endophytic fungus Microdochium bolleyi originated from wheat roots. There was evaluated the effect of this endophytic fungus on the intensity of the attack by pathogen Fusarium culmorum in B. distachyon and wheat, and also changes in expression of genes (in B. distachyon: BdChitinase1, BdPR1-5, BdLOX3, BdPAL, BdEIN3, and BdAOS; and in wheat: TaB2H2(chitinase), TaPR1.1, TaLOX, TaPAL, TaEIN2, and TaAOS) involved in defence against pathogens. Using light microscopy and newly developed specific primers was found to be root colonization of B. distachyon by the endophyte M. bolleyi. B. distachyon plants, as well as wheat inoculated with M. bolleyi showed significantly weaker symptoms on leaves from infection by fungus F. culmorum than did plants without the endophyte. Expression of genes BdPR1-5, BdChitinase1, and BdLOX3 in B. distachyon and of TaPR1.1 and TaB2H2 in wheat was upregulated after infection with F. culmorum. M. bolleyi-mediated resistance in B. distachyon was independent of the expression of the most tested genes. Taken together, the results of the present study show that B. distachyon can be used as a model host system for endophytic fungus M. bolleyi."
https://openalex.org/W4220954738,"This study examines barriers to fish consumption during the complementary feeding period in two coastal counties of Kenya with high rates of child malnutrition. Study findings indicate that young child fish consumption is impacted by factors related to accessibility, food preferences, and caregiver's knowledge and beliefs about fish during the complementary feeding period. These factors are influenced by prominent community figures such as elder women and health workers, whose own beliefs and understandings are impacted by underlying cultural norms, potentially limiting fish consumption. To our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in the coastal region of Kenya to focus on understanding fish consumption attitudes and beliefs during the complementary feeding phase. Our findings represent a critical first step towards the creation of more effective policies and interventions to address the significant nutritional disparities that exist in the study population."
https://openalex.org/W4221052646,"Host-pathogen specificity can arise from certain selective environments mediated by both the host and pathogen. Therefore, understanding the degree to which host species identity is correlated with pathogen genotype can help reveal historical host-pathogen dynamics. One animal disease of particular concern is chytridiomycosis, typically caused by the global panzootic lineage of the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd), termed Bd-GPL. This pathogen lineage has caused devastating declines in amphibian communities around the world. However, the site of origin for the common ancestor of modern Bd-GPL and the fine-scale transmission dynamics of this lineage have remained a mystery. This is especially the case in North America where Bd-GPL is widespread, but disease outbreaks occur sporadically. Herein, we use Bd genetic data collected throughout the United States from amphibian skin swabs and cultured isolate samples to investigate Bd genetic patterns. We highlight two case studies in Pennsylvania and Nevada where Bd-GPL genotypes are strongly correlated with host species identity. Specifically, in some localities bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) are infected with Bd-GPL lineages that are distinct from those infecting other sympatric amphibian species. Overall, we reveal a previously unknown association of Bd genotype with host species and identify the eastern United States as a Bd diversity hotspot and potential site of origin for Bd-GPL."
https://openalex.org/W4221104382,"Autistic children grow to become autistic adults, and autism is increasingly diagnosed in adulthood and later life. This qualitative study aimed to understand experiences of autism throughout adulthood. A national cohort study of autistic adults and relatives of autistic adults (ASC-UK), enabled purposive recruitment of a diverse sample. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 autistic adults (aged 20-71 years), mostly diagnosed in adulthood, and 16 relatives (aged 31-81 years) of autistic adults diagnosed across both childhood and adulthood (including some with learning disability). Interview topics included health, relationships, education, employment, quality of life and everyday experiences. Thematic analysis of the accounts of the autistic adults identified six key themes relating to their experiences: (1) diagnosis as validating yet limiting; (2) supportive and non-supportive social agents; (3) the ""invisibility"" of the needs of autistic adults; (4) health in the context of autism; (5) staying 'outside' the circle; and (6) multiple lives with autism. Data from relatives about autistic adult experiences gave additional perspectives on these themes. Experiences reported in other studies-of 'difference' from others, challenges of social engagement, and learning to 'conform' to society's expectations-were evident and relevant to male and female autistic adults, across all age groups, and unrelated to stage of life when diagnosed. Some expressed disappointment with their lives, but others were proud of their achievements. Education and employment, whilst challenging for many, were also rewarding for some. Health care and social services were often experienced as inaccessible, inappropriate, or lacking understanding of the individual's needs. We conclude that greater public understanding of autism as experienced in adulthood is needed. Key priorities are improving the availability of 'appropriate' health and social care services for autistic adults and families, and providing practical support to enable enhanced participation in life."
https://openalex.org/W4221134966,"Understanding the cell molecular changes occurring as a results of climatic circumstances is crucial in the current days in which climate change and global warming are one of the most serious challenges that living organisms have to face. Sperm are one of the mammals’ cells most sensitive to heat, therefore evaluating the impact of seasonal changes in terms of its transcriptional activity can contribute to elucidate how these cells cope with heat stress events. We sequenced the total sperm RNA from 64 ejaculates, 28 collected in summer and 36 collected in autumn, from 40 Manchega rams. A highly rich transcriptome (11,896 different transcripts) with 90 protein coding genes that exceed an average number of 5000 counts were found. Comparing transcriptome in the summer and autumn ejaculates, 236 significant differential abundance genes were assessed, most of them (228) downregulated. The main functions that these genes are related to sexual reproduction and negative regulation of protein metabolic processes and kinase activity. Sperm response to heat stress supposes a drastic decrease of the transcriptional activity, and the upregulation of only a few genes related with the basic functions to maintain the organisms’ homeostasis and surviving. Rams’ spermatozoids carry remnant mRNAs which are retrospectively indicators of events occurring along the spermatogenesis process, including abiotic factors such as environmental temperature."
https://openalex.org/W4220720469,"Obesity in asthmatics has been associated with higher airway oxidative stress in which dysfunctional mitochondria are a potential contributing source of excess free radicals. Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) plays an important role in reducing mitochondrial-derived oxidative stress and could, therefore, have therapeutic potential in these patients.We used primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) from asthmatics and healthy controls to evaluate: a) protein levels of Paraoxonase 2 and b) to test the potential protective effect of quercetin supplementation in cells under oxidative stress conditions.Compared to lean controls, obese asthmatics had significantly lower PON2 airway epithelial levels (respectively, 1.08 vs. 0.47 relative units normalized by GAPDH) (p-value < 0.006). Treating HBECs in vitro for 24 hrs. with 25μM quercetin significantly increased PON2 protein levels: 15.5 treated cells vs. 9.8 untreated cells (relative units normalized by GAPDH) (p value = 0.004). Notably, compared to untreated cells, quercetin supplementation reduces mitochondrial superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production on HBECs cells exposed to different oxidative stress triggers such as 1-2 Naphthoquinone (1-2 NQ) and hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that PON2 might play a protective role ameliorating oxidative injury on human airway epithelium.Compared to lean controls, obese asthmatics have significantly reduced PON2 levels in airway epithelial cells. Treatment with quercetin in vitro increased PON2 protein levels and prevented oxidative stress from different types of stimuli. Hence, quercetin supplementation may be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent obesity-mediated airway oxidative stress in obese asthmatics."
https://openalex.org/W4220724650,"The stateless population in Thailand live by accessing all public services, including the health care system. Stigma is a crucial factor impacting these individuals' lives and their access to medical care. This study aimed to understand the experience of the stateless population in Thailand and how they overcome the problem of stigma.A qualitative method was used to elicit information from key informants who were members of the stateless population, which was classified as those who did not hold Thai identification cards (IDs). A questionnaire was used to guide the interview, which was conducted in a private and confidential room. The interviews were conducted after voluntary agreement was obtained from the participants; each interview was held in August 2021 and lasted for approximately 45 minutes.Fifty-one people participated in the study; 68.6% were females, 86.3% were married, and 90.2% were Akha or Lahu. The stateless population in Thailand reported four types of perceived stigma: having a lower ability to request that their needs be met, not being equal to others, not being able to qualify for health care services and being ranked below other hill tribe people who have IDs. The phrase ""life is nothing"" was presented by the participants, who reported that they felt like an invisible population in Thailand. Some participants reported that other hill tribe people who have IDs act as stigma perpetuators among members of the stateless population who do not have IDs. Maintaining their privacy within their village, trying to obtain a Thai ID, and practicing the Thai language were the main ways of avoiding the stigma reported by the stateless population. Obtaining a Thai ID was detected as the top goal in their aim to overcome the stigma problem.The stateless population in Thailand live as an invisible population and are negatively treated via various patterns from others. Accessing Thai IDs and education are argued to be the most effective procedures for addressing the problem under the implementation schemes of the relevant organizations."
https://openalex.org/W4220929519,"After spinal cord injury, gliomesenchymal scaring inhibits axonal regeneration as a physical barrier. In peripheral nerve injuries, native spider silk was shown to be an effective scaffold to facilitate axonal re-growth and nerve regeneration. This study tested a two-composite scaffold made of longitudinally oriented native spider silk containing a Haemocomplettan fibrin sheath to bridge lesions in the spinal cord and enhance axonal sprouting. In vitro cultivation of neuronal cells on spider silk and fibrin revealed no cytotoxicity of the scaffold components. When spinal cord tissue was cultured on spider silk that was reeled around a metal frame, migration of different cell types, including neurons and neural stem cells, was observed. The scaffold was implanted into spinal cord lesions of four Wistar rats to evaluate the physical stress caused on the animals and examine the bridging potential for axonal sprouting and spinal cord regeneration. However, the implantation in-vivo resulted in a granulomatous foreign body reaction. Spider silk might be responsible for the strong immune response. Thus, the immune response to native spider silk seems to be stronger in the central nervous system than it is known to be in the peripheral body complicating the application of native spider silk in spinal cord injury treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4220982566,"Purpose The aim of this study was to explore the effects of chronic low-dose-rate gamma-radiation at a multi-scale level. The specific objective was to obtain an overall view of the endothelial cell response, by integrating previously published data on different cellular endpoints and highlighting possible different mechanisms underpinning radiation-induced senescence. Materials and methods Different datasets were collected regarding experiments on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) which were chronically exposed to low dose rates (0, 1.4, 2.1 and 4.1 mGy/h) of gamma-rays until cell replication was arrested. Such exposed cells were analyzed for different complementary endpoints at distinct time points (up to several weeks), investigating cellular functions such as proliferation, senescence and angiogenic properties, as well as using transcriptomics and proteomics profiling. A mathematical model was proposed to describe proliferation and senescence. Results Simultaneous ceasing of cell proliferation and senescence onset as a function of time were well reproduced by the logistic growth curve, conveying shared equilibria between the two endpoints. The combination of all the different endpoints investigated highlighted a dose-dependence for prematurely induced senescence. However, the underpinning molecular mechanisms appeared to be dissimilar for the different dose rates, thus suggesting a more complex scenario. Conclusions This study was conducted integrating different datasets, focusing on their temporal dynamics, and using a systems biology approach. Results of our analysis highlight that different dose rates have different effects in inducing premature senescence, and that the total cumulative absorbed dose also plays an important role in accelerating endothelial cell senescence."

https://openalex.org/W4220682096,"Quantifying feeding behaviour of generalist predators at the population and individual levels is crucial for understanding the structure and functioning of food webs. Individual predator/consumer feeding niches can be significantly narrower than that of the population across animal taxa. In such species, the population of a generalist predator becomes essentially an ensemble of specialist individuals and this often highly affects the dynamics of the prey-predator interactions. Currently, few experimental systems exist that are both easily technically manipulated in a lab and are reliable to accurately assess effects of individual specialisation within generalist predators. Here we argue that a freshwater predaceous snail, Anentome helena (also known as an ‘assassin snail’), is a convenient and reliable experimental system to study feeding of a generalist predator on multiple food types which exhibits well-pronounced specialisation of foraging individuals. Using A. helena we experimentally test: (i) how relative prey abundances in the environment affect the feeding patterns, (ii) whether the feeding patterns are consistent over the duration of the experimental period, and (iii) compare the feeding niche breadth of individuals to that of the laboratory population. By offering four different prey snail species, at a range of relative abundances, we show that there are consistent patterns in feeding. Importantly, the consumption of each prey was independent of the relative abundance at which they were present. Individual predators showed selectivity to a particular prey, i.e. the population of assassin snails seems to be formed of individuals that specialise on different prey. Our findings would contribute to the recent revision and the ongoing debate on the classification of predator species into generalists and specialists."
https://openalex.org/W4220748332,"In this paper, we present a network-based clustering method, called vector Wasserstein clustering (vWCluster), based on the vector-valued Wasserstein distance derived from optimal mass transport (OMT) theory. This approach allows for the natural integration of multi-layer representations of data in a given network from which one derives clusters via a hierarchical clustering approach. In this study, we applied the methodology to multi-omics data from the two largest breast cancer studies. The resultant clusters showed significantly different survival rates in Kaplan-Meier analysis in both datasets. CIBERSORT scores were compared among the identified clusters. Out of the 22 CIBERSORT immune cell types, 9 were commonly significantly different in both datasets, suggesting the difference of tumor immune microenvironment in the clusters. vWCluster can aggregate multi-omics data represented as a vectorial form in a network with multiple layers, taking into account the concordant effect of heterogeneous data, and further identify subgroups of tumors in terms of mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4220835572,"In an era of mass extinction and biodiversity crisis, it is increasingly crucial to cultivate more just and inclusive multispecies futures. As mitigation and adaption efforts are formed in response to these crises, just transitions forward require intentional consideration of the hybrid entanglement of humans, human societies, and wider landscapes. We thus apply a critical hybridity framework to examine the entanglement of the pollinator crisis with the cultural and agricultural practice of hobbyist beekeeping. We draw on ethnographic engagements with Massachusetts beekeepers and find apiculture to be widely understood as a form of environmentalism—including as both a mitigation to and adaptation for the pollinator crisis. Illustrating how power-laden socioecological negotiations shape and reshape regional environments, we then discuss how this narrative relies on the capitalistic and instrumental logics characteristic of Capitalocene environmentalisms. These rationalities, which obscure the hybridity of landscapes, consequently increase the likelihood of problematic unintended consequences. Also present, however, is a deeper engagement with hybrid perspectives, with some beekeepers even offering pathways toward inclusive solutions. We conclude that if more just and biodiverse futures are to be realized, beekeeping communities must foster increasingly hybrid visions of apiculture as situated within socioecological and contested landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W4220850989,"The objective of this paper is to identify the relationship between farm income and assets within the European Union (EU) in the context of economic and environmental sustainable development. The scientific context is connected to economic theory (the recognition of the nature of such a relationship, as well as the determination of whether sustainable development acts as a stimulant or destimulant under these conditions). The Farm Accounting Data Network system was employed in the article. The econometric models were estimated by panel data based on the reported results of the farms operations in EU member states for the period of 2004-2018. Accordingly, the relationship between income and assets is positive and statistically significant, but not very clear in the group of surveyed farms. Moreover, economic sustainability was found to positively influences the relationship between income and assets. In contrast, the relationship between incomes and assets was weakened. The situation is brought about by the intrinsic growth in the value of the land, as well as by the growing importance of non-productive assets. Thus, farmers in EU countries are becoming wealthier in terms of the value of their assets but, this is not reflected directly in their income. The reason is the growing importance of environmental and social functions in the agriculture the European Union. Greater skills in asset management at farm level are, therefore, required to mitigate the situation."
https://openalex.org/W4220905120,"α-glucosidase inhibitors represent an important class of type 2 antidiabetic drugs and they act by lowering postprandial hyperglycemia. Today, only three synthetic inhibitors exist on the market, and there is a need for novel, natural and more efficient molecules exhibiting this activity. In this study, we investigated the ability of Tamarix nilotica ethanolic and aqueous shoot extracts, as well as methanolic fractions prepared from aqueous crude extracts to inhibit α-glucosidase. Both, 50% ethanol and aqueous extracts inhibited α-glucosidase in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC 50 values of 12.5 μg/mL and 24.8 μg/mL, respectively. Importantly, α-glucosidase inhibitory activity observed in the T . nilotica crude extracts was considerably higher than pure acarbose (IC 50 = 151.1 μg/mL), the most highly prescribed α-glucosidase inhibitor on the market. When T . nilotica crude extracts were fractionated using methanol, enhanced α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was observed in general, with the highest observed α-glucosidase inhibitory activity in the 30% methanol fraction (IC 50 = 5.21 μg/mL). Kinetic studies further revealed a competitive reversible mechanism of inhibition by the plant extract. The phytochemical profiles of 50% ethanol extracts, aqueous extracts, and the methanolic fractions were investigated and compared using a metabolomics approach. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in the contents of the crude extracts and fractions and potentially identified the molecules that were most responsible for these observed variations. Higher α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was associated with an enrichment of terpenoids, fatty acids, and flavonoids. Among the identified molecules, active compounds with known α-glucosidase inhibitory activity were detected, including unsaturated fatty acids, triterpenoids, and flavonoid glycosides. These results put forward T . nilotica as a therapeutic plant for type 2 diabetes and a source of α-glucosidase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W4221112847,"Cyclotides have a wide range of bioactivities relevant for agricultural and pharmaceutical applications. This large family of naturally occurring macrocyclic peptides is divided into three subfamilies, with the bracelet subfamily being the largest and comprising the most potent cyclotides reported to date. However, attempts to harness the natural bioactivities of bracelet cyclotides and engineer-optimized analogs have been hindered by a lack of understanding of the structural and functional role of their constituent residues, which has been challenging because bracelet cyclotides are difficult to produce synthetically. We recently established a facile strategy to make the I11L mutant of cyclotide hyen D that is as active as the parent peptide, enabling the subsequent production of a series of variants. In the current study, we report an alanine mutagenesis structure-activity study of [I11L] hyen D to probe the role of individual residues on peptide folding using analytical chromatography, on molecular function using surface plasmon resonance, and on therapeutic potential using cytotoxicity assays. We found that Glu-6 and Thr-15 are critical for maintaining the structure of bracelet cyclotides and that hydrophobic residues in loops 2 and 3 are essential for membrane binding and cytotoxic activity, findings that are distinct from the structural and functional characteristics determined for other cyclotide subfamilies. In conclusion, this is the first report of a mutagenesis scan conducted on a bracelet cyclotide, offering insights into their function and supporting future efforts to engineer bracelet cyclotides for biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W4221136538,"Background Reported cases of COVID-19 may be underestimated due to mild or asymptomatic cases and a low testing rate in the general population. Research question What is the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population and how it compares with the data on SARS-CoV-2 cases reported by a national health surveillance system (SNVS 2.0). Study design and methods This was a population-based, seroepidemiological, cross-sectional study in the city of Puerto Madryn, a middle size city in the Province of Chubut, Argentina. The study period was between March 3 and April 17, 2021. The sample size was calculated using the technique of calculation of confidence intervals for a proportion. Participants were selected using stratified and cluster probability sampling. A total of 1405 subjects were invited to participate in the study. Participants were divided into the following four age groups: 1) 0 to 14, 2) 15 to 39, 3) 40 to 64, and 4) 65 or older. After informed consent was obtained, a blood sample was taken by puncture of the fingertip, and a structured questionnaire was administered to evaluate demographics, socioeconomic status, level of education, comorbidities and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. COVID-19 seroprevalence was documented using an immunoenzymatic test for the in vitro detection of IgG antibodies specific to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Results A total of 987 participants completed the survey. Seropositivity in the full study population was 39,2% and in those under 15 years of age, 47.1%. Cases reported by the SNSV 2.0 amounted to 9.35% of the total population and 1.4% of those under 15 years of age. Interpretation The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the general population is four times higher than the number of cases reported by the SNVS 2.0 in the city of Puerto Madryn. For each child under the age of 15 identified by the SNVS 2.0 with COVID-19, there are more than 30 unrecognized infections. Seroepidemiological studies are important to define the real extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a particular community. Children may play a significant role in the progression of the current pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4220740455,"To estimate the magnitude of maternity waiting home utilization and identify its associated factors in Sidama Zone, Southern Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 748 mothers who gave birth within the last year in the selected woredas (districts) of Sidama Zone. Data were collected from April 1-30, 2019 by using pre-tested and structured questionnaires. Data were coded and entered into EpiData version 3.5.1 and exported to Stata Version 13 software for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with maternity waiting home utilization adjusting for confounders.The mean (SD) of the age of the mothers was 31.26(6.42). Utilization of maternity waiting home in Sidama Zone was 67.25% (95% CI: 63.79-70.53).Maternity waiting home utilization was positively associated with protestant religion (AOR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.00-2.82) and having a spouse who can read and write (AOR = 2.0; 95%CI: 1.11-3.66) while it was negatively associated with maternal age of 31-40 (AOR = 0.4; 95%CI: 0.28-0.64) relative to the age group of 20-30, daily laborer occupation of mothers (AOR = 0.2; 95%CI: 0.06-0.76), monthly income under the poverty level (825-1320EBR) (AOR = 0.6; 95%CI: 0.36-0.92) relative with extreme poverty line (<825 EBR), lack of knowledge about maternity waiting home (AOR = 0.009; 95%CI: 0.002-0.03).Women who had knowledge about maternity waiting home, had a husband who can read and write and protestant religion followers have higher probabilities of maternity waiting home utilization, whereas women (31-40 years old), daily laborers and whose family income is below the poverty level have lower probabilities of maternity waiting home utilization. Therefore, Health education about maternity waiting home utilization, spouse education, and women's economic empowerment is crucial to enhance maternity waiting home utilization."
https://openalex.org/W4220819460,"Fluoride contamination is a major problem in wastewater treatment. Metaettringite (which has previously shown enhanced anion adsorption) was investigated as a possible adsorbent to remove fluoride from low-concentration solution (25 mg-F/L). The fluoride removal properties of ettringite and metaettringite were first compared at pH 10, and metaettringite was found to be more effective. The dominant reaction mechanism for fluoride adsorption in metaettringite was found to be recrystallization of metaettringite by rehydration; this was accompanied by precipitation of calcium fluoride. The adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second order model. Metaettringite was also able to remove fluoride effectively in low pH environment (i.e., at pH 3.5). The influence of coexistence of sulfate ions in solution on the fluoride removal performance was investigated, and a small decrease in performance was noted. The residual fluoride concentrations obtained with higher doses of metaettringite were lower than those specified by the Japanese effluent standard (non-coastal areas: 8 mg-F/L; coastal areas: 15 mg-F/L). The fluoride removal capacity of metaettringite was compared with those of other solid materials. The observed maximum capacity was 174.7 mg-F/g-metaettringite. In the case of high fluoride concentration solution, the main removal mechanism will be changed to calcium fluoride precipitation. In general, metaettringite is regarded as promising material for fluoride removal in wastewater treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4220890993,"The Government of Indonesia is determined to follow global commitments to reduce the neonatal mortality rate. Yet, there is a paucity of information on contributing factors and causes of neonatal deaths, particularly at the sub-national level. This study describes care-seeking during neonates' fatal illnesses and their causes of death.We conducted a cross-sectional community-based study to identify all neonatal deaths in Serang and Jember Districts, Indonesia. Follow-up interviews were conducted with the families of deceased neonates using an adapted verbal and social autopsy instrument. Cause of death was determined using the InSilicoVA algorithm.The main causes of death of 259 neonates were prematurity (44%) and intrapartum-related events (IPRE)-mainly birth asphyxia (39%). About 83% and 74% of the 259 neonates were born and died at a health facility, respectively; 79% died within the first week after birth. Of 70 neonates whose fatal illness began at home, 59 (84%) sought care during the fatal illness. Forty-eight of those 59 neonates went to a formal care provider; 36 of those 48 neonates (75%) were moderately or severely ill when the family decided to seek care. One hundred fifteen of 189 neonates (61%) whose fatal illnesses began at health facilities were born at a hospital. Among those 115, only 24 (21%) left the hospital alive-of whom 16 (67%) were referred by the hospital.The high proportion of deaths due to prematurity and IPRE suggests the need for improved management of small and asphyxiated newborns. The moderate to severe condition of neonates at the time when care was sought from home highlights the importance of early illness recognition and appropriate management for sick neonates. Among deceased neonates whose fatal illness began at their delivery hospital, the high proportion of referrals may indicate issues with hospital capability, capacity, and/or cost."
https://openalex.org/W4220931952,"Madagascar's radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiata) are critically endangered, threatened by illegal collection, and confiscated in alarming numbers in recent years. Robust population- and technique-specific hematology and biochemistry reference intervals are valuable yet heretofore missing tools for triage, rehabilitation, and reintroduction of confiscated radiated tortoises. We determined reference intervals in 120 previously confiscated, clinically healthy subadult radiated tortoises living under human care within their native habitat at the Tortoise Conservation Center (TCC). Specific analytes measured were manual packed cell volume, total solids, white blood cell (WBC) count and differentials, and biochemistry analytes using a point of care system. To evaluate the effects of different commonly used techniques on these analytes, we compared results between two venipuncture sites (subcarapacial sinus and brachial vein) and three different WBC quantification methods (Natt and Herrick, Leukopet, and slide estimate). Reference intervals were narrower for most analytes, and sodium and potassium were qualitatively higher in the TCC population compared to previously published values from radiated tortoises housed in North American institutions. Creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, glucose and inorganic phosphorus were all significantly greater in brachial samples than in subcarapacial samples. There was poor agreement and evidence of constant and/or proportional bias between all WBC quantification methods. Differences based on time of sample collection were incidentally found in some analytes. These results highlight the need for considering technique, demographic, and environmental factors in creating and applying reference intervals, and contribute foundational knowledge for improving care of radiated tortoises throughout the confiscation-to-release pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4220965466,"Because of the strong correlation between the blood concentration of circulating resistin and the illness severity of septic patients, resistin has been proposed as a mediator of sepsis pathophysiology. In vitro data indicate that human resistin directly impairs neutrophil migration and intracellular bacterial killing, although the significance of these findings in vivo remain unclear.The objectives of the present study were: (1) to validate the expression of human resistin in a clinically relevant, murine model of surgical sepsis, (2) to assess how sepsis-induced changes in resistin correlate with markers of infection and organ dysfunction, and (3) to investigate whether the expression of human resistin alters immune function or disease outcomes in vivo.107 male, C57BL/6 mice transgenic for the human resistin gene and its promoter elements (Retn+/-/-, or Retn+) were generated on a Retn-/- (mouse resistin knockout, or Rko) background. Outcomes were compared between age-matched transgenic and knockout mice. Acute sepsis was defined as the initial 24 h following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Physiologic and laboratory parameters correlating to the human Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score were measured in mice, and innate immune cell number/function in the blood and peritoneal cavity were assessed.CLP significantly increased circulating levels of human resistin. The severity of sepsis-induced leukopenia was comparable between Retn+ and Rko mice. Resistin was associated with increased production of neutrophil reactive oxygen species, a decrease in circulating neutrophils at 6 h and an increase in peritoneal Ly6Chi monocytes at 6 h and 24 h post-sepsis. However, intraperitoneal bacterial growth, organ dysfunction and mouse survival did not differ with resistin production in septic mice.Ex vivo resistin-induced impairment of neutrophil function do not appear to translate to increased sepsis severity or poorer outcomes in vivo following CLP."
https://openalex.org/W4221040741,"The objective of this research was to examine residents' awareness, attitudes, and compliance with COVID-19 public health guidelines in Vermont, which emerged as an early leader in national pandemic response. Our methods included conducting an online survey of adult Vermont residents between January and April 2021. We analyzed demographics associated with awareness and compliance, and identified features associated with non-compliance. Our results show that of the 2,208 adult Vermont residents who completed the survey, 90% were extremely aware of the state's COVID-19 guidelines, and 95% reported knowing exactly what to do to follow recommended actions. Political affiliation emerged as a primary factor related to attitudes and compliance. Self-identified Republicans were less likely to agree that public health measures keep people safe or help businesses stay open, and were less likely to follow masking, quarantine, social distancing, and vaccine guidance than Independents, Progressives, and Democrats. The large differences in COVID-19 infection and death rates across the country, and recent shift toward a ""pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" underscore the need for identifying public health strategies that work in some areas in order to adapt and apply them to areas that have struggled with controlling the virus. Consistent with national surveys, our results show that resistance to public health guidance is a partisan challenge even in states with high compliance. Identifying populations that are less supportive or hesitant to follow guidelines while understanding factors that motivate compliance can help inform strategies for developing targeted programs to encourage collective action on pandemic response. Developing communication strategies that reach people who do not believe COVID-19 guidelines keep them safe is necessary to reach universal compliance."

In the present study, we aimed to assess whether the thyroid hormone index and albumin are useful clinical parameters in short and long-term mortality.In the retrospective cohort study with a 5 year follow up, the data of 1292 patients who were hospitalized between January 1st-June 30th of 2014 were examined. Three months mortality as short term and 5-year mortality as long term were evaluated.Three months and 5 years mortality rates for 1064 patients were analyzed. We showed that hypoalbuminemia and thyroid hormone index had statistically significant effects on short and long-term mortality. According to ROC analysis it was demonstrated that the scoring system including biochemical parameters such as thyroid hormone index and serum albumin level was more significant for 3-month mortality. In addition, both scoring systems are equal in demonstrating long-term mortality.Thyroid hormone index and albumin could improve the prognostic performance of the original Charlson Comorbidity Index in short term mortality. The combined score may offer improvements in comorbidity summarization over existing scores."

Zooplankton have been monitored throughout the upper San Francisco Estuary from 1972 -present due to its status as a central hub of California water delivery and home to commercially important and endangered fishes. We integrated data from five monitoring programs, including over 300 locations, three size-classes of zooplankton targeted with different gears, over 80,000 samples, and over two billion sampled organisms. Over the duration of this dataset, species invasions have driven community turnover, periodic droughts have occurred, and important fishes have declined, likely due in part to reduced food supply from zooplankton. Data from the individual surveys have been used in prior studies on issues related to species invasions, flows, fish diets and population dynamics, zooplankton population dynamics, and community ecology.

We modeled Ebola virus transmission under the effect of behavior changes acting as a local inhibitor. A spatial model is used to simulate Ebola epidemics. Our findings suggest that behavior changes can explain why local Ebola outbreaks recede before substantial international aid was mobilized during the 2014-2016 epidemic."

Here, we determine how women in Malawi prepare for pregnancy and factors associated with pregnancy preparation.We used data from a previous cohort study comprising 4,244 pregnant mothers, recruited between March and December 2013 in Mchinji district, Malawi. Associations of pregnancy preparation with socio-demographic and obstetric factors were tested for using mixed effects ordinal regression, with the likelihood ratio and Wald's tests used for variable selection and independently testing the associations.Most mothers (63.9%) did not take any action to prepare for their pregnancies. For those who did (36.1%), eating more healthily (71.9%) and saving money (42.8%) were the most common forms of preparation. Mothers who were married (adjusted odds-ratio (AOR 7.77 (95% CI [5.31, 11.25]) or with no or fewer living children were more likely to prepare for pregnancy (AOR 4.71, 95% CI [2.89,7.61]. Mothers with a period of two to three years (AOR 2.51, 95% CI [1.47, 4.22]) or at least three years (AOR 3.67, 95%CI [2.18, 6.23]) between pregnancies were more likely to prepare for pregnancy than women with first pregnancy or shorter intervals. On the other hand, teenage and older (≥ 35 years old) mothers were less likely to prepare for pregnancy (AOR 0.61, 95%CI [0.47, 0.80]) and AOR 0.49 95%CI [0.33, 0.73], respectively).While preconception care may not be formally available in Malawi, our study has revealed that over a third of mothers took some action to prepare for pregnancy before conception. Although this leaves around two thirds of women who did not make any form of pregnancy preparation, our findings form a basis for future research and development of a preconception care package that suits the Malawian context."

Many operations need to be performed before use, among which drying of Astragali Radix (AR) pieces is a key step. Unfortunately, research on its drying mechanism is still limited. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques were applied to study the moisture state and distribution during drying. The content of bioactive components and texture changes were measured by HPLC and texture analyzer, respectively. The moisture content of the AR pieces decreased significantly during drying, and the time to reach the drying equilibrium were different at different temperatures. The time when at 70°C, 80°C, and 90°C reach complete drying are 180 min, 150 min and 120 min, respectively. 80°C was determined as the optimum drying temperature, and it was observed that the four flavonoids and astragaloside IV have some thermal stability in AR pieces. When dried at 80°C, although the total water content decreased, the free water content decreased from 99.38% to 15.49%, in contrast to the increase in bound water content from 0.62% to 84.51%. The texture parameters such as hardness changed to some extent, with the hardness rising most significantly from 686.23 g to 2656.67 g. Correlation analysis revealed some connection between moisture content and LF-NMR and texture analyzer parameters, but the springiness did not show a clear correlation with most parameters. This study shows that HPLC, LF-NMR, MRI, and texture analyzers provide a scientific basis for elucidating the drying principles of AR pieces. The method is useful and shows potential for extension and application; therefore, it can be easily extended to other natural herb medicines."
https://openalex.org/W4220952276,"Power laws are of interest to several scientific disciplines because they can provide important information about the underlying dynamics (e.g. scale invariance and self-similarity) of a given system. Because power laws are of increasing interest to the cardiac sciences as potential indicators of cardiac dysfunction, it is essential that rigorous, standardized analytical methods are employed in the evaluation of power laws. This study compares the methods currently used in the fields of condensed matter physics, geoscience, neuroscience, and cardiology in order to provide a robust analytical framework for evaluating power laws in stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte cultures. One potential power law-obeying phenomenon observed in these cultures is pacemaker translocations, or the spatial and temporal instability of the pacemaker region, in a 2D cell culture. Power law analysis of translocation data was performed using increasingly rigorous methods in order to illustrate how differences in analytical robustness can result in misleading power law interpretations. Non-robust methods concluded that pacemaker translocations adhere to a power law while robust methods convincingly demonstrated that they obey a doubly truncated power law. The results of this study highlight the importance of employing comprehensive methods during power law analysis of cardiomyocyte cultures."

However, a full understanding of how this cooperation occurs has yet to be sufficiently developed. The MT plus-end tracking protein CLIP-170 has been implicated in this actin–MT coordination by associating with the actin-binding signaling protein IQGAP1 and by promoting actin polymerization through binding with formins. Thus far, the interactions of CLIP-170 with actin were assumed to be indirect. Here, we demonstrate using high-speed cosedimentation assays that CLIP-170 can bind to filamentous actin (F-actin) directly. We found that the affinity of this binding is relatively weak but strong enough to be significant in the actin-rich cortex, where actin concentrations can be extremely high. Using CLIP-170 fragments and mutants, we show that the direct CLIP-170–F-actin interaction is independent of the FEED domain, the region that mediates formin-dependent actin polymerization, and that the CLIP-170 F-actin-binding region overlaps with the MT-binding region. Consistent with these observations, in vitro competition assays indicate that CLIP-170–F-actin and CLIP-170–MT interactions are mutually exclusive.

For example, actin accumulates at the cell cortex to maintain cell shape and promote whole-cell locomotion (1Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Actin, a central player in cell shape and movement.Science. 2009; 326: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar); microtubules (MTs) radiate from the center of typical animal cells to direct the position of cell organelles and promote intracellular transport (2Barlan K.

In addition to these seemingly individual activities, components of the cytoskeleton cooperate with each other to perform more complex cellular functions. The coordination and integration of the actin and MT cytoskeletons are known collectively as actin–MT crosstalk and are important for cellular processes, such as cell division, establishment of cell polarity, neuronal regeneration, wound healing, and muscle cell development (reviewed in Refs. (3Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Conserved microtubule-actin interactions in cell movement and morphogenesis.Nat.

Cytoskeletal crosstalk in cell migration.Trends Cell Biol. 2020; 30: 720-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). However, while the significance of this crosstalk is clear, the mechanisms by which it occurs have yet to be fully elucidated.Many mechanisms of actin–MT crosstalk have been studied, and they can be roughly categorized into three groups. First, shared signaling cascades can regulate the dynamics of both the actin and MT cytoskeletons (3Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Conserved microtubule-actin interactions in cell movement and morphogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 4Dogterom M. Koenderink G.H.

Cytoskeletal crosstalk in cell migration.Trends Cell Biol. 2020; 30: 720-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For example, Rho GTPases promote formin-dependent actin polymerization while also increasing stabilized MTs near the leading edge of the cell (6Wojnacki J. Quassollo G. Marzolo M.P. Caceres A. Rho GTPases at the crossroad of signaling networks in mammals: Impact of Rho-GTPases on microtubule organization and dynamics.Small GTPases. 2014; 5e28430Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Second, crosslinking proteins can bridge the two cytoskeletons (3Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Conserved microtubule-actin interactions in cell movement and morphogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 4Dogterom M. Koenderink G.H.

Cytoskeletal crosstalk in cell migration.Trends Cell Biol. 2020; 30: 720-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This connection of the two filamentous systems can go through one or multiple proteins. For example, spectraplakins physically interact with both actin and MTs simultaneously (7Jefferson J.J. Leung C.L. Liem R.K. Plakins: Goliaths that link cell junctions and the cytoskeleton.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas the MT-binding protein end-binding protein (EB)-3 connects the two cytoskeletal systems by binding actin through the actin-associated protein drebrin (8Geraldo S. Khanzada U.K. Parsons M. Chilton J.K. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Targeting of the F-actin-binding protein drebrin by the microtubule plus-tip protein EB3 is required for neuritogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Third, regulators of one filament type can bind or even be regulated by components of the other filament network (3Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Conserved microtubule-actin interactions in cell movement and morphogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 4Dogterom M.

Cytoskeletal crosstalk in cell migration.Trends Cell Biol. 2020; 30: 720-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Examples include the observation that the actin nucleator formin binds and stabilizes MTs in vivo (9Bartolini F. Moseley J.B. Schmoranzer J. Cassimeris L. Goode B.L. Gundersen G.G. The formin mDia2 stabilizes microtubules independently of its actin nucleation activity.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and that MT plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) regulate actin polymerization as described below.+TIPs are a subset of MT-associated proteins that track and regulate the dynamics of MT plus ends. Accumulating evidence implicates +TIPs as mediators of actin–MT crosstalk (reviewed in Refs. (3Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M.

Cytoskeletal crosstalk in cell migration.Trends Cell Biol. 2020; 30: 720-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). For example, the key +TIPs EB1 and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) interact with formins, and this interaction is believed to regulate actin–MT coordination (9Bartolini F. Moseley J.B. Schmoranzer J. Cassimeris L. Goode B.L. Gundersen G.G. The formin mDia2 stabilizes microtubules independently of its actin nucleation activity.J.

EB1 and APC bind to mDia to stabilize microtubules downstream of Rho and promote cell migration.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In addition, APC directly binds to actin both in vitro and in vivo (11Moseley J.B. Bartolini F. Okada K. Wen Y. Gundersen G.G. Goode B.L. Regulated binding of adenomatous polyposis coli protein to actin.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal domain of APC promotes actin assembly (12Juanes M.A. Bouguenina H. Eskin J.A. Jaiswal R. Badache A. Goode B.L. Adenomatous polyposis coli nucleates actin assembly to drive cell migration and microtubule-induced focal adhesion turnover.J.

Although the role of CLIP-170 in MT dynamics has been extensively studied, the role(s) of CLIP-170 in regulating actin are still under investigation. Previous studies have shown that CLIP-170 regulates the actin cytoskeleton by two different mechanisms: (1) Rac1/Cdc42/IQGAP1 forms a complex with CLIP-170 to connect the MT and actin networks for mediating cell polarization and migration (2Barlan K. Gelfand V.I. Microtubule-based transport and the distribution, tethering, and organization of organelles.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 4555-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and (2) CLIP-170 promotes actin polymerization through formins (22Lewkowicz E. Herit F. Le Clainche C. Bourdoncle P. Perez F. Niedergang F. The microtubule-binding protein CLIP-170 coordinates mDia1 and actin reorganization during CR3-mediated phagocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Henty-Ridilla J.L. Rankova A. Eskin J.A. Kenny K. Goode B.L. Accelerated actin filament polymerization from microtubule plus ends.Science. 2016; 352: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These two mechanisms are relatively well studied, but in both cases, the interactions between CLIP-170 and actin are indirect. We were interested in the possibility that CLIP-170 might bind to actin directly.Here, we used a combination of cosedimentation assays and microscope-based filamentous actin (F-actin)-bundling assays to show that CLIP-170 can bind directly to F-actin in vitro. By studying CLIP-170 fragments and mutants, we found that the F-actin-binding domain is independent of the formin-activating FEED domain, requires the second CLIP-170 cytoskeleton-associated protein glycine-rich (CAP-GLY) motif (i.e., CAP-GLY 2 or ""CG2"") for efficient binding, and overlaps with the MT-binding surface of the CAP-GLY domain. Consistent with these observations, our competition assays further indicate that CLIP-170 cannot bind to F-actin and MTs simultaneously. CLIP-170 overexpression did not have obvious effects on actin localization or morphology, initially arguing against the physiological significance of CLIP-170–F-actin interactions. However, effects of CLIP-170 overexpression might also be expected from the characterized indirect interactions between CLIP-170 and actin as described previously, indicating that this observation is difficult to interpret. As a parallel approach to studying the potential significance of CLIP-170–actin interactions, we used bioinformatics and identified a residue in CAP-GLY 2 that is important for binding to F-actin but not for binding to MTs. This residue is well conserved across a range of organisms within CAP-GLY 2 but not between CAP-GLY 2 and CAP-GLY 1, consistent with the idea that the interaction between CAP-GLY2 and F-actin is functionally significant. Previously, we characterized direct binding of the core +TIP EB1 to F-actin and proposed that this binding may function to reduce EB1 binding to MTs and thus destabilize MTs in the actin-rich periphery of the cell (24Alberico E.O. Zhu Z.C. Wu Y.O. Gardner M.K. Kovar D.R. Goodson H.V. Interactions between the microtubule binding protein EB1 and F-actin.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We speculate that binding of CLIP-170 to actin may function similarly, helping to destabilize MTs at the cell periphery.ResultsThe N-terminal “head” domain of CLIP-170 binds to F-actin directlyTo understand whether CLIP-170 might have a more direct role in actin–MT crosstalk, our first approach was to test whether CLIP-170 binds directly to F-actin in vitro using high-speed cosedimentation assays. We chose the CLIP-170 N-terminal fragment H2 (Fig. 1A; also known as the CLIP-170 MT-binding “head” domain fragment #2) for this test because the full-length CLIP-170 protein is easily degraded in vitro (25Scheel J. Pierre P. Rickard J.E. Diamantopoulos G.S. Valetti C. van der Goot F.G. Haner M. Aebi U. Kreis T.E. Purification and analysis of authentic CLIP-170 and recombinant fragments.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25883-25891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and is autoinhibited (26Lansbergen G. Komarova Y. Modesti M. Wyman C. Hoogenraad C.C. Goodson H.V. Lemaitre R.P. Drechsel D.N. van Munster E. Gadella Jr., T.W. Grosveld F. Galjart N. Borisy G.G. Akhmanova A. Conformational changes in CLIP-170 regulate its binding to microtubules and dynactin localization.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). After subtracting the background ∼4% of H2 that self-pelleted in the absence of F-actin, we found that ∼26% of H2 moved into the pellet in the presence of F-actin (3 μM) in our initial F-actin-binding assays (Fig. 1B). These results suggested that CLIP-170 can bind to F-actin directly via its N-terminal head domain.To better understand this CLIP-170–F-actin interaction, we performed a salt-sensitivity test. The fraction of H2 bound to 6 μM F-actin decreased with increasing salt concentration (Fig. 1C). This observation indicates that ionic interactions play a role in the CLIP-170–F-actin interactions. With these data, a buffer (PEM50; [50 mM PIPES, 2 mM MgCl, 1 mM EGTA, pH 6.8]) that has a potassium ion concentration equivalent to 75 mM was chosen for further analysis because this buffer allowed us to work with moderate F-actin concentrations and is consistent with salt concentrations used for other F-actin-binding studies in the literature (e.g., (28Skau C.T. Kovar D.R. Fimbrin and tropomyosin competition regulates endocytosis and cytokinesis kinetics in fission yeast.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 1415-1422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)).One question left open by the aforementioned salt-sensitivity test is whether CLIP-170 can bind to F-actin at physiological actin and salt concentrations. For comparison, F-actin concentrations in the cortex region can be higher than 300 μM (29Abraham V.C. Krishnamurthi V. Taylor D.L. Lanni F. The actin-based nanomachine at the leading edge of migrating cells.Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1721-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 30Koestler S.A. Rottner K. Lai F. Block J. Vinzenz M. Small J.V. F- and G-actin concentrations in lamellipodia of moving cells.PLoS One. 2009; 4e4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the physiological potassium ion concentration is ∼150 mM (27Thier S.O. Potassium physiology.Am. J. Med. 1986; 80: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because performing cosedimentation experiments at 300 μM F-actin is not practical, we tested the ability of H2 (4 μM) to cosediment with 50 μM F-actin (the highest concentration we could achieve) in 150 mM potassium ion. We observed that H2 did partially cosediment with the F-actin under these conditions (Fig. S1), consistent with the idea that CLIP-170–actin interaction could occur in cells, though it is weak.Taken together, these results indicate that the N-terminal domain of CLIP-170 can bind F-actin directly, and that this interaction is mediated at least partly by ionic interactions.The F-actin-binding and MT-binding regions of CLIP-170 overlap with each otherTo determine which region(s) of CLIP-170 are responsible for the CLIP-170–F-actin interaction, we measured the KD of various CLIP-170 N-terminal constructs with F-actin using high-speed cosedimentation assays (Fig. 2). These constructs were H2, as well as various CLIP-170 fragments containing one of the CG (CAP-GLY) domains, with or without their nearby S regions (serine-rich regions) (Fig. 2A). H2 is a dimer, and other CLIP-170 fragments are monomers (25Scheel J. Pierre P. Rickard J.E. Diamantopoulos G.S. Valetti C. van der Goot F.G. Haner M. Aebi U. Kreis T.E.

Note that we did not include H1 (a CLIP-170 N-terminal fragment with no coiled-coiled domain) in this test because the molecular weight of H1 is too similar to actin, and so the two proteins cannot be resolved with SDS-PAGE.Figure 2CLIP-170 binds to F-actin directly via CG2 and the surrounding serine-rich regions.

Curves were fitted to the data by OriginPro (simple binding equation with assumption of a 1:1 binding ratio with Bmax = 1). Error bars are standard deviation with n = 3.

This diagram shows that the CLIP-170 F-actin-binding and MT-binding regions overlap. In addition, the data indicate that CLIP-170 dimerization is not required for the CLIP-170–F-actin interactions because the coiled-coil region is not included in the F-actin-binding region.

In contrast, all constructs containing CG2 bound to F-actin. Cosedimentation assays indicated that the KD of F-actin–CG2 (∼90 μM) was approximately ninefold weaker than that of H2 (∼10 μM) (Fig. 2, B and C). With CG2-S3, the F-actin-binding affinity recovered to 20 μM (approximately twofold weaker than that of H2), and having both nearby S regions (S2-CG2-S3) fully restored the F-actin-binding affinity to a value similar to H2 (∼10 μM) (Fig. 2, B and C).These observations led to several conclusions: (1) the minimal F-actin-binding region for full-binding activity corresponds to CG2 and its bilateral serine-rich regions (S2-CG2-S3) (Fig. 2D), (2) the F-actin-binding region does not include the FEED domain identified as binding to formins (23Henty-Ridilla J.L.

Accelerated actin filament polymerization from microtubule plus ends.Science. 2016; 352: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), so this interaction is different from that involved in formin-dependent actin polymerization, (3) dimerization is not required for this interaction because S2-CG2-S3 has no coiled-coil domain, (4) the two CG domains are not equivalent—the CG2 subdomain plays a more important role in mediating F-actin binding than does the CG1 subdomain. In considering that CG2 is more important for binding to F-actin, it is interesting to note that CG2 is also more important for binding to MTs (32Mishima M. Maesaki R. Kasa M. Watanabe T. Fukata M.

Although cilia machinery is crucial in the eye for photoreceptor development and function, a role for cilia in early eye development and morphogenesis is still somewhat unclear: many zebrafish cilia mutants retain cilia at early stages due to maternal deposition of cilia components. An eye phenotype has been described in the mouse Arl13 mutant, however, zebrafish arl13b is maternally deposited, and an early role for cilia proteins has not been tested in zebrafish eye development. Here we use the zebrafish dzip1 mutant, which exhibits a loss of cilia throughout stages of early eye development, to examine eye development and morphogenesis. We find that in dzip1 mutants, initial formation of the optic cup proceeds normally, however, the optic fissure subsequently fails to close and embryos develop the structural eye malformation ocular coloboma. Further, neural crest cells, which are implicated in optic fissure closure, do not populate the optic fissure correctly, suggesting that their inappropriate localization may be the underlying cause of coloboma. Overall, our results indicate a role for dzip1 in proper neural crest localization in the optic fissure and optic fissure closure."
https://openalex.org/W4220835813,"Salivary scavenger and agglutinin (SALSA) is a secreted protein with various immunomodulatory roles. In humans, the protein agglutinates and inactivates microorganisms, and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Saliva, which is rich in SALSA, accelerates bacterial phagocytosis, but SALSA's contribution is unclear. In horses, the functions of SALSA in inflammation remain undetermined, so they were investigated through phagocytosis and cytokine assays. Equine SALSA was purified from duodenal tissue, which contains abundant SALSA. To assess phagocytosis, fluorescently-labelled bacteria were incubated with 20, 10, 5, or 2.5 μg/mL of SALSA or phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and then incubated at 37°C or on ice with whole blood from seven healthy horses. Fluorescence was measured by gating on neutrophils using a flow cytometer, and compared between groups. To assess effects on cytokine production, alveolar macrophages were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of five healthy horses and cultured in serum-free media for 24 hours with different concentrations of SALSA plus 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS), only LPS, or only media. Cytokines were measured in supernatant using an equine-specific multiplex bead immunoassay. There was significantly greater phagocytosis in samples incubated at 37°C compared to incubation on ice. Samples incubated with 20 μg/mL of SALSA at 37°C had less phagocytosis compared to samples with 10 or 2.5 μg/mL SALSA, or PBS. Alveolar macrophages incubated with SALSA plus LPS released significantly less CXC motif chemokine ligand 1, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, and tumor necrosis factor α, and more granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), compared to macrophages incubated with LPS alone. These findings indicate anti-inflammatory effects, which may be due to interference with toll-like receptor 4 recognition of LPS or downstream signaling. Increase in G-CSF following incubation with SALSA suggests a novel mechanism for immunoregulation of alveolar macrophages by SALSA, addressing a knowledge gap regarding its functions in horses."
https://openalex.org/W4220873181,"Intraguild predation (IGP) is common in the freshwater insect communities, involving a top predator, intraguild prey (IG prey) and a shared prey. Influence of the habitat complexity on the prey-predator interactions is well established through several studies. In the present instance, the IGP involving the heteropteran predators and the dipteran prey were assessed in the background of the habitat complexity. The three predators Diplonychus rusticus , Ranatra filiformis , and Laccotrephes griseus , one intraguild prey Anisops bouvieri and two dipteran prey Culex quinquefasciatus and Chironomus sp. were used in different relative density against the complex habitat conditions to deduce the impact on the mortality on the prey. In comparison to the open conditions, the presence of the macrophytes and pebbles reduced the mortality of the shared prey under intraguild system as well as single predator system. The mortality of the shared prey was however dependent on the density of the predator and prey. Considering the shared prey mortality, predation on mosquito larvae was always higher in single predator system than chironomid larvae irrespective of identity and density of predators. However, for both the shared prey, complexity of habitat reduced the prey vulnerability in comparison to the simple habitat condition. Higher observed prey consumption depicts the higher risk to predation of shared prey, though the values varied with habitat conditions. Mortality of IG prey ( A . bouvieri ) in IGP system followed the opposite trend of the shared prey. The lower mortality in simple habitat and higher mortality in complex habitat conditions was observed for the IG prey, irrespective of shared prey and predator density. In IGP system, the shared prey mortality was influenced by the habitat conditions, with more complex habitat reducing the vulnerability of the shared prey and increased mortality of the IG prey. This implies that the regulation of the mosquitoes, in the IGP system will be impeded by the habitat conditions, with the heteropteran predators as the top predator."
https://openalex.org/W4221050191,"Freeway networks are vulnerable to natural disasters and man-made disruptions. The closure of one or more toll stations of the network often causes a sharp decrease in freeway performance. Therefore, measuring the probability and consequences of vulnerability to identify critical parts in the network is crucial for road emergency management. Most existing techniques only measure the consequences of node closure and rarely consider the probability of node closure owing to the lack of an extensive historical database; moreover, they ignore highways outside the study area, which can lead to errors in topological analysis and traffic distribution. Furthermore, the negative effects produced by the operation of freeway tunnels in vulnerability assessment have been neglected. In this study, a framework for freeway vulnerability assessment that considers both the probability and consequences of vulnerability is proposed, based on the perspective of network cascade failure analysis. The cascade failure analysis is conducted using an improved coupled map lattice model, developed by considering the negative effects of tunnels and optimizing the rules of local traffic redistribution. The perturbation threshold and propagation time step of network cascade failure are captured to reflect the probabilities and consequences of vulnerability. A nodal vulnerability index is established based on risk assessment, and a hierarchical clustering method is used to identify the vulnerability classification of critical nodes. The freeway network of Fuzhou in China is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Specifically, the toll stations in the study area are classified into five clusters of vulnerability: extremely high, high, medium, low, and extremely low. Approximately 31% of the toll stations were classified as the high or extremely high cluster, and three extremely vulnerable freeway sections requiring different precautions were identified. The proposed network vulnerability analysis method provides a new perspective to examine the vulnerability of freeway networks."
https://openalex.org/W4221120839,"A discrimination-experiment method is developed to investigate the transient heat transfer of air jet impingement by discretizing the solid domain into mutually adiabatic test cylinders. This method can not only reduce the influence of the transverse heat transfer of a solid domain on the heat transfer characteristics of the jet but can also simplify the two-dimensional or three-dimensional heat conduction problem into a one-dimensional problem. Moreover, the discrimination-experiment method eliminates the embedment of thermocouples into the solid domains, further improving the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method. The transient heat transfer characteristics of a supersonic air jet impinging on a high-temperature target (860°C) and the effects of thermo physical parameters, such as the density, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and nozzle-to-target distance ( H/D = 3, 4, and 5) are analyzed in detail using the discrimination-experiment method. The results provide important guidance for the thermal design of supersonic air jet impingement."
