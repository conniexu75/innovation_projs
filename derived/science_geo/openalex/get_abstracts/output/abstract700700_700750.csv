https://openalex.org/W4296032638,"Although deep learning has revolutionized protein structure prediction, almost all experimentally characterized de novo protein designs have been generated using physically based approaches such as Rosetta. Here, we describe a deep learning-based protein sequence design method, ProteinMPNN, that has outstanding performance in both in silico and experimental tests. On native protein backbones, ProteinMPNN has a sequence recovery of 52.4% compared with 32.9% for Rosetta. The amino acid sequence at different positions can be coupled between single or multiple chains, enabling application to a wide range of current protein design challenges. We demonstrate the broad utility and high accuracy of ProteinMPNN using x-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and functional studies by rescuing previously failed designs, which were made using Rosetta or AlphaFold, of protein monomers, cyclic homo-oligomers, tetrahedral nanoparticles, and target-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4296025960,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder, with resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability being major symptoms1. Neuropathologically, it is characterized by the presence of abundant filamentous inclusions of α-synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in some brain cells, including dopaminergic nerve cells of the substantia nigra2. PD is increasingly recognised as a multisystem disorder, with cognitive decline being one of its most common non-motor symptoms. Many patients with PD develop dementia more than 10 years after diagnosis3. PD dementia (PDD) is clinically and neuropathologically similar to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is diagnosed when cognitive impairment precedes parkinsonian motor signs or begins within one year from their onset4. In PDD, cognitive impairment develops in the setting of well-established PD. Besides PD and DLB, multiple system atrophy (MSA) is the third major synucleinopathy5. It is characterized by the presence of abundant filamentous α-synuclein inclusions in brain cells, especially oligodendrocytes (Papp-Lantos bodies). We previously reported the electron cryo-microscopy structures of two types of α-synuclein filament extracted from the brains of individuals with MSA6. Each filament type is made of two different protofilaments. Here we report that the cryo-electron microscopy structures of α-synuclein filaments from the brains of individuals with PD, PDD and DLB are made of a single protofilament (Lewy fold) that is markedly different from the protofilaments of MSA. These findings establish the existence of distinct molecular conformers of assembled α-synuclein in neurodegenerative disease."
https://openalex.org/W4296031103,"Deep learning generative approaches provide an opportunity to broadly explore protein structure space beyond the sequences and structures of natural proteins. Here, we use deep network hallucination to generate a wide range of symmetric protein homo-oligomers given only a specification of the number of protomers and the protomer length. Crystal structures of seven designs are very similar to the computational models (median root mean square deviation: 0.6 angstroms), as are three cryo–electron microscopy structures of giant 10-nanometer rings with up to 1550 residues and C 33 symmetry; all differ considerably from previously solved structures. Our results highlight the rich diversity of new protein structures that can be generated using deep learning and pave the way for the design of increasingly complex components for nanomachines and biomaterials."
https://openalex.org/W4296029810,"Investment in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequencing in Africa over the past year has led to a major increase in the number of sequences that have been generated and used to track the pandemic on the continent, a number that now exceeds 100,000 genomes. Our results show an increase in the number of African countries that are able to sequence domestically and highlight that local sequencing enables faster turnaround times and more-regular routine surveillance. Despite limitations of low testing proportions, findings from this genomic surveillance study underscore the heterogeneous nature of the pandemic and illuminate the distinct dispersal dynamics of variants of concern-particularly Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron-on the continent. Sustained investment for diagnostics and genomic surveillance in Africa is needed as the virus continues to evolve while the continent faces many emerging and reemerging infectious disease threats. These investments are crucial for pandemic preparedness and response and will serve the health of the continent well into the 21st century."
https://openalex.org/W4296032784,"The gut microbiomes of human populations worldwide have many core microbial species in common. However, within a species, some strains can show remarkable population specificity. The question is whether such specificity arises from a shared evolutionary history (codiversification) between humans and their microbes. To test for codiversification of host and microbiota, we analyzed paired gut metagenomes and human genomes for 1225 individuals in Europe, Asia, and Africa, including mothers and their children. Between and within countries, a parallel evolutionary history was evident for humans and their gut microbes. Moreover, species displaying the strongest codiversification independently evolved traits characteristic of host dependency, including reduced genomes and oxygen and temperature sensitivity. These findings all point to the importance of understanding the potential role of population-specific microbial strains in microbiome-mediated disease phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W4296037511,"The authors analyzed data from multiple large-scale randomized experiments on LinkedIn's People You May Know algorithm, which recommends new connections to LinkedIn members, to test the extent to which weak ties increased job mobility in the world's largest professional social network. The experiments randomly varied the prevalence of weak ties in the networks of over 20 million people over a 5-year period, during which 2 billion new ties and 600,000 new jobs were created. The results provided experimental causal evidence supporting the strength of weak ties and suggested three revisions to the theory. First, the strength of weak ties was nonlinear. Statistical analysis found an inverted U-shaped relationship between tie strength and job transmission such that weaker ties increased job transmission but only to a point, after which there were diminishing marginal returns to tie weakness. Second, weak ties measured by interaction intensity and the number of mutual connections displayed varying effects. Moderately weak ties (measured by mutual connections) and the weakest ties (measured by interaction intensity) created the most job mobility. Third, the strength of weak ties varied by industry. Whereas weak ties increased job mobility in more digital industries, strong ties increased job mobility in less digital industries."
https://openalex.org/W4295929710,"Small-ring cage hydrocarbons are popular bioisosteres (molecular replacements) for commonly found para-substituted benzene rings in drug design1. The utility of these cage structures derives from their superior pharmacokinetic properties compared with their parent aromatics, including improved solubility and reduced susceptibility to metabolism2,3. A prime example is the bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane motif, which is mainly synthesized by ring-opening of the interbridgehead bond of the strained hydrocarbon [1.1.1]propellane with radicals or anions4. By contrast, scaffolds mimicking meta-substituted arenes are lacking because of the challenge of synthesizing saturated isosteres that accurately reproduce substituent vectors5. Here we show that bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes (BCHeps), which are hydrocarbons for which the bridgehead substituents map precisely onto the geometry of meta-substituted benzenes, can be conveniently accessed from [3.1.1]propellane. We found that [3.1.1]propellane can be synthesized on a multigram scale, and readily undergoes a range of radical-based transformations to generate medicinally relevant carbon- and heteroatom-substituted BCHeps, including pharmaceutical analogues. Comparison of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties of these analogues reveals enhanced metabolic stability relative to their parent arene-containing drugs, validating the potential of this meta-arene analogue as an sp3-rich motif in drug design. Collectively, our results show that BCHeps can be prepared on useful scales using a variety of methods, offering a new surrogate for meta-substituted benzene rings for implementation in drug discovery programmes."
https://openalex.org/W4295924750,"One of the most fundamental quantum states of light is squeezed vacuum, in which noise in one of the quadratures is less than the standard quantum noise limit. Significant progress has been made in the generation of optical squeezed vacuum and its utilization for numerous applications. However, it remains challenging to generate, manipulate, and measure such quantum states in nanophotonics with performances required for a wide range of scalable quantum information systems. Here, we overcome this challenge in lithium niobate nanophotonics by utilizing ultrashort-pulse phase-sensitive amplifiers for both generation and all-optical measurement of squeezed states on the same chip. We generate a squeezed state spanning over more than 25 THz of bandwidth supporting only a few optical cycles, and measure a maximum of 4.9 dB of squeezing ($\sim$11 dB inferred). This level of squeezing surpasses the requirements for a wide range of quantum information systems. Our results on generation and measurement of few-optical-cycle squeezed states in nanophotonics enable a practical path towards scalable quantum information systems with THz clock rates and open opportunities for studying non-classical nature of light in the sub-cycle regime."
https://openalex.org/W4296035091,"The generation of carbon radicals by halogen-atom and group transfer reactions is generally achieved using tin and silicon reagents that maximize the interplay of enthalpic (thermodynamic) and polar (kinetic) effects. In this work, we demonstrate a distinct reactivity mode enabled by quantum mechanical tunneling that uses the cyclohexadiene derivative γ-terpinene as the abstractor under mild photochemical conditions. This protocol activates alkyl and aryl halides as well as several alcohol and thiol derivatives. Experimental and computational studies unveiled a noncanonical pathway whereby a cyclohexadienyl radical undergoes concerted aromatization and halogen-atom or group abstraction through the reactivity of an effective H atom. This activation mechanism is seemingly thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable but is rendered feasible through quantum tunneling."
https://openalex.org/W4295932121,"Taste sensing is a sophisticated chemosensory process, and bitter taste perception is mediated by type 2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs), or class T G protein–coupled receptors. Understanding the detailed molecular mechanisms behind taste sensation is hindered by a lack of experimental receptor structures. Here, we report the cryo–electron microscopy structures of human TAS2R46 complexed with chimeric mini–G protein gustducin, in both strychnine-bound and apo forms. Several features of TAS2R46 are disclosed, including distinct receptor structures that compare with known GPCRs, a new “toggle switch,” activation-related motifs, and precoupling with mini–G protein gustducin. Furthermore, the dynamic extracellular and more-static intracellular parts of TAS2R46 suggest possible diverse ligand-recognition and activation processes. This study provides a basis for further exploration of other bitter taste receptors and their therapeutic applications."

https://openalex.org/W4296033360,"The origin and early diversification of jawed vertebrates involved major changes to skeletal and soft anatomy. Skeletal transformations can be examined directly by studying fossil stem gnathostomes; however, preservation of soft anatomy is rare. We describe the only known example of a three-dimensionally mineralized heart, thick-walled stomach, and bilobed liver from arthrodire placoderms, stem gnathostomes from the Late Devonian Gogo Formation in Western Australia. The application of synchrotron and neutron microtomography to this material shows evidence of a flat S-shaped heart, which is well separated from the liver and other abdominal organs, and the absence of lungs. Arthrodires thus show the earliest phylogenetic evidence for repositioning of the gnathostome heart associated with the evolution of the complex neck region in jawed vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W4296029180,"Mesenchymal stem cells can be obtained and multiplied from various sources and have a very high capacity to release exosomes. Exosomes are nano-sized extracellular vesicles containing biological signaling molecules. This study aimed to determine the effect of MSC-derived exosomes as a drug delivery system for paclitaxel in cervical cancer cells. In this study, human MSC were isolated from wharton jelly of umbilical cord tissue (WJ-MSC), and cells were characterized by CD44, CD90, CD105, and CD34 staining. Exosomes were released in WJ-MSC cells with serum-starved conditions for 48 hours, and particle sizes and structures were examined with zeta-sizer and TEM. In addition, exosomes CD9, CD63, and CD81 markers were checked by western blot. Paclitaxel was loaded into exosomes (Exo-PAC) by electroporation and then incubated with Hela cervical cancer cells for 24 hours. TGF-β, SMAD, Snail, Slug, β-catenin, Notch, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, Bax, Bcl-2 protein and gene expression levels were analyzed in Hela cells. As a result, low concentration Exo-PAC induced apoptosis, and suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition proteins in Hela cells. In this study, it has been demonstrated that WJ-MSCs can be used as drug delivery systems for cervical cancer if exosomes are produced scalably in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4296029766,"A quantum system's energy landscape may have points where multiple energy surfaces are degenerate and that exhibit singular geometry of the wave function manifold, with major consequences for the system's properties. Ultracold atoms in optical lattices have been used to indirectly characterize such points in the band structure. We measured the non-Abelian transformation produced by transport directly through the singularities. We accelerated atoms along a quasi-momentum trajectory that enters, turns, and then exits the singularities at linear and quadratic band-touching points of a honeycomb lattice. Measurements after transport identified the topological winding numbers of these singularities to be 1 and 2, respectively. Our work introduces a distinct method for probing singularities that enables the study of non-Dirac singularities in ultracold-atom quantum simulators."
https://openalex.org/W4295932265,"Chromosomal translocations result from the joining of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and frequently cause cancer. However, the steps linking DSB formation to DSB ligation remain undeciphered. We report that DNA replication timing (RT) directly regulates lymphomagenic Myc translocations during antibody maturation in B cells downstream of DSBs and independently of DSB frequency. Depletion of minichromosome maintenance complexes alters replication origin activity, decreases translocations, and deregulates global RT. Ablating a single origin at Myc causes an early-to-late RT switch, loss of translocations, and reduced proximity with the immunoglobulin heavy chain ( Igh ) gene, its major translocation partner. These phenotypes were reversed by restoring early RT. Disruption of early RT also reduced tumorigenic translocations in human leukemic cells. Thus, RT constitutes a general mechanism in translocation biogenesis linking DSB formation to DSB ligation."

https://openalex.org/W4295932289,"The origin of Saturn's ~26.7° obliquity and ~100-million-year-old rings is unknown. The observed rapid outward migration of Saturn's largest satellite, Titan, could have raised Saturn's obliquity through a spin-orbit precession resonance with Neptune. We use Cassini data to refine estimates of Saturn's moment of inertia, finding that it is just outside the range required for the resonance. We propose that Saturn previously had an additional satellite, which we name Chrysalis, that caused Saturn's obliquity to increase through the Neptune resonance. Destabilization of Chrysalis's orbit ~100 million years ago can then explain the proximity of the system to the resonance and the formation of the rings through a grazing encounter with Saturn."
https://openalex.org/W4296025962,"Global food security depends on the sustainability of irrigated agriculture. Rising groundwater withdrawals from seasonally humid, alluvial plains across tropical Asia have enabled dry-season rice cultivation. This groundwater pumpage increases available subsurface storage that under favorable conditions amplifies groundwater replenishment during the subsequent monsoon. We empirically quantified this nature-based solution to seasonal freshwater storage capture described as the ""Bengal Water Machine,"" revealing its potential and limitations. On the basis of a million piezometric observations from 465 monitoring wells, we show that the collective operation of ~16 million smallholder farmers in the Bengal Basin of Bangladesh from 1988 to 2018 has induced cumulative freshwater capture that volumetrically (75 to 90 cubic kilometers) is equivalent to twice the reservoir capacity of the Three Gorges Dam."
https://openalex.org/W4296035487,"Efforts to support flagging mentoring programs facing shortages of experienced clinical mentors have had an unexpected and welcome effect. Supplementing traditional mentoring programs with peer-mentoring have not only addressed gaps in practice, structure, support and mentee oversight but have offered mentees charged with peer-mentoring duties the opportunity to take on mentoring roles under senior supervision. This study evaluates the experiences of peer-mentors within a local research mentoring program to better understand and advance this endeavor.Semi-structured interviews and post-interview surveys based on recent reviews on mentoring were employed. Adapting the Systematic Evidence Based Approach, data was analysed using thematic and content analysis. Results were combined using the Jigsaw Perspective to ensure that key elements of the different mentoring stages were identified.The interviews and surveys revealed the following domains: Motivation, Initiation, Practicing, and Mentoring Environment.These findings provide novel insight into a structured framework that may help guide the experiences, training, assessment, and oversight of peer-mentors beyond the auspices of our local program. These general observations will equip host organizations with the direction they need to take in designing and executing peer-mentoring training and assessment programs of their own. Whilst the stages of peer-mentoring need further evaluation and an effective means of assessment and support pivotal, we believe our findings suggest that peer-mentoring may not only help to address the shortfall in mentors but is an invaluable learning experience that prepares and instils key values, beliefs and principles in young would-be mentors."
https://openalex.org/W4295901292,"This study exclusively contributes to the health-environment discourse by using mortality rates, carbon emissions (proxy for environmental degradation), renewable energy and real per capita income to investigate these intrinsic relationships. This study uses an unbalanced sample of 47 Sub-Saharan African countries from 2005-2019 to reveal that: (1) both carbon emissions and renewable energy are associated with higher mortality rates; (2) real per capita income is associated with reducing mortality rates; (3) per capita income attenuates the effect of renewable energy on mortality rates, (4) persistency in mortalities exist; and (5) the health-environment-energy-income dynamics differ across income groups. Additionally, this study submits that the interaction of renewable energy and real per capita income dampens the positive effect of renewable energy on mortality rates and supports the argument that income levels lessen the extent of mortalities. Besides, these results vividly show that real per capita income reduces the devastating effect of renewable energy on infant and under-5 mortality rates from 0.942% to 0.09%, 2.42% to 0.55%, 1.04% to 0.09% and 2.8% to 0.64% for high and middle-income countries, respectively. This is a novel and significant contribution to the health-environment literature. Hence, real per capita income is a crucial determinant of mortality rate. Policy recommendations are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4295906392,"The devastating impact of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic almost halted the global economy and is responsible for 6 million deaths with infection rates of over 524 million. With significant reservations, initially, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was suspected to be infected by and closely related to Bats. However, over the periods of learning and critical development of experimental evidence, it is found to have some similarities with several gene clusters and virus proteins identified in animal-human transmission. Despite this substantial evidence and learnings, there is limited exploration regarding the SARS-CoV-2 genome to putative microRNAs (miRNAs) in the virus life cycle. In this context, this paper presents a detection method of SARS-CoV-2 precursor-miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) that helps to identify a quick detection of specific ribonucleic acid (RNAs). The approach employs an artificial neural network and proposes a model that estimated accuracy of 98.24%. The sampling technique includes a random selection of highly unbalanced datasets for reducing class imbalance following the application of matriculation artificial neural network that includes accuracy curve, loss curve, and confusion matrix. The classical approach to machine learning is then compared with the model and its performance. The proposed approach would be beneficial in identifying the target regions of RNA and better recognising of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence to design oligonucleotide-based drugs against the genetic structure of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W4296026491,"The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of insomnia symptoms and to examine the associations of body mass index (BMI), chronic diseases, and lifestyle factors with self-reported insomnia symptoms among older people in India.We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the baseline wave of the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) that was collected during 2017-18. A sample of 31,358 older adults aged 60 and above was included in the analyses. Descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed to obtain the results.In this study, insomnia symptoms were reported by around 36 percent of older adults aged 60 and above. After controlling for socio-demographic factors, insomnia symptoms were positively associated with the risk of being underweight [AOR: 1.289, CI: 1.211-1.372] and negatively associated with obesity/overweight [AOR: 0.928, CI: 0.872-0.990] as compared to older adults with normal BMI. The odds of insomnia symptoms were higher among those who reported the following chronic conditions, i.e., hypertension [AOR:1.356, CI:1.278-1.438], diabetes [AOR:1.160, CI:1.074-1.254], chronic lung diseases [AOR:1.485, CI:1.351-1.632], bone-related diseases [AOR:1.561, CI:1.458-1.670] and any psychiatric disorders [AOR:1.761, CI:1.495-2.074]. In addition, older adults who were physically active [AOR: 0.850, CI:0.804-0.900] were less likely to report insomnia symptoms.The study suggests a high prevalence of insomnia symptoms among the older population in India. Early identification of the signs of insomnia in older population is crucial, as is timely treatment for any kind of sleep problems. In addition, nutrition-based interventions and individual disease-specific management programs may help minimize the stressful situations in later life and develop a good night's sleep for the older population."

Indeed, the siblings of these children are not insulated from these consequences and may experience elevated levels of psychological distress, placing them at increased risk for developing mental disorders. This protocol describes the methodology for a scoping review that will examine how mental disorders in children impact the mental health of their sibling(s). Further, we aim to examine the role of sex, gender, birth order, age of each child, and familial factors (e.g., parent mental illness, family structure), in sibling mental health. The proposed review will also identify resources that aim to support the needs of siblings of children with mental disorders. Taken together, this proposed review aims to take a fundamental step towards determining intervention targets to reduce the transmission of risk between siblings.The proposed scoping review aims to address the following questions: i) how do mental disorders (in children <18 years of age) impact the mental health of their sibling(s) (also <18 years of age)? ii) Can we identify resources designed to address the needs of siblings of children with mental disorders?We will conduct the proposed scoping review in keeping with the six-stage Arksey and O'Malley Framework and the scoping review methodology provided by the Joanna Briggs Institute. In section i) we outline our research questions. In section ii) we describe our process for identifying studies that examine the mental health of siblings of a child with a mental disorder and studies that provide evidence on resources directed specifically at these siblings. We will search peer-review and grey literature published between 2011 and 2022 from OVID MEDLINE, OVID EMBASE, CINAHL Complete, Proquest Nursing and Allied Health, PsycINFO (via APA platform), Proquest Sociology Collection and Web of Science Core Collection and Proquest Theses and Dissertations.

However, an operational issue related to this ingestion is the requirement for a high intake of 7.5 g·kg-1 to produce the desired effects. We investigated the effects of the intake of low amounts of ice slurry at -2°C on the tympanic temperature and exercise performance during repeated high-intensity intermittent exercises in a hot environment. This study was a randomized, crossover study, with a 6-day washout period. Twelve university rugby union players performed two 30-min sessions of high-intensity intermittent exercises separated by a 15-min half-time break on a cycle ergometer in a hot environment (28.8°C ± 0.1°C, 49.5% ± 0.6% relative humidity). The participants ingested 450 g of -2°C-ice slurry (ICE), or a 30°C-beverage (CON) having the same composition as ICE, or 30°C-water (WAT) during the half-time break. The tympanic temperature and skin temperature were measured as the physiological data, and the peak power and mean power as the exercise performance data. The tympanic temperature at the half-time break and beginning of the 2nd session was significantly lower in the ICE group as compared with the CON and WAT groups. The skin temperature at the half-time break was significantly lower in the ICE group as compared with the WAT group. While the peak power and mean power during the 2nd session were significantly greater in the ICE group as compared with the CON and WAT groups. Our findings suggest that even the intake of lower amounts, as compared with those used in previous studies, of low-temperature ice slurry can reduce the body temperature and improve the peak power. These results suggest that intake of low-temperature ice slurry as a strategy for internal body cooling is useful for improving endurance exercise performance in hot environments."

The average diameters and volumes of the nodules were measured on baseline and follow-up LDCTs with semi-automated segmentation. Sensitivities and specificities for lung cancer diagnosis of nodule growth defined by a) percentage volume growth ≥25% (defined in the NELSON study); b) absolute diameter growth >1.5 mm (defined in the Lung-RADS version 1.1); and c) subjective decision by a radiologist were evaluated. Sensitivities and specificities of diagnostic referral based on various thresholds of volume doubling time (VDT) were also evaluated.Altogether, 115 nodules (one nodule per individual; 93 solid and 22 part-solid nodules; 105 men; median age, 68 years) were evaluated (median follow-up interval: 201 days; interquartile range: 127-371 days). Percentage volume growth ≥25% exhibited higher sensitivity but lower specificity than those of diametrical measurement compared to absolute diameter growth >1.5 mm (sensitivity, 69.2% vs. 42.3%, p = 0.023; specificity, 82.0% vs. 96.6%, p = 0.002). The radiologist had an equivalent sensitivity (53.9%; p = 0.289) but higher specificity (98.9%; p = 0.002) compared to those of volume growth, but did not differ from those of diameter growth (p>0.05 both in sensitivity and specificity). Compared to the VDT threshold of 600 days (sensitivity, 61.5%; specificity, 87.6%), VDT thresholds ≤200 and ≤300 days exhibited significantly lower sensitivity (30.8%, p = 0.013) and higher specificity (94.4%, p = 0.041), respectively.Growth evaluation of screening-detected indeterminate nodules with volumetric measurement exhibited higher sensitivity but lower specificity compared to diametric measurements."
https://openalex.org/W4296026608,"According to the global burden of disease 5.5 million deaths were attributable to stroke. The stroke mortality rate is estimated to be seven times higher in low-income countries compared to high-income countries. The main aim of the study was to assess the 28 days case fatality rate and its determinants among admitted stroke patients in public referral hospitals, in Northwest Ethiopia. A hospital-based prospective cohort study was conducted from December 2020 to June 2021. The study population was 554 stroke patients. Based on Akakian Information Criteria, the Gompertz model was fitted to predict the hazard of death. The study included admitted stroke patients who were treated in the general medical ward and neurology ward. The mean age of the participants was 61 ± 12.85 years and 53.25% of the patients were female. The 28-days case fatality rate of stroke was 27.08%. The results from Gompertz parametric baseline hazard distribution revealed that female sex adjusted hazard rate (AHR = 0.27, 95% CI:0.18-0.42), absence of a family history of chronic disease (AHR = 0.50, 95%CI:0.29-0.87), good GCS score (AHR = 0.21, 95% CI:0.09-0.50) and the absence of complication during hospital admission (AHR = 0.16, 95% CI:0.08-0.29) were factors which decrease hazard of 28 days case fatality rate. While, hemorrhagic stroke sub-type (AHR = 1.38, 95% CI:1.04-3.19), time from symptom onset to hospital arrival (AHR = 1.49, 95% CI:1.57-2 .71), time from confirmation of the diagnosis to initiation of treatment (AHR = 1.03, 95% CI:1.01-1.04), a respiratory rate greater than 20 (AHR = 7.21, 95% CI:3.48-14.9), and increase in NIHSS score (AHR = 1.16, 95% CI:1.10-1.23) were factors increasing hazard of 28 days case fatality rate of stroke. At 28-days follow-up, more than one-fourth of the patients have died. The establishment of separate stroke centers and a network of local and regional stroke centers with expertise in early stroke evaluation and management may address challenges."

The intervention group was frail, elderly patients with home healthcare in the municipality of Skellefteå, registered in the Swedish quality registry RiksSar for ulcer treatment with hard-to-heal venous leg ulcer. The control group with equivalent physical conditions was obtained from the same quality registry. Definition of hard-to-heal ulcer was six weeks duration or more. The PBM was performed two times per week with laser type infrared GaAs, 904nm, 60mW, and 700Hz, targeting lymphatic area and ulcer area. Laser type red visible, GaAllnp, 635nm, 75mW and 250Hz, targeting ulcer area. The intervention group treated with PBM in addition to traditional dressing healed significantly faster than the control group with a mean of 123 days (p = 0.0001). Duration of the ulcer before PBM did not impact the healing time. To conclude, the findings indicate that using PBM in addition to dressing may have multiple benefits on hard-to-heal venous leg ulcer, saving valuable time and resources for patients, healthcare providers, and institutions."

Here we report existence of a physiological internal strain gradient (pre-strain) across the BCU at the ultrastructural scale of the extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents, specifically the collagen fibril. We use X-ray scattering that probes changes in the axial periodicity of fibril-level D-stagger of tropocollagen molecules in the matrix fibrils, as a measure of microscopic pre-strain. We find that mineralized collagen nanofibrils in the calcified plate are in tensile pre-strain relative to the underlying trabecular bone. This behaviour contrasts with the previously accepted notion that fibrillar pre-strain (or D-stagger) in collagenous tissues always reduces with mineralization, via reduced hydration and associated swelling pressure. Within the calcified part of the BCU, a finer-scale gradient in pre-strain (0.6% increase over ~50μm) is observed. The increased fibrillar pre-strain is linked to prior research reporting large tissue-level residual strains under compression. The findings may have biomechanical adaptative significance: higher in-built molecular level resilience/damage resistance to physiological compression, and disruption of the molecular-level pre-strains during remodelling of the bone-cartilage interface may be potential factors in osteoarthritis-based degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4295932127,"Intimate-partner factors have a significant effect on the uptake of services that affect maternal reproductive health outcomes. There is limited research on intimate-partner factors associated with cervical cancer screening. Therefore, this article examines the intimate-partner correlates of cervical cancer screening among married women in Central Uganda. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Wakiso and Nakasongola districts in Central Uganda. A total of 656 married women aged 25-49 participated in the study. Frequency distributions for descriptive statistics and Pearson chi-squared tests were done to identify the association of selected individual explanatory variables and intimate-partner factors with cervical cancer screening. Finally, multivariable complementary log-log regressions were used to estimate intimate-partner factors associated with women's cervical cancer screening uptake in Central Uganda. About 2 in 10 (20%) of the participants had been screened for cervical cancer. The following characteristics when examined separately in relation to the uptake of cervical cancer screening service and were significant: woman's age, education attainment, occupation, wealth index, parity, male partner's age, and male partner's emotional support. After adjusting for independent factors, cervical cancer screening was significantly associated with women who had; attained secondary (AOR = 2.19; CI 1.18-4.06) compared to none/ primary education, and received partner's emotional support (AOR = 30.06; CI 13.44-67.20) compared to those who did not receive partner's emotional support. In Central Uganda, cervical cancer screening among married women was significantly associated with women's education, and partner's emotional support. These factors point to the importance of intimate-partner factors. Therefore, more effort should be directed at encouraging men's participation. This should be supplemented with empowering women through education to increase uptake of screening services."
https://openalex.org/W4295932264,"Background Increasing brain exposure of biotherapeutics is key to success in central nervous system disease drug discovery. Accessing the brain parenchyma is especially difficult for large polar molecules such as biotherapeutics and antibodies because of the blood-brain barrier. We investigated a new immunization strategy to identify novel receptors mediating transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier. Method We immunized mice with primary non-human primate brain microvascular endothelial cells to obtain antibodies. These antibodies were screened for their capacity to bind and to be internalized by primary non-human primate brain microvascular endothelial cells and Human Cerebral Microvascular Endothelial Cell clone D3. They were further evaluated for their transcytosis capabilities in three in vitro blood-brain barrier models. In parallel, their targets were identified by two different methods and their pattern of binding to human tissue was investigated using immunohistochemistry. Results 12 antibodies with unique sequence and internalization capacities were selected amongst more than six hundred. Aside from one antibody targeting Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule and one targeting Striatin3, most of the other antibodies recognized β1 integrin and its heterodimers. The antibody with the best transcytosis capabilities in all blood-brain barrier in vitro models and with the best binding capacity was an anti-αnβ1 integrin. In comparison, commercial anti-integrin antibodies performed poorly in transcytosis assays, emphasizing the originality of the antibodies derived here. Immunohistochemistry studies showed specific vascular staining on human and non-human primate tissues. Conclusions This transcytotic behavior has not previously been reported for anti-integrin antibodies. Further studies should be undertaken to validate this new mechanism in vivo and to evaluate its potential in brain delivery."
https://openalex.org/W4296026040,"In order to improve the accuracy and stability of runoff prediction. This study proposed a dynamic model averaging method with Time-varying weight (TV-DMA). Using this method, an integrated prediction model framework for runoff prediction was constructed. The framework determines the main variables suitable for runoff prediction through correlation analysis, and uses TV-DMA and deep learning algorithm to construct an integrated prediction model for runoff. The results demonstrate that the current monthly runoff, the runoff of the previous month, the current monthly temperature, the temperature of the previous month and the current monthly rainfall were the variables suitable for runoff prediction. The results of runoff prediction show that the TV-DMA model has the highest prediction accuracy (with 0.97 Nash-efficiency coefficient (NSE)) and low uncertainty. The interval band of uncertainty was 33.3%-65.5% lower than single model. And the prediction performance of the single model and TV-DMA model in flood season is obviously lower than that in non-flood season. In addition, this study indicate that the current monthly runoff, rainfall and temperature are the important factor affecting the runoff prediction, which should be paid special attention in the runoff prediction."

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate if using these features improves speech perception in noise, subjective listening effort, and sound quality.In this prospective longitudinal study, twenty adult SONNET users were fitted with the SONNET 2 audio processor, configured either as a default SONNET (no ANR/TNR/AI), with mild ANR/TNR, with strong ANR/TNR, with mild AI, and with strong AI. Speech perception in noise was assessed in speech and stationary noise from the front (S0N0); speech, stationary noise, and transient noise from the front (S0N0T0); and speech from the front in spatially-distributed stationary noise (S0N±45N±135). Listening effort, subjective sound quality, and device/setup preference were assessed.In the S0N0 setup, speech perception in noise was significantly better with the SONNET 2 when using ANR/TNR in the mild setup than with the SONNET or the SONNET 2 in the default SONNET configuration. In the S0N±45N±135 setup, speech understanding was significantly better in all four SONNET 2 configurations than with the SONNET or the SONNET 2 in the default SONNET configuration (a 1.26-2.55 dB SRT80 benefit). Subjects tolerated consistently lower signal-to-noise values with the SONNET 2 configurations using ANR/TNR than with the default SONNET configuration in all listening effort categories. All SONNET 2 configurations using ANR/TNR were preferred and better rated in speech in stationary and/or transient noise compared to the default SONNET configuration. Sound quality and pleasantness were better in those SONNET 2 configurations. Subjects strongly preferred the SONNET 2 configurations over the SONNET configuration.The new front-end features implemented in the SONNET 2 audio processor objectively improve speech perception in noise. Subjects preferred the SONNET 2, over the SONNET, in the presence of stationary and transient noise."
https://openalex.org/W4296035489,"Introduction Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) is the most widely used Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) drug due to its potency, safety profile and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation. TDF causes proximal tubular renal dysfunction (PTRD) leading to Fanconi syndrome, acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. Modest rates (2–4%) of TDF related toxicity based on estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) have been described, while TDF-induced PTRD has been reported to be 22%. TDF toxicity is more likely among African patients, it is reversible and TDF may be renal dosed in patients with dysfunction. The objective of this study was to assess proximal tubular renal dysfunction, global renal function, and their determinants among patients on TDF versus TDF-sparing regimen. Methods This was a cross-sectional study among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) attending the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) program. The primary outcome of interest in this study was PTRD while the secondary outcome of interest was estimated GFR. PTRD was defined as any two of beta-2 microglobulin in urine, metabolic acidosis, normoglycemic glucosuria and fractional excretion of phosphate. Student’s t-test, chi-square and their non-parametric equivalents were used to test for statistical significance. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out. Results A total of 516 participants were included in the final analysis, 261 on TDF while 255 were on TDF-sparing regimens. The mean (SD) age of all participants was 41.5 (12.6) years with majority being female (60.3%). The proportion of PTRD was 10.0% versus 3.1% in the TDF compared to TDF-sparing group (P&lt;0.001). Mean estimated GFR was 112.8 (21.5) vs 109.7 (21.9) ml/min/1.73mm 3 (P = 0.20) for the TDF compared to TDF-sparing group. TDF users were more likely to have PTRD compared to non-TDF users, adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 3.0, 95% CI 1.12 to 7.75. Conclusion There was significant PTRD in the TDF compared to TDF-sparing group without significant difference in estimated GFR. The clinical significance of these findings may not be clear in the short term."
https://openalex.org/W4296037861,"There is a lack of comprehensive instruments for the assessment of compliance with influenza immunization. The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric characteristics of the Health Belief Model Applied to Influenza (HBMAI) among people with chronic diseases. We selected people residing in four municipalities of the Foča region (Republic of Srpska-Bosnia and Herzegovina) who were listed in the official records to receive the recommended influenza immunization in 2017/2018. Participants were interviewed using the HBMAI questionnaire at their homes. The HBMAI is composed of 45 items classified in 7 domains (Susceptibility, Seriousness, Benefits, Barriers, Knowledge, Health Motivation and Cue to Action). The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) suggested that the Serbian HBMAI did not fit the original structure. The parallel analysis suggested that HBMAI in Serbian had 6 domains, instead of the original 7. The domain of ""Knowledge"" was removed. The domains of ""Barriers"", ""Health Motivation"" and ""Cue to Action"" preserved their original structure. The domains of ""Susceptibility"", ""Seriousness"" and ""Benefits"" were partially modified. The parameters on the CFA for the new modified HBMAI in Serbian were acceptable (goodness of fit index [GFI] = 0.946, comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.967, Tucker-Lewis index [TLI] = 0.963, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.044 and standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] = 0.078). This modified HBMAI version with 6 domains, not including the Knowledge domain, is recommended for use in research about influenza among people with chronic diseases in Serbian language."
https://openalex.org/W4295898261,"Introduction Vaccination has dramatically reduced invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease worldwide. Hib vaccination was introduced in the Lao PDR in 2009, as part of the pentavalent vaccine. To contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology of Hib in Lao PDR and the protection levels before and after the introduction of the vaccination, we tested serum samples from existing cohorts of vaccine age-eligible children and unvaccinated adolescents for antibodies against Hib. Methods Serum samples from 296 adolescents born before vaccine introduction and from 1017 children under 5 years (vaccinated and unvaccinated) were tested for anti-Hib antibodies by ELISA. Bivariate analyses were performed to investigate factors associated with long-term protection. Results The vast majority of all participants showed evidence of short- (42.7%) or long-term (56.1%) protection against Hib. Almost all of the unvaccinated adolescents had antibody titers indicating short-term protection and almost half (45.6%) were long-term protected. Nearly all children (&gt;99.0%) were at least short-term protected, even those that were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown. Among vaccinated children, participants vaccinated more than 1 or 2 years ago and with a mid-upper arm circumference z-score &lt; -2 were less likely to be long-term protected. Discussion Nearly all adolescents born before the introduction of Hib vaccination in the Lao PDR had antibody titers corresponding to at least short-term protection, indicating a high burden of Hib disease at that time. After vaccine introduction, all but four children (&gt;99%) showed at least short-term protection. Possible explanations for the proportion of protected, yet apparently unvaccinated children, may be past infections, cross-reacting antibodies or faulty vaccination documentation. Our results highlight the need for robust surveillance and reporting of invasive Hib disease to determine the burden of disease despite vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4295900270,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common degenerative motor neuron disorder. Although most cases of ALS are sporadic, 5-10% of cases are familial, with mutations associated with over 40 genes. There is variation of ALS symptoms within families carrying the same mutation; the disease may develop in one sibling and not in another despite the presence of the mutation in both. Although the cause of this phenotypic variation is unknown, it is likely related to genetic modifiers of disease expression. The identification of ALS causing genes has led to the development of transgenic mouse models of motor neuron disease. Similar to families with familial ALS, there are background-dependent differences in disease phenotype in transgenic mouse models of ALS suggesting that, as in human ALS, differences in phenotype may be ascribed to genetic modifiers. These genetic modifiers may not cause ALS rather their expression either exacerbates or ameliorates the effect of the mutant ALS causing genes. We have reported that in both the G93A-hSOD1 and G59S-hDCTN1 mouse models, SJL mice demonstrated a more severe phenotype than C57BL6 mice. From reciprocal intercrosses between G93A-hSOD1 transgenic mice on SJL and C57BL6 strains, we identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on mouse chromosome 17 that results in a significant shift in lifespan. In this study we generated reciprocal intercrosses between transgenic G59S-hDCTN1 mice on SJL and C57BL6 strains and identified survival QTLs on mouse chromosomes 17 and 18. The chromosome 17 survival QTL on G93A-hSOD1 and G59S-hDCTN1 mice partly overlap, suggesting that the genetic modifiers located in this region may be shared by these two ALS models despite the fact that motor neuron degeneration is caused by mutations in different proteins. The overlapping region contains eighty-seven genes with non-synonymous variations predicted to be deleterious and/or damaging. Two genes in this segment, NOTCH3 and Safb/SAFB1, have been associated with motor neuron disease. The identification of genetic modifiers of motor neuron disease, especially those modifiers that are shared by SOD1 and dynactin-1 transgenic mice, may result in the identification of novel targets for therapies that can alter the course of this devastating illness."
https://openalex.org/W4295904093,"Background Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) has been used with the therapeutic intent to change the functions of the gut microbial community in metabolism and host immunity. For most of these therapies, the recipients are not given antibiotics to eliminate the microbial community prior to transplant with donor fecal microbes resulting in the initial gut microbial community following FMT consisting of a consortium of donor and recipient microbes. The detailed analysis of the fecal samples from these FMT over time provides a unique opportunity to study the changes in the gut microbial strain community that occurs following the introduction of new microbial strains (donor) into an established community (recipient). Methods In this study, we have metagenomic data set consisting of 5 FMT that contained donor, recipient and recipient post FMT taken multiple times for periods up to 535 days after the FMT. We used two established strain tracking methods, Window-based Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) Similarity (WSS) and StrainPhlAn, to determine the presence of donor and recipient microbial strains following FMT. To assess recombination between donor and recipient strains of Bacteroides vulgatus post FMT, we used BLAST+ to analyze the data sets for Bacteroidales -specific antimicrobial proteins (BSAP-3) that have known functions to restrict species specific replication. Results We found that Alistipes onderdonkii , Alistipes shahii , Alistipes putredinis , and Parabacteroides merdae , all had patterns post FMT consisting of either dominant donor or recipient microbial strains in the feces. In contrast, the analysis of Bacteroides spp . in five FMT pairs revealed inter-individual oscillation over time with the appearance of either donor or recipient fecal strain dominance. In some instances, B . vulgatus and B . uniformis were also identified after FMT that were not related to either the donor or recipient. Finally, in one of the FMT, we identified a distinct B . vulgatus strain post-FMT that matched the pre-FMT strain but was BSAP-3 positive, suggesting a possible recombination event between the donor and recipient strains. Conclusion The complex oscillating patterns of the appearance of fecal dominant donor, recipient or unrelated strains following extended times post FMT provide new insights into the dynamics of the microbial community interactions with the recipients following FMT. The result from our analysis has implications for the use of FMT to predictably change the biological functions of the gut community in metabolism and host immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4295906217,"The study of natural language using a network approach has made it possible to characterize novel properties ranging from the level of individual words to phrases or sentences. A natural way to quantitatively evaluate similarities and differences between spoken and written language is by means of a multiplex network defined in terms of a similarity distance between words. Here, we use a multiplex representation of words based on orthographic or phonological similarity to evaluate their structure. We report that from the analysis of topological properties of networks, there are different levels of local and global similarity when comparing written vs. spoken structure across 12 natural languages from 4 language families. In particular, it is found that differences between the phonetic and written layers is markedly higher for French and English, while for the other languages analyzed, this separation is relatively smaller. We conclude that the multiplex approach allows us to explore additional properties of the interaction between spoken and written language."
https://openalex.org/W4295907995,"Although research on learning strategies has contributed to improving learners' performance, most studies only described the characteristics of learners. These approaches have focused on inter-individual differences and their correlations, making it difficult to examine the process of selecting learning strategies in individuals. To examine the correlations within individual learners, such as the variables that influence the use of a strategy by a specific learner, two surveys were conducted in this study. Perceived cost and perceived benefit of using each strategy as the influential variables on choosing a strategy were adopted with reference to decision-making research. Perceived cost consisted of the time perspective for learning outcomes by the learning strategy and the method of learning strategy implementation. In Study 1, cognitive strategies that have a direct impact on the acquisition of learning content were measured, and metacognitive strategies that monitor and regulate one's own learning behavior were examined in Study 2. The variables were treated for each individual to calculate intra-class and within-person correlations, although data were collected using a typical questionnaire survey in learning strategy studies. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling was conducted with use of the learning strategy as the objective variable and the perceived costs and benefits as explanatory variables. The analysis revealed that, in terms of cognitive strategies (Study 1), learners avoided using learning strategies perceived to have a high cost in the short term; however, they used cognitive strategies regardless of the circumstances. Furthermore, regarding metacognitive strategies (Study 2), students avoided using learning strategies that they perceived as costly to use in the short term and used them only when they suited the circumstances. On the other hand, in metacognitive strategies (Study 2), students avoided using learning strategies that they perceived as costly to use for the next test and use as appropriate for the situation. Focusing on within-individual variance and correlation made the interpretation of factors that influence the choice of learning strategies more intuitive and provided more suggestions for educational practice."
https://openalex.org/W4295924166,"Agave lechuguilla Torr., of the family Agavaceae, is distributed from southwestern United States to southern Mexico and is one of the most representative species of arid and semiarid regions. Its fiber is extracted for multiple purposes. The objective of this study was to generate a robust model to predict dry fiber yield (Dfw) rapidly, simply, and inexpensively. We used a power model in its linear form and bioclimatic areas as dummy variables. Training, generation (80%) and validation (20%) of the model was performed using machine learning with the package 'caret' of R. Using canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we evaluated the relationship of Dwf to bioclimatic variables. The principal components analysis (PCA) generated two bioclimatic zones, each with different A. lechuguilla productivities. We evaluated 499 individuals in four states of Mexico. The crown diameter (Cd) of this species adequately predicts its fiber dry weight (R2 = 0.6327; p < 0.05). The intercept (β0), slope [lnCd (β1)], zone [(β2)] and interaction [lnCd:Zona (β3)] of the dummy model was statistically significant (p < 0.05), giving origin to an equation for each bioclimatic zone. The CCA indicates a positive correlation between minimum temperature of the coldest month (Bio 6) and Dwf (r = 0.84 and p < 0.05). In conclusion, because of the decrease in Bio 6 of more than 0.5°C by 2050, the species could be vulnerable to climate change, and A. lechuguilla fiber production could be affected gradually in the coming years."

Better understanding of ICU physicians' perceptions, attitudes, and knowledge about antimicrobial prescribing practices could facilitate more effective interventions in fighting antimicrobial resistance in Egyptian ICUs and establishing a proper Antimicrobial Stewardship Program.A cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted including 92 physicians distributed across the different types of Egyptian healthcare institutions in two cities of Egypt; Cairo and El Monufia. Over a period of three months, started in December 2019 and ended in February 2020.A total of 92 Egyptian physicians were included in the study. Seventy (76.1%) of the surveyed physician strongly agreed and 22 (23.9%) agreed that antibiotic resistance is a worldwide problem. Moreover, 50 (54.3%) strongly agreed and 40 (43.4%) agreed that it is a problem in their hospitals while only 2 (2.1%) disagreed. Poor hand hygiene (67.5%), poor infection control practices by healthcare professionals (63.9%) as well as wrong practices in the management of invasive devices (68.7%), and poor environmental cleaning practices (63.4%) were considered very important causes of AMR by the majority of the surveyed ICU physicians. Almost all of the physicians (95%) rated an advice from a clinical pharmacist as very or moderately helpful intervention, while (52%) declared an advice from a microbiologist or an infectious disease specialist as very helpful.The results of the present study showed that the Egyptian ICU physicians have remarkable knowledge regarding antibiotic resistance as a worldwide problem and a high sensibility toward the problem in their hospitals. The study also showed that implementation of proper AMS is an urgent need as physicians answers for the different questions in the survey showed that their attitudes and perceptions regarding antibiotic resistance and their way in prescription could be modified and improved if AMS programs with suitable training programs and local guidelines are provided among different types of Egyptian hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W4296027044,"Mental health problems are prevalent among China’s internal migrant workers. However, research on the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and mental health is insufficient. Therefore, this study, utilizing the China’s National Dynamic Monitoring Survey data from a sample of 15,997 migrant workers aged 15–59 years to explore differences in the relationship between migrants’ objective and subjective SES and mental health status in 2015. Both the mediating effect of perceived interpersonal discrimination and the moderating effect of age were examined through structural equation modeling. The results indicated that subjective SES has a stronger direct relationship with mental health than objective SES. Perceived interpersonal discrimination mediated the association between subjective SES and mental health. Furthermore, a much stronger relationship was found between subjective SES and perceived interpersonal discrimination among migrants older than 24 years of age than younger migrant groups. The results showed that, compared with traditional objective SES indicators, subjective SES could be a more sensitive index for identifying those migrant workers with a high risk of mental health problems. In addition, reducing interpersonal discrimination toward migrants can alleviate their mental health problems. And we should pay more attention to older migrant workers since they are more likely to prone to interpersonal discrimination and mental health issues."

This study explored the therapeutic effects of EA in rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) and evaluated its possible mechanisms in promoting angiogenesis. To evaluate the effect of EA, we used 2, 3, 5-Triphenyl-2H-Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC) staining and behavior score to calculate the cerebral infarct volume and neurological deficit score after CIRI. Western blot (WB) analysis was employed to evaluate the expression of cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34), erythropoietin (EPO), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and phospho-Src (p-Src) in the brain of the rats with CIRI. On the other hand, we established an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury model using brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), and analyzed cell viability and expression of VEGF or p-Src using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and WB, respectively. Our data showed that EA at the GV26 acupoint could significantly promote the expression of CD34, EPO, VEGF and p-Src in CIRI rats. Our CCK-8 results demonstrated that intervention with recombinant EPO and VEGF proteins remarkably improved the viability of BMECs after OGD/R, while a Src inhibitor, PP1, reversed this phenotype. The WB results showed that the recombinant EPO protein increased the expression of VEGF and p-Src, which was significantly inhibited by PP1. Taken together, our findings showed that EA at the GV26 acupoint can significantly attenuate ischemic injury after stroke and promote angiogenesis via activation of EPO-mediated Src and VEGF signaling pathways. Besides, the upregulation of VEGF may also be associated with the activation of Src by EPO."

https://openalex.org/W4296028779,"Intraoral scans became part of the virtual planning in Dentistry. In the new scenario of digital workflows, dental clinics and laboratories had to establish an online communication that requires the compression, decompression, and transmission of 3D files. Knowledge about the effects of these procedures on the dimensional properties of the files is fundamental to ensure a more realistic virtual planning. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of 3D file compression, decompression, and online transmission on the dimensional properties of dental models from intraoral scanning. Intraoral scan files in.stl format of 50 patients were selected from the database of a dental radiology clinic, with 25 of these patients with mixed dentition and 25 with permanent dentition. The maxilla and mandible scans of each patient were included in the study, generating a total of 100 files. A folder with the 100 files was created and replicated six times with different labels (A, B, C, D, E, F), totaling a sample number of 600 files. Folder A was compressed by WinZip and then decompressed. Folder B went through the same process, but the step of compression and decompression by WinZip was repeated 10 times. The folders C, D, E, F were sent, respectively, through the platforms WeTransfer, Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive, then each of them was downloaded in their respective platforms. After the six folders went through the compression process and were sent by the platforms, each file in the folder was compared with its original file by superimposing the 3D images and identifying the dimensional deviation in the compressed file in relation to the original file. We observed that there were no differences between the six groups regarding dimensional changes from the compression, decompression and online transmission processes. The lack of dimensional changes was observed for the sets of permanent and deciduous. teeth We concluded that it is possible to compress, decompress, and transfer.stl format files online without causing dimensional distortions in the 3D model."
https://openalex.org/W4296035434,"Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with multiple, high b-values is critical for extracting tissue microstructure measurements; however, high b-value DWI images contain high noise levels that can overwhelm the signal of interest and bias microstructural measurements. Here, we propose a simple denoising method that can be applied to any dataset, provided a low-noise, single-subject dataset is acquired using the same DWI sequence. The denoising method uses a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and deep learning to learn from a low-noise dataset, voxel-by-voxel. The trained model can then be applied to high-noise datasets from other subjects. We validated the 1D-CNN denoising method by first demonstrating that 1D-CNN denoising resulted in DWI images that were more similar to the noise-free ground truth than comparable denoising methods, e.g., MP-PCA, using simulated DWI data. Using the same DWI acquisition but reconstructed with two common reconstruction methods, i.e. SENSE1 and sum-of-square, to generate a pair of low-noise and high-noise datasets, we then demonstrated that 1D-CNN denoising of high-noise DWI data collected from human subjects showed promising results in three domains: DWI images, diffusion metrics, and tractography. In particular, the denoised images were very similar to a low-noise reference image of that subject, more than the similarity between repeated low-noise images (i.e. computational reproducibility). Finally, we demonstrated the use of the 1D-CNN method in two practical examples to reduce noise from parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice acquisition. We conclude that the 1D-CNN denoising method is a simple, effective denoising method for DWI images that overcomes some of the limitations of current state-of-the-art denoising methods, such as the need for a large number of training subjects and the need to account for the rectified noise floor."
