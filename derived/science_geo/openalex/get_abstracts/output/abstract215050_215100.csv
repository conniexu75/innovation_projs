https://openalex.org/W2101885480,"In tissue culture, immune lymph node cells containing foreign histocompatibility antigens of the H-2 type exert marked cytotoxic effects on tumor cells incompatible with the H-2 antigen. An equally pronounced effect is obtained when normal allogeneic and semi-isologous lymphoid cells of F(1) hybrids are caused to aggregate around the target tumor cells by treating the cultures with either heat-inactivated rabbit antiserum to mouse cells or phytohemagglutinin. Isologous lymph node cells have no effect. Thus, aggregation of lymphoid cells and target cells is a necessary but insufficient requirement for cytotoxicity in vitro; in addition, close contact must be established between histoincompatible cells."

https://openalex.org/W2107489016,"It has become evident in the past few years that there exists a considerable number of enzymes with activities that are markedly affected by compounds (metabolites) which are not substrates for the reaction involved. It has become equally evident that in many cases these effects are or may be of considerable physiological importance. The concept of feedback inhibition which describes the situation in which the product of a series of consecutive enzymatic reactions specifically inhibits the first of these steps is an excellent example of this type of effect (1). In such cases the effect may be considered to be physiological since it prevents the accumulation of excessive amounts of the product and directs the substrate of the first of the enzymes in the series to other metabolic pathways. In other cases, the physiological effect of compounds unrelated to the substrate on the rate of the enzymatic reaction may not be so simple, but these effects are probably of great importance in metabolic control and regulation. The purpose of the present paper is to attempt to combine two aspects of the problems relating to this type of enzyme. On the one hand, experimental kinetic treatments have been made on the particular enzymes which have shown these effects, but in many instances the kinetic properties have not been fully investigated and the full kinetic implications have not been realized. On the other hand, theoretical kinetic treatments, dealing with the effects of “modifiers” on enzymatic reactions have been described, but the full implication of what the physiological effects might be and how to treat such cases was not fully examined. Presented here is an attempt to deal with the question of how to treat the data for enzymes which are influenced by substances binding specifically to sites other than the enzymatically active site. Such binding is assumed, of course, to give rise to either activation or inhibition, and these cases will be dealt with in considerable detail."

https://openalex.org/W130076198,"The presence of dialyzable hydroxyproline-containing peptides in plasma and urine has been known for some time. Although their exact significance is not clear, the levels of these peptides in the absence of collagen or gelatin in the diet are a reflection of endogenous collagen metabolism. In a previous publication it was shown that, in addition to free hydroxyproline and dialyzable hydroxyproline peptides, there is also present in human plasma a form of hydroxyproline which is nondialyzable, precipitable with protein precipitants, and released by acid or alkaline hydrolysis. The presence in plasma protein hydrolysates of material which interferes with the procedure for hydroxyproline assay made it difficult to quantify or characterize this protein. It has now been possible to modify the existing procedure for hydroxyproline assay to make it sufficiently specific and sensitive for this purpose. With the modified procedure it has been found that plasma from laboratory animals and humans contains 6 to 14 mug per ml of protein-bound hydroxyproline. The behavior of this protein (hypro-protein) to ammonium sulfate precipitation and its migration on Sephadex columns suggest that it is a large molecule. Its resistance to digestion by chymotrypsin and Pronase suggests further that the protein may be a form of collagen."

Repeated recrystallization yielded preparations of maximum specific activity; such preparations revealed only one component when subjected to polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis. Studies with the ultracentrifuge demonstrated that urokinase undergoes a concentration-dependent reversible association at pH 6.8. When the partial specific volume of the enzyme is assumed to be 0.735 milliliters per gram at 10 degrees C, Archibald measurements indicate the molecular weight of urokinase to be 53,000."

https://openalex.org/W2112143954,"The adrenal glucocorticoids regulate carbohydrate formation and protein synthesis (l-6), but the mechanism by which they influence either of these processes remains to be elucidated. The administration of glucocorticoids to rats is followed by increased formation of several liver enzymes that participate in amino acid degradation or gluconeogenesis; e.g. tyrosineol-ketoglutarate transaminase (7), glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (8), glucose 6-phosphatase (9, lo), fructose 1 ,B-diphosphatase (10, II), glycogen synthetase (12), tryptophan pyrrolase (13)) phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (14, 15)) and pyruvic carboxylase (16). Karlson (17) has suggested that several hormones may function by stimulating enzyme synthesis and considerable evidence from the literature may be cited in support of this concept (18, 19). Greengard, Weber, and Singhal (20) have postulated that “the regulatory effect of glucocorticoids may be brought about by action on the cellular concentration of certain enzyme proteins.” Their proposal was based on data showing that glycogen formation in rats given cortisone plus either actinomycin D or puromycin was less than the amount of glycogen formed by rats given cortisone alone. Weber, Singhal, and Stamm (21) and Kenny and Ku11 (22) have reiterated this postulate. The concept that the primary effect of glucocorticoids is on enzyme induction is not in agreement with the previous findings of Kvam and Parks (10) that ethionine did not diminish the early effects of hydrocortisone on blood glucose and liver glycogen in fasted, adrenalectomized rats. Segal and Lopez (23) have questioned the proposal of Greengard et al. (20). The results of t,he present investigation indicate that the primary effect of glucocorticoids is not on induction of enzyme formation, although the latter process may be required for the maximum expression of the hormones’ activity."

These cell processes contain elementary neurosecretory granules, Golgi membranes, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting synthesis and possibly release of hormonal material. Each ""dendrite"" is provided with a single cilium which has an accessory centriole and a striated rootlet."

https://openalex.org/W2107807836,"(Received for publication, January 27, 1964) The introduction of an external radioisotopic label on the insulin molecule has permitted extensive invest.igations into the disposal of this polypeptide hormone in biological fluids (l-3). It has been observed that, following its injection into mammals, ‘311-insulin is rapidly modified as reflected by increased solubility of serum radioactivity in trichloroacetic acid and by the demon- stration of radioactivity migrating in the c,2-globulin and albumin regions on paper electrophoresis (4-6). It has also been shown that as a result of protracted incubation of 1311-insulin with serum at 37” in vitro, radiolabeled compounds occur with electrophoretic mobilities similar to those found in serum after administration of i3iI-insulin (5, 7). The raljid inactivation of insulin in vivo has been considered to result from disruption of this molecule by an intracellular enzyme with a major specificity for insulin (3, 8-11). Mirsky"

https://openalex.org/W2088718891,The rate of incorporation of glucosamine into the glycoprotein of reticulocyte stroma is greatly increased in thalassemia. This increase suggests a major enzymic disorder in the buildup of cellular membrane and reconciles the accumulation of material showing a positive reaction with periodic acid Schiff reagent with the clinical picture of oligocythemia and microcytosis.
