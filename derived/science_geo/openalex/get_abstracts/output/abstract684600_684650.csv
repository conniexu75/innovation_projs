https://openalex.org/W3216019834,"The B.1.1.7 variant (also known as Alpha) of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerged in the UK in the summer of 2020. The prevalence of this variant increased rapidly owing to an increase in infection and/or transmission efficiency1. The Alpha variant contains 19 nonsynonymous mutations across its viral genome, including 8 substitutions or deletions in the spike protein that interacts with cellular receptors to mediate infection and tropism. Here, using a reverse genetics approach, we show that of the 8 individual spike protein substitutions, only N501Y resulted in consistent fitness gains for replication in the upper airway in a hamster model as well as in primary human airway epithelial cells. The N501Y substitution recapitulated the enhanced viral transmission phenotype of the eight mutations in the Alpha spike protein, suggesting that it is a major determinant of the increased transmission of the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the N501Y substitution increased the affinity of the viral spike protein for cellular receptors. As suggested by its convergent evolution in Brazil, South Africa and elsewhere2,3, our results indicate that N501Y substitution is an adaptive spike mutation of major concern."

https://openalex.org/W3217498804,"Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is prevalent in human cancers and mediates high expression of oncogenes through gene amplification and altered gene regulation1. Gene induction typically involves cis-regulatory elements that contact and activate genes on the same chromosome2,3. Here we show that ecDNA hubs—clusters of around 10–100 ecDNAs within the nucleus—enable intermolecular enhancer–gene interactions to promote oncogene overexpression. ecDNAs that encode multiple distinct oncogenes form hubs in diverse cancer cell types and primary tumours. Each ecDNA is more likely to transcribe the oncogene when spatially clustered with additional ecDNAs. ecDNA hubs are tethered by the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) protein BRD4 in a MYC-amplified colorectal cancer cell line. The BET inhibitor JQ1 disperses ecDNA hubs and preferentially inhibits ecDNA-derived-oncogene transcription. The BRD4-bound PVT1 promoter is ectopically fused to MYC and duplicated in ecDNA, receiving promiscuous enhancer input to drive potent expression of MYC. Furthermore, the PVT1 promoter on an exogenous episome suffices to mediate gene activation in trans by ecDNA hubs in a JQ1-sensitive manner. Systematic silencing of ecDNA enhancers by CRISPR interference reveals intermolecular enhancer–gene activation among multiple oncogene loci that are amplified on distinct ecDNAs. Thus, protein-tethered ecDNA hubs enable intermolecular transcriptional regulation and may serve as units of oncogene function and cooperative evolution and as potential targets for cancer therapy. Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) congregates in clusters called ecDNA hubs that promote intermolecular interactions between gene-regulatory regions and thereby amplify the expression of oncogenes such as MYC in cancer cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W3215906447,"Humans spend a lifetime learning, storing and refining a repertoire of motor memories. For example, through experience, we become proficient at manipulating a large range of objects with distinct dynamical properties. However, it is unknown what principle underlies how our continuous stream of sensorimotor experience is segmented into separate memories and how we adapt and use this growing repertoire. Here we develop a theory of motor learning based on the key principle that memory creation, updating and expression are all controlled by a single computation-contextual inference. Our theory reveals that adaptation can arise both by creating and updating memories (proper learning) and by changing how existing memories are differentially expressed (apparent learning). This insight enables us to account for key features of motor learning that had no unified explanation: spontaneous recovery1, savings2, anterograde interference3, how environmental consistency affects learning rate4,5 and the distinction between explicit and implicit learning6. Critically, our theory also predicts new phenomena-evoked recovery and context-dependent single-trial learning-which we confirm experimentally. These results suggest that contextual inference, rather than classical single-context mechanisms1,4,7-9, is the key principle underlying how a diverse set of experiences is reflected in our motor behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3215189266,"Efficient frequency shifting and beam splitting are important for a wide range of applications, including atomic physics1,2, microwave photonics3–6, optical communication7,8 and photonic quantum computing9–14. However, realizing gigahertz-scale frequency shifts with high efficiency, low loss and tunability—in particular using a miniature and scalable device—is challenging because it requires efficient and controllable nonlinear processes. Existing approaches based on acousto-optics6,15–17, all-optical wave mixing10,13,18–22 and electro-optics23–27 are either limited to low efficiencies or frequencies, or are bulky. Furthermore, most approaches are not bi-directional, which renders them unsuitable for frequency beam splitters. Here we demonstrate electro-optic frequency shifters that are controlled using only continuous and single-tone microwaves. This is accomplished by engineering the density of states of, and coupling between, optical modes in ultralow-loss waveguides and resonators in lithium niobate nanophotonics28. Our devices, consisting of two coupled ring-resonators, provide frequency shifts as high as 28 gigahertz with an on-chip conversion efficiency of approximately 90 per cent. Importantly, the devices can be reconfigured as tunable frequency-domain beam splitters. We also demonstrate a non-blocking and efficient swap of information between two frequency channels with one of the devices. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a scheme for cascaded frequency shifting that allows shifts of 119.2 gigahertz using a 29.8 gigahertz continuous and single-tone microwave signal. Our devices could become building blocks for future high-speed and large-scale classical information processors7,29 as well as emerging frequency-domain photonic quantum computers9,11,14. Engineering of the coupling between optical modes in a lithium niobate chip enables the realization of tunable, bi-directional and low-loss electro-optic frequency shifters controlled using only continuous and single-tone microwaves."
https://openalex.org/W3216063992,"Endogenous DNA damage can perturb transcription, triggering a multifaceted cellular response that repairs the damage, degrades RNA polymerase II and shuts down global transcription1–4. This response is absent in the human disease Cockayne syndrome, which is caused by loss of the Cockayne syndrome A (CSA) or CSB proteins5–7. However, the source of endogenous DNA damage and how this leads to the prominent degenerative features of this disease remain unknown. Here we find that endogenous formaldehyde impedes transcription, with marked physiological consequences. Mice deficient in formaldehyde clearance (Adh5−/−) and CSB (Csbm/m; Csb is also known as Ercc6) develop cachexia and neurodegeneration, and succumb to kidney failure, features that resemble human Cockayne syndrome. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we find that formaldehyde-driven transcriptional stress stimulates the expression of the anorexiogenic peptide GDF15 by a subset of kidney proximal tubule cells. Blocking this response with an anti-GDF15 antibody alleviates cachexia in Adh5−/−Csbm/m mice. Therefore, CSB provides protection to the kidney and brain against DNA damage caused by endogenous formaldehyde, while also suppressing an anorexic endocrine signal. The activation of this signal might contribute to the cachexia observed in Cockayne syndrome as well as chemotherapy-induced anorectic weight loss. A plausible evolutionary purpose for such a response is to ensure aversion to genotoxins in food. Endogenous formaldehyde accumulation reveals Cockayne syndrome in mice and stimulates production of the anorexiogenic peptide GDF15 in proximal tubule cells."

https://openalex.org/W3160019297,"Solids in nature can be generally classified into crystalline and non-crystalline states1-7, depending on whether long-range lattice periodicity is present in the material. The differentiation of the two states, however, could face fundamental challenges if the degree of long-range order in crystals is significantly reduced. Here we report a paracrystalline state of diamond that is distinct from either crystalline or amorphous diamond8-10. The paracrystalline diamond reported in this work, consisting of sub-nanometre-sized paracrystallites that possess a well-defined crystalline medium-range order up to a few atomic shells4,5,11-13, was synthesized in high-pressure high-temperature conditions (for example, 30 GPa and 1,600 K) employing face-centred cubic C60 as a precursor. The structural characteristics of the paracrystalline diamond were identified through a combination of X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission microscopy and advanced molecular dynamics simulation. The formation of paracrystalline diamond is a result of densely distributed nucleation sites developed in compressed C60 as well as pronounced second-nearest-neighbour short-range order in amorphous diamond due to strong sp3 bonding. The discovery of paracrystalline diamond adds an unusual diamond form to the enriched carbon family14-16, which exhibits distinguishing physical properties and can be furthered exploited to develop new materials. Furthermore, this work reveals the missing link in the length scale between amorphous and crystalline states across the structural landscape, having profound implications for recognizing complex structures arising from amorphous materials."
https://openalex.org/W3216922660,"Heavy fermion systems represent one of the paradigmatic strongly correlated states of matter. They have been used as a platform for investigating exotic behavior ranging from quantum criticality and non-Fermi liquid behavior to unconventional topological superconductivity. Heavy fermions arise from the exchange interaction between localized magnetic moments and conduction electrons that leads to the well-known Kondo effect. In a Kondo lattice, the interaction between the localized moments gives rise to a band with heavy effective mass. This intriguing phenomenology has so far only been realized in compounds containing rare-earth elements with 4f or 5f electrons. Here, we realize a designer van der Waals heterostructure where artificial heavy fermions emerge from the Kondo coupling between a lattice of localized magnetic moments and itinerant electrons in a 1T/1H-TaS$_2$ heterostructure. We study the heterostructure using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) and show that depending on the stacking order of the monolayers, we can either reveal the localized magnetic moments and the associated Kondo effect, or the conduction electrons with a heavy-fermion hybridization gap. Our experiments realize an ultimately tuneable platform for future experiments probing enhanced many-body correlations, dimensional tuning of quantum criticality, and unconventional superconductivity in two-dimensional artificial heavy-fermion systems."
https://openalex.org/W3215994910,"The cell is a multi-scale structure with modular organization across at least four orders of magnitude1. Two central approaches for mapping this structure—protein fluorescent imaging and protein biophysical association—each generate extensive datasets, but of distinct qualities and resolutions that are typically treated separately2,3. Here we integrate immunofluorescence images in the Human Protein Atlas4 with affinity purifications in BioPlex5 to create a unified hierarchical map of human cell architecture. Integration is achieved by configuring each approach as a general measure of protein distance, then calibrating the two measures using machine learning. The map, known as the multi-scale integrated cell (MuSIC 1.0), resolves 69 subcellular systems, of which approximately half are to our knowledge undocumented. Accordingly, we perform 134 additional affinity purifications and validate subunit associations for the majority of systems. The map reveals a pre-ribosomal RNA processing assembly and accessory factors, which we show govern rRNA maturation, and functional roles for SRRM1 and FAM120C in chromatin and RPS3A in splicing. By integration across scales, MuSIC increases the resolution of imaging while giving protein interactions a spatial dimension, paving the way to incorporate diverse types of data in proteome-wide cell maps. Protein immunofluorescence imaging and affinity purification–mass spectrometry are combined to create a unified map of human cell architecture across scales, which the authors call the multi-scale integrated cell (MuSIC)."

https://openalex.org/W3216677617,"Lung cancer is one of the most aggressive tumour types. Targeted therapies stratified by oncogenic drivers have substantially improved therapeutic outcomes in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)1. However, such oncogenic drivers are not found in 25-40% of cases of lung adenocarcinoma, the most common histological subtype of NSCLC2. Here we identify a novel fusion transcript of CLIP1 and LTK using whole-transcriptome sequencing in a multi-institutional genome screening platform (LC-SCRUM-Asia, UMIN000036871). The CLIP1-LTK fusion was present in 0.4% of NSCLCs and was mutually exclusive with other known oncogenic drivers. We show that kinase activity of the CLIP1-LTK fusion protein is constitutively activated and has transformation potential. Treatment of Ba/F3 cells expressing CLIP1-LTK with lorlatinib, an ALK inhibitor, inhibited CLIP1-LTK kinase activity, suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis. One patient with NSCLC harbouring the CLIP1-LTK fusion showed a good clinical response to lorlatinib treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first description of LTK alterations with oncogenic activity in cancers. These results identify the CLIP1-LTK fusion as a target in NSCLC that could be treated with lorlatinib."
https://openalex.org/W3217383311,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) catalyses the deamination of deoxycytidines to deoxyuracils within immunoglobulin genes to induce somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination1,2. AID-generated deoxyuracils are recognized and processed by subverted base-excision and mismatch repair pathways that ensure a mutagenic outcome in B cells3–6. However, why these DNA repair pathways do not accurately repair AID-induced lesions remains unknown. Here, using a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we show that FAM72A is a major determinant for the error-prone processing of deoxyuracils. Fam72a-deficient CH12F3-2 B cells and primary B cells from Fam72a−/− mice exhibit reduced class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation frequencies at immunoglobulin and Bcl6 genes, and reduced genome-wide deoxyuracils. The somatic hypermutation spectrum in B cells from Fam72a−/− mice is opposite to that observed in mice deficient in uracil DNA glycosylase 2 (UNG2)7, which suggests that UNG2 is hyperactive in FAM72A-deficient cells. Indeed, FAM72A binds to UNG2, resulting in reduced levels of UNG2 protein in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, coinciding with peak AID activity. FAM72A therefore causes U·G mispairs to persist into S phase, leading to error-prone processing by mismatch repair. By disabling the DNA repair pathways that normally efficiently remove deoxyuracils from DNA, FAM72A enables AID to exert its full effects on antibody maturation. This work has implications in cancer, as the overexpression of FAM72A that is observed in many cancers8 could promote mutagenesis. FAM72A differentially controls mutation rates by regulating uracil processing at different stages of the cell cycle, thereby regulating somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination in B cells."

https://openalex.org/W3216388661,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that regulates important functions in the central nervous system1,2. The ALK gene is a hotspot for chromosomal translocation events that result in several fusion proteins that cause a variety of human malignancies3. Somatic and germline gain-of-function mutations in ALK were identified in paediatric neuroblastoma4–7. ALK is composed of an extracellular region (ECR), a single transmembrane helix and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain8,9. ALK is activated by the binding of ALKAL1 and ALKAL2 ligands10–14 to its ECR, but the lack of structural information for the ALK-ECR or for ALKAL ligands has limited our understanding of ALK activation. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography to determine the atomic details of human ALK dimerization and activation by ALKAL1 and ALKAL2. Our data reveal a mechanism of RTK activation that allows dimerization by either dimeric (ALKAL2) or monomeric (ALKAL1) ligands. This mechanism is underpinned by an unusual architecture of the receptor–ligand complex. The ALK-ECR undergoes a pronounced ligand-induced rearrangement and adopts an orientation parallel to the membrane surface. This orientation is further stabilized by an interaction between the ligand and the membrane. Our findings highlight the diversity in RTK oligomerization and activation mechanisms. Cryo-electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography are used to provide structural and mechanistic details of the activation of anaplastic lymphoma kinase by the ligands ALKAL1 and ALKAL2."
https://openalex.org/W3216098551,"Neutrinos exist in one of three types or ‘flavours’—electron, muon and tau neutrinos—and oscillate from one flavour to another when propagating through space. This phenomena is one of the few that cannot be described using the standard model of particle physics (reviewed in ref. 1), and so its experimental study can provide new insight into the nature of our Universe (reviewed in ref. 2). Neutrinos oscillate as a function of their propagation distance (L) divided by their energy (E). Therefore, experiments extract oscillation parameters by measuring their energy distribution at different locations. As accelerator-based oscillation experiments cannot directly measure E, the interpretation of these experiments relies heavily on phenomenological models of neutrino–nucleus interactions to infer E. Here we exploit the similarity of electron–nucleus and neutrino–nucleus interactions, and use electron scattering data with known beam energies to test energy reconstruction methods and interaction models. We find that even in simple interactions where no pions are detected, only a small fraction of events reconstruct to the correct incident energy. More importantly, widely used interaction models reproduce the reconstructed energy distribution only qualitatively and the quality of the reproduction varies strongly with beam energy. This shows both the need and the pathway to improve current models to meet the requirements of next-generation, high-precision experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande (Japan)3 and DUNE (USA)4. Electron scattering measurements are shown to reproduce only qualitatively state-of-the-art lepton–nucleus energy reconstruction models, indicating that improvements to these particle-interaction models are required to ensure the accuracy of future high-precision neutrino oscillation experiments."

https://openalex.org/W3215572466,"The proto-oncogene ALK encodes anaplastic lymphoma kinase, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed primarily in the developing nervous system. After development, ALK activity is associated with learning and memory1 and controls energy expenditure, and inhibition of ALK can prevent diet-induced obesity2. Aberrant ALK signalling causes numerous cancers3. In particular, full-length ALK is an important driver in paediatric neuroblastoma4,5, in which it is either mutated6 or activated by ligand7. Here we report crystal structures of the extracellular glycine-rich domain (GRD) of ALK, which regulates receptor activity by binding to activating peptides8,9. Fusing the ALK GRD to its ligand enabled us to capture a dimeric receptor complex that reveals how ALK responds to its regulatory ligands. We show that repetitive glycines in the GRD form rigid helices that separate the major ligand-binding site from a distal polyglycine extension loop (PXL) that mediates ALK dimerization. The PXL of one receptor acts as a sensor for the complex by interacting with a ligand-bound second receptor. ALK activation can be abolished through PXL mutation or with PXL-targeting antibodies. Together, these results explain how ALK uses its atypical architecture for its regulation, and suggest new therapeutic opportunities for ALK-expressing cancers such as paediatric neuroblastoma."

https://openalex.org/W3215374130,"Task-related information is widely distributed across the brain with different coding properties, such as persistency. We found in mice that coding persistency of action history and value was variable across areas, learning phases, and task context, with the highest persistency in the retrosplenial cortex of expert mice performing value-based decisions where history needs to be maintained across trials. Persistent coding also emerged in artificial networks trained to perform mouse-like reinforcement learning. Persistency allows temporally untangled value representations in neuronal manifolds where population activity exhibits cyclic trajectories that transition along the value axis after action outcomes, collectively forming cylindrical dynamics. Simulations indicated that untangled persistency facilitates robust value retrieval by downstream networks. Even leakage of persistently maintained value through non-specific connectivity could contribute to the brain-wide distributed value coding with different levels of persistency. These results reveal that context-dependent, untangled persistency facilitates reliable signal coding and its distribution across the brain."

To assess mechanisms SARS-CoV-2 responsible of tissue infection and vascular injury, correlating with thrombotic damage, specimens of the digestive tract positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were analyzed deriving from three patients, negative to naso-oro-pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. These COVID-19–negative patients came to clinical observation due to urgent abdominal surgery that removed different sections of the digestive tract after thrombotic events. Immunohistochemical for the expression of SARS-CoV-2 combined with a panel of SARS-CoV-2 related proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147), human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 was performed. Tissue samples were also evaluated by electron microscopy for ultrastructural virus localization and cell characterization. The damage of the tissue was assessed by ultrastructural analysis. It has been observed that CD147 expression levels correlate with SARS-CoV-2 infection extent, vascular damage and an increased expression of VEGF and thrombosis. The confirmation of CD147 co-localization with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding on gastrointestinal tissues and the reduction of the infection level in intestinal epithelial cells after CD147 neutralization, suggest CD147 as a possible key factor for viral susceptibility of gastrointestinal tissue. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of gastrointestinal tissue might be consequently implicated in abdominal thrombosis, where VEGF might mediate the vascular damage."

The impact of pregnancy and prenatal choline supplementation on choline and its metabolome in free-living, healthy adults is relatively uncharacterized. This study investigated the effect of prenatal choline supplementation on maternal and fetal biomarkers of choline metabolism among free-living pregnant persons consuming self-selected diets. Participants were randomized to supplemental choline (as choline chloride) intakes of 550 mg/d (500 mg/d d0-choline + 50 mg/d methyl-d9-choline; intervention) or 25 mg/d d9-choline (control) from gestational week (GW) 12-16 until Delivery. Fasting blood and 24-h urine samples were obtained at study Visit 1 (GW 12-16), Visit 2 (GW 20-24), and Visit 3 (GW 28-32). At Delivery, maternal and cord blood and placental tissue samples were collected. Participants randomized to 550 (vs. 25) mg supplemental choline/d achieved higher (p < .05) plasma concentrations of free choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and sphingomyelin at one or more study timepoint. Betaine was most responsive to prenatal choline supplementation with increases (p ≤ .001) in maternal plasma observed at Visit 2-Delivery (relative to Visit 1 and control), as well as in the placenta and cord plasma. Notably, greater plasma enrichments of d3-PC and LDL-C were observed in the intervention (vs. control) group, indicating enhanced PC synthesis through the de novo phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase pathway and lipid export. Overall, these data show that prenatal choline supplementation profoundly alters the choline metabolome, supporting pregnancy-related metabolic adaptations and revealing biomarkers for use in nutritional assessment and monitoring during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3165731488,"A band of intense rainfall extends more than 1,000 km along Mexico's west coast during Northern Hemisphere summer, constituting the core of the North American monsoon1,2. As in other tropical monsoons, this rainfall maximum is commonly thought to be thermally forced by emission of heat from land and elevated terrain into the overlying atmosphere3-5, but a clear understanding of the fundamental mechanism governing this monsoon is lacking. Here we show that the core North American monsoon is generated when Mexico's Sierra Madre mountains deflect the extratropical jet stream towards the Equator, mechanically forcing eastward, upslope flow that lifts warm and moist air to produce convective rainfall. These findings are based on analyses of dynamic and thermodynamic structures in observations, global climate model integrations and adiabatic stationary wave solutions. Land surface heat fluxes do precondition the atmosphere for convection, particularly in summer afternoons, but these heat fluxes alone are insufficient for producing the observed rainfall maximum. Our results indicate that the core North American monsoon should be understood as convectively enhanced orographic rainfall in a mechanically forced stationary wave, not as a classic, thermally forced tropical monsoon. This has implications for the response of the North American monsoon to past and future global climate change, making trends in jet stream interactions with orography of central importance."

Therefore, we investigated the nasal bacterial community of 47 healthy individuals working in a clinical research laboratory in Kuwait. The taxonomic profiling and core microbiome analysis identified three pre-dominant genera as Corynebacterium (15.0%), Staphylococcus (10.3%) and, Moraxella (10.0%). All the bacterial genera exhibited seasonal variations in summer, winter, autumn and spring. SparCC correlation network analysis revealed positive and negative correlations among the classified genera.

Community structure profiling indicated that the entire bacterial population followed a seasonal distribution (R 2 -0.371; P &lt; 0.001). Other demographic factors such as age, gender and, ethnicity contributed minimally towards community clustering in a closed indoor laboratory setting. Intra-personal diversity also witnessed rich species variety (maximum 6.8 folds).

The Arabic CAS was internally consistent and concurrently valid. These preliminary findings suggest that the Arabic CAS is a valid and reliable instrument to employ in the assessment of dysfunctional anxiety related to coronavirus.

Whether the BMP receptor deficiency found in the genetic form of PAH is also involved in SLE-PAH patients remains to be identified. In this study, we employed patient-derived samples from SLE-associated PAH (SLE-PAH) and established comparable mouse models to clarify the role of BMP signaling in the pathobiology of SLE-PAH. Firstly, serum levels of LPS and autoantibodies (auto-Abs) directed at BMP receptors were significantly increased in patients with SLE-PAH compared with control subjects, measured by ELISA. Mass cytometry was applied to compare peripheral blood leukocyte phenotype in patients prior to and after treatment with steroids, which demonstrated inflammatory cells alteration in SLE-PAH. Furthermore, BMPR2 signaling and pyroptotic factors were examined in human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) in response to LPS stimulation. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and E-selectin (SELE) expressions were up-regulated in autologous BMPR2+/R899X endothelial cells and siBMPR2-interfered PAECs. A SLE-PH model was established in mice induced with pristane and hypoxia. Moreover, the combination of endothelial specific BMPR2 knockout in SLE mice exacerbated pulmonary hypertension. Pyroptotic factors including gasdermin D (GSDMD) were elevated in the lungs of SLE-PH mice, and the pyroptotic effects of serum samples isolated from SLE-PAH patients on PAECs were analyzed. BMPR2 signaling upregulator (BUR1) showed anti-pyroptotic effects in SLE-PH mice and PAECs. Our results implied that deficiencies of BMPR2 signaling and proinflammatory factors together contribute to the development of PAH in SLE."

A disease-causing mutation, Kv3.3-G592R, causes overstimulation of Tank Binding Kinase 1 (Tbk1) in the cerebellum, resulting in the degradation of Hax-1 by promoting its trafficking into multivesicular bodies and then to lysosomes. We have now tested the effects of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) directed against the Kv3.3 channel on both wild type mice and those bearing the Kv3.3-G592R-encoding mutation. Intracerebroventricular infusion of the Kcnc3-specific ASO suppressed both mRNA and protein levels of the Kv3.3 channel. In wild-type animals, this produced no change in levels of activated Tbk1, Hax-1 or Cd63, a tetraspanin marker for late endosomes/multivesicular bodies. In contrast, in mice homozygous for the Kv3.3-G592R-encoding mutation, the same ASO reduced Tbk1 activation and levels of Cd63, while restoring the expression of Hax-1 in the cerebellum. The motor behavior of the mice was tested using a rotarod assay. Surprisingly, the active ASO had no effects on the motor behavior of wild type mice but restored the behavior of the mutant mice to those of age-matched wild type animals. Our findings indicate that, in mature intact animals, suppression of Kv3.3 expression can reverse the deleterious effects of a SCA13 mutation while having little effect on wild type animals. Thus, targeting Kv3.3 expression may prove a viable therapeutic approach for SCA13."
https://openalex.org/W4226029488,"Cell nuclei behave as viscoelastic materials. Dynamic regulation of the viscoelastic properties of nuclei in living cells is crucial for diverse biological and biophysical processes, specifically for intranuclear mesoscale viscoelasticity, through modulation of the efficiency of force propagation to the nucleoplasm and gene expression patterns. However, how the intranuclear mesoscale viscoelasticity of stem cells changes with differentiation is unclear and so is its biological significance. Here, we quantified the changes in intranuclear mesoscale viscoelasticity during osteoblastic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells. This analysis revealed that the intranuclear region is a viscoelastic solid, probably with a higher efficiency of force transmission that results in high sensitivity to mechanical signals in the early stages of osteoblastic differentiation. The intranuclear region was noted to alter to a viscoelastic liquid with a lower efficiency, which is responsible for the robustness of gene expression toward terminal differentiation. Additionally, evaluation of changes in the mesoscale viscoelasticity due to chromatin decondensation and correlation between the mesoscale viscoelasticity and local DNA density suggested that size of gap and flexibility of chromatin meshwork structures, which are modulated depending on chromatin condensation state, determine mesoscale viscoelasticity, with various rates of contribution in different differentiation stages. Given that chromatin within the nucleus condenses into heterochromatin as stem cells adopt a specific lineage by restricting transcription, viscoelasticity is perhaps a key factor in cooperative regulation of the nuclear mechanosensitivity and gene expression pattern for stem cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3215485559,"Subretinal fibrosis is a key pathological feature in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Previously, we identified soluble very low-density lipoprotein receptor (sVLDLR) as an endogenous Wnt signaling inhibitor. This study investigates whether sVLDLR plays an anti-fibrogenic role in nAMD models, including Vldlr-/- mice and laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV). We found that fibrosis factors including P-Smad2/3, α-SMA, and CTGF were upregulated in the subretinal area of Vldlr-/- mice and the laser-induced CNV model. The antibody blocking Wnt co-receptor LRP6 significantly attenuated the overexpression of fibrotic factors in these two models. Moreover, there was a significant reduction of sVLDLR in the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) in the laser-induced CNV model. A transgenic strain (sVLDLR-Tg) with sVLDLR overexpression in the IPM was generated. Overexpression of sVLDLR ameliorated the profibrotic changes in the subretinal area of the laser-induced CNV model. In addition, Wnt and TGF-β signaling synergistically promoted fibrogenesis in human primary retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated LRP6 gene knockout (KO) attenuated this synergistic effect. The disruption of VLDLR expression promoted, while the overexpression of sVLDLR inhibited TGF-β-induced fibrosis. These findings suggest that overactivated Wnt signaling enhances the TGF-β pathway in subretinal fibrosis. sVLDLR confers an antifibrotic effect, at least partially, through the inhibition of Wnt signaling and thus, has therapeutic potential for fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3215949370,"The current increase in European forest resources forms a singularity across the globe. Whether this trend will persist, and how biological and economic trends feature it form crucial issues to green economy challenges and C sequestration. The present screening of Forest Europe 2015 statistics explored the features, inertia and limits of this expansion, and its relationships with countries’ development, forest management and trade, intense in this area of the world. Persisting footprint of past demographic pressure on forests was identified, with opposed traces on their area and growing stock density. Steady growing stock (GS) increases, proportional to GS, not density-limited, and sustained by forest area increases, supported the view of an inflationary forest dynamic. Economic development and liberalism fostered both forest exploitation and production, yielding no significant impact on GS changes. Wood exports exerted a tension on forest exploitation and GS changes, thus lowering GS inflation but providing a resource security margin in the face of expected climate threats. Conflicting a common view, GS inflation and moderate felling-to-increment ratios make increased use of wood resources and C sequestration reconcilable, and GS expansion timely for ongoing EU forest policy processes. Anticipated adverse impacts of ongoing climate change were not clearly identified in these statistics."
https://openalex.org/W4226095075,"Antibiotic resistance is becoming a severe obstacle in the fight against acute and chronic infectious diseases that accompany most degenerative illnesses from neoplasia to osteo-arthritis and obesity. Currently, the race is on to identify pharmaceutical molecules or combinations of molecules able to prevent or reduce the insurgence and/or progression of infectivity. Attempts to substitute antibiotics with antimicrobial peptides have, thus far, met with little success against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial strains. During the last decade, we designed and studied the activity and features of human β-defensin analogs, which are salt-resistant, and hence active also under high salt concentrations as, for instance, in cystic fibrosis. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and major features of a new 21 aa long molecule, peptide γ2. The latter derives from the γ-core of the β-defensin natural molecules, a small fragment of these molecules still bearing high antibacterial activity. We found that peptide γ2, which contains only one disulphide bond, recapitulates most of the biological properties of natural human β-defensins and can also counteract both Gram-positive and Gram-negative MDR bacterial strains and biofilm formation. Moreover, it has great stability in human serum thereby enhancing its antibacterial presence and activity without cytotoxicity in human cells. In conclusion, peptide γ2 is a promising new weapon also in the battle against intractable infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4226154830,"Rotator cuff tendon injuries often occur at the tendon-to-bone interface (i.e., enthesis) area, with a high prevalence for the elderly population, but the underlying reason for this phenomenon is still unknown. The objective of this study is to identify the histological, molecular, and biomechanical alterations of the rotator cuff enthesis with maturation and aging in a mouse model. Four different age groups of mice (newborn, young, adult, and old) were studied. Striking variations of the entheses were observed between the newborn and other matured groups, with collagen content, proteoglycan deposition, collagen fiber dispersion was significantly higher in the newborn group. The compositional and histological features of young, adult, and old groups did not show significant differences, except having increased proteoglycan deposition and thinner collagen fibers at the insertion sites in the old group. Nanoindentation testing showed that the old group had a smaller compressive modulus at the insertion site when compared with other groups. However, tensile mechanical testing reported that the old group demonstrated a significantly higher failure stress when compared with the young and adult groups. The proteomics analysis detected dramatic differences in protein content between newborn and young groups but minor changes among young, adult, and old groups. These results demonstrated: (1) the significant alterations of the enthesis composition and structure occur from the newborn to the young time period; (2) the increased risk of rotator cuff tendon injuries in the elderly population is not solely because of old age alone in the rodent model."
https://openalex.org/W3214738850,"Both active and passive cigarette smoking have previously been associated with orofacial cleft aetiology. We aimed to analyse the impact of declining active smoking prevalence and the implementation of smoke-free legislation on the incidence of children born with a cleft lip and/or palate within the United Kingdom.We conducted regression analysis using national administrative data in the United Kingdom between 2000-2018. The main outcome measure was orofacial cleft incidence, reported annually for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and separately for Scotland. First, we conducted an ecological study with longitudinal time-series analysis using smoking prevalence data for females over 16 years of age. Second, we used a natural experiment design with interrupted time-series analysis to assess the impact of smoke-free legislation. Over the study period, the annual incidence of orofacial cleft per 10,000 live births ranged from 14.2-16.2 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and 13.4-18.8 in Scotland. The proportion of active smokers amongst females in the United Kingdom declined by 37% during the study period. Adjusted regression analysis did not show a correlation between the proportion of active smokers and orofacial cleft incidence in either dataset, although we were unable to exclude a modest effect of the magnitude seen in individual-level observational studies. The data in England, Wales and Northern Ireland suggested an 8% reduction in orofacial cleft incidence (RR 0.92, 95%CI 0.85 to 0.99; P = 0.024) following the implementation of smoke-free legislation. In Scotland, there was weak evidence for an increase in orofacial cleft incidence following smoke-free legislation (RR 1.16, 95%CI 0.94 to 1.44; P = 0.173).These two ecological studies offer a novel insight into the influence of smoking in orofacial cleft aetiology, adding to the evidence base from individual-level studies. Our results suggest that smoke-free legislation may have reduced orofacial cleft incidence in England, Wales and Northern Ireland."
https://openalex.org/W3214964282,"Healthcare professionals (HCPs) play a pivotal role in ensuring access to quality healthcare of patients. However, their role in health promotion (HP) and disease prevention (DP) has not been fully explored. This study aimed at determining how training, attitude, and practice (TAP) of HCPs influence their practice of HP and DP.Data on TAP regarding HP and DP were collected from 495 HCPs from twenty-three hospitals in the study area using a standardized questionnaire. Bivariate, univariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted to describe how the TAP of HCPs influence their HP and DP practices. The analysis was further desegregated at the three levels of healthcare (primary, secondary and tertiary levels).Most of the medical doctors 36.12% (n = 173), registered nurses 28.39% (n = 136), and allied health professionals (AHPs) 11.27% (n = 54) indicated the absence of coordinated HP training for staff in their facilities. Similarly, 32.93% (n = 193) of the HCPs, indicated having participated in HP or DP training. Among those that had participated in HP and DP training, benefits of training were positive behaviour, attributions, and emotional responses. When compared at the different levels of healthcare, enhanced staff satisfaction and continuing professional development for HP were statistically significant only at the tertiary healthcare level. Multivariate analysis showed a likelihood of reduced coordinated HP training for staff among medical doctors (Coef 0.15; 95% CI 0.07-0.32) and AHPs (Coef 0.24; 95% CI 0.10-0.59) compared to nurses. Furthermore, medical doctors (Coeff: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46-0.94) were less likely to agree that HCPs should model good health behavior to render HP services as compared to nurses.Training in HP and DP empowers HCPs with the requisite knowledge and attitude necessary for effective practice. Several HCPs at different levels of care had limited knowledge of HP and DP because of inadequate training. We recommend a strategy aimed at addressing the knowledge and attitudinal gaps of HCPs to ensure effective HP and DP services to patients."
https://openalex.org/W3215259931,"The present study used EEG/ERPs to detect the activation of implicit stereotypical representations associated to other-race (OR) people and the modulation of such activation through the previous presentation of positive vs. neutral social information. Electrophysiological signals were recorded in 40 Italian Caucasian participants, unaware of the overall study’s purpose. They were presented with 285 sentences that could either violate, non-violate (e.g., “the Roma girl was involved in a robbery) or be neutral with regard to stereotypical concepts concerning other-race people (e.g. Asians, Africans, Arabic). ERPs were time-locked to the terminal words. Prior to the sentence reading task, participants were exposed to a 10 minutes colourful video documentary. While the experimental group was presented a video containing images picturing other-race characters involved in “prestigious” activities that violated stereotypical negative assumptions (e.g. a black neurosurgeon leading a surgery team), the control group viewed a neutral documentary about flora and fauna. EEG signals were then recorded during the sentence reading task to explore whether the previous exposure to the experimental video could modulate the detection of incongruence in the sentences violating stereotypes, as marked by the N400 response. A fictitious task was adopted, consisted in detecting rare animal names. Indeed, only the control group showed a greater N400 response (350–550 ms) to words incongruent with ethnic stereotypes compared to congruent and neutral ones, thus suggesting the presence of a racial bias. No N400 response was found for the experimental group, suggesting a lack of negative expectation for OR individuals. The swLORETA inverse solution, performed on the prejudice-related N400 showed that the Inferior Temporal and the Superior and Middle Frontal Gyri were the strongest N400 intra-cortical sources. Regardless of the experimental manipulation, Congruent terminal words evoked a greater P300 response (500–600 ms) compared to incongruent and neutral ones and a late frontal positivity (650–800 ms) was found to be larger to sentences involving OR than own-race characters (either congruent or incongruent with the prejudice) thus possibly indicating bias-free perceptual in-group/out-group categorization processes. The data showed how it is possible to modulate a pre-existing racial prejudice (as reflected by N400 effect) through exposure to positive media-driven information about OR people. Further follow-up studies should determine the duration in time, and across contexts, of this modulatory effect."
https://openalex.org/W3216158221,"Biochemical data have shown aggregated G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) in the cytoplasm and Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD). Properly folded GPR37 at the plasma membrane appears to be neuroprotective. GPR37, and its homologue GPR37L1, are orphan G protein-coupled receptors and their homo- and hetero-dimers have not been established. We therefore examined GPR37 and GPR37L1 dimerization and extended studies of multimerization of GPR37 to live cells. In this study, we investigated GPR37 and GPR37L1 dimerization and multimerization in live cells using three quantitative imaging methods: Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy, Förster Resonance Energy Transfer, and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy. Our data show that GPR37 and GPR37L1 form homo- and heterodimers in live N2a cells. Importantly, aggregation of GPR37, but not GPR37L1, was identified in the cytoplasm, which could be counteracted by Parkin overexpression. These data provide further evidence that GPR37 participate in cytosolic aggregation processes implicated in PD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3216205237,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and pharmaceutical interventions (PIs) to reduce transmission and minimise morbidity and mortality, whilst maintaining social and economic activities. The perceptions of public health workers (PHWs) and healthcare workers (HCWs) are essential to inform future COVID-19 strategies as they are viewed as trusted sources and are at the forefront of COVID-19 response. The objectives of this study were to 1) describe the practicality of implementing NPIs and PIs and 2) identify potential barriers to implementation, as perceived by HCWs and PHWs.We conducted a cross-sectional study of PHWs and HCWs perceptions of the implementation, practicality of, and barriers to implementation of NPIs and PIs using an online survey (28/9/2020-1/11/2020) available in English, French and Portuguese. We used descriptive statistics and thematic analysis to analyse quantitative and qualitative responses.In total, 226 respondents (67 HCWs and 159 PHWs) from 52 countries completed the survey and 222 were included in the final analysis. Participants from low and middle-income countries (LMICs) accounted for 63% of HCWs and 67% of PHWs, with the remaining from high-income (HICs). There was little difference between the perceptions of PHWs and HCWs in HICs and LMICs, with the majority regarding a number of common NPIs as difficult to implement. However, PHWs in HICs perceived restrictions on schools and educational institutions to be more difficult to implement, with a lack of childcare support identified as the main barrier. Additionally, most contact tracing methods were perceived to be more difficult to implement in HICs than LMICs, with a range of barriers reported. A lack of public support was the most commonly reported barrier to NPIs overall across both country income and professional groups. Similarly, public fear of vaccine safety and lack of vaccine supply were the main reported barriers to implementing a COVID-19 vaccine. However, PHWs and HCWs in LMICs perceived a lack of financial support and the vaccine being manufactured in another country as additional barriers.This snapshot provides insight into the difficulty of implementing interventions as perceived by PHWs and HCWs. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to implementing interventions, and barriers in different contexts do vary. Barriers to implementing a vaccine programme expressed here by HCWs and PHCWs have subsequently come to the fore internationally."
https://openalex.org/W3217108809,"Finding objects and motifs across artworks is of great importance for art history as it helps to understand individual works and analyze relations between them. The advent of digitization has produced extensive digital art collections with many research opportunities. However, manual approaches are inadequate to handle this amount of data, and it requires appropriate computer-based methods to analyze them. This article presents a visual search algorithm and user interface to support art historians to find objects and motifs in extensive datasets. Artistic image collections are subject to significant domain shifts induced by large variations in styles, artistic media, and materials. This poses new challenges to most computer vision models which are trained on photographs. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a multi-style feature aggregation that projects images into the same distribution, leading to more accurate and style-invariant search results. Our retrieval system is based on a voting procedure combined with fast nearest-neighbor search and enables finding and localizing motifs within an extensive image collection in seconds. The presented approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and search time on various datasets and applies to large and inhomogeneous collections. In addition to the search algorithm, we introduce a user interface that allows art historians to apply our algorithm in practice. The interface enables users to search for single regions, multiple regions regarding different connection types and holds an interactive feedback system to improve retrieval results further. With our methodological contribution and easy-to-use user interface, this work manifests further progress towards a computer-based analysis of visual art."
https://openalex.org/W3217153192,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether the lack of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in mature adipocytes of obese mice ( Stat5 Adipoq mice) improves glucose and lipid metabolism as previously observed in lean mice. Male Stat5 Adipoq mice and their wild type (WT) littermates were fed high-fat diet (HFD). Effects of adipocyte STAT5 deficiency on adiposity as well as on glucose and lipid metabolism were determined under ad libitum feeding and after weight loss induced by calorie restriction. Compared to WT mice, obese Stat5 Adipoq mice showed modestly accelerated weight gain and blunted depletion of fat stores under calorie restriction (reduction in % body fat after 3 weeks: WT, -9.3±1.1, vs Stat5 Adipoq , -5.9±0.8, p = 0.04). No differences were observed between S tat5 Adipoq and WT mice with regard to parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism including basal glycaemia, glucose tolerance, and plasma triglycerides. In conclusion, STAT5 deficiency in the adipocyte of HFD-fed obese mice was associated with increased fat accumulation. In contrast to previous findings in lean mice, however, lipid accumulation was not associated with any improvement in glucose and lipid metabolism. Our results do not support adipocyte STAT5 as a promising target for the treatment of obesity-associated metabolic derangements."
https://openalex.org/W3215446946,"While most animals play, only humans play games. As animal play serves to teach offspring important life-skills in a safe scenario, human games might, in similar ways, teach important culturally relevant skills. Humans in all cultures play games; however, it is not clear whether variation in the characteristics of games across cultural groups is related to group-level attributes. Here we investigate specifically whether the cooperativeness of games covaries with socio-ecological differences across cultural groups. We hypothesize that cultural groups that engage in frequent inter-group conflict, cooperative sustenance acquisition, or that have less stratified social structures, might more frequently play cooperative games as compared to groups that do not share these characteristics. To test these hypotheses, we gathered data from the ethnographic record on 25 ethnolinguistic groups in the Austronesian language family. We show that cultural groups with higher levels of inter-group conflict and cooperative land-based hunting play cooperative games more frequently than other groups. Additionally, cultural groups with higher levels of intra-group conflict play competitive games more frequently than other groups. These findings indicate that games are not randomly distributed among cultures, but rather relate to the socio-ecological settings of the cultural groups that practice them. We argue that games serve as training grounds for group-specific norms and values and thereby have an important function in enculturation during childhood. Moreover, games might server an important role in the maintenance of cultural diversity."

The prevalence of NASH and its associated risk factors in community populations are relatively unknown. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of NASH and advanced liver fibrosis using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), and determine those risk factors in health examinees with asymptomatic fatty liver.This study consecutively selected subjects who underwent health checkups at 13 health-promotion centers in 10 Korean cities between 2018 and 2020. Hepatic steatosis and stiffness were assessed using ultrasonography and MRE, respectively. Stages of liver stiffness were estimated using MRE with cutoff values for NASH and advanced liver fibrosis of 2.91 and 3.60 kPa, respectively.The overall prevalence of NASH and advanced liver fibrosis in the subjects with fatty liver were 8.35% and 2.04%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that central obesity (OR = 5.12, 95% CI = 2.70-9.71), increased triglyceride (OR = 3.29, 95% CI = 1.72-6.29), abnormal liver function test (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.66-5.76) (all P<0.001), and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR = 5.18, 95% CI = 1.78-15.05) (P = 0.003) were associated with NASH. The main risk factor for advanced liver fibrosis was diabetes (OR = 4.46, 95% CI = 1.14-17.48) (P = 0.032).NASH or advanced liver fibrosis is found in one-tenth of health examinees with asymptomatic fatty liver. This suggests that early detection of NASH should be considered to allow early interventions such as lifestyle changes to prevent the adverse effects of NASH and its progression in health examinees with asymptomatic fatty liver."
https://openalex.org/W3217111450,"Objective This study aimed to identify the biomarkers and mechanisms for dermatomyositis (DM) progression at the transcriptome level through a combination of microarray and bioinformatic analyses. Method Microarray datasets for skeletal muscle of DM and healthy control (HC) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by using GEO2R. Enrichment analyses were performed to understand the functions and enriched pathways of DEGs. A protein–protein interaction network was constructed to identify hub genes. The top 10 hub genes were validated by other GEO datasets. The diagnostic accuracy of the top 10 hub genes for DM was evaluated using the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve. Result A total of 63 DEGs were identified between 10 DM samples and 9 HC samples. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis indicated that DEGs are mostly enriched in response to virus, defense response to virus, and type I interferon signaling pathway. 10 hub genes and 3 gene cluster modules were identified by Cytoscape. The identified hub genes were verified by GSE1551 and GSE11971 datasets and proven to be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of DM. Conclusion Our work identified 10 valuable genes as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of DM and explored the potential underlying molecular mechanism of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3216425636,"Focusing on the problem incurred during particle swarm optimization (PSO) that tends to fall into local optimization when solving Nash equilibrium solutions of games, as well as the problem of slow convergence when solving higher order game pay off matrices, this paper proposes an improved Predator-Prey particle swarm optimization (IPP-PSO) algorithm based on a Predator-Prey particle swarm optimization (PP-PSO) algorithm. First, the convergence of the algorithm is advanced by improving the distribution of the initial predator and prey. By improving the inertia weight of both predator and prey, the problem of ""precocity"" of the algorithm is improved. By improving the formula used to represent particle velocity, the problems of local optimizations and slowed convergence rates are solved. By increasing pathfinder weight, the diversity of the population is increased, and the global search ability of the algorithm is improved. Then, by solving the Nash equilibrium solution of both a zero-sum game and a non-zero-sum game, the convergence speed and global optimal performance of the original PSO, the PP-PSO and the IPP-PSO are compared. Simulation results demonstrated that the improved Predator-Prey algorithm is convergent and effective. The convergence speed of the IPP-PSO is significantly higher than that of the other two algorithms. In the simulation, the PSO does not converge to the global optimal solution, and PP-PSO approximately converges to the global optimal solution after about 40 iterations, while IPP-PSO approximately converges to the global optimal solution after about 20 iterations. Furthermore, the IPP-PSO is superior to the other two algorithms in terms of global optimization and accuracy."
